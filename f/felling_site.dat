40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a research dealing with operating efficiency of articulated and tractor assemblies in the plots of poplar plantations in which different means of work were used for felling and cross-cutting. The aim was to study the effects of the arrangement of wood assortments on the driving speed of the vehicle, the time needed to load and manipulate the vehicle and the overall working efficiency of forwarders. The research was carried out in Vojvodina, in the area of PE »Vojvodina šume«. Altogether 170 transport cycles were recorded and 2166. 73 m 3 transported. The research results show that the forwarder moved faster on the <b>felling</b> <b>site</b> where the felling and cross-cutting operations were carried out by a harvester. The speed was 10 % higher and it took 5 % less time to load the forwarder. The differences were considerably greater concerning the manipulation time (maneuvering and positioning the vehicle during the loading). The driving speed decreased with an increase in the load volume. Fuel consumption was lower in the <b>felling</b> <b>site</b> where a harvester was used for felling. Under the same working conditions, the tractor assembly achieved better productivity because it drove at considerably higher speeds. The differences in the average load volume were not so great, which significantly affected the productivity of the tractor assembly. The initial hypothesis that a forwarder achieves better working efficiency in the <b>felling</b> <b>site,</b> where a harvester has been used in the operations of felling and cross-cutting, was confirmed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how the number of {{cultural}} remains, the area of the final <b>felling</b> <b>site</b> and the forest owner’s knowledge, attitude and behavior related to the consideration taken to cultural environments. The study was built upon results from the HK-inventory as well as qualitative interviews with seven forest owners.   The results indicated that the risk of negative impact increased when two or more cultural remains were located at the <b>felling</b> <b>site.</b> Felling sites where two or more cultural remains had been affected and where at least one of these remains was affected negatively, were also larger than those sites where adequate consideration had been taken. Furthermore, the forest owner’s knowledge and attitude could have an effect on his or her behavior in regards to cultural consideration.   Larger felling sites that affect two or more cultural remains should be extra monitored before and during felling procedures to ensure adequate consideration towards cultural environments located at the site. Forest owners can probably have an influence on consideration but need more knowledge about different types of cultural environments and how to act to achieve adequate consideration towards cultural environments in general...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of morphological analysis of the Croatian skidder ECOTRAC 120 V, as well as the research of its productivity features in timber skidding from hilly terrain after preparatory felling and from mountainous terrain after selective felling. Morphological analysis was used for determining the dependence of morphological features of the skidder ECOTRAC 120 V, as well as for establishing its belonging to the skidder’s family. The characteristics of the researched skidder are small width relative to length, due to the requirements of its manoeuvrability in timber skidding on skid roads of up to 2. 5 m in width, and higher engine power relative to skidder mass. Such considerations give justification for morphological analyses, because they provide the possibility of observing development trends of machines, as well as ways of finding the right design solutions for meeting the requirements for their use. The comparison of two working sites in the research of productivity of skidders clearly shows that productivity primarily depends on harvesting density (working time at the <b>felling</b> <b>site)</b> and skidding speed, and that in this case a considerable difference {{in the size of the}} load is not a key factor of productivity in timber skidding...|$|E

The research was performed in various operating conditions in the area of FE "Banat" Pančevo. On the basis {{of the results of the}} analysis of variance, the data recorded in a variety of conditions were grouped. In addition, the dependence of fuel consumption on the average volume of tour was estimated. The results of the conducted analysis indicate that operating conditions significantly affect fuel consumption of the investigated vehicles. The elements of statistical analysis of the dependence of fuel consumption on the volume of load indicate that an increase in load causes increased fuel consumption per unit of production. Having in mind the results of the analysis of variance, unique norms of fuel consumption were adopted for practical purposes. The highest average consumption (1. 21 L/m 3) was achieved by a tractor assembly (Same Laser 130 tractor and Imako TP 12 trailer with a Loglift 61 F hydraulic crane), while significantly lower consumption was achieved by a John Deere 1210 E forwarder (1. 06 L/m 3).

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{research}} of resistance differences in winching of logs with their thicker or thinner end turned forward. Winching represents traction of wood assortments on the ground from the <b>felling</b> <b>site</b> to the forest vehicle equipped with a forest winch. The winching coefficient {{is determined by the}} horizontal tractive force and weight of the traction load. The research of resistance in winching wood assortments was carried out for the purpose of determining the size of the forest winch designed for equipping the prototype of the thinning tractor assembly (adapted farming tractor, forest semi-trailer and hydraulic crane) and developing an environmentally and economically viable technology for timber production. The research was carried out on flat forestland in a pedunculate oak stand by winching three logs of different weight. The research results have shown that the winching coefficients depend on the weight of logs, shape of log and their direction. Higher weight causes higher traction resistance. In all cases, the winching coefficients were higher in winching of logs with their thicker end turned forward. In order to achieve lower ground-based traction resistance and, at the same time, cause less damage to forest soil, winching of logs should be carried out with their thinner end turned forward...|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{coniferous}} plantations {{are often}} {{assumed to be}} poor habitats for bats. As a result, the impact of forest management practices on bats, such as clear felling, has received little attention, particularly in Europe. However, there is growing evidence from multiple regions that bats do make use of plantation landscapes, and as interest in siting onshore wind turbines in upland conifer plantations grows, there is an urgent need to examine whether felling prior to turbine installation is likely to put foraging bats at risk of collision. In the first study of its kind, we use a “before – after – control – impact” study to explore the short-term impacts of clear fell harvest on bat activity in commercial plantations. Thirty-one mature stands of Sitka Spruce were surveyed using acoustic detectors in three large, upland Sitka Spruce plantations in Britain. Eleven stands were felled between 2013 and 2015, and 26 of the original 31 stands were resurveyed in 2015. The change in total bat activity and species- or genus-specific bat activity was modelled before and after felling occurred at both felled and control stands using generalised linear models. There was no change in overall bat activity at <b>felled</b> <b>sites</b> compared to control sites, but activity ofNyctalusspecies was 23 times higher following felling. TotalPipistrellus spp. activity doubled at <b>felled</b> <b>sites</b> post-harvesting, although this was mainly driven by increased activity at a few <b>felled</b> <b>sites.</b> WhenP. pygmaeusandP. pipistrelluswere considered separately, activity increased slightly but non-significantly. The size of the felled area influenced activity (for bats overall andPipistrellus spp.), with 90 % higher activity in smaller felled stands (less than 5 ha− 1) compared to larger felled stands (greater than 30 ha− 1). ForP. pipistrellus, activity in felled areas decreased with the duration since harvesting; the greatest activity occurred in stands felled within two months compared to those harvested more than 16 months previously. Higher activity for some groups following felling may occur due {{to the creation of}} more edge habitat, which is preferred by bothPipistrellusspecies we recorded. An increase in activity following the small-scale felling (‘key-holing’) required for the installation of turbines could put foraging bats at risk from collisions with turbines. Further investigation of the influence of both size of clear fell patch, timing of felling and changes in invertebrate abundance due to felling are required to establish the potential risk of key-holing and turbine installation to foraging bats...|$|R

Utilization of teak wood from community forest has been practiced for decades, however information on the extent of utilization and the quantity of wood waste have not been published to a greater extent. The present research was intended to determine and analyze the extent of utilization and teak wood waste produced from felling and bucking, and on-site squarewood production of community forests.   Quantification of wood waste from felling and bucking was based on the whole tree method, while that of squarewood production was based on the percentage of yield. It was found that the quantity of teak felling and bucking wood waste in community forest was reaching 28 % of felled wood volume that consisted of branch and twig (46. 15 %), upper trunk (30. 77 %), short cut off (15. 38 %), and stumps (7. 69 %). The largest part of the wood waste of teak felling and bucking satisfied the requirement as raw material of wood working industry according to Indonesian National Standard.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of research of Timberjack 240 C tractor equipped with double-drum winch Adler HY 16 in tree-length skidding method. The research was conducted in Euro-American poplar clearcut using time and work study method. Timber processing was done by teamwork of two fellers, one tractor driver and one feller-crosscutter (Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). The volume of 759. 03 m 3 was skidded in 88 cycles from an average skidding distance of 760 m. The average load volume was 8. 63 m 3, and it consisted of 5. 2 pieces with an average volume of 1. 66 m 3. During the research the tractor accomplished 68. 63 % of total time as effective time with delay time of 31. 37 % (Fig. 6). Travel unloaded accounted for 14. 39 % of total time, travel loaded 23. 91 %, <b>felling</b> <b>site</b> work 14. 33 % and landing work 16. 00 %. Daily output of 63. 25 m 3 /day was achieved with average total time consumption of 359. 32 min/day. The said total time consumption accounts for 78. 86 % of the legal working time (480 min). Variable times (travel loaded and unloaded by skid trails and landing, line pulling and winching) were analyzed by mathematical and statistical methods (Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10). All other effective times were regarded as fixed and calculated as averages of recorded time. In effective time per turn, for skidding distance of 600 m (skid trail) plus 150 m (landing), travel times account for 18. 14 min and <b>felling</b> <b>site</b> and landing work times account for 15. 91 min. The effective time per turn, for skidding distance of 600 m (+ 150 m), is 34. 05 min. With determined allowance time factor of 1. 30, total time is 44. 36 min. The average travel speed on skid trails is 6. 52 km/h for unloaded tractor and 3. 87 km/h for loaded tractor. The average travel speed on landing is 5. 61 km/h for unloaded tractor and 3. 73 km/h for loaded tractor (Table 2). The average speed of line pulling for the left drum is 0. 97 km/h and the average speed of winching is 1. 02 km/h. And for the right drum, the average speed of line pulling is 0. 94 km/h and the average speed of winching is 0. 85 km/h. (Fig. 3) Standard time of skidding ranges from 3. 71 min/m 3 (100 m) to 6. 29 min/m 3 (1000 m). The daily output for the average load volume ranges between 129. 52 m 3 /day for skidding distance of 100 m and 76. 34 m 3 /day for skidding distance of 1000 m. For skidding distances from 100 m to 1000 m, the skidding cost ranges from 22. 18 HRK/m 3 to 37. 63 HRK/m 3. The impact of different average load volumes on daily output and skidding cost is shown in Table 5 and Fig. 11. The results of this research show that Timberjack 240 C tractor belongs to a group of highly-efficient special forest timber skidding machines. The principle of load size effect, as one of the key factors of timber skidding, on skidding productivity in different skidding distances has been proven by this detailed research. Hence, by increasing the load volume and decreasing the average skidding distance, the productivity of this tractor is significantly increased, thus lowering the cost per unit...|$|E

Alometrijske funkcije konstruirane su na temelju podataka prikupljenih neposredno in situ destruktivnom metodom. Prema uzgojnom obliku sastojine A i C su visokog uzgojnog oblika, dok je sastojina B panjača. Sastojine A i B su brdske bukove šume kojima se gospodari regularno, a sastojina C je preborna jelovo-bukova šuma. Na svakom lokalitetu posječen je i izmjeren određen broj stabala, pri čemu se posebna pozornost posvetila  na reprezentativnost uzorka (prsni promjer) s obzirom na distri­bu­ciju doznačenih stabala. Svakom posječenom stablu izmjereni su prsni promjer i visina (duljina). Obujam krupnoga drva promjera > 7 cm utvrđen je metodom sekcioniranja. Grane promjera od 3 cm do 7 cm s korom izmjerene su, odnosno sekcionirane kao i krupno drvo, a ostalom dijelu sitne granjevine tanjem od 3 cm određena je masa u svježem stanju. Oblikovanje izračuna biomase triju sastavnica, kao i ukupne nadzemne biomase, izvršeno je prema tri različita modela. Za ocjenu modela korištena su dva parametra, koeficijent determinacije (R 2) te drugi korijen prosječne kvadratne pogreške (RMSE). Na osnovi navedenih parametra, za ocjenu modela najbolji model za procjenu svih triju sastavnica te ukupne nadzemne biomase je model 2 – eksponencijalna jednadžba s dvije nezavisne varijable (d, h) i tri koeficijenta. Od preostala dva ispitivana modela, najbolji se pokazao model 1 i to u 9 slučajeva, što je bilo pomalo neočekivano, jer model 3, koji kao nezavisnu varijablu koristi obujam stabala iz lokalnih tarifa propisanih osnovom gospodarenja, već obuhvaća informacije o promjeru i visini stabala. Najveći pri­nos biomase očekivano je u sastojinama viših boniteta. Povećanjem prsnog promjera stabla povećava se postotni udio biomase krupnog drva promjera > 7 cm u ukupnoj nadzemnoj biomasi stabla, a to povećanje najizraziti­je je u regularnoj sastojini II boniteta. Udio biomase granjevine promjera 3 – 7 cm gotovo je konstantan promjenom prs­nog promjera stabla, dok se biomasa treće sastavnice (granjevina 7 cm was {{determined}} by the sectioning method. Branches with a diameter of 3 cm to 7 cm with bark was measured (sectioned)   {{and for the rest of}} the brushwood, thinner than 3 cm, fresh mass {{was determined}}. In felling sites A and B research was conducted in the dormant season, and in the <b>felling</b> <b>site</b> C research was conducted during the growing season. Therefore, the amount of brushwood thinner diameter than 3 cm biomass included foliar biomass. Modeling of three components of biomass, and total aboveground biomass was carried out according to equations 1, 2 and 3, Equation 1 uses dbh as input with two coefficients (a i b), in Equation 2 an additional independent variable (tree height) was included in order to improve the model and it contains three coefficients (a, b and c). When planning harvesting operations, under the felling plan based on dbh of the marked trees (which are directly measured) with the help of prescribed tariffs planned gross volume of a tree in a specified dbh class is calculated. For this reason (availability of data) in equation 3 volume of tree from tariffs is included as the independent variable with two coefficients a and b. For the evaluation of the models two parameterswere used, the coefficient of determination (R 2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Based on these parameters the best model for the calculation of all three abovegaround biomass components and for the total aboveground biomass is model 2, the exponential equation with two independent variables (d, h), and three coefficients (Table 4). In 11 of the 12 cases this model gives the best results. After the model 2, from the other two models tested, the best model has proven to be the model 1 (in 9 cases). This is somewhat unexpected because the remaining  model 3, which uses the volume of tree calculated on the basis of local tariffs prescribed by the management plan as an independent parameter, already includes information on the diameter and height of trees. Therefore, it was expected that this model will be better than model 1, but that was not determined in this study. Mentioned model 3 proved to be better in just 3 cases. Determining the amount of two categories of aboveground biomass wita a diameter less than 7 cm is particularly important because in the traditional wood harvesting this part of the forest residue usually remains unused, and in the production of wood chips is a usable income potential of our forests. When comparing the features of marked and cut trees from three different felling areas, the highest yield of biomass is in the stands of higher site index, as expected. By increasing the dbh of trees the percentage of the biomass of wood > 7 cm in total aboveground tree biomass increases, and this increase was most pronounced in the regular stand of the site index II. The share of brushwood 3 – 7 cm biomass is almost constant when dbh increases, while the share of the third component of biomass (branches < 3 cm) reduces by increasing the dbh, which is more noticeable in regular stands. Models proposed in this paper can represent the basis for further research in order to improve the planning of the production process and the subsequent analysis of felling results. Biomass of a diameter less than 7 cm represents a special potential, which share in certain stand conditions can reach over 10 % of the total aboveground biomass of trees with larger dbh (including foliar biomass), and over 20 % of the total aboveground biomass of trees with the smaller dbh (Figure 5) ...|$|E

40|$|People {{have used}} animals as beasts of burden and of {{cultivation}} {{since the early}} days of agriculture. Buffalo, cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, camels, elephants and even dogs have played crucial roles in food production and transportation in a variety of environments. Increasingly, they have been replaced by motors but, with the costs rising for machines, spare parts, and fuel, the potential of animal power must be re-examined Draught animals are still in use in most ACP countries even though in reduced numbers. Could numbers be increased and could draught animals be introduced into areas where they were previously unknown, now that factors that prevented their use in the past have changed? Until recently, for example, Africa had a low population density that enabled slash and burn agriculture which was not suited to animal drawn implements which would constantly snag on tree roots. Also, in many parts of Africa the tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis precluded the use of draught animals. However now that the tsetse fly has been cleared from parts of its previous range, cattle, horses, donkeys and mules can play a major role in relieving farmers of the drudgery of hand cultivation and even seeding and weeding. For instance, in West Africa, where more than 90 % of food is still produced by small farmers, production is still from small plots of land using such simple tools as the axe, machete and hoe. Using these traditional implements, and a great deal of human energy, a farmer can cultivate up to two hectares of savanna land or half this amount in forest areas. The use of draught animals can dramatically increase the area under cultivation. In some savanna sites in West Africa, where the oxplough has been successfully introduced over the last 30 years, a team of two oxen can cultivate up to 15 ha although 6 ha is the usual average. Importance of tradition Significantly, the greatest level of success with draught animals occurs where the people have a tradition of both animal husbandry and cultivation, such as among the Fulani in the Gomba district of Nigeria. Pastoralists take readily to using animal power because of their understanding of both nutrition and disease and because they are used to handling animals, which is a small step to harnessing, training and controlling them in work. In Burkina Faso, oxen were introduced in an area where 95 % of farmers had only hand tools. The use of the animals resulted in increased food production, reduced waste and improved soil fertility. In addition, farmers' incomes were raised, jobs were provided for local craftsmen (making harnesses, ploughs and harrows) and the quality of life for many people in these rural communities was improved. Traditionally, men have been responsible for most of the land clearance and cultivation and women have been the seeders and weeders. So, it is important that where draught power is introduced for cultivation its impact on women's workload in seeding and weeding is anticipated. Now that ox-drawn seeders and weeding tools are available, it is essential that they too are introduced or the greater amount of cultivated land will overwhelm the available female labour force, and potential increases in productivity will be lost through late planting and uncontrolled weed competition. This may require some adjustment of attitudes to male and female roles since it is usual for men and boys to work draught animals and women to hand labour, and both sexes need to see the advantages of redistribution of responsibilities and workload Where there is no tradition of animal husbandry, for instance in previously forested areas, the successful introduction of draught animals can take longer and succeeds only if it is complemented by introducing farming families to animal nutrition, forage production, and animal health and handling. Any natural reluctance towards, and even fear of, livestock must be overcome by building up the knowledge and confidence which lead to competence. Alternative to mechanization Despite the apparent advantages and attraction of mechanized equipment, under the conditions found in most ACP countries draught animals often prove to be a better option. A World Bank report which examined tractor-hire projects in sub-Saharan Africa found that animals were better suited to Africa's unique conditions. Its relatively thin soil is easily damaged by tractors and all tree stumps in cleared areas have to be removed for tractors to operate satisfactorily -thus increasing the risk of soil erosion [...] whereas animals can work even if a few stumps remain. The Bank report also concluded that mechanization in Africa merelysaves labour and, in a finding that could have considerable repercussions in developing countries in general, the report states that changing from hoes to tractor ploughs 'hardly affects yields at all'. Consequently, the introduction of mechanized equipment simply causes a loss of jobs. 'As long as wages are low, draught animals are more costeffective than tractors,' was the conclusion of the report. The running and replacement cost of mechanized equipment is proving increasingly unaffordable for small and even medium-sized farmers in ACP countries and breakdowns or fuel shortages at critical times of the year can jeopardize a harvest. In contrast, draught animals can be bred locally and feed can also be produced on the farm. Draught animals also produce significant quantities of dung, which is valuable for maintaining soil fertility, and the animals can be consumed at the end of their working life. In some situations, animals actually increase in value as they mature and put on weight. For example, in Togo, a two-year old bull calf weighing 200 kg and costing about 40, 000 CFA, five years later would be worth 80, 000 CFA (based on 1985 prices). However, keeping draught animals is not without cost, and for subsistence farmers who cultivate one or two hectares there are economic risks. In many seasonally arid regions, draught animals are needed for cultivation for only a few weeks of the year and trained oxen may spend ten months each year doing little or no work. Using cows for draught as well as for milk and calf production offers a way of reducing the cost disadvantage of oxen. In a number of countries in Asia, cows are commonly used for draught where feed for livestock is scarce. The use of cows for draught has also been reported in Egypt, Ethiopia, Senegal, Tanzania and Zambia Oxen have the advantage of greater size and strength to provide a greater work output than cows, but a two draught cow system can produce approximately the same work output as an ox plus two non-draught cow system and yet uses 28 % less energy input. This represents a considerable annual saving of fodder. If cows are well fed, the effects of work may be negligible. Obviously, cows cannot be used for draught for about two months when they calve but the timing of matings can ensure that parturition and peak work demand do not coincide. It is noteworthy that the small N'Dama cattle of Sierra Leone have proved useful draught animals despite their size Draught animals for forestry The elephant has long been associated with timber extraction in the forests of southeast Asia but oxen, horses and mules have also been used widely and successfully in many countries. Teak in Java is hauled from <b>felling</b> <b>site</b> to trucking point by teams of two oxen. In Zimbabwe, mules and oxen have been used for many years; and in Malawi trials have shown that trained pairs of oxen are an alternative to tractor skidding. By 1985, there were 230 skidding oxen engaged in logging operations at five major government-owned plantations in Malawi and a study was carried out to establish the relative benefits of ox and tractor skidding. In forest thinnings, the cost of skidding logs using an agricultural tractor proved to be 3. 5 times greater for downhill skidding than oxen; and on flat terrain tractors were 7. 6 times more costly than oxen. Of these costs, expenditure on imported goods was 59 - 99 times greater for tractors than for oxen skidding. The same trend was apparent for clearfelling as for thinnings and the overall financial advantage of using oxen rather than tractors was found to be twice as great in three-row thinning as in clearfelling and to be greater on flat than on steep terrain. Although it is often considered more prestigious to work with tractors, this study revealed that a worker using oxen is likely to be more selfreliant The future If draught animals are to be used more widely they must be used more effectively. However, despite their widespread use less is known about the draught capabilities and feed requirements of the various species used than about livestock kept for meat and milk. Several research centres are now making up this 'lost ground' including the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine (CTVM) in Edinburgh, Scotland, and the Central American School of Animal Husbandrv in Costa Rica. ILCA is appropriately based in Ethiopia, a country having the largest draught animal population in Africa [...] perhaps 50 % of the continent's draught animals. Research has included nutrition studies and has led to the development of improved harnesses and new designs of cultivating implements and soil scrapers for small dam construction. CTVM staff have served in a wide range of countries throughout the tropics and their studies have provided useful information on metabolic rates and energy demand under varying work conditions and the benefits of using new harness designs which are less restricting than traditional designs and transfer draught power more efficiently. At the Central American School of Animal Husbandry in Costa Rice, a two-year study recently concluded that oxen use less energy and may be more efficient work animals than previously accepted. FAO figures show that oxen use 2. 5 times their basic energy requirements when they are being worked but the new study suggests a figure 33 % less than this. The Costa Rica study also found that the type of work done by an ox has little effect on its energy expenditure. Light work, such as pulling a cart, used up the same amount of energy as ploughing. This also contradicts past research The quality of fodder as well as food consumption have a critical effect; oxen on poor diets could not increase their consumption of food to match the energy expended when working. Only by increasing the quality of food eaten could animals maintain bodyweights and keep up the workload. Where food quality is poor, therefore, it is better to have two oxen (or cows) doing what work they can rather than use one animal which is soon exhausted. This is an important finding which could have a significant impact in the tropics. The failure of the single-ox cultivation programme in Ethiopia may be partly a result of this factor. Overall, the potential of draught animals in Africa is considerable and this may also be the case in the Caribbean and Pacific. Now that research is providing new information, extension services may develop soundly-based programmes for the introduction or further development of draught animal power in areas where the demands for greater productivity cannot be met by hand labour and where mechanization is neither available nor economic.
