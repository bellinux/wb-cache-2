5|$|Obesity and {{metabolic}} syndrome are both {{closely related to}} plasma triglyceride levels.

Available studies show that minor APOA5 alleles could be associated with an enhanced risk of obesity or metabolic syndrome development. However, genome wide studies <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> prove that APOA5 is a gene associated with BMI values and/or obesity, so the effect could be far from clinically significant or at least significantly context-dependent.|$|E

This match occurred during the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, which took place from September 10 to 25.

5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E
