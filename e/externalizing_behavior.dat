40|$|Although {{previous}} research has identified various child-specific and contextual risk factors associated with <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors,</b> there is a dearth of literature examining child × context interactions in the prospective prediction of <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> To address this gap, we examined autonomic functioning as a moderator {{of the relation between}} contextual factors (i. e., neighborhood cohesion and harsh parental <b>behaviors)</b> and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Participants were an ethnic minority, inner-city sample of first through fourth grade children (N = 57, 50 % male) and their primary caregivers who participated in two assessments approximately 1 year apart. Results indicated that baseline sympathetic functioning moderated the relation between (a) neighborhood cohesion and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> and (b) harsh parental <b>behaviors</b> and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Post-hoc probing of these interactions revealed that higher levels of neighborhood cohesion prospectively predicted (a) higher levels of <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> among children with heightened baseline sympathetic functioning, and (b) lower levels of <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> among children with attenuated baseline sympathetic functioning.

40|$|Objective. The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how the interaction of maternal parenting discipline beliefs and physical punishment behaviors was associated with <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> in toddlers. Methods. Data was collected through in-person interviews with 80 Mexican-American mothers with toddlers, reporting about their beliefs about discipline, their use of physical discipline, and their toddlers’ <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Hierarchal linear regression models were used to examine the relationship between the interaction of beliefs and <b>behaviors</b> and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors,</b> while controlling for maternal depression. Results. The interaction of beliefs and behaviors were significantly correlated with <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> There was a positive correlation between spanking frequency and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> when mothers that reported high levels of discipline beliefs, and a negative correlation between spanking frequency and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> in mothers that reported low levels of discipline beliefs. Conclusion. Beliefs and behaviors must be considered together when examining how they predict <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> It cannot be concluded that spanking alone causes externalizing outcomes in children without examining the context of the punishment...|$|R

The association between non-shared hostility in {{parenting and}} adolescent <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> was mainly explained by a child-driven effect whereby the twin with a higher level of <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> than his or her co-twin was more likely to receive more hostility from the parents. Similarly, the relationship between deviant peer affiliation and adolescent <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> supported the selection effect whereby the twin with a higher level of <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> than his or her co-twin was more likely to affiliate with deviant peers.

40|$|Early <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{can have}} {{significant}} and persistent impacts on young children's developmental trajectories (Campbell, 1994; 1995; Moffitt, 1993). High-quality teacher-child relationships {{have the potential}} to protect children living in high-risk family environments from developing <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Using Bronfenbrenner's bioecological framework, the current study explored the impact of family risks and teacher-child relationship quality on children's <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Specifically, the goals of the study were to: (a) investigate the associations between family risk factors and children's <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors,</b> (b) examine the associations between teacher-child relationship quality and children's <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors,</b> (c) examine whether teacher-child relationship quality moderates the impact of family risk on children's <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and (d) investigate the associations among teacher, student, and classroom characteristics and teacher-child relationship quality. Data were gathered from 100 Head Start children, their parents, and their teachers. Controlling for children's age and gender, results revealed that two family risk factors, parent-child dysfunctional interaction and family cohesion, significantly predicted child noncompliance. All of the teacher-child relationship quality variables including conflict, cohesion, dependency, and positive interactions significantly predicted children's <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors,</b> with conflict being the strongest and most consistent predictor. Finally, analyses on the interactions between the family risk and teacher-child relationship quality variables revealed that teacher-child conflict moderated the impact of family cohesion on child noncompliance. This finding suggested that low teacher-child conflict protects children from the impact of low family cohesion on child noncompliance, and high teacher-child conflict intensifies the impact of low family cohesion on child noncompliance. Overall, the results from this study suggest that teacher-child relationship quality may serve as both a risk and protective factor in the development of young children's <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The findings presented have important implications for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers in understanding how to strengthen teacher-child relationships as a means to promote Head Start children's competence in the behavioral domain...|$|R

40|$|According {{to recent}} theories, both person {{characteristics}} and environmental characteristics {{have to be}} taken into account in order to understand individual development. In line with these theories, the present thesis focused on the ways in which child characteristics and parental characteristics interplay in affecting an important negative outcome in toddlerhood; <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> To investigate these issues, five empirical studies were conducted. Participants of these studies were 117 toddler boys and their parents. The families were followed from the moment the children were 17 months of age until they were 35 months old. Since toddlerhood is one of the most critical periods in development with many changes for both children and their parents, four measurement waves with 6 -months intervals were used to keep track of these changes. It was found that toddlers’ <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> are predicted by both child temperament and parental personality traits and psychopathological symptoms. However, child temperament seemed to be more important than parental characteristics in predicting these <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The findings of the studies presented in this thesis also demonstrated that an exclusive focus on main effects of child and parental characteristics only partly unravels the ways in which these characteristics affect children’s <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Parental personality traits partially affected toddlers’ <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> through the impact on parenting. Above and beyond these indirect effects, parental personality was also directly associated with <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> in toddlerhood. Parenting did not affect all children to the same extent; poor parenting was found to be particularly negative for children with certain vulnerable temperamental traits. Longitudinal data provided evidence that parenting practices predict subsequent changes in the level of toddlers’ <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Additionally, changes in parenting were found to be accompanied by changes in toddlers’ <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> and vice versa. For very young children maternal parenting was stronger associated with child <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> than paternal parenting. During toddlerhood the influence of fathers seemed to become more similar to that of mothers. Consequently, later in toddlerhood disciplining techniques of both mothers and fathers affected children’s <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> However, mothers’ warmth more strongly predicted children’s <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> than fathers’ warmth. With regard to different types of child problem behaviors, both common and specific risk factors were found. Finally, parental personality traits appeared to have little distorting effect on parental reports of toddlers’ temperament, supporting the value of parental reports of children’s adjustment. Taken together, the main conclusion that can be drawn from the studies presented in this thesis, is that it is important to integrate person and environmental characteristics in research on child <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Furthermore, the results presented in this thesis indicate that attention should be paid to the contributions of both mothers and fathers, the specificity of relations between risk factors and negative child outcomes, and the longitudinal relations between these constructs...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{identified}} discrepancies in informant ratings of <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> in youth, but it is unclear whether similar discrepancies exist between informants when rating psychopathic traits.

A total of 282 children between 7 and 16  years (M =  10. 60  years, SD =  1. 91) from an outpatient child psychiatric clinic participated in this study.

40|$|In {{a sample}} of 921 {{children}} in nondivorced families, 230 children in divorced families and 35 children in remarried families assessed at age 10 through age 14, growth modeling {{was used to determine}} the basic developmental trajectories of internalizing and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> as well as mother/child attachment bond immediately following a marital transition of divorce or remarriage. I also investigated the effects of gender, mother 2 ̆ 7 s education level, and family income as well as all possible two way interactions on these trajectories. The data was obtained from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY) data set. The results demonstrated that immediately following the marital transition, early adolescents in divorced and remarried families on average exhibited higher levels of internalizing and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> compared to children in nondivorced families with children in remarried families exhibiting the highest levels. However, by three to four years later children in remarried families had begun exhibiting similar levels of internalizing and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> as children in nondivorced families. Children in recently divorced families began demonstrating similar levels of internalizing behaviors as nondivorced children by four years later but they were still demonstrating higher levels of <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> four years after the divorce. Children 2 ̆ 7 s behavioral adjustment to divorce and remarriage also significantly differed based on their mother 2 ̆ 7 s educational level. The initial effect of divorce and remarriage on adolescent 2 ̆ 7 s <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> was significantly more prominent at lower education levels than at higher education levels, particularly for children of divorce. The effect of marital status on adolescent 2 ̆ 7 s <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> over time had the opposite effect at high and low levels of mother 2 ̆ 7 s education, with children of divorced and remarried low educated mothers exhibiting a decrease in <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> over time while children of divorced and remarried highly educated mothers exhibited an increase in <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> However, this effect was significantly more prominent in children of remarried families.

50|$|A third {{example of}} a {{mediating}} variable is an increase of externalizing symptoms. King and Chassin (2008) conducted research examining the relationship between stressful life events and drug dependence in young adulthood.

In other words, stressful life events are associated with externalizing symptoms, such as aggression or hostility, {{which can lead to}} peer alienation or acceptance by socially deviant peers, which could lead to increased drug use.

50|$|A {{distinction}} is made between internalizing and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behavior.</b> Internalizing behaviors reflect withdrawal, inhibition, anxiety, and/or depression. Internalizing behavior {{has been found}} in some cases of youth violence although in some youth, depression is associated with substance abuse. Because they rarely act out, students with internalizing problems are often overlooked by school personnel. Externalizing behaviors refer to delinquent activities, aggression, and hyperactivity. Unlike internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors include, or are directly linked to, violent episodes. Violent behaviors such as punching and kicking are often learned from observing others. Just as externalizing behaviors are observed outside of school, such behaviors also observed in schools.|$|E

40|$|Abstract There is a {{well-established}} link between Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorders (CD). Individuals {{that tend to}} be more inattentive and impulsive may begin to act out as they age, thus exhibiting more problematic <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Intelligence may also be a factor in this relationship between inattentive and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> While there has been research highlighting the role of IQ in the relationship between <b>externalizing</b> and inattentive <b>behaviors</b> in individuals with intellectual disabilities, the literature on the role of average intelligence in this relationship is lacking. This study gathered data using archival clinical files from the Murray State University Psychological Center, which provides counseling services to MSU students, faculty, staff, and community members. The participants for the sample consisted of mostly Caucasian (93 %) males (60 %) in the 4 th grade (M= 4. 03, SD= 2. 40) seeking an assessment (N = 76). Measures of <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> and attentional problems were gathered from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and a measure of general cognitive ability (GAI) was gathered from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children- Fourth Edition (WISC-IV). A moderation analysis explored how the strength of the relationship between inattentive, impulsive, and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> changed as intelligence varies. It was hypothesized that the relationship between impulsivity and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> would be more pronounced when intelligence is lower.

5000|$|Students with EBD are {{a diverse}} population, {{and have a}} wide range of {{intellectual}} and academic abilities. Males, African-Americans, and economically disadvantaged students are overrepresented in the EBD population, and students with EBD are more likely to live in single-parent homes, foster homes, or other non-traditional living situations. They also tend to have low rates of positive social interactions with students and peers in instructional contexts, and many have one or more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. Students with EBD are often categorized as [...] "internalizers" [...] (e.g., have poor self-esteem, or are diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or mood disorder) or [...] "externalizers" [...] (e.g., disrupt classroom instruction, or are diagnosed with disruptive behavior disorders such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder). Male students may be overrepresented in the EBD population because they tend to exhibit disruptive <b>externalizing</b> <b>behavior</b> that interferes with classroom instruction, whereas females more commonly exhibit internalizing behavior that does not interfere with classroom instruction; thus, teachers may refer males for special education services more often than females. Students with EBD are also at an increased risk for learning disabilities, school dropout, substance abuse, and juvenile delinquency.|$|E
40|$|Martial {{arts are}} very popular among juveniles {{all over the}} world, but the {{relation}} between martial arts and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behavior</b> in juveniles remains unclear. The current multilevel meta-analysis of 12 studies, including 94 effect sizes and N = 5949 juveniles, was conducted to examine the relation between martial arts participation and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behavior</b> in juveniles, and to examine factors with a possible moderating effect. Results showed {{that there was no}} overall relation between martial arts participation and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behavior</b> in juveniles. However, a trim-and-fill procedure implicated publication bias of studies reporting that juvenile martial artist showed more <b>externalizing</b> <b>behavior</b> than non-martial artists, suggesting that the current overall outcomes might underestimate <b>externalizing</b> <b>behavior</b> in martial artists. Moderator analyses showed that studies published in higher impact factor journals, and studies with a higher training intensity in martial arts found more <b>externalizing</b> <b>behavior</b> in martial artists. Furthermore, karate was found to be less related to <b>externalizing</b> <b>behavior</b> than judo. Finally, in comparison with non-athletes and team sport athletes, martial artists showed similar levels of <b>externalizing</b> <b>behavior,</b> but they showed more <b>externalizing</b> <b>behavior</b> when compared to individual sport athletes. Implications for future policy and research are discussed...|$|E

The current study examined relationships between academic enablers (e. g., engagement, interpersonal skills, motivation, and study skills), social support, <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> (e. g., aggression, conduct problems, and hyperactivity), and academic achievement in reading (e. g., classroom reading grades, reading fluency, standardized test scores, and teacher-rated reading skills). There were 61 student participants in the study ranging from third through fifth grade at one elementary building in a middle-to-high socioeconomic status suburban area. Major findings of the study indicate that <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> are significantly and negatively related to all academic enablers and significantly and negatively related to all academic measures, including curriculum-based measurement, classroom reading grades, teacher-rated academic skills, and standardized test scores. In addition, the relationship between <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> and classroom reading grades was fully mediated by academic enablers. However, this study did not find a significant relationship between <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> and social support. Implications and future directions are discussed based on these major findings...|$|R
40|$|Literature on {{the course}} of {{children}} 2 ̆ 7 s social emotional development in early childhood is abundant. In addition, literature has identified that various family level variables {{play a role in}} a children 2 ̆ 7 s social emotional development. However, little research has utilized longitudinal panel data to investigate the relationship between children 2 ̆ 7 s social emotional development and caregiver 2 ̆ 7 s psychological well being. In this paper, latent growth curves were constructed for children 2 ̆ 7 s <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors,</b> caregiver depression, and caregiver stress. Latent growth curves were constructed for caregiver stress, caregiver depression, and child <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The mean score for participants were highest at the initial measurement points and decreased {{over the course of the}} subsequent measurement periods. A structural equation model was utilized to identify a model in which the effect of time living in poverty on <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> was mediated by caregiver depression. In addition, the effect of caregiver depression on <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors</b> was mediated by caregiver stress. Implications and limitation of this study are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the additive and interactive effects of racial socialization on internalizing and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> One hundred and thirty-six youth (mean age = 11. 49, SD = 1. 71) in fourth through eighth grade and parents of children these ages (n = 150) from 3 three locations of a community based family support agency reported on the youth 2 ̆ 7 s internalizing and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors,</b> parental behavior, and racial socialization experiences. Correlational {{analyses were conducted to}} determine the relationship between study variables. Consistent with hypotheses, supportive parenting was associated with fewer maladaptive outcomes. Racial pride messages showed a trend level association to outcomes. Regression analyses were conducted to determine if racial socialization messages added unique variance to outcomes above supportive parenting. Results indicated that racial socialization showed additive effects on internalizing behaviors when examined with supportive parenting. Regression analyses were also conducted to determine if increased racial socialization messages moderated the association of supportive parenting to internalizing and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Results indicated that racial pride messages interacted with supportive parenting to predict both internalizing and <b>externalizing</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Results are discussed in regards to the implications of additive and integrative models of racial socialization and supportive parenting in promoting adaptive functioning among low-income African-American youth...|$|R
