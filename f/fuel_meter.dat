5000|$|Chevrolet {{introduced}} a mechanical fuel injection option, made by General Motors' Rochester Products Division, for its 283 V8 engine in 1956 (1957 U.S. model year). This system directed the inducted engine air across a [...] "spoon shaped" [...] plunger that moved {{in proportion to}} the air volume. The plunger connected to the fuel metering system that mechanically dispensed fuel to the cylinders via distribution tubes. This system was not a [...] "pulse" [...] or intermittent injection, but rather a constant flow system, metering fuel to all cylinders simultaneously from a central [...] "spider" [...] of injection lines. The <b>fuel</b> <b>meter</b> adjusted the amount of flow according to engine speed and load, and included a fuel reservoir, which was similar to a carburetor's float chamber. With its own high-pressure fuel pump driven by a cable from the distributor to the <b>fuel</b> <b>meter,</b> the system supplied the necessary pressure for injection. This was a [...] "port" [...] injection where the injectors are located in the intake manifold, very near the intake valve.|$|E

40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} {{components}} {{designed to improve}} fuel economy by reducing power requirements should also result in a decrease in emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Fuel economy and NOx emissions {{of a pair of}} class 8 tractor-trailers were measured on a test track to evaluate the effects of single wide tires and trailer aerodynamic devices. Fuel economy was measured using a modified version of SAE test procedure J 1321. NOx emissions were measured using a portable emissions monitoring system (PEMS). Fuel consumption was estimated by a carbon balance on PEMS output and correlated to <b>fuel</b> <b>meter</b> measurements. Tests were conducted using drive cycles simulating highway operations at 55 mph and 65 mph and suburban stop-and-go traffic. The tests showed a negative correlation (significant at p < 0. 05) between fuel economy and NOx emissions. Single wide tires and trailer aerodynamic devices resulted in increased fuel economy and decreased NOx emissions relative to the baseline tests. Decreases in NOx emissions were disproportionately larger than increases in fuel economy; however, this effect may be an artifact of the particular engine being tested. These results demonstrate that emissions reductions can be achieved using strategies that decrease fuel use and save truck operators money...|$|E

Various nitrogen species emissions (NO, NO 2, NOx, NH 3, HCN and N 2 O) were measured at 0. 5 Hz. The tests were designed and employed using two real world driving cycles/routes representing a typical urban road network located in a densely populated area and main crowded road. Journeys at various {{times of the day}} were conducted to investigate traffic conditions impacts such as traffic and pedestrian lights, road congestion, grade and turning on emissions, engine thermal efficiency and fuel consumption. The time aligned vehicle moving parameters with Nitrogen pollutant emission data and fuel consumption enabled the micro-analysis of correlations between these parameters. The average data for journeys such as emissions, thermal efficiency and fuel consumption were presented, though this paper is focused on nitrogen compounds. Traffic events and vehicle transient movements' impact on emissions were studied. Engine power output has been calculated by using vehicle specific power (VSP). The analysis result of tailpipe emissions and their relation to real world driving profile improved understanding of urban area nitrogen compound emissions, which will be useful for controlling of urban air quality...|$|E

40|$|Tightening {{emissions}} {{regulations are}} driving increasing focus on both equipment and measurement capabilities {{in the test}} cell environment. Customer expectations are therefore rising with respect to data uncertainty. Key critical test cell parameters such as load, fuel rate, air flow and emission measurements are more heavily under scrutiny and require real time methods of verification {{over and above the}} traditional test cell calibration in 1065 regulation. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a system to use a carbon dioxide (CO 2) based balance error and an oxygen (O 2) based balance error for diagnosing the main measurement system error in the test cell such as fuel rate meter, air flow meter, emission sample line, pressure transducer and thermocouples. The general combustion equation is used to set up the balance equations with assumptions. To validate the air fuel ratio balance model an experimental investigation was carried out for D 2 5 mode and C 1 8 mode cycle test. Once the test was carried out, the AFR_O 2 and the AFR_CO 2 were calculated in the developed analysis model with a pass/fail threshold of ± 3 %. Then the sensitivity response of measurement system such as <b>fuel</b> <b>meter,</b> air flow meter, pipe boost pressure, atmospheric pressure, CO 2 analyser and O 2 analyser were investigated.

40|$|A ship’s energy {{efficiency}} performance is generally estimated by conducting special sea trials of few hours under very controlled environmental conditions of calm sea, standard draft and optimum trim. This indicator is then {{used as the}} benchmark for future reference of the ship’s Energy Efficiency Performance (EEP). In practice, however, for greater part of operating life the ship operates in conditions which are far removed from original sea trial conditions and therefore comparing energy performance with benchmark performance indicator is not truly valid. In such situations a higher fuel consumption reading from the ship <b>fuel</b> <b>meter</b> {{may not be a}} true indicator of poor machinery performance or dirty underwater hull. Most likely, the reasons for higher fuel consumption may lie in factors other than the condition of hull and machinery, such as head wind, current, low load operations or incorrect trim [1]. Thus a better and more accurate approach to determine {{energy efficiency}} of the ship attributable only to main machinery and underwater hull condition will be to filter out the influence of all spurious and non-standard operating conditions from the ship’s fuel consumption [2]. The author in this paper identifies parameters of a suitable filter to be used on the daily report data of a typical LNG tanker of 33000 kW shaft power to remove effects of spurious and non-standard ship operations on its fuel consumption. The filtered daily report data has been then used to estimate actual fuel efficiency of the ship and compared with the sea trials benchmark performance. Results obtained using data filter show closer agreement with the benchmark EEP than obtained from the monthly mini trials. The data filtering method proposed in this paper has the advantage of using the actual operational data of the ship and thus saving cost of conducting special sea trials to estimate ship EEP. The agreement between estimated results and special sea trials EEP is expected to improve further with use of better and more accurate filtering techniques...|$|E
40|$|The {{tailpipe}} {{exhaust emissions}} were measured under real world {{urban driving conditions}} by using a EURO 4 emissions compliant SI car equipped with an on-board heated FTIR for speciated gaseous emission measurements, a differential GPS for travel profiles, thermocouples for temperatures, and a MAX <b>fuel</b> <b>meter</b> for transient fuel consumption. Emissions species were measured at 0. 5 Hz. The tests were designed to enable cold start to occur into congested traffic, typical of the situation of people living alongside congested roads into a large city. The cold start was monitored through temperature measurements of the TWC front and rear face temperatures and lubricating oil temperatures. The emissions are presented {{to the end of}} the cold start, defined when the downstream TWC face temperature is hotter than the front face which occurred at ~ 350 - 400 oC. Journeys at various times of the day were conducted to investigate traffic flow impacts on the cold start. The test route had traffic and pedestrian crossing lights, several major road junctions and a busy shopping area. The time aligned vehicle moving parameters with pollutant emission data and fuel consumption enabled the micro-analysis of correlations between these parameters. The average cold start emissions, fuel consumption and temperature data are presented for the journeys into different levels of congestion (based on the mean speed of the cold start journey). The mean complete journey speed during was shown to reasonably correlate the emissions, which increased as mean speed reduced. The cold start congested traffic portion was separately analysed to show the much higher emissions for equivalence mean speeds. Engine vehicle specific power (VSP) output was calculated and used together with the fuel flow to determine the instantaneous and average thermal efficiency. Three way catalysts (TWC) light off was approximately 200 seconds, much longer than for the NEDC test cycle. Currently urban air quality monitoring does not include cold start into congested traffic from vehicles at houses along the road, but does have procedures where cold start occur at large car parks...|$|E

40|$|This work {{introduces}} two new lost cost, electronically controlled <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> {{systems for}} small gas turbine engines, particularly applicable in remotely piloted vehicles. The first one incorporates a diaphragm operated flat-seat bypass valve {{to maintain a}} constant differential pressure across the metering valve, which is actuated by a digital linear actuator. In the second one, both the metering and the bypass valves are controlled by two independently operated digital linear actuators. The mathematical models for the first <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> system, were created and used for computer simulation. Next, after preparing the experimental test set-up, the manufactured prototype was tested and the models for both the steady state and the dynamic response were validated. Three design optimization criteria, fuel flow linearity, low sensitivity to the design parameters changes and fast dynamic response were examined to improve {{the performance of the}} proposed <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> system. Finally, a multi-objective optimization technique was developed and implemented to obtain the best design parameters of the system. For the second <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> system, first the mathematical models for both the steady state and dynamic response were developed. Next, due to the flexibility offered by this system, different control strategies for controlling the digital linear actuators during the normal operation mode of the actuators and also during the back-up operation modes were introduced and investigated. Finally, to investigate the impact of different control strategies on the dynamic response of the engine, a dynamic model for the engine was also developed and used. At the end, four available <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> systems, including the two new ones, were compared regarding their deviation from the fuel flow linearity, dynamic response and the cost...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{represents}} a major proportion of road transport expenditure {{and it is}} likely that this proportion will increase. At typical road speeds approximately half of the total fuel used is consumed in overcoming aerodynamic drag, hence the determination and reduction of aerodynamic drag is of considerable importance. This is normally performed by scale testing in wind tunnels with relatively smooth flow. When modelling an atmospheric crosswind in the tunnel the relative air direction is generated by yawing the model at an angle to the oncoming flow. This procedure does not reproduce the inherent turbulence in atmospheric winds. A review of the literature showed a poor correlation between road and wind-tunnel results often attributed to the lack of tunnel turbulence. The work presented herein involves road and wind-tunnel tests to investigate these discrepancies and aims to improve the accuracy of wind-tunnel modelling for commercial vehicles. Wind-tunnel and on-road tests which determine drag coefficient reductions from aerodynamic devices fitted to commercial vehicles are described. Two series of road tests utilised pairs of commercial vehicles: International Harvester Australia low-forward-entry articulated vehicles with maximum road-legal size containers and Isuzu rigid (box-van) vehicles fitted with cuboid containers. Drag coefficient reductions were calculated from <b>fuel</b> <b>meter</b> readings in the trucks and measurements of yaw angle and relative velocity from an instrumented chase car. Tunnel testing was performed on scale vehicles in the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) Industrial Wind Tunnel in relatively smooth flow (longitudinal intensity = 1. 7 %). Large differences between road and tunnel drag coefficients at high yaw angles were found. The on-road turbulent wind environment was measured utilising a vehcle instrumented with mast-mounted cross-wire and propeller-vane anemometers. Atmospheric mean wind speeds of 1 m/s to 9 m/s, aligned at various angles to. the road direction, were encountered and data were taken with the vehicle stationary and moving at 27. 8 m/s (100 km/h). Longitudinal and lateral intensities and spectra were calculated thus providing new information on the wind environment for vehicles. A mathematical model of the turbulence intensities perceived by a moving vehicle was developed. This utilised atmospheric wind data obtained whilst the vehicle was stationary to predict moving vehicle data. Measured and predicted intensities for the moving vehicle were in good agreement for roads with no local roadside obstructions (eg. trees) thus validating the model, but the obstructions increased data scatter and augmented the lateral intensities by typically 30 %) with little change in the longitudinal intensities. Peaks in the longitudinal and lateral spectra for the moving vehicle were at approximately 1. 0 Hz and most of the energy was contained between 0. 1 Hz and 10 Hz. Subsequent tunnel tests were performed using five levels of grid-generated turbulence and the mathematical model was used to predict the on-road data from tunnel tests. Better agreement was found at high yaw angles when the correct longitudinal intensities were used. However the scales of turbulence in the tunnel were too short for correct modelling. Flow visualisation studies over the model and full-size cab roofs indicated differences in flow patterns that were attributed to Reynolds number differences. The mathematical model and measurements described in this thesis showed that high yaw giigles are always accompanied by relatively high turbulence intensities and it was concluded that the modelling of turbulence characteristics for commercial vehicles is more important than other modelling parameters such as a moving ground. Most major vehicle aerodynamics tunnels have very low turbulence levels (longitudinal rms intensities commonly less than 0. 5 %) whereas measured on-road values of 2 % to 5 % are typical (with higher values of lateral intensities). It is therefore recommended that for vehicle aerodynamic generally more attention be paid to correctly modelling the intensities and scales of turbulence in wind tunnels and understanding the effects of typical turbulence characteristics on vehicle drag...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} find an empirical model of diesel engine transfer function for control purpose. With an assumption of linear diesel operation in a limited region, the linear theory was adopted. Since a smoke problem generally appears during unsteady operation, <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> rate was selected as an input variable. Binary input signals (pseudo-random binary sequence and multi-frequency binary sequence) were selected as input signals. Step input signal was also used for transient study of smoke production. The system identification method using binary signals was tested by computer simulation before applying it to the engine experiment;An engine control and monitoring package was developed using an 8088 based personal computer. This package included a host computer, a multipurpose interface board for signal processing, a <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> valve perturbing mechanism with a modified <b>fuel</b> <b>metering</b> pump, an in-line smoke opacity meter, and an operating software written in C and Assembly languages.
