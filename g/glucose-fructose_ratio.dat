40|$|In the oenological sector, the {{withering}} {{process is}} of particular importance {{in the production of}} dry and sweet dessert wines due to the total or partial use of overripe and/or dehydrated grapes. This complex process leads to several changes in the chemical-physical characteristics of white grape berries affecting the wine quality and, {{at the end of the}} dehydration period, different visual attributes are usually present in the berry skins. The aim of this work, therefore, was to study the properties of Erbaluce dried grapes of varying external colors, classified into three groups based on reflectance colorimetry (green, gold and blue). The chemical composition, volatile profile and mechanical attributes were investigated, focusing on establishing relationships between CIEL *. a *. b * parameters of dehydrated grapes and their chemical-physical characteristics. The higher values of the <b>glucose-fructose</b> <b>ratio,</b> together with the higher content of sugars, gluconic acid and glycerol, but lower titratable acidity, suggests the presence of. Botrytis cinerea Pers. infection in blue withered berries, which has been microbiologically confirmed. Regarding the instrumental mechanical properties, blue dehydrated grapes were characterized by a lower skin hardness and higher skin thickness in agreement with the higher weight loss experienced. Finally, the determination of free and bound volatile compounds showed that some of them were only found in blue withered berries, δ-lactones being considered the main chemical markers of the noble rot infection that are important for the odor character. C- 10 alkyl massoia lactone was the most abundant volatile compound in blue botrytized grapes...|$|E
40|$|During {{the adult}} stage many {{arthropod}} species, including aphid predators and parasitoids, depend on nectar and honeydew {{as a source}} of carbohydrates. Despite the importance of sugar feeding for these organisms, we know little about their energy and nutrient provision under field conditions. 2. Here we assessed the nutritional state of adult parasitoids, hoverflies and lacewings in a Swiss winter wheat (WW) and a spring wheat (SW) field and studied the contribution of honeydew to the diet of these aphidophagous insects. The total sugar level and the <b>glucose-fructose</b> <b>ratio</b> were used as indicators for nutritional state and sugar feeding. 3. Over 76 % of the collected individuals from each of the three insect groups in both fields had recently consumed carbohydrates. The average nutritional state was significantly higher in the SW field for Chrysoperla carnea and Aphidius spp. 4. Honeydew consumption by insects is commonly investigated by analyzing target insects for the presence of honeydew ‘signature’ sugars, such as melezitose and erlose. However, our laboratory studies show that adults of the three insect orders investigated synthesize these ‘honeydew-specific’ sugars after sucrose feeding. 5. As the erlose-melezitose ratio of sucrose-fed Aphidius spp. and the hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus differed clearly from the honeydew sugar profiles of wheat infesting aphids, this ratio could be used as an alternative indicator of honeydew feeding. However, this method could not be used for the lacewing C. carnea. 6. Our data show that 55 % (WW) and 59 % (SW) of field-collected Aphidius spp. which showed evidence of sugar feeding could be classified as having consumed honeydew within the 24 – 48 h before collection. Evidence of honeydew feeding by hoverflies, on the other hand, was found to be much more variable, ranging from 0 % in the WW field to 44 % in the SW field. 7. This study shows that the detection of honeydew consumption in field-collected insects based on honeydew oligosaccharides can be feasible even when insects synthesize these oligosaccharides themselves. ...|$|E
40|$|Commercial potting media often contain {{substantial}} {{amounts of}} peat that was mined from endangered bog and fen ecosystems. The main objectives {{of this study were}} to assess (1) whether the substitution of peat by vermicompost (VC) in potting substrate affects the emergence and biomass allocation of tomato seedlings (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) under greenhouse conditions and (2) whether VC amendments in seedling substrate affect tomato yields and fruit quality after plants were transplanted into equally fertilized field soil. Amended VC was produced of food and cotton waste in a windrow system by Eisenia fetida Sav [...] Vermicompost amendments significantly influenced, specifically for each tomato variety, emergence and biomass allocation (root:shoot ratio) of seedlings. Marketable yields of field tomatoes remained unaffected by VC amendments in seedling substrates. Peel firmness and <b>glucose-fructose</b> <b>ratios</b> of fruits were variety-specifically affected by VC amendments in seedling substrates. Results show that vermicompost could be an environmentally friendly substitute for peat in potting media with no detrimental effects on seedling performance and fruit quality.
