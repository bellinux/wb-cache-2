40|$|The paper exatines_the {{controversy}} {{over the use of}} Harold Rugg's textbooks in the social studies curriculum during the 1930 s and 40 s. The first section discusses the philosophy of social reconstruction maintaining that teachers and student's should-be in the forefront of social change. Rugg's major contribution to social reconstruction was a serious and sustained attempt to design a total curriculum. Section II presents Rugg's rationale for his approach, derived from the educational, social, political,,economici and aesthetic experiences he-had at Teachers College, Columbia. Two of Rugg's textbooks are analyzed in section III. "Changing Civilizations in the Modern World " employs narrative style and <b>extended</b> <b>quotations</b> to stress communality and interdependence among industrialized nations.

In general, <b>quotation</b> marks are <b>extended</b> to encompass as much speech as possible, including not just non-spoken text such as [...] "he said" [...] (as previously noted), but also as long as the conversion <b>extends.</b> The <b>quotation</b> marks end at the last spoken text, however, not extending to the end of paragraphs when the final part is not spoken.|$|R
500|$|Despite these {{positive}} reactions from the elite, Austen's novels received relatively few reviews during her lifetime: two for Sense and Sensibility, three for Pride and Prejudice, none for Mansfield Park, and seven for Emma. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. [...] They most often {{focused on the}} moral lessons of the novels. Moreover, as Brian Southam, who has edited the definitive volumes on Austen's reception, writes in his description of these reviewers, [...] "their job was merely to provide brief notices, <b>extended</b> with <b>quotations,</b> {{for the benefit of}} women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would like a book for its story, its characters and moral". This was not atypical critical treatment for novels in Austen's day.|$|R

5000|$|The {{backdrop}} {{of the film is}} the depiction of a despair bordering on self-loathing of much of the Italian electorate at Italian economic conditions and the austerity regimen imposed by the European Union. A [...] "Chancellor" [...] obviously intended to be Angela Merkel appears in the film without being named. While some have found the film somewhat lightweight, an <b>extended</b> <b>quotation</b> from Berthold Brecht placed in the mouth of the mad brother reveals the director's intent: when politicians and political institutions fail, only the spirit and individual efforts of the people can rescue a nation from crisis.|$|E

5000|$|Norman Finkelstein {{claimed that}} Peters' book was 'among the most {{spectacular}} frauds ever published on the Arab-Israeli conflict,' arguing that its substance was based on extensive plagiarization of a work by Ernst Frankenstein published in the 1940s. His 1984 review was based on his doctoral thesis, later expanded and published in Image and Reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict. Finkelstein went into a close examination of all of Peters' notes and sources, and argued that her work persistently misrepresented or distorted the primary documents. His systematic critique of the book, attacking the two major pillars of Peters' thesis, which he regarded as a 'threadbare hoax' supported by the 'American intellectual establishment', had a major impact of later reviews of the book, especially those in Great Britain. Firstly, {{in a number of}} lists, tables and examples Finkelstein juxtaposes the historical evidence Peters presents with <b>extended</b> <b>quotations</b> of the primary and secondary source material showing its original context. By doing so Finkelstein argues that the [...] "evidence that Peters adduces to document massive illegal Arab immigration into Palestine is almost entirely falsified." [...] For example, Peters cites the Hope Simpson Enquiry as having said that [...] "Egyptian labor is being employed" [...] in supporting her thesis of Arab immigration to Palestine. The actual Hope Simpson Report passage says [...] "Palestine Egyptian labor is being employed in certain individual cases ..." [...] In another instance, Peters cites the Anglo-American Survey of Palestine as having found that [...] "the 'boom' conditions in Palestine in the years 1934-1936 led to an inward movement into Palestine, particularly from Syria" [...] when, as Finkelstein demonstrates, the Survey, in the very next sentence, notes that [...] "The depression due to the state of public disorder during 1936-1939 led to the return of these people and also a substantial outward movement of Palestinian Arabs who thought it prudent to live for a time in the Lebanon and Syria." ...|$|R

5000|$|Liaison units flew [...] "...light {{single-engine}} liaison aircraft. Included {{were many}} enlisted aviation students who washed out of pilot training after having soloed and {{were given the}} opportunity to become Liaison Pilots. Flight training consisted of about 60 hours of flying time and stressed such procedures as short field landings and takeoffs over obstacles, low altitude navigation, first aid, day and night reconnaissance, aerial photography and aircraft maintenance. Unarmored and unarmed—except perhaps for a [...]45 pistol or [...]30 carbine—these men in 28 different squadrons flew low and slow with wheels, skis or floats. They flew varied and often hazardous missions in nearly every theater—medical evacuation from forward areas; delivering munitions, blood plasma, mail and other supplies to front lines; ferrying personnel; flying photographic or intelligence missions; serving as air observers for fighters or bombers; and other critical yet often unpublicized missions."During the campaign to recapture the Philippines, pilots of the 25th Liaison Squadron flew a dozen L-5 aircraft in short 30-minute flights (Dec. 10-25, 1944) delivering supplies (including a 300-bed hospital) to the 6,000 men of the 11th Airborne Division isolated in the mountains of Leyte."In another mission, an army officer wounded in the chest in New Guinea was evacuated in a liaison aircraft as the pilot pumped a portable respirator with one hand while he flew the aircraft with the other."In the northwestern United States, some liaison pilots flew forest patrols (Project Firefly), watching for fires ignited by incendiary bombs carried across the Pacific beneath unmanned Japanese high-altitude balloons."(Citation needed. <b>Extended</b> <b>quotation</b> by original contributor does not properly attribute citation).|$|E

500|$|Although {{avoiding}} {{stress on}} 12th century Scottish [...] "barbarity", the Lowland Scottish historians {{of the later}} Middle Ages tend to repeat the accounts of earlier chronicle tradition. Much that was written was either directly transcribed from the earlier medieval chronicles themselves or was modelled closely upon them, even in the significant works of John of Fordun, Andrew Wyntoun and Walter Bower. For example, Bower includes in his text the eulogy written for David by Ailred of Rievaulx. This <b>quotation</b> <b>extends</b> to over twenty pages in the modern edition, and exerted {{a great deal of}} influence over what became the traditional view of David in later works about Scottish history. Historical treatment of David developed in the writings of later Scottish historians, and the writings of men like John Mair, George Buchanan, Hector Boece, and Bishop John Leslie ensured that by the 18th century a picture of David as a pious, justice-loving state-builder and vigorous maintainer of Scottish independence had emerged.|$|R
5000|$|Gogarty {{remained}} a senator until {{the abolition of}} the Seanad in 1936, during which time he identified with none of the existing political parties and voted according to his own whims. He believed that Ireland should retain its dominion status in the British Commonwealth so as to [...] "keep with nations who understand that the first principle of freedom is a freedom that does not permit interference with the personal liberties of the citizen." [...] He supported rural electrification schemes, road improvement, reforestation and conservation, prevention of livestock cruelty, and educational reform. His views on controversial issues such as censorship and birth control were ambiguous; after expressing initial support for the Censorship Bill, he eventually went on to denounce it in scathing terms ("I think it is high time the men of this country found some other way of loving God than by hating women"), and while generally professing to oppose the sale of prophylactics, he voiced support for their usage in certain cases. He was most passionate on the subject of sanitation in schools and in urban and rural housing, about which he spoke frequently. His speeches frequently contained puns, wordplays, and <b>extended</b> poetic <b>quotations,</b> and were sometimes given in favour of facetious schemes, such as his attempt to have the phoenix statue in Phoenix Park included in the 1929 Wild Birds Protection Bill. [...] He was notoriously scornful of the government's attempts to reinstate the Irish language (which he referred to as [...] "Woolworth's Irish"), proposing that funding be used instead for housing and school health services, and remained perpetually suspicious of Éamon de Valera, against whose economic policies, character, and personal appearance he often hurled invectives during Seanad proceedings. De Valera eventually dissolved the Seanad when it persisted in obstructing Government proposals, effectively ending Gogarty's political career.|$|R
60|$|But mark another {{stage of}} the {{propagation}} of these horrible principles. After having grounded upon them the defence of his conduct against our charge, and after he had got a person to forswear them for him, and to prove him to have told falsehoods of the grossest kind to the House of Commons, he again adheres to this defence. The dog returned to his vomit. After having vomited out his vile, bilious stuff of arbitrary power, and afterwards denied it to be his, he gets his counsel in this place to resort to the loathsome mess again. They have thought proper, my Lords, to enter into an <b>extended</b> series of <b>quotations</b> from books of travellers, {{for the purpose of}} showing that despotism was the only principle of government acknowledged in India,--that the people have no laws, no rights, no property movable or immovable, no distinction of ranks, nor any sense of disgrace. After citing a long line of travellers to this effect, they quote Montesquieu as asserting the same facts, declaring that the people of India had no sense of honor, and were only sensible of the whip as far as it produced corporal pain. They then proceed to state that it was a government of misrule, productive of no happiness to the people, and that it so continued until subverted by the free government of Britain,--namely, the government that Mr. Hastings describes as having himself exercised there.|$|R

Kirkland said that as the bronze panels evolved, both veterans and DVLMF board members began questioning whether they effectively depicted the experiences of disabled veterans. It became clear that a more photo-realistic approach was needed, but this could only be accommodated by the glass panels. The designers realized that glass panels with only quotations was not dynamic enough, and that the bronze elements would help present the idealized elements that the photo-realistic images could not.|$|R
