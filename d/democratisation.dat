5|$|Weber listed several {{preconditions}} for {{the emergence}} of the bureaucracy: The growth in space and population being administered, the growth in complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out and the existence of a monetary economy– these resulted in a need for a more efficient administrative system. Development of communication and transportation technologies made more efficient administration possible (and popularly requested) and <b>democratisation</b> and rationalisation of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everybody equally.|$|E
5|$|In February 1956 Khrushchev denounced Stalin's cult of {{personality}} at the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party and {{embarked on a}} reform course. The de-Stalinization of official Soviet ideology left Poland's Stalinist hardliners in a difficult position. While unrest and desire for reform and change among both intellectuals and workers was beginning to surface throughout the Eastern Bloc, the death of Stalin's ally Bierut in March 1956 in Moscow (the veteran hardliner chief was attending the Soviet party's congress) exacerbated an existing split in the Polish party. In March Bierut was succeeded by Edward Ochab as first secretary. As the 20th Congress launched also a process of partial <b>democratisation</b> of Polish political and economic life, Ochab engaged in reforms intended to promote industrial decentralization and improve living standards.|$|E
5|$|<b>Democratisation</b> {{still left}} open one {{important}} {{distinction between the}} former princely states and the former British provinces, namely, that since the princely states had signed limited Instruments of Accession covering only three subjects, they were insulated from government policies in other areas. The Congress viewed this as hampering its ability to frame policies that brought about social justice and national development. Consequently, they sought to secure to the central government {{the same degree of}} powers over the former princely states as it had over the former British provinces. In May 1948, at the initiative of V. P. Menon, a meeting was held in Delhi between the Rajpramukhs of the princely unions and the States Department, {{at the end of which}} the Rajpramukhs signed new Instruments of Accession which gave the Government of India the power to pass laws in respect of all matters that fell within the seventh schedule of the Government of India Act 1935. Subsequently, each of the princely unions, as well as Mysore and Hyderabad, agreed to adopt the Constitution of India as the constitution of that state, thus ensuring that they were placed in exactly the same legal position vis-à-vis the central government as the former British provinces. The only exception was Kashmir, whose relationship with India continued to be governed by the original Instrument of Accession, and the constitution produced by the state's Constituent Assembly.|$|E
5|$|The {{order of}} {{precedence}} had been institutionalised, whereby Taraki was responsible for defence and Amin responsible for assisting Taraki in defence related matters. Amin's position was given a further blow by the <b>democratisation</b> of the decision-making process, which allowed its members to contribute; {{most of them were}} against Amin. Another problem for Amin was that the office of HHDC Deputy Chairman had no specific functions or powers, and the appointment of a new defence minister who opposed him drastically weakened his control over the Ministry of National Defence. The reorganisation of ministers was a further blow to Amin's position; he had lost control of the defence ministry, the interior ministry and the ASGA. Amin still had allies at the top, many of them in strategically important positions, for instance, Yaqub was his brother-in-law and the Security Chief in the Ministry of Interior was Sayed Daoud Taroon, who was also later appointed to the HHDC as an ordinary member in April. Amin succeeded in appointing two more of his allies to important positions; Mohammad Sediq Alemyar as Minister of Planning and Khayal Mohammad Katawazi as Minister of Information and Culture; and Faqir Mohammad Faqir was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in April 1978. Amin's political position was not secure when Alexei Yepishev, the Head of the Main Political Directorate of the Soviet Army and Navy, visited Kabul. Yepishev met personally with Taraki on 7 April, but never met with Amin. The Soviets were becoming increasingly worried about Amin's control over the Afghan military. Even so, during Yepishev's visit Amin's position was actually strengthened; Taroon was appointed Taraki's aide-de-camp.|$|E
25|$|The {{first party}} {{congress}} emphasized radical <b>democratisation</b> of Dutch {{society and the}} political system. Its ideal was a two-party system. To obtain this it wanted to reform the electoral system after the American first past the post model. The electoral reform was gradually moderated, now the party favours German-style mixed member proportional representation. In this system, a national party-list election is {{used to make a}} first-past-the-post election representative to the nationwide vote. This radical <b>democratisation</b> was combined with a pragmatic and anti-dogmatic attitude towards politics. Hans van Mierlo, the party's leader between 1966 and 1972 and between 1986 and 1998 and the party's figurehead, was an important exponent of this tendency within the party.|$|E
25|$|The strong {{attraction}} to the upper classes to the folkeskole gradually weakened. Since the conception {{of the welfare state}} was intensifying the demand for social equality and <b>democratisation,</b> middle schools were reorganised in 1958 to include two academic paths: a 3-year academically oriented real department and the 8th-10th forms.|$|E
25|$|On 25 April 1974, a {{group of}} low-ranking Portuguese {{officers}} organised a coup d'état, overthrowing the right-wing ruling government {{that had been in}} power for 48 years.

25|$|Gorbachev's {{policy of}} glasnost (literally openess) meant the gradual <b>democratisation</b> of the party. Because of this, {{the role of}} the Central Committee was strengthened.

The plan was to make the Central Committee an organ where discussion took place; and in this Gorbachev succeeded.|$|E

25|$|World War II {{brought a}} {{definitive}} reversal {{of this trend}} in western Europe. The <b>democratisation</b> of the American, British, and French sectors of occupied Germany (disputed), Austria, Italy, and the occupied Japan served {{as a model for}} the later theory of government change. However, most of Eastern Europe, including the Soviet sector of Germany fell into the non-democratic Soviet bloc.|$|E
25|$|Economic malaise in the 1980s, {{along with}} resentment of Soviet oppression, {{contributed to the}} {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, the associated end of the Cold War, and the <b>democratisation</b> and liberalisation of the former Eastern bloc countries. The most successful of the new democracies were those geographically and culturally closest to western Europe, and they are now members or candidate members of the European Union.|$|E
25|$|Hannibal {{became a}} {{businessman}} {{for several years}} and later enjoyed a leadership role in Carthage. However, the Carthaginian nobility, upset by his policy of <b>democratisation</b> and his struggle against corruption, persuaded the Romans to force him into exile in Asia Minor, where he again led armies against the Romans and their allies on the battlefield. He eventually committed suicide (ca. 182 BC) to avoid capture.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} wave of <b>democratisation</b> brought substantial gains toward true {{liberal democracy}} for many nations. Spain, Portugal (1974), {{and several of}} the military dictatorships in South America returned to civilian rule in the late 1970s and early 1980s (Argentina in 1983, Bolivia, Uruguay in 1984, Brazil in 1985, and Chile in the early 1990s). This was followed by nations in East and South Asia by the mid-to-late 1980s.|$|E
25|$|One of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) {{set by the}} UN {{includes}} environmental sustainability. In 2004, only 42% {{of people}} in rural areas had access to clean water.

25|$|In 1985, Mbeki was {{a member}} of a {{delegation}} that began meeting secretly with representatives of the South African business community, and in 1989, he led the ANC delegation that conducted secret talks with the South African government. These talks led to the unbanning of the ANC and the release of political prisoners. He also participated in many of the other important negotiations between the ANC and the government that eventually led to the <b>democratisation</b> of South Africa.|$|E
25|$|In July 2009, South Africa was {{hit with}} rolling protests by poor {{communities}} that demanded access to basic services, jobs, adequate housing and the <b>democratisation</b> of service delivery. These protests {{have been linked to}} the World Cup as protesters complain that public funds are being diverted away from social issues to build stadiums and upgrade airports. Fears have been expressed that the growing protests by shack dwellers could result in the tournament being disrupted. Some grassroots social movements have called for a boycott of the event.|$|E
25|$|A {{central theme}} {{in most of}} these tales is the {{difficulties}} of handling the new tolerance, open-mindedness and <b>democratisation</b> which are introduced by both the transition of society and by literature. Another theme is the conflict between the introverted and closed male nature and the vitality of the woman. Behind all this lies the classic naturalist theme of heritage and milieu against which man has to rebel without quite denying their existence. In his later works he sometimes seems to become a mixture of a castigator of society and a prophet of doom.|$|E
25|$|The party's {{principles}} {{reflect the}} ideological convergence between the four founding parties {{which came from}} different ideological traditions: the Political Party of Radicals and the Evangelical People's Party, from a progressive Christian tradition; and the Pacifist Socialist Party and the Communist Party of the Netherlands from the socialist and communist traditions. Over {{the course of the}} 1970s and 1980s, the parties had come to embrace environmentalism and feminism; they all favoured <b>democratisation</b> of society and had opposed the creation of new nuclear plants and the placement of new nuclear weapons in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the <b>democratisation</b> of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe had irreparably {{undermined}} {{the power of}} the CPSU and Gorbachev himself. The relaxation of censorship and attempts to create more political openness had the unintended effect of re-awakening long-suppressed nationalist and anti-Russian feelings in the Soviet republics. Calls for greater independence from Moscow's rule grew louder, especially in the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, which had been annexed into the Soviet Union by Joseph Stalin in 1940. Nationalist feeling also took hold in Georgia, Ukraine, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.|$|E
25|$|The end of World War II, began {{a period}} {{repudiation}} of pre-war Statism in Shōwa Japan {{to give way}} to post-war <b>democratisation.</b> The post-War Modernist architects who had been repressed by the Japanese architectural industry, became personal opponents of facism. There had not been an instance where modernism in Japanese architecture, had opposed Japanese fascism, however they opposed fascism by condemning the easily made association of Japan's postwar recovery and the Japonesque architecture of pre-war fascist Japan. Because the architects who had promoted Japonesque architecture had lost their political influence, they were unable to counter the argument that Japonesque architecture represented fascism.|$|E
25|$|After the Bohemian King Joseph II's {{reforms in}} the 1770s the {{university}} became increasingly state-directed, while today it is a public university. During the Revolution of 1848 university students and professors played a very active role {{on the side of}} <b>democratisation.</b> The conservative king Francis Joseph I closed most of its faculties during the 1850s, but they were reopened by an act of the Interim National Assembly passed on 21 February 1946. This act also extended the name from University of Olomouc to Palacký University, Olomouc, naming it for František Palacký, a 19th-century Moravian historian and politician.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish monarchs {{have been}} of the House of Bernadotte since 1818, based on the Swedish Act of Succession of 1810. The Constitution of 1809 assumed that the monarch would appoint his Cabinet as he saw fit, but growing calls for <b>democratisation</b> during {{the end of the}} 19th century made such an idea {{impossible}} to sustain. 1917 marks the end of any real political power for the Swedish monarch. The Constitution of 1974 codifies this development by removing all decision-making powers from the monarch, making it both de facto and de jure a ceremonial position, and today the Government has the chief executive power, not the king.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} of the human security discourse {{was the product of}} a convergence of factors {{at the end of the}} Cold War. These challenged the dominance of the neorealist paradigm’s focus on states, “mutually assured destruction” and military security and briefly enabled a broader concept of security to emerge. The increasingly rapid pace of globalisation; the failure of liberal state building through the instruments of the Washington Consensus; the reduced threat of nuclear war between the superpowers, the exponential rise in the spread and consolidation of <b>democratisation</b> and international human rights norms opened a space in which both ‘development’ and concepts of ‘security’ could be reconsidered.|$|E
25|$|He wielded great {{political}} authority {{and influence in}} Tonga's essentially aristocratic system of government, together with the country's nobles, who control 70% of the Legislative Assembly of Tonga. His involvement in an investment scandal, however, involving his appointed court jester Jesse Bogdonoff, had in his last years embroiled the King in controversy, and led to calls for greater government transparency and <b>democratisation.</b> In 2005, the government spent several weeks negotiating with striking civil service workers before reaching a settlement. The king's nephew, Tuʻi Pelehake (ʻUluvalu), served as mediator. A constitutional commission presented a series of recommendations for constitutional reform to the King {{a few weeks before}} his death.|$|E
25|$|Free {{movement}} of people across the EU will give many Turkish people the opportunity to easily migrate {{to other parts of}} Europe in search of work, or a higher standard of living. The option of migration out of Turkey will inevitably ease tensions in the east of the country, as the prospect of a better standard of living will tend to cool separatist tendencies. Some secularists in Turkey envisage that the accession of Turkey will contribute to the spread of secular western values in Turkey. Conversely, some non-secularists in Turkey envisage that accession will contribute to the further growth and acceptance of Islam in Europe. The EU accession bid has stimulated Turkey's political and legal reforms and intensified the <b>democratisation</b> process.|$|E
25|$|Democrats 66 {{was founded}} on 14 October 1966 by 44 people. Its founders were {{described}} as homines novi, although 25 of the 44 had previously been members of a political party. The initiators were Hans van Mierlo, a journalist for the Algemeen Handelsblad and Hans Gruijters, a municipal councillor in Amsterdam. Van Mierlo became the party's political leader and Gruijters the party's chair. The foundation of the party was preceded by the Appeal 1966 on October 10, in which the founders appealed {{to the people of}} the Netherlands to re-take their democratic institutions. The party renounced the 19th-century political ideologies, which dominated the political system and wanted to end pillarisation. It called for radical <b>democratisation</b> of the Dutch society and its political system and it called for pragmatic and scientific policy-making.|$|E
25|$|However, its {{relationship}} to the European Union and its institutions has changed dramatically and is still the subject of a lively debate. In the 1970s and 1980s the European Greens were generally sceptical of European political and economic integration, which was seen as contrary to environmental and social interests. In its 1984 program, the European Greens advocated the formation of an alternative Europe, which would be neutral and decentralised. In 1989, some member parties adopted a more parliamentary course and became more supportive of European integration. The program advocates the <b>democratisation</b> of Europe's institutions. In their 1994 program, the Greens abandoned their principled opposition of European integration and began to propose pragmatic alternatives for the European Union's policies and institutions. The 1999 and 2004 programs also reflect this.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{came out}} of the revolution as essentially bilingual (Czech and German) institution. In due course the university's support for the <b>democratisation</b> and the Czech National Revival brought retribution from the government in Vienna. In 1851, as the régime regained self-confidence, growing government intolerance of dissent and the subsequent decline in student numbers led to the closure of the Faculty of Philosophy. The Faculty of Law, which in 1849 had actually started teaching in the Czech language, was closed {{at the start of the}} 1855/56 academic year. In 1860 Emperor Franz Joseph I closed virtually the whole university. Only the independent Faculty of Theology and the independent University Library remained open, for nearly another eighty years, until, following the German invasion, all the Czech Universities were closed in November 1939. The School of Surgery also survived the emperor's decree in 1860, but closed in 1875.|$|E
25|$|With the {{security}} situation in Somalia improved, the Danish Foreign Ministry launched its new development policy in 2011 based on active diplomacy, security, governance, living standards, growth and employment. Within this official framework, the Danish government engaged Somalia's constituent autonomous regions, including Puntland, Somaliland and South Central Somalia, through the Interpeace programmes on <b>democratisation,</b> peace and women's engagement. It also established and funded the Somaliland Fund for the Somaliland regional administration's key areas. Additionally, local governance accountability and transparency were supported through JPLG, as well as gender equality via the UNDP. In terms of growth and employment, Denmark supported enabling business sector environment and fisheries and gums/resins value chains via the World Bank PSD programme in Puntland and Somaliland. It likewise supported marketing and institutional development through Terra Nuova in both regions' livestock sectors. To strengthen living standards, the Danish authorities also engaged in humanitarian support through the CHF and NGOs. In total, the development budget for 2011-14 was DKK 364 million, with DKK 20 million reserved for peace initiatives in Somalia.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly emancipated German-speaking Jews {{wanted to}} immerse {{themselves}} in Germany's rich cultural life. However, individual Jews {{were faced with}} a dilemma: they faced new opportunities, but without the comfort of a secure community. For Jewish women, there was an additional issue. German society imposed the usual gender role restrictions and antisemitism, so cultivated Jewish women tapped into the cultural salon. But from 1800 on, salons performed a political and social miracle. The salon allowed Jewish women to establish a venue in their homes in which Jews and non-Jews could meet in relative equality. Like-minded people could study art, literature, philosophy or music together. This handful of educated, acculturated Jewish women could escape the restrictions of their social ghetto. Naturally the women {{had to be in}} well-connected families, either to money or to culture. In these mixed gatherings of nobles, high civil servants, writers, philosophers and artists, Jewish salonnières created a radical vehicle for <b>democratisation,</b> providing a context in which patrons and artists freely exchanged ideas. Henriette Lemos Herz, Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, Dorothea Mendelssohn Schlegel, Amalie Wolf Beer and at least twelve other salonnières achieved fame and admiration.|$|E

25|$|Discontented {{with the}} {{hereditary}} system of allocating posts, {{the decline of}} the Dutch East India Company's Asian trade, unemployment in the textile industry and the desire of <b>democratisation,</b> the middle and upper classes looked towards the American Revolution and its Declaration of Independence and the Dutch Act of Abjuration and began to reclaim their rights (first written down in the 1579 Union of Utrecht). The lower classes largely remained supportive of the existing Orange stadtholderian regime, which supported the British Empire against the American rebels. 1780 is generally regarded as the outbreak of the major conflict between Patriots and Orangists, when their opposing policies on the American War of Independence stirred up domestic conflict. When the Republic threatened to join the First League of Armed Neutrality to defend its right to trade with the American colonies in revolt, Britain declared war: the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780–1784). The Patriots seized the occasion to try and rid themselves from Orange altogether, and allied themselves with the American republican revolutionaries. This was most clearly expressed in the 1781 pamphlet Aan het Volk van Nederland ("To the People of the Netherlands"), anonymously distributed by Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol. Partly thanks to his influence in the States General, the Netherlands became the second country to officially recognise the young American Republic in 1782. Between 1782 and 1787, democratic Patriotism managed to establish itself in parts of the Republic. From 1783 onwards, the Patriots formed militia or paramilitary groups called exercitiegenootschappen or vrijcorpsen. They tried to persuade the prince and city governments to allow non-Calvinists into the vroedschap. In 1784, they held their first national meeting. The total number of Patriot volunteer militiamen is estimated to have been around 28,000.|$|E
