As {{a result of the}} disagreement over the transfer, in December 2008, Ben Arfa told the local Lyon newspaper Le Progrès that his former team lacked class and was not a <b>great</b> <b>team.</b> Ben Arfa was presented to the media and had his first training session with the club the same day. He was given the number 20 shirt. On 16 July, Ben Arfa was involved in another training session bust-up, this time with striker and France international Djibril Cissé. Cissé later joined English club Sunderland on loan.|$|E
5|$|In the 1969–70 FA Cup quarter final, Liverpool {{played against}} {{struggling}} Second Division side Watford at Vicarage Road and lost 1–0 {{after a very}} poor performance. The Liverpool site records that the defeat signalled the end for St John, Hunt, Byrne, Yeats and Lawrence; the incomers included Ray Clemence, Alec Lindsay, Larry Lloyd, John Toshack, Brian Hall and Steve Heighway. Apart from Hall who graduated through the reserves, they were all signed from clubs in lower divisions or even, {{in the case of}} Heighway, from non-league football.

The {{next few years}} were erratic but {{gradually}} a <b>great</b> <b>team</b> came together. 4th place in 1954/55 was followed by 1st in 1955/56.

Cromar played in every league game, as did goalkeeper Frank Crampsey (brother of journalist and Queen's fan Bob), who kept 17 clean sheets. Queen's only lasted two seasons in the top Division and were relegated in 1958, having only won 4 league games all season, and losing heavily on many occasions.|$|E

25|$|VanDerveer was {{determined}} to play basketball in college. Her first choice was Mount Holyoke, but as one of five children, it wasn't financially possible for her to attend Mount Holyoke, so she chose Albany where her father had studied for his doctorate. It wasn't a <b>great</b> <b>team,</b> but she knew the coach, which helped with the decision. The team turned out not be challenging enough. Although naturally a guard, she jumped center, and lead the team in many categories, despite being the freshman on the team. She decided she needed a bigger challenge so she talked some of her friends into attending the AIAW National Championship, where she watched many teams, took notes, and decided where she wanted to go. She chose Indiana where she transferred and spent three years, making the Dean's List {{each of the three}} years. In her sophomore year, 1973 she helped the team reach the Final Four of the AIAW championship, losing in the semi-finals to Queens College.|$|E
25|$|A <b>great</b> <b>team</b> effort, despite Martin Bicknell {{being out}} of form, {{resulted}} in Surrey winning their third {{game of the season}} and sharing third place in the table with Hampshire. A healthy opening partnership between Scott Newman and Richard Clinton worth 100 was to be the highest of the entire match, and despite Chris Tremlett taking wickets regularly, he also conceded a lot of runs, as he ended with four for 106 off twenty overs. Newman eventually finished with 111 and Australian David Thornely made 73 to see Surrey to a final score of 361 - in just 81.4 overs. The first two days at The Rose Bowl were hampered by rain, but amid the showers, Indian bowler Harbhajan Singh took six for 36 as Hampshire crumbled in a rather unimpressive heap for 146. Only two batsmen passed 20, and seven were out in single figures. Hampshire's second innings began with the first ball of the third day, and Jason Ormond ripped out two wickets quickly, Mohammad Akram got a five-for, and only John Crawley's 67 - off 62 balls with thirteen boundaries, slightly out of place in the situation - passed 25. Thus, the two teams were tied on 100 points in the Championship, allowing Warwickshire and Kent to run away further on the table.|$|E
