40|$|Introduction - In {{the recent}} years, the {{province}} of Ferrara, in the Italian Northeast has been characterized by the phenomenon of massive immigration. The aim was to study hospital admissions related to the immigrant female population and its implications. Materials and Methods - The Local Healthcare Unit of the National Health Service provided data related to hospital admissions between 01 / 01 / 2006 to 31 / 12 / 2006. Results and Conclusions - On 53699 admissions of female subjects, 2656 were related to immigrants. A total of 1509 admissions were obstetrical or gynecological hospitalizations. The high number of DRGs representative of spontaneous abortions and voluntary <b>interruptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> may be an expression of social problem of some sections of the immigrant people community. The dissemination {{of information on the}} existence of social assistance programs is important. This can prevent the occurrence of critical health situations, especially during pregnancy and childbirth...|$|R

In a letter to his wife, Lejeune wrote [...] "today, I lost my Nobel prize in Medicine". More likely, Lejeune's denial of the contribution of Marthe Gautier and Raymond Turpin to the discovery of trisomy 21 may have been more decisive for the Noble committee to avoid a contested laureate.|$|E

This law legalizes {{the practice of}} abortion during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. The law came into force on 5 July 2010. The previous regulation —Organic Law 9/1985— decriminalized abortion on several points. The conservative People's Party in June 2010 filed an action against several provisions of law to the Constitutional Court, which {{has not yet been}} pronounced.

40|$|Behrman & Greep (1974) {{demonstrated}} that the human placenta at term is very rich in enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) metabolism. Our previous investigations (Falkay & Sas, 1976) showed that even the early human placenta inactivates PG very rapidly and that the major site of metabolism in the foetal-placental unit is the placenta. It is possible that PG metabolism by the placenta stops the development of spontaneous uterine contractions. Carminati, Luzziani, Soffientini & Lerner (1975) investigated 15 a-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15 -OH-PGDH) activity in the rat placenta during pregnancy and observed {{a significant relationship between}} the day <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and PG synthesis and metabolism. The investigations of Alam, Rüssel & Moulton (1976) in the rat also suggest that 15 -OH-PGDH activity is under hormonal control.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A future {{prospect}} {{was carried}} out of the professional trends regarding prescription, counseling and practice <b>of</b> voluntary <b>interruptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> (VIP). METHODS: To this end, a questionnaire was administered to 177 last term students of the Valencia and Alicante Schools of Medicine regarding {{the opinions of the}} current law on VIP in Spain and the professional trends of approach, with practical examples of the four instances depenalized by the Spanish law. RESULTS: For 44 % of the sample the present law is insufficient, 30 % agree with it and 13 % think that the present law threatens life. The instance which elicited a highest number of favorable professional trends was congenital malformation (85 %), followed by physical problems (78 %) and psychical problems (63 %). Only 60 % of students would take a favorable attitude in case of rape. The students without religious practice, who vote progressive political parties and who think that present law is insufficient have a significant tendency towards attitudes favoring VIP. Significant sex differences among students were not found. CONCLUSIONS: Although probably to a lesser degree than in the present, in the near future the unfavorable attitudes of physicians will continue hindering the access of women to the services of VIP. A wide debate and more studies are required for a better definition of the implications of this phenomenon for public health purposes...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} ductus venosus Doppler findings {{on the day of}} delivery and postnatal outcomes in pregnancies with absent or reversed end-diastolic (ARED) flow in the umbilical arteries. Study design: Postnatal outcomes of 103 newborns <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> with a diagnosis of ARED flow on Doppler velocimetry of the umbilical arteries were analyzed retrospectively between January 1997 and December 2004. Single pregnancies and fetuses without malformations were included. The cases were divided into two groups according to the flow during atrial contraction (a-wave) in the ductus venosus on the day of delivery: group A, 20 cases with absent or reversed flow in the ductus venosus and group B, 83 cases with positive flow. The results were analyzed statistically using the chi-square test, Fisher`s exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test with the level of significance set at 5 %. Results: All newborns were delivered by cesarean section. Gestational age was similar in the two groups (group A: 30 weeks and group B: 30. 9 weeks, P = 0. 23). Absent or reversed ductus venosus flow was associated with the following adverse postnatal outcomes: lower birthweight (P < 0. 001), lower Apgar scores in the first (P = 0. 001) and fifth minute (P = 0. 001), a higher frequency of orotracheal intubation (P = 0. 001) and pH at birth less than 7. 20 (P < 0. 001), pulmonary hemorrhage (P = 0. 03), thrombocytopenia (P = 0. 02), hypoglycemia (P = 0. 01), intracranial hemorrhage (P = 0. 02), and postnatal death (P = 0. 007). Conclusion: The study of ductus venosus flow may provide additional information regarding the best time for <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> with ARED flow in the umbilical arteries characterized by extreme prematurity.
