40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} simple {{framework}} for solving different ill-posed inverse problems in image processing {{by means of}} constrained total variation minimizations. We argue that drawbacks commonly attributed to total variation algorithms (slowness and incomplete fit to the image model) can be easily bypassed by performing only a few number of iterations in our optimization process. We illustrate this approach {{in the context of}} computerized tomography, that comes down to inverse a Radon transform obtained by illuminating an object by straight and parallel beams of x-rays. This problem is ill-posed because only a finite number of line integrals can be measured, resulting in an incomplete coverage of the frequency plane and requiring, for a direct Fourier reconstruction, frequencies interpolation from a polar to a Cartesian grid. We introduce a new method of interpolation based on a total variation minimization constrained by the knowledge of frequency coefficients in the polar <b>grid,</b> <b>subject</b> to a Lipschitz regularity assumption.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{deployment of}} distributed generation (DG) such as photovoltaic panels (PV) connected to low-voltage (LV) grids {{is becoming a}} common trend in urban areas. The advances of information and communication technology (ICT) facilitates the collaborative operation of DG systems to achieve collective benefits. The fusion of these two trends creates a new scenario where reactive power control methods can offer additional features and benefits beyond the conventional voltage regulation provided by the droop method. Taking advantage of this new scenario, this paper formulates the application of reactive power control as an optimization problem where simple and ideal settings are imposed by design {{in order to facilitate}} the exploration search as well as to avoid over-constraining the optimization space. By appropriately using the reactive power capacity of inverters, the desired collective benefit is to minimize power losses while individual voltages at each inverter should be kept within the statutory limits.

40|$|Abstract—We study {{competitive}} online algorithms for EV (electrical vehicle) charging {{under the}} scenario of an aggregator serving {{a large number}} of EVs together with its background load, using both its own renewable energy (for free) and the energy procured from the external grid. The goal of the aggregator is to minimize its peak procurement from the <b>grid,</b> <b>subject</b> to the constraint that each EV has to be fully charged before its deadline. Further, the aggregator can predict the future demand and the renewable energy supply with some levels of uncertainty. The key challenge here is how to develop a model that captures the prior knowledge from such prediction, and how to best utilize this prior knowledge to reduce the peak under future uncertainty. In this paper, we first propose a 2 -level increasing precision model (2 -IPM), to capture the system uncertainty. We develop a powerful computation approach that can compute the optimal competitive ratio under 2 -IPM over any online algorithm, and also online algorithms that can achieve the optimal competitive ratio. A dilemma for online algorithm design is that an online algorithm with good competitive ratio may exhibit poor average-case performance. We then propose a new Algorithm-Robustification procedure that can convert an online algorithm with reasonable average-case performance to one with both the optimal competitive ratio and good average-case performance. The robustified version of a well-known heuristic algorithm, Receding Horizon Control (RHC), is found to demonstrate superior performance via trace-based simulations. I...|$|E
40|$|The atmospheres of novae at early {{times in}} their outbursts are very extended, {{expanding}} shells with low densities. Models of these atmospheres show that NLTE effects {{are very important}} and must be included in realistic calculations. We have, therefore, been improving our atmospheric studies by {{increasing the number of}} ions treated in NLTE. One of the most important ions is Fe II which has a complex structure and numerous lines in the observable spectrum. In this paper we investigate NLTE effects for Fe II {{for a wide variety of}} parameters. We use a detailed Fe II model atom with 617 level and 13675 primary lines, treated – 2 – using a rate-operator formalism. We show that the radiative transfer equation in nova atmospheres must be treated with sophisticated numerical methods and that simple approximations, such as the Sobolev method, cannot be used because of the large number of overlapping lines in the co-moving frame. Our results show that the formation of the Fe II lines is strongly affected by NLTE effects. For low effective temperatures, Teff < 20, 000 K, the optical Fe II lines are most influenced by NLTE effects, while for higher Teff the UV lines of Fe II are very strongly affected by NLTE. The departure coefficients are such that Fe II tends to be overionized in NLTE when compared to LTE. Therefore, Fe II-NLTE must be included with sophisticated radiative transfer in nova atmosphere models in order to reliably analyze observed nova spectra. Finally, we show that the number of wavelength points required for the Fe II NLTE model atmosphere calculations can be reduced from 90, 000 to about 30, 000 without changing the results if we choose a sufficiently dense UV wavelength <b>grid.</b> <b>Subject</b> headings: stellar atmospheres, novae, radiative transfer, NLT...|$|E
