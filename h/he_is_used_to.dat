The majority of B-47 scenes were filmed at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, using aircraft from the 306th Bombardment Wing.|$|E
25|$|In (36a), {{the empty}} pronoun ø {{is able to}} refer to any entity. However, the {{preferred}} reading is {{for it to be}} interpreted as a variable bound to the quantifier mei ge ren (or everyone). In contrast, the ta (he) in sentence (36b) is unable to have a bound variable interpretation, and must be interpreted as referring to some other third party. Huang states that this is because the empty pronoun construction (36a) is possible, and so it is preferred as the construction that carries the bound variable interpretation. This explanation is made as an extension of a claim put forward by Chomsky in his theory of anaphora, which states that where empty pronouns and overt pronouns are both able {{to be used as a}} reference, languages will prefer to use the empty pronoun. This implies that, since English does not have an empty pronoun available in the above examples, the overt pronoun <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> refer to the quantifier everybody. However, since the empty pronoun is available in Mandarin, using it is preferred when the pronoun in the sentence is meant to corefer with everybody, as in (36a).|$|E

500|$|For To, filming Vengeance {{differed}} from his usual style of filmmaking. [...] While <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> improvising his scenes as a director, Vengeance {{marked the first}} time that To had to work with a complete shooting script since the producers demanded that the story and dialogue already be written. Hallyday was the only actor to have read the script, while Anthony Wong had knowledge of the story. To explained that his purpose was to [...] "keep the actors natural and spontaneous. They don't have time to create something. They're given a situation and they act it right away." [...] After filming was complete, the cast and crew celebrated by having a final dinner at a restaurant located near the Milkyway Image studio, hoping to meet again at the forthcoming Cannes Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|... "The Natural Order" [...] is one {{of several}} 30 Rock episodes to deal with race. In this episode, when Tracy leaves the first {{rehearsal}} accusing Liz of racism he shouts [...] "race card!" [...] and hands Liz a card with [...] "race card" [...] written on it ("playing the race card" [...] is an expression that means introducing the issue of race into an argument in order to gain the upper hand). During their disagreement Tracy also says that [...] "we have a black president now", referring to Barack Obama, but Liz says that he voted for Ralph Nader. According to J. Jeremy Wisnewski in [...] "Race At The Rock: Race Cards, White Myths, And Postracial America", this plotline is an example of people [...] "want to have race and do away with it too." [...] Tracy wants to be treated equally but also wants to continue behaving the way <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to.</b> Wisnewski says {{that by the end of}} the episode, Liz and Tracy, in reverting to [...] "the natural order", have come to understand the concept of equality; rather than forcing people [...] "to be equivalent to one another ... considering the different interests of people equally." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also, in many variant Hebrew pronunciations {{the letter}} may {{represent}} a glottal stop.

30|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation of}} these results is that the clinician tended to assess images of the quality that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> viewing as adequate and images with fewer counts than <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> as less than adequate. This might also explain why no scans were identified as have image quality more than adequate. It might be useful to check that the clinician’s assessment of image quality coincided with the lesion detectability.|$|R

2500|$|Chelsea {{had fired}} manager Claudio Ranieri before UEFA Euro 2004, and Grønkjær signed for Birmingham City for £2.2million in July 2004. He had a poor start with Birmingham; manager Steve Bruce {{attributed}} this to difficulty adapting to {{playing in a}} struggling team, as [...] "he is used to his team dominating the opposition and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the ball more often". He scored only once, against Lincoln City in the Football League Cup. He was transferred to Atlético Madrid in December 2004, for a fee of around €2million. Grønkjær struggled to settle in Spain and, following putting in a transfer request, made a reported €6 million move to Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart {{in the summer of}} 2005, where the club was building a formidable squad under manager Giovanni Trapattoni and Grønkjær would play alongside fellow Dane Jon Dahl Tomasson.|$|E
2500|$|A {{regular on}} British radio and television, {{he has been}} {{described}} as [...] "a formidable interview subject, with a hostility simmering just beneath the surface – perhaps because, in his words, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> having to 'hit hard' whenever he is given the chance to air his unfashionable views." [...] In 2011, Hitchens was booed by the audience for a Question Time programme, on which he appears regularly, when he said that the expansion of sex education had been followed by increased numbers of teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. During the same programme, chairman David Dimbleby quoted to Hitchens comments made by John Bercow that The Mail on Sunday was [...] "a bigoted, sexist, homophobic comic strip." [...] After his appearance, Hitchens wrote [...] "Is there any point in public debate in a society where hardly anyone has been taught how to think, while millions have been taught what to think?" [...] Hitchens is also heard on Any Questions?, This Week, The Daily Politics and The Big Questions.|$|E
