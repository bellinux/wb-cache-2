It hurled him under it, prostrate on the <b>foundation</b> <b>arch</b> which had been his support; crushed and dislocated his right shoulder; and shivered his lantern into fragments. A groan of irrepressible anguish burst from his lips. He was left in impenetrable darkness.|$|E

50|$|When completed, its {{tremendous}} mass rose on huge brick <b>foundation</b> <b>arches</b> over {{twelve feet}} above the surrounding earth, its walls and mantels were plastered and carved by the most expert European craftsmen money could secure, its great flight of brick steps was covered with imported marble, its door knobs and keyhole guards were of silver, its pillars bore Corinthian capitals six feet high but of the utmost refinement. Its theatrical magnificence would have delighted the Bibiena family - seventeenth century designers of the most elaborate and grandiose stage sets for kings. Yet it was not heavy, or pompous. It managed somehow, to combine vastness with delicacy; titanic proportions with grace and warmth....|$|R

60|$|Immediately {{over his}} head, the {{material}} of {{the interior of the}} wall presented a smooth, flat, hard surface, which seemed capable of resisting the most vigorous attempts at its destruction; but on looking round, he perceived at one side of him and further inwards, an appearance of dark, dimly-defined irregularity, which promised encouragingly for his intended efforts. He descended into the chasm of the rivulet, crawled up on a heap of crumbling brick-work, and gained a hole above it, which he immediately began to widen, to admit of his passage through. Inch by inch, he enlarged the rift, crept into it, and found himself on a fragment of the bow of one of the <b>foundation</b> <b>arches,</b> which, though partly destroyed, still supported itself, isolated from all connection with the part of the upper wall which it had once sustained, and which had gradually crumbled away into the cavities below.|$|R

50|$|New Andreyevsky Road Bridge (Aндреевский автодорожный мост) was {{completed}} in December 2000. Design challenge included merging the bridge with the tunnel system under Gagarin Square.

50|$|The large <b>arch</b> <b>foundations</b> {{still exist}} but {{the bridge was}} never rebuilt.Instead the Tjörn Bridge, a new {{cable-stayed}} bridge, was constructed in 17 months and inaugurated the following year.

25|$|In {{the cellar}} is the boiler room which was {{originally}} {{one of the}} kitchens, having {{the remains of a}} fireplace and of a Belfast sink. At least two of the rooms at this level, including the present boiler room, are the remaining cellars of the original 17th-century house. They are part of the old <b>foundations,</b> having <b>arched</b> ceilings and supporting walls. At least one other cellar room has a 19th-century flat ceiling made of wooden joists and laths, showing that the room is part of Barber's 1871 extension.|$|R

40|$|The {{ground floor}} {{includes}} the vestibule, lecture hall, and auxiliary rooms. Intermediate floor levels {{are devoted to}} office space. At the lowest level there is an observation room, {{for the benefit of}} those who wish to view the atomic power station, but are not allowed to go in it. From the observation room visitors have {{a good view of the}} station, and also with the aid of models, they can learn the methods of operation of the equipment. The total floor area of the suspended building is 1, 000 m 2. With the exception of the <b>foundations,</b> <b>arches,</b> tie members, basement and lift shaft, the building has been made in lightweight prestressed concrete. This has provided an excellent sound insulation and a large saving in weight, as well as a pleasant slenderness of outline. Su planta baja comprende: el hall, sala de conferencias, salas auxiliares, etc. Las plantas intermedias albergan las oficinas. En el nivel inferior hay un pabellón-mirador —destinado para aquellos que quieren verla y no tienen permiso para visitarla desde el cual los visitantes pueden contemplar la totalidad de las instalaciones y, además, mediante maquetas y diapositivas llegar a conocer el funcionamiento de esta Central de energía atómica. La superficie total del edificio es de 1. 000 m 2. Con la excepción de los cimientos, arcos, tirantes, sótano y foso del ascensor, el resto del edificio ha sido construido a base de hormigón ligero —pretensado—, con lo que se ha conseguido un óptimo aislamiento térmico, una notable disminución de peso y una ele gante esbeltez general...|$|R

5|$|Reconstruction of {{the arch}} began on 1 August 2014, but work stopped soon {{afterwards}} after {{part of the}} original <b>arch's</b> <b>foundations</b> was found. Reconstruction continued in January 2015, and it was complete by the end of November 2015. Some finishing touches were made in February 2016, including the installation of two marble plaques. The arch was inaugurated on 28 April 2016 by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and mayor of Birkirkara Joanne Debono Grech.|$|R
50|$|Further {{issues are}} the {{foundations}} for the bridge. Arch bridges generate large side thrusts on their footings and so may require a solid bedrock <b>foundation.</b> Flattening the <b>arch</b> shape to avoid the humpback problem, such as for Brunel's Maidenhead bridge, increases this side thrust. It is often impossible to achieve a flat enough arch, simply owing to {{the limitations of the}} foundations - particularly in flat country. Historically, such bridges often became viaducts of multiple small arches.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{being located}} outside Kyustendil at the time, {{up until the}} {{construction}} of the city's main Bulgarian National Revival-style church in 1816, the Church of St George served as Kyustendil's cathedral. The church suffered some severe damage during the 19th century, the time of the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria; it was mostly destroyed, leaving only the <b>foundations</b> of the <b>arches.</b> It was reconstructed in 1878–1880, just after the establishment of the Principality of Bulgaria, with further restoration in the 2000s.|$|R

50|$|The Heard-Lakeman House is a {{historic}} house at 2 Turkey Shore Road in Ipswich, Massachusetts. Nathaniel and John Heard built this 2.5 story wood frame house in 1776 for Nathaniel to live in. He sold it in 1795 to Richard Lakeman III, member of a seafaring family. The house is notable for an extremely large chimney with an <b>arched</b> <b>foundation</b> over 11 ft long, which supports two large fireplaces. The building was a notable object of restoration during the Colonial Revival in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{scrapping}} {{the steel}} arch of the 1907 Andreyevsky Rail Bridge, city planners re-used it as a structural core {{for the new}} pedestrian bridge. May 22, 1999, three barges towed the steel frame to the new anchorage, 1.5 kilometre downstream. By this time, contractors already set up concrete <b>foundations,</b> pillars and <b>arches</b> at the new site; they were finished with granite slabs salvaged from the old site. Moskva river {{at this point is}} wider than at St.Andrew’s, so four pillars and three 25-meter arches over water were required to close the gaps.|$|R
