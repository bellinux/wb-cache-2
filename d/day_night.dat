25|$|Early spring can {{be quite}} cold, and {{occasionally}} the lowest temperatures of the year can occur in March, as it did at Heathrow Airport on 5 March 2001, 4 March 2006 and 8 March 2011. Temperatures below freezing are not unusual in March, even {{in the south of}} the UK. On the other hand, high temperatures above 30°C are generally rare but can occur on occasion; most recently on 25 May 2012. It was even hotter on 27 May 2005, when 31.9°C was recorded in London. Rarely, the hottest day of the year can be in spring. As stated below, 27 May was the hottest day of the year in 2012 {{in most parts of the}} UK. In Aberdaron, the hottest day of 2011 was very early on in the year on 21 April. Temperatures in March seldom reach 20°C, as they did in 1990, 1993, 2012 and 2017, and this temperature is usually reached for the first time in April or May. Throughout spring, there can be very dramatic temperature swings between <b>day</b> <b>night.</b> On 9 April 2017, night-time temperatures fell to just 3°C at Northolt, but 25°C was reached in the afternoon. Warmth in Spring depends almost entirely on the strength of the sun, and can trigger thunderstorms and downpours.|$|E

It could also automatically track the target by controlling the director's bearing power drive. Because of radar, Fire Control systems are able to track and fire at targets at a greater range and with increased accuracy during the <b>day,</b> <b>night,</b> or inclement weather. This was demonstrated in November 1942 when the battleship [...] engaged the Imperial Japanese Navy battlecruiser Kirishima at a range of [...] at night. The engagement left Kirishima in flames, and she was ultimately scuttled by her crew.
