25|$|The huge {{losses on}} the battlefields were {{not limited to}} men. The army quickly ran short of rifles and {{ammunition}} (as well as uniforms and food), and, by mid-1915, men were {{being sent to the}} <b>front</b> <b>bearing</b> no arms. It was hoped that they could equip themselves with the arms that they recovered from fallen soldiers, of both sides, on the battlefields. The soldiers did not feel that they were being treated as human beings, or even as valuable soldiers, but rather as raw materials to be squandered {{for the purposes of the}} rich and powerful.|$|E
2500|$|Conrail {{was divided}} between Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation in 1999, with all {{remaining}} locomotives having been repainted, but ex-CR units can be spotted. CR units had similar {{features such as}} [...] "Bright Future" [...] blue paint, flashing ditch lights, and Leslie RS-3L horns. Another key spotting feature is ditchlights mounted under the locomotive's front deck. This is a preference different from Norfolk Southern, who orders their locomotives with the lights above the deck. Marker lights, or class lights, were also a preference of Conrail. Most Conrail engines still have marker lights on CSX, while NS opted to remove them. All Conrail locomotives that went to CSX were re-painted into CSX colors. All of the Conrail units owned by NS have been either repainted or retired, as the last unit in 'Big Blue' being NS 8312, was retired. Conrail was the only railroad to receive EMD SD80MACs (the Chicago North & Western were originally supposed to receive SD80MACs with marker lights, but when that railroad merged with Union Pacific, the order was rescinded) and were separated evenly between CSX and NS. Conrail had a different scheme for these locomotives and also the SD70MAC, with a large white, cone shaped line on the <b>front,</b> <b>bearing</b> [...] "Conrail Quality". The SD70MACs weren't fitted with marker lights, {{as it would be}} useless when given to NS and CSX. This goes along with the standard-cab SD70, Conrail's final order of locomotives, as they were in Norfolk Southern's preferred numbering (the 2500 series).|$|E

60|$|No {{sooner had}} the gardeners quitted the arena, than a solemn and {{imposing}} train appeared {{to occupy the}} sward. Four females marched to the <b>front,</b> <b>bearing</b> an antique altar that was decorated with suitable devices. They were clad in emblematical dresses, and wore garlands of flowers on their heads. Boys carrying censers preceded an altar that was dedicated to Flora, and her ministering official came after it, mitred and carrying flowers. Like all the priestesses that followed, she was laboriously attired in the robes that denoted her sacred duty. The goddess herself was borne by four females on a throne canopied by flowers, and from whose several parts sweeping festoons of every hue and die descended to the earth. Haymakers of both sexes, gay and pastoral in their air and attire, succeeded, and a car groaning with the sweet-scented grass of the Alps, accompanied by females bearing rakes, brought up the rear.|$|E

Pedicels of the cirri not particularly protuberant in front. First cirrus with rami, slightly unequal in length; not short; basal segments much thicker and more protuberant than the upper segments.

60|$|Cirri.--The five {{posterior}} pair are elongated, {{very little}} curled, with short pedicels; their segments are long, {{not at all}} protuberant in <b>front,</b> <b>bearing</b> five or six pairs of long, slightly serrated spines, with a very minute tuft of bristles between each pair, and with some short lateral spines {{on the inner side}} of each segment; on the fourth pair of cirri, these lateral spines are considerably developed; dorsal tufts consist of fine spines, with one much longer than the others. First pair short, separated by a wide interval from the second; rami unequal in length, by between two and four segments; longer ramus having nine segments, scarcely half as long as the rami of the second cirrus; shorter ramus with seven segments; in the same individual there were twenty segments in the sixth cirrus. The segments in the shorter ramus of the first cirrus are oblong in a transverse direction, and may be compared to a set of shields placed transversely and strung together; in the longer ramus the segments are longitudinally oblong; in both they are thickly covered with spines. Second cirrus; the anterior ramus is a little broader than the posterior ramus, with the segments bearing about five rows of bristles; fifteen segments in the shorter ramus. Third pair, with the two rami equal in thickness, and with the segments differing very little from those of the posterior cirri, excepting that the serrated spines in the external lateral rows are rather larger. The fourth pair is remarkable by having, on the inner side of the upper edge of each segment, a little tuft of minute smooth spines, flattened, and a little enlarged near their ends, so as to be spear-shaped; I could not see these singular spines on the other cirri. The lower segments of the pedicels of all the cirri, excepting the sixth pair, are remarkable from having their inner edges, in the middle, produced into a considerable, abrupt, rounded projection, irregularly covered with spines.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} cutting force {{monitoring}} for high-precision machining. The authors have employed displacement sensors {{to monitor the}} cutting forces, as they are cheap and small enough {{to be built in}} the spindle structure. A monitoring method, which utilizes sensitive displacement sensors, is discussed. The sensors are installed in XY directions near the <b>front</b> <b>bearings</b> of the spindle to detect the small displacements of a spindle caused by cutting forces. Monitoring tests are carried out under end-milling operations and the cutting forces are estimated from the displacement signals by the simple signal processing technique. However, as the displacement sensor measures the variation of the gap size between the sensor head and the target surface, it also records displacements due to error motion of a spindle's axis of rotation in radial direction and roundness errors of the target surface. By comparing the cutting force estimated from displacement sensors with the cutting force measured by using a dynamometer, the machine tool spindle error motions are investigated, and its compensation scheme is proposed. The test results show that the monitoring system is reliable for the adaptive control of machining accuracy for end-milling process...|$|R
