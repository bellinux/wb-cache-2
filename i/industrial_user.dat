40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to: * examine how grantee firms of the Western Australian Innovation Support Scheme (WAISS) have {{overcome}} their impediments to commercialisation; * examine how the process of user-producer interaction has enabled grantee firms to commercialise their technologies; * examine the process of user-producer interaction with large and/or small <b>industrial</b> <b>users,</b> and the subsequent benefits derived; * examine the entry barriers faced by grantee firms in forming interactions with large <b>industrial</b> <b>users.</b> The study examined the literature involving the role of small firms in the development and commercialisation of new technologies. The study adopted a multiple, holistic case study design using qualitative methodology, A theoretical pathway constructed from arguments presented within the literature was the basis upon which the cases were analysed. The cases have demonstrated that the adoption of strategies promoting user-producer interaction through a dyadic problem-solving style approach with <b>industrial</b> <b>users</b> have enabled small firms to commercialise their technologies in industry. The cases have found that those firms interacting with large <b>industrial</b> <b>users</b> have experienced extensive product diversification and market expansion opportunities as opposed to those firms interacting with small <b>industrial</b> <b>users.</b> In addition to the product diversification and market expansion opportunities acquired through interactions with these large <b>industrial</b> <b>users,</b> it was clear that the large-scale marketing and distribution resources of these <b>industrial</b> <b>users</b> also enabled small firms to attract other <b>industrial</b> <b>users,</b> both domestically and internationally. This ultimately led to further product diversification and market expansion opportunities. Those firms that interacted with small <b>industrial</b> <b>users</b> experienced either minimal or no product diversification and market expansion opportunities because of the ‘small firm’ characteristics or these users. This meant that as 2 ̆ 7 small firms 2 ̆ 7 these <b>industrial</b> <b>users</b> also faced constraints with regards to the availability of marketing resources and distribution channels, and were therefore unable to attract the interests of <b>industrial</b> <b>users</b> within large-scale markets. Those firms that experienced either minimal or no product diversification and market expansion opportunities have faced entry barriers typical to small firms when trying to find large <b>industrial</b> <b>users</b> for their technologies. They have been unable to attract the interests of large <b>industrial</b> <b>users</b> as a result of the high risk factors associated with the newness of their technologies and their credibility as a newly established firm. The study 2 ̆ 7 s main finding reveals that the commercialisation of small firm technologies, the commercial extent derived for these technologies, and the overcoming of barriers faced by the small firm, was dependent on the social orientation of user-producer interaction in conjunction with the dyadic information exchanges of technological opportunities and user needs...|$|R

40|$|A {{marketing}} organization’s distribution {{capability is}} an important determinant of its success. A product cannot reach its target market if distribution is not planned and executed carefully. Producers often involve the services of middlemen in bringing their products to markets. The producer, the intermediary (or intermediaries) and the consumer or <b>industrial</b> <b>user</b> constitutes the marketing channel for the product. A marketing channel (channel of distribution) is the series of marketing institutions that facilitates transfer of title to a product as it moves from producer to ultimate consumer or <b>industrial</b> <b>user.</b> Producers, middlemen and final buyers are participants in a channel (channel members). A middlemen (marketing intermediary or reseller) is a person or firm, such as a wholesaler, that operates between the producer and the final buyer of a product. Middlemen specialize in buying and selling, but also perform other marketing functions such as risk taking, assembling, financing, storage, transportation, marketing research, and promotion. All channels have a producer and an ultimate consumer/user. But when a producer sells directly to the final buyer, there are no middlemen in the channel. The producer and/or buyer must perform these functions. Marketing channels create utility, improve exchange efficiency and help {{in the process of}} matching demand and supply.
