50|$|Brazing {{has many}} {{advantages}} over other metal-joining techniques, such as welding. Since brazing does not melt the base metal of the joint, it allows much tighter control over tolerances and produces a clean joint {{without the need}} for secondary finishing. Additionally, dissimilar metals and non-metals (i.e. metalized ceramics) can <b>be</b> <b>brazed.</b> In general, brazing also produces less thermal distortion than welding due to the uniform heating of a brazed piece. Complex and multi-part assemblies can <b>be</b> <b>brazed</b> cost-effectively. Welded joints must sometimes be ground flush, a costly secondary operation that brazing does not require because it produces a clean joint. Another advantage <b>is</b> that the <b>brazing</b> can <b>be</b> coated or clad for protective purposes. Finally, <b>brazing</b> <b>is</b> easily adapted to mass production and it is easy to automate because the individual process parameters are less sensitive to variation.|$|R

50|$|Manual {{torch brazing}} is a {{procedure}} where {{the heat is}} applied using a gas flame placed {{on or near the}} joint being brazed. The torch can either be hand held or held in a fixed position depending on whether the operation is completely manual or has some level of automation. Manual brazing is most commonly used on small production volumes or in applications where the part size or configuration makes other brazing methods impossible. The main drawback is the high labor cost associated with the method as well as the operator skill required to obtain quality brazed joints. The use of flux or self-fluxing material is required to prevent oxidation. Torch brazing of copper can be done without the use of flux if it <b>is</b> <b>brazed</b> with a torch using oxygen and hydrogen gas, rather than oxygen and other flammable gases.|$|E
50|$|The CuproBraze {{technology}} uses brazing {{instead of}} soldering to join copper and brass radiator components. The heat exchangers {{are made with}} anneal-resistant copper and brass alloys. The tubes are fabricated from brass strip and coated with a brazing filler material in form of a powder based paste or an amorphous brazing foil is laid between the tube and fin. There is another method of coating the tube in-line on the tube mill. This is done using the twin wire-arc spray process where the wire is the braze alloy, deposited on the tube as it is being manufactured at 200-400 fpm. This saves one process step of coating the tube later. The coated tubes, along with copper fins, headers and side supports made of brass, are fitted together into a core assembly which <b>is</b> <b>brazed</b> in a furnace.|$|E

In the present study, the finite element model was first calibrated by test. Three design parameters were then chosen to evaluate the impact of variation of these parameters on the attachment shear strength. Analysis {{results indicate that the}} solder pad size is the most critical parameter affecting this shear strength, and the misalignment between the sphere and the solder pad is the next most critical. Therefore, to effectively improve the attachment shear strength, it is recommended to: (1) Use a larger solder pad; and (2) Minimize the misalignment between the sphere and the mounting solder pad.

40|$|The use of strain-isolated ceramic coated {{material}} {{to produce an}} AGT 1500 combustor scroll-shaped transition duct which requires no air for film cooling is investigated. The scroll receives the exhaust of the can-style combustor liner and turns it into the annular inlet of the high pressure gas producer turbine nozzle. Strain-isolation of plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating is achieved by placing a compliant pad between the structural base metal and the ceramic coating. The compliant pad <b>is</b> <b>brazed</b> to the metal structure. In order to achieve a good braze bond, the strain-isolating compliant pad and base metal must be closely matched in shape and tightly fixtured for joining. The complex geometry of the AGT 1500 scroll makes it impractical to attack pads to the supporting structure in its finished shape. Instead the pads are brazed to flat stock and post-formed into scroll sections. While test samples were successfully post-formed, plasma sprayed, and subjected to cyclic heating, the forming of full scale parts by normal methods resulted in tearing of the Hastelloy-X base metal because of embrittlement by the braze material. Several solutions were explored which finally resulted in the successful forming of full scale scroll parts...|$|E

50|$|Vacuum {{furnaces}} is {{a relatively}} economical method of oxide prevention and is most often used to braze materials with very stable oxides (aluminum, titanium and zirconium) that cannot <b>be</b> <b>brazed</b> in atmosphere furnaces. Vacuum <b>brazing</b> <b>is</b> also used heavily with refractory materials and other exotic alloy combinations unsuited to atmosphere furnaces.

The three main types of vacuum furnace are: single-wall hot retort, double-walled hot retort, and cold-wall retort. Typical vacuum levels for brazing range from pressures of 1.3 to 0.13 pascals (10−2 to 10−3 Torr) to 0.00013 Pa (10−6 Torr) or lower. Vacuum furnaces are most commonly batch-type, and they are suited to medium and high production volumes.|$|R
