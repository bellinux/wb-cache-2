5|$|Although the B-DNA form is {{most common}} under the {{conditions}} found in cells, {{it is not}} a well-defined conformation but a family of related DNA conformations that occur at the high <b>hydration</b> levels present in living cells. Their corresponding X-ray diffraction and scattering patterns are characteristic of molecular paracrystals with a significant degree of disorder.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{exists in}} many {{possible}} conformations that include A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA forms, although, only B-DNA and Z-DNA have been directly observed in functional organisms. The conformation that DNA adopts {{depends on the}} <b>hydration</b> level, DNA sequence, the amount and direction of supercoiling, chemical modifications of the bases, the type and concentration of metal ions, {{and the presence of}} polyamines in solution.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{measures}} can include rest, caffeine intake (via coffee or intravenous infusion), and <b>hydration.</b> Corticosteroids may provide transient relief for some patients. An abdominal binder — {{a type of}} garment that increases intracranial pressure by compressing the abdomen — can temporarily relieve symptoms for some people.|$|E
5|$|Intravenous <b>hydration,</b> if required, is {{typically}} only needed {{for one or}} two days. In children with shock due to dengue a rapid dose of 20mL/kg is reasonable. The rate of fluid administration is than titrated to a urinary output of 0.5–1mL/kg/h, stable vital signs and normalization of hematocrit. The smallest amount of fluid required to achieve this is recommended.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the commercialization}} of the Monsanto process, most acetic acid was {{produced}} by oxidation of acetaldehyde. This remains the second-most-important manufacturing method, although it is usually not competitive with the carbonylation of methanol. The acetaldehyde can be produced by <b>hydration</b> of acetylene. This was the dominant technology in the early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous lipids make an {{important}} contribution in maintaining {{the integrity of the}} skin barrier, and express both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Sebum may act as a delivery system for antioxidants, antimicrobial lipids, pheromones, and <b>hydration</b> of the stratum corneum. The insoluble fatty acids contained within sebum have broad antimicrobial activity. Additionally, sebaceous gland secretion provides vitamin E to the upper layers of facial skin.|$|E
5|$|The {{absorption}} band of simple cations shift toward shorter wavelength {{when they are}} involved in more covalent interactions. This occurs during <b>hydration</b> of metal ions, so colourless anhydrous ionic compounds with an anion absorbing in the infrared can become colourful in solution.|$|E
5|$|A {{mendelevium}} atom has 101 electrons, {{of which}} at least three (and perhaps four) can act as valence electrons. They {{are expected to be}} arranged in the configuration 5f137s2 (ground state term symbol 2F7/2), although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006. In forming compounds, three valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind a 5f12 core: this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of mendelevium was measured to be at most (6.58±0.07)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones; this value has since not yet been refined further due to mendelevium's scarcity and high radioactivity. The ionic radius of hexacoordinate Md3+ had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 91.2pm; 1988 calculations based on the logarithmic trend between distribution coefficients and ionic radius produced a value of 89.6pm, as well as an enthalpy of <b>hydration</b> of −(3654±12)kJ·mol−1. Md2+ should have an ionic radius of 115pm and <b>hydration</b> enthalpy −1413kJ·mol−1; Md+ should have ionic radius 117pm.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in the nineteenth century, OFC is currently detected {{through a combination of}} blood testing, X-rays, and tissue sampling. Before 1950, around half of those diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism in the United States saw it progress to OFC, but with early identification techniques and improved treatment methods, instances of OFC in developed countries are increasingly rare. Where treatment is required, it normally involves addressing the underlying hyperparathyroidism before commencing long-term treatment for OFCdepending on its cause and severity, this can range from <b>hydration</b> and exercise to surgical intervention.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the final, Hamm {{collapsed in the}} locker room from severe <b>hydration.</b> She was treated by medical staff with an intravenous drip and three liters of fluids. After 12 hours of sleep, she joined the team for magazine cover shoots, went to Disneyland for a celebration rally, and made numerous television appearances. A week later, the team met President Clinton at the White House and flew with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton on Air Force One to Cape Canaveral. Her leadership and performance at the 1999 World Cup cemented Hamm as a soccer icon.|$|E
5|$|In March 2000, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} to permit {{assisted}} feeding of Terri, which is not considered a life-prolonging procedure under Florida law. Since clinical records indicated that Terri Schiavo was not responsive to swallowing tests and required a feeding tube, Judge Greer ruled {{that she was not}} capable of orally ingesting sufficient nutrition and <b>hydration</b> to sustain life, and denied the request. The Medical Examiner in his postmortem report was more definitive and reaffirmed that Schiavo could not have swallowed.|$|E
5|$|Many {{properties}} of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and samarium. For example, the melting point, {{the first three}} ionization energies, and the <b>hydration</b> energy are greater than those of neodymium and {{lower than those of}} samarium; similarly, the estimate for the boiling point, ionic (Pm3+) radius, and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater than those of samarium and less those of neodymium.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are {{more similar to}} each other than the {{elements}} in any other group are to each other. Indeed, the similarity {{is so great that}} it is quite difficult to separate potassium, rubidium, and caesium, due to their similar ionic radii; lithium and sodium are more distinct. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium. One of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials: lithium's value is anomalous, being more negative than the others. This is because the Li+ ion has a very high <b>hydration</b> energy in the gas phase: though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly, causing a higher change in entropy, this high <b>hydration</b> energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal, despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of calcium {{is that of}} a typical heavy alkaline earth metal. For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form a mixture of calcium oxide and calcium nitride. When finely divided, it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride. In bulk, calcium is less reactive: it quickly forms a <b>hydration</b> coating in moist air, but below 30% relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations. Circulation in the bloodstream was extremely limited due to both renal clearing and phagocytosis. Refinement of the lipid composition to tune fluidity, surface charge density, and surface <b>hydration</b> resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system. The most significant advance in this area was the grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto the liposome surface to produce “stealth” vesicles, which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for this condition is the surgical application of epidural blood patches, which has a higher success rate than conservative treatments of bed rest and <b>hydration.</b> Through the injection of a person's own blood into {{the area of the}} hole in the dura, an epidural blood patch uses blood's clotting factors to clot the sites of holes. The volume of autologous blood and number of patch attempts for patients is highly variable. One-quarter to one-third of SCSFLS patients do not have relief of symptoms from epidural blood patching.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{butterflies}} consume only liquids, ingested {{through the}} proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for <b>hydration</b> and feed on nectar from flowers, {{from which they}} obtain sugars for energy, and sodium and other minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; they sometimes land on people, attracted by the salt in human sweat. Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this mud-puddling behaviour is restricted to the males, and {{studies have suggested that}} the nutrients collected may be provided as a nuptial gift, along with the spermatophore, during mating.|$|E
5|$|The {{triggers}} for precipitation of {{uric acid}} {{are not well}} understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, {{it is more likely}} to do so as levels increase. Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular <b>hydration</b> and extracellular matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens and chondroitin sulfate. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics and stopping or starting allopurinol. Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Sports and <b>hydration</b> backpacks {{are smaller}} with a profile {{closer to the}} body, wider straps and can come with water {{bladders}} and hip belts for running, cycling or hiking. Camelbak is one such company {{best known for its}} <b>hydration</b> pack.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydration</b> {{involves}} {{many different}} reactions, often occurring {{at the same}} time. As the reactions proceed, {{the products of the}} cement <b>hydration</b> process gradually bond together the individual sand and gravel particles and other components of the concrete to form a solid mass.|$|E
25|$|Obsidian <b>hydration</b> dating is a geochemical {{method of}} {{determining}} age in either absolute or relative {{terms of an}} artifact made of obsidian. Obsidian <b>hydration</b> dating was introduced in 1960 by Irving Friedman and Robert Smith of the United States Geological Survey.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} <b>hydration</b> shells is well {{developed}} in the physical chemistry literature however a simple model is required that captures the essential effects with as little computational overhead as possible. For this purpose the same pairwise potential discussed by Im and Roux is implemented to include the effect of <b>hydration</b> shells.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous <b>hydration</b> may be {{required}} to maintain adequate blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Reaction 3 {{describes}} the <b>hydration</b> of olivine with water only to yield serpentine and Mg(OH)2 (brucite). Serpentine is stable at high pH {{in the presence}} of brucite like calcium silicate hydrate, (C-S-H) phases formed along with portlandite (Ca(OH)2) in hardened Portland cement paste after the <b>hydration</b> of belite (Ca2SiO4), the artificial calcium equivalent of forsterite.|$|E

25|$|The {{color and}} volume of urine can be {{reliable}} indicators of <b>hydration</b> level. Clear and copious urine is generally {{a sign of}} adequate <b>hydration.</b> Dark urine {{is a sign of}} dehydration. The exception occurs when diuretics or excessive amounts of alcohol or caffeine are consumed, in which case urine can be clear and copious and the person still be dehydrated.|$|E
25|$|Dehydration or {{hyperhydration}} {{can greatly}} influence measured hemoglobin levels. Albumin can indicate <b>hydration</b> status.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydration</b> is {{also used}} industrially to produce the diol {{ethylene}} glycol from ethylene oxide.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{germination}} {{has three}} stages; <b>hydration,</b> activation and pollen tube emergence. The pollen grain is severely dehydrated {{so that its}} mass is reduced enabling it to be more easily transported from flower to flower. Germination only takes place after rehydration, ensuring that premature germination does not {{take place in the}} anther. <b>Hydration</b> allows the plasma membrane of the pollen grain to reform into its normal bilayer organization providing an effective osmotic membrane. Activation involves the development of actin filaments throughout the cytoplasm of the cell, which eventually become concentrated at the point from which the pollen tube will emerge. <b>Hydration</b> and activation continue as the pollen tube begins to grow.|$|E
25|$|Campylobacteriosis {{is usually}} self-limited without any {{mortality}} (assuming proper <b>hydration</b> is maintained). However, {{there are several}} possible complications.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Marines {{can wear}} a watch cap and gloves in cold weather, or a <b>hydration</b> pack to prevent dehydration.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequential}} oxidation {{of sulfur}} dioxide followed by its <b>hydration</b> {{is used in the}} production of sulfuric acid.|$|E
25|$|Alkenes {{can also}} be {{converted}} into alcohols via the oxymercuration–demercuration reaction , the hydroboration–oxidation reaction or by Mukaiyama <b>hydration.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ethanol {{may also}} be {{produced}} industrially from ethylene by <b>hydration</b> of the double bond {{in the presence of}} catalysts and high temperature.|$|E
25|$|Low {{molecular}} weight alcohols of industrial importance {{are produced by}} the addition of water to alkenes. Ethanol, isopropanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol are produced by this general method. Two implementations are employed, the direct and indirect methods. The direct method avoids the formation of stable intermediates, typically using acid catalysts. In the indirect method, the alkene is converted to the sulfate ester, which is subsequently hydrolyzed. The direct <b>hydration</b> using ethylene (ethylene <b>hydration)</b> or other alkenes from cracking of fractions of distilled crude oil.|$|E
