40|$|Electrostatic ion {{chromatography}} (EIC) using a zwitterionic stationary phase (formed by coating a C 18 material with a hydrophobic zwitterionic surfactant) was studied with a mobile phase comprising an aqueous solution of histidine at the pH of its isoelectric point, together with non-suppressed conductometric detection. Anions and cations {{were found to}} be eluted as separate peaks, unlike the elution behaviour observed on the same system when pure water was used as mobile phase. An explanation was suggested in terms of protonation equilibria of the overall uncharged histidine to form small amounts of histidine cations and anions in the mobile phase which could act as counterions for analyte anions and cations. This suggestion was supported by measured pH changes occurring in the bands of <b>eluted</b> <b>analyte</b> anions (a decreased pH compared to the mobile phase) and cations (an increased pH compared to the mobile phase).

40|$|Chromatographic techniques, and in {{particular}} ion-exchange methods, have long been used {{for the analysis of}} inorganic ions using diverse monitoring techniques such as conductivity, polarography and spectrophotometry. A major advance in this field occurred in 1975, when Small et al. described a novel system for the chromatographic determination of inorganic ions, in which a specially developed pellicular resin was used to effect the separation and a second ion-exchange column to reduce the background conductivity of the eluent in order to improve the detection limits for the <b>eluted</b> <b>analyte</b> ions. This system, which is described in detail later, illustrated the enormous potential of chromatography for inorganic ion analysis and deservedly received considerable research attention for some years. An important side effect of this development was to stimulate greatly research into alternative chromatographic methods suitable for inorganic ions, and over the past 7 years a considerable volume of material has been published. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to review these alternative methods, and therefore those articles which employ the same or a similar technique to that used by Small et al. will be discussed only briefly in order to provide a basis for comparison with other methods. Further to the above specific restriction, this review will be confined to a discussion of methods that are chiefly applicable to anion analysis, because until very recently these methods have far outnumbered those for cation analysis. The preponderance of research into chromatographic methods for anions strongly reflects the paucity of alternative analytical procedures. This situation does not apply to cations, for which a number of excellent rapid and sensitive spectroscopic techniques (such as atomic-absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma atomic-emission spectrometry) and electrochemical methods (such as polarography and anodic-stripping voltammetry) are available. Moreover, many of these are multi-element techniques and so duplicate one of the chief attractions of chromatography for inorganic cation analysis. Despite this, much of the experience gained from the intensive development of chromatographic approaches to inorganic anion analysis has recently been applied successfully to inorganic cations. At this stage, however, it is fair to say that these chromatographic methods for cations are generally inferior to the existing spectroscopic and electrochemical methods mentioned above. In contrast, the use of chromatography for anion analysis has proved so successful that chromatographic methods are among the best available and have been applied to a wide range of inorganic species. This success can be attributed to concurrent advances in separation technology and detection methods, and in this review these two aspects will be described separately...|$|E

40|$|A polymer {{monolith}} bearing weak cation-exchange functionality {{was prepared}} {{for the purpose of}} demonstrating pH-selective extraction and elution in in-line solid-phase extraction–capillary electrophoresis (SPE–CE) utilising a model set of cationic analytes, namely imidazole, lutidine and 3 -phenylpropanamine. Optimization of the electrolyte conditions for efficient elution of the adsorbed analytes using a moving pH boundary required that the capillary and monolith be filled with 44 mM sodium acetate at high pH (pH 6) and a low pH electrolyte of 3 mM sodium acetate pH 3 was placed in the electrolyte vials. This combination allowed the adsorbed analytes to be simultaneously eluted and focused into narrow bands, with peak widths of the <b>eluted</b> <b>analytes</b> having a baseline width of 1. 2 s immediately after the monolith. Using these optimum elution conditions, the versatility of the SPE–CE approach was demonstrated by removing unwanted adsorbed components after extraction with a wash at a different pH and also by selecting a pH at which only some of the model weak bases were ionised.

This method was evaluated for the study of drug-protein interactions by using it along with high-performance affinity chromatography to measure the dissociation rate constants for R- and S-warfarin from columns containing immobilized human serum albumin (HSA). Several factors were considered in the optimization of this method, including the amount of applied analyte, the column size, and the flow rate.

Both surfactants utilised (namely dodecyldimethylaminoacetic acid and N-dodecyl-N,N- (dimethylammonio) undecanoate (DDMAU)) had a similar structure, with an internal, positively charged ammonium group, and an external, negatively charged carboxylate group, but DDMAU was found to exhibit superior column coating stability, due to its increased hydrophobic character. Both surfactants {{were found to have}} a pH dependent effective ion-exchange capacity, with increased eluent pH values resulting in reduced analyte anion retention times, due to increased protonation of the weak acid terminal group of the surfactant molecules. The suitability of these carboxybetaine-modified stationary phases to the determination of nutrient anions in high-ionic strength environmental sample matrices (e. g. seawater samples) has been demonstrated. The ability to apply dual gradient programs (i. e. with a combined eluent pH and flow gradient) provided the opportunity to expedite the elution, and improve the efficiency, of later <b>eluting</b> <b>analyte</b> peaks (i. e. polarisable anions such as iodide and thiocyanate), without sacrificing the resolution and efficiency of earlier eluting anions (e. g. iodate, nitrite etc.).

The key to successful HIV treatment is strict adherence to the prescribed regimen. The combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine and efavirenz co-formulated in a single tablet (Atripla) provides a &#x 2018;one tablet once a day&#x 2019; regimen, making adherence easier for patients. Tenofovir and emtricitabine are converted intracellularly to active phosphate anabolites. Therefore, knowledge of intracellular pharmacokinetics should aid understanding of the virological response and toxicity of these agents. This intracellular methodology has been developed and applied to clinical trial samples. Method: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from whole blood by gradient centrifugation using ficoll. PBMC were counted and lysed (70 % MeOH) giving a final cell density of 2 &#x 00 D 7; 106 cells/ml. Lysate was centrifuged, supernatant (intracellular matrix), was spiked with drug anabolites at various concentrations to produce standard curves and quality controls (QC). Samples were extracted by protein precipitation (acetonitrile), evaporated to dryness, internal standard (IS) added, and reconstituted in 5 mM ammonuim formate. Weak anion exchange chromatography with an optimised step-wise gradient, interfaced with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in SRM with positive ionisation mode was used for quantification. Results: <b>Analytes</b> <b>eluted</b> within 12 minutes run-time with adequate separation.

40|$|Personal care {{products}} (PCPs) constitute {{a diverse group}} of chemicals that have recently been recognized as emerging contaminants of the aquatic environment, where they are continually introduced primarily by both untreated and treated sewage. They include compounds belonging to different chemical classes: surfactants in detergents (alkyl benzenes), fragrances in cosmetics (nitro and polycyclic musks), antioxidants and preservatives (phenols), plasticizers (phthalates). A multi-analytical method is required to determine these compounds and their bioactive metabolites in wastewater: even if LC/MS and LC/MS/MS are the most common analytical techniques for these soluble compounds, GC/MS and GC/MS/MS are sometimes used to identify and quantify volatile compounds and metabolites, in particular when resolution is mandatory to separate isomers or congeners. In the paper a GC/MS method is presented for the simultaneous analysis of PCPs belonging to different chemical classes in wastewaters: preconcentration and clean-up of the soluble components were performed using solid-phase extraction (SPE) prior to GC-MS determination. Due to the complexity of the aquatic environment where PCPs are introduced as complex mixtures, the chromatograms obtained from wastewater samples are complex signals whose interpretation can be difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, a signal processing procedure can be helpful to extract chemical information on the sample — number of components, abundance distribution — and separation — separation performance, retention pattern.

It has found applications in healthcare, industrial safety, homeland security, and environmental studies. However to extend its use from lab based to in-situ based applications it is vital to miniaturize the systems to develop so called micro-gas chromatographs (micro-GC). There are a multitude of issues associated with developing µGC systems. Most of these issues arise from miniaturization of the various components used in GC systems. From a sensing point of view, many sensors that have been reported are too bulky or fragile for use in portable GC systems, show a lack of uniformity in their sensing responses, or have very long response times prohibiting their use in micro-GC. This dissertation presents the development of optical and electrical sensors aimed at alleviating some of these issues. 	The first optical sensor developed consists of a polymer sensing film coated on silicon substrate via a variety of methods including, spin coating, drop coating, and spray coating. Several issues with the Fabry-Perot (FP) are discussed and solved including non-uniformity of responses, reproducibility, dead volumes due to integration, and fabrication of sensor arrays. The sensors showed excellent sensitivity, with detection limits as low as 0. 7 pg. An array of these sensors was also demonstrated and showed promise for use in pattern analysis and analyte discrimination. 	The second optical sensor characterized, worked on the principle of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The sensor was shown be capable of differentiating between vapors without the need for an array, i. e. with the use of only a single sensor. However the low sensitivity is still a stumbling block for this type of sensor. 	The final sensor detailed within this dissertation is a high frequency graphene field effect transistor sensor (GrFET).

40|$|A {{selective}} and {{a highly}} sensitive method for {{the determination of the}} non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), efavirenz, in human plasma has been developed and fully validated based on high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). Sample preparation involved protein precipitation followed by one to one dilution with water. The analyte, efavirenz was separated by high performance liquid chromatography and detected with tandem mass spectrometry in negative ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring. Efavirenz and 13 C 6 -efavirenz (Internal Standard), respectively, were detected via the following MRM transitions: m/z 314. 20243. 90 and m/z 320. 20249. 90. A gradient program was used to <b>elute</b> the <b>analytes</b> using 0. 1 % formic acid in water and 0. 1 % formic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phase solvents, at a flow-rate of 0. 3 mL/min. The total run time was 5 min and the retention times for the internal standard (13 C 6 -efavirenz) and efavirenz was approximately 2. 6 min. The calibration curves showed linearity (coefficient of regression, r. 0. 99) over the concentration range of 1. 0 – 2, 500 ng/mL. The intraday precision based on the standard deviation of replicates of lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 9. 24 % and for quality control (QC) sample...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{method is}} provided to detect simultaneously some important veterinary drugs from different classes in highly complex animal tissue matrix. This method using matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with {{diode array detection}} (DAD) is developed to effectively determine two fluoroquinolones (enoxacin and lomefloxacin), two sulfonamides (sulfanilamide and sulfamethoxazole) and one tetracycline (tetracycline) simultaneously in porcine tissues. In the process, MSPD methodology was used to treat samples, washed by n-hexane to remove lipid, <b>eluted</b> the <b>analytes</b> with acetonitrileâdichloromethane (1 : 1, v/v). Solvent acetonitrile and solvent acetic acid (0. 1 %) were combined in a gradient. HPLCâDAD analysis of the tissue samples was performed within 15 Â min at a flow rate of 1. 0 Â mL/min. The results showed that a recovery at 0. 1, 0. 5 and 1. 0 Â Î¼g/g fortification levels ranged from 80. 6 % to 99. 2 % with satisfactory relative standard deviations (RSDs) (below 6. 1 %, n= 3) {{and the limits of}} quantitation (LOQ) ranged from 7 Â Î¼g/kg to 34 Â Î¼g/kg in porcine tissues. Utilization of the method in successfully simultaneous analysis of porcine tissue incurred with veterinary drug multiresidues is described.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability to}} produce and detect {{products}} of model DNA/carcinogen ion-molecule reactions is demonstrated in the ion source and the collision cell of a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer. Reaction between adenine and benzoyl chloride in the ion source is shown to produce the DNA adduct benzoyl adenine. The daughter ion mass spectrum of the reaction product is {{compared to that of}} the synthesized standard. Mass chromatograms of the reaction between mass-selected pyridine ions and various <b>analytes</b> <b>eluting</b> from a GC column into the collision cell are demonstrated and illustrate the ability to detect only the GC eluates that react with pyridine. This technique could provide a rapid and sensitive method for screening complex environmental samples for carcinogens, as well as for estimating the relative mutagenic/carcinogenic potential of environmental contaminants...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of solid phase microextraction (SPME) {{in the analysis}} of explosives is demonstrated. A sensitive, rapid, solventless and inexpensive method for the analysis of explosives and explosive odors from solid and liquid samples has been optimized using SPME followed by HPLC and GC/ECD. SPME involves the extraction of the organic components in debris samples into sorbent-coated silica fibers, which can be transferred directly to the injector of a gas chromatograph. SPME/HPLC requires a special desorption apparatus to <b>elute</b> the extracted <b>analyte</b> onto the column at high pressure. Re suits for use of GC[ECD is presented and compared to the results gathered by using HPLC analysis. The relative effects of controllable variables including fiber chemistry, adsorption and desorption temperature, extraction time, and desorption time have been optimized for various high explosives...|$|R
