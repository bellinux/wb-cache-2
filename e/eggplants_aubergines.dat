2500|$|In botany, a berry is a {{fleshy fruit}} without a stone {{produced}} {{from a single}} flower containing one ovary. Berries so defined include grapes, currants, and tomatoes, as well as cucumbers, <b>eggplants</b> (<b>aubergines)</b> and bananas, but exclude certain fruits commonly called berries, such as strawberries and raspberries. The berry {{is the most common}} type of fleshy fruit in which the entire outer layer of the ovary wall ripens into a potentially edible [...] "pericarp". Berries may be formed from one or more carpels from the same flower (i.e. from a simple or a compound ovary). The seeds are usually embedded in the fleshy interior of the ovary, but there are some non-fleshy exceptions, such as peppers, with air rather than pulp around their seeds.|$|E

Fruits excluded by the botanical definition include strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, which are aggregate fruits, and mulberries, which are multiple fruits.

5000|$|Ben-Yehuda's main {{innovation}} in {{the revival of the}} Hebrew language lies in his having [...] "invented" [...] many new words to denote objects unknown in Jewish antiquity, or which had long been forgotten in their original Hebrew usage and context. He invented words such as ḥatzilīm for <b>eggplants</b> (<b>aubergines)</b> and ḥashmal for electricity. As no Hebrew equivalent could be found for the names of certain produce endemic to the New World, they devised new Hebrew words for maize and tomato, calling them tiras (Heb. תירס) and ʿagḇaniyyah (Heb. עגבניה), respectively. The latter word is derived from the shape of the vegetable, which resembled a buttocks (Heb. ʿagaḇīm). Sometimes, old Hebrew words took on different meanings altogether. For example, the Hebrew word kǝvīš (כביש), which now denotes a [...] "street" [...] or a [...] "road," [...] is actually an Aramaic adjective meaning [...] "trodden down; blazoned", rather than a common noun. It was originally used to describe [...] "a blazoned trail." [...] In what most rabbis view as an error, Ben-Yehuda is accredited with introducing the new Hebrew word [...] "ribah" [...] (רבה) for [...] "confiture; marmalade," [...] believing it to be derived from the lexical root reḇaḇ, and related to the Arabic word murabba (jam; fruit conserves; marmalade). He also invented the word [...] "tapuz" [...] for the fruit citrus orange, which is a combination of [...] "tapuach" [...] (apple) + [...] "zahav" [...] (golden), or [...] "golden apple." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{revival of}} the Hebrew {{language}} was led by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Modern Hebrew used Biblical Hebrew morphemes, Mishnaic spelling, and Sephardic pronunciation. Idioms and calques were made from Yiddish. Its acceptance by the early Jewish immigrants to Ottoman Palestine was primarily due to support from the organisations of Edmond James de Rothschild in the 1880s and the official status it received in the 1922 constitution of the British Mandate for Palestine. Jews from Arabs lands also brought with them many loanwords borrowed from the Arabic language (e.g. na'ana, zaatar, kusbara, khasa, lubiya, hummus, etc.). The words gerev (sing.) / garbayim (pl.) were applied to [...] "socks," [...] a derivative of the Arabic ğuwārib ("socks"). Ben-Yehuda used a stock of 8,000 words from the Bible and 20,000 words from rabbinical commentaries and codified and planned the new language, Modern Hebrew. Some words he invented, such as ḥatzilīm for <b>eggplants</b> (<b>aubergines)</b> and ḥashmal for electricity.
