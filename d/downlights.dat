50|$|Halogen lamps get {{hotter than}} regular {{incandescent}} lamps because {{the heat is}} concentrated on a smaller envelope surface, and because the surface {{is closer to the}} filament. This high temperature is essential to their operation. Because the halogen lamp operates at very high temperatures, it can pose fire and burn hazards. In Australia, numerous house fires each year are attributed to ceiling-mounted halogen <b>downlights.</b> The Western Australia Department of Fire and Emergency Services recommends that home owners consider instead using compact fluorescent lamps or light emitting diode lamps because they produce less heat. Some safety codes now require halogen bulbs to be protected by a grid or grille, especially for high-power (1-2 kW) bulbs used in theatre, or by the glass and metal housing of the fixture to prevent ignition of draperies or flammable objects in contact with the lamp.|$|E

40|$|Light-emitting diode (LED) MR 16 lamps have {{recently}} {{become part of}} the residential lighting market, bringing with them a new lighting paradigm. Consumers previously accustomed to halogen MR 16 technology must now select suitable LED replacements based on their photometric information. In the wake of stories of exaggerated lumen outputs and inaccurate marketing literature, this research takes a snapshot of MR 16 LED residential lighting in New Zealand to evaluate its status. Forty-eight readily available products (six repetitions of eight types) were tested in Massey University's integrating sphere. Initial investigations focused on baseline photometric values to determine whether claims of halogen equivalency were justified and if manufacturers’ photometric information was valid. Lamp quality was checked using ENERGY STAR as a basis, and variation across each six-lamp sample was checked to determine whether consistency could be assured to the consumer. The effect of heat on LEDs was investigated through a 6, 000 hour test. This saw groups of lamps running continuously in both <b>downlights</b> and free air in a simulated residential installation in Auckland, New Zealand. As well as analysing whether such mounting arrangements caused different levels of non-recoverable deterioration over time, the study also considered the general behaviour of all lamps over the test period. The study had mixed results, and revealed that care must be taken when purchasing MR 16 LED lamps in New Zealand due to these varied levels of quality. Significantly, one lamp type was found to mechanically deteriorate over time such that it proved a fire risk. This was exacerbated by high temperature and the lamps mounted in <b>downlights</b> deteriorated 2, 000 hours before their free air equivalents showed signs of similar behaviour. With 25 % of the lamps sampled in the study shown to be seriously flawed, it is clear that appropriate regulation is required {{in order to ensure that}} MR 16 LED lamps sold in New Zealand are fit for purpose. The study concludes by suggesting further areas for research which were limited by time constraints. All of these proposed investigations would enrich the existing findings...|$|E

40|$|In this project, an {{integrated}} warm-white hybrid light engine was developed. The hybrid approach involves combining phosphor-converted off-white InGaN LEDs and direct-emitting red AlInGaP LEDs {{in a single}} light engine to achieve high efficacy together with high color rendering index. We developed and integrated technology improvements in InGaN and AlInGaP die technology, phosphor technology, package architecture and encapsulation, to realize a hybrid warm-white LED package with an efficacy of 140 lm/W at a correlated color temperature of 3000 K and a color rendering index of 90, measured under representative operating conditions. This efficacy is 26 % higher than the best warm-white LEDs of similar specification that are commercially available {{at the end of}} the project. Since the InGaN- and AlInGaP-based LEDs used in the hybrid engine show different behavior as a function of current and temperature, a control system needs to be in place to ensure a stable color point over all operating conditions. In this project, we developed an electronic control circuit that is fully integrated into the light engine in such a way that the module can simply be driven by a conventional single-channel driver. The integrated control circuit uses a switch-mode boost converter topology to control the LED drive currents based on the temperature and the input current of the light engine. A color control performance of 5 SDCM was demonstrated, and improvement to 3 SDCM is considered well within reach. The combination of high efficacy and ease of integration with existing single-channel drivers is expected to facilitate the adoption of the hybrid technology and accelerate the energy savings associated with solid-state lighting. In the product commercialization plan, <b>downlights</b> and indirect-lit troffers have been selected as the first target applications for this product concept. Fully functional integrated prototypes have been developed for both applications, and the business case evaluation is ongoing as of the end of the project...|$|E

40|$|Light {{emitting}} diode (LED) -recessed <b>downlighting</b> {{is currently}} mainly used for indoor lighting of {{residential and commercial}} buildings. Maintaining a low junction temperature and increasing the lifetime and reliability of LED lighting is desirable. This study investigated designed heat sinks’ heat dissipation and capability of maintaining a low junction temperature, as well as increases in the lifetime and reliability of the lighting. This paper presents a designed traditional trapezoidal aluminum finned heat sink (ALFHS) and annular open cell copper foam heat sink (CUFHS) mounted to a 10 W compact LED-recessed <b>downlight</b> (CLRDL) and individually installed in a simulation 105 mm × 105 mm × 100 mm (L × W × H) test box. The purpose was to evaluate the temperature performance by testing the <b>downlight</b> in a small enclosed space with high ambient temperature while the LED is in operation. The <b>downlight</b> exhibited a long lifetime at normal use temperature and functioned according to Arrhenius’ law. Numerical simulation was performed first and followed by experimental validation. The heat sink design was the main factor in the heat management of the CLRDL. The heat sinks height was determined using numerical simulation and experimental validation before and after installation (INST) of the ALFHS and CUFHS. The CUFHS height was initially selected based on a larger heat dissipation capacity, and then by determining the ALFHS height. Both the ALFHS and CUFHS with the same height of 17 mm exhibited a similar capacity of heat dissipation before INST. Subsequent to INST, {{the temperature of the}} solder point of the ALFHS was higher than that of the CUFHS with an identical height of 17 mm. To compare the heat dissipation behavior of the two heat sinks, the ALFHS height was increased to 23 mm, which is 6 mm higher than that of the CUFHS. The results of a stationary simulation study for junction temperature coincides with the experimental results tested obtained using J-type thermocouples and a data acquisition system. The temperature of the solder point of the CLRDL with both the ALFHS and CUFHS was 91. 7 °C after INST, corresponding to an LED junction temperature of 121. 7 °C, which is lower than specified 135 °C LED limit temperature. The temperature distributions of specified points under natural convection were evaluated. The CLRDL installed in a small enclosed space withstood the lifetime requirements according to the results of an accelerated life test prediction. The CLRDL lumen maintenance was tested to be more than 25, 000 h. The experimental results demonstrate compliance with the Energy Star® requirements for indoor LED lighting fixtures...|$|R
