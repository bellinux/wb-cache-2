6000|$|... "Nay, aunt, {{that will}} be quite unnecessary. I will always admit that you did <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> power to--to--to--make me run straight, as the {{sporting}} men say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I {{feel that}} we're talking sense. I hope you found <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> room? I can't look after things as I would like, and so I inquire." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Prince, {{having heard}} all this, said, 'Go to the King, master, {{and tell him}} that you will provide <b>everything</b> that's <b>in</b> <b>your</b> line.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} are with all my heart. You speak like it, and look like it. You are fit for any position. <b>Everything</b> is <b>in</b> <b>your</b> favour. I do believe it. But if so--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not if <b>everything</b> was <b>in</b> <b>your</b> favor; but how if you met a boat-load of Britishers {{such as we}} {{captured}} the other night? It ain't safe to be foolin' 'round the river alone just now, an' that's a fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you realise that you're {{enjoying a}} very rare, a very {{exquisite}} privilege? You {{ought to do}} <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> power, surely, to show your sense of the greatness of your trust." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some day, Nedda, all {{the world}} will say that with you. Until then we'll fight those who won't say it. Have you got <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> room you want? Let's come and see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Professor, we'll leave <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> hands," [...] {{answered}} Fred. Even yet he did {{not feel}} just right over what had been done. He still felt that he and his cousins should have settled affairs privately with Slugger Brown and his cronies, even {{if it had been a}} matter of fist fights.|$|E
5000|$|November 19: Alvin dies. On {{his death}} bed, he {{encourages}} Smith to [...] "do <b>everything</b> that lies <b>in</b> <b>your</b> power" [...] {{to obtain the}} golden plates.|$|R
5000|$|The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) {{describes}} {{the difference between}} a TFSA and an RRSP as follows: [...] "An RRSP is primarily intended for retirement. The TFSA is like an RRSP for <b>everything</b> else <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life." [...] Interest paid on money borrowed to invest in either TFSA or RRSP is not tax deductible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Follow me, my lord," [...] Chigron said to Chebron. [...] "I {{have had}} <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> {{readiness}} for <b>your</b> reception for some days. Would that your visit {{had been made}} on some more cheerful occasion." ...|$|R
60|$|LEO [springing up and flouncing {{round to}} him] Whats the matter! You may well ask. While Edie and Cecil {{were at the}} {{insurance}} office I took a taxy {{and went off to}} your lodgings; and a nice mess I found <b>everything</b> <b>in.</b> <b>Your</b> clothes are in a disgraceful state. Your liver pad has been made into a kettle-holder. Youre no more fit to be left to yourself than a one-year old baby.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{view from}} Morambala is extensive, but cheerless past description. Swamp, swamp-reeking, festering, rotting, malaria-pregnant swamp, where {{poisonous}} vapours {{for several months}} in the year are ever bulging up {{and out into the}} air,--lies before you {{as far as the eye}} can reach, and farther. If you enter the river at the worst seasons of the year, the chances are you will take the worst type of fever. If, on the other hand, you enter it during the best season, when the swamps are fairly dried up, you have <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> favour." ...|$|E
6000|$|Observe, on {{the other}} hand, that however white an object may be, there is always some small point of it whiter than the rest. You must {{therefore}} have a slight tone of grey over <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> picture except on the extreme high lights; even the piece of white paper, in your subject, must be toned slightly down, unless (and there are a thousand chances to one against its being so) it should all be turned so as fully to front the light. By examining {{the treatment of the}} white objects in any pictures accessible to you by Paul Veronese or Titian, you will soon understand this.[213] ...|$|E
60|$|Duen. I {{tell you}} again, I {{have no doubt}} on't; {{but it must be}} {{instantly}} put to the trial. <b>Everything</b> is prepared <b>in</b> <b>your</b> room, and for the rest we must trust to fortune.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} that would do very well; {{they would not be}} likely to notice him very particularly, and {{probably}} the General would not have spoken at all. He would just have seen his friend sign the deed, and then have affixed his own signature as a witness. Well, <b>everything</b> seems <b>in</b> <b>your</b> favor, and should you need any help you can rely upon me." ...|$|R
5000|$|This means a {{time before}} you knew right from wrong, when <b>everything</b> was correct <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life and your world, and that {{a time before}} you knew sin and the fall of man. When was that time? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A great deal," [...] Dr. Hodges said, {{in a tone}} of the {{greatest}} pleasure. [...] "Thank God, my lad, it is dying out. Not above three or four times since the Plague began have I been able to say so. I shall go about my work with a lighter heart today, and shall order your treatment in every case where I see the least chance of its being carried out, but I cannot hope that it will often prove as successful as it has with you. You have had <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> favour--youth, a good constitution, a tranquil mind, an absence of fear, and a faith in God." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have had}} <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> favour. There {{has been just}} enough breeze to take us along at a fair rate with all our light canvas set, and yet not enough to cause more than a ripple on the sea. The ship has been as steady as if in port; but you must not flatter {{yourself}} {{this is going to}} last all the time. I think we shall have a change before long. The glass has fallen a little, and the wind has shifted its quarter two or three times during the day. The sky, too, does not look so settled as it has done. I think we shall have a blow before long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Spontaneous!' he cried. 'You and spontaneity! You, {{the most}} {{deliberate}} {{thing that ever}} walked or crawled! You'd be verily deliberately spontaneous--that's you. Because {{you want to have}} <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> own volition, your deliberate voluntary consciousness. You want it all in that loathsome little skull of yours, that ought to be cracked like a nut. For you'll be the same till it is cracked, like an insect in its skin. If one cracked your skull perhaps one might get a spontaneous, passionate woman out of you, with real sensuality. As it is, what you want is pornography--looking at yourself in mirrors, watching your naked animal actions in mirrors, so that you can have it all in your consciousness, make it all mental.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I’m {{just taking}} things {{to a new}} place as far as music goes. I don’t {{want to go to}} the same route that I was going to before so far as how {{everything}} sounds, how <b>everything</b> sits <b>in</b> <b>your</b> ears... I’m going back to the roots of R&B, mid-’90s, from hearing a Timbaland record, an Aaliyah, something from Blackground Music, for example. When the music had so much emotion." ...|$|R
5000|$|Teacher Ho sums up {{the style}} when he gives Lung some advice, [...] "be calm and be gentle, with a supple waist. Steps must be light, as though {{slightly}} drunk. All movements smooth, no rigid muscles, <b>everything</b> relaxed... <b>in</b> particular <b>your</b> hands. Don't forget the secret is its deceptiveness." ...|$|R
2500|$|The measure, {{which came}} into effect on January 2, 2009, has clear {{differences}} with the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). There is a tax deduction for contributions to an RRSP, and withdrawals of contributions and investment income are all taxable. In contrast, there are no tax deductions for contributions to a TFSA. Beginning in 2013, contribution room in the TFSA has increased to $5,500 per calendar year.

6000|$|... "It is very necessary, Mr. Moore," [...] she said, [...] "that you do <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> {{power to}} {{discourage}} this tendency in Jack, he--"; {{but she got}} no further. A loud [...] "Whoop!" [...] {{from the direction of}} the window brought them both to their feet. The room was upon the second floor of the house, and opposite the window to which their attention had been attracted was a large tree, a branch of which spread to within a few feet of the sill. Upon this branch now they both discovered the subject of their recent conversation, a tall, well-built boy, balancing with ease upon the bending limb and uttering loud shouts of glee as he noted the terrified expressions upon the faces of his audience.|$|E
6000|$|Sir,--I have a {{good while}} had a wish to trouble you with a letter, and had {{certainly}} done it long ere now, but for a humiliating something that throws cold water on the resolution, as if one should say, [...] "You have found Mr. Graham a very powerful and kind friend indeed, and that interest he is so kindly taking in your concerns, you ought by <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> power to keep alive and cherish." [...] Now, though since God has thought proper to make one powerful and another helpless, the connection of obliger and obliged is all fair; and though my being under your patronage is to me highly honourable, yet, Sir, allow me to flatter myself that,--as a poet and an honest man you first interested yourself in my welfare, and principally as such still, you permit me to approach you.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Mr. Torrance, Harold," [...] said Mr. Compton as they entered. [...] "Mr. Bince, Mr. Torrance. Mr. Torrance {{is going}} to help us systematize the plant. He will report {{directly}} to me and I know you will do <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> power to help him. You can go to Mr. Bince for anything in the way of information you require, and Harold, when Mr. Torrance comes Thursday I wish you would introduce him to Everett and the various department heads and explain that they are to give him full cooperation. And now, as I have an appointment, I shall have to ask you to excuse me. I will see you Thursday. If there are any questions you want to ask, Mr. Bince will be glad to give you any information you wish or care for." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{interface}} {{is similar}} to other video editing software such as Windows Movie Maker, Nickelodeon's 3D Movie Maker, Source Filmmaker and Sony Vegas. On the top left hand corner of the screen is where you can add movements, actions, and dialogue for your movie, as well as change your options, such as video player size and turning off Plankton's help. On the top right hand corner of the screen is the Cartoon Movie Window. It shows <b>everything</b> used <b>in</b> <b>your</b> movie, such as the characters, props, and visual effects. On {{the bottom of the}} screen, there's three different things you see.|$|R

2500|$|.....If you say 'No,' if at {{the last}} moment you are no longer willing to listen to disinterested counsels. then... you will be {{relieved}} forever from my future... and nothing will remain to me but the consciousness that whatever may happen, I shall be able to say honestly to Rudolf one day; [...] "I did <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> my power. <b>Your</b> misfortunes are not on my conscience." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not 'with' us, if you {{object to}} that, but {{near enough to}} us, somewhere, {{for us to see}} you--well," [...] she beautifully brought out, [...] "when we feel we MUST. How shall we not {{sometimes}} feel it? I've wanted to see you often when I couldn't," [...] she pursued, [...] "all these last weeks. How shan't I then miss you now, with the sense of your being gone forever?" [...] Then as if the straightness of this appeal, taking him unprepared, had visibly left him wondering: [...] "Where IS your 'home' moreover now--what has become of it? I've made a change in your life, I know I have; I've upset <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> mind as well; in your sense of--what shall I call it?--all the decencies and possibilities. It gives me a kind of detestation--" [...] She pulled up short.|$|E
60|$|Lisa rose to reply, and {{the eyes}} of Hunt and his companions were eagerly turned upon him, those of M'Lellan glaring like a basilisk's. He began by the usual {{expressions}} of friendship, and then proceeded to explain {{the object of his}} own party. Those persons, however, said he, pointing to Mr. Hunt and his companions, are of a different party, and are quite distinct in their views; but, added he, though we are separate parties, we make but one common cause when the safety of either is concerned. Any injury or insult offered to them I shall consider as done to myself, and will resent it accordingly. I trust, therefore, that you will treat them with the same friendship that you have always manifested for me, doing <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> power to serve them and to help them on their way. The speech of Lisa, delivered with an air of frankness and sincerity, agreeably surprised and disappointed the rival party.|$|E
6000|$|If Carol {{was writing}} {{a letter to a}} classmate, or {{planning}} the week's menus, she could be certain that Aunt Bessie would pop in and titter, [...] "Now don't let me disturb you, I just wanted to see where you were, don't stop, I'm not going to stay only a second. I just wondered if you could possibly have thought that I didn't eat the onions this noon because I didn't think they were properly cooked, but that wasn't the reason at all, it wasn't because I didn't think they were well cooked, I'm sure that <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> house is always very dainty and nice, though I do think that Oscarina is careless about some things, she doesn't appreciate the big wages you pay her, and she is so cranky, all these Swedes are so cranky, I don't really see why you have a Swede, but----But that wasn't it, I didn't eat them not because I didn't think they weren't cooked proper, it was just--I find that onions don't agree with me, it's very strange, ever since I had an attack of biliousness one time, I have found that onions, either fried onions or raw ones, and Whittier does love raw onions with vinegar and sugar on them----" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{answer to}} the {{addresses}} of the Houses of Parliament of Ireland, your Majesty was most graciously pleased to assure them, [...] "That if any abuses had been committed by the patentee, you would give the necessary orders for enquiring into and punishing those abuses; and that your Majesty would do <b>everything,</b> that was <b>in</b> <b>your</b> power, for the satisfaction of your people." ...|$|R
6000|$|But again Mr. Bulstrode did {{not answer}} immediately, and she continued, [...] "It's not a time to spare when people are at death's door, nor would you wish it, sir, I'm sure.

500|$|When Akon {{was asked}} to work with Stefani, he {{reviewed}} her work, ranging from her music with No Doubt to her solo career. He noted that the sound Stefani had cultivated with No Doubt was missing from her solo work. Stefani, preoccupied with her baby Kingston Rossdale, cancelled their session and commented that she [...] "didn't {{want to go through}} the pain of trying to work with someone [...] didn't know". Iovine called Stefani, telling her, [...] "You can cancel <b>everything</b> else <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life, but don't cancel this session." [...] She decided to work with Akon and expected that they would work on writing a write a generic hip hop song, one that would not fit her well.|$|R
