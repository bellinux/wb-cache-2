Following its incorporation, the library was relocated from Literary Hall to two rear adjoining rooms on the second story of the Hampshire County Courthouse. The association continued to house its library collection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> until 1967, when the new Hampshire County Public Library building at 153West Main Street was formally dedicated on September 28, 1967. The library had been built on land donated by sisters Kate and Mary Davis, who had been engaged in the restoration of Literary Hall and whose father, Charles Maurice Davis, {{had been a member of}} both the Romney Literary Society and the Clinton Lodge Masons, which had both held meetings in the building.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{restoring}} the courthouse had been proposed {{even before it}} fell into disuse. In 1961, the architectural modelist Theodore Conrad proposed converting the building into a new city hall for Jersey City. The plan would have created a mall {{in front of the}} building and surrounded it with additional city buildings and a museum. Another proposal would house a branch of the New Jersey State Museum in the building. Conrad led a citizens group that lobbied for the preservation of the building, and got it listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The award-winning restoration project resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> being reopened in 1985 for the use of the civil courts and other county offices.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} again {{served as}} a library in March 1937, when Romney's community library was relocated {{to the first floor}} of Literary Hall from its previous facility {{in the basement of the}} Hampshire County Courthouse. The library had been established on April 11, 1935 as a project by the American Legion Auxiliary, and was housed in a room of the courthouse basement where it was staffed by volunteers and open from 2pm to 4pm on Saturday afternoons. When the library's collection of both purchased and donated books outgrew its space <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> basement, the Clinton Lodge Masons granted permission to the library to house its collection at Literary Hall in 1937. Following its move to Literary Hall, the library expanded its hours, and expanded them again, to five afternoons a week, through the assistance of the National Youth Administration and the Works Progress Administration.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, when Winchester was {{no longer}} a safe {{location}} for the storage of Hampshire County's records and they again risked destruction by Union Army forces, White's son Captain Christian Streit White took responsibility for the records and transferred them to Front Royal.

In the fall of 1864, the county's record books were rescued by Captain White and his company as Union Army troops {{were in the process of}} destroying them. Captain White's company loaded about 150 record books into a wagon, and they were taken to North Carolina where they remained safely for the duration of the war. Hampshire County's land records survived and were returned to the courthouse following the conclusion of the American Civil War, likely by a soldier returning to the area from North Carolina.
