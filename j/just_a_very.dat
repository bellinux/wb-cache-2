5|$|Osborn and Mook, in 1921, {{provisionally}} synonymized {{the three}} species, sinking A. latus into Camarasaurus supremus, and suggesting also that A. fragillimus is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large individual of A. altus, a position which most subsequent studies, including McIntosh 1998, Foster (2007), and Woodruff and Foster (2015) have agreed with. Carpenter (2006) disagreed about the synonymy of A. altus and A. fragillimus, however, citing numerous {{differences in the}} construction of the vertebra also noted by Cope, and suggested these differences are enough to warrant a separate species or even a separate genus for A. fragillimus. However, he went on to caution that the validity of A. fragillimus as a separate species is nearly impossible to determine without the original specimen to study. Although Amphicoelias latus is clearly not Amphicoelias, it is probably synonymous with Camarasaurus grandis rather than C. supremus because it was found lower in the Morrison Formation and the deeply concave articular faces on the caudal vertebrae are more consistent with C. grandis.|$|E

[...] According to defenceman Nicklas Lidström, [...] "He's one of those snipers that can put the puck on net because he finds openings and he knows where {{to be on the}} ice. Former teammate Jean-Sébastien Giguère added, [...] "He's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> elegant player.

500|$|Andrew Billen of The Times {{described}} the documentary as [...] "a crash-course sentimental education" [...] and [...] "a rush job". He said {{that rather than}} highlight the crime of trafficking, [...] "the spotlight was effectively turned on Lohan and under it she wilted". In a review in The Times, Caitlin Moran wrote that the juxtaposition of Lohan with the human suffering of trafficking made for [...] "an odd, disconcerting programme". Alice-Azania Jarvis of The Independent found the documentary [...] "very well put-together, very thoroughly researched, and very compelling" [...] {{and she said that}} the inclusion of Lohan was [...] "definitely not a terrible choice. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>very,</b> very odd one." ...|$|E

Turner comments, [...] "Homer is carrying the full symbolic weight of twentieth-century America on his shoulders, and no garden-variety doofus could manage that task." [...] Turner discusses a moment from the episode where Marge tells her sisters, [...] "Homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> complicated man", after which Homer breaks a plate {{over his head and}} shouts [...] "Wrong!" [...] Turner writes that this [...] "revelatory moment" [...] is illustrative of [...] "several of the best-known aspects of Homer's character: his impulsiveness, his inherent silliness, his evident, even physical stupidity".|$|E

500|$|A common {{claim by}} critics of Entertainment Weekly, IGN, SyFy Portal, AOL's TV Squad and BuddyTV was that more was learned about {{supporting}} player Ben, instead of Juliet who was centered on in flashbacks. [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly praised Emerson's acting {{and stated that}} [...] "in the end, this was really a story about Ben and the lengths he will go to protect himself and the Island from his enemies." [...] SyFy Portal's Dan Compora said that [...] "The more I hate Ben, the more I realize that Michael Emerson is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> fine actor doing his job." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called Emerson an acting [...] "god" [...] and said that [...] "The Other Woman" [...] was [...] "ostensibly a Juliet episode, [...] Ben's presence made a far bigger impression on me".

500|$|When {{asked if}} the 1995 thriller film Seven was an {{inspiration}} to Saw, Whannell said [...] "For me as the writer, definitely. I mean, Seven is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> well constructed film, and if you're writing a thriller, it can't hurt to study it. In terms of the story though, James and I never really felt Seven was that close to our film. I guess if you stand back, you have two detectives chasing a psychopath, who uses vile methods to teach people lessons, and those points echo Seven. What we always liked about Saw, though, {{was the fact that}} the story is told from the point of view of two of the psychopath's victims, instead of the police chasing after him, as you so often see." [...] Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman compared the plot to Seven saying, [...] "In a blatant imitation of Seven, Saw features a lunatic sadist whose ghoulish crimes are meant, in each case, to mirror the sins of his victims. The twist here is that the psycho doesn't do the killing." [...] Richard J. Leskosky of Champaign-Urbana's The News-Gazette said [...] "Saw wants to be taken as another Seven. Though it features perverse gross-out scenes and a villain with a superficially pedantic motive behind his crimes (his victims, if they survive, have learned to appreciate life more), it lacks the finesse and polish of the David Fincher film." ...|$|E
500|$|Aubry D'Arminio of Entertainment Weekly {{describes}} [...] "savvy Ben" [...] as a [...] "captivating minor character". [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly praised Emerson's {{acting in}} the beginning of season four, calling him [...] "a genius in [...] role". Alan Sepinwall from The Star-Ledger worried [...] "the actor is so good and the character so popular that he's kept alive even though it makes all the heroes look like idiots". Following [...] "Confirmed Dead", Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen felt [...] "Isn't the whole business of Ben manipulating Locke with the promise of Island secrets getting just a little bit old?" [...] SyFy Portal's Dan Compora said that [...] "The more I hate Ben, the more I realize that Michael Emerson is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> fine actor doing his job". Don Williams of BuddyTV said [...] "consider my mind blown again", referring to the flashforward in [...] "The Economist" [...] where it is revealed that Sayid is working for Ben. Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called Emerson an acting [...] "god". Chris Carabott from IGN found one of the best moments of [...] "Eggtown", was the power struggle between Locke and Ben, because [...] "Their scenes together are amongst the best in the series and the one that opens [...] "Eggtown" [...] is a perfect display of how well Michael Emerson and Terry O'Quinn work together. O'Quinn captures Locke's uncertainty perfectly in the opening scene and it's always fun to watch Ben prey on any weakness of character." [...] Kevin Thompson of The Palm Beach Post wrote [...] "with those big ol' eyes of his, [...] could always say more with a lengthy stare than he could with twenty pages of dialogue.... once again, proved why he has become Losts star as well as its heart and soul.... an Emmy should belong to [...]" [...] Jennifer Godwin of E! wrote that [...] "no one has ever done better work humanizing a supervillain." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide puts Ben in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] in the top 20 moments of the week, stating [...] "Michael Emerson on Lost. It doesn't get better than that". Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy describes Emerson's performance as [...] "fantastic", with [...] "many layers of intrigue and humanity". John Kubicek of BuddyTV also found his performance [...] "fantastic", adding [...] "he nailed it". Critic Kelly Woo, from TV Squad, placed him on second on her list of [...] "Seven new characters that worked", ranking just below Desmond Hume, also from Lost.|$|E

[...] The 1979 Three Mile Island accident inspired Charles Perrow's book Normal Accidents, where a nuclear accident occurs, resulting from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system. TMI was an example of a normal accident because it was [...] "unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable".|$|E

2500|$|Parks {{rendered}} crucial {{assistance in}} the first campaign for Congress by John Conyers. She persuaded Martin Luther King (who was generally reluctant to endorse local candidates) to appear with Conyers, thereby boosting the novice candidate's profile. When Conyers was elected, he hired her as a secretary and receptionist for his congressional office in Detroit. She held this position until she retired in 1988. In a telephone interview with CNN on October 24, 2005, Conyers recalled, [...] "You treated her with deference {{because she was so}} quiet, so serene— <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> special person... There was only one Rosa Parks." [...] Doing much of the daily constituent work for Conyers, Parks often focused on socio-economic issues including welfare, education, job discrimination, and affordable housing. She visited schools, hospitals, senior citizen facilities, and other community meetings and kept Conyers grounded in community concerns and activism.|$|E

[...] The proposals of liberal UAW leaders such as Walter Reuther for urban redevelopment did not please the UAW's largely white, conservative membership. The members repeatedly voted for conservative mayoral candidates, such as Republicans Albert Cobo (mayor 1950-57) and Louis Miriani (mayor 1957-62), for they protected white neighborhoods from residential integration. Home ownership was not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large financial investment for individuals, it was also a source of identity for men who remembered the hardships and foreclosures of the Great Depression.
