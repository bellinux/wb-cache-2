40|$|A <b>firm's</b> <b>capacity</b> {{to enter}} and sell {{products}} in international markets requires an important degree of competitiveness, which fundamentally resides in its intangible resources. Thus, in the current work and drawing from the resource-based view of the firm, we analyse {{the influence of a}} <b>firm's</b> technological <b>capacity</b> on both its decision to export and its export intensity from a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms using non-linear regression models. Our findings show that product innovations, patents and process innovations positively and significantly affect both the decision to export and the export intensity.

40|$|Since service {{production}} and consumption are inseparable, many service <b>firms</b> sell their <b>capacity</b> in advance. This paper examines the optimality and practice of advanced sale of service capacity under duopolistic competition. Using a game-theoretic approach, it attempts to explain why, despite sophisticated practices of advanced sale in many service industries, many service firms still do not sell in advance. It demonstrates that competition and market price sensitivity to a <b>firm's</b> <b>capacity</b> can impact not only a firm's decision to sell in advance, but also its pricing and capacity allocation decisions. services; yield management; competitive strategy; game theory; advanced sale; service capacity; competition; market price; pricing; capacity allocation. ...|$|R

40|$|In 1992, the U. S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission {{created a}} {{secondary}} market {{for natural gas}} transportation whereby shippers holding <b>firm</b> transportation <b>capacity</b> on interstate natural gas pipelines can compete with the pipeline {{in the provision of}} transportation services. However, if a shipper does not use some of its contracted <b>firm</b> transportation <b>capacity,</b> the pipeline can resell that capacity as interruptible transportation. That is, the pipeline has residual rights with respect to <b>firm</b> transportation <b>capacity</b> contracted for by shippers. We demonstrate that these residual rights can {{have a significant effect on}} the competitiveness of the secondary market for natural gas transportation. A consequence of these residual rights is that the secondary market for natural gas transportation may be considerably more competitive than indicated by measures of concentration like the widely used Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{employs a}} simple model to {{describe}} bidding behavior in multi-unit uniform price procurement auctions when <b>firms</b> are <b>capacity</b> constrained. Using {{data from the}} New York City capacity auctions, I find that <b>capacity</b> constrained <b>firms</b> use simple bidding strategies to co-ordinate on an equilibrium that extracts high rents for all bidders. I show theoretically and empirically that the largest bidder submits the auction clearing bid. All other bidders submit infra-marginal bids that are low enough to not be profitably undercut. Infra-marginal bidders react to capacity endowments and decrease their bids as the largest <b>firm’s</b> <b>capacities</b> and its profits of undercutting increase. Capacity markets, when designed as studied here, are a costly tool to increase security of supply in electricity markets, as capacity prices do not reflect actual capacity scarcity...|$|R

Competences must be constantly adjusted for relevance. Kjell Grønhaug and Odd Nordhaug discuss firms' core competences, their competence requirements and gaps.

50|$|The {{short to}} medium term {{generation}} plans included the use of renewable resources, including 4MW from a Wind Farm and 10MW from a Bagasse co-generation facility.

According to GPL's annual report 2006, the inability to conclude Power Purchase Agreements for the Wind Farm and 35MW of heavy fuel oil-fired capacity meant that the entire generation plan had to be rolled forward into the 2007-2011 Development & Expansion Programme.|$|E

They pointed out that coal-fired power plants are typically available 87.5 % of the time, after accounting for scheduled maintenance and unscheduled maintenance or outages.
