40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to analyze {{delinquency}} risk factors because this risk component contributed the biggest loss portion in the credit card business in Indonesia. Based on the analysis results, the delinquency risk module prototype would be developed as an enhancement of the existing credit card system using Scoring ware method. Data definition in the Scoring ware based on passed facts that create delinquency risks as the benchmark. The target of this enhancement is the customer profile and transaction authorization processing. Scoring ware results used two system concepts in Information System, that which only create supporting data (Decision Support System-DSS) and that which directly made up decision (Expert System-ES). Customer Profile Scoring ware would behave as a DSS while the customer profile score was in the <b>judgment</b> <b>rating</b> range, but it would behave as an ES while the score over the minimum rating or below the declined rating. Suspected Transaction Scoring ware always behave as an ES, because one transaction must be approved or declined in the response time limit based on the Transaction Anomaly Symptoms. Functional independence enhancement, low investments and minimum management changes were the considerations {{for the implementation of}} Scoring ware module prototype in order to minimize delinquency risk losses. The succeeds of the implementation processes were defamed by precise benchmark customer profiles and transactions, user requirement satisfied, cut off strategy and synergy of the implementation team. ...|$|E

This was a research and development (R & D) study. The subjects were Grade VIII students of SMP Negeri 2 Mertoyudan Class VIII A that consisted of 16 female and 15 male students. This research was conducted by following Jolly and Bolithos’s model in Tomlinson (1998) with some modification. The first step was needs analysis done by distributing questionnaires to the students. The result of the needs analysis was the basis for developing a course grid. The course grid was used as the guideline to develop the first draft of the reading materials. The first draft was evaluated by an expert and then revised based on the feedback obtained from the evaluation. The instruments to collect the data were the needs analysis questionnaire and the expert <b>judgment</b> <b>rating</b> scale. The data from the needs analysis were analyzed quantitatively using frequency and percentage and the quantitative data obtained from the expert judgment were analyzed through descriptive statistics. The results of the needs analysis showed that the students needed materials for reading comprehension which were attractive and interesting and related to their daily life. Therefore, this study developed three units of materials which were implemented in the interactive multimedia. Each unit consists of Get Ready, Let’s Read, Let’s Do More, Let’s Reflect and Let’s Review activities with 16 tasks focusing on vocabulary building, grammar (the use of the simple present tense, adjectives and prepositions and text construction.

This was a research and development (R & D) study. The subjects were Grade VIII students of SMP N 6 Yogyakarta Classes VIII-E and VIII-F that consisted of 33 male students and 35 female students. The research procedure followed the theory proposed by Jolly and Bolitho in Tomlinson (1998) with some modifications. The steps were the exploration of needs, contextual realisation, pedagogical realisation, production of the materials, evaluation of the materials, and revision of the materials. The instruments to collect the data were the needs analysis questionnaire and the expert <b>judgment</b> <b>rating</b> scale. The data from the needs analysis were analyzed quantitatively using frequency and percentage and the quantitative data obtained from the expert judgment were analyzed through descriptive statistics. 		Based {{on the results of}} the needs analysis, the students wanted the topics that were related to daily activities. The conversation input that students preferred was pictures/photos. The conversation book presented a lot of information and explanation. The students wanted to learn vocabulary by spelling the words correctly.

40|$|Risk {{assessment}} scales (RASs) {{intended to}} identify patients {{most at risk}} of developing pressure ulcers {{have been widely used}} for many years. Numerous studies have evaluated their predictive validity but potential bias has been inherent in the design of all.

These findings were compared with nurses' clinical <b>judgment</b> <b>rated</b> on a visual analogue scale. The simulations consisted of high-resolution photographs accompanied by case studies of the patients. The nurses' scores were compared to estimates of risk generated by an expert panel. Nurses' clinical judgment agreed much more closely with expert opinion than any of the RASs. A replication study was undertaken to confirm these findings. One hundred and fifteen nurses participated in replication. Again the nurses' clinical judgment matched expert opinion much more closely than the results of the RASs. Replication also drew attention to a number of methodological issues which deserve consideration when using simulation to test the effectiveness of clinical tools and the need to establish adequate measures of external validity whenever use of this method is contemplated...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{predictive}} power of functional assessment for death and institutionalization with the clinical judgment of continuing care nurses; {{to determine the}} rates of functional impairment in elderly community-based continuing care clients; to describe long-term group trends in this population. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study, which lasted 4 years. SETTING: Community-based continuing care nursing program. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirty-seven elderly (65 years or older) clients of the program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Activities of daily living (ADL), cognitive function, and affective function were assessed when clients entered the program (using the Barthel Index, the Canadian Mental Status Questionnaire, and the Memorial University Scale of Happiness). Home care nurses were asked to predict whether individual clients would have died or {{dropped out of the}} program at 1 year after entry. RESULTS: Cognitive function and ADL function tests were significant predictors of both death and drop-out from the program; they were better than clinical <b>judgment.</b> <b>Rates</b> of cognitive and ADL functioning were as expected; the rate of affective impairment (53. 6 %) was much higher than anticipated.
