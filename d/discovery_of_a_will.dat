"SIR,--I {{think you}} have {{suffered}} enough for faults which, I believe, do not lie with you, so much as your wife; and I have withdrawn my claims which I had against you {{while you were in}} wrongful possession of my father's estates. You must remember that when, on examination of my father's papers, no will was found, I yielded up his property, with perfect willingness, to those who I fancied were his legitimate heirs. For this I received all sorts of insults from your wife and yourself (who acquiesced in them); and when the <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>will,</b> in India, proved MY just claims, you must remember how they were met, and the vexatious proceedings with which you sought to oppose them.|$|E
60|$|On {{the morning}} train from Catania arrived Silas Watson {{and his young}} ward Kenneth Forbes, the boy who had so {{unexpectedly}} inherited Aunt Jane's fine estate of Elmhurst on her death. The <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>will</b> which gave to Kenneth all the property their aunt had intended for her nieces had not caused the slightest estrangement between the young folks, then or afterward. On the contrary, the girls were all glad that the gloomy, neglected boy, with his artistic, high-strung temperament, would be so well provided for. Without the inheritance {{he would have been}} an outcast; now he was able to travel with his guardian, the kindly old Elmhurst lawyer, and fit himself for his future important position in the world. More than all this, however, Kenneth had resolved to be a great landscape painter, and Italy and Sicily had done much, in the past year, to prepare him for this career.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the late}} 15th century, Cretan artists had {{established}} a distinct icon-painting style, distinguished by [...] "the precise outlines, the modelling of the flesh with dark brown underpaint and dense tiny highlights on the cheeks of the faces, the bright colours in the garments, the geometrical treatment of the drapery, and, finally the balanced articulation of the composition", or [...] "sharp contours, slim silhouettes, linear draperies and restrained movements". [...] The most famous artist of the period was Andreas Ritzos(c. 1421-1492), whose son Nicholas was also well known. Angelos Akotantos, until recently {{thought to be a}} conservative painter of the 17th century, is now, after the <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>will</b> dated 1436, seen to have been an innovative artist in fusing Byzantine and Western styles, who survived until about 1457, when the will was actually registered. Interestingly, the will was made in anticipation of a voyage to Constantinople; several icons were bequeathed to church institutions, some Catholic but mainly Orthodox, and the disposition of his stock of pattern drawings was carefully specified. Andreas Pavias (d. after 1504) and his pupil Angelos Bizamanos, and Nicholas Tzafuris (d. before 1501) were other leading artists.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{evidence}} that at least 5 % of Multiple sclerosis (MS) cases manifest in childhood. Children with MS present with a demyelinating episode involving single or multiple symptoms prior to developing a second event (usually within two years) to then meet criteria for diagnosis. There {{is evidence}} from adult cohorts that the incidence and sex ratios of MS are changing and that children <b>of</b> immigrants have <b>a</b> higher risk for developing MS. A paediatric population should reflect the vanguard of such changes and may reflect trends yet to be observed in adult cohorts. Studying a paediatric population from the first demyelinating event {{will allow us to}} test these hypotheses, and may offer further valuable insights into the genetic and environmental interactions in the pathogenesis of MS. Methods/Design The Paediatric UK Demyelinating Disease Longitudinal Study (PUDDLS) is a prospective longitudinal observational study which aims to determine the natural history, predictors and outcomes of childhood CNS inflammatory demyelinating diseases. PUDDLS will involve centres in the UK, and <b>will</b> establish <b>a</b> cohort <b>of</b> children affected with a first CNS inflammatory demyelinating event for long-term follow up by recruiting for approximately 5 years. PUDDLS <b>will</b> also establish <b>a</b> biological sample archive (CSF, serum, and DNA), allowing future hypothesis driven research. For example, the future <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> biomarker <b>will</b> allow validation within this dataset for the evaluation of novel biomarkers. Patients will also be requested to consent to be contacted in the future. A secondary aim is to collaborate internationally with the International Paediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group when future collaborative studies are proposed, whilst sharing a minimal anonymised dataset. PUDDLS is the second of two jointly funded studies. The first (UCID-SS) is an epidemiological surveillance study that already received ethical approvals, and started on the 1 st September 2009. There is no direct patient involvement, and UCID-SS aims to determine the UK and Ireland incidence of CNS inflammatory demyelinating disorders in children under 16 years. Discussion A paediatric population should reflect the vanguard of MS epidemiological changes and may reflect trends yet to be observed in adult MS cohorts. The restricted window between clinical expression of disease and exposure to environmental factors in children offers a unique research opportunity. Studying a paediatric population from the first demyelinating event will allow us to investigate the changing epidemiology of MS, and may offer further valuable insights into the genetic and environmental interactions in the pathogenesis of MS. </p...|$|R
