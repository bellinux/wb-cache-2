5|$|The cantata {{was first}} {{published}} in 1864 in the Bach <b>Gesellschaft</b> first edition of the composer's complete works. It was published in the Neue Bach-Ausgabe in 1958, edited by Frederick Hudson.|$|E
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata on 22 December 1715 in the ducal chapel. He could not revive the work in Leipzig because tempus clausum was observed there during Advent. The cantata {{was first published in}} 1881 in the Bach <b>Gesellschaft</b> edition, edited by Wilhelm Rust.|$|E
5|$|Hassium {{was officially}} {{discovered}} in 1984 by a German research {{team led by}} Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research (<b>Gesellschaft</b> für Schwerionenforschung, GSI) in Darmstadt. The team bombarded a target of lead-208 with accelerated nuclei of iron-58 to produce 3atoms of the isotope hassium-265.|$|E
5|$|Some Bach {{scholars}} {{believed that}} the cantata was written in 1734 {{for the end of}} the War of the Polish Succession, but the discovery of the printed text showed that it was not related. The cantata was not published until 1876 when it appeared in the Bach <b>Gesellschaft</b> Ausgabe, the first complete edition of the composer's works.|$|E
5|$|The cantata was {{edited by}} Franz Wüllner for the Bach <b>Gesellschaft</b> Ausgabe, the first {{complete}} edition of Bach's works, in a volume published in 1887. The New Bach Edition (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, NBA) published the score {{of both the}} Weimar and the Leipzig version in 1982, edited by , with the critical commentary following in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The {{heaviest}} known group 12 element, copernicium, {{was first}} created on February 9, 1996, at the <b>Gesellschaft</b> für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, by Sigurd Hofmann, Victor Ninov et al. It was then officially {{named by the}} International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) after Nicolaus Copernicus on February 19, 2010, the 537th anniversary of Copernicus' birth.|$|E
5|$|A few letter {{fragments}} and documents relating to Accum still exist in his family's possession. A certificate from the <b>Gesellschaft</b> naturforschender Freunde (society of natural philosophical friends), based in Berlin and granting honorary membership to Accum, dated November 1, 1814, was made available online in 2006. A letter from Accum written in London and addressed {{to his brother}} Philipp in Bückeburg, about life in London {{after the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars, is also available online at Wikisource.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium {{was first}} created on February 9, 1996, at the <b>Gesellschaft</b> für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, by Sigurd Hofmann, Victor Ninov et al. This element {{was created by}} firing {{accelerated}} zinc-70 nuclei at a target made of lead-208 nuclei in a heavy ion accelerator. A single atom (a second was reported but {{was found to have}} been based on data fabricated by Ninov) of copernicium was produced with a mass number of 277.|$|E
5|$|Despite his partial {{recovery}} evident in America, Weber {{felt that he}} was unable to resume regular teaching at that time and continued on as a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907. In 1909, disappointed with the Verein, he co-founded the German Sociological Association (Deutsche <b>Gesellschaft</b> für Soziologie, or DGS) and served as its first treasurer. He would, however, resign from the DGS in 1912. In 1912, Weber tried to organise a left-wing political party to combine social-democrats and liberals. This attempt was unsuccessful, in part because many liberals feared social-democratic revolutionary ideals.|$|E
5|$|Franck {{became the}} Head of the Physics Division of the Kaiser Wilhelm <b>Gesellschaft</b> for Physical Chemistry. In 1920, Franck became {{professor}} ordinarius of experimental physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics at the University of Göttingen. While there {{he worked on}} quantum physics with Max Born, who was Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics. His work included the Franck–Hertz experiment, an important confirmation of the Bohr model of the atom. He promoted the careers of women in physics, notably Lise Meitner, Hertha Sponer and Hilde Levi.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Emmy Noether and Emil Artin {{received}} the Ackermann–Teubner Memorial Award {{for their contributions}} to mathematics. The prize carried a monetary reward of 500Reichsmarks and {{was seen as a}} long-overdue official recognition of her considerable work in the field. Nevertheless, her colleagues expressed frustration at {{the fact that she was}} not elected to the Göttingen <b>Gesellschaft</b> der Wissenschaften (academy of sciences) and was never promoted to the position of Ordentlicher Professor (full professor).|$|E
5|$|The cantata was {{published}} by Breitkopf & Härtel in 1888 in volume 35 of the first complete edition of Bach's works by the Bach <b>Gesellschaft,</b> edited by Alfred Dörffel. In the Neue Bach-Ausgabe, the second complete edition of Bach's works, in the historical-critical edition, Dietrich Kilian edited both the reconstructed Weimar version (1959) and the first Leipzig version (1960) in volume 13, adding the critical report in 1960.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a {{third major}} {{competitor}} joined {{the race for}} superheavy elements—the <b>Gesellschaft</b> für Schwerionenforschung (English: Society for Heavy Ion Research) in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany. They claimed to have synthesized the element 107; their report came out {{five years after the}} first report from Dubna did but provided a greater level of precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. The German team joined with the Soviet team in that it suggested the name nielsbohrium for the new element, believing Bohr did deserve an element named after him, and hoping to ease the tension on the element 105 controversy. The Soviet team did not hurry to suggest a new name for element 105, stating it was more important to first determine the discoverers of the element.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party {{reported}} on the discovery of copernicium and acknowledged {{the discovery of the}} isotope 283Cn. This implied the de facto discovery of the livermorium-291 isotope, from the acknowledgment of the data relating to its granddaughter 283Cn, although the livermorium data was not absolutely critical for the demonstration of copernicium's discovery. Also in 2009, confirmation from Berkeley and the <b>Gesellschaft</b> für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany came for the flerovium isotopes 286 to 289, immediate daughters of the four known livermorium isotopes. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 2000–2006. Whereas they found the earliest data (not involving 291Lv and 283Cn) inconclusive, the results of 2004–2006 were accepted as identification of livermorium, and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, the Joint Working Party (JWP) of IUPAC {{published}} {{a report on}} the discovery of copernicium in which they acknowledged the discovery of the isotope 283Cn. This implied the discovery of flerovium, from the acknowledgement of the data for the synthesis of 287Fl and 291Lv, which decay to 283Cn. The discovery of the isotopes flerovium-286 and -287 was confirmed in January 2009 at Berkeley. This was followed by confirmation of flerovium-288 and -289 in July 2009 at the <b>Gesellschaft</b> für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 1999–2007. They found the early data inconclusive, but accepted the results of 2004–2007 as flerovium, and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Nobel Prize. Franck was awarded the Max Planck Medal of the Deutsche Physikalische <b>Gesellschaft</b> in 1951 and the Rumford Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences {{for his work on}} photosynthesis in 1955. He became an honorary citizen of Göttingen in 1953, and was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1964. He died suddenly from a heart attack while visiting Göttingen on 21 May 1964, and was buried in Chicago with his first wife. In 1967, the University of Chicago named the James Franck Institute after him. A lunar crater has also been named in his honour. His papers are in the University of Chicago Library.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1923, he {{was hired}} by the Daimler Motoren <b>Gesellschaft</b> as a car {{salesman}} at their Dresden outlet. Caracciola continued racing, driving a Mercedes 6/25/40hp to victory in four of the eight races he entered in 1923. His success continued in 1924 with the new supercharged Mercedes 1.5-litre; he won 15races during the season, including the Klausenpass hillclimb in Switzerland. He attended the Italian Grand Prix at Monza as a reserve driver for Mercedes, but did not take part in the race. He drove his 1.5-litre to five victories in 1925, and won the hillclimbs at Kniebis and Freiburg in a Mercedes 24/100/140hp. With his racing career becoming increasingly successful, he abandoned his plans to study mechanical engineering.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} the Christmas hymns of the E-flat major version of Bach's Magnificat were printed {{was in the same}} volume as the D major version of the Magnificat, in the 1862 Bach <b>Gesellschaft</b> XI/1 publication, which {{presented}} the hymns in an annex. In that publication the hymns were however not transposed to fit in the D major setting of the Magnificat. More recently publishers offer such transposed (and completed) versions of the hymns, {{so that they can be}} performed as part of the D major version of the Magnificat, for instance Novello in 2000 (Neil Jenkins) and Bärenreiter in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of managing design {{to achieve a}} business objective was first documented in 1907. The Deutscher Werkbund (German Work Federation) was established in Munich by twelve architects and twelve business firms as a state-sponsored effort to better compete with Great Britain and the United States by integrating traditional craft and industrial mass-production techniques. A German designer and architect, Peter Behrens, created the entire corporate identity (logotype, product design, publicity, etc.) of Allgemeine Elektrizitäts <b>Gesellschaft</b> (AEG), and {{is regarded as the}} first industrial designer in history. His work for AEG was the first large-scale demonstration of the viability and vitality of the Werkbund's initiatives and objectives and can be considered as first contribution to design management.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen cyanide, {{discovered}} in the late 18th century, {{was used in the}} 1880s for the fumigation of citrus trees in California. Its use spread to other countries for the fumigation of silos, goods wagons, ships, and mills. Its light weight and rapid dispersal meant its application had to take place under tents or in enclosed areas. Research by Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry led to the founding in 1919 of Deutsche <b>Gesellschaft</b> für Schädlingsbekämpfung mbH (Degesch), a state-controlled consortium formed to investigate military use of the chemical. Chemists at Degesch added a cautionary eye irritant to a less volatile cyanide compound which reacted with water in the presence of heat to become hydrogen cyanide. The new product was marketed as the pesticide Zyklon (cyclone). As a similar formula had been used as a weapon by the Germans during World War I, Zyklon was soon banned.|$|E
5|$|The first {{sociology}} {{department to}} be established in the United Kingdom was at the London School of Economics and Political Science (home of the British Journal of Sociology) in 1904. Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse and Edvard Westermarck became the lecturers in the discipline at the University of London in 1907. Harriet Martineau, an English translator of Comte, has been cited as the first female sociologist. In 1909 the Deutsche <b>Gesellschaft</b> für Soziologie (German Sociological Association) was founded by Ferdinand Tönnies and Max Weber, among others. Weber established the first department in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1919, having presented an influential new antipositivist sociology. In 1920, Florian Znaniecki set up the first department in Poland. The Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt (later to become the Frankfurt School of critical theory) was founded in 1923. International co-operation in sociology began in 1893, when René Worms founded the , an institution later eclipsed by the much larger International Sociological Association (ISA), founded in 1949.|$|E
