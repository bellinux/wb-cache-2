25|$|Damages may be {{general or}} consequential. <b>General</b> <b>damages</b> are those damages which {{naturally}} flow from {{a breach of}} contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties {{at the time of}} contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. <b>General</b> <b>damages</b> would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently legal {{claims were}} made in the High Court with each claims arising from the {{problems}} which followed the establishment of the Brethren Church on Nanumaga. Four people from Nanumaga sued in relation to unlawful dismissal from their employment on grounds that included unlawful {{discrimination on the basis of}} religion and that their Constitutional right to freedom of belief, expression and association have been denied by the Falekaupule. Three claims were dismissed, with one plaintiff being awarded <b>general</b> <b>damages</b> and aggravated damages.|$|E
25|$|The two men briefly reunited in October 1951 to {{face charges}} {{that they had}} plagiarized Sunset Boulevard. Former Paramount {{accountant}} Stephanie Joan Carlson alleged that in 1947 she had submitted to Wilder and Brackett, at their request, manuscripts of stories, both fictional and based on fact, she had written about studio life. She claimed that one in particular, Past Performance, served {{as the basis for}} the Sunset script, and sued the screenwriters and Paramount for $100,000 in <b>general</b> <b>damages,</b> $250,000 in punitive damages, $700,000 based on the box office returns, and an additional $350,000 for good measure, for a total of $1,400,000. Carlson's suit was dismissed after two and a half years. In 1954, a similar suit was filed by playwright Edra Buckler, who claimed material she had written had been the screenplay's source. Her suit was dismissed the following year.|$|E
40|$|Inter-story drift {{ratio is}} a <b>general</b> <b>damage</b> index {{which is being}} used to detect damaged stories after severe ground motions. Since this <b>general</b> <b>damage</b> index cannot detect damaged {{elements}} also the severity of imposed damages on elements, a new real-time seismic damage detection method base on artificial neural networks was proposed to overcome this issue. This approach considers nonlinear behaviour of structures and not only is capable of detecting damaged elements but also can address the severity of imposed damages. Proposed algorithm was applied on a 3 -story concrete building. The obtained results confirmed accuracy and robustness of this method...|$|R
50|$|<b>General</b> <b>damage</b> {{for pain}} and suffering, and punitive damages for {{employer}} negligence, {{are generally not}} available in workers' compensation plans, and negligence is generally not {{an issue in the}} case.

50|$|Damages are {{categorized}} as either special or general. In torts, special damages are measurable costs {{which can be}} itemized such as medical expenses, lost earnings, and property damages whereas <b>general</b> <b>damages</b> include less measurable costs such as pain and suffering, loss of consortium, the effects of defamation, and emotional distress.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{the basic principles}} of a <b>general</b> <b>damage</b> computational approach for laminates and demonstrates this approach's prediction capabilities in simulating the complete fracture phenomenon in the case of several tests, both with and without delamination. In this paper, the Damage Mechanics approach is applied in order to solve delamination problems, such as the propagation of an initiated crack, the onset of delamination near edges, and the growth of delamination around holes. For the M 55 J/M 18 carbon/epoxy material, numerical simulations are presented and then compared with experimental results. Pierre Ladevze, Olivier Allix, Bernard Douchin, and David Lvque 2 1. INTRODUCTION This study concerns a <b>general</b> <b>damage</b> computational approach for laminated structures which is able to predict, at any time and at any point, the "intensities" of the various damage mechanisms up to fracture.

50|$|Intimidation {{can also}} be a civil offense, in {{addition}} to a criminal offense, in some U.S. states.

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out to {{investigate}} the DNA base specificity of light-induced banding (LIB) produced by photo-oxidation of chromosomes followed by Quinacrine staining to detect denatured DNA. In the present study mitotic preparations from Sarcophaga ruficornis and Sarcophaga argyrostoma were used to detect the visible light and fluorochrome interactions. Our results indicated that specific destruction of guanine residues is the main effect of photo-oxidation and LIB is a base-specific phenomenon. In addition, photo-oxidation may also cause DNA-protein cross-linking which affects the binding of some dyes, while prolonged photo-oxidation appears to cause more <b>general</b> <b>damage</b> to DNA...|$|R
