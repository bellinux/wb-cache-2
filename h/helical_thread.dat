40|$|Fine-structure {{dynamics}} in solar prominences holds critical clues to understanding their physical nature of significant space-weather implications. We report evidence of rotational motions of horizontal <b>helical</b> <b>threads</b> in two active-region prominences observed by the Hinode and/or IRIS satellites at high resolution. In the first event, we found transverse motions of brightening threads at {{speeds up to}} 55 km s^- 1 seen in {{the plane of the}} sky. Such motions appeared as sinusoidal space [...] time trajectories with a typical period of ∼ 390 s, which is consistent with plane-of-sky projections of rotational motions. Phase delays at different locations suggest propagation of twists along the threads at phase speeds of 90 [...] 270 km s^- 1. At least 15 episodes of such motions occurred in two days, none associated with any eruption. For these episodes, the plane-of-sky speed is linearly correlated with the vertical travel distance, suggestive of a constant angular speed. In the second event, we found Doppler velocities of 30 [...] 40 km s^- 1 in opposite directions in the top and bottom portions of the prominence, comparable to the plane-of-sky speed. The moving threads have about twice broader line widths than stationary threads. These observations, when taken together, provide strong evidence for rotations of <b>helical</b> prominence <b>threads,</b> which were likely driven by unwinding twists triggered by magnetic reconnection between twisted prominence magnetic fields and ambient coronal fields.

50|$|Typically, an {{electric}} motor is mechanically connected to rotate a lead screw. A lead screw has a continuous <b>helical</b> <b>thread</b> machined on its circumference running along the length (similar to the thread on a bolt). Threaded onto the lead screw is a lead nut or ball nut with corresponding helical threads. The nut is prevented from rotating with the lead screw (typically the nut interlocks with a non-rotating part of the actuator body). Therefore, when the lead screw is rotated, the nut will be driven along the threads. The direction of motion of the nut depends on the direction of rotation of the lead screw. By connecting linkages to the nut, the motion {{can be converted to}} usable linear displacement. Most current actuators are built for high speed, high force, or a compromise between the two. When considering an actuator for a particular application, the most important specifications are typically travel, speed, force, accuracy, and lifetime. Most varieties are mounted on dampers or butterfly valves.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} that a simple stirred batch cell can be used to study the effects of surface shear stress (among other process parameters) on fouling from saturated calcium salt solutions.

The raised helical surface was more effective in reducing fouling than the helical groove. The results confirm the general effect that fouling rates can be reduced by increasing the surface shear stress through surface enhancement. A simple mathematical model has been developed to take into account the dynamic change in bulk concentration as crystallization fouling occurs. In all cases, the overall fouling resistance increased asymptotically toward a constant value and could easily and accurately be described quantitatively by the new analytical model. The variations of shear stresses on the various surfaces were determined from computational fluid dynamics simulations using the commercial package Comsol 4. 2...|$|R

40|$|One {{main goal}} of the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) which {{is located at the}} Fuxian Solar Observatory is to image the Sun at high resolution. Based on the high spatial and {{temporal}} resolution NVST Hα data and combined with the simultaneous observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory for the first time, we investigate a flux rope tracked by a filament activation. The filament material is initially located {{at one end of the}} flux rope and fills in a section of the rope, and then the filament is activated due to magnetic field cancellation. The activated filament rises and flows along <b>helical</b> <b>threads,</b> tracking out the twisted flux rope structure. The length of the flux rope is about 75 Mm, the average width of its individual threads is 1. 11 Mm, and the estimated twist is 1 π. The flux rope appears as a dark structure in Hα images, a partial dark and partial bright structure in 304 Å, while as bright structures in 171 Å and 131 Å images. During this process, the overlying coronal loops are quite steady since the filament is confined within the flux rope and does not erupt successfully. It seems that, for the event in this study, the filament is located and confined within the flux rope threads, instead of being suspended in the dips of twisted magnetic flux.

Boiling in dilute acid destroys the associated collagen {{but does not}} obviously alter the elastic tissue. Digestion in crystalline trypsin of either boiled or unheated tissue {{from any of the}} above-mentioned sources causes the release of thin threads ranging in length from 0. 1 µ to many microns. A large proportion of these threads are evenly and tightly coiled double helices formed from at least two interlacing filaments and measuring about 120 A in width. The distance between coils ranges from about 470 to 590 A. The individual smooth filaments, many of which are present in parallel pairs, measure approximately 70 A in width. Raising the pH of a neutral suspension of threads from ligamentum nuchae lowers the ratio of <b>helical</b> <b>threads</b> to uncoiled filaments, whereas lowering the pH with acetic acid results in clumping of threads with complete loss of identity at about pH 3. 6. Threads and filaments obtained from all sources studied were destroyed in the temperature range 75 – 85 °C. at pH 7. It is concluded that the elastic fiber is a two component system composed of bundles of trypsin-resistant threads of characteristic form and size plus a trypsin-sensitive, heat-resistant "amorphous" binding matrix.

40|$|We {{report a}} chromospheric jet lasting {{for more than}} 1 hr {{observed}} by Hinode Solar Optical Telescope in unprecedented detail. The ejection occurred in three episodes separated by 12 - 14 min, with the amount and velocity of material decreasing with time. The upward velocities range from 438 to 33 km/s, while the downward velocities of the material falling back have smaller values (mean: - 56 km/s) and a narrower distribution (standard deviation: 14 km/s). The average acceleration inferred from parabolic space-time tracks is 141 m/s^ 2, {{a fraction of the}} solar gravitational acceleration. The jet consists of fine threads (0. 5 - 2. 0 arcsec wide), which exhibit coherent, oscillatory transverse motions perpendicular to the jet axis and about a common equilibrium position. These motions propagate upward along the jet, with the maximum phase speed of 744 +/- 11 km/s at the leading front of the jet. The transverse oscillation velocities range from 151 to 26 km/s, amplitudes from 6. 0 to 1. 9 Mm, and periods from 250 to 536 s. The oscillations slow down with time and cease when the material starts to fall back. The falling material travels along almost straight lines in the original direction of ascent, showing no transverse motions.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} flux rope (MFR) {{is believed to}} be the underlying magnetic structure of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, it remains unclear how an MFR evolves into and forms the multi-component structure of a CME. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of an extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) MFR eruption on 2013 May 22 by tracking its morphological evolution, studying its kinematics, and quantifying its thermal property. As EUV brightenings begin, the MFR starts to rise slowly and shows <b>helical</b> <b>threads</b> winding around an axis. Meanwhile, cool filamentary materials descend spirally down to the chromosphere. These features provide direct observational evidence of intrinsically helical structure of the MFR. Through detailed kinematical analysis, we find that the MFR evolution experiences two distinct phases: a slow rise phase and an impulsive acceleration phase. We attribute the first phase to the magnetic reconnection within the quasi-separatrix-layers surrounding the MFR, and the much more energetic second phase to the fast magnetic reconnection underneath the MFR. We suggest that the transition between these two phases be caused by the torus instability. Moreover, we identify that the MFR evolves smoothly into the outer corona and appears as a coherent structure within the white light CME volume. The MFR in the outer corona was enveloped by bright fronts that originated from plasma pile-up in front of the expanding MFR. The fronts are also associated with the preceding sheath region followed the outmost MFR-driven shock. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, and 1 table, accepted by ApJ; any comments are welcome...|$|R
40|$|Pancreatic thread protein (PTP) forms double <b>helical</b> <b>threads</b> in {{the neutral}} pH range after purification, {{undergoing}} freely reversible, pH-dependent globule-fibril transformation. The purified bovine PTP consists on SDS gels of two carbohydrate-free polypeptide chains (Gross et al., 1985). Plasma desorption mass spectrometry and {{amino acid sequence}} analysis now confirm that bovine PTP contains two disulfide-bonded polypeptides, an A chain of 101 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 11, 073 and a B chain of 35 residues with a molecular weight of 3970. The intact protein exhibits a molecular weight of 15, 036, agreeing greater than 99. 9 % with the molecular weight calculated from the sequence. The B chain sequence was determined by gas-phase Edman degradation of the intact polypeptide. The A chain sequence was determined from overlapping peptides generated by cleavage at lysyl, tryptophanyl, and aspartyl-prolyl residues. Based upon the bovine PTP cDNA structure, the two chains of the protein result from cleavage of a single polypeptide with removal of a dipeptide between the NH 2 -terminal A chain and COOH-terminal B chain.

The Cascade complex for CRISPR-mediated {{antiviral}} immunity uses CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to target invading DNA species from mobile elements such as viruses, leading to their destruction. The core of the Cascade effector complex consists of the Cas 5 and Cas 7 subunits, which are widely conserved in prokaryotes. Cas 7 binds crRNA and forms the helical backbone of Cascade. Many archaea encode a version of the Cascade complex (denoted Type I-A) that includes a Csa 5 (or small) subunit, which interacts weakly with the core proteins. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Csa 5 protein from Sulfolobus solfataricus. Csa 5 comprises a conserved α-helical domain with a small insertion consisting of a weakly conserved β-strand domain. In the crystal, the Csa 5 monomers have multimerized into infinite <b>helical</b> <b>threads.</b> At each interface is a strictly conserved intersubunit salt bridge, deletion of which disrupts multimerization. Structural analysis indicates a shared evolutionary history among the small subunits of the CRISPR effector complexes. The same α-helical domain is found in the C-terminal domain of Cse 2 (from Type I-E Cascade), while the N-terminal domain of Cse 2 is found in Cmr 5 of the CMR (Type III-B) effector complex. As Cmr 5 shares no match with Csa 5, two possibilities present themselves: selective domain loss from an ancestral Cse 2 to create two new subfamilies or domain fusion of two separate families to create a new Cse 2 family. A definitive answer awaits structural studies of further small subunits from other CRISPR effector complexes. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Fine {{screw threads}} {{are widely used}} for the bolted joints under severe running conditions. It {{is well known that}} they are {{effective}} to prevent thread loosening due to fine pitch. As for other mechanical characteristics, it has been reported in the previous paper using complex stress functions that the stress concentration at bolt thread root is higher than coarse screw threads and the fatigue strength of threaded fasteners shows a minimum value for varying pitch. However, the latter is questionable since the calculations were conducted under lots of hypotheses. In this study, stress concentration and stress amplitude along thread root are evaluated by three-dimensional finite element analysis, in which numerical models of the bolted joints are constructed so as to accurately represent the effect of <b>thread</b> <b>helical</b> geometry. It is shown that the stress concentration at thread root of fine screw threads is higher than that of coarse screw threads, and the maximum stress amplitude is likely to be lower on the contrary. Meanwhile, it is sometimes recognized that clamping forces of fine screw threads are smaller comparing to those of coarse screw threads when tightened with same torque. To clarify this contradictory phenomenon, tightening experiments are conducted, and it is found that the difference of the energy needed for tightening screw threads is found to be the major cause. 1...|$|R

40|$|During normal {{assembly}} and disassembly of bolted-joint components, thread damage and/or deformation may occur. If threads are overloaded, thread damage/deformation {{can also be}} anticipated. Typical inspection techniques (e. g. using GO-NO GO gages) may not provide adequate visibility {{of the extent of}} thread damage. More detailed inspection techniques have provided actual pitch-diameter profiles of damaged-hardware holes. A method to predict the reduction in thread shear-out capacity of damaged threaded holes has been developed. This method was based on testing and analytical modeling. Test samples were machined to simulate damaged holes in the hardware of interest. Test samples containing pristine parent-holes were also manufactured from the same bar-stock material to provide baseline results for comparison purposes. After the particular parent-hole thread profile was machined into each sample a helical insert was installed into the threaded hole. These samples were tested in a specially designed fixture to determine the maximum load required to shear out the parent threads. It was determined from the pristine-hole samples that, for the specific material tested, each individual thread could resist an average load of 3980 pounds. The shear-out loads of the holes having modified pitch diameters were compared to the ultimate loads of the specimens with pristine holes. An equivalent number of missing <b>helical</b> coil <b>threads</b> was then determined based on the ratio of shear-out loads for each thread configuration. These data were compared with the results from a finite element model (FEM). The model gave insights into the ability of the thread loads to redistribute for both pristine and simulated damage configurations. In this case, it was determined that the overall potential reduction in thread load-carrying capability in the hardware of interest was equal to having up to three fewer threads in the hole that bolt threads could engage. One- half of this potential reduction was due to local pitch-diameter variations and the other half was due to overall pitch-diameter enlargement beyond Class 2 fit. This result was important in that the thread shear capacity for this particular hardware design was the limiting structural capability. The details of the method development, including the supporting testing, data reduction and analytical model results comparison will be discussed hereafter...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} a two-parameter family of models for self-collimated, radially self-similar magnetized outflows from accretion disks. A flow at zero initial poloidal speed leaves {{the surface of}} a rotating disk and is accelerated and redirected toward the pole by <b>helical</b> magnetic fields <b>threading</b> the disk. At large distances from the disk, the flow streamlines asymptote to wrap around the surfaces of nested cylinders. In constrast to previous disk wind modeling, we have explicitly implemented the cylindrical asymptotic boundary condition to examine the consequences for flow dynamics. The solutions are characterized by the logarithmic gradient of the magnetic field strength and the ratios between the footpoint radius R_ 0 and asymptotic radius R_ 1 of streamlines; the Alfven radius must be found as an eigenvalue. Cylindrical solutions require the magnetic field to drop less steeply than 1 /R. We find that the asymptotic poloidal speed on any streamline is typically just a few tenths of the Kepler speed at the corresponding disk footpoint. The asymptotic toroidal Alfven speed is, however, a few times the footpoint Kepler speed. We discuss the implications of the models for interpretations of observed optical jets and molecular outflows from young stellar systems. We suggest that the difficulty of achieving strong collimation in vector velocity simultaneously with a final speed comparable to the disk rotation rate argues against isolated jets and in favor of models with broader winds.
