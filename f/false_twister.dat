However, conventional low twist ring yarns have very low strength and, thus, cannot be used. In this paper, a modification technique is described for producing singles ring yarns with a low twist and a relatively high strength simultaneously. A <b>false</b> <b>twister</b> was used to increase fiber migration and entanglement in the spinning triangle, leading to a reinforcement of yarn strength. The yarn cross sectional structure, fiber path and yarn surface were examined and yarn tensile and torsional properties were evaluated. The results revealed that the modified yarn had a structure and properties different from the conventional ring spun yarns. The fiber path modification was kept in the resultant yarn.
