30|$|In {{order to}} achieve a better {{environmental}} performance through optimal waste-load allocation among different outlets, the natural assimilative capacities of the receiving water body near each outlet {{should be taken into}} consideration. For example, the field tests show that, the receiving water bodies near the <b>discharge</b> <b>outlets</b> at Changshou Chemical Plant # 1, Hengliangzi Drainage, and Fuling Chemical plant, has high capacities in diluting COD by physical advection–diffusion mechanisms and chemical and biological degradation; while the receiving water bodies near the other 8 <b>discharge</b> <b>outlets</b> have higher capacities in diluting the ammonia-nitrogen (NH 4 +-N). For formulating the optimization model, a concept of environmental performance index (EPI) was defined to reflect combined effects of the waste load level from each outlet and the assimilative capacity of the receiving water body near the outlet. Its magnitude represents the relative importance of each outlet in improving water quality with its discharge load being optimally allocated.|$|R

40|$|Natural Science Foundation of China [20777063, 40976070]Background {{and purpose}} More and more {{coal-fired}} power plants equipped with seawater flue gas desulfurization systems have been built in coastal areas. They release large amount of mercury (Hg) -containing waste seawater into the adjacent seas. However, very limited impact studies have been carried out. Our research targeted the distribution of Hg in the seawater, sediment, biota, and atmosphere, and its environmental transportation. Methods Seawater samples were collected from five sites: 1, sea areas adjacent to the power plant; 2, near discharge outlets; 3, the aeration pool of the power plant; and 4 and 5, two reference sites. The total gaseous Hg was determined in situ with a Tekran 2537 B. Analyses of total Hg (TM) followed the USEPA methods. Results In most {{part of the study}} area, TM concentrations were close to the reference values and Hg transfer from the seawater into the sediment and biota was not obvious. However, in the aeration pool and near the waste <b>discharge</b> <b>outlets,</b> atmospheric and surface seawater concentrations of TM were much higher, compared with those at a reference site. The concentration ranges of total gaseous Hg and TM in seawater were 3. 83 - 8. 60 ng/m(3) and 79. 0 - 198 ng/L near the <b>discharge</b> <b>outlets,</b> 7. 23 - 13. 5 ng/m(3) and 186 - 616 ng/L in the aeration pool, and 2. 98 - 4. 06 ng/m(3) and 0. 47 - 1. 87 ng/L at a reference point. Conclusions This study suggested that the Hg in the flue gas desulfurization waste seawater was not only transported and diluted with sea currents, but also could possibly be transferred into the atmosphere from the aeration pool and from the <b>discharge</b> <b>outlets...</b>|$|R

This sewage turns the river into essentially an open sewer. The sewage problem was reported in the year 1911., and a need to purify Montreal sewage in 1935.

50|$|In more detail, one {{can look}} at how the {{hydrostatic}} pressure varies through a static siphon, considering in turn the vertical tube from the top reservoir, the vertical tube from the bottom reservoir, and the horizontal tube connecting them (assuming a U-shape). At liquid level in the top reservoir, the liquid is under atmospheric pressure, and as one goes up the siphon, the hydrostatic pressure decreases (under vertical pressure variation), since the weight of atmospheric pressure pushing the water up is counterbalanced by the column of water in the siphon pushing down (until one reaches the maximum height of a barometer/siphon, at which point the liquid cannot be pushed higher) - the hydrostatic pressure {{at the top of the}} tube is then lower than atmospheric pressure by an amount proportional to the height of the tube. Doing the same analysis on the tube rising from the lower reservoir yields the pressure at the top of that (vertical) tube; this pressure is lower because the tube is longer (there is more water pushing down), and requires that the lower reservoir is lower than the upper reservoir, or more generally that the <b>discharge</b> <b>outlet</b> simply be lower than the surface of the upper reservoir. Considering now the horizontal tube connecting them, one sees that the pressure at the top of the tube from the top reservoir is higher (since less water is being lifted), while the pressure at the top of the tube from the bottom reservoir is lower (since more water is being lifted), and since liquids move from high pressure to low pressure, the liquid flows across the horizontal tube from the top basin to the bottom basin. Note that the liquid is under positive pressure (compression) throughout the tube, not tension.|$|E
30|$|The EFDC {{model was}} then run to {{calculate}} the yearly average size of PMZ for each <b>discharge</b> <b>outlet,</b> and the yearly average PMZPL can then be calculated using Equation (1).

Table  3 gives the simulated PMZ values and the calculated values of DLR, PMZR and SI for each <b>discharge</b> <b>outlet.</b> It is indicated that different <b>discharge</b> <b>outlet</b> has different level of sensitivity index. A higher SI value represents a bigger PMZ area influenced by a specific outlet and a stronger pollution impact from the same outlet. Therefore, the concept of sensitivity index can help rank the significance and influence of a specific <b>discharge</b> <b>outlet</b> on {{the formation of the}} pollutant mixing zone in its surrounding water body in comparison to all other outlets. From this sense, a <b>discharge</b> <b>outlet</b> with a high SI has a big potential for improving reservoir water quality if a same level of waste load is cut across the board from all outlets. In other words, this outlet will have a better environmental performance than others if appropriate action is taken for water pollution control purpose.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} biological {{effects of}} the process water (PW) from the Nyhamna gas processing plant on the West coast of Norway was assessed using biological responses in the Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. Farmed cod were placed in large mesh cages at strategic locations from the Nyhamna PW <b>discharge</b> <b>outlet</b> including: 1) < 50 m from the outlet; 2) 300 - 400 m downstream from the outlet; and 3) reference location (4 - 5 km from the outlet). A suite of biomarkers were measured in the cod following a relatively short (10 day) and a long (9 week) exposure duration. The biomarkers measured after 10 days were micronuclei formation (MN), vitellogenin (VTG) and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), whilst those measured after 9 weeks included gill and gonad histopathology, peroxisomal proliferation, and neutral lipid content of the liver. Supporting parameters including condition index (CI), liver somatic index (LSI) and plasma chemistry were measured in fish from both short and long exposures. The exposure of the fish to chemicals thought to be present within the PW following treatment was determined using bile metabolites of exposed cod, together with passive sampling devices. The passive sampling devices included polar organic chemical integrated samplers (POCIS) and diffusion gradients in thin films (DGTs), which were used to target alkylphenols (APs) and metals respectively. POCIS and DGTs were able to detect APs and metals within the receiving waters at Nyhamna but were only found {{to be present in}} low concentrations. There were no significant increases in biomarkers with proximity to the <b>discharge</b> <b>outlet.</b> Fish held within cages less than 50 m and 300 - 400 m from the <b>discharge</b> <b>outlet</b> had no significant effect on any of the biomarkers measured when compared to the reference and pre-exposure groups. The CI, LSI, and plasma chemistry clearly showed that fish caged for 9 weeks had suffered from starvation, which also resulted in fish mortalities in one of the fish groups. Overall, based on the chemical assessment of APs and metals in the receiving waters at Nyhamna using POCIS, DGTs and bile metabolites, the PW discharge posed little to no environmental risk.
