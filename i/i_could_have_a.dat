Former Led Zeppelin bassist JohnPaul Jones said, [...] "It's pure trust," [...] and noted that [...] "there are dangers on both sides. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{successful}} album and just sign with a major, or they could decide not to pay me." [...] Jones {{explained that he was}} accustomed to [...] "working in situations that do rely on trust and integrity, those old-fashioned words" [...] because Led Zeppelin had no contract with its manager. Another DGM band, alternative rock group TheRosenbergs, opted to work with the label following conflicts with their previous label [...] UniversalRecords, which had even demanded control of the band's domain name: in contrast, DGM had encouraged them to retain control of their own master recordings and provided them with funds for touring and promoting their album.|$|E

[...] As Hou was about to be beheaded, he stated to the general overseeing the execution, [...] "I, Hou Junji, am not the type to commit treason, but I stumbled many times and reached this point. [...] But as I destroyed two kingdoms as a general, please speak for me to His Imperial Majesty to request that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> son remaining to carry on the lineage, on the basis of my accomplishments." [...] Emperor Taizong, when he heard this, pardoned Hou's wife and children but exiled them to the modern Guangdong region, and confiscated his properties.|$|E
