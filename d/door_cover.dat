50|$|Allowing the {{interior}} temperature {{to rise above}} freezing point risks weakening the shelter significantly, especially if the outside air temperature is near freezing.

5000|$|The 1974 Raider Snowmobiles {{experienced}} a few revisions from the 1973 model. The biggest changes were revised graphics on the snowmobile. The 1974 model year also marked {{the change of}} the Raider lineup into three distinct models, the Hawk, Eagle, and Double Eagle. Most 1974 Eagle Raiders are actually unsold 1973 Raider 34TT and 44TT model inventory. Many 1973 Raiders had gone unsold due to industry wide overproduction, poor snow {{in most of the}} midwest, and the OPEC oil embargo. Raider dealers were sent an [...] "upgrade kit" [...] with new 1974 style decals, the black front applique, and a new 1974 owner's manual. The dealer service bulletin reminded dealers to [...] "be sure to remove the 1973 owner's manual & replace it with the 1974 owner's manual". The 1974 Hawk was a stripped down Raider model. It had no gauges, no electric start, no front ski shocks, no brake lights, no hinged gas <b>door</b> <b>cover,</b> and no passenger seat. It came equipped with a 340cc CCW engine, with the '72 Raider style smaller intake and carburator, and '72 Raider wiring and chrome brake and throttle controls, and the '72 style dash mounted toggle light and high beam switch. The '74 Hawk {{seems to have been a}} way for LVI to use up left-over '72 Raider parts, and at the same time, have a cheaper entry level sled.The 1974 Double Eagle was again a completely new, redesigned sled. It was slightly larger and used a more advanced coil sprung rear suspension technology than the Hawk and Eagle models. It also featured an injection molded body, hatch and pan, and a wider front ski stance. This final redesign was intended to reduce the total number of parts needed to build the machine, and therefore speed up production.|$|E

Aiming at the deformation and cracking, the numerical simulation of BCD 268 <b>door</b> <b>cover</b> was conducted, and two kinds of different options to strengthen the ribs were proposed, then the two programs were carried out through finite element analysis, and prototypes were fabricated high and low temperature impact test for validation.

40|$|In {{recognition}} of its outstanding geology, the coast between Orcombe Rocks in south-east Devon and Old Harry Rocks in south Dorset was granted World Heritage status in December 2001. The geology of this coast is described, {{together with the}} recently mapped 1 : 50 000 geological sheets 328 Dorchester, 341 / 342 West Fleet and Weymouth and 342 / 343 Swanage. The diverse geology ranges from the Late Permian to Quaternary, representing more than 200 million years of geological time and many different ancient environments that included arid desert, subtropical seas and cold periglacial conditions. The stratigraphy is described in detail and incorporates revisions of the Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous and Palaeogene successions. The region is justly renowned for its rich variety of fossils, found especially in the Lower Jurassic rocks around Lyme Regis and Charmouth. Many scientifically important specimens have come from these crumbling mudstone cliffs, including marine reptiles first made famous {{by the work of}} the 19 th century Lyme Regis fossil collector Mary Anning. During the Quaternary, the district lay beyond the influence of the glaciers and outwash that covered much of northern Britain. Head and the residual claywith- flints are the main deposits preserved from that period together with river alluvium and terrace deposits. The structural geology is described in the context of basin evolution. This area was part of the Wessex–Channel Basin that developed throughout the Mesozoic. Numerous borehole records provide the basis for a detailed assessment of thickness variation and this is related to structural development. Mesozoic structures continued to influence later structural development. Periods of earth movement associated with the uplift of the Alps in southern Europe caused parts of the succession to be spectacularly folded, as seen for example at Durdle <b>Door</b> (<b>Cover</b> photograph). Many past geomorphological studies have emphasised the close relationship between geology and the development of coastal landscape in the region, {{and there are a number}} of spectacular natural arches and sea stacks. Landslips, both active and dormant, are described and occur in a variety of forms unrivalled in the UK. Inland too, the influence of geology on the landscape is very strong, from the high rolling chalk downland north of Dorchester to the lower lying sandy heaths formed of Cenozoic (Palaeogene) sediments farther east around Wareham. In the Isle of Purbeck, picturesque Corfe Castle sits astride the sharply defined east–west ridge of the Purbeck Hills, formed by steeply dipping beds of chalk, part of a huge monoclinal fold that extends eastwards to the Isle of Wight. Geology has also played a part in the development of the region, summarised in the Economic geology chapter. This region supplied the Portland Stone and Purbeck Marble that has been used in many great cathedrals and civic buildings. Palaeogene clays are an important source of raw material for ceramics, and the Wytch Farm Oilfield, near Bournemouth, is the largest onshore oilfield in the UK. The text is fully referenced, and additional information includes a borehole and a fossil inventory. The geological succession tabulated opposite summarises the age, stratigraphical classification, lithology and thickness of the rock types seen in south Dorset and on the World Heritage Coast...|$|E
