An econometric model in Ordinary Least Square is employed on time series data for the period 1997 to 2014. This is aimed at measuring the effect of gross domestic product, effective duty rate, <b>import</b> exemption, <b>import</b> value and relative price on <b>import</b> revenue generated in Ghana. The paper also examines the reforms in <b>import</b> revenue administration, reforms in <b>import</b> revenue generation, effect of automation on <b>import</b> revenue mobilization, the performance of <b>import</b> revenue, sources of <b>import</b> revenue leakages and measures to improve the collection of <b>import</b> revenue. <b>Import</b> revenue is collected by the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority. The results reveal a strong relationship between GDP, <b>Import</b> Exemption, <b>Import</b> Value and <b>Import</b> Revenue.

From the perspective of oil supply security, how should China portfolio crude oil and petroleum product <b>imports</b> to minimize its oil <b>import</b> risk? Using portfolio theory and a diversification index approach, this paper compares and analyzes the supply, price and transport risks of crude oil and petroleum product <b>imports.</b> Our {{results show that the}} following: (1) Specific risk (diversification risk) and marine transport risk of China's petroleum product <b>imports</b> are lower than that of crude oil <b>imports.</b> (2) The average rate of return of China's petroleum product <b>imports</b> is higher than that of crude oil <b>imports.</b> Moreover, the average <b>import</b> price variance of petroleum product <b>imports</b> is lower than that of crude oil <b>imports.</b> Thus, the systematic risk (price risk) of petroleum products is lower too.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Thoroughbred breed spread throughout the world; they were <b>imported</b> into North America starting in 1730 and into Australia, Europe, Japan and South America during the 19th century.

For some <b>imported</b> ASL varieties, such as those used in West Africa, it is still an open question how similar they are to American ASL.|$|E
