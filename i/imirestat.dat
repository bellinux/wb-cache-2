The search for specific inhibitors of this enzyme has thus become a major pharmaceutic challenge. In this study, we applied both X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry to characterize the interactions between aldose reductase and four representative inhibitors: AminoSNM, <b>Imirestat,</b> LCB 3071, and IDD 384. If crystallography remains obviously {{the only way to get}} an extensive description of the contacts between an inhibitor and the enzymatic site, the duration of the crystallographic analysis makes this technique incompatible with high throughput screenings of inhibitors. On the other hand, dissociation experiments monitored by mass spectrometry permitted us to evaluate rapidly the relative gas-phase stabilities of the aldose reductase-inhibitor noncovalent complexes. In our experiments, dissociation in the gas-phase was provoked by increasing the accelerating voltage of the ions (Vc) in the sourceâ€“analyzer interface region: the Vc value needed to dissociate 50 % of the noncovalent complex initially present (Vc 50) was taken as a gas-phase stability parameter of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Interestingly, the Vc 50 were found to correlate with the energy of the electrostatic and H-bond interactions involved in the contact aldose reductase/inhibitor (Eel-H), computed from the crystallographic model. This finding may be specially interesting in a context of drug development. Actually, during a drug design optimization phase, the binding of the drug to the target enzyme is often optimized by modifying its interatomic electrostatic and H-bond contacts, because they usually depend on a single atom change on the drug, and are easier to introduce than the hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, the Vc 50 may help to monitor the chemical modifications introduced in new inhibitors. X-ray crystallography is clearly needed to get the details of the contacts and to rationalize the design. Nevertheless, once the cycle of chemical modification is engaged, mass spectrometry can be used to select a priori the drug candidates which are worthy of further crystallographic investigation. We thus propose to use the two techniques in a complementary way, to improve the screening of large collections of inhibitors...|$|E
