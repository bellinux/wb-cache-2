5|$|On {{the death}} of Alphonso Vincent in 1932, his son George {{inherited}} the property. He lived at the site in an old lorry {{until his death in}} 1973. The mill passed to his daughter, who sold it in 1974 to Mr and Mrs Humphries, who intended to convert it into a house. They later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration. In 1976, the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale. Thelnetham windmill was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November 1979, and plans for restoration were made. The consortium consisted of Mark Barnard, Charles <b>Dolman,</b> Peter <b>Dolman,</b> David Pearce and Chris Seago. The derelict mill and an acre of land cost £6,000.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{explained}} {{that he had to}} wait until the mid-1980s to make the film because visual effects technology was finally advanced enough to execute his vision. Meanwhile, actor-turned-director Ron Howard was looking to do a fantasy film. He was at Industrial Light & Magic during the post-production phase of Cocoon, when he was first approached by Lucas to direct Willow. He had previously starred in Lucas' American Graffiti, and Lucas felt that he and Howard shared a symbiotic relationship similar to the one he enjoyed with Steven Spielberg. Howard nominated Bob <b>Dolman</b> to write the screenplay based on Lucas' story. <b>Dolman</b> had worked with him on a 1983 television pilot called Little Shots that had not resulted in a series, and Lucas admired Dolman's work on the sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|The hussar cavalry were garbed in a black, {{light blue}} {{collared}} <b>dolman,</b> sometimes {{with a black}} pelisse. Black overalls were worn over tight breeches of the hussar style. The hussars also wore a black Shako. The sword and equipment were originally of Austrian design. The Uhlan squadron wore a green kurtka or lancer's jacket with red facings and a traditional czapka cap, their uniform being {{a copy of the}} Austrian Graf von Meerveldt Uhlan Regiment. The lance had a red and yellow pennon. By 1815, the Uhlans were wearing all-black uniforms, but retained the yellow-topped czapka.|$|E
50|$|A {{rectangular}} <b>dolmen</b> (Rechteckdolmen), extended <b>dolmen</b> (German: erweiteter <b>Dolmen)</b> or enlarged <b>dolmen</b> is {{a specific}} type of megalith, rectangular in shape, with upright sidestones and, usually, two capstones. The term rectangular <b>dolmen</b> was coined by Ekkehard Aner and is used especially in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, where dolmens with this type of ground plan primarily occur. A more precise term, however, is extended <b>dolmen,</b> used by Ewald Schuldt and Ernst Sprockhoff, because these types of <b>dolmen</b> also occur with trapezoidal ground plans (e.g. the Gnewitz).|$|R

5|$|<b>Dolman</b> joined Howard and Lucas at Skywalker Ranch for {{a series}} of lengthy story conferences, and wrote seven drafts of his script between the spring and fall of 1986. Pre-production began in late 1986. Various major film studios turned down the chance to {{distribute}} and co-finance it with Lucasfilm because they believed the fantasy genre was unsuccessful. This was largely due to films such as Krull, Legend, Dragonslayer, and Labyrinth. Lucas took it to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which was headed by Alan Ladd, Jr. Ladd and Lucas shared a relationship {{as far back as the}} mid-1970s, when Ladd, running 20th Century Fox, greenlighted Lucas' idea for Star Wars. However, in 1986, MGM was facing financial troubles, and major investment in a fantasy film was perceived as a risk. Ladd advanced half the $35 million budget for it in return for theatrical and television rights, leaving Lucasfilm with home video and pay television rights to offer in exchange for the other half.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film in 1972, approaching Howard to direct during the post-production phase of Cocoon in 1985. Bob <b>Dolman</b> was brought in to write the screenplay, coming up with seven drafts before finishing in late 1986. It was then set up at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and principal photography began in April 1987, finishing the following October. The majority of filming took place at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England, as well as Wales and New Zealand. Industrial Light & Magic created the visual effects sequences, which led to a revolutionary breakthrough with digital morphing technology. The film was released in 1988 to mixed reviews from critics, but was a modest financial success, received two Academy Award nominations, and has developed a cult following amongst fantasy fans.|$|E

25|$|Following his {{successful}} first-class debut, <b>Dolman</b> was recruited by Warwickshire County Cricket Club {{to play in}} the 1982 Second XI Championship, where he played six matches, taking 39 wickets at 14.90, with a best return of 7/38 against Leicestershire Second XI, and scoring 174 runs at 29.00, with a highest score of 82 against Leicestershire. The former Australian Test spinner Ashley Mallett called him the most exciting spin prospect he had ever seen and English cricket writer David Frith was also enthusiastic about Dolman's cricketing future.

25|$|Upthorpe Mill {{was built}} in 1751. It was {{originally}} built as an open trestle post mill. In 1818 it was moved to its present site. At {{some point in time}} the Common sails were replaced by Double Patent sails, a roundhouse later being added and a fantail fitted to turn the mill into wind automatically. The mill ended its commercial working life on a single pair of sails. It was disused by 1918 and in 1937 was becoming derelict. Rex Wailes inspected the mill on behalf of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and an appeal for funds to restore the mill was launched in 1938. In 1939, millwright Amos Clarke, along with Messrs Hunts of Soham commenced repairs which cost £600. A new side girt was fitted to {{the left side of the}} mill and the roundhouse roof was repaired. The tailstones were removed at this time. The intention was to fit the cast iron windshaft from Great Mill, Wickhambrook in place of the existing wooden windshaft and to add a new pair of sails but this work was not done owing to the outbreak of the Second World War. The mill was painted grey to reduce its conspicuousness as a landmark, as it was close to RAF Shepherds Grove. The mill was worked during the war, but ceased to be used in 1946 as it was unprofitable. By the late 1960s, the mill was again becoming derelict, and the fantail was carefully dismantled by Chris Hullcoop and Philip Lennard. In 1979, emergency repairs were carried out by Suffolk Mills Group and in 1986 the mill was bought by Richard Duke. Restoration work was carried out and the mill was able to grind again in 1990. In 1993, the mill was bought by Peter <b>Dolman</b> and further restoration work was carried out.|$|E
500|$|Olga was due {{to enter}} society {{in the summer of}} 1899, but after the death of her brother George at the age of 27, her first {{official}} public appearance was delayed by a year until 1900. She hated the experience, and later told her official biographer Ian Vorres, [...] "I felt as though I were an animal in a cage—exhibited to the public for the first time." [...] From 1901, Olga was appointed honorary Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Akhtyrsky Hussar Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army. The Akhtyrsky Hussars were famous for their victory over Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Kulm in 1813, and wore a distinctive brown <b>dolman.</b>|$|E
500|$|After [...] "composed performances" [...] {{on trial}} in pre-season, Courtney signed a one-year {{contract}} with Conference Premier club Kidderminster Harriers on 20 July 2009. He made his debut as a substitute in the 66th minute of a 1–0 victory over Hayes & Yeading United on 8 August 2009, which was followed by his first start in a 1–0 defeat to Salisbury City on 11 August due to Liam <b>Dolman</b> not being fit. He played against Tamworth on 31 August 2009 despite an injury and although he was still suffering this injury {{he was able to}} play in the next match, a 2–0 defeat to Eastbourne Borough. Courtney commented in September 2009 that Kidderminster's defence was taking time to gel, saying [...] "We've all played at a high standard, individually and collectively we are good, but there's something missing. I think it's communication between us, which is why we're making mistakes." [...] His first and only goal for Kidderminster came with a low shot at Kettering Town in a 2–0 victory on 21 November 2009 and manager Mark Yates said [...] "It was a good finish by Duane, he does it in training quite often". He played for Kidderminster in their run to the FA Trophy semi-final, in which they were beaten 5–1 on aggregate by Stevenage Borough. Courtney suffered an ankle injury against Cambridge United on 30 March 2010 and returned in the following match against Altrincham on 3 April, in which he was forced to be substituted due to his ankle. He did not miss any further playing time as he featured in the following match, a 1–1 draw with Rushden & Diamonds on 5 April 2010. He finished 2009–10 with 49 appearances and 1 goal for Kidderminster.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{the simple}} <b>dolmen</b> {{as a rule}} only had one {{capstone}} (but could have two), the rectangular <b>dolmen,</b> which differs primarily in the orientation of its support stones (standing) from the simple <b>dolmen</b> (lying), usually had two capstones (but also can have just one). Once a third capstone is added, it is called a great <b>dolmen</b> (Großdolmen) in Germany.
