40|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} (CSR) as a nominal term clearly resonates with scholars and practitioners alike. As a scientific concept, however, {{it has often}} been criticized for its lack of definitional precision and poor measurement. In this paper we review and assess intensional and <b>extensional</b> <b>definitions</b> of the concept, as they have figured in the prior CSR literature. But we also go beyond these traditional review exercises by assessing the role (if any) of the concept in positive theorizing. The upshot of this analysis is that since the CSR concept adds nothing of value to existing frameworks in the field of management and organization, such as the economizing and legitimizing perspectives, it is best to discard it altogether.

40|$|Emotion {{theories}} endorse similar componential {{definitions of}} emotion (there is fair consensus {{about the most}} important components of an emotional episode), but different differential definitions (they propose different criteria to delineate the set of emotions from other sets) and different <b>extensional</b> <b>definitions</b> (they subdivide the set of emotions into different subsets). Emotion theories have different views of emotion causation. Differences include (a) the level of analysis that they focus on, (b) the step in the causal chain that they address (c) the component in which they situate their causal forces, (d) whether {{they think that the}} remaining components in the emotional episode are caused by a common processes or by separate ones, (e) whether causal processes are specific for emotions, for subsets of emotions, or for components of emotions, (f) the number of causal processes or outputs that they postulate, and hence the amount of variation that they explain, and (g) the nature of the causal mechanisms they propose (constructive, associative, sensory-motor), and hence whether the types of variation that they explain are computed on-line, based on learning, or hardwired. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Objectives—We {{wanted to}} develop a method for {{evaluating}} the consistency and usefulness of LOINC code use across different institutions, and to evaluate the degree of interoperability that can be attained when using LOINC codes for laboratory data exchange. Our specific goals were to: 1) Determine if any contradictory knowledge exists in LOINC. 2) Determine how many LOINC codes were used in a truly interoperable fashion between systems. 3) Provide suggestions for improving the semantic interoperability of LOINC. Methods—We collected <b>Extensional</b> <b>Definitions</b> (EDs) of LOINC usage from three institutions. The version space approach was used to divide LOINC codes into small sets, which made auditing of LOINC use across the institutions feasible. We then compared pairings of LOINC codes from the three institutions for consistency and usefulness. Results—The number of LOINC codes evaluated were 1, 917, 1, 267 and 1, 693 as obtained from ARUP, Intermountain and Regenstrief respectively. There were 2, 022, 2, 030, and 2, 301 version spaces among ARUP & Intermountain, Intermountain & Regenstrief and ARUP & Regenstrief respectively.

There has been no or very little research regarding colour terms conducted {{from the viewpoint of}} (meta) lexicography 2. The present study is meant to evaluate existing dictionary definitions of Basic Colour Terms 3 (henceforth BCTs) from the colour lexicon of English, Japanese and Polish in order to detect any doubtful content which could be improved to equip the dictionary user with richer, more adequate information regarding the colour lexicon. The immediate aims of the study are to determine: 1) what definition types are used to define CTs 2) what prototypes <b>extensional</b> <b>definitions</b> point to when defining BCTs and how these relate to the data obtained from naive native speakers of the languages in question.

This paper discusses research in which the following hypothesis was empirically tested: extensionally defined principles, as well as cited past cases, can help in predicting the principles and cases that might be relevant in the analysis of new cases. To investigate this phenomenon computationally, a large set of professional ethics cases was analyzed and a computational model called SIROCCO, a system for retrieving principles and past cases, was constructed. Empirical evidence is presented that the operationalization information contained in extensionally defined principles can be leveraged to predict the principles and past cases that are relevant to new problem situations. This is shown through an ablation experiment, comparing SIROCCO to a version of itself that does not employ operationalization information. Further, it is shown that SIROCCO’s extensionally defined principles and case citations help it to outperform a full-text retrieval program that does not employ such information...|$|R
40|$|Evaluative {{adjectives}} {{have often}} been claimed to manifest a strong, an even exclusive, preference for the nonrestrictive reading. For those languages like French that allow poth the post and pre-head positions {{for at least a}} subset of their adjectives, a frequent observation reported in support of this claim is that evaluative adjectives are often odd in post-nominal position. The argument relies on what has been called the complementarity hypothesis, namely the hypothesis that pre-head modifiers receive a nonrestrictive interpretation in Romance, while post-head modifiers receive a restrictive interpretation. An immediate problem for this argument is that evaluatives do appear in postnominal positions in corpora. One of the goals {{of this paper is to}} reconcile these data with the nonrestrictive bias and the complementarity hypothesis. The idea pursued is that a modifier can either be (non) restrictive according to the standard definitions, which are purely extensional, or be (non) restrictive with respect to a particular modal base α (thus, α-restrictive vs. α-nonrestrictive). Being restrictive or α-restrictive (respectively nonrestrictive or α-nonrestrictive) allows the modifier to appear in the post-head (respectively pre-head) position. In Section 2. 1, we recall the standard (purely <b>extensional)</b> <b>definitions</b> of (non) restrictivity. We then show that these definitions cannot distinguish between restrictive and nonrestrictive modifiers in a number of contexts, e. g. in non-partitive indefinites. In Section 2. 3, we introduce modal definitions of (non) restrictivity that solve the problem. Section 3 identifies the contexts in which evaluative adjectives can appear in post-nominal position and explains why, on the basis of the definitions of (α) -(non) restrictivity built in pre- vious sections. The analysis proposed is compared with two previous accounts of the nonrestrictive bias of evaluative predicate...|$|R
40|$|Gathering {{huge amounts}} of complex {{information}} (data and knowledge) is very common nowadays. This calls for the necessity to represent, store and manipulate complex information (e. g. detect correlations and patterns, discover explanations, construct predictive models etc.). Furthermore, being autonomously maintained, data can change in time or even change its base structure, {{making it difficult for}} representation systems to accommodate these changes. Current representation and storage systems are not very flexible in dealing with big changes and also they are not concerned with the ability of performing complex data manipulations of the sort mentioned above. On the other hand, data manipulation systems cannot easily work with structural or relational data, but just with flat data representations. We want {{to bridge the gap between}} the two, by introducing a new type of database structure, called Graph Databases (GDB), based on a natural graph representation. Our Graph Databases are able to represent as graphs any kind of information, naturally accommodate changes in data, and they also make easier for Machine Learning methods to use the stored information. We are mainly concerned with the design and implementation of GDB in this paper. Thus, we define the Data Definition Language (DDL) that contains <b>extensional</b> <b>definitions</b> as well as intentional definitions, and Data Manipulation Language (DML) that we use to pose queries. Then we show conceptually how to do updates, how to accommodate changes, and how to define new concepts or ask higher order queries that are not easily answer by SQL language. We also show how to transform a relational database into a GDB. Although, we show how all these things can be done using our graph databases, we do not implement all of them. This is a very laborious project that goes much beyond our class project goals. We do implement the graph databases, show how we can ask queries on them, and also how to transform relational databases into graph databases in order to be able to reuse relational data already existent...|$|R

40|$|The modular {{nature of}} rules learned by most {{inductive}} {{machine learning algorithms}} makes them difficult and costly to maintain when the knowledge {{they are based on}} changes. Ripple-down rules, a tree-like rule-based concept description format, overcomes these problems by using rules that operate in the context of other rules. Whereas most algorithms use the standard propositional attribute–value representation for input, relational learning with examples expressed in first-order languages opens up a myriad of new classification tasks, and new approaches to existing tasks. However, current relational learning algorithms employ simple rule formats that lack the desirable features of ripple-down rules. This thesis describes a system that combines techniques of propositional and relational learning, and generates a concept description in ripple-down rule form. The system can learn from purely propositional data, employing both propositional and relational techniques, or relational data, using background knowledge presented as <b>extensional</b> relation <b>definitions.</b> The system illustrates several benefits of the combined approach, and its performance is compared with existing propositional and relationa...|$|R
