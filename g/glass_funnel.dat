40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel process of extracting lead oxide nanoparticles from cathode-ray tube (CRT) <b>funnel</b> <b>glass</b> using self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) method. The impacts of added amount of <b>funnel</b> <b>glass</b> on the extraction ratio of lead, the lead extraction velocity and the micromorphology, {{as well as}} particle size of extracted nanoparticles were investigated. We found that self-propagating reaction {{in the presence of}} Mg and Fe 2 O 3 could separate lead preferentially and superfine lead oxide nanoparticles were obtained from a collecting chamber. The separation ratio was related closely to the amount of <b>funnel</b> <b>glass</b> added in the original mixture. At <b>funnel</b> <b>glass</b> addition of no more than 40 wt. %. over 90 wt. % of lead was recovered from <b>funnel</b> <b>glass.</b> High extraction yield reveals that the network structure of <b>funnel</b> <b>glass</b> was fractured due to the dramatic energy generated during the SHS melting process.

This {{means that}} even though {{it seems to be}} solid at room temperature and can be shattered with a hard impact, it is actually fluid and will flow over time, but extremely slowly. The pitch drop experiment taking place at University of Queensland is a long-term experiment which demonstrates the flow of a piece of pitch over many years. For the experiment, pitch was put in a <b>glass</b> <b>funnel</b> and allowed to slowly drip out. Since the pitch was allowed to start dripping in 1930, only nine drops have fallen. It was calculated in the 1980s that the pitch in the experiment has a viscosity approximately 230 billion (2.3×1011) times that of water. The eighth drop fell on 28 November 2000, and the ninth drop fell on 17 April 2014. Another experiment was begun by a colleague of Nobel Prize winner Ernest Walton in the physics department of Trinity College in Ireland in 1944. Over the years, the pitch had produced several drops, but none had been recorded.

Recycled CRT <b>funnel</b> <b>glass</b> with a relatively high density (∼ 3000 kg m− 3) {{can be used as a}} potential material for the production of heavyweight concrete. This paper presents the results of an investigation on the feasibility of using recycled CRT <b>funnel</b> <b>glass,</b> both treated (lead has been removed from the glass surface) and untreated (without removal of lead) as partial and full replacements of fine aggregates in heavyweight barite concrete. The inclusion of barite aggregate and recycled <b>funnel</b> <b>glass</b> increased the hardened density but reduced the compressive and splitting tensile strengths. The replacement of natural fine aggregate with recycled CRT glass had no significant effect on the elastic modulus but considerably improved the drying shrinkage of the concrete. In conclusion, the overall properties of heavyweight barite concrete made with the treated and untreated recycled CRT <b>funnel</b> <b>glass</b> are comparable, except for lead leaching results. The results show that it is feasible to use the treated CRT glass as 100 % substitution of fine aggregate in making heavyweight concrete.
