500|$|Capt. William P. Halliday, Cairo’s most {{prominent}} citizen, {{died at the}} Lexington Hotel in Chicago at midnight Friday night. [...] Capt. Halliday had been ill for about six weeks. [...] He went to Chicago to receive treatment and change of air to ward off an attack of malaria. [...] While feeling badly, {{he was able to}} be up and around until a few days before his death. [...] His friends and family did not anticipate his demise would come so soon, but it appeared the captain himself did. [...] He made his will while in Chicago and prepared for the end. [...] A few days before his death, however, his condition grew so bad that his family were summoned to his bedside. [...] Thursday morning about 3 o’clock he lost consciousness, and although life was kept up by artificial means for many hours, he slept away and <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>at</b> midnight the final dissolution came.|$|E
500|$|The Glastonbury Festival 2010 {{took place}} between 23 and 28 June. On the last night, Michael Eavis {{appeared}} on the main stage with headline artist Stevie Wonder to sing the chorus of the latter's [...] "Happy Birthday", marking the festival's 40th year. Tickets went on sale on 4 October 2009, using the same £50 deposit scheme introduced the previous year; unlike the previous two years, and {{more in common with}} earlier festivals, the tickets for the 2010 edition sold out in less than 24 hours. U2 were due to headline the Pyramid Stage on <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>at</b> Glastonbury 2010, but due to frontman Bono sustaining a back injury they were forced to pull out. According to the media, Bono was [...] "gutted", even having written a song especially for the festival. Damon Albarn's Gorillaz replaced U2, and joined Muse and Stevie Wonder for the Saturday and Sunday headline slots respectively. [...] It was Albarn's second headlining act in two years. Pet Shop Boys returned after 10 years to headline the Other Stage on the Saturday Night. The entire stage set from their Pandemonium Tour was brought in for the performance which was extremely well received. Radiohead's Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood made a surprise appearance with a nine-song set. [...] The weather at the festival was among some of the best ever, the festival-goers enjoying 3 days of abundant sunshine and very warm to hot temperatures, which reached close to 30 degrees on the Sunday; it was the first rain-free festival since 2002 and the hottest since the festival began.|$|E

2500|$|Vélez's {{off-screen}} exploits {{also served}} {{to blur the}} line between her onscreen persona and her real personality. After her death, journalist Bob Thomas recalled that Vélez was a [...] "lively part of the Hollywood scene" [...] who wore loud clothing and made as much noise as possible. She attended boxing matches every <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>at</b> the Hollywood Legion Stadium and would stand on her ringside seat and scream at the fighters. Other stories circulated that supported the lusty and exhibitionist aspects of her image. There were reports that Vélez frequently lifted her skirt up while dancing at parties and also flashed people revealing {{that she did not}} wear underwear. Ruth Biery, a reporter for Photoplay magazine, later wrote that while visiting the actress at home, she witnessed Vélez [...] "parading before a mirror — showing off herself to herself as openly and unconsciously as small children show off before company." ...|$|E
2500|$|WMMS {{during this}} period would {{play a key role}} in {{breaking}} several major acts in the U.S., including: Rush, Roxy Music, Bruce Springsteen, Southside Johnny, Fleetwood Mac, Meat Loaf, the Pretenders, the New York Dolls, Lou Reed, Mott the Hoople, Boston, and Cheap Trick. [...] Of special note was the early support of Bruce Springsteen by Kid Leo and others, prior to the release of the Born to Run album. [...] For the station's tenth anniversary in 1978, WMMS hosted and broadcast a live Springsteen concert at the Agora Theatre and Ballroom independent of his concert tour. [...] Heavily bootlegged, the concert further cemented the relationship between the two in fans' minds, and well into the 2000s Cleveland remains one of Springsteen's strongest bases. [...] Right up until his departure in 1988, Kid Leo played [...] "Born to Run" [...] as his signature sign-off song every <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>at</b> 5:55 to kick off the weekend for area listeners.|$|E

2500|$|EMI {{released}} the five-CD box set Bassey – The EMI/UA Years 1959–1979 in 1994. The accompanying booklet {{opened with a}} poem by Marc Almond. Bassey collaborated with Chris Rea in the film La Passione (1996), appearing in the film as herself and releasing the single [...] "'Disco' La Passione". The remix of this single charted just outside the UK top 40. Bassey's [...] "History Repeating" [...] (1997), written for her by the Propellerheads, reached No. 1 on the UK Dance Chart, and No. 10 on the US Dance Chart. It was also a Top 10 hit in Italy. The liner notes of the Propellerheads' album Decksandrumsandrockandroll included the lines: [...] "We would like to extend our maximum respect to Shirley Bassey for honouring us with her performance. We are still in shock...." [...] Bassey celebrated her 60th birthday in 1997 with two open-air concerts, at Castle Howard and Althorp Park, and another TV special. The resulting live album The Birthday Concert received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance. On 7 October 1998 in Egypt, Bassey performed for a benefit at an open-air concert close to the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid. Bassey played the <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>at</b> Henley festival in 1984.|$|E
2500|$|Guns N' Roses headlined the <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>at</b> Reading Festival 2010 {{and closed}} Leeds Festival two days later. Guns N' Roses was 58 minutes late {{coming on to}} the stage, and because of a curfew issued by Reading Council the band's set ended at midnight. The band was {{therefore}} not able to complete its set, but nevertheless attempted to play [...] "Paradise City" [...] without amplification while the audience sang along. Rose orchestrated fan frustration toward the organizers, telling fans that the group would not play at the Leeds Festival. However, two days later the band played the final night of the Leeds Festival, coming onto stage 30 minutes late, and cutting part of the encore, with Rose stating to the crowd, [...] "We come here to play for you but the cops and the promoters wanna fuck us in the ass. We would like to play a few more songs for you but we'll just play one." [...] During a concert on September 1, in Dublin, the band was over an hour late arriving on stage. Rose stopped the band {{in the middle of}} the second song, [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] after multiple bottles were thrown on stage, warning the crowd [...] "One more bottle and we go home. It's up to you. We would like to stay. We want to stay. We want to have some fun." [...] After another bottle was thrown, the band left the stage during the fourth song of the set. The band returned to the stage an hour later to finish the show.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} season, Boyd {{became one}} of League One's top goalscorers and formed a strong partnership with fellow striker Joel Porter to help Hartlepool make the play-offs. He scored 29 goals in league and cup matches and became the club's highest goalscorer since Joe Allon in 1991. Arguably Boyd's best goal came against Sheffield Wednesday, on a cold, wet and windy <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>at</b> Victoria Park. [...] With Hartlepool already 2-0 up, Boyd received the ball outside the box and faked his way past two players before curling a shot over Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper David Lucas with the outside of his boot for his hat-trick. This goal earned him two awards, Hartlepool United's Goal of the Season 2005 and the North East Goal of the Season 2005. Boyd was also named Hartlepool United's Players’ Player of the Year. Boyd ended the season strongly and scored a brace in {{the first leg of}} the play-off semi final match against Tranmere Rovers. This helped to secure Hartlepool's place in the play-off finals {{for the first time to}} forge a reputation for his goalscoring exploits, which has won him admirers such as Alan Shearer. His team mates likened him to his childhood idol Dennis Bergkamp. As Boyd was acclaimed, his value went up to £1 million and he attracted the attention of FA Premier League clubs such as Newcastle United, Liverpool, Middlesbrough and Sunderland. However, Boyd remained in Hartlepool's club for the start of the 2005–06 campaign. Boyd started the season by scoring two goals in four starts, but later picked up a long-term injury against Yeovil Town after bruising his bone. To make matters worse, Boyd's injury treatment went badly as he contracted a blood infection, which resulted him being out for five months. Former manager Mike Newell, then of Luton Town, sought to take advantage of the effect that his injury had had on his value and made Hartlepool two offers thought to be of approximately £500,000 that the club quickly rejected. After finally returning to full training, Boyd struggled to overcome the effects of his injury and spent the majority of the time on the sidelines as the season drew to a close.|$|E
