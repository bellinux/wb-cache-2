6000|$|... "They don't {{know the}} right sort; besides, if I lay, no, lie <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> I can't work and study, and earn my drawers." ...|$|E
6000|$|Prickly Porky slowly {{shook his}} head. [...] "No," [...] said he. [...] "I've been right <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and I haven't seen any such creature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' {{said the}} Face, 'I have been <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> But I have made money, and when I die I am {{going home to}} be buried.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They tell you," [...] pursued Shelton, [...] "that {{we learn}} to be gentlemen up here. We learn that better through one {{incident}} that stirs our hearts than we learn it <b>here</b> in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> we're up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who is {{that just}} gone out of the house? As I live, it's Fortunatus! He seems to have {{forgotten}} that his phaeton has been <b>here,</b> waiting <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> I bet you two to one he has been losing to Castlewood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, children," [...] said he. [...] "Now you can {{sit here}} and see the people come on board. It is a very funny thing to see. I am going after the trunk. You must not mind if I don't come back for a long <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> ship will not sail yet for two hours. You must stay <b>here,</b> however, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> You must not go away from this place on any consideration." ...|$|R
60|$|CANDIDA. I {{know what}} you have done--as well as if I had been <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Oh, it was unworthy! You are like a child: you cannot hold your tongue.|$|E
6000|$|... "By Jove--I {{had quite}} {{forgotten}} my sweet-faced cousin, and that she's <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time!</b> ... and my old schoolmaster, too." [...] His words about his schoolmaster had, perhaps, less zest in them than his words concerning his cousin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello!" [...] {{cried the}} boy, seeing the captain {{looking up at}} him, [...] "we {{might as well have}} this flying <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> There is nobody to hurt us now, and we want people to know where we are." ...|$|E
6000|$|CLEOPATRA (in mortal {{dread of}} him, {{but with her}} utmost cajolery). Nothing, dearest Caesar. (With sickly sweetness, her voice almost failing) Nothing. I am innocent. (She {{approaches}} him affectionately) Dear Caesar: are you angry with me? Why {{do you look at}} me so? I have been <b>here</b> with you <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> How can I know what has happened? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very disagreeable if our {{marriage}} {{is to be}} put off by it. I {{think it will be}} so much nicer making love somewhere on the Rhine than having snatches of it <b>here,</b> and talking <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> about wills and tenements and settlements." [...] As he said this, with his arm round her waist and his face quite close to hers,--shewing thereby that he was not altogether averse even to his present privileges,--she forgave him.|$|R
6000|$|... "But you must. The present {{situation}} is intolerable. You must decide quickly, for Evan must go. You realize that. Or you must go. You both cannot continue on <b>here.</b> Take <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in <b>the</b> world. Send Evan away. Or, suppose {{you go and}} visit Aunt Martha for a while. Being away from both of us might aid you to get somewhere. Perhaps {{it will be better}} to call off the hunting. I'll go alone, and you stay and talk it over with Evan. Or come on along and talk it over with him as you ride. Whichever way, I won't be in till late. I may sleep out all night in one of the herder's cabins. When I come back, Evan must be gone. Whether or not you are gone with him will also have been decided." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I am. I {{like this}} {{place in the}} daytime, but it gives me the pip at night. It's so quiet. How you can stand it <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> I can't understand. Two nights of it would have me seeing things.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was my {{own that}} I meant," [...] said Ermine. [...] "But, Rose, always {{remember}} {{that a person who}} stands plain speaking from one like me has something very noble and generous in her. Were you <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> Rosie? I don't wonder you were tired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should think," [...] said Peter with a {{great deal}} of dignity, [...] "that you might at least believe what Jerry Muskrat and I, who live <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> tell you. We ought to know Farmer Brown's boy if any one does, and we tell you that he won't harm a feather of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} say good-bye," [...] he declared, [...] "because, {{although}} I am <b>here</b> waiting <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> I {{do not believe that}} the hour has come for me to go. It will be soon but not just yet. When we first met, I thought that I should like to take you with me. I thought that the life in what will become practically a new country, would appeal to you. Since then I have changed my mind. I have thought of my own career, and I have seen that it is not the life or career for a young man to follow. The adventures of the worker in the cities are a little grayer, perhaps, than those which come to the man who is born a wanderer, but they lead home just as surely--perhaps more safely. Au revoir!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{and see me}} soon again, dear Janet," [...] said Mrs. Douglas lovingly, {{when they}} left. [...] "You don't come half often enough. But then I suppose John will be {{bringing}} you <b>here</b> to stay <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> one of these days." [...] Anne, happening to glance at John Douglas, as his mother spoke, gave a positive start of dismay. He looked as a tortured man might look when his tormentors gave the rack the last turn of possible endurance. She felt sure he must be ill and hurried poor blushing Janet away.|$|R
60|$|We {{got here}} Tuesday evening {{and are now}} pretty well settled. Can we not expect Mr. Corbin, you, Mary and two {{children}} down {{to spend a few}} days with us as soon as the latter arrives? If Mary does not come now, it is not probable that she will get East again this summer. You can see just as much of her here as you could at your own house; so I think the best arrangement will be for you to come immediately <b>here</b> and <b>all</b> spend <b>the</b> <b>time</b> together at <b>the</b> Branch. I will go up to meet you in the harbor if informed in time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain," [...] he declared, [...] "I am ashamed. He {{has been}} <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and we've let him slip through our fingers. Girls," [...] {{he went on}} briskly, turning towards Laura, who had just come up, [...] "India's off. We'll catch this barge, if there's time. Our luggage can be put on shore when the boat docks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Course you do, an we won't {{have any}} talk 'bout it either. I 'lowed you'd stay longer'n you did, and so {{wanted you to}} take the whole of the cash; but you wouldn't, an' we're pardners jest the same's if you'd been <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> 'cause your money was in town even if you wasn't." ...|$|E
60|$|Death {{was staring}} {{her in the}} face <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> but no matter; she dearly loved to make these English-hearted Frenchmen squirm, and {{whenever}} they gave her an opening she was prompt to jab her sting into it. She got great refreshment out of these little episodes. Her days were a desert; these were the oases in it.|$|E
60|$|I've got {{the first}} volume {{launched}} safely; consequently, half of the suspense is over, and I am that much nearer the goal. We've bound and shipped 200,000 books; and by the 10th shall finish and ship the remaining 125,000 of the first edition. I got nervous and came down to help hump-up the binderies; and I mean to stay <b>here</b> pretty much <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> till <b>the</b> first days of March, when the second volume will issue. Shan't have so much trouble, this time, though, if we get to press pretty soon, because we can get more binderies then than are to be had {{in front of the}} holidays. One lives and learns. I find it takes 7 binderies four months to bind 325,000 books.|$|R
60|$|But may be {{you can not}} see {{the wild}} extravagance of my panorama. You could if you were here. <b>Here,</b> you feel <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> just as if you were living about the year 1200 before Christ--or back to the patriarchs--or forward to the New Era. The scenery of the Bible is about you--the customs of the patriarchs are around you--the same people, in the same flowing robes, and in sandals, cross your path--the same long trains of stately camels go and come--the same {{impressive}} religious solemnity and silence rest upon the desert and the mountains that were upon them in the remote ages of antiquity, and behold, intruding upon a scene like this, comes this fantastic mob of green-spectacled Yanks, with their flapping elbows and bobbing umbrellas! It is Daniel in the lion's den with a green cotton umbrella under his arm, all over again.|$|R
5000|$|The American author Amy Elizabeth Smart visited several Latin American {{countries}} in 2011 {{to see where}} Austen stood {{in that part of}} the world. In Mexico, where Smart asked a group of local women if the plot of Sense and Sensibility had any relevance in modern Mexico, she was told: [...] "No, the book's really relevant...Things then, in her country, are just the same way here and now. Look at Willoughby, taking advantage of women. Men <b>here</b> do that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> And Marianne, marrying more for the sake of being married than for being in love. Women are here are afraid to be single. It is very hard". In Ecuador, Smart discovered that Ecuadoran men <b>all</b> detested <b>the</b> character of Mr. Darcy with one man telling her Darcy deserved [...] "Es de matarlo a palos" [...] ("to be beaten to death with a stick") while Ecuadoran women were much more fond of the character, saying he did not deserved to be beaten to death with a stick as their menfolk were insisting upon. The Ecuadorans tended to regard Austen as more of a fantasy writer, describing life in Regency England that was simply inconceivable in modern Ecuador, with one reader of Pride and Prejudice telling Smart that none of the characters from that book would last a day in Guayaquil.|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS. Your {{daughter}} had {{the audacity to}} come to my house and ask me to teach her how to speak properly so that she could get a place in a flower-shop. This gentleman and my housekeeper have been <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> [Bullying him] How dare you come here and attempt to blackmail me? You sent her here on purpose.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was shot}} up here by an accident," [...] I said. [...] "There was no fight at all. Except to keep honest, perhaps and I made no great figure in that. I {{and my uncle}} mixed a {{medicine}} and it blew us up. No merit in that! But you've been <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Tell me {{what you have done}} first." ...|$|E
6000|$|To Muriel in her {{loneliness}} {{even such}} companionship as that {{was indeed a}} consolation. [...] "Oh, I'm so glad you told him," [...] she cried. [...] "If {{we have to stop}} here long, before a ship takes us off, it'll be so nice to have you <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> with me. You won't go away from me ever, will you? You'll always stop with me!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> girls {{began talking}} at <b>the</b> same <b>time,</b> and {{without waiting for}} the intelligence, favouring one another with their guesses of its import.|$|R

6000|$|Peter's face brightened. [...] "I {{should say}} I did!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "He {{stopped for a}} few days on his way north. I only wish he would stay <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> But he seems to think there is no place like the Great Woods of the North. I could listen all day to his song. Do you know what he always seems to be saying?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course we've left Broomleys," [...] {{she told}} them, [...] "but we are {{staying with the}} Medlingcourts {{for three or four}} days. They asked us at the last moment. And then your letter came, Letitia--just in time. I'm simply crazy to come and stay with you. Letitia, you lucky girl! You are going to be <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time!</b> I am simply foolish about him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't care a bit," [...] said Bab, {{swinging}} {{on one of}} {{the ropes}} with a happy-go-lucky air, for her spirits were not extinguished yet, and she was bound to enjoy this exciting holiday to the very end. [...] "I like circuses so much! I wish I lived <b>here</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and slept in a wagon, as you did, and had these dear little colties to play with." ...|$|E
