40|$|This Briefing {{provides}} an overview of hospitalised injury due to <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders. Injurious <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders requiring admission to hospital occurred at a rate of 18. 5 per 100, 000 population in the year to June 30 2005 (n= 3, 486). Two-thirds of hospitalised injury incidents due to <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders in this year resulted in fractures and more than 40 % of <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders occurred in the home. Rates increased markedly with age and, unlike most other types of <b>fall</b> injuries, <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> ladders were more common for older males than for older females. Both the number and the rate of injurious ladder-related falls have increased for older Australians in recent years...|$|R

5|$|Cirrus clouds often produce hair-like filaments—similar to the virga {{produced}} in liquid–water clouds—called fall streaks, {{and they are}} made of heavier ice crystals that <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> the cloud. The sizes and shapes of fall streaks {{are determined by the}} wind shear.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Falls</b> <b>from</b> height {{can occur}} {{throughout}} a grain handling facility. Data has illustrated that relatively short <b>falls,</b> <b>from</b> 12 to 20 feet, can be fatal. Examples of surfaces that could present a falling hazard to grain handling employees might include floors, machinery, structures, roofs, skylights, unguarded holes, wall and floor openings, ladders, unguarded catwalks, platforms and manlifts. Additionally, workers are also exposed to potentially fatal falls {{as they move}} from the vertical exterior ladders on grain bins to the bin roof or through a bin entrance.Between 1985 and 1989, <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> heights were the second leading cause of grain-handling worker fatalities [...]Falls from machinery and structures were the second largest single cause of grain- and silage-handling fatalities between 1985 and 1989; <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> structures accounted for 79 percent of these fatalities [...] Data has illustrated that relatively short <b>falls,</b> <b>from</b> 12 to 20 feet, can be fatal [...]|$|R

Sagredo (taken to be {{the younger}} Galileo) cannot {{understand}} why with machines one cannot argue from the small to the large: [...] "I do not see that the properties of circles, triangles and...solid figures should change with their size". Salviati (speaking for Galileo) says the common opinion is wrong. Scale matters: a horse <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> a height of 3 or 4 cubits will break its bones whereas a cat <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> twice the height won't, nor will a grasshopper <b>falling</b> <b>from</b> a tower.|$|R
