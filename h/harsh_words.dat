5|$|Taylor and his Secretary of State, John M. Clayton, both lacked {{diplomatic}} experience, {{and came}} into office at a relatively uneventful time in American–international politics. Their shared nationalism allowed Taylor to devolve foreign policy matters to Clayton with minimal oversight, although no decisive foreign policy was established under their administration. As opponents of the autocratic European order, they vocally supported German and Hungarian liberals in the revolutions of 1848, although they offered {{little in the way}} of aid. A perceived insult from the French minister Guillaume Tell Poussin nearly led to a break in diplomatic relations until Poussin was replaced, and a reparation dispute with Portugal resulted in <b>harsh</b> <b>words</b> from the Taylor administration. In a more positive effort, the administration arranged for two ships to assist in the United Kingdom's search for a team of British explorers, led by John Franklin, who had gotten lost in the Arctic. While previous Whig administrations had emphasized Pacific trade as an economic imperative, the Taylor administration took no major initiative in the Far East.|$|E
5|$|While ashore {{during the}} peace Macnamara {{contrived}} to become {{embroiled in a}} duel. While walking his Newfoundland dog in Hyde Park on 6 April 1803 he had an altercation with Colonel Robert Montgomery, when their dogs began fighting. <b>Harsh</b> <b>words</b> were exchanged, and the two parties fought a duel that evening at Chalk Farm. Both men were wounded, the colonel mortally. Macnamara was arrested {{on a charge of}} manslaughter and put on trial at the Old Bailey on 22 April. Macnamara defended himself from the charge on the grounds that he had received an affront and that it was necessary for him to challenge it in order to maintain his position as a naval officer. He summoned many of his naval friends, among whom Viscounts Hood and Nelson, Lord Hotham, Sir Hyde Parker, Sir Thomas Troubridge, Captains Martin, Towry, Lydiard, Moore and Waller; and General Churchill and Lord Minto, to testify in his defence. They supported his assertion that he was the 'reverse of quarrelsome' and the jury took ten minutes to acquit him.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} at 02:52 UTC. During the initial climb, the Captain tested {{the knowledge of}} the First Officer, and used <b>harsh</b> <b>words</b> in snobbish tones while speaking to him. This was very contrary to Airblue's procedures. The lecture continued for about one hour, with only brief intervals. After the humiliating session, the First Officer remained mostly silent {{throughout the rest of the}} flight, likely from a loss of self esteem and confidence. Subsequently, the First Officer did not challenge the Captain over any of his errors or violations.|$|E
25|$|Mushtaq captained Northamptonshire between 1975 and 1977, and in 1976 led {{the side}} to victory in the Gillette Cup, the county's first-ever trophy, and to {{second place in the}} County Championship, equalling its best-ever position. But his {{captaincy}} ended in some controversy. According to Wisden 1978 edition, Mushtaq resigned, claiming that his future had not been made clear and that there were rumours – {{which turned out to be}} true – that former captain Jim Watts was to be reappointed for 1978. Mushtaq had in any case signed for the Packer venture in Australia, but there were <b>harsh</b> <b>words</b> from the county's chairman about dressing room politics and Mushtaq did not play for Northants again.|$|E
25|$|By the 1900s {{the whole}} line was under {{pressure}} from overcrowding. The populations of areas along the line, particularly at Hornsey, Highgate, Muswell Hill, and Finchley, had increased considerably with the rapid Victorian expansion of London, but the GNR service had not been expanded to cope. The line was also congested with goods traffic, mostly coal and building materials. By 1903 the morning trains from Barnet were full {{by the time they}} arrived at East Finchley. As the doors of the compartments in the carriages were in those days locked with aid of a simple square key, some passengers took to purchasing these keys from local ironmongers, and locking the doors from the inside. It was not unknown for <b>harsh</b> <b>words</b> and even, on odd occasions, for blows to be exchanged.|$|E

25|$|Ten {{weeks after}} passing Cape Horn, the Boston reached Woody Point in Nootka Sound. Salter {{decided to stop}} {{a few miles from}} any {{habitation}} to get wood and water. The next morning, 13 March 1803, several people from Nootka village, including Maquinna, came aboard to trade. (Jewitt throughout his memoirs refers to Maquinna as a king, and those subordinate to him as chiefs.) Because of the frequent British and American trading ships, Maquinna had learned enough English to communicate. Generally, there was cordiality and friendliness between his people and the visiting ships, although Captain Salter took the precaution of having them searched for weapons before allowing them to come aboard. Salter gave Maquinna a fowling piece (shotgun) as a present, which was somehow broken, leading to <b>harsh</b> <b>words</b> from the captain and suppressed rage on the part of Maquinna, who decided to take revenge for offences committed by previous European ships over the years.|$|E
25|$|The stanza {{begins with}} a celebration of divine power, and then {{abruptly}} shifts to a darker, more allusive train of thought, featuring condemnation of a renowned poet, Archilochus, Grown fat on the <b>harsh</b> <b>words</b> of hate. Archilochus was an iambic poet, working within a genre that licensed abusive and scurrilous versea regrettable tendency {{from the viewpoint of}} Pindar, whose own persona is intensely earnest, preaching to Hieron the need for moderation (wealth with wisdom) and submission to the divine will. The reference to the embittered poet appears to be Pindar's meditative response to some intrigues at Hieron's court, possibly by his rivals, condemned elsewhere as a pair of ravens (Olympian 2). The intensity of the stanza suggests that it is the culmination and climax of the poem. In fact, the stanza occupies the middle of Pythian 2 and the intensity is sustained throughout the poem from beginning to end. It is the sustained intensity of his poetry that Quintilian refers to above as a rolling flood of eloquence and Horace below refers to as the uncontrollable momentum of a river that has burst its banks. Longinus likens him to a vast fire and Athenaeus refers to him as the great-voiced Pindar.|$|E

After begging the queen to stop sleeping with Claudius, Hamlet leaves, dragging Polonius's corpse away.|$|E

500|$|This small scandal, with Magoon at the center, was {{termed the}} [...] "Magoon Incident" [...] by the Chicago Tribune and {{resulted}} in <b>harsh</b> <b>words</b> against him from both parties.

Democrats similarly were against the second version of the report. It is unclear which version, if any, actually represented Magoon's personal views rather than the views of the current secretary of war.|$|E

Odin mentions the location Þrymheimr sixth in a single stanza. In the stanza, Odin details that the jötunn Þjazi once lived there, and that now his daughter Skaði does. Odin describes Þrymheimr as consisting of [...] "ancient courts" [...] and refers to Skaði as [...] "the shining bride of the gods". In the prose introduction to the poem Skírnismál, the god Freyr has become heartsick for a fair girl (the jötunn Gerðr) he has spotted in Jötunheimr. The god Njörðr asks Freyr's servant Skírnir to talk to Freyr, {{and in the first}} stanza of the poem, Skaði also tells Skírnir to ask Freyr why he is so upset.

However, he received little support. Despite being forced out of power, Khánh refused to entertain the concept, calling Thi through an intermediary and informing him of his removal from the command of I Corps. The deposed leader's attempted command was met with <b>harsh</b> <b>words</b> from Thi.

The martini was developed to mark completion of a major 29-day renovation that closed the hotel for the first time since its opening. Hoy Wong was a notable bartender at the hotel and was the oldest person to hold such a position in the state, serving at the Algonquin for 30 years until retiring in 2009, well past the age of 90.|$|E

Although the album features several songs with aggressive guitar riffs that {{are reminiscent of}} the band's previous releases, {{as seen in the}} tracks [...] "On My Rockin' Machine", [...] "Long Green" [...] and [...] "Mantra Down", it also contains slow-paced and guitar-driven ballads like [...] "Livin' Large" [...] and [...] "Freezer Burn".

[...] Slap-Happy also contains songs that borrow elements from genres other than rock. For example, the song [...] "Little One" [...] contains elements of both polka and country music.

500|$|Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi {{promoted}} {{the principle of}} Ahimsa, very successful by applying it to all spheres of life, particularly to politics (Swaraj). His non-violent resistance movement satyagraha had an immense impact on India, impressed public opinion in Western countries, and influenced the leaders of various {{civil and political rights}} movements such as the American civil rights movement's Martin Luther King, Jr. and James Bevel. In Gandhi's thought, Ahimsa precludes not only the act of inflicting a physical injury, but also mental states like evil thoughts and hatred, unkind behavior such as <b>harsh</b> <b>words,</b> dishonesty and lying, all of which he saw as manifestations of violence incompatible with Ahimsa. Gandhi believed Ahimsa to be a creative energy force, encompassing all interactions leading one's self to find satya, [...] "Divine Truth". Sri Aurobindo criticised the Gandhian concept of Ahimsa as unrealistic and not universally applicable; he adopted a pragmatic non-pacifist position, saying that the justification of violence depends on the specific circumstances of the given situation. Sri Aurobindo also indicated that Gandhi's Ahimsa led to partition of India as it blocked the forceful action that the Indian people were engaged in during the 1920s and 30s, which caused delay in independence, allowing other forces to take root, including those who wanted India divided.|$|E
