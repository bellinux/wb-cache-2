Focusing the attention on ISO Drafts, a deeper analysis aims at evaluating if the revision of the existing standards coherently refers to GPS principles, also considering examples of application of the described rules. A methodology collecting the main guidelines, which have to be considered when revising or developing GPS standards on Datums, is thus proposed. On the basis of the chain links concepts, some guidelines are defined, aiming at ensuring the rule of unambiguity, the rule of totality and the rule of complementarity, according to the GPS Masterplan. Moreover, it is underlined the need of maintaining a “high degree of applicability” of the standards, avoiding the risk of developing just an elegant collection of rules...|$|R

The NOAA website states {{the system to}} have been developed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and published material that does state an origin apparently based on that account. However, a series of aerial photos found in the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv (the military section of the German Federal Archives) apparently dating from 1943-1944 bear the inscription UTMREF followed by grid letters and digits, and projected according to the transverse Mercator, a finding that would indicate that something called the UTM Reference system {{was developed in the}} 1942-43 time frame by the Wehrmacht. It was probably carried out by the Abteilung für Luftbildwesen (Department for Aerial Photography). From 1947 onward the US Army employed a very similar system, but with the now-standard 0.9996 scale factor at the central meridian as opposed to the German 1.0. For areas within the contiguous United States the Clarke Ellipsoid of 1866 was used. For the remaining areas of Earth, including Hawaii, the International Ellipsoid was used. The WGS84 ellipsoid is now generally used to model the Earth in the UTM coordinate system, which means current UTM northing at a given point can differ up to 200 meters from the old.

Theories have been refined and new technologies have been developed and enhanced, which in turn have advanced our understanding of geodesy and our ability to make use of this information. Chapter Two of the Technical Aspects of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (TALOS) manual has recently been updated to capture the effects of these geodetic changes on LOS activities, which are summarised in this paper. Through the International Association of Geodesy, global scientific organisations have developed conventions for spatial and temporal reference systems and realisations of these systems, as well as conventions for the use of geodetic technology and techniques. Improvements in space geodesy techniques, such as GPS, Very Long Baseline Interferometry, Satellite Laser Ranging, and several satellite gravity missions have fundamentally improved our understanding of geodetic reference surfaces such as the geoid and reference ellipsoid, spurring ever more accurate global horizontal and vertical geodetic <b>datums,</b> <b>systems</b> and frames. This paper will concentrate on the implications of these geodetic advances on maritime boundary delimitation.

40|$|AbstractThe datum {{reference}} frame (DRF) is an orthogonal coordinate system used {{to locate the}} geometric features in tolerance technology and is a fundamental tool for tolerance analysis, tolerance validation and tolerance inspection.

This paper presents {{the concept of a}} construction element of the DRF and the composition principle of DRF using the construction element. In this approach, the DRF is decomposed into three construction elements, i. e., a point, a line passing through the point, and a plane containing the line, and DRF is established by determining these three construction elements. The rules and algorithms used to determine the construction elements are established and the construction elements can be automatically established from the datum feature according to the rules and algorithm. The composition rules of the DRF are defined with the construction elements, and the DRF can be constructed automatically. The notion of and the establishment method for the construction elements can be used to validate the datum validity and the completeness of the <b>datum</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

In order to compare these definitions and ascertain their reliability, a new geometric frame composed of ideal mica points, mica joins (segments), substitution vectors and substitution planes is constructed to express the entire substitution system of ideal Fe-A 1 -Li micas. The frame is built in composition space with the coordinate system (0; Si, Alvb Abv, Fe 2 +, Li, [[]vi, K), but has a 3 -dimensional analogue, i. e. a visual image. Using this frame, it has been proved {{that there are only}} five possible types of replacement for definitions of Fe-Li micas, and that all possible types have been suggested except he Aliv-constant. Furthermore, it has been proved that the main point in different definitions i that the replacement of Li by Fe 2 + needs to be balanced with Alw, Alvi, or Ulvi. In order to solve this problem, a set of formulae determining spatial relations between geometric elements in the frame is suggested. With these formulae, the abstract frame is suggested to be a <b>datum</b> <b>system</b> used to ascertain quantitatively the reliability of definition of natural Fe-Li micas...|$|E

40|$|As {{concerns}} {{the use of}} RTCM observation correction data in GNSS positioning services, the coordinates are resulting within the ITRF or in a regional ITRF-realization (e. g.

The users of GNSS services must however normally present their results in the coordinates of regional or local horizontal and vertical <b>datum</b> <b>systems.</b> Therefore, coordinate transformations are necessary. Currently, the pre-calculated transformation parameters and/or geoid-models have to be transferred in advance to GNSS controllers in particular ways. The aim of the transformation messages of the recent 2007 RTCM 3. 1 was to define transformation algorithms and data structures by seven RTCM transformation messages, which allow the GNSS service to transmit respective RTCM transformation messages to the user of the GNSS service. In that way and by the transformation messages’ use in the GNSS-controllers, the above ITRF-based coordinates can automatically be transformed to the desired horizontal datum and height reference system, and the above preparation of a data transfer and further manual operations during the GNSS-measurement become obsolete. The software and communication architecture for the use the RTCM transformations messages in a GNSS service can be realized as a server-client concept. The desired reference transformations are implemented within the so-called transformation modules {{and as part of}} the RTCM transformation messages server. In that way, the NMEA-position of the GNSS-rover is used as the basic server request and it is passed through the administrating GNSS networking software to the RTCM transformation messages server. Depending on the configuration of the RTCM transformation messages server, different transformation modules are activated and different message design specifications are holding. Accordingly one or several binary RTCM transformation messages are generated and send via the GNSS network software back to the client of the GNSS-controller...|$|R

40|$|The {{orthometric height}} (OH) system {{plays a key}} role in geodesy, and it has broad {{applications}} in various fields and activities. Based on general relativity theory (GRT), on an arbitrary equi-geo- potential surface, there does not exist the gravity frequency shift of an electromagnetic wave signal. However, between arbitrary two different equi-geopotential surfaces, there exists the gra- vity frequency shift of the signal. The relationship between the geopotential difference and the gravity frequency shift between arbitrary two points P and Q is referred to as the gravity frequency shift equation. Based on this equation, one can determine the geopotential difference as well as the OH difference between two separated points P and Q either by using electromagnetic wave signals propagated between P and Q, or by using the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite signals received simultaneously by receivers at P and Q. Suppose an emitter at P emits a signal with frequency f towards a receiver at Q, and the received frequency of the signal at Q is, or suppose an emitter on board a flying GPS satellite emits signals with frequency f towards two receivers at P and Q on ground, and the received frequencies of the signals at P and Q are and, respectively, then, the geopoten-tial dif- ference between these two points can be determined based on the geopotential frequen- cy shift equation, using either the gravity frequency shift ? f or ?, and the corresponding OH difference is further determined based on the Bruns’ formula.
