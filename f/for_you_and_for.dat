500|$|In the New Testament, the messianic {{expectations}} {{found in}} early Judaism were fulfilled {{on the day}} of Pentecost as recorded in Acts. The Christian community was gathered together in Jerusalem when a sound from heaven like rushing wind was heard and tongues like tongues of flame rested on everyone. They were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues, miraculously praising God in foreign languages. A crowd gathered and was addressed by the Apostle Peter who stated that the occurrence was the fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel 2, [...] "And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy". He then explained how the Spirit came to be poured out, recounting Jesus’ ministry and passion and then proclaiming his resurrection and enthronement at the right hand of God. In response, the crowd asked Peter what they should do. He responded that they should repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of sins in order to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Peter finished his speech stating that the promise [...] "is <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself".|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{made his}} first post-illness public {{appearance}} on July 9, when he surprised the Senate by showing up to supply the added vote to break a Republican filibuster against a bill to preserve Medicare fees for doctors. Though additionally ill from an attack of kidney stones and {{against the advice of}} some associates, Kennedy insisted on appearing during the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 25, 2008, where a video tribute to him was played. Introduced by his niece, Caroline Kennedy, the senator said, [...] "It is so wonderful to be here. Nothing– nothing– is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight." [...] He then delivered a speech to the delegates (which he had to memorize, as his impaired vision left him unable to read a teleprompter) in which, reminiscent of his speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, he said, [...] "this November, the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans. So, with Barack Obama and <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> me, our country will be committed to his cause. The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on." [...] The dramatic appearance and speech electrified the convention audience, as Kennedy vowed that he would be present to see Obama inaugurated.|$|E

As he had done in 1830, he chose a man he was certain would soon fail; [...] Adolphe Thiers. On the subject of Thiers, Louis-Philippe told Victor Hugo, [...] "He (Thiers) has spirit, but he is spoiled by {{the spirit of a}} parvenu; [...] he has shown himself to be insatiable." [...] Louis Philippe cited what he said was Talleyrand's view of Thiers: [...] "You will never make anything of Thiers, but nonetheless he will be an excellent instrument. But he is one of those men whom you can make use of only if you give them satisfaction; but he is never satisfied.

2500|$|In these {{difficult}} times {{the one person}} who continuously provided moral support to Pisemsky was Ivan Turgenev. In 1869 he informed Pisemsky that his One Thousand Souls had been translated into German and enjoyed [...] "great success in Berlin". [...] "So now {{the time has come for}} you to step outside the borders of your motherland and for Aleksey Pisemsky to become a European name," [...] Turgenev wrote on October 9, 1869. [...] "The best Berlin critic, Frenzel, in National Zeitung devoted a whole article to you where he calls your novel 'a rare phenomenon', and I tell you, now you are well known in Germany," [...] wrote Turgenev in another letter, enclosing clips from other papers, too. [...] "The success of One Thousand Souls encourages [...] to start upon the novel Troubled Seas and I am so happy both <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> Russian literature in general… Critical reviews of One Thousand Souls here in Germany are most favourable, your characters are being compared to those of Dickens, Thackeray, etc, etc", he continued. Julian Schmidt’s large article in Zeitgenossensche [...] Bilder, part of the series devoted to first class European authors, provided for Pisemsky another cause to celebrate, and following Turgenev's advice, in 1875 he visited Schmidt to thank him personally.|$|E
