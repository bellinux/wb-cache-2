5|$|The now {{independent}} association maintained the racial segregation with four separate associations. After consultation with Baden-Powell, four separate Scouting organisations {{were created in}} 1936. These were The Boy Scouts Association (for whites), The African Boy Scouts Association (for blacks), The Coloured Boy Scouts Association (for coloureds) and The Indian Boy Scouts Association (for Indians). A revision of the 1936 constitution in 1953 even strengthened the whites-only branch: its Chief Scout was now Chief Scout of the three other associations, with each association providing a Chief Scout's Commissioner as executive <b>head</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Chief Scout.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{believes}} the {{figures to be}} the ghosts of Quint and Jessel, seeking to continue their passionate and violent sexual encounters through Miles and Flora. However, she is concerned to find that others apparently cannot see the ghosts. She then begins to suspect that Miles and Flora, having been groomed by and involved {{in the activities of}} Quint and Jessel, may be deliberately seeking to bring the pair back. She resolves to leave Bly, but, when saying goodbye to Miles, learns that he, too, sees the figures. Minutes after leaving, she asks to be taken back. Later, Ann panics, believing Miles and Flora to have left the house. She finds them by the lake, but they are playing roughly; when Miles pushes Flora's <b>head</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> water, Ann sees the pair as Quint and Jessel. She rushes to intervene, and grapples with the figure which alternates between Quint and Miles. When Ann repeatedly strikes Miles, Mrs Grose stops her, and Flora says that she no longer wishes to see Ann. After ordering the staff and Flora away from Bly, Ann waits with Miles to confront Quint. The pair are scared, but when Quint arrives Ann tells Miles to demand that Quint leave him alone. Miles (speaking with Quint's voice) shouts at Ann, but eventually (in his own voice) tells the ghostly Quint that he wishes him to leave. Ann embraces Miles, whose body goes limp.|$|E

All production aircraft were powered by a (2,590hp/1,932kW) Centaurus V driving a 12ft 9 inch (3.89 m) diameter Rotol propeller.

25|$|In 1196 Torre Abbey {{was founded}} as a Premonstratensian Monastery by William Brewer.

The monastery itself was partly built with quarried stone from nearby Corbyn <b>Head</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> {{permission}} of the De Cockington family of nearby Cockington manor. It remained that way until February 1539 when it suffered the same fate as all other monasteries, surrendering to the ministers of Henry VIII during {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries following his split from Rome. The canons of Torre Abbey founded the nearby town of Newton Abbot in the early thirteenth century as the New Town of the Abbots.|$|E

25|$|John Alexander and James Dodd as Johann Krauss: Krauss is a German psychic whose ectoplasmic {{being is}} {{contained}} in a suit after a botched séance. Originally, filmmakers planned to create a computer-generated version of the glass fishbowl helmet, but with the cost being prohibitive, they created an actual helmet. To ensure the invisibility of the actor's <b>head</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> glass, perspective and mirror tricks were used. The helmet was controlled by two puppeteers, so the heavy contraption had to be shared between Alexander and Dodd. John Alexander also plays Bethmoora Goblin, a legless goblin who helps Hellboy and the team find the Angel of Death. He is the master goblin smith who forged the Golden Army. Seth MacFarlane voices the character, having taken over from Thomas Kretschmann, after del Toro decided that Kretschmann's voice and the mechanical sound effects to Johann's suit did not mesh well.|$|E
25|$|When {{foraging}} {{for food}} they will hang on branches suspended over the water, dipping their <b>head</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> {{surface of the}} water, until they encounter a fish or other prey. They are frequently found basking on these branches over water, and when approached, they will quickly drop {{into the water and}} swim away. If cornered, they will often hiss, and flatten their head or body to appear larger. They only typically resort to biting if physically harassed or handled. Its bite is known to be quite painful due to its sharp teeth meant to keep hold of slippery fish. Unfortunately, this defensive behavior is frequently misinterpreted as aggression and often leads to their being mistaken for the venomous cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus), with whom they do share habitat in some places. The brown/tan coloration and diamond-shaped pattern also causes these snakes to be mistaken for rattlesnakes, especially when encountered on land by individuals unfamiliar with snakes.|$|E
25|$|The American coot {{typically}} {{has long}} courtship periods. This courtship period {{is characterized by}} billing, bowing, and nibbling. Males generally initiate billing, which is the touching of bills between individuals. As the pair bond becomes more evident, {{both males and females}} will initiate billing only with each other and not other males or females. After a pair bond is cemented, the mating pair looks for a territory to build a nest in. A pair bond becomes permanent when a nesting territory is secured. Copulation behavior among coot pairs always falls under the same general pattern. First the male chases the female. Then, the female moves to the display platform and squats with her <b>head</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> water. The male then mounts the female, using his claws and wings to balance on the female's back while the she brings her head above the water. Sexual intercourse usually takes no longer than two seconds.|$|E

500|$|Pyramid <b>Head,</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> new moniker [...] "Bogeyman", makes a {{significant}} appearance in 2008 installment Silent Hill Homecoming, but his role {{is limited to}} non-interactive scenes, appearing only twice to the game's main protagonist Alex Shepherd (once in the Grand Hotel in Silent Hill and, much later, in a church, where he executes Alex's father by splitting him in half). His last appearance is in a possible ending to the game: Alex wakes up in a wheelchair as two Pyramid Heads appear, each with part of a helmet, which they use to turn Alex into one of them. After this ending is played, the player obtains the Bogeyman's costume for Alex to wear. Mindful of Pyramid Head's role in Silent Hill 2, the developers chose to include him as [...] "the embodiment of a myth [...] parents started to keep the children out of trouble" [...] and [...] "the accretion of the activities {{going on in the}} town of Shepherd’s Glen." ...|$|E
500|$|Chapter five, [...] "Survivals, revivals and reinterpretations", {{continues}} Merrifield's {{exploration of}} ritual practices in Christian Europe. He examines Late- and Post-Medieval items {{that have been}} deposited in rivers, including swords and pilgrimage souvenirs, speculating that their deposition might represent a survival from the pagan tradition of casting votive offerings into water. He speculates that the contemporary practice of throwing a coin into a fountain for good luck is a further survival of the custom. He then discusses the evidence for ritual foundation deposits under buildings, noting the widespread Medieval deposition of an animal's head or jaw in a construction's foundations, presumably for protective magical purposes. Proceeding {{to deal with the}} Late- and Post-Medieval deposition of pots under foundations, he looks at their place in churches, where it was believed that they aided the acoustics. Continuing with this theme, he discusses the British folk custom of burying a horse's <b>head</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> floor to improve a building's acoustics, speculating as to whether this was a survival of the pagan foundation deposit custom. Rounding off the chapter, Merrifield examines at magical items that have been intentionally placed in the walls, chimneys and roofs of buildings in Britain, in particular the widespread use of dead cats and old shoes.|$|E
500|$|Elements of {{the music}} video for [...] "We Found Love" [...] have been {{compared}} to the works of Britney Spears, Eminem and Madonna. The scene in which Rihanna and O'Shaughnessy blow marijuana exhalations into each other's mouths is stylistically reminiscent of the cover artwork on English musician Tricky's 2001 album Blowback. Rihanna's video was compared to the video for Spears' song [...] "Everytime" [...] (2004). Critics noted that Rihanna lay in a bathtub and submerged her <b>head</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> water, which {{can be interpreted as}} a failed suicide attempt. In [...] "Everytime", Spears is shown as a successful singer constantly bothered by the media and paparazzi about her turbulent relationship with her boyfriend. In [...] "Everytime"s video, Spears drowns in a bathtub {{as a result of a}} concussion. Rihanna's video also bears resemblances to that for Eminem and Rihanna's [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] (2010); both contain lyrical and visual content about a doomed relationship and scenes of graphic violence and substance abuse. Like [...] "We Found Love", [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] displays scenes of a couple in various stages of undress and intimacy. [...] "We Found Love"s video includes stylistic references to Madonna's video for [...] "Ray of Light" [...] (1998). James Montgomery of MTV News noted that [...] "Ray of Light"s video features [...] "a whole lot of high-speed, time-lapse shots taken in cities around the world", the same technique used for the drug scenes in [...] "We Found Love".|$|E

The album was accompanied by a tour, which featured Johnette Napolitano as the vocalist. Byrne took legal action against the rest of the band to prevent them using the name [...] "Talking Heads", something he saw as [...] "a pretty obvious attempt {{to cash in on the}} Talking Heads name". They opted to record and tour as [...] "The Heads". Likewise, Byrne continues his solo career.|$|E
