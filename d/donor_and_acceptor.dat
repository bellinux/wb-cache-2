These side-chains, to be specific Arg359, Arg528, His469, and Ser386, are conserved within each transketolase enzyme and interact with the phosphate group of the <b>donor</b> <b>and</b> <b>acceptor</b> substrates. Because the substrate channel is so narrow, the <b>donor</b> <b>and</b> <b>acceptor</b> substrates cannot be bound simultaneously.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study shows}} that {{intramolecular}} hydrogen bonding in proteins depends on the accessibility of <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>acceptors</b> to water molecules. The frequency of occurrence of H-bonded side chains in proteins is inversely proportional to the solvent accessibility of their <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>acceptors.</b> Estimates of the notional free energy of hydrogen bonding suggest that intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions of buried <b>and</b> half-buried <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>acceptors</b> can contribute favorably to the stability of a protein, whereas those of solvent-exposed polar atoms become less favorable or unfavorable...|$|R

2500|$|Most {{eukaryotic}} {{cells have}} mitochondria, which produce ATP from {{products of the}} citric acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and amino acid oxidation. At the mitochondrial inner membrane, electrons from NADH and FADH2 pass through the electron transport chain to oxygen, which is reduced to water. The electron transport chain comprises an enzymatic series of electron donors and acceptors. Each electron donor will pass electrons to a more electronegative acceptor, which in turn donates these electrons to another acceptor, a process that continues down the series until electrons are passed to oxygen, the most electronegative and terminal electron acceptor in the chain. Passage of electrons between <b>donor</b> <b>and</b> <b>acceptor</b> releases energy, {{which is used to}} generate [...] a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane by actively [...] "pumping" [...] protons into the intermembrane space, producing a thermodynamic state that has the potential to do work. The entire process is called oxidative phosphorylation, since ADP is phosphorylated to ATP using the energy of hydrogen oxidation in many steps.|$|E

40|$|The laser {{performance}} of rare earth doped crystals and glasses can be significantly improved by codoping with an addiontal ion which absorbs the pump light and efficiently transfers {{the energy to}} the lasing rare earth ion. Such methods {{have been used in}} chromium-neodymium doped gadolinium scandium gallium garnets, glasses and glass ceramics, and manganese-thulium doped lead zinc gallium fluoride glasses. Energy transfer between <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>acceptors</b> in such materials has been traditionally modeled by the Foerster-Dexter equation. However, it has been found recently that an anomalous energy transfer can occur at very short times inconsistent with the above model. We propose that such transfer can occur due to two additional causes: 1. the physical pairing of <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>acceptors</b> in the materials and 2. additional short-range interactions which noticeably increase the transfer rate between <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>acceptors.</b> Models for both these cases are presented and compared with experimental results. 1...|$|R

The system has a certain probability to jump from the initial to the final potential energy curves. In the adiabatic case the coupling is considerable, the gap of 2 HAB is larger and the system stays on the lower potential energy curve.|$|E

In transport or optics, these properties are typically masked by defect-induced bulk carriers. Compensation of <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>acceptors</b> reduces the carrier density, but the bulk resistivity remains disappointingly small. We show that {{measurements of the}} optical conductivity in BiSbTeSe$_ 2 $ pinpoint the presence of electron-hole puddles in the bulk at low temperatures, which is essential for understanding DC bulk transport. The puddles arise from large fluctuations of the Coulomb potential of <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>acceptors,</b> even {{in the case of}} full compensation. Surprisingly, the number of carriers appearing within puddles drops rapidly with increasing temperature and almost vanishes around 40 K. Monte Carlo simulations show that a highly non-linear screening effect arising from thermally activated carriers destroys the puddles at a temperature scale set by the Coulomb interaction between neighbouring dopants, explaining the experimental observation semi-quantitatively.
