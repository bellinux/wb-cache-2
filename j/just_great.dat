500|$|Two songs, [...] "Low Down Freedom" [...] and [...] "Black Rose," [...] were {{produced}} by Ronny Light. [...] "We Had It All" [...] {{was produced by}} Jennings and Ken Mansfield. [...] Like the music within, the album cover was also {{at odds with the}} elaborate, often overwrought cover designs from Music Row, featuring an unpretentious shot of a smiling Jennings and his unkempt friends sat around a studio laughing and drinking. [...] In a 2008 interview with Dan MacIntosh, Shaver said of the LP, [...] "Oh, it was great, because the songs were bigger than me. And I couldn't possibly sing as good as Waylon.

[...] Sciannamea concluded his review, [...] "What makes this show so great is that the supporting players {{have a chance to}} shine at the right moments.

This meant their breach of the law had happened largely due to an exculpating mistake of fact on the part of Morrow, who intended to end the stunt before crossing into restricted territory, but who received no explicit indications as to where that territory began − and was indeed waved farther into it by the police. The ABC welcomed this development; Morrow commented: [...] "I think it's <b>just</b> <b>great</b> that justice hasn't been done". The police remained unapologetic.|$|E

500|$|Copland {{acknowledged}} that the acoustics at the premiere were [...] "shrill." [...] While Philharmonic Hall was being renovated in 1976 {{in an attempt to}} improve its sound, Harold C. Schonberg wrote, [...] "For all we know, Connotations is a masterpiece. But one thing is certain—it did not make many friends for Lincoln Center in 1962." [...] While admitting the work was [...] "written in Copland's austere, objective, abstract style," [...] he suggested that bad acoustics might have also played a part in the work's failure at the premiere. The orchestra that night had been augmented by a large chorus to perform the first movement of Gustav Mahler's Eighth Symphony, which pushed the orchestra forward, [...] "out of its normal playing position... The sound was bad, bad. The bass response was sorely deficient, the hall was plagued with echoes, the musicians on stage reported that they could not hear each other very well (<b>just</b> <b>great</b> for ensemble) and in general Philharmonic Hall sounded like a cheap hi-fi set with the bass speakers out of the circuit.|$|E

500|$|Kariya {{was known}} for his skilled and {{entertaining}} style of play. An offensive player, he was a fast skater with strong puck-handling and passing abilities. Prior to and early in his NHL career, Kariya drew comparisons to Wayne Gretzky. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, American Head Coach Tim Taylor likened his skating and playmaking ability to Gretzky's, while Kariya's linemate, Chris Kontos, described his on-ice vision as [...] "Gretzky-like." [...] Canadian Head Coach Tom Renney heralded him as [...] "think and play at a better speed than anybody else," [...] adding that his teammates [...] "are usually a half-step behind him." [...] His speed made him particularly adept in international competition, as games were played on a larger ice surface in comparison to the NHL. Following his first NHL goal against Winnipeg, Jets Head Coach John Paddock told reporters, [...] "like with Gretzky the puck seems to following him around... It looks like he's cherry-picking, but he's not. That's <b>just</b> <b>great</b> instinct." [...] Kariya himself cited Gretzky, as well as Brett Hull, Jeremy Roenick and Pavel Bure as players he liked patterning his game after. Kariya was also recognized for his [...] "hockey sense" [...] and the cerebral aspect of his game, which included analyzing the game at a high level. His first NHL coach, Ron Wilson, also once described Kariya as [...] "the hardest-working athlete [...] ever been associated with." ...|$|E

Advertising Age said of the piece: [...] "A flawless DGI production to an irresistible piece of music propelling a brilliant, astonishingly witty new iteration of a longstanding, unique positioning. This isn't <b>just</b> <b>great</b> advertising; it is perfect advertising." [...] Gastón Bigio, Executive Creative Director for Del Campo Nazca Saatchi & Saatchi remarked on the campaign {{in the run-up to}} the festival, saying [...] "noitulovE is, in my opinion, the best. [...] This execution is absolutely incredible, as is the production." [...] The main competition for the prize was thought to be the Australian [...] for Carlton draught beer, and the British Balls, for Sony's BRAVIA line of high definition television sets. After the three received Gold Lions in the Film category, they were shortlisted by the judges as contenders for the Grand Prix. Ultimately, the honour went to noitulovE. After the decision, David Droga, president of the jury which determined the outcome, said [...] "It's a very very strong ad. A lot of the jurors felt that it was not only a stand-alone, remarkable ad, but also a triumphant return for a fabulous campaign." [...] The victory placed director Daniel Kleinman at Number29 in The Independent's list of the Top 50 Newsmakers of 2006.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} [...] "B+". While {{he had been}} {{disappointed}} with several episodes since the show's mid-season break, VanDerWerff noted: [...] "Glee still has its inconsistencies, but it's {{getting back to the}} show I so enjoyed last fall." [...] He wrote of the Sean storyline that it: [...] "should feel offensive but mostly skates away from actually being so because it treats the paralyzed character {{with a great deal of}} respect". Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle also noted that he had been underwhelmed with the show since its return, but loved [...] "Laryngitis", writing: [...] "The story focused exclusively on the kids—not Mr. Shue or Sue Sylvester—and the performances were realistically small-scale. [...] All that classic Glee charm came washing over me once more and it was glorious." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times similarly stated: [...] "When Glee is at its best, you get episodes like this week's. There were no gimmicks, no over-the-top productions, no unnecessary stars [...] It was <b>just</b> <b>great</b> storytelling and superb finger-snapping music." [...] Vanity Fair Brett Berk deemed [...] "Laryngitis" [...] a [...] "truly successful episode", but also highlighted the show's inconsistency in quality since its return. James Poniewozik of Time called [...] "Laryngitis" [...] the first episode of Glee since its mid-season break that he enjoyed [...] "(mostly) without reservation." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 8.8/10, deeming it one of his favorite episodes of Glee, [...] "with some of the funniest material the show has delivered thus far." ...|$|E
500|$|To help {{train the}} dog playing Vincent for the episode's needed scenes, Madison {{was given the}} fake arm to take home and play with; when finally brought on the set, the crew had {{difficulty}} shooting her because Madison would bring and drop off the arm slightly differently each time, causing trouble recreating the same camera angles. Actor Daniel Dae Kim described their scenes with the beer in the DVD special features, [...] "The comedic scenes with Josh were {{so much fun to}} play because it was a lighter side. A nice change of pace." [...] Like their characters, the actors had not been in scenes together in a while, so Dae Kim thought it [...] "was fun to catch up and have fun in the process". The episode featured Hurley driving a bus down a hill. To create this scene, Garcia had to drive the bus down a small hill [...] "very stead" [...] to ensure the cameraman could record it all; towards the end however, they told Garcia to just [...] "go for it", allowing him to [...] "cut loose a little". For the close-up shots of Garcia and Dominic Monaghan, the production crew would shake the bus to simulate driving, and brush various pieces of foliage across the windshield to make it seem the bus was hitting bushes or trees. A stunt double standing in for Garcia performed the largest hill in the drive down; they were unable to rehearse due to getting rained out, so their first rehearsal was done on film. Dae Kim commented that [...] "it was <b>just</b> <b>great</b> to have as much fun on camera as we do off camera", {{and that there was no}} real acting that day, as they were all enjoying themselves as much as their characters. The Volkswagen campus van — still in operating condition — along with Hurley's Camaro, were later auctioned off with other Lost props and costumes at the Santa Monica Airport in 2010.|$|E
