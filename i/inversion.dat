5|$|Green Lantern Coaster {{begins with}} a u-turn out of the station. It ascends a chain lift hill before going down a small dip and into an s-bend {{followed}} by a u-turn. After a slight ascent, the car enters a 120.5° drop – the steepest in the southern hemisphere. The track then returns to approximately two thirds of its original height before entering {{the first set of}} block brakes. These brakes lead into a left turn with reverse or outward banking. It then drops under the block brakes and into the first <b>inversion</b> – a Dive Loop. The <b>inversion</b> begins with half of an inline twist which transitions into half of a vertical loop. Upon exiting the <b>inversion</b> the track inclines into a second set of block brakes. The train then goes around a right u-turn and into the second <b>inversion</b> – a downwards inline twist. This leads into a cutback-style turnaround before entering the final brake run and returning to the station.|$|E

40|$|Many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forth to explain the origin and spread of <b>inversions,</b> and their significance for speciation. Several recent genic models have proposed that <b>inversions</b> promote speciation with gene flow due to the adaptive significance of the genes contained within them {{and because of the}} effects <b>inversions</b> have on suppressing recombination. However, the consequences of <b>inversions</b> for the dynamics of genome wide divergence across the speciation continuum remain unclear, an issue we examine here. We review a framework for the genomics of speciation involving the congealing of the genome into alternate adaptive states representing species ("genome wide congealing"). We then place <b>inversions</b> in this context as examples of how genetic hitchhiking can potentially hasten genome wide congealing. Specifically, we use simulation models to (i) examine the conditions under which <b>inversions</b> may speed genome congealing and (ii) quantify predicted magnitudes of these effects. Effects of <b>inversions</b> on promoting speciation were most common and pronounced when <b>inversions</b> were initially fixed between populations before secondary contact and adaptation involved many genes with small fitness effects. Further work is required on the role of underdominance and epistasis between a few loci of major effect within <b>inversions.</b> The results highlight five important aspects of the roles of <b>inversions</b> in speciation: (i) the geographic context of the origins and spread of <b>inversions,</b> (ii) the conditions under which <b>inversions</b> can facilitate divergence, (iii) the magnitude of that facilitation, (iv) {{the extent to which the}} buildup of divergence is likely to be biased within vs. outside of <b>inversions,</b> and (v) the dynamics of the appearance and disappearance of exceptional divergence within <b>inversions.</b> We conclude by discussing the empirical challenges in showing that <b>inversions</b> play a central role in facilitating speciation with gene flow...|$|R

5|$|If two of {{the three}} given circles do not intersect, a center of <b>inversion</b> can be chosen so that those two given circles become concentric. Under this <b>inversion,</b> the {{solution}} circles must fall within the annulus between the two concentric circles. Therefore, they belong to two one-parameter families. In the first family (Figure7), the solutions do not enclose the inner concentric circle, but rather revolve like ball bearings in the annulus. In the second family (Figure8), the solution circles enclose the inner concentric circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the algebraic solution.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{two studies}} further pinpointed the {{responsible}} region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-Mb covering chromosomal rearrangement. The scientists {{were able to}} show that the first genetic change happened 3.8 million years ago on the resident chromosome, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. This <b>inversion</b> created the faeder allele. About 500,000 years ago another rare recombination event of faeder and resident allele in the very same inverted region lead to the satellite allele. The 4.5 Mb <b>inversion</b> covers 90 genes, {{one of them is the}} centromere coding gene N- CENPN-, which is located exactly at one of the <b>inversion</b> breakpoints. The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the <b>inversion</b> is homozygous lethal. Over the course of the past 3.8 million years, further mutations have accumulated within the <b>inversion</b> i.e. three deletions ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 kb. Two of these deletions remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- HSD17B2 and SDR42E1-both holding important roles in metabolism of steroid hormones. Hormone measurements around mating time showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase of testosterone, faeders and satellites only experience higher androstenedione levels, a substance which is considered an intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis. The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a cis-acting regulatory mutation which is altering the expression of one or both genes and eventually contributes to the different male phenotypes and behaviour.|$|E

50|$|Cytogenetic {{techniques}} {{may be able}} {{to detect}} <b>inversions,</b> or <b>inversions</b> may be inferred from genetic analysis.

The prevalence and significance of T-wave <b>inversions</b> in adolescent athletes, the group most vul-nerable to exercise-related sudden death from cardiomyopathy, is unknown.

5|$|In general, any three {{distinct}} circles {{have a unique}} circle—the radical circle—that intersects all of them perpendicularly; {{the center of that}} circle is the radical center of the three circles. For illustration, the orange circle in Figure6 crosses the black given circles at right angles. <b>Inversion</b> in the radical circle leaves the given circles unchanged, but transforms the two conjugate pink solution circles into one another. Under the same <b>inversion,</b> the corresponding points of tangency of the two solution circles are transformed into one another; for illustration, in Figure6, the two blue points lying on each green line are transformed into one another. Hence, the lines connecting these conjugate tangent points are invariant under the inversion; therefore, they must pass through the center of <b>inversion,</b> which is the radical center (green lines intersecting at the orange dot in Figure 6).|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} approach, the radii of the given circles are {{modified}} appropriately by an amount Δr so {{that two of}} them are tangential (touching). Their point of tangency is chosen as the center of <b>inversion</b> in a circle that intersects each of the two touching circles in two places. Upon <b>inversion,</b> the touching circles become two parallel lines: Their only point of intersection is sent to infinity under <b>inversion,</b> so they cannot meet. The same <b>inversion</b> transforms the third circle into another circle. The solution of the inverted problem must either be (1) a straight line parallel to the two given parallel lines and tangent to the transformed third given circle; or (2) a circle of constant radius that is tangent to the two given parallel lines and the transformed given circle. Re-inversion and adjusting the radii of all circles by Δr produces a solution circle tangent to the original three circles.|$|E

5|$|A {{natural setting}} for problem of Apollonius is inversive geometry. The basic {{strategy}} of inversive methods is to transform a given Apollonius problem into another Apollonius {{problem that is}} simpler to solve; the solutions to the original problem are found from the solutions of the transformed problem by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations must change one Apollonius problem into another; therefore, they must transform the given points, circles and lines to other points, circles and lines, and no other shapes. Circle <b>inversion</b> has this property and allows the center and radius of the <b>inversion</b> circle to be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the Euclidean plane isometries; however, they do not simplify the problem, since they merely shift, rotate, and mirror the original problem.|$|E
