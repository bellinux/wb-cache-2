5|$|According to Michel Samaha, Lebanon's {{minister}} of information, Hezbollah <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legitimate resistance {{organization that has}} defended its land against an Israeli occupying force and has consistently {{stood up to the}} Israeli army.|$|E
5|$|Among Jehovah's Witnesses the Star of Bethlehem <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{product of}} Satan, {{rather than a}} sign from God, since the star led the astrologers to Jerusalem where they met King Herod's plan to kill Jesus.|$|E
5|$|China’s rise {{as a major}} {{trading partner}} has been cited as a {{potential}} reason for Russia’s loss of control over Central Asian economies. The union <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way to counterbalance China’s growing trade in Central Asia and the European Union’s Eastern Partnership.|$|E

50|$|Independence can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{special kind}} of {{conditional}} independence, since probability can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kind of conditional probability given no events.|$|R
40|$|When {{modelling}} a domain, it {{is often}} the case that certain individuals are represented as belonging to multiple categories, generating therefore "tangled" hierarchies: 1. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> amount of matter 2. <b>A</b> hole can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> region of space 3. <b>A</b> building can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> place 4. A biological organ can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> aggregate of molecules 5. An association can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group of people 6. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> temporal process This phenomenon is quite common: the examples above have been taken from existing toplevel ontologies used in practice, and they are responsible, in our opinion, of many situations of tangleness, confusion, and lack of semantic rigour. We advocate in the present paper a design principle aimed to clarify such situations and produce more reusable and well-founded ontologies. It can be stated as follows: Ontological Distinction Principle: Classes corresponding to different ident...|$|R
5|$|In {{category}} theory, disjoint union <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{particular case}} of the coproduct operation, and general coproducts {{are perhaps the most}} abstract of all the generalizations of addition. Some coproducts, such as Direct sum and Wedge sum, are named to evoke their connection with addition.|$|E
5|$|In modern Polish historiography the battle's outcome <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> victory, if a {{very costly}} one, for the Polish and Soviet troops. As noted by historians such as Wawer and Komorowski, despite the heavy casualties, the Polish–Soviet {{frontline}} was not seriously breached, {{and thus the}} German offensive was a failure.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{interest}} in loam construction has revived {{in the developed}} world. It <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way to minimize use of fossil fuels and pollution, particularly carbon dioxide, during manufacture, {{and to create a}} comfortable living environment through the high mass and high absorption of the material.|$|E
50|$|After WWII {{women were}} {{discouraged}} from entering into engineering. During the war, their efforts <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> patriotic duty. After the war, women in engineering <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> abnormality.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> bicone can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{polyhedral}} {{limiting case}} of an n-gonal bipyramid where n approaches infinity. It can also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dual of <b>a</b> cylinder <b>as</b> <b>an</b> infinite-side prism.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{statement}} can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{support of}} the harmony between the teachings and Chán. The second statement can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> support of a [...] "special transmission outside the teachings".|$|R
5|$|Note: The 1911 Inter-Empire Championships held in London <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{precursor}} to the modern Commonwealth Games, but is not normally considered an official edition of the Games themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree sparrow}} <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pest in some areas. In Australia, it damages many cereal and fruit crops and spoils cereal crops, animal feed and stored grain with its droppings. Quarantine rules {{prohibit}} {{the transport of}} this species into Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|At the 2012 Olympics, {{there were}} two sports for women only: {{synchronized}} swimming and rhythmic gymnastics. That netball is also played mostly by women <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> drawback. Netball does allow for mixed teams, but the Olympics did not include mixed sex team sports. Rugby sevens and golf, primarily played by men, were chosen {{for inclusion in the}} 2016 Summer Olympics for both sexes ahead of netball.|$|E
50|$|Dom Peters <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> shining {{example for}} all inner-city {{children}} {{wanting to get}} into professional sport after coming through the Broncos youth system. He <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> highly promising winger when injury-free.|$|R
5000|$|It can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {4/2} antiprism; with {4/2} being a tetragram, a {{compound}} of two dual digons, and the tetrahedron <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> digonal antiprism, this can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> compound of two digonal antiprisms.|$|R
50|$|As the {{displacement}} can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mechanical analogue of electric charge, the absement can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mechanical analogue of the time-integrated charge, a quantity useful for modelling {{some types of}} memory elements.|$|R
5|$|Despite this, {{the seat}} of the European Parliament remains controversial. The work of Parliament is divided between Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, which <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> problem due to the large number of MEPs, staff, and {{documents}} which need to be moved. As the locations of the major seats have been enshrined in the treaties of the European Union, Parliament has no right to decide its own seat, unlike other national parliaments.|$|E
5|$|In December 1887, Woodford {{contracted}} septicaemia from an untreated foot injury. He died on 23 December. He <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{pioneer of}} the Authentic school of masonic research, applying proper historical methodology {{in place of}} carelessly repeated fable. He earnestly collected and studied early masonic manuscripts, writing the introduction for Hughan's published collection. He contributed greatly {{to an understanding of}} the enigmatic history of the York lodges in the eighteenth century. His lasting legacy may be seen in the continued activity and influence of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, and the rational approach to masonic history.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the other worlds of the Hainish universe, the relationship between Athshe and the League of Worlds is portrayed as ambiguous. Whereas with planets such as Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness the integration with the Hainish planets <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> good thing, Athshe is seen as changed for the worse both by the loggers and by being taught to kill their own species. The League eventually decides to isolate Athshe and limit all contact with it, a decision shown to have ambiguous overtones.|$|E

30|$|As already {{explained}} in [12], RS can also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of non-orthogonal multi-user transmission. Indeed, in its simplest form, the common message in RS can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> non-orthogonal layer added onto the private layers.|$|R
50|$|The crossed square cupola may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{part of some}} uniform polyhedra. For example, {{the great}} cubicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> six crossed square cupolae {{connected}} at their triangular faces, while the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> blend of six cupolae. Additionally, the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> octagrammic prism with the octagrams excavated with crossed square cupolae, similarly to how the rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> octagonal prism with the octagons augmented with square cupolae. Rotating one of the cupolae in this construction results in the pseudo-great rhombicuboctahedron. To this may be added the great rhombihexahedron, as the exclusive or of {{all three of these}} octagrammic prisms which may be used to construct the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron.|$|R
5|$|In the {{internal}} chronology of the Hainish universe, {{the events of}} The Word for World is Forest occur after The Dispossessed, in which both the ansible and the League of Worlds are unrealised dreams. However, the novel is located prior to Rocannon's World, in which Terran mindspeech <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> distinct possibility. A date of 2368 CE has been suggested by reviewers, although Le Guin provides no direct statement of the date.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale {{has been}} used for {{industrial}} purposes since the early 17th century, when it was mined for its minerals. Since the late 19th century, shale oil has also been used for its oil content and as a low grade fuel for power generation. However, barring countries having significant oil shale deposits, its use for power generation is not particularly widespread. Similarly, oil shale is a source for production of synthetic crude oil and it <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> solution towards increasing domestic production of oil in countries that are reliant on imports.|$|E
5|$|Other {{than the}} {{national}} flag, anthem and emblem, Belarus has several unofficial symbols. The Cross of Saint Euphrosyne, a 12th-century relic which disappeared during the Second World War is considered a spiritual symbol of Belarus. The European bison, commonly called the wisent, <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbol of Belarus and the Belavezha Forest. It is also featured on the symbols of Brest Oblast. An other widely known mascots of Belarus are stork and cornflower.|$|E

50|$|A {{possibility}} measure can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> consonant plausibility {{measure in}} Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence.

5|$|Outside Poland, Sienkiewicz's {{popularity}} declined {{beginning in}} the interbellum, except for Quo Vadis, which retained relative fame thanks to several film adaptations, including a notable American one in 1951. In Poland his works are still widely read; he <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> classic author, and his works are often required reading in schools. They have also been adapted for Polish films and television series.|$|E
5|$|Sarvapitri amavasya (all ancestors' {{new moon}} day) is {{intended}} for all ancestors, irrespective of the lunar day they died. It {{is the most important}} day of the Pitru Paksha. Those who have forgotten to perform shraddha can do so on this day. A shraddha ritual performed on this day is considered as fruitful as one conducted in the holy city of Gaya, which <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> special place to perform the rite, and hosts a fair during the Pitru Paksha period.|$|E
5|$|The {{fight at}} P'ohang-dong {{was the final}} {{breaking}} point for North Korean units already {{on the verge of}} exhaustion from continuous combat. North Korean supply lines were overextended to the point of breaking down, causing a collapse in resupply that <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> primary factor in turning the tide of the battle. Moreover, U.S. air superiority was also crucial to the engagement, since repeated bombing runs by U.S. aircraft prevented North Korean ground forces from reaching and holding their objectives.|$|E
50|$|He was {{considered}} a moderate in his views. At the conclave of 1963, Confalonieri <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> possible candidate for a transitional pope, one who {{is not likely to}} effect great change during his tenure. Yet his lack of pastoral experience <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hindrance.|$|R
