5|$|In Okinawa, about 30,000 {{people were}} {{evacuated}} from low-lying areas near rivers which threatened to overflow their banks. At least 50 flights {{in and out}} of the prefecture were also cancelled or delayed. Already hit by Typhoon Nari just a few days prior to Wipha, South Korea began evacuating residents as the remnants of the typhoon were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the country. Rainfall was expected to impact South Korea for several days with accumulations exceeding 150mm (6in). About 940 people were evacuated to shelters throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Damage in {{the state}} totaled to over $13billion (2004 USD). Charley {{initially}} was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> further north in Tampa, and caught many Floridians off-guard due to a sudden change in the storm's track as it approached the state. Throughout the United States, Charley caused 10deaths and $15.4billion in damage to insured residential property, making it the second costliest hurricane in United States history at the time (it has since dropped to ninth). Charley was a compact, fast-moving storm, which limited the scope and severity of the damage.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} prior to hitting Dominica, David was {{originally}} <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> Barbados and spare Dominica in the process. However, on August 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the 150 mph (240 km/h) hurricane to make a direct hit on {{the southern part of}} Dominica. Even as it became increasingly clear that David was headed for the island, residents did not appear to take the situation seriously. This can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population. This proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation.|$|E

25|$|Ties That Bind did {{not sell}} {{as well as}} expected, and sold {{significantly}} less than the original game. In November, 2005 Midway announced it would miss its quarterly expectations, specifically citing poor sales of Ties That Bind and L.A. Rush. Midway <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> its $30 million revenue target, but expected loses to reach $29 million instead of the previously anticipated $19 million, blaming increased product development costs. For the fiscal year, their revenue expectations dropped from $200 million to $145 million, with expected losses of $95 million. The company ultimately reported a $29.1 million quarterly loss on revenues of $29.5 million.|$|E

The viewer-player in {{par for the}} course <b>expects</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> the ball into the cup of each hole. But, I purposefully made the course extremely challenging, if not impossible, to play. By doing so, I have magnified the artificiality of miniature golf by conflating competition to the point of absurdity.

50|$|The {{pharmaceuticals}} industry <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be <b>hit</b> by spoilage {{concerns as}} the stock they manufacture in the UK is time sensitive, and expires quickly, while {{not being able to}} ship to overseas customers.

25|$|Production {{of tobacco}} leaf {{increased}} by 40% between 1971, when 4.2 {{million tons of}} leaf were produced, and 1997, when 5.9 million tons of leaf were produced. According to the Food and Agriculture organization of the UN, tobacco leaf production was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> 7.1 million tons by 2010. This number is a bit lower than the record-high production of 1992, when 7.5 million tons of leaf were produced. The production growth was almost entirely due to increased productivity by developing nations, where production increased by 128%. During that same time, production in developed countries actually decreased. China's increase in tobacco production was the single biggest factor in the increase in world production. China's share of the world market increased from 17% in 1971 to 47% in 1997. This growth can be partially explained by {{the existence of a}} high import tariff on foreign tobacco entering China. While this tariff has been reduced from 64% in 1999 to 10% in 2004, it still has led to local, Chinese cigarettes being preferred over foreign cigarettes because of their lower cost.|$|E

Officials closed schools in Dhofar Governorate. The storm ultimately passed the country to the southwest, sparing the feared impacts from the cyclone. But first it was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> Salalah,Oman. All because of the wind direction change, the wind movement of the cyclone moved towards Yemen.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, as {{baseball}} expanded, NFL football had been surging in popularity, making it economical {{for many of}} these cities to build multi-purpose stadiums instead of single-purpose baseball fields. Because of climate and economic issues, many of these facilities had playing surfaces made from artificial turf, as well as the oval designs characteristic of stadiums designed to house both baseball and football. This often resulted in baseball fields with relatively more foul territory than older stadiums. These characteristics changed the nature of professional baseball, putting a higher premium on speed and defense over home-run hitting power, since the fields were often too big for teams <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> many home runs and foul balls hit in the air could more easily be caught for outs.|$|R
2500|$|Natural gas {{is mainly}} {{converted}} in to LNG to achieve [...] {{the natural gas}} transport over the seas where laying pipelines is not feasible technically and economically. LNG achieves a higher reduction in volume than compressed natural gas (CNG) so that the (volumetric) energy density of LNG is 2.4times {{greater than that of}} CNG (at 250 bar) or 60 percent that of diesel fuel. This makes LNG cost efficient in marine transport over long distances. However, CNG carrier can be used economically up to medium distances in marine transport. Specially designed cryogenic sea vessels (LNG carriers) or cryogenic road tankers are used for its transport. LNG is principally used for transporting natural gas to markets, where it is regasified and distributed as pipeline natural gas. It can be used in natural gas vehicles, although it is more common to design vehicles to use compressed natural gas. Its relatively high cost of production and the need to store it in expensive cryogenic tanks have hindered widespread commercial use. [...] Despite these drawbacks, on energy basis LNG production is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> 10% of the global crude production by 2020.(see LNG Trade) ...|$|E
