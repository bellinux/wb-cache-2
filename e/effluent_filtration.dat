40|$|Abstract—Although the estrogenic hormones 17 b-{{estradiol}} and 17 a-ethinyl estradiol can {{be quantified}} in polluted waters by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS), the compounds often are present at concentrations below detection limits. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) provide a sensitive and robust means of quantifying estrogenic hormones in wastewater effluents and surface waters. Results from ELISA analysis of estrogenic hormones in secondary wastewater effluent indicate concentrations comparable to those that cause vitellogenesis in fish. Confirmatory analyses by GC/MS/MS are consistent with ELISA results. <b>Effluent</b> <b>filtration,</b> using sand filtration or microfiltration, removes approx. 70 % of the hormones from secondary effluent, while advanced treatment, using reverse osmosis, removes more than 95 % of hormones. The detection limits for estrogenic hormones are approx. 0. 1 ng/L in wastewater effluent and 0. 05 ng/L in surface water. The ELISA technique provides a relatively simple and practical method of assessing the fate of estrogenic hormones in engineered and natural systems.

40|$|Ultrafiltration (UF) {{membranes}} {{have been}} increasingly {{used for the}} pretreatment of secondary effluent in reverse osmosis wastewater reclamation plants. The fouling behavior of UF membranes during secondary <b>effluent</b> <b>filtration</b> was studied under constant pressure conditions in a cross flow filtration unit. The rate of flux decline {{was found to be}} strongly dependent on the permeate flux level, and drastic flux decline was observed at high flux during the initial period of filtration (within the first 30 min of each fouling test). Further flux decline was insignificant and a limiting flux behavior was observed. Membranes with high initial flux (>the limiting value) approached asymptotically to an identical stable flux, i. e., the limiting flux. The stable flux was strongly affected by solution chemistry (both pH and calcium concentration), with more severe membrane fouling occurred near the isoelectrical point of the foulant (pH 6) or at greater calcium concentration. Zeta potential measurements revealed that the stable flux may be correlated to the square of zeta potential of fouled membrane samples. The current study seems to suggest that foulant-foulant electrostatic repulsion plays a significant role in membrane fouling by effluent organic matter. © 2011 Desalination Publications.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Horizontal {{roughing}} filters (HRF) can properly remove {{suspended solids}} and microorganisms from surface water resources, especially on filtration rates less than 1. 5 m/h. This research {{was aimed at}} suspended solid removal efficiency of HRF during secondary wastewater <b>effluent</b> <b>filtration.</b> Methods: This experimental study was conducted by installing an HRF pilot system on effluent pumping station of Qom wastewater treatment plant based on aerated lagoon process. The pilot was a horizontal cylindrical column consisting of three compartments filled with river gravels in various sizes. Grab samples were simultaneously taken from HRF inlet and outlet in three filtration rates: 0. 5, 1, and 1. 5 m/hResults: The results indicated that filtration rate {{had a significant effect}} on the amount of total suspended solids in HRF effluent. During optimum operation of HRF, removal efficiencies of three filtration rates (0. 5, 1, and 1. 5 m/h) were 78. 5, 63. 1, and 66. 9, respectively.

40|$|Separate {{treatment}} of black (toilet) water offers {{the possibility to}} recover energy and nutrients. In this study three combinations of biological treatment and membrane filtration were compared for their biological and membrane performance and nutrient conservation: a UASB followed by effluent membrane filtration, an anaerobic MBR and an aerobic MBR. Methane production in the anaerobic systems was lower than expected. Sludge production was highest in the aerobic MBR, followed by the anaerobic MBR and the UASB-membrane system. The level of nutrient conservation in the effluent was high in all three treatment systems, which is beneficial for their recovery from the effluent. Membrane treatment guaranteed an effluent which is free of suspended and colloidal matter. However, the concentration of soluble COD in the effluent still was relatively high and this may seriously hamper subsequent nutrient recovery by physical¿chemical processes. The membrane filtration behaviour of the three systems was very different, {{and seemed to be}} dominated by the concentration of colloidals in the membrane feed. In general, membrane fouling was the lowest in the aerobic MBR, followed by the membranes used for UASB <b>effluent</b> <b>filtration</b> and the anaerobic MBR...|$|E
40|$|Four dual media filters (DMFs) were {{operated}} in a biofiltration mode with different engineered environments (DMF I and II: coagulation with/without acidification and DMF III and IV: without/with chlorination). Designed biofilm enrichment reactors (BERs) containing the removable reverse osmosis (RO) coupons, were connected {{at the end}} of the DMFs in parallel to analyze the biofilm on the RO membrane by DMF <b>effluents.</b> <b>Filtration</b> performances were evaluated in terms of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and assimilable organic carbon (AOC). Organic foulants on the RO membrane were also quantified and fractionized. The bacterial community structures in liquid (seawater and effluent) and biofilm (DMF and RO) samples were analyzed using 454 -pyrosequencing. The DMF IV fed with the chlorinated seawater demonstrated the highest reductions of DOC including LMW-N as well as AOC among the other DMFs. The DMF IV was also effective in reducing organic foulants on the RO membrane surface. The bacterial community structure was grouped according to the sample phase (i. e., liquid and biofilm samples), sampling location (i. e., DMF and RO samples), and chlorination (chlorinated and non-chlorinated samples). In particular, the biofilm community in the DMF IV differed from the other DMF treatments, suggesting that chlorination exerted as stronger selective pressure than pH adjustment or coagulation on the biofilm community. In the DMF IV, several chemoorganotrophic chlorine-resistant biofilm-forming bacteria such as Hyphomonas, Erythrobacter, and Sphingomonas were predominant, and they may enhance organic carbon degradation efficiency. Diverse halophilic or halotolerant organic degraders were also found in other DMFs (i. e., DMF I, II, and III). Various kinds of dominant biofilm-forming bacteria were also investigated in RO membrane samples; the results provided possible candidates that cause biofouling when DMF process is applied as the pretreatment option for the RO process...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{historical}} {{growth of the}} Las Vegas Wash, its subsequent degradation, and the current efforts to restore and stabilize its channel. The Las Vegas Valley Metropolitan Area {{is located in the}} Mohave Desert in a drainage basin surrounded by mountain ranges. This drainage basin and its dynamic system of stream channels constitute the Las Vegas Watershed in which the Wash is located. The condition of the Las Vegas Wash is unique, as is a perennial stream that evolved from an ephemeral wash in response to the rapid urbanization and subsequent production of treated wastewater input into the stream channel. The situation has created a series of wetland ecosystems along the Wash, and valuable riparian habitat in such an arid environment. The Wash and its associated wetlands system provide a variety of ecological services to the city of Las Vegas, including storm water conveyance, wastewater <b>effluent</b> <b>filtration,</b> flood protection, and a green space for residents to enjoy. However, continuous increase in volume and intensity of the stream flow has resulted in severe channel degradation and bank erosion in numerous locations along the stream channel. After an examination of the historic and present-day conditions of the Wash and its restoration activities, this essay suggests that future evaluations of the Las Vegas Wash case study may provide evidence to support the propagation of collaborative management efforts...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of wastewater treatment facilities to meet effluent standards during peak flow conditions has been neglected in the past. Facilities are frequently {{designed to accommodate}} diurnal flow variations {{on the basis of}} elimination of significant amounts of infiltration and inflow which would otherwise cause large peak flows. This often proves disappointing when the projected reductions in infiltration and inflow are not realized;Peak flows from sanitary sewer systems are handled traditionally by building flow equalization facilities or by oversizing the conventional treatment facilities. It was felt that a potential alternative to these practices would be the use of split treatment [...] diverting excess flows to less flow-sensitive treatment processes;This study sought to construct a framework by which split treatment could be considered and evaluated. High rate filtration was judged to be a process with much potential for use in split treatment. Various flow schemes using high rate filtration were examined with regard to both cost and treatment performance. This was done from both a general point of view as well as in a site-specific case study involving Ames, Iowa. Because of the many complex interrelationships involved in treatment performance, a simple computer model was written to aid in the feasibility analysis by simulating the quality of effluent produced by conventional and split treatment systems. Simplified cost formulations were developed using the CAPDET model developed by the Environmental Protection Agency;A conclusion reached in the evaluation was that split treatment using high rate filtration offers a small but significant cost savings over conventional treatment flow schemes and is most feasible when considered in conjunction with plants incorporating primary or secondary <b>effluent</b> <b>filtration</b> in which the filters {{can be used in a}} dual function mode. Under proper conditions, split treatment can be accomplished without violating effluent concentration standards for BOD and suspended solids...|$|E
40|$|The {{stormwater}} pond {{is located}} at the Florida Aquarium in Tampa and is designed to treat 4. 2 hectares (10. 4 acres) of street and urban runoff. It is an <b>effluent</b> <b>filtration</b> system that incorporates artificial side bank filters packed in aggregate to slowly release storm runoff after rain events. The pond was monitored throughout a two-year period. Year 1 includes data from November 2000 through August 2001. During this drought year 16 rain events were monitored. Monitoring was discontinued for eight months during the construction of a cruise ship terminal. Year 2 includes data from June 2002 through October 2003. The longer time period and above average rainfall resulted in water quality samples for 38 rain events. The under drains were also sampled for both flow and water quality. Load efficiency calculations were made on a monthly basis, since the rain, inflow and bypass outflow occurred only during rain events, but the under drains flowed continuously. The results indicate that the stormwater system is not effective for removing dissolved nutrients and may be dewatering the ground water. Ten percent more water left the site compared to storm event flows into the pond. Efficiency calculations on a yearly basis showed that dissolved nutrient loads increased considerably. For example, an increase of 84 percent was measured for ammonia and 64 percent for orthophosphorous when the entire system was evaluated. Other nutrient species were only moderately reduced (14 to 17 percent). In contrast, total suspended solids and most metal loads were reduced by a significant amount (79 to 89 percent). Only a few samples at the bypass outflow did not meet the State of Florida Class III water quality standards in Year one (12 % for lead), while a much greater number failed to meet standards in year two (27 % for copper, 23 % for lead and 4 % for zinc). Although higher concentrations were measured in year two, the greater number of non-compliant samples was also caused by the greater amount of rain, which made the pond water much softer and the standard more stringent.

The filter plus struvite can be composted to yield struvite-enriched compost.

Following 24 hours of aeration the pH increased to from 8. 5 to 9, providing good conditions for struvite precipitation. Filtration proved to be efficient for separating precipitated struvite and total suspended solids. The efficiency of orthophosphate phosphorus removal in the pilot system varied from 63 to 96 %, ammonia nitrogen removal varied from 22 to 79 %, but magnesium removal efficiency was low due to the high natural Mg concentration, suggesting that the addition of Mg might not be necessary.

40|$|Microfiltration (MF) {{has emerged}} as a useful process for concentrating fine {{particles}} and clarifying wastewater. The loss of membrane flux due to fouling, however, {{is one of the main}} impediments in the economical development of membrane processes for use in water and wastewater treatment. The nature and extent of fouling when used for wastewater is strongly influenced by three factors: biomass characteristics, operation conditions, and membrane characteristics. This study is an extension of a previous research on application of microfiltration in treating combined sewage overflow (CSO) and focused on the fouling mechanism of microfiltration of primary effluent and secondary effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants, the former of which was used herein to simulate CSO. A 3 -step test was designed to fractionate membrane, cake and irreversible fouling resistances in membrane filtration using a stirred dead-end cell system. The results shows that the dominating fouling mechanism for microfiltration of primary / secondary effluents is cake resistance, whereas irreversible fouling dominates the fouling of tap water filtration, indicating a totally different fouling pattern although waste tap water is regarded as one of the major component of municipal wastewater. The suspended solids in both primary and secondary effluents were investigated to be moderately compressible particles by showing a compressibility index n around 0. 4 - 0. 6. The irreversible fouling of membrane filtration, as the term suggests, is hard to be removed and results in unrecoverable permeate flux decline in practice although it occupies a comparatively small fraction of the total hydraulic resistances in sewage <b>effluent</b> <b>filtration</b> than deposited cake. A multi-cycle test was conducted to investigate how the irreversible resistance will vary over repeated cycles of membrane filtration and surface cleaning like a long-term practical application. The result of a 17 -cycle test showed that the irreversible resistance gradually increased from initial 5 % to about 21 % of total resistance after six cycles and then basically remained constant at this plateau. This study is valuable to industrial application and design of membrane processes, especially in the application of microfiltration of CSO or primary/secondary effluents as a tertiary treatment method...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Platform mussels, Mytilopsis leucophaeata from Galveston, TX were exposed to various levels of salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen and suspended solid concentrations to ascertain effects on filtration rate. Filtration rate was determined by turbidity reduction of suspensions over three hours. Sepia ink (0. 15 + 0. 034 []m) was the primary indicator for turbidity reduction. Mussels were exposed to four types of suspended particles (Sepia ink, colloidal carbon, Nannochloropsis and shrimp mariculture effluent) at various concentrations to evaluate their potential as possible biofiltration organisms. Filtration rate was measured at eight salinity levels (2 to 35 ppt). The highest individual mussel filtration rate (IMFR) was between 20 and 25 ppt. Filtration was measured at seven temperature levels (5 to 34 ?C). IMFR was highest at 20 ?C. Filtration was measured at nine dissolved oxygen levels (1 to 9 mg/l). IMFR was highest at 3 mg/l but much lower at concentrations between 4 and 9 mg/l. IMFR in colloidal carbon (Aquadag[TM]) was highest at 125 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) but decreased rapidly at higher concentrations indicating gill saturation and/or possible shell valve closure. Mussels exposed to various concentrations of Sepia ink showed relatively constant IMFR with the highest at 200 NTU. Mussels in Nannochloropsis suspensions showed highest IMFR at 125 NTU, similar to Aquadag[TM] experiments but gill saturation occurred at concentrations exceeding 200 NTU. Mussels in mariculture effluent decreased turbidity, however, particle settlement due to gravity was high. Salinity tolerances for M. leucophaeata correspond well to temperate mariculture salinities. M. leucophaeata showed strong thermal adaptation capabilities which correspond well to temperate mariculture fluctuations. M. leucophaeata may reduce phytoplankton levels reducing daily D. O. fluctuations. Aquadag[TM] is a good indicator of mussel feeding on microplankton and nannoplankton while Sepia ink is a good indicator of mussel feeding on picoplankton. Nannochloropsis is a good indicator of mussel feeding on nannoplankton between 1 to 3 []m.

40|$|The study {{reported}} here was aimed at optimising the microfiltration (MF) membrane process applied to water reclamation. Polypropylene hollow fibre membrane (0. 2 &# 956;m) with high pressure backwahing was mainly used in this study. To obtain secondary effluent for microfiltration a biological treatment (UASB/SBR) was applied to brewery effluent. It was identified that loading at a rate below 14 kg COD/kLd will ensure the stable performance of UASB. An initial energy balance of the system (Biological and MF) shows a plant treating brewery effluent (4000 mg/L COD) could yield a net energy of 2. 5 kWh/kL (yield from methane less the plant operating energy) at an optimised MF flux. For the MF of low solids feed {{it was found that}} crossflow has no benefit and that intermittent dead end filtration is less productive than dead-end cycles. It was also that found cycle time between air backwashes is strongly dependent on the imposed flux and the maximum TMP allowed. Analysis based on energy and capital cost indicates that if energy saving is the objective the unit needs to be operated at low imposed flux. However, if capital and energy costs are combined, cost efficient operation would be at about 60 to 70 L/m 2. h for TMPmax of 20 kPa or above 80 L/m 2. h for TMPmax of 50 kPa. For cycles with a TMPmax of 20 kPa, the specific cake resistance was constant over the range of imposed fluxes. However, for a TMPmax of 50 kPa the specific resistance was higher and increased with imposed flux, signifying compressible cake formation. Further analysis of the TMP profiles showed that the membrane resistance increased over a number of cycles and that the increase was higher at higher flux. To fully optimise the operation, it would be necessary to include these factors. Laboratory scale studies with yeast showed many similarities with secondary <b>effluent</b> <b>filtration.</b> However, some inconsistencies were observed at lower f 1 uxes, which need to be confirmed by further studies. Life cycle assessment of the membrane filtration process indicated that operating at low flux (10 Llm 2. h) with higher TMPmax is the environmentally sound operational strategy. The analysis highlights the fact that the environmental impacts mainly come from the membrane operation (more than 85 %). When alternative energy sources are considered, the least impact operational strategy shifts towards higher flux (in the vicinity of 30 l/m 2. h). In-situ electrochemical cleaning using an electrolysis process indicated better flux recovery than traditional chemical cleaning. However, repeated cycles of fouling and cleaning showed electrochemically cleaned membranes have a higher fouling tendency than the chemically cleaned membrane. Initial characterisation of membrane surface properties after cleaning could not provide conclusive evidence for the cause of rapid fouling of the electrochemically cleaned membrane...|$|E

Fifteen oysters of each species weighing 76 - 80 g were stocked {{in each of the}} filtration treatment experimental units (biomass of 1065 – 1174 g oyster per unit). The control treatment was a tank similar to those used in the filtration treatment but with empty oyster shells. Hydraulic retention time of the effluent was of 6 hours in each treatment. First, effluent went through sedimentation, and then the supernatant went through the filtration tanks. Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, turbidity, total suspended solids, total volatile solids, chlorophyll a and BOD 5 were evaluated. During sedimentation and filtration, temperature, pH, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration remained stable. Sedimentation removed 18, 5. 6, 27. 5, 45. 40 and 23. 2 % of turbidity, total suspended solids, total volatile solids, chlorophyll a and BOD 5, respectively. Chlorophyll a and BOD 5 after sedimentation presented significant difference (P< 0. 05) from the farm crude <b>effluent.</b> For the <b>filtration</b> treatment, C. rhizophorae was mor...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{chlorine}} decay {{experiments were}} {{conducted for the}} raw water from Nakdong River that is treated by Chilseo Water Treatment Plant (CWTP) situated in Haman, Korea {{as well as the}} effluents from sand and granular activated carbon (GAC) filters of CWTP and fitted using a chlorine decay model. The model estimated the fast and slow reacting nitrogenous as well as organic/inorganic compounds that were present in the water. It was found that the chlorine demand due to fast and slow reacting (FRA and SRA) organic/inorganic substances was not reduced significantly by sand as well as GAC filters. However, the treated effluents from those filters contained FRA and SRA that are less reactive and had small reaction rate constants. For the effluents from microfiltration, ultrafiltration, and nanofiltration the chlorine demand because FRA and SRA were further reduced but the reaction rate constants were larger compared to those of sand and GAC filter effluents. This has implications in the formation of disinfection by products (DBPs). If DBPs are assumed to form due to the interactions between chlorine and SRA, then {{it is possible that the}} DBP formation potential in the <b>effluents</b> from membrane <b>filtrations</b> could be higher than that in the effluents from granular media filters...|$|R
40|$|Treatment {{of dairy}} <b>effluent</b> by {{membrane}} <b>filtration</b> permits to recover both reusable water and nutrients, but its advantages are weakened by concentration polarization and subsequent membrane fouling as they cause flux decline and permeate quality deterioration. In order to control flux decline, model dairy effluent was treated by shear-enhanced membrane filtration in this study, {{and the role}} of foulants was analyzed. For ultrafiltration (UF) of dairy effluent, protein adsorption and deposition caused flux decline and hydrophilic modification of membranes can reduced this fouling. While for nanofiltration (NF), flux decline was mitigated by the presence of casein micelles, and when the caseins were removed by UF pretreatment, whey proteins would agglomerate through calcium bridges, resulting in severe flux decline during NF concentration. Even if most of proteins were retained by UF pretreatment, free calcium ions increased due to the absence of casein micelles, also inducing flux decline at high concentration factor. Thus, the two-step UF/NF process was not found advantageous as it did not improve the average permeate flux nor permeate quality, while increasing significantly the process energy consumption. This conclusion was valid not only for rotating disk module (RDM) but also for vibratory shear-enhanced process (VSEP), which is available in large membrane area with a low energy consumption.

30|$|Pascal Wunderlin (VSA, Switzerland) {{described}} a testing framework {{to investigate the}} suitability of ozonation {{for the removal of}} micropollutants from wastewater. The tests determine the most effective ozone treatment for a water sample and measure the formation of potentially hazardous oxidation by-products such as bromate and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). These tests are to be complemented by a suite of biological effect assays. Rebekka Teichler (Eawag, Switzerland) presented the results of a study performed at the first full-scale ozonation plant in Switzerland, WWTP Neugut. It was focused on the formation of transformation products (TP) and their reduction by different types of post-treatment systems [conventional filters, biofilm system, and (biologically) activated carbon]. While concentrations of some TP were little reduced, NDMA underwent significant biological degradation. Cornelia Kienle (Ecotox Centre Eawag-EPFL, Switzerland) used ecotoxicological bioassays to measure the efficiency of post-treatment systems at WWTP Neugut. She showed that all combinations of ozonation plus post-treatment systems significantly reduced the biological effects of effluents. Katharina Peschke (University of Tübingen, Germany) presented the results of a study in Baden-Württemberg on advanced wastewater treatment with powdered activated carbon (PAC) and its contribution to ecosystem health in receiving waters. She found positive impacts of advanced wastewater treatment on fish. Similarly, Sabrina Giebner (Goethe University Frankfurt/Main, Germany) studied the effectiveness of treatment combinations, including ozonation and PAC, to reduce a wide range of ecotoxicological effects. In her study, advanced technologies decreased estrogenic activity, but not anti-estrogenic activity of the WWTP <b>effluent.</b> Sand <b>filtration</b> reduced mutagenicity (which was increased after ozonation) confirming the importance of a biological filter system as ozonation post-treatment. Jan Svojitka (University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland, Muttenz) investigated the process combination, PAC, and membrane <b>filtration,</b> for <b>effluent</b> treatment with respect to the removal of micropollutants, biological effects as well as membrane performance. The results confirm an efficient removal of micropollutants for this compact process. Finally, Dennis Becker (Goethe University Frankfurt/Main, Germany) reported results from the European ENDETECH project on enzymatic degradation of antibiotics in water and wastewater samples using a fungal laccase. While antibiotics were successfully removed by the process, antibiotic activity could not be reduced significantly.|$|R
40|$|Intermittent sand {{filtration}} was evaluated {{as a means}} of upgrading the quality of aerated lagoon effluents to satisfy the requirements of PL 92 - 500. The aerated lagoon in question treats the wastes from a milk and cheese factory located in northern Utah. The treatment system consists of two diffused air aeration ponds followed by a facultative settling pond, were applied to pilot scale intermittent sand filters with 0. 17 mm and 0. 40 mm effective size sands. The filters were loaded hydraulically from 0. 25 million gallons per acre per day to 1. 0 million gallons per acre per day. It was found that sand size has a profound effect on the quality of <b>effluent</b> produced by <b>filtration.</b> Also, sand size was related to the time of operation before plugging occurred. At the levels of application studied, hydraulic loading rate was found to affect BOD removal regardless of influent concentration. However, effluent suspended and volatile suspended solids concentrations reflected changes in influent concentrations regardless of hydraulic loading rate. It was found that filtration of facultative settling pond effluent provided better removals than direct filtration of aerated lagoon effluent using equivalent sand sixes and hydraulic loading rates. It was concluded that intermittent {{sand filtration}} was capable of upgrading the effluent from aerated lagoons to meet present and future discharge requirements when effluent from the facultative settling pond was applied to 0. 17 mm effective size sand...|$|R
40|$|This work {{highlights}} {{the recovery of}} water from sewage effluents using alumina ceramic membranes with pore sizes of 0. 2 and 0. 45 μ m respectively in dead-end filtration mode. The work demonstrates the ability and advantages of alumina-based microfiltration (MF) membranes in filtering microbes and other harmful pollutants normally present in sewage <b>effluents</b> in dead-end <b>filtration</b> mode. The fouling behavior of the membranes in the filtration cycle is identified, which in turn helped to regenerate the fouled membranes for subsequent usage. Regeneration studies of fouled membranes also suggest that though chemical cleaning was effective in recovering membrane performance, the fouling had still been progressed slowly and the membranes showed the ability to perform at least five filtration cycles of highly-contaminated sewage effluents. As expected, the filtration efficiency and flux characteristics at various transmembrane pressure (TMP) of the membranes varies with the pore size of the membrane and is explained in light of Darcy's and Poiseuille's laws of filtration. The results show that alumina ceramic membrane with disc geometry having a pore size of 0. 2 μ m is more effective in filtering the total suspended solids, turbidity and microbes of the sewage effluents as compare to that of 0. 45 μ m membrane to a level in which the permeate water appears to be benign for discharging into the surface thereby offering the possibility of recycling or reusing the recovered water from the sewage effluents for suitable purposes...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{fertilizers}} are {{the sources}} of many human-pathogenic microorganisms which potentially threaten the human health. This study was carried out to explore the possible effects of soil and manure types on filtration, transport and fate of manure-borne bacteria through undisturbed soil columns. The manure treatments consisted of cow manure, poultry manure and sewage sludge which were distributed {{at the rate of}} 10 Mg ha- 1 on the surfaces of intact columns of two sandy clay loam and loamy sand soils. The manure-treated soil columns were leached by tap water with similar unsaturated flux of 4. 8 cm h- 1 up to four pore volumes (PV). The influent and leachate were sampled at different PVs. Gram-negative bacteria concentrations were determined for the influent and the columns’ leachate. Average influent concentration, average <b>effluent</b> concentration, relative <b>filtration,</b> and transported bacteria fraction during the leaching events were determined. Significant differences (P&lt; 0. 05) were observed between the poultry manure and the other two manures in terms of average influent (i. e. manure-released) bacteria concentration. Stable structure and preferential pathways facilitated the bacteria movement in the sandy clay loam soil columns. The loamy sand soil strained 1. 45 times more bacteria than the sandy clay loam soil due to its weak structure and blocked-dead pores. Relative contamination of the effluent was higher for poultry manure when compared with the other fertilizers. The low ionic strength of sewage sludge suspension caused the lower filtration of bacteria through the soil columns. The high concentration of soluble organics in cow manure resulted in a relative transport of the bacteria 1. 12 times greater than the poultry manure. In general, management of organic fertilizers especially household poultry manure, as a considerable source of pathogenic bacteria, is important to control the environmental risks of pathogenic pollutions. Moreover, the soil texture and structure significantly affected the fate of manure-borne bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Endocrine disrupting agents {{encompass}} a {{vast array}} of compounds that have multiple biological targets and degrade water quality, especially if this water is to be re-used for groundwater recharge or agricultural practices. Antiestrogenic and estrogenic activities and chemicals have been observed in effluents from full secondary treatment. Assuming that estrogens and antiestrogens are present in wastewater effluent, the overall aim {{of this study is to}} assess the efficiency of treatment processes for the removal of these compounds in one of the major water reclamation producers in the western United States: the Orange County Water District. Utilizing an in vivo bioassay developed in the PI’s laboratory effluents were evaluated after various water treatment processes for the occurrence of estrogenic and antiestrogenic compounds. Treatment processes included reverse osmosis, filtration/chlorination of secondary <b>effluent,</b> ground water <b>filtration,</b> and wetland treatment. In vivo estrogenic activity was observed in fish exposed to effluent treated with filtration/chlorination (which is subsequently used for non-potable purposes), ground water and constructed wetlands. No activity was observed in reconstituted water that had been treated with reverse osmosis. Our results also suggest that in vitro assays based solely on estrogen receptor ligand activity (YES) may underestimate estrogenic activity of sampled water. Although not as robust a measurement as estrogenic activity, in vivo antiestrogenic activity was observed in fish exposed to wastewater samples treated with filtration/chlorination and the wetland. Moreover, wastewater after the wetland treatment seemed to have more antiestrogenic activity than before the treatment. These data indicated the occurrence of antiestrogenic and estrogenic compounds in water following various treatment processes. It is recommended that source identification be considered in future studies utilizing chromatographic fractionation methods to better understand the potential risk associated with these compounds in reclaimed water...|$|R
40|$|As {{energy costs}} rise, water {{reclamation}} facilities (WRFs) desire lower cost, easily operated systems to remove BOD 5 and suspended solids. WRFs typically utilize an aerobic process called activated sludge to remove {{biochemical oxygen demand}} (BOD). BOD, specifically 5 day BOD (BOD 5), is used {{as an indicator of}} the organic strength of a solution. Anaerobic treatment provides an alternative to activated sludge by removing BOD 5, generating biogas containing methane for energy and producing less biomass that requires disposal. Anaerobic treatment functions as an exceptional alternative to activated sludge when packaged as a system with a small footprint that operates at ambient temperature. These systems can produce effluent with organic constituent quality similar to activated sludge without requiring the energy inputs that conventional treatment demands. In this work, an anaerobic, fluidized bed reactor (FBR) treating both synthetic and real domestic primary effluent was utilized to remove BOD¬ 5 from wastewater. The reactor was operated at 10 °C to determine operation under challenging, low-temperature conditions. An external, cross-flow tubular membrane, gravity settling, enhanced chemical coagulation, electrocoagulation and FBR treatment with no subsequent solids removal were all tested in an effort to increase effluent quality, targeting a final BOD 5 of 10 mg/L or less. FBR treatment with no subsequent solids removal with an hydraulic residence time of 9 hours reduced BOD 5 by 68 %, from 199 ± 26 mg/L to 67 ± 15 mg/L (n= 8). Clarification of anaerobic <b>effluent</b> by membrane <b>filtration</b> resulted in an average permeate BOD 5 of 7 ± 4 mg/L. Gravity settling alone achieved an average BOD 5 of 35 ± 5 mg/L (n= 2). Chemical coagulation with 30 mg/L ferric chloride followed by gravity settling reduced the BOD 5 to 14 ± 5 mg/L (n= 8). In comparison, full scale activated sludge with secondary settling achieved a final BOD 5 of 9 ± 2 mg/L (n= 9). Anaerobic treatment with enhanced sedimentation may lend itself to retrofitting existing plants by use of activated sludge tanks and existing secondary clarifiers, whereas membrane filtration requires large capital investment. Additionally, enhanced sedimentation is a robust and relatively simple process in comparison to membrane filter operation. Enhanced sedimentation is a viable option for clarification of anaerobic effluent from an anaerobic FBR treating primary effluent...|$|R
40|$|Biological water {{treatment}} {{has the potential}} to be a readily available, robust, effective and low energy intensity treatment technology. This report investigates the application of biological treatment processes for the removal of remaining organic compounds from a domestic waste{{water treatment}} plant effluent. Biologically activated carbon (BAC) was found to be the preferred media for biological filtration, with removal of dissolved organic compounds by activated carbon being more than three times higher than in comparable sand filters. A two-stage sand-BAC filter was effective in achieving high DOC removal and had advantages during filter cleaning, as well as being compatible with the preferred configuration of the large slow rate filters required for high DOC removal. Methods for enhancing the filtration process were investigated. Pretreatment with alum coagulation and Dissolved Air Flotation/Filtration removed up to 40 % of DOC and achieved excellent solids removal, leading to stable biological activity in BAC filters over long periods with surface skimming as the only maintenance and without the need for backwashing. Ozonation increased the DOC removal by BAC filtration. The DOC removal by BAC at low flow rates without ozonation exceeded that for ozone/BAC treatment at typical (higher) flow rates, meaning that the use of ozone may not be necessary to significantly reduce DOC in all cases. In the absence of ozonation, aeration was essential to achieve high DOC removal as the oxygen consumption in the filters was very high. It was found that longer contact times than are typically used for BAC filtration are required for high DOC removal, although the contact time is dependent on the level of pretreatment. Longer treatment time implies larger filter sizes, and a bigger footprint for the treatment plant. This increase in size and cost can be offset by the fact that equipment for ozone treatment may not be required. Coagulation/filtration removed 40 % of DOC from secondary treated <b>effluent,</b> BAC <b>filtration</b> removed a further 22 % with an EBCT of 140 ± 30 minutes to give a total DOC reduction of 62 %. Ozone/BAC treatment was able to achieve a 30 % reduction (relative to influent) of the DOC remaining after coagulation/ filtration at an EBCT of 140 ± 30 minutes to give a total DOC reduction of 70 %. The effectiveness of biological treatment on the different components of the DOC was also explored. Very hydrophobic and slightly hydrophobic acids combined made up about 80 % of the identified DOC fractions in the feed water, and also after alum pretreatment. BAC filters were able to remove 40 % of this fraction, while ozone/BAC treatment removed over 50 %. There was some variability in the effectiveness of BAC (with or without ozone) for removing hydrophilic compounds. It was also found that BAC, with or without ozone, was able to remove a wide range of pharmaceutical compounds and other micropollutants to below detection limits, with the two exceptions of caffeine and the pharmaceutical gabapentin, which were more than 90 % removed in both treatment trains. The toxicity of the BAC treated water (again with or without ozone pretreatment) was significantly lower than that of the feedstock, and was comparable with that of pure water used as blank control. As measured by IC 50, the toxicity was reduced to approximately 30 % of that of the feed water. The estrogenic effect after treatment, with or without ozone, was below the detection limit. Slow flow BAC treatment appears to be an extremely effective means of removing micropollutants from water, even without the ozone pretreatment. The use of the UV Excitation Emission Matrix (EEM) technique as a rapid method for evaluating DOC removal was explored. It proved to be a useful analytical tool, able to distinguish the proportion of the different fractions such as neutral hydrophilic compounds, charged hydrophilic compounds and hydrophobic compounds (in combination with resin treatments) as well as the total residual DOC after treatment...|$|R
