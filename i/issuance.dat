3000|$|... 1. Low Capital is a dummy {{variable}} {{that takes the}} value of one if the bank has a Basel capital ratio below 10 % and zero otherwise. Banks closer to the regulatory limit {{are less likely to}} finance their growth based only on debt <b>issuances</b> compared with banks with a capital buffer over the minimum because this financing would deteriorate their capital ratio even more. In this case, we expect that the coefficient of this variable will be negative for the <b>issuances</b> of debt and/or positive for the <b>issuances</b> of instruments considered regulatory capital. If the pecking order holds, we should observe a positive and statistically significant sign only in hybrid <b>issuances,</b> whereas the statistical significance of both hybrid and capital instruments would support the trade-off theory.|$|R

30|$|Besides {{the effect}} on the pure {{decision}} of issuing versus not issuing, we analyze which instruments banks choose to respond to liquidity needs. If the decision on the instrument follows the pecking order, banks would only issue debt instruments to minimize the cost of asymmetric information and, therefore, the liquidity and growth variables would only be significant for debt <b>issuances.</b> If the decision on the instruments follows the trade-off theory, we should observe significant coefficients in all financial instruments because the banks have to combine the <b>issuances</b> of all types of financial instruments to maintain the same proportion of each component. This result could be consistent with the fulfillment of capital regulation, if banks issue both hybrid and capital instruments to keep their regulatory capital levels constant. Nonetheless, if the <b>issuances</b> of eligible capital instruments are meant to fulfill capital regulation at the lowest possible cost, we could observe <b>issuances</b> of debt and hybrid instruments only, but not capital instruments.|$|R

Besides noting that these international capital raisings grew almost four-fold from 1991 to 2005, accounting for 35 percent of all capital raised through security <b>issuances,</b> the paper has three main findings. First, a large and growing fraction of capital raisings, especially debt <b>issuances,</b> occurs in international markets, but {{a very small number}} of firms accounts for the bulk of international capital raisings, highlighting the distributional implications of financial globalization. Second, changes in firm performance following equity and debt <b>issuances</b> in international markets are qualitatively similar to those following domestic <b>issuances,</b> suggesting that capital raisings abroad are not intrinsically different from domestic ones. Third, after firms start accessing international markets, they significantly increase the amount raised in domestic markets, suggesting that international and domestic markets are complements.
