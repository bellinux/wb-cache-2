25|$|Cúirt An Mheán Oíche (The Midnight Court) by Brian Merriman (17471805) <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oddity in 18th-century Irish {{poetry in}} Irish. Merriman {{was a teacher}} of {{mathematics}} who {{lived and worked in}} the Munster counties of Clare and Limerick. Cúirt An Mheán Oíche, effectively his only poetic work, was written around 1780. The poem begins by using the conventions of the Aisling, or vision poem, in which the poet is out walking when he has a vision of a woman from the other world. Typically, this woman is Ireland and the poem will lament her lot and/or call on her 'sons' to rebel against foreign tyranny.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} by the intimacy of sleeper carriages, in which people aim to sleep in close proximity to strangers. [...] "La Couchette" [...] draws upon the literary tropes associated with stories, such as Murder on the Orient Express and Strangers on a Train, following characters unknown to one another while travelling. The various characters—played by actors somewhat typecast—correspond to British comedy archetypes, and much of the episode's story and humour derives from the characters' unlikability. Critics responded positively to [...] "La Couchette", commending the cast and script, but noted that Inside No. 9 <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acquired taste. On its first showing, the episode was watched by 1.1 million viewers (6.1% of the audience).|$|E

He noted, though, that [...] "even if they don’t make you laugh, you have to concede this duo are the most febrilely inventive writers on TV." [...] Wollaston, who reviewed the episode for The Guardian, observed that humour generally is extremely personal, and said that he [...] "never really got Shearsmith and Pemberton's stuff". He said he could appreciate the narrative and artistry of [...] "La Couchette", and could understand why others found it funny, but that he does not love Inside No. 9, and that, when watching, he is [...] "just not laughing". A viewer unimpressed with the episode wrote to The Times. Disagreeing with Billen's review, the reader claimed that the episode's [...] "puerile humour [...] flatulent as its one-dimensional figures".|$|E

Walter Chaw of Film Freak Central praised the film for its pacing and action sequences, describing them as [...] "kinetic, fair, and intelligent, every payoff packaged with a moment's contemplation crucial to the creation of tension" [...] and that the movie could be understood as a clever subversion of the genre. Charles Taylor of Salon.com acclaimed the film as [...] "entertaining, handsome and gripping, The Bourne Identity <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> anomaly among big-budget summer blockbusters: a thriller with some brains and feeling behind it, more attuned to story and character than to spectacle" [...] and praised Liman for giving the film a [...] "tough mindedness" [...] that never gives way into [...] "cynicism or hopelessness".|$|E

Thankfully, for the sake of herself, her fans and mankind in general, Madge had a bit of re-think. [...] GHV2 contains some of the best pop music made by anybody", although he criticized the omission of some singles like [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] or [...] "Rain". Cristine Leach from Raidió Teilifís Éireann gave the compilation 4 out of 5 stars, saying that [...] " [...] is still the queen of pop and GHV2 is essential listening.

[...] Dugald Baird from Music Week noted: [...] "the set <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> anti-climax, although it is an essential purchase for her army of fans".|$|E

He also presents his thesis {{that there is a}} difference between masculinity and patriarchy. The author also argues that there is a deep need within men to participate in a fraternity with men and to have their maleness recognized by other men, but that our society often does not take this into account. The author claims that what usually results is that these needs become frustrated and manifest themselves in often anti-social behavior and activities, such as hazing rituals.|$|E

2500|$|The overall {{success of}} Beauty and the Beast is {{partially}} {{attributed to the}} song's popularity. Andrew Unterberger of Spin believes that the song [...] "set the template for the quivering love theme in ’90s Disney movies". [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] was the first Disney song to undergo a complete pop rearrangement for commercial purposes. After the success of Disney's The Little Mermaid revived the Disney musical in 1989, [...] Gary Trust of Billboard determined that [...] "Once Beauty and the Beast followed in 1991 ... Disney was dominating charts like never before". The single ended a thirty year-long absence of Disney-released chart hits between the 1960s and 1990s, and inspired several similar hits; popular recording artists such as Elton John, Vanessa Williams, Michael Bolton, Christina Aguilera, and Phil Collins each experienced {{varying degrees of success}} with their own pop renditions of Disney songs throughout the decade. When a then-unknown Aguilera was selected to record a pop version of [...] "Reflection" [...] from Disney's Mulan in 1998, she felt honored [...] "to be in such wonderful company as" [...] Dion. Writing for Sputnikmusic, Irving Tan wrote that [...] "Although the number's 1992 Academy Award for Best Original Song <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old chestnut at this point, it still bears some worth repeating - mainly as it is very likely the most famous of all the feature theme songs ever commissioned by Walt Disney Studios." ...|$|E
2500|$|Patrolmen Joseph McMannamon and Chester Szukalski {{were among}} the first uniformed {{officers}} to arrive at Beulah Avenue, approaching from the south on E. 123rd Street. The time of their arrival has been estimated as 8:30 PM. As they pulled in front of the tow truck, gunfire struck their vehicle from the south. As the men tried to escape out the driver's side door, Szukalski was hit. Severely injured, he crawled about [...] toward a home and waited for help. McMannamon was lightly injured by bullet fragments. As more marked police cars arrived, the gunmen ran east—moving across Lakeview Road into a narrow alley that <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extension of Beulah Avenue. As the gunment fled, they exchanged gunfire with other police who had just arrived, then turned south down the alley to get behind 1395 Lakeview Road. Sources differ as to what happened next. Cleveland police claim the gunmen burst into the house, and occupied the second floor. Mrs. Beatrice Flagg and her children, living in the apartment on the first floor, fell to the ground to avoid being hit when police fired into the building. As the police pumped tear gas canisters into the home, the family fled. The police also claimed that the gunmen surprised Rev. Henry L. Perryman's wife, who fled with their nine-month-old son as the armed men seized her second-floor apartment. The police then occupied the first floor of 1391 Lakeview Road {{to use it as a}} base from which they could fire at the gunment at 1395 Lakeview. But Mrs. Perryman denied that any gunmen burst in on her. She and Mrs. Flagg claimed they received no warning before police began firing guns at their homes and launching tear gas through the windows. A later press report gave a third version of events, saying the police ordered the apartments evacuated. After the Flaggs and Perrymans fled, the gunmen burst into the building and occupied the second floor.|$|E
