25|$|The blended gases at {{the intake}} to the {{compressor}} {{will be at}} a pressure slightly below ambient, due to losses in the blending tube. This may make it impracticable to use some types of analysis instruments, which rely on a flow of gas through the instrument driven by {{the pressure of the}} measured gas. Oxygen cells are also sensitive to a pressure drop, as they directly measure partial pressure, and this may lead to a mix richer than intended, as the oxygen flow may be set to the partial pressure appropriate for atmospheric pressure, while the measured mixture is at a lower pressure. This can be compensated by using a small sampling pump drawing gas from the blending tupe and delivering it to the instruments, or by allowing for the reduced <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure</b> for oxygen analysis with an in-line sensor cell. This would require a vacuum gauge measuring the pressure drop or abbsolute pressure at the sensor. Partial pressure of oxygen must be correct as a fraction of absolute pressure at the point of measurement.|$|E
5000|$|For {{air flow}} at room temperature, when the outlet {{pressure}} {{is less than}} 1/2 the absolute <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure,</b> the flow becomes quite simple (although it reaches sonic velocity internally). With Cv = 1.0 and 200 psia <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure</b> the flow is 100 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm). The flow {{is proportional to the}} absolute <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure</b> so that the flow in scfm would equal the Cv flow coefficient if the <b>inlet</b> <b>pressure</b> were reduced to 2 psia and the outlet were connected to a vacuum with less than 1 psi absolute pressure (1.0 scfm when Cv = 1.0, 2 psia input).|$|E

Depending on the oil and water <b>inlet</b> <b>pressures</b> three different operating conditions were identified that shift upon applying a voltage: stable oil–water interface, drop generation, and laminar water jet formation. Full control over the drop generation is achieved within a well-defined range of <b>inlet</b> <b>pressures,</b> in quantitative agreement with a model based on the additive contributions from electrowetting and the local hydrostatic pressure at the junction. The tuning power of electrowetting is shown to increase upon device miniaturization, which makes this approach particularly attractive for flow control on the sub-micrometer scale...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the 19 XB- 2 A gas turbine is being conducted at the Cleveland laboratory {{to determine the effect}} on turbine performance of various <b>inlet</b> <b>pressures,</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures, <b>pressure</b> ratios, and wheel speeds.

At these conditions the total-pressure ratio is 2. 08 across the turbine and the turbine inlet total temperature is 2000 degrees R. Runs have been made with turbine <b>inlet</b> total <b>pressures</b> of 20, 30, 40, and 45 inches of mercury absolute for a constant total pressure ratio across the turbine of 2. 40, the maximum value that could be obtained. Additional runs have been made with total pressure ratios of 1. 50 and 2. 00 at an <b>inlet</b> total <b>pressure</b> of 45 inches of mercury absolute. All runs were made with an inlet total temperature of 800 degrees R over a range of corrected turbine wheel speeds from 40 to 150 percent of the corrected speed at the design point.

40|$|Lean Direct Injection (LDI) is a {{combustor}} {{concept that}} reduces nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. This paper {{looks at a}} 3 -zone multipoint LDI concept developed by Parker Hannifin Corporation. The concept was tested in a flame-tube test facility at NASA Glenn Research Center. Due to test facility limitations, such as inlet air temperature and pressure, the flame-tube test {{was not able to}} cover the full set of engine operation conditions. Three NOx correlation equations were developed based on assessing NOx emissions dependencies on <b>inlet</b> air <b>pressure</b> (P 3), <b>inlet</b> air temperature (T 3), and fuel air equivalence ratio () to estimate the NOx emissions at the unreachable high engine power conditions. As the results, the NOx emissions are found to be a strong function of combustion inlet air temperature and fuel air equivalence ratio but a weaker function of <b>inlet</b> air <b>pressure.</b> With these three equations, the NOx emissions performance of this injector concept is calculated as a 66 % reduction relative to the ICAO CAEP- 6 standard using a 55 : 1 pressure-ratio engine cycle. Uncertainty in the NOx emissions estimation increases as the extrapolation range departs from the experimental conditions. Since maximum <b>inlet</b> air <b>pressure</b> tested was less than 50 % of the full power engine <b>inlet</b> air <b>pressure,</b> a future experiment at higher <b>inlet</b> air <b>pressure</b> conditions is needed to confirm the NOx emissions dependency on <b>inlet</b> air <b>pressure...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of two air-abrasive prophylaxis systems and the effect of <b>inlet</b> air <b>pressure</b> on the surface of BrÅnemark titanium abutment cylinders. Materials and Methods : Single abutment cylinders were treated with either the Prophy-Jet system (sodium bicarbonate abrasive) (Dentsply International, York, PA) or the Microprophy system (aluminum oxide abrasive) (Danville Engineering Co, Danville, CA) for 60 seconds at an <b>inlet</b> air <b>pressure</b> of 60 psi or 90 psi. The effects on the surface of each abutment cylinder were visually inspected by scanning electron microscopy. Results : A comparison of abutment cylinder surfaces after treatment showed that the Prophy Jet system removed machining marks to a greater degree than the Microprophy system. Sodium bicarbonate particles from the Prophy-Jet system were significantly larger than the aluminum oxide particles used with the Microprophy system, potentially accounting for the difference in abrasivity. In addition, <b>inlet</b> air <b>pressure</b> of 60 psi caused removal of machining marks to a greater degree than an <b>inlet</b> air <b>pressure</b> of 90 psi. The principle of phase separation may account for the lower <b>inlet</b> air <b>pressure</b> causing more removal of machining marks than the higher <b>inlet</b> air <b>pressure.</b> Conclusions : Under the experimental conditions tested, neither of the two systems tested seemed to cause significant abrasion of the surface of titanium abutment cylinders...|$|R

The key to predicting future output curves as a function of wellhead pressure was predicting two-phase well productivities as a function of field pressure and enthalpy trends. Using a wellbore simulator to generate inflow pressure curves from output test data and matching measured downhole data showed that the Duns and Ros flow correlation produced a linear response with a consistent relationship to static pressures for most wells.
