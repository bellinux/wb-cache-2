50|$|Owing to {{the small}} height {{available}} with this pre-fabricated foundation, the semi-portable engine had no large flywheel, as was standard practice for stationary engines. The need for a more even power delivery, without the smoothing effect of a flywheel, encouraged the use of twin cylinder engines, even though a larger single cylinder would be cheaper and equally powerful. Where a flywheel was supplied, this was smaller than usual and would still require a pit digging in which to site it. During factory testing, the <b>engine</b> <b>bed</b> {{would have to be}} raised on timber baulks to provide this extra height.|$|E
50|$|Whizz Whizz Bang Bang is a BAFTA Scotland {{nominated}} Best Children's Programme on BBC {{television series}} that began airing the fifth of March, 2007. A licensed television format {{based on the}} New Zealand series Let's Get Inventin'. Presented by Greg Foot. It features a different child in each programme who has an invention idea and then the team, {{with the help of}} Ralph, tries to build it. Most attempts have been successful, although all ideas have had to be slightly changed to make them practical. Inventions have included a hover scooter, a hydraulic off road wheel chair, basketball launcher, jet <b>engine</b> <b>bed</b> and an Air Guitar.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{development}} of the horizontal stationary engine in the mid 19th century, the requirements were no longer to support a single heavy beam but now to provide accurate alignment between the cylinders and crankshaft of a medium-speed engine. These foundations were substantial, going down perhaps three-dozen courses of brickwork below the <b>engine</b> <b>bed.</b> Deep iron anchors were provided within the brickwork for the engine to be bolted down. Rough local stone was no longer rigid enough and so foundations were constructed of many layers of hard engineering brick, as this was cheaper and more easily available than a cut ashlar stone of equal rigidity. As these engine ran at faster speeds than the beam engines, their vibration could also be higher requiring a foundation that could withstand such. Alignment between slideways and crankshaft depended upon the original care with which the foundation had been built.|$|E
50|$|A {{new company}} {{was formed in}} 1912 and the mine reopened after many years. A Victorian mine manager, David Morgan, was {{appointed}} as the new Tyrconnel mine manager. By early 1913 they had the winding gear and ore bins erected. The owners bought the Great Dyke Company's ten head battery at Caledonia Creek near Thornborough. T. Harley, engineer-in-charge, had the contract for £80 to transport the battery to its new position. Their first twelve weeks of crushings from the mine were impressive yielding 1,041 ounces of gold from 945 tons of stone (sent out to another battery for crushing). They installed a compressor in July 1913 and rock drills in September. In October they struck a reef almost 2.4 m wide which offered two to three ounce gold quartz. The mine shaft was then put in order in November for skips. By then the battery was almost ready and the headframe was being put in position. They also had a suction gas engine sitting at Dimbulah awaiting transport to the Hodgkinson. The battery started crushing in February 1914 but broke down in May because the <b>engine</b> <b>bed</b> plate broke. The company was doing very well through Morgan's careful management and William Keating's confidence. They were obtaining one ounce stone continually in 1914 and the battery kept going {{as long as there}} was water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{studies the}} {{fundamental}} features {{and the control}} mechanism of input mobilities of a complex ship structure by utilizing the well-established finite element analysis method. It is shown that the input mobility of a ship structure due to out-of-plane force and bending moment excitations at the engine mount locations {{is controlled by the}} bending stiffness of engine supports. The frequency averaged input mobility can be represented by that of the corresponding infinite beam. The input mobility due to an in-plane force excitation is bounded by those of the corresponding finite and infinite beams. The torsional moment input mobility can be predicted by the input mobility of the source <b>engine</b> <b>bed</b> section bounded by two consecutive ring frames attributed to the comparatively large in-plane stiffness of the ring frames. It is illustrated that the frequency averaged ship structural response is almost unaffected by neglecting the ship hull and deck plates in the analysis...|$|E
