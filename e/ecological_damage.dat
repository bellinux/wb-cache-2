5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts {{are one of}} the most common marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike. Their aggregational effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns on the negative impact of fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of <b>ecological</b> <b>damage</b> is done by bottom trawling, which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>damages</b> {{have to be}} {{evaluated}} in monetary terms for implementation in an economic analysis. Economic theory is based upon individual preferences (methodological individualism) : <b>Ecological</b> <b>damages</b> can only be socially evaluated when individual values are available. However, {{in sharp contrast to}} marketable goods and services, <b>ecological</b> <b>damages</b> generally are pure public goods and, thus, market prices as a lower value bound do not exist. Therefore, we have to use alternative evaluation methods to get economic values of <b>ecological</b> <b>damages.</b> In this paper, we concentrate on four main points of the evaluation of <b>ecological</b> <b>damages</b> in economic models: Firstly, we show the general economic approach to obtain values of non goods and services on a micro economic level. Afterwards, we discuss the assumptions and shortcomings of the economic approach. Thirdly, we determine optimal social environmental levels from a macro which is followed by an analysis of the applicability of this approach. Some summarizing remarks close the paper...|$|R

An attempt to tow the bow section of the ship out to sea failed when the tow line broke, and the bow was grounded again. Eventually, the bow was successfully towed out to sea and sunk. The stern section remained on the beach near Coos Bay.

5|$|The Soviet period saw a rapid {{increase}} of the population, although most of it remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads. The Sami people were subject to forced collectivization, including forced relocation to Lovozero and other centralized settlements, and overall the peninsula was heavily industrialized and militarized, largely due to its strategic position and {{the discovery of the}} vast apatite deposits in the 1920s. As a result, the ecology of the peninsula suffered major <b>ecological</b> <b>damage,</b> including contamination by military nuclear waste and nickel smelting.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is {{a serious}} threat to {{seamount}} ecological welfare. There are several well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, for example the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the pelagic armorhead (Pseudopentaceros richardsoni) near Japan and Russia. The {{reason for this is that}} the fishes that are targeted over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is confounded by the dangers of trawling, which damages seamount surface communities, and the fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult. Bottom trawling in particular is extremely devastating to seamount ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of <b>ecological</b> <b>damage</b> to seamounts.|$|E

5|$|By 1960, Carson {{had more}} than enough {{research}} material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and <b>ecological</b> <b>damage</b> that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact malignant and the cancer had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing {{was done by the}} fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>damage</b> was {{widespread}} but generally mild. Although damage to mangroves was minor, the cyclone defoliated swaths of many coastal and island forests. For the most part, cays and reefs were unharmed, with no visible {{change in the}} general appearance or shape of reefs and little underwater change as well. It was noted, however, that water clarity surrounding certain reefs was poor. River plumes of the Herbert, Tully, Murray, Hull, Johnstone, and Mulgrave/Russell rivers were noticeably changed, with some paths diverted. The Herbert River plume expanded to encompass areas near the Greater Palm group of islands, the Mulgrave/Russell around the Frankland Islands. In addition, {{the loss of a}} raft system utilized for farming of giant clams was noted near Fitzroy Island. Tourist operations experienced little damage from Winifred, with only minimal damage on Dunk Island, Bedarra Island, and Mission Beach. Overall, Winifred caused three deaths and $130million (1986AUD) in damage, and was described by the Bureau of Meteorology as the worst cyclone to strike Queensland since Cyclone Althea in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The initial premise {{placed the}} story on a space station to avoid the <b>ecological</b> <b>damage</b> that the creatures would have on a planet. However, Gerrold's agent was {{concerned}} that requiring a miniature of the station to be built {{as well as the}} additional sets would cause it to be too expensive for a single episode. Because of his agent's comments, Gerrold modified the pitch to place the action on a colony planet instead. This pitch included the plot points such as the creatures getting into a poisoned grain storage, but omitted the Klingons; and Cyrano Jones was called Cyrano Smith. The five pitches were submitted by Gerrold's agent in February 1967, and received a response in June. At the time the show had already purchased too many scripts for the second season but story editor D. C. Fontana suggested that they should purchase the story and assign it to a staff writer as it was better than some of the other stories they already had.|$|E

5|$|Unusual in many aspects, the 1846Havana {{hurricane}} was {{the most}} intense of its time. Though atmospheric pressure readings in Cuba reached as low as 916mbar (27.06inHg), the meteorological historian Jose Fernandez-Partagás re-evaluated several possible pressure records, concluding that the cyclone's minimum pressure was likely closer to 938mbar (27.70inHg); even so, it maintained the title of having the lowest recorded pressure measurement until 1924, 78years later. Although no reliable wind measurements were available at the time, a separate study also estimated that it produced Category5-strength winds, making it the first known storm to strike Cuba at such an intensity. As {{a result of the}} tropical cyclone's extreme intensity, ecological and geographical features were permanently altered in many areas.
