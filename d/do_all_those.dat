Bianca tells Marissa she did it because Bianca could not <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> things for Marissa herself.

In spite of her husband's protestations, and to his genuine distress, she had to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> things which he had declared should never be required of her". Spender argues that {{the similarities between the}} Brenda of this book and Praed's mother are [...] "impossible to ignore". However, she says that Praed does not endlessly copy her mother, creating instead [...] "realistic characters" [...] through which she generalised about the experience of women in the bush. Many of her heroines, too, confronted the question of whether to marry. In The Bond of Wedlock (1887) she explores violent marriage, and in Nadine: The Study of a Woman (1882) she looks at what a woman can do when she has a child and no husband.|$|E

60|$|I {{have talked}} {{a good deal}} about this to Jone, and he says I'm getting to be a philosopher; but I don't think it takes much philosophizing to find out how this case stands. If house service could be looked upon in the proper way, it wouldn't take long for American girls who have to work for their living to find out that it's a lot better to live with nice people, and cook and wait on the table, and <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> things which come natural to women the world over, than to stand all day behind a counter under the thumb of a floor-walker, or grind their lives out like slaves among a lot of steam-engines and machinery.

60|$|Let us consider. What does it depend upon? It depends {{altogether}} {{upon the}} proposition that the States must, without the interference of the General Government, <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> things that pertain exclusively to themselves,--that are local in their nature, that have no connection with the General Government. After Judge Douglas has established this proposition, which nobody disputes or ever has disputed, he proceeds to assume, without proving it, that slavery is one of those little, unimportant, trivial matters which are of just about as much consequence as the question would be to me whether my neighbor should raise horned cattle or plant tobacco; that there is no moral question about it, but that it is altogether a matter of dollars and cents; that when a new Territory is opened for settlement, the first man who goes into it may plant there a thing which, like the Canada thistle or some other of those pests of the soil, cannot be dug out by the millions of men who will come thereafter; that it is one of those little things that is so trivial in its nature that it has nor effect upon anybody save the few men who first plant upon the soil; {{that it is not a}} thing which in any way affects the family of communities composing these States, nor any way endangers the General Government. Judge Douglas ignores altogether the very well known fact that we have never had a serious menace to our political existence, except it sprang from this thing, which he chooses to regard as only upon a par with onions and potatoes.|$|E

60|$|The real {{attractions of}} the Hollowell farm, to me, were: its {{complete}} retirement, being, {{about two miles}} from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field; its bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark. I was in haste to buy it, before the proprietor finished getting out some rocks, cutting down the hollow apple trees, and grubbing up some young birches which had sprung up in the pasture, or, in short, had made any more of his improvements. To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders--I never heard what compensation he received for that--and <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> things which had no other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I wanted, if I could only afford to let it alone. But it turned out as I have said.|$|E
6000|$|I am in {{some doubt}} whether to {{introduce}} another topic upon which I could talk a while. [Cries of [...] "Go on," [...] and [...] "Give us it."] It is this, then: Douglas's Popular sovereignty, as a principle, is simply this: If one man chooses {{to make a}} slave of another man, neither that man nor anybody else {{has a right to}} object. Apply it to government, as he seeks to apply it, and it is this: If, in a new Territory into which a few people are beginning to enter for the purpose of making their homes, they choose to either exclude slavery from their limits, or to establish it there, however one or the other may affect the persons to be enslaved, or the infinitely greater number of persons who are afterward to inhabit that Territory, or {{the other members of the}} family of communities of which they are but an incipient member, or the general head of the family of States as parent of all, however their action may affect one or the other of these, there is no power or right to interfere. That is Douglas's popular sovereignty applied. Now, I think that there is a real popular sovereignty in the world. I think the definition of popular sovereignty, in the abstract, would be about this: that each man shall do precisely as he pleases with himself, and with all those things which exclusively concern him. Applied in government, this principle would be that a general government shall <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> things which pertain to it, and all the local governments shall do precisely as they please in respect to those matters which exclusively concern them.|$|E
60|$|But as for vain fears, {{leave them}} {{to those who}} will not believe God's message {{concerning}} himself--that he is love, and his mercy over all his works. Leave them for those who deny God's righteousness, by denying {{that he has had}} pity on this poor fallen world, but has left it to itself and its sins, without sending any one to save it. And for real fears, leave them for those who have no fears; for those who think they see, and yet are blind; who think themselves orthodox and infallible, and beyond making a mistake, every man his own Pope; who say that they see, and therefore their sin remaineth; for those who thank God that they are not as other men are, and who will find the publicans and harlots entering into the kingdom of heaven before them; and for those who continue in sin that grace may abound, and call themselves Christians, while they bring shame on the name of Christ by their own evil lives, by their worldliness and profligacy, or by their bitterness and quarrelsomeness; who make religious profession a by-word and a mockery in the mouths of the ungodly, and cause Christ's little ones to stumble. Let them be afraid, if they will; for it were better for them that a millstone were hanged about their neck, and they were drowned {{in the midst of the}} sea. But those who hate their sins, and long to leave their sins behind; those who distrust themselves--let them not be anxious about the morrow; for to-morrow, and to-day, and for ever, the Almighty Father is watching over them, the Lord Jesus guiding them wisely and tenderly, and the Holy Spirit inspiring them more and more to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> good works which God has prepared for them to walk in, and to conquer in the life-long battle against sin, the world, and the devil.|$|E
