5|$|The {{roller coaster}} {{operates}} with seven stadium-style seating X-Car trains. Each train has two cars that can hold six riders each {{for a total}} of twelve riders per train. On the <b>head</b> <b>rest</b> of each seat there are two speakers that play music during the ride. The speakers have been designed so that only the rider's selected music track will be audible. On the restraint is a small touch screen where riders can choose which song they want to listen to during the ride. Additionally, the trains are equipped with multi-coloured lights that can be seen during the night.|$|E
5|$|The coaster's seven trains {{double the}} {{capacity}} of the traditional El Loco ride from 4 seats per train to 8 seats per train. The trains are articulated {{in such a way that}} the first row of four riders moves independently from the second row. Each seat features a pair of stereo speakers in the <b>head</b> <b>rest.</b> These speakers are capable of playing multiple tracks for up to 9 minutes on a single charge. Riders are harnessed to the ride through the use of lap bars. The front of each car features a pulsing LED Green Lantern logo while the back of each car features the Green Lantern oath. All of these operational and thematic characteristics are new for this type of ride and were developed specifically for this coaster.|$|E

40|$|<b>Head</b> <b>rests</b> {{are aimed}} at {{preventing}} injuries to the head and neck, in particular in rear end collisions. They are not mandatory in the Netherlands {{and there are many}} designs for them. The Institute for Road Safety Research SWOV has researched the efficiency of <b>head</b> <b>rests</b> in cars using accident statistics. The prevention of whiplash injury especially is studied. The long term consequences of whiplash injury are considered. It is concluded that rear end collisions are mostly less severe accidents with almost no severe injury. <b>Head</b> <b>rests</b> are useful because they decrease the frequency of neck injury in rear end collisions by 25 %. Recommendations are presented for the use of <b>head</b> <b>rests</b> and for further research...|$|R

The Flat Bed Seat offered a seat measuring up to [...] wide when the adjustable armrest was positioned flush with the seat cushion. Electronic controls enabled customers to easily move the seats to an infinite combination of seat adjustments, including lumbar support, leg and foot rests. iPod connectivity was available in the Flat Bed Seat. The new BusinessFirst seats had a six-way adjustable <b>head</b> <b>rest,</b> an individual overhead reading light and an adjustable seat light allowing customers to read in bed without disturbing their neighbor and a privacy shell that allowed for seclusion from other travelers. BusinessFirst customers also received {{one of the highest}} crew to passenger ratios (1:8) among all international business class products.|$|E
2500|$|For 2004 both coupe and sedans were altered, with updated {{interiors}} {{and improved}} transmissions. The five-speed automatic transmission on the 350GT Premium now included synchro rev control, while the 6-speed manual transmission {{was made to}} vibrate less. For the sedan, the front grill/bumper, foot panel, head lamp, rear bumper, and rear combination lamps were changed. The front seats received active <b>head</b> <b>rest,</b> while the rear middle seat now have a three-point seat belt as standard. There were also some new wheels and a 19-inch option for the coupé. The Skyline's 2005 update again included changes to the head and rear lamps, front bumper, and side sill protectors. Also, 19-inch aluminium alloy wheel became standard for automatic transmission cars. A [...] "plasma cluster ion" [...] full air conditioner with left/right independent temperature settings, heated door mirrors, head lamp auto levelizer (compliant with new legislation) was made standard equipment.|$|E

[...] cried the mother, who had never before seen her darling struck down in this way, and felt something of the alarmed anguish that women, feel {{at the sight of}} overpowering sorrow in a strong man; for this child had been her ruler. Sitting down by her with circling arms, she pressed her cheek against Gwendolen's head, and then tried to draw it upward.

She is gone; and her place knows her no more. Vanish, false Sorceress; into Space! Needless to hover at neighbouring Ruel; for thy day is done. Shut are the royal palace-gates for evermore; hardly in coming years shalt thou, under cloud of night, descend once, in black domino, like a black night-bird, and disturb the fair Antoinette's music-party in the Park: all Birds of Paradise flying from thee, and musical windpipes growing mute. (Campan, i. 197.) Thou unclean, yet unmalignant, not unpitiable thing! What a course was thine: from that first trucklebed (in Joan of Arc's country) where thy mother bore thee, with tears, to an unnamed father: forward, through lowest subterranean depths, and over highest sunlit heights, of Harlotdom and Rascaldom--to the guillotine-axe, which shears away thy vainly whimpering <b>head!</b> <b>Rest</b> there uncursed; only buried and abolished: what else befitted thee? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{burst into}} tears of maudlin pity for himself, and at length {{suffering}} her to embrace him and take charge of him, let his grey <b>head</b> <b>rest</b> against her cheek, and bewailed his wretchedness. Presently he changed {{the subject of his}} lamentations, and clasping his hands about her as she embraced him, cried, O Amy, his motherless, forlorn child! O the days that he had seen her careful and laborious for him! Then he reverted to himself, and weakly told her how much better she would have loved him if she had known him in his vanished character, and how he would have married her to a gentleman who should have been proud of her as his daughter, and how (at which he cried again) she should first have ridden at his fatherly side on her own horse, and how the crowd (by which he meant in effect the people who had given him the twelve shillings he then had in his pocket) should have trudged the dusty roads respectfully.|$|E
60|$|The male {{tendency}} in me was forever strained to solve her, to deduce from her conversation and conduct {{a body of}} consistent law. The effort was useless. Here was a realm, that of Nancy's soul, {{in which there was}} apparently no such thing as relevancy. In the twilight, after dinner, we often walked through the orchard to a grassy bank beside the little stream, where we would sit and watch the dying glow in the sky. After a rain its swollen waters were turbid, opaque yellow-red with the clay of the hills; at other times it ran smoothly, temperately, almost clear between the pasture grasses and wild flowers. Nancy declared that it reminded her of me. We sat there, into the lush, warm nights, and the moon shone down on us, or again through long silences we searched the bewildering, starry chart of the heavens, with the undertones of the night-chorus of the fields in our ears. Sometimes she let my <b>head</b> <b>rest</b> upon her knee; but when, throbbing at her touch, with the life-force pulsing around us, I tried to take her in my arms, to bring her lips to mine, she resisted me with an energy of will and body that I could not overcome, I dared not overcome. She acknowledged her love for me, she permitted me to come to her, she had the air of yielding but never yielded. Why, then, did she allow the words of love to pass? and how draw the line between caresses? I was maddened and disheartened by that elusive resistance in her--apparently so frail a thing!--that neither argument nor importunity could break down. Was there something lacking in me? or was it that I feared to mar or destroy the love she had. This, surely, had not been the fashion of other loves, called unlawful, the classic instances celebrated by the poets of all ages rose to mock me.|$|E
