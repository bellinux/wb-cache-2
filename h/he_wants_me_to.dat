500|$|Holley auditioned {{to become}} a {{featured}} vocalist on the American reality television show Dancing with the Stars. The audition consisted of him performing seven different sounds, ranging from Frank Sinatra to Sly Stone. He was successful and became a featured singer {{during the first three}} seasons of the series. Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not a new experience for him. [...] "I've been at sessions where a producer has said <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time. I've had people say can you make it a little more green. Huh? It's tricky." [...] He added, [...] "Sometimes they think they want Sheryl Crow, because she has a hit single. But what they really want is magic, and that is whatever you, as an individual, can bring. It's a tough call between being a blank slate and being yourself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smith was {{replaced}} as writer/director by Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence, {{in what would}} have been his directorial debut. He had enthused, [...] "Not only can I recite the original Fletch movie line for line, I actually read all the Greg Mcdonald books as a kid. Consider me obsessed— I'm going to try as hard as I can not to screw this up." [...] Lawrence was signed to direct both Fletch Won and a sequel. Scrubs star Zach Braff was rumored to be in talks for the lead role, and in January 2007, Braff posted on his web site that [...] "Bill Lawrence is writing and directing Fletch in the spring and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play young Fletch, but no firm plans are in place yet. He is still writing the script." [...] In April 2007, Braff announced that he had dropped out of the film to work on his own film, Open Hearts. In June 2007, it was announced that Lawrence was off the project and had been replaced by Steve Pink.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 October 2014, it was {{announced}} that West would be leaving the show in a [...] "dramatic" [...] storyline. Dominic Treadwell-Collins, executive producer, said of West's departure, [...] "When you have an actor of Tim's calibre joining your cast, you treasure every day that you have him - and we knew from the start that Stan's stay {{with the rest of the}} Carter family would be a finite one. But what a stay - and as we draw towards Stan's exit from the show, the audience should get ready as one of Britain's finest actors pulls out all the stops and gives his King Lear..." [...] It was reported on 2 November 2014 that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) would grow suspicious of Stan's whereabouts and when she discovers the truth, order him to tell his family. Over a week later, it {{was announced}} that Stan would confirm he has terminal prostate cancer to his family after Babe hastily tells them at Lee's birthday meal. These scenes were praised by Prostate Cancer UK. On 20 December 2014, Dyer revealed on The Graham Norton Show that Stan would ask Mick to help him die in a new euthanasia storyline. Dyer said, [...] "I'm juggling about eight storylines at the moment. My old man is on his way out. My mother's got Alzheimer's - she's not my mother, my sister's actually my mum. My dad dying - he's not my dad, he's actually my grandad - <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> smother him." [...] The prostate cancer began taking its effect on Stan's health on 23 January 2015 when Stan collapses in mid-commotion. Digital Spy Sophie Dainty reported in January 2015 that the Carters would clash over Stan's request to be killed by his family as Tina agrees to helping him, but Mick firmly disagrees. Mick even informs the family of Stan's request and they strongly disagree. Stan's request was made following his collapse. West praised show bosses for handling Stan's cancer storyline the way they have and their way of handling West's decision to leave the show, [...] "They very kindly said I could have some time out and they would send me to South Africa or prison. But I suggested something finite like death so they decided it would be good for me to have a disease of which I would know about and one where it could be arranged for me to die in six months' time." ...|$|E

"Yes; <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> know that, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> know {{also that}} the {{knowledge}} had come <b>to</b> <b>me</b> from my bishop. I should have thought evil of any one who had sent me the vile ribaldry. But coming from him, it fills me with despair." ...|$|R

"One day Spotkirk came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{and told}} <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do {{a piece of}} {{business}} for him, for which he would pay me twenty-five dollars. I was glad to hear this, for I was greatly in need of money, and I asked him what it was <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|R
60|$|DAISY. He {{sent me a}} message. He wasn't {{satisfied}} with doing a dirty trick. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> know that he'd done it.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well, then, {{you shall}} know. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{re-enter}} political life, {{to be the}} jackal to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{for what}} he said, I may skip that, aunt. It was the old story, I suppose, merely {{signifying}} that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> marry him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be papa and him the coachman. Sometimes I {{make him}} a pirate, and he likes that, and once I made him a girl." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Because <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> help him, and to {{find out}} if you wanted to marry him, so I paid {{particular}} attention to what he said, and--" ...|$|R
