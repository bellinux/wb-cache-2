British authorities attempted to contact <b>his</b> <b>relatives</b> in Lithuania, but Lithuania—as a Soviet Socialist Republic— {{was behind the}} Iron Curtain, and they were advised to stop these attempts since <b>his</b> <b>relatives</b> might suffer negative consequences.

5|$|Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. He kept a concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed <b>his</b> <b>relatives</b> in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul was precisely the sort of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E

5|$|Conroy {{effectively}} barred Victoria {{from anyone}} other than the Duchess or <b>his</b> <b>relatives</b> and the princess was prevented from becoming close to her extended family. The enforced isolation meant the only companions of her own age whom she frequently {{came into contact with}} were Conroy's daughters, who included Victoire, a girl a few months older than Victoria. Victoria {{does not appear to have}} been fond of either Conroy sister as there is little positive comment in her personal journals.|$|E

DeLonge's later public statements regarding the band's music prompted media interest and concern from <b>his</b> <b>relatives</b> and family.|$|E

5|$|Mindaugas, {{the duke}} who governed {{southern}} Lithuania between the Neman and Neris Rivers, eventually became {{the founder of}} the state. Mindaugas {{is referred to as the}} ruler of all Lithuania in the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle in 1236. The means by which he managed to acquire this title are not well known. Russian chronicles mention that he murdered or expelled various other dukes, including <b>his</b> <b>relatives.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Dukedom was {{inherited}} only in {{the male}} line. As the 3rd Duke had three daughters but no son, the title became extinct. The 1st Duke was also Earl Temple of Stowe, a title which descended through heirs of <b>his</b> <b>relatives</b> should the male line become extinct. Consequently, on the 3rd Duke's death this title, {{with most of the}} Wotton estate, passed to his nephew William Temple-Gore-Langton who became the 4th Earl Temple.|$|E

5|$|Though secular {{scholars}} {{consider the}} story to be literary and not historical, circumcision features prominently in the Hebrew Bible.

5|$|Alexander of Lincoln (died February 1148) was {{a medieval}} English Bishop of Lincoln, {{a member of}} an {{important}} administrative and ecclesiastical family. He was the nephew of Roger of Salisbury, a Bishop of Salisbury and Chancellor of England under King Henry I, and he was also related to Nigel, Bishop of Ely. Educated at Laon, Alexander served in his uncle's diocese as an archdeacon in the early 1120s. Unlike <b>his</b> <b>relatives,</b> he held no office in the government before his appointment as Bishop of Lincoln in 1123. Alexander became a frequent visitor to King Henry's court after his elevation to the episcopate, often witnessing royal documents, and he served as a royal justice in Lincolnshire.|$|E
5|$|Although Alexander was a {{frequent}} witness to royal charters and documents, {{there is no evidence}} that he held an official government position after his appointment as bishop, unlike <b>his</b> <b>relatives</b> Roger and Nigel. Nevertheless, Alexander subsequently appears to have become a regular presence at the royal court. He frequently attested royal charters after 1123, and probably acted as a royal justice in Lincolnshire and the town of Lincoln. He also held the royal castles at Newark, Sleaford and Banbury, and gave confirmations of grants to the church at Godstow.|$|E
