5|$|According to {{the mission}} plan, the first {{helicopter}} would <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> the compound's yard while its full team of SEALs fast-roped to the ground. At the same time, the second helicopter would fly to {{the northeast corner of}} the compound and deploy the interpreter, the dog and handler, and four SEALs to secure the perimeter. The team in the courtyard was to enter the house from the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Each level casts {{players as}} a {{different}} colored Yoshi, who must escort Baby Mario {{on his back}} and reach the end of the level, where he is passed on to the next Yoshi. Similar to Super Mario World, Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies and put them into his mouth. When something is in his mouth, Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack, or swallow it to turn it into an egg. These eggs can then be thrown at an angle, even bouncing off walls, to attack enemies or reach far away or hard to reach items. Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time, with some colored eggs spawning items once they hit something. Yoshi can also eat watermelons that let him spit out seeds, or flaming enemies that let him spit out fire. Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump, in which he can kick his legs in mid-air to gain extra height or <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> long distances, and a ground pound, a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps.|$|E
25|$|Like any airship, the Aeroscraft {{may be used}} to {{transport}} cargo to remote or difficult locations and to <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> uneven terrain, in both civil and military use. Its operational independence from runways, ground crews or other infrastructure makes it especially suited to military and emergency relief operations. The large cargo bays would allow outsize cargo such as wind turbines or large aerospace parts to be stored internally.|$|E

25|$|An {{immediate}} {{environmental threat}} is the shrinkage and drying {{out of the}} Lake Urmia located in outskirts of Western Tabriz. The lake has faced a grave crisis since the late 20th century. Water depth reduction, increasing water salinity to saturation level {{and the appearance of}} vast salt fields around the lake, are alarming indications of gradual total desiccation of a unique ecosystem. This occurred due to global warming and ever increasing demands for inadequate fresh water sources in the basin. It is feared in the near future low-lying clouds of airborne salt and minerals may <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> large areas around the lake, posing serious health hazards.|$|E
25|$|Cuckoldry {{occurs in}} many fish species, {{including}} dragonets, parrotfishes and wrasses on tropical reefs and the bluegill sunfish in fresh water. Sneaker males that become {{too large to}} hide effectively become satellite males. With bluegill sunfish, satellite males mimic the behaviour and colouration of the females. They <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> a nest containing a pair of courting sunfish, and gradually descend to reach the pair just as they spawn. Males {{may need to be}} 6 or 7 years old to function capably as parental males, but may be able to function as sneaker or satellite males when they are as young as 2 or 3 years old. The smaller satellite and sneaker males may get mauled by the more powerful parental males, but they spawn when they are younger and they do not put energy into parental care.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major change}} to the Start menu in Windows Vista is {{that it no longer}} {{presents}} the All programs menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a Back button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; the folder needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical scroll bar appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present {{at the top of the}} right column. It changes as users <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> any other item to reflect that item's icon. The Power button's action is configurable through Power options in the Control Panel, though the default setting is to put the computer into Sleep mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the Lock button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the Lock button is clicked.|$|E

500|$|This {{species of}} tropicbird usually forages alone.

Sometimes, this bird follows predators that feed near the surface, such as {{dolphins}} or tuna. The red-billed tropicbird will feed on the fish driven either to or above the surface by the aforementioned predators. It usually forages in warmer waters, though does hunt in areas of cooler currents such as the Gulf of California. The species has also been recorded foraging in salt wedge estuaries.|$|E

500|$|David Huckvale {{identifies}} Wagnerian homage in {{both the}} theme music and the series' premise. Noting that the theme's opening string ostinato is similar in effect to a recurring motif in Ride of the Valkyries, he also likens the Thunderbird machines to Valkyries themselves: [...] "Their function is more benevolent than those warrior maidens, but they do <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> danger, death and destruction." [...] Kevin J. Donnelly of the University of Southampton acknowledges the series' [...] "big-sounding orchestral score", which he compares {{to that of a}} live-action film. He also suggests that the music serves partly to draw attention away from the physical imperfections of the puppets.|$|E
500|$|Sonic R {{features}} ten playable racers, {{each with}} unique attributes and abilities falling {{in line with}} their usual abilities. The title character, Sonic the Hedgehog, is the fastest and possesses the ability to [...] "double jump" [...] (being able to perform a second jump in mid-air). Tails is able to fly through the air for a short time, and Knuckles the Echidna can glide through the air upon jumping. Amy Rose, the last initially available character, drives a car, allowing her to <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> bodies of water and receive extra speed from driving over boost spaces. Secret characters include Sonic's archenemy Dr. Robotnik, who flies in a hovercraft and resists differences in terrain; robotic clones of Sonic (Metal Sonic), Tails (Tails Doll), and Knuckles (Metal Knuckles); Robotnik's robotic assistant EggRobo; and Super Sonic, a faster version of Sonic powered by the Chaos Emeralds.|$|E
500|$|Cwrt (...) , now a large farm, was the {{administrative}} centre of Bardsey Abbey's mainland estates, and {{was known as}} the [...] "Court of Bardsey". The steepest cliffs in the Llŷn Peninsula are at Y Parwyd, the scene of a local ghost story. In 1794 a newly married couple moved into a cottage nearby. Within a few years they were disturbed by a phantom, but when they read a verse from the Bible, the phantom would retreat towards Y Parwyd and <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> the cliff edge before disappearing; the couple finally moved to Bodferin. In 1801 a ship pilot was put ashore on the rocks below the cliffs. Although very drunk, he managed to climb the cliff face and, reaching the top, fell asleep in a sheep pen. In the early morning, he awoke and, still drunk, headed for home; he walked in the wrong direction, however, and disappeared over the cliff edge into the sea.|$|E

500|$|The album's title track, [...] "Music Box", {{is another}} ballad Carey wrote with Afanasieff. The song is {{described}} as one of Carey's more difficult compositions, due to its [...] "softness". The song requires {{a great deal of}} legato to keep [...] "the tunes softness and sweetness, without resorting to volume." [...] Carey's vocals on the track are defined as [...] "soft and controlled," [...] managing to maintain the delicate balance in a manner that seems effortless, floating easily over the keyboard and the shimmer of the guitar. Lyrically, due to the song's message of [...] "commitment and promise," [...] and the [...] "tinkling music-box line played on the synthesizer," [...] the track gives the sensation of a wedding vow recital. [...] "Never Forget You" [...] is a slow song, further connecting it to the song's message of [...] "lamenting the loss of love, in a very tender way." [...] The song contains keyboard notes that <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> the verses and allow Carey to indulge in her backing vocals. It was described by Nickson as a [...] "stand out track," [...] one that could have easily become a hit single, [...] "with an appeal that would have easily transcended generational barriers." ...|$|E
500|$|BUF Compagnie {{served as}} the lead visual effects vender working on the film, with Digital Domain also {{providing}} work on the film. Branagh stated that BUF, who developed the effects for the race through space, were inspired by Hubble photography and other images of deep space. Branagh stated he sent paintings from classic studies by J. M. W. Turner to Digital Domain when creating Jotunheim. Peter Butterworth, VFX supervisor and co-founder of Fuel VFX, said the most challenging task was interpreting what the Bifröst would look like, [...] "You can't Google what these things look like—they are totally imagined and within {{the heads of the}} stakeholders. So to extract that and interpret it for the big screen was an interesting challenge creatively. Technically, probably creating fluid simulations that could be art-directed and used for both the Bifröst and Odin's chamber shots. Part of the difficulty with solving these is that we had to ensure they would work in stereo. In the film, Odin enters {{what is known as the}} [...] "Odinsleep" [...] in his chamber to regenerate. Butterworth stated, [...] "For Odin's Chamber, we developed a dome and curtain of light rays that <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> Odin's bed. This dome of light suggests harnessed power and energy that revitalizes him as he sleeps. We took a lot of reference from the natural world such as the corona of the sun and gave the sleep effect plenty of volume and space".|$|E

The stand was renamed after the Warwickshire and England leg-spinner Eric Hollies in 1989, and was rebuilt in 2003 with 5,900 seats, an increase of 1,300 over its predecessor. The design, which won a Civic Trust Award in 2003, features a series of eight aluminium sunshades suspended over the single tier of seating on simple steel masts, appearing to <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> the crowd beneath.|$|E

2500|$|The unusual {{shape and}} sizable, oily liver of the prickly dogfish {{suggests}} it {{is a slow}} swimmer that can <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> the sea floor with minimal effort. It probably hunts for small, bottom-dwelling invertebrates and fishes, perhaps facilitated by its large nostrils and labial papillae. This species is aplacental viviparous; females have been recorded containing seven or eight mature eggs in their ovaries, and one was gestating seven embryos. Newborns measure about [...] long. Males and females attain sexual maturity around [...] and ≤ long, respectively. A known parasite of the prickly dogfish is the monogenean Asthenocotyle taranakiensis.|$|E
2500|$|Tolstoy was {{instrumental}} in bringing {{a new kind of}} consciousness to the novel. [...] His narrative structure is noted for its [...] "god-like" [...] ability to <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> and within events, but also in the way it swiftly and seamlessly portrayed a particular character's point of view. His use of visual detail is often cinematic in scope, using the literary equivalents of panning, wide shots and close-ups. These devices, while not exclusive to Tolstoy, are part of the new style of the novel that arose in the mid-19th century and of which Tolstoy proved himself a master.|$|E
2500|$|During his Golden Jubilee from 2007-2008 marking 50 {{years of}} Imamate the Aga Khan {{commissioned}} {{a number of}} projects, renowned Pritzker Prize winning Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki was commissioned to design {{a new kind of}} community structure resembling an embassy in Canada, The [...] "Delegation of the Ismaili Imamat" [...] opened on 8 December 2008, the building will be composed of two large interconnected spaces an atrium and a courtyard. The atrium is an interior space to be used all year round. It is protected by a unique glass dome made of multi-faceted, angular planes assembled to create the effect of rock crystal the Aga Khan asked Maki to consider the qualities of [...] "rock crystal" [...] in his design, which during the Fatimid Empire was valued by the Imams. Within the glass dome is an inner layer of woven glass-fibre fabric which will appear to float and <b>hover</b> <b>over</b> the atrium.
