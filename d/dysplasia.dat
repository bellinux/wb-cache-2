5|$|Diagnosis of bronchopulmonary <b>dysplasia</b> in newborn {{infants with}} {{breathing}} difficulties is {{difficult in the}} first few weeks. However, if the infant's breathing does not improve during this time, blood tests and x-rays may be used to confirm bronchopulmonary <b>dysplasia.</b> In addition, an echocardiogram can help to eliminate other possible causes such as congenital heart defects or pulmonary arterial hypertension.|$|E
5|$|The breed is {{generally}} healthy {{with an average}} life span of 12 to 15 years. Hip <b>dysplasia,</b> a genetic malformation of the hip joint, may be a concern {{but because of the}} breed's compact nature is not often seriously debilitating. Surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation For Animals showed that 41.5% of Sussex Spaniels were affected by hip <b>dysplasia,</b> and the breed was ranked 9th worst affected out of 157 breeds.|$|E
5000|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of malignant infantile osteopetrosis includes other genetic skeletal <b>dysplasias</b> that cause osteosclerosis.

30|$|Foetal {{skeletal}} <b>dysplasias</b> {{are usually}} recognised by ultrasound [41, 44 – 46]. However, published reports have described ultrasound as only moderately accurate in {{the detection of}} foetal musculoskeletal anomalies and specific skeletal <b>dysplasias</b> [45, 46], which may indicate a potential future role of MRI in these conditions. Foetal MR imaging may complement the use of molecular genetics to diagnose skeletal <b>dysplasias</b> [33]. After 30  weeks of gestation, conventional radiography of the maternal abdomen may also help to identify possible bone abnormalities [45]. Recent case series report the application of prenatal computed tomography with 3 D reconstructions {{as an adjunct to}} ultrasound in the diagnosis of lethal skeletal <b>dysplasias</b> [47].|$|R
40|$|Skeletal <b>dysplasias</b> are a {{group of}} over 300 genetic {{conditions}} often marked by short stature {{and a range of}} orthopedic problems. To meet the diverse medical, orthopedic, and psychosocial needs of individuals with skeletal <b>dysplasias,</b> the Kathryn O. and Alan C. Greenberg Center for Skeletal <b>Dysplasias</b> was organized at Hospital for Special Surgery in 2003. The center {{is the only one of}} its kind in the New York City metropolitan area and is dedicated to providing comprehensive medical care for individuals with skeletal <b>dysplasias.</b> The center is staffed by an interdisciplinary core team of health professionals consisting of an orthopedic surgeon, a medical geneticist, a genetic counselor/clinical coordinator, and a social worker. This interdisciplinary team of health professionals is committed to improving the quality of life for people with skeletal <b>dysplasias</b> through clinical care, research, education, and patient advocacy. Goals are achieved through a collaborative process that utilizes the expertise of the different professionals...|$|R
5|$|A 1999 {{study of}} Cavaliers {{conducted}} by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation showed that an average of 30% of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels evaluated had eye problems.

5|$|Additional {{concerns}} are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at around {{six months of}} age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs. Hip <b>dysplasia</b> is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. This {{was one of the}} lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. There was no evidence of elbow <b>dysplasia</b> found. The breed has an average life span of 1013 years.|$|E
5|$|An {{abnormal}} {{formation of}} the hip socket, known as hip <b>dysplasia,</b> affected nearly 64% of Pugs in a survey performed by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals; the breed was ranked the second worst-affected by this condition out of 157 breeds tested.|$|E
40|$|Skeletal <b>dysplasias</b> form {{a diverse}} and genetically {{heterogeneous}} group of disorders, but also share many clinical and radiographic features. We describe two illustrative cases {{and provide a}} short {{review of the literature}} on the neurological complications associated with various groups of skeletal <b>dysplasias.</b> These two cases illustrate that management of skeletal <b>dysplasias</b> requires a multidisciplinary approach, aimed at preventing or minimizing medical complications.

40|$|We {{employed}} the {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA), indirect hemagglutination (IHA), and complement fixation (CF) methods to measure antibody titer to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) and type 2 (HSV- 2) in patients affected by labial tumors or cervical <b>dysplasias.</b> No relationship of antibody titer to HSV- 1 and labial tumors was detected {{by any of the}} three methods. Association between antibody titer to HSV- 2 and cervical <b>dysplasias</b> was revealed by IHA (p less than 0. 05) and ELISA (p less than 0. 001); CF tests were negative. Moreover, we assayed for HSV-specific antigens in cell cultures derived from labial tumors and cervical <b>dysplasias.</b> In cultures from labial tumors, {{it was not possible to}} detect HSV-specific antigens. Of the 25 cultures derived from cervical <b>dysplasias,</b> HSV antigens were found in only 3 cultures...|$|R

5|$|Cavaliers {{are also}} {{affected}} by ear problems, a common health problem among spaniels of various types, {{and they can}} suffer from such other general maladies as hip <b>dysplasia,</b> which are common across many types of dog breeds.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{problems}} are also possible in some Labradors, particularly progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, corneal dystrophy and retinal <b>dysplasia.</b> Dogs which {{are intended to}} be bred should be examined by a veterinary ophthalmologist for an eye score.|$|E
5|$|Hip and elbow <b>dysplasia</b> are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems}} such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal <b>dysplasia,</b> and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E

5|$|Hip <b>dysplasia</b> (HD) is {{a common}} genetic disease that affects Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It is not present at birth but {{develops}} with age. Hip <b>dysplasia</b> is diagnosed by X-rays, {{but it is not}} usually evident in X-rays of Cavaliers until they mature. Even in adult spaniels with severe HD, X-rays may not always indicate the disease. In a series of evaluations by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the Cavalier was ranked 78th worst out of 157 breeds. The worst affected breeds were the Bulldog, Pug and Dogue de Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|Hip <b>dysplasia</b> is an {{abnormality}} of the {{hip joint}} which can cause crippling lameness and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with hip <b>dysplasia</b> tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians and Maine Coons. The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in symptoms that are less pronounced. X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic. The Maine Coon is the only cat breed listed in the database.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 DNA in biopsies from precancerous lesions and from early lesions of human cervical cancer, and {{the integration of}} virus DNA into host cell DNA were analysed by dot blot and Southern blot hybridizations. HPV 16 DNA was detected in 23 ~ of mild <b>dysplasias,</b> 329 /o f moderate <b>dysplasias,</b> 55 ~ of severe <b>dysplasias</b> and 62 ~ of carcinomas insitu by dot blot hybridization.

5|$|A {{result of}} <b>dysplasia</b> is usually further investigated, such as {{by taking a}} cone biopsy, which may also remove the {{cancerous}} lesion. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is a possible result of the biopsy, and represents dysplastic changes that may eventually progress to invasive cancer.
