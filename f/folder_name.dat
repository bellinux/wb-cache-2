50|$|A feature {{specific}} to the Soulseek search engine is {{the inclusion of the}} folder names and file paths in the search list.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{an approach that}} can be used to store reference to external documents in a database. The approach, which is hierarchical (taxonomical) in nature, groups each document according to their general to specific attributes. Documents, themselves will be stored in the application server with <b>folder</b> <b>names</b> similar to the tracing of the hierarchical path. Using this method, documents can be easily retrieved by combining the <b>folder</b> <b>names</b> in the hierarchical path. To demonstrate the proposed approach, a database storing maintenance data for storage tanks was developed and discussed in this paper...|$|R

Dots are {{important}} and must be used even for folder names (if there is a dot in the <b>folder</b> <b>name).</b> If there are multiple dots in the long file/directory name, only the last one is used.

Dots aren't used in the required naming scheme for music videos. Square brackets aren't defined in any ruleset, however they are used by p2p groups that do not follow these rules. The best known example is aXXo.|$|E

5000|$|The {{functionality}} {{that was}} discovered and named Master Control Panel or God Mode {{was designed as}} the base folder for searching control panel options using the new start menu's search function. This allows users to type {{what they want to}} do (e. g. “Change screen resolution”) and they will get the right control panel options as search result. The shortcut is implemented by creating a folder with the extension, “” (without quotes). GodMode was the original <b>folder</b> <b>name</b> used when the feature was publicised, but any name can be used. The same functionality can be achieved by creating a standard Windows shortcut with the path “” or by creating a [...] file in a folder that includes the extension's CLSID (Class ID).|$|E
5000|$|DaisyDisk {{displays}} the contents as a color-coded sunburst diagram, resembling the petals of a daisy. The interface places {{the root of}} the hard drive {{at the center of this}} daisy, and displays a hierarchical structure of that hard drive's file system that radiates from that center. This daisy is color-coded to differentiate between folders, while [...] files themselves are always displayed as gray. In the right sidebar of the interface, DaisyDisk also provides a legend for these color codes. When hovering over a file or folder, the right sidebar of the interface updates with contextual information such as the file or <b>folder</b> <b>name</b> and their absolute [...] path. When clicking on a folder on the daisy, a new daisy is displayed with the chosen folder as its root. The interface shows a [...] "breadcrumb trail" [...] of the current folder right above the sunburst diagram.|$|E
5000|$|The virus then rebuilds itself. This {{metamorphic}} process is very complex and accounts for around 90% of the virus' code. After the rebuild, the virus searches for executable files in folders on all fixed and remote drives. Files {{will not be}} infected if they are located in a subfolder more than three levels deep, or if the <b>folder</b> <b>name</b> begins with the letter W. For each file that is found, there is a 50 percent chance {{that it will be}} ignored. Files will not be infected if they begin with F, PA, SC, DR, NO, or if the letter V appears anywhere in the file name. Due {{to the way in which}} the name matching is done, file names that contain certain other characters are also not infected, although this part is not deliberate. The virus contains checks to avoid infecting [...] "goat" [...] or [...] "bait" [...] files (files that are created by anti-virus programs). The infection process uses the structure of the host, as well as random factors, to control the placement of the virus body and the decryptor.|$|E
50|$|When a {{computer}} allows {{the use of}} folders, each file and folder has not only a name of its own, but also a path, which identifies the folder or folders in which a file or folder resides. In the path, some sort of special character—such as a slash—is used to separate the file and <b>folder</b> <b>names.</b> For example, in the illustration shown in this article, the path /Payroll/Salaries/Managers uniquely identifies a file called Managers in a folder called Salaries, {{which in turn is}} contained in a folder called Payroll. The <b>folder</b> and file <b>names</b> are separated by slashes in this example; the topmost or root <b>folder</b> has no <b>name,</b> and so the path begins with a slash (if the root <b>folder</b> had a <b>name,</b> it would precede this first slash).|$|R

30|$|There are two {{additional}} dominant factors {{for the issue}} fix time, based on the analysis of Data source 2 : scan status and <b>folder</b> <b>name.</b> We believe that the factor scan status indicates that the developers address issues based on their perception of whether the given issue is a false positive or not and whether {{it is easy to}} address or not. For example, they may close false positive issues that are easy to analyze and postpone addressing issues that are difficult to analyze and/or fix to, e.g., when the time for the quality gates becomes close. We also expect that the factor “folder name” indicates that the developers behave differently toward issues flagged must fix, fix one of the sets, or optional to fix.|$|E
40|$|Optical {{images of}} {{fingerprints}} generated by manual deposition {{and by the}} Reed-Stanton press rig are reported. In particular 3 sets of images are collected. Set 1, Set 2 and Set 3. In all cases, pre-inked strips were used to produce visible prints and plain white paper was employed as deposition surfaces. Fingerprint Images were captured as jpeg files on the Visual Spectral Comparator (VSC 4 CX, Foster & Freeman, Evesham, UK). Images were uploaded to this data collection as jpeg files as they were created in this format. Set 1 {{is a collection of}} images of a depletion series of 5 “manually deposited fingerprints” and another of 5 fingerprints generated by the press rig; Set 2 is a collection of 4 fingerprints generated by the press rig at a time interval of 1 week; Set 3 is a collection of 10 “manually deposited replicate fingerprints” and 10 replicate fingerprints generated by the Reed-Stanton press rig. Another set of data collected under the <b>folder</b> <b>name</b> of "Ageing data" contains MALDI MS Imaging raw data of silicon stamped fingermarks imaged after ageing for 0, 1, 4 and 8 days.
