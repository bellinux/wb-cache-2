5|$|As a {{composer}} and pianist, Sorabji was largely self-taught, and he {{distanced himself from}} the main currents of contemporary musical life early in his career. He developed a highly idiosyncratic musical language, with roots in composers as diverse as Busoni, Debussy and Szymanowski, and <b>he</b> <b>dismissed</b> large portions of the established and contemporary repertoire.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong began regular Sheffield Shield cricket in the 1899–1900 season. In {{his first}} match against New South Wales in January 1900, <b>he</b> <b>dismissed</b> Syd Gregory {{with his second}} {{delivery}} and scored 45runs in the second innings.

5|$|Fans {{and writers}} regard the treble haul as manager Alex Ferguson's finest hour, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>dismissed</b> that assertion in later years. Tens {{of thousands of}} fans lined the streets of Manchester to welcome the team as the season drew to a close. In recognition of his achievements Ferguson was awarded a knighthood, and handed the Freedom of the City of Glasgow in November 1999.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the home side's 138, Hassett top-scored with 68 in Australia's first innings of 254 before being trapped leg before wicket by Eric Hollies as the tourists defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. Hollies's 8/107 was the best innings bowling figures against the Australians for the summer. The feat earned him selection for the Fifth Test, where <b>he</b> <b>dismissed</b> Bradman in his final Test innings for a duck.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{played in}} Australia's only match before the Fourth Test, which was against Middlesex. <b>He</b> <b>dismissed</b> Jack Robertson, Edrich and John Dewes {{to leave the}} hosts at 4/92 and ended with 3/43 as they were bowled out for 203.

Bradman’s men {{went on to win}} by ten wickets.|$|E
5|$|One final attempt, {{organised}} by Babić, {{was made}} to revive the Z-4 Plan on 16 August. This initiative called for negotiating each point of the plan and extending the autonomous areas to eastern Slavonia. However, Ahrens and Stoltenberg considered any talks between Croatia and the exiled, discredited leaders of the RSK impossible. When they consulted Šarinić about the initiative, <b>he</b> <b>dismissed</b> any possibility of negotiation.|$|E
5000|$|Edwards made {{a single}} {{first-class}} appearance for Sussex against Lancashire at the County Ground, Hove in 1885. [...] <b>He</b> was <b>dismissed</b> for a duck twice in this match. <b>He</b> was <b>dismissed</b> by Johnny Briggs in Sussex's first-innings, while in their second-innings <b>he</b> was <b>dismissed</b> by Dick Barlow.

5|$|The {{following}} 1947–48 season, Toshack {{warmed up}} for the Test campaign against the touring Indians by taking 2/64 and 4/65 for New South Wales in an innings win, dismissing Hemu Adhikari twice. He retained his position in the national team, and in the First Test at Brisbane on a wet pitch, Toshack took ten wickets for {{the only time in}} his Test career. In reply to Australia's 8/382 declared, India had been reduced to 5/23 by Lindwall, Miller and Bill Johnston before Vijay Hazare and captain Lala Amarnath took the score to 53 without further loss, prompting Toshack's introduction into the attack. <b>He</b> <b>dismissed</b> both and removed the remaining lower-order batsmen to end with 5/2 in 19 balls as India were bowled out after adding only five further runs. Bradman enforced the follow on and India reached 1/27 before a spell of 6/29 from Toshack reduced them to 8/89, including the wickets of Hazare, Amarnath and Khanderao Rangnekar for a second time. India were bowled out for 98 as Australia won by an innings and 226 runs. Injury persistently curtailed Toshack during the season, and he missed a month of cricket, including the next two Tests. He returned for the second match against arch-rivals Victoria, and took 6/38 and 2/71 to {{play a key role in}} a New South Wales victory by six wickets. His victims in the first innings included Test batsmen Lindsay Hassett, Neil Harvey and Sam Loxton as New South Wales took a decisive 290-run lead. <b>He</b> <b>dismissed</b> Hassett and Ken Meuleman in the second innings to help set up victory. Toshack only played in one further Test during the season, the Fourth, where he was less successful with match figures of 2/139. <b>He</b> <b>dismissed</b> centurion Dattu Phadkar as Australia went on to win the series 4–0. When fit, Toshack was a heavy wicket-taker; his 41 wickets at 20.26 placed him second only to Bill Johnston's 42 among Australian bowlers for the season.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} a year since the band's last concert, Megadeth {{returned}} as a live act in June 1997, beginning a world tour with the Misfits and touring in the United States with Life of Agony and Coal Chamber. In July, the band participated in Ozzfest '98 but, halfway through the tour, Menza reportedly discovered a tumor on his knee and left to undergo surgery. Jimmy DeGrasso, who had collaborated with Mustaine in MD.45, was hired to replace Menza {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Though initially meant to be a temporary replacement, DeGrasso joined the band permanently after the tour. Mustaine later said that <b>he</b> <b>dismissed</b> Menza from the band because he believed the drummer had lied about having cancer.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the film's {{success and}} wide-reaching popularity, Saran remade it in Telugu as Gemeni. It {{is the only}} film Saran made in a {{language}} other than Tamil. The remake starred Venkatesh and Namitha in the lead roles, while Kalabhavan Mani and Murali reprised their roles from the Tamil version. Most of the crew members were retained. Posani Krishna Murali translated the dialogues to Telugu. The soundtrack was composed by R. P. Patnaik, who reused most of the tunes from the original film. Released in October 2002, the film received lukewarm response and failed to repeat {{the success of the}} original. In 2013, a Kannada remake was reported to have been planned with Upendra in the lead, but <b>he</b> <b>dismissed</b> the reports as rumours.|$|E

5|$|Ernest was {{an active}} member of the House of Lords, where he {{maintained}} an extremely conservative voting record. There were persistent allegations (reportedly spread by his political foes) that he had murdered his valet and had fathered a son by his sister, Princess Sophia. Before Victoria succeeded to the British throne, it was rumoured that Ernest intended to murder her and take the throne himself. When King William IV died on 20 June 1837, Ernest acceded to the Hanoverian throne. Becoming Hanover's first ruler to reside in the state since George I, he had a generally successful fourteen-year reign but excited controversy when <b>he</b> <b>dismissed</b> the Göttingen Seven (including the two Brothers Grimm) from their professorial positions for agitating against his policies.|$|E
5|$|He {{was then}} {{selected}} {{to make his}} Sheffield Shield debut a week later, against Western Australia at the WACA Ground in Perth. Illingworth came in at 6/168 and made 25 before being run out in his team's 208. Bowling first change, <b>he</b> <b>dismissed</b> both openers to leave the hosts at 2/60, before they recovered to take a 183-run lead. Illingworth ended with 2/53. He then scored 14 as Victoria set a target of 180. Illingworth then took 0/20 from ten overs before time ran out with Western Australia on 1/50.|$|E
5|$|King Andrew died on 21 September 1235. Béla, {{who succeeded}} his father without opposition, was crowned king in Székesfehérvár on 14 October. <b>He</b> <b>dismissed</b> and punished {{many of his}} father's closest advisors. For instance, he had Palatine Denis blinded and Julius Kán imprisoned. The former was accused of having, in King Andrew's life, an adulterous liaison with Queen Beatrix, the King's young widow. Béla ordered her imprisonment, but she managed to escape to the Holy Roman Empire, where {{she gave birth to}} a posthumous son, Stephen. Béla and his brother Coloman {{considered}} her son a bastard.|$|E

5|$|Princess Ida (1884) spoofed women's {{education}} and male chauvinism and continued {{the theme from}} Iolanthe of the war between the sexes. The opera is based on Tennyson's poem The Princess: A Medley. Gilbert had written a blank verse farce {{based on the same}} material in 1870, called The Princess, and he reused {{a good deal of the}} dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of Princess Ida. Ida is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts. Lillian Russell had been engaged to create the title role, but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, <b>he</b> <b>dismissed</b> her.|$|E
5|$|Smith said he {{understood}} this would irk the British, but {{insisted that he}} and his government were no longer willing to wait. He had repeatedly offered to respect the judgement of an impartial arbitration team, he reminded Johnston, but the British had shot this idea down each time. He therefore felt compelled to follow the advice given by his own legal team, which was that the appointment was legitimate. His government would not accept a lesser appointment in Lisbon than in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques. <b>He</b> <b>dismissed</b> Johnston's threat to expel the Rhodesian representatives in West Germany, Japan and America; relations with Portugal and South Africa were far more important, he said, as they were Rhodesia's two closest neighbours geographically.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural {{game of the}} new {{club was}} played against George Gibbons Hearne's Eleven, which {{included}} {{many members of the}} famous cricketing Hearne family. Hearne's team won by 21 runs. On 5 June 1886, in a match between Blackheath and a gentleman's touring team called the Band of Brothers, led by Lord Harris, Druitt bowled Harris for 14 and took three other wickets. Blackheath won by 178 runs. Two weeks later, <b>he</b> <b>dismissed</b> England batsman John Shuter, who was playing for Bexley Cricket Club, for a duck, and Blackheath won the game by 114 runs. The following year, Shuter returned to Blackheath with a Surrey County side that included Walter Read, William Lockwood, and Bobby Abel, whom Druitt bowled out for 56. Surrey won by 147 runs.|$|E

50|$|Verdoux {{is exposed}} and convicted of murder. Before being {{led to the}} guillotine, <b>he</b> <b>dismisses</b> his killing of a few, for {{which he has been}} condemned, as no worse than the killing of many in war, for which others are honored.|$|R
5|$|The {{views of}} the Croatian {{leadership}} {{on how to deal}} with the JNA's role in the Croatian Serb revolt gradually evolved between January and September 1991. Croatian President Franjo Tuđman's initial plan was to win European Community (EC) and United States support, so <b>he</b> <b>dismissed</b> Špegelj's advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in Croatia in late 1990. During the Ten-Day War in June and July 1991, Špegelj once again urged Tuđman to act while the JNA fought Slovenia's TO. Špegelj's calls were echoed by Šime Đodan, who succeeded him as Defence Minister in July. Špegelj remained in command of the ZNG.|$|E

5|$|With Kogălniceanu's participation, {{the authoritarian}} regime {{established}} by Cuza succeeded in promulgating {{a series of}} reforms, notably introducing the Napoleonic code, public education, and state monopolies on alcohol and tobacco. At the same time, the regime became unstable and was contested by all sides, especially after his adulterous affair with Marija Obrenović became the topic of scandal. In early 1865, Cuza came into conflict with his main ally Kogălniceanu, whom <b>he</b> <b>dismissed</b> soon after. Over the following months, the administration went into financial collapse, {{no longer able to}} provide state salaries, while Cuza came to rely on his own camarilla (courtiers).|$|E
