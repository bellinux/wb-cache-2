2500|$|At {{one o'clock}} {{on the morning}} of April 2, 1865, my {{regiment}} broke camp near Petersburg, Va., and moved up to the enemy's front. Brigade pioneers and sharpshooters were ordered to rush in advance of the brigade. The pioneers were to remove all obstacles in front of the enemy's works, while the sharpshooters covered the parapet. I was at that time detailed as sergeant of the Third Brigade pioneers, and was second in command in the assault. The part of the line we were expected to carry was made of enclosed works, connected by breastworks of great strength with outer obstructions in the form of two lines of chevaux de frise and two lines of abatis. It was impossible to take the works while the enemy defended them, unless the several lines of obstruction were first removed. As Lieutenant Shiver was wounded early in the attack the command fell on me, and in directing the removal of the first two lines of the obstructions I received a shot over my ear and one in my left side and while removing the third line, a bullet shattered my right <b>knee-joint,</b> costing me, subsequently, the loss of my leg. Supporting myself on the abatis, I gave my orders to my men, and at last had the satisfaction of seeing them carry away the obstruction, thus enabling General Edwards to rout the enemy and cut the railroad and telegraph. The flag of the Thirty-seventh Massachusetts was the first to wave over the enemy's works.|$|E

40|$|A case of {{synovial}} chondromatosis originating from the synovium of the {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) resulting in a mechanical block to knee extension is reported. A 36 -year-old man complained of a restricted range of left-knee motion and pain when walking. Plain roentgenograms showed normal appearance, however, magnetic resonance imaging showed intensity changes in the ACL. Arthroscopically, numerous small free bodies were observed. Proliferation of synovium and cartilaginous tissues were identified around the ACL. There were no significant findings in the synovium except around the ACL. The synovium around the ACL was resected and free bodies were washed out. This is the first report of {{synovial chondromatosis}} originating from the synovium of the ACL.

40|$|The use of glass-fibre {{reinforced}} polymers as {{main reinforcement}} in concrete structures {{has become an}} appealing option for structures in aggressive environments. Concrete <b>knee-joints</b> are joints where the beam and column both terminate at the joint. The application GFRP reinforcement in <b>knee-joints</b> may be problematic considering the weak link at the reinforcement bend. This is critical {{because there is a}} risk of premature failure in the joint due to bar rupture, regardless of adjoining member designs. The behaviour of <b>knee-joints</b> reinforced with GFRP has not been studied before. The presented experimental program consists of eight full scale specimens which were tested under monotonic closing loads. The variables studied are the effect of varying reinforcement ratio, the effect of confinement stirrups in the joint, and the effect of corner geometry. The eight specimens are divided into two groups, confined and unconfined specimens. Of the eight specimens, two are designed with an altered geometry to include an interior chamfer. Test results indicate that an increase in reinforcement ratio improves the strength efficiency while directly altering the failure mode: Failure by bar rupture as the reinforcement ratio increased was prevented and occurred by failure of diagonal strut. The addition of confinement stirrups significantly increased the ultimate strength as well as the maximum deflection. The effect of changing corner geometry has a minor effect on the specimen strength; however, brittle failure in the joint was prevented. Further studies must be conducted including different confinement techniques, different FRP types and suppliers, as well as different loading types such as opening moments and load reversals...|$|R

These can be made of a single goat-skin, of sufficient power, in skilful hands, to raise small bars of iron to a welding heat. The boat's head is cut off close under the chin, his legs at the <b>knee-joint,</b> and a slit is made between the hind legs, through which the carcase is entirely extracted.After dressing the hide, two strongish pieces of wood are sewn along the slit, one at each side, just like the ironwork {{on each side of the}} mouth of a carpet-bag, and for the same purpose, i.e. to strengthen it: a nozzle is inserted at the neck. To use this apparatus, its mouth is opened, and pulled out; then it is suddenly shut, by which means the bellows are made to enclose a bagful of air; this, by pushing the mouth flat home, is ejected through the nozzle. These bellows require no valve, and are the simplest that can be made: they are in use throughout India. The nozzle or tube to convey the blast may be made of a plaster of clay or loam, mixed with grass, and moulded round a smooth pole.|$|E

She was not a sullen person; she was headstrong and violent--easily excited to fly into a passion, and quite reckless in her fits of anger as to what she said or did. At such times I really hardly think she knew what she was about. My own idea is that her temper was made still more irritable by unhappiness in her married life. She was far from being a reserved person. Indeed, she was disposed (as I thought) to be a little too communicative about herself and her troubles with persons like me who were beneath her in station. She did not scruple, for instance, to tell me (when we had been long enough together to get used to each other) that she was very unhappy, and fretted a good deal about her husband.

Why is the crane so thin? Once {{he was a man}} named Kar-ween, the second man fashioned out of clay by Pund-jel, a singular creative being, whose chequered career is traced elsewhere in our chapter on [...] "Savage Myths of the Origin of the World and of Man". Kar-ween and Pund-jel had a quarrel about the wives of the former, whom Pund-jel was inclined to admire. The crafty Kar-ween gave a dance (jugargiull, corobboree), at which the creator Pund-jel was disporting himself gaily (like the Great Panjandrum), when Kar-ween pinned him with a spear. Pund-jel threw another which took Kar-ween in the <b>knee-joint,</b> so that he could not walk, but soon pined away and became a mere skeleton. [...] "Thereupon Pund-jel made Kar-ween a crane," [...] and that is why the crane has such attenuated legs. The Kortume, Munkari and Waingilhe, now birds, were once men.

He walked up and down, looking on the floor--his usual custom when undecided. That stiffness about the arm, hip, and <b>knee-joint</b> which was apparent when he walked was the net product of the divers sprains and over-exertions that had been required of him in handling trees and timber when a young man, for he was of the sort called self-made, and had worked hard.

But treacherous Time had been only hiding ill results when they could be guarded against, for greater accumulation when they could not. In his declining years the store had been unfolded in the form of rheumatisms, pricks, and spasms, in every one of which Melbury recognized some act which, had its consequence been contemporaneously made known, he would wisely have abstained from repeating.|$|E

40|$|Polyethylene wear is a {{major cause}} of aseptic {{loosening}} of knee endoprostheses. In clinical use the long-term wear resistance of a specific tibial plateau in artificial <b>knee-joints</b> will depend on numerous factors, including the type of polyethylene from which it was fabricated, the fabrication, the type of sterilization used, the type of implant (high or low conformity knees), the duration of shelf-storage prior to implantation, duration of use in vivo, and depth within the polymer to which wear has progressed. The influence of each of these complex and interactive parameters on the long-term wear resistance of polyethylene components is discussed in this work. Therefore, goal of this work was the description of specific material-properties of polyethylene as the tibial plateau in artificial <b>knee-joints.</b> Especially the material-properties of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) as a bearing-component in knee-prostheses were demonstrated. After an introduction with basic knowledge about the material science of polymers, there is a digest about the history of UHMWPE as a tibial component in knee-prostheses. A description of major problems of polyethylene in clinical use is followed by a discussion of the available methods of sterilization of orthopaedic implants made of polymers. Good in vitro results in long-term-resistance were achieved by WIRTZ et al., minimizing mechanical wear of UHMWPE by stretch-modifying the structure of polyethylene. Translating these results to unidirectional tractive rolling on the tibial plateau in the knee joint suggests that a significant reduction in polyethylene wear can be expected.
