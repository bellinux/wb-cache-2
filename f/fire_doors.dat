5|$|Aboard the ship, {{passenger}} John Geiger hacks {{into the}} ship's computer system, {{and the following}} evening, he destroys the ship's communication systems and kills the captain. After remotely shutting down the ship's engines, Geiger calls the bridge to tell the first officer, Juliano, that the captain is dead and he is in charge. Juliano is ordered by Geiger to evacuate the ship. Geiger steals jewelry from the ship's vault. As passengers evacuate, Drew, a young deaf girl, becomes trapped in an elevator, {{and a group of}} people become trapped behind locked <b>fire</b> <b>doors</b> in a hallway filling with smoke. As Annie and Alex attempt to board the last lifeboat, Geiger programs the ship to continue sailing. The winch lowering the lifeboat jams. Alex jumps into the boat to rescue the passengers who are falling off, and Annie and Juliano use the ship's gangplank to get them back on deck.|$|E
5|$|Alex realizes Geiger is {{controlling}} the ship. Armed with skeet guns, he goes with Juliano to Geiger's cabin. Geiger remotely detonates explosives inside the room. Annie and Dante, the ship's photographer, notice the people trapped behind the <b>fire</b> <b>doors,</b> and Annie uses a chainsaw {{to cut the}} door open and let them out. Meanwhile, Alex orders the navigator, Merced, to flood the ship and slow it down by opening the ballast doors. As the ship floods, Alex sees Drew on a monitor after she climbs out of the elevator, and runs to save her. Alex notices Geiger leaving the vault and holds him at gunpoint, but he escapes by closing the fire door in front of him. Using the ship's intercom, Geiger explains that he designed the ship's autopilot system and is taking revenge against the cruise line after being fired when he got sick from copper poisoning. Geiger again escapes from Alex by attaching a grenade to a door.|$|E

25|$|The {{library was}} {{designed}} in Gothic revival style and was fire resistant, being constructed of masonry. The third {{story of the}} design was not built to save money. It had an iron fire-door separating the library from the main entrance section. This saved the library from the fire of 1907 which destroyed {{the rest of the}} timber parliament buildings. Coincidentally, exactly the same thing happened in Ottawa in 1916—with <b>fire</b> <b>doors</b> saving the Library when the Centre Block of the Canadian Parliament burned.|$|E
25|$|Italian {{authorities}} {{opened a}} criminal investigation into the fire. The investigation would {{determine whether or not}} criminal negligence played a part in the fire. Judge Giuseppe Volpe {{is in charge of the}} investigation, which could bring charges of culpable shipwreck. The ship had been inspected at Patras, Greece on 19 December; six serious deficiencies had been found, relating to emergency lighting, <b>fire</b> <b>doors</b> and lifesaving capacity on board the vessel. The owners had been served with a notice giving them fifteen days to remedy the deficiencies.|$|E
40|$|The {{pressurized}} {{smoke control}} system {{is important for}} fire safety in building because it is directly concerned with egress time of people.

The research for a position of damper effects on dis-tribution of air flow at the <b>fire</b> <b>door</b> is not performed. In this study, numerical simulation using FDS 5. 5 was carried out to analyze the effect of the position of damper on flow distribution at the <b>fire</b> <b>door.</b> To simulate real situation, effects of opening and closing of <b>fire</b> <b>door</b> was considered.

25|$|Due to its {{enclosed}} sub-surface platforms, New Street {{was designated}} as an underground station {{by the fire}} service. In the 1990s a number of changes {{had to be made}} to the station in order to comply with stricter fire regulations, introduced for underground stations {{as a result of the}} 1987 King's Cross fire. In 1993, a new enclosed footbridge was opened at the Wolverhampton end of the station, with access to the platforms separate from the main building: this was built primarily as a fire exit, but the new exit from the station into Navigation Street was opened to the public. All wooden fittings were removed from the platforms, and new <b>fire</b> <b>doors</b> were also installed at the foot of the stairs and elevators on the platforms.|$|E
25|$|The tower levels (L1 - L9) each {{comprise}} long, {{open floor}} plans with later lightweight partitions. Window sills are black terrazzo. Small services cores bookend each floor, {{on the east}} and west sides of the tower. These contain fire stairs, service risers, store rooms, and kitchenettes. Some levels retain original black bean veneer <b>fire</b> <b>doors.</b> The top level of the tower (L10) contains two large auditoriums. The larger of the two, named the Charles Barton Auditorium, is double-height and has a raised stage with a proscenium arch, velvet curtains, wings spaces either side, and a backstage area with changing rooms. Under the stage is a storage area accessed via original, battened timber doors. The auditoriums are serviced by a single projection room on a mezzanine between the rooms, accessed via a narrow timber stair.|$|E

After that it was adopted {{for use as a}} kindergarten and offices for the trustees. Described as [...] "vaguely Italianate", the one-room church hall has a basement and a T-shaped addition dating to around 1928. It has a steep gabled, hipped roof.

Frank Vanderlip Jr., ten {{years old at the}} time, later recalled that he saw the detonation shake the jammed theater building, and that Paderewski had played on as if nothing had happened. The automatic <b>fire</b> <b>doors</b> {{at the top of the}} theater had sprung open, and two men were sent aloft to sit on them until the end of the performance to prevent a cold draft from entering the room.|$|E
500|$|In 2004–2005 the Brudenell {{was placed}} on a [...] "final warning" [...] {{following}} noise complaints and had to stop putting on shows.

In response to a change in the United Kingdom's licensing laws and the smoking ban implemented in England in 2007, which made it illegal to smoke in enclosed work places, the Brudenell moved from being a member's club to an entirely public venture—a [...] "publicly open, licensed place that runs as a social enterprise and reinvests its money"—with Nathan believing that the venue had to [...] "evolve or die".|$|E
500|$|A {{renovation}} {{plan was}} finally announced in April 2015. The work began on 18 April 2016. It {{was to be}} done in three phases: the first phase was the renovation of the tunnel, the second phase the addition of a lift to Gornji Grad surface, and the third phase adding cultural facilities to attract tourists. A sum of 1,350,000 kuna (...) was allocated for the first phase. The renovation phase was completed on 6 July and the Grič Tunnel was officially opened to the public. Only the Mesnička Street entrance, Art Park exit and Tomić Street exit were opened at the time; Radić Street and Ilica 28 and 30 entrances remained closed. The execution of the renovation was criticised for not following safety precautions; the tunnel was said to be damp and to lack smoke detectors, <b>fire</b> <b>doors,</b> sprinklers, or a mechanical ventilation system, and the fire escape route was problematic because two exits were narrowed to allow space for toilets.|$|E
