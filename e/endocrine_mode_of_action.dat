40|$|Female mammals are {{classified}} into spontaneous and induced ovulators {{based on the}} mechanism eliciting ovulation. Ovulation in spontaneous species (e. g., human, sheep, cattle, horse, pigs, and most rodents) occurs at regular intervals and depends upon the circulating estradiol. However, in induced ovulators (e. g., rabbits, ferrets, cats, and camelids), ovulation is associated with coitus. In the later, various factors have been proposed to trigger ovulation, including auditory, visual, olfactory, and mechanic stimuli. However, other studies have identified a biochemical component in the semen of induced ovulators responsible for the induction of ovulation and named accordingly ovulation-inducing factor (OIF). In camelids, intramuscular or intrauterine administration of seminal plasma (SP) was shown to induce the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge followed by ovulation and subsequent formation of corpus luteum. Recently, this OIF has been identified from SP as a neurotrophin, the β subunit of nerve growth factor (β-NGF). β-NGF is well known as promoting neuron survival and growth, but in this case, it appears to induce ovulation through an <b>endocrine</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Indeed, β-NGF may be absorbed through the endometrium to be conveyed, via the blood stream, to the central structures regulating the LH preovulatory surge.

Thus, aquatic vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, are most endangered. ED can adversely affect reproductive biology and the thyroid system. ED act by (anti) estrogenic and (anti) androgenic <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> resulting in abnormal sexual differentiation and impaired reproduction. These effects are mainly driven by direct interferences of ED with sex steroid receptors rather than indirectly by impacting synthesis and bioavailability of sex steroids, which in turn might affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Recent findings reveal that, {{in addition to the}} human-produced waste of ED, natural sources, such as parasites and decomposition of leaves, also might act as ED, markedly affecting sexual differentiation and reproduction in fish and amphibians. Although the thyroid system has essential functions in both fish and amphibians, amphibian metamorphosis has been introduced as the most sensitive model to detect thyroidal ED; no suitable fish model exists. Whereas ED may act primarily on only one specific endocrine target, all endocrine systems will eventually be deregulated as they are intimately connected to each other.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} project was to {{identify}} the most relevant factors increasing {{the uncertainty of the}} environmental risk assessment (ERA) of endocrine active substances as compared to baseline toxicants. The evaluation was supported by data on endocrine effects of six model substances on fish and aquatic invertebrates. Two key factors were identified: (1) The current evaluation of endocrine effects only covers effects on the estrogen / androgen and thyroid axis, while other <b>endocrine</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and, especially, effects on invertebrates are insufficiently covered. (2) At present, it is difficult to assess whether the results of tests with few standard test species are protective for all wildlife species. For fish, effect concentrations in species with similar metabolic capacities are often in the same order of magnitude, but larger differences are observed between species that differ in their metabolic capacities. For invertebrates, cross-species extrapolation is far more complex. This is due to the much higher diversity and heterogeneity of invertebrates and the often fragmentary knowledge on endocrine effects and the underlying processes. The uncertainty of the ERA of endocrine active substances is also increased by mixture effects. It may be increased if worst case exposure conditions coincide with sensitive developmental windows. Further factors (e. g. the irreversibility of effects, effects on the reproductive behaviour, and effects with uncertain population relevance and low-dose effects) and the specificity of the identified factors for endocrine active substances are discussed...|$|R

The RBA-values ranged from 1. 0 to 4. 4 (estradiol: RBA = 100). The endocrine {{activities of the}} complexes and their ligands, determined in the mouse uterine weight test, are low. All compounds entered comparative tests using estrogen receptor-positive and negative mammary tumors models. The receptor levels in these tumors were determined by a modified h. p. l. c. micro assay. In cell culture, a growth inhibiting effect was only observed in hormone-sensitive MCF- 7 cells, but not in hormone-independent MDA-MB- 231 cells. At 10 (- 6) molar, the cell number was generally decreased by 50 %. In vivo, the growth of estrogen receptor-positive MXT mouse tumors was strongly inhibited whereas the hormone-independent MXT mammary tumors showed only a minor response. The most active compound was the platinum complex with a xylidene spacer group (4 d-PtCl 2) showing a reduction of tumor weight of 84 % after 6 weeks of treatment (3 x 20 mg/kg/week).

(2011) wherein biological plausibility and epidemiological evidence were combined to conclude that a {{causal relationship}} between atrazine exposure and breast cancer is “unlikely”. Carcinogenicity studies in female Sprague-Dawley (SD) but not Fischer- 344 rats indicate that high doses of atrazine caused a decreased latency and an increased incidence of combined adenocarcinoma and fibroadenoma mammary tumors. There were no effects of atrazine on any other tumor type in male or female SD or Fischer- 344 rats or in three strains of mice. Seven key events that precede tumor expression in female SD rats were identified. Atrazine induces mammary tumors in aging female SD rats by suppressing the luteinizing hormone surge, thereby supporting a state of persistent estrus and prolonged exposure to endogenous estrogen and prolactin. This <b>endocrine</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> has low biological plausibility for women because women who undergo reproductive senescence have low rather than elevated levels of estrogen and prolactin. Four alternative modes of action (genotoxicity, estrogenicity, upregulation of aromatase gene expression or delayed mammary gland development) were considered and none {{could account for the}} tumor response in SD rats. Epidemiological studies provide no support for a causal relationship between atrazine exposure and breast cancer. This conclusion is consistent with International Agency for Research on Cancer’s classification of atrazine as “unclassifiable as to carcinogenicity” and the United States Environmental Protection Agency's classification of atrazine as “not likely to be carcinogenic. ...|$|E

In the FSTRA, fathead minnows were exposed to mean measured 2, 4 -D concentrations of 0 (water control), 0. 245, 3. 14, 34. 0, and 96. 5 mg ae/L for 21 days. The respective concentrations of 2, 4 -D were not overtly toxic to either Xenopus laevis tadpoles or fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). In the AMA, {{there were no signs}} of either advanced or delayed development, asynchronous development, or significant histopathological effects of the thyroid gland among 2, 4 -D exposed tadpoles evaluated on either day seven or day 21 of the exposure. Therefore, following the AMA decision logic, 2, 4 -D is considered “likely thyroid inactive” in the AMA with a No Observable Effect Concentration (NOEC) of 113 mg ae 2, 4 -D/L.

40|$|The {{first part}} of the present {{dissertation}} assesses genotoxic effects of environmental samples (e. g. sediment, fish blood) from the River Danube and the Tietê River in Brazil. The genotoxic potentials of both rivers were determined by means of the comet assay and the micronucleus test. The results, regarding the ecological status of the Danube River, reveal an overall moderate to severe genotoxic potential with a highly differential localization. Regarding the Tietê River, strong hazard potentials could especially be detected in samples from Billings reservoir, indicating a major impact of discharges of São Paulo. Overall, however, genotoxicity decreases downstream. In situ observations (i. e. the micronucleus test with fish erythrocytes) on the River Danube and the Tietê River showed excellent correlation with corresponding in vitro tests (i. e. the comet assay and the micronucleus test with RTL-W 1 cells) and document the ecological relevance of in vitro studies with sediment extracts. In order to extend the usage of the micronucleus test, modified versions were tested. Results demonstrated that the micronucleus assay with fixed (liver) tissues and the modified micronucleus test with homogenized zebrafish embryos represent valuable tools for the in vivo identification of the mutagenic potentials of pure substances, environmental samples and field locations. As a next step, the genotoxic hazard potential of trenbolone, a model androgen, was tested in vitro in the permanent fish cell line RTL-W 1 as well as in primary cell cultures derived from zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos after in vivo exposure. Results confirm the conclusion that the steroid trenbolone may act as a genotoxic substance. Once the genotoxicity of trenbolone was assessed in the micronucleus test and the comet assay in vitro (with RTL-W 1 cells) and in vivo (with zebrafish embryo cell suspensions), the uptake pattern of trenbolone in zebrafish embryos was investigated in order to assess if the observed genotoxicity is linked to a certain tissue in the zebrafish embryos. The results demonstrate that trenbolone has easy access to all tissues of the embryonic and larval stages of zebrafish and thus no masking of genotoxic effects is expected. Knowing that trenbolone is ubiquitous {{in the body of the}} zebrafish embryo, the question emerges if this substance might have further impact on organisms than the genotoxicity observed and the known endocrine effect. Thus, a two generation test with trenbolone was performed, which revealed that the major effect was the masculinisation in the F 1 generation. The significant changes in length were the only effects observed, which could not exclusively be related to an endocrine effect. The last part of this thesis was a validation of a definite fish test (full life-cycle/two generation) with zebrafish. For this end, beside trenbolone, the anti-androgen flutamide and the anti-estrogen tamoxifen citrate were tested in multi-generation tests. Currently available fish screening assays cover only mechanisms of endocrine action related to sexual endocrine disrupting chemicals. For substances other than sexual endocrine disruptors, there is no possibility to apply a tiered testing strategy. In such cases, a fish life-cycle and/or multigenerational test, as definitive test, is directly required to eliminate reasonable suspicion of an <b>endocrine</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Therefore, it is advisable that future studies focus on harmonization and validation of several elements of the available guidance for fish full lifecycle tests and 2 -generation tests...|$|E
40|$|Endocrine {{disruption}} can impact {{health and}} reproduction in wildlife {{and is therefore}} highly concerned in the environmental risk assessment. The current approach {{in the evaluation of}} endocrine disruption relies on long-term reproductive and animal intensive studies, which implicit time consuming and cost intensive tests. Thus, there is an increasing demand for alternative testing. This thesis intended to examine the suitability of the fish embryo test as such an alternative approach in testing endocrine disruptive chemicals. Although in fish embryos, reproductive organs are not developed and morphological effects cannot be linked to a specific <b>endocrine</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> endocrine genes have been previously reported to be responsive to endocrine disrupters already in the embryonic stage. It was therefore hypothesized that gene expression analysis can be a tool for the detection and evaluation of endocrine disruption in fish embryos. To corroborate this hypothesis, endocrine compounds which are known or suspected to cause estrogenic or anti-androgenic effects were tested for their impact on embryonic gene expression. Further, two complementary fish species, zebrafish and medaka, were used to address differences in species-specific responses and to elaborate distinctive advantages for EDC testing. For zebrafish, microarray technology was applied to detect transcriptome response to estrogens and anti-androgens, whereas for medaka, the expression of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and, for comparative purposes, also of selected genes which appeared indicative for estrogenic and anti-androgenic disrupion in the zebrafish microarray results. The microarray results for 48 hpf zebrafish showed a clearly discernible transcriptome profile for 17 alpha- ethinylestradiol (EE 2) and flutamide. The comparison of the further tested endocrine disruptors to the reference compounds allowed a categorization of the corresponding mechanism of action. The gene response to BPA and propanil was predominantly estrogenic and anti-androgenic, respectively. Genistein, linuron and prochloraz showed multiple mechanisms of actions, which comprised estrogenic as well as anti-androgenic effects. Methylparaben showed a contrary response to EE 2 and therefore was hypothesized to act anti-estrogenic. Apart from the common regulation of the biomarker cyp 19 a 1 b and vtg 1, all tested estrogenic compounds altered the expression of growth- as well as isoprenoid- and cholesterol synthesis related genes, suggesting a possible marker function for these genes. Linuron and prochloraz induced neuroendocrine pathways similar to flutamide, suggesting that the altered expression of neuroendocrine genes exerts a possible marker function for anti-androgenic mechanisms. Since only little information is available on the impact of anti-androgens on neurotransmitter activity in fish, these data provide new insights into the mechanisms of anti-androgens in fish. However, no individual marker genes could be identified for the anti-androgenic compounds, which indicated a weak gene response to anti-androgens in 48 hpf embryos. Thus, the expression of known endocrine marker and androgen signaling related genes in response to flutamide was examined in 48 hpf embryos and 96 hpf embryos, in order to test whether a more defined anti-androgenic response can be retrieved in a later developmental stage. Indeed, the regulation of important endocrine genes was detected after 96 h exposure to flutamide in zebrafish, favouring the use of 96 hpf zebrafish embryos compared to 48 hpf embryos for testing anti-androgenic disruption. Next, the zebrafish results were compared to medaka. The response to the tested estrogens in medaka was in line with the corresponding gene response in zebrafish and only the regulation of the steroid receptors was different. This, on the one hand, introduced medaka as a suitable species for testing estrogenic disruption, equally to zebrafish, and on the other hand, confirmed the marker function of the tested genes. Further, the response to EE 2 and flutamide was also discernible in medaka embryos, implying that the assessment of different mode of actions is possible in both fish species. The main difference between both species was the response to flutamide: Though the same genes were affected, their regulation was contrary. Further, the downregulation of anti-androgenic marker was unique to medaka. Thus, the use of both fish species elicited inter-species variations in the response to flutamide, implying the complementarity of the use of both fish species. Conclusively, this thesis proves the suitability of medaka and zebrafish embryos for endocrine disruption testing and provides a valuable basis for {{the development and implementation of}} a transcriptomics based FET approach, which would allow rapid, animal-test free and cost-effective testing for endocrine disruption...|$|E
40|$|The aquatic {{environment}} receives many chemical substances of natural or anthropogenic origin, which {{can influence the}} endocrine functions and health of wildlife. Various examples of endocrine disruption in wildlife were documented in aquatic organisms, for which associations between reproductive and developmental effects and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been demonstrated. Since most of the endocrine-disrupting effects reported {{appear to be a}} consequence of feminization of males, most ecotoxicological research has been directed to identify estrogenic chemicals. However, the endocrine-disrupting effects exerted by EDCs can result from different mechanisms such as agonism or antagonism of endogenous steroid hormones via interaction with steroid hormone-receptors, or interference with the sex steroid hormone synthesis. Given the potential threat of these EDCs for wildlife, effective testing methods are required by regulatory agencies and industry to identify and assess the different mechanisms of action by which the EDCs exert their adverse effects. Testing strategies for endocrine disruption are being developed, in particular with fish test assays. These strategies are based on tiered approach, starting with fish in vitro and in vivo screening assays that identify and inform on potential endocrine mechanisms and effects. The results of the screening assays have then to be confirmed by higher tiered fish in vivo assays that characterize any apical adverse effect resulting from <b>endocrine</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Although the assays to screen for chemicals interacting with sex steroid receptor are widely available, tests to identify and inform on effects of chemicals that act via disrupting sex steroid biosynthesis still need to be developed. The aim of this thesis was therefore to develop and evaluate the potential of different fish test methods focused on chemicals that may interfere with the sex steroid biosynthesis. In a first step, an ex vivo gonad assay from juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) was developed to specifically identify substances that disrupt the activity of enzymes involved in the sex steroid biosynthesis. The ex vivo gonad assay was applied to test model chemicals, known or suspected to inhibit sex steroid biosynthesis: 1, 4, 6 -androstatriene- 3, 17 -dione (ATD), an aromatase inhibitor pharmaceutical; prochloraz, an imidazole fungicide; tributyltin (TBT), an organotin compound and persistent organic pollutant. Their effects in the ex vivo gonad assay were assessed by measuring 17 ß-estradiol and testosterone concentrations from the culture medium. The different profile of sex steroid concentrations obtained for each chemical exposure showed that the ex vivo gonad assay cannot only identify the chemicals disrupting the steroidogenesis, but has also the potential to inform on their specific mechanism of action. To further evaluate the ex vivo gonad assay and its potential to inform on in vivo effects, the responses to prochloraz and TBT exposure were compared in the ex vivo and in vivo exposure assays of juvenile brown trout. The effects were again assessed by measuring 17 ß-estradiol and testosterone concentrations, and also by analyzing somatic indices and histopathology of gonads from fish exposed in vivo to the test chemicals. The results of this study demonstrated that the ex vivo gonad assay has the potential to inform on in vivo effects of chemicals disrupting the steroidogenesis and accordingly on their potential to affect sexual development of fish. This study highlights the potential of the ex vivo gonad assay to be a sensitive and informative tool for such EDCs. The ex vivo gonad assay was then used to further analyze the potential of the steroidogenic inhibitors to impair the regulation of early sexual development of fish. This was investigated by comparing cellular and molecular effects of ex vivo and in vivo exposures to ATD, prochloraz and TBT. The ex vivo 17 ß-estradiol and testosterone concentrations were measured and ex vivo/in vivo gene expression of the aromatase and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), involved in the regulation of sexual development, were compared. It was shown that the test chemicals could interfere with both the sex steroid and IGF systems and potentially lead to altered sexual development. Finally, to confirm the potential of steroidogenic inhibitors to impair sex differentiation and development, a higher tier fish in vivo test, a Fish Sexual Development Test (FSDT), was applied. Two model fish species, zebrafish (Danio rerio) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) were exposed, from embryo to sexual maturity, to prochloraz and the effects on their sexual differentiation were compared by assessing the sex ratios, the histology of gonads, and the vitellogenin concentration. The results of this last study demonstrated that, although the different strategies of sexual differentiation of zebrafish and fathead minnow influence the response of their gonad morphology and their sensitivity to prochloraz exposure, the exposure to steroidogenic inhibitors has the potential to alter their sexual development and subsequently the reproductive success and population structure of fish. To conclude, we suggest that the evaluation of the ex vivo and in vivo methods in our different studies are sensitive and valuable tools for application in environmental risk assessment of chemicals interfering with the sex steroid biosynthesis. Although further characterization and validation studies of the ex vivo gonad and FSDT assays are still required, the combination of both ex vivo and in vivo assays represents a good testing approach...|$|E

The most sensitive exposure period for interactions with the estrogen receptor (ER) is the sexual development phase. The most sensitive manifestation endpoint is the reduction of the fertilization rate, the sensitivity of juvenile growth and sex manifestation being very close. The vitellogenin (VTG) measurement in a FSA is comparably sensitive. When using it as a lower tier test, a false negative result is not expected. Androgen receptor-(AR-) interactions have to be differentiated in the agonistic and antagonistic MoA. For both, VTG is not always a powerful biomarker. Fecundity is the most sensitive population relevant endpoint for the investigated AR antagonist; the most sensitive indicative endpoint in the FSA and the two-generation test is the enhanced sexual steroid 11 -ketotestosterone. Regarding the AR agonists, sexual development is the most sensitive exposure period, the sex ratio being the most sensitive endpoint. Sufficiently sensitive biomarkers were not identified. Sexual development is also the most sensitive exposure period for aromatase inhibitors, becoming manifest in different endpoints with close sensitivity: the shift towards males in sex ratio, growth retardation or fecundity. VTG reduction was sensitive in the definitive tests {{as well as in the}} FSA. The investigated fish species were principally comparably sensitive towards hormone receptor interaction. The manifestation of effects may differ, i. e., in Medaka and Fathead Minnow, ER agonists cause femalization, whereas Zebrafish are arrested in their male protogyne development phase; zebrafish seem to be more sensitive to masculinisation by aromatase inhibition, whereas Fathead minnow seems to be more sensitive in a reduction of juvenile growth. Whether a two-generation test should be performed instead of a FLCT depends on the relevance of maternal effect transfer and could not be clarified due to a lack of comparable data. For using a shortened test procedure instead of a FLCT or two-generation test, precise information about the MoA is necessary as well as evidence on whether the shortened protocol is appropriate to cover the most sensitive exposure period and the most sensitive population relevant endpoint. Partial life cycle tests, such as short-term reproduction tests, thus can never be appropriate. The Fish Sexual Development Test (FSDT) could be the adequate test for AR agonists and aromatase inhibitors. The Early Life Stage or Juvenile Growth Test can be used for DMI-fungicides for a sufficiently safe extrapolation to FLCT results to perform a preliminary regulatory risk assessment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Endocrine {{disruptor}} chemicals elicit {{adverse health}} effects by perturbing nuclear receptor signalling systems. It has been speculated that these compounds may also perturb epigenetic mechanisms and thus contribute to the early origin of adult onset disease. We hypothesised that histone methylation may be {{a component of the}} epigenome that is susceptible to perturbation. We used coexpression analysis of publicly available data to investigate the combinatorial <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> nuclear receptors and genes involved in histone methylation in normal testis and when faced with endocrine disruptor compounds. Methodology/Principal Findings: The expression patterns of a set of genes were profiled across testis tissue in human, rat and mouse, plus control and exposed samples from four toxicity experiments in the rat. Our results indicate that histone methylation events are a more general component of nuclear receptor mediated transcriptional regulation in the testis than previously appreciated. Coexpression patterns support the role of a gatekeeper mechanism involving the histone methylation modifiers Kdm 1, Prdm 2, and Ehmt 1 and indicate that this mechanism is a common determinant of transcriptional integrity for genes critical to diverse physiological endpoints relevant to endocrine disruption. Coexpression patterns following exposure to vinclozolin and dibutyl phthalate suggest that coactivity of the demethylase Kdm 1 in particular warrants further investigation in relation to <b>endocrine</b> disruptor <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Conclusions/Significance: This study provides proof of concept that a bioinformatics approach that profiles genes related to a specific hypothesis across multiple biological settings can provide powerful insight into coregulatory activity that would be difficult to discern at an individual experiment level or by traditional differential expression analysis methods...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) {{is a rare}} {{lung disease}} caused by {{mutations}} in the tumor suppressor genes encoding Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) 1 and TSC 2. The protein product of the TSC 2 gene is a well-known suppressor of the mTOR pathway. Emerging {{evidence suggests that the}} pituitary hormone prolactin (Prl) has both <b>endocrine</b> and paracrine <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Here, we have investigated components of the Prl system in models for LAM. In a TSC 2 (+/-) mouse sarcoma cell line, down-regulation of TSC 2 using siRNA resulted in increased levels of the Prl receptor. In human LAM cells, the Prl receptor is detectable by immunohistochemistry, and the expression of Prl in these cells stimulates STAT 3 and Erk phosphorylation, as well as proliferation. A high affinity Prl receptor antagonist consisting of Prl with four amino acid substitutions reduced phosphorylation of STAT 3 and Erk. Antagonist treatment further reduced the proliferative and invasive properties of LAM cells. In histological sections from LAM patients, Prl receptor immuno reactivity was observed. We conclude that the Prl receptor is expressed in LAM, and that loss of TSC 2 increases Prl receptor levels. It is proposed that Prl exerts growth-stimulatory effects on LAM cells, and that antagonizing the Prl receptor can block such effects...|$|R
40|$|The veitebrate {{body has}} at its {{disposal}} three different systems, which together help it to maintain homeostasis and to respond to environmental signals: the nervous system. the endocrine system and the immune system. Traditionally, these systems have been studied as separate entities. However, {{in the interest of}} stability of the organism, it is essential that these different systems be able to communicate and reciprocally regulate each other's activities [I]. Communication can take place via direct cell-cell contact or through soluble signalling molecules and their specific receptors on target cells. It is hypothesised that the signalling molecules, which are shared between the three systems, are evolutionarily ancient [2]. Among others, endorphins [3, 4], cytokines such as interleukin-l (IL-l) and IL- 6 [5 - 7], honnones such as corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) [8, 9] and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) [3, 4] and neuropeptides such as substance P and somatostatin [2, to] have been identified as signalling molecules with effects on many different cell types and effector systems. Through its effects on vasodilatation and blood flow the nervous system can modulate the local immune microenvironment in any tissue. All specialised lymphoid tissues are densely innervated by neurons of the sympathetic nervous system and by sensory neurons containing peptide neurotransmitters. Hormones with an <b>endocrine</b> or paracrine <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> also modulate the tissue microenvironment [11, 12].

30|$|Because {{extensive}} {{information regarding}} both pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics {{is needed to}} actually judge the similarity <b>of</b> the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> two or more chemicals [23], the preference of IA above CA based on the known or assumed <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> has been questioned [23 – 26]. The classification of similar and dissimilar <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> as applied {{in the present study}} relates to the pesticidal <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> the a.s., hence to the specific toxicity towards the target organisms based on the known molecular target and the development of cross-resistances in target organisms. No difference in the frequency distribution of MDR values was found between products with similarly and dissimilarly acting a.s. based on this pesticidal mode-of-action classification. Although the low percentage of products that contained a.s. with similar pesticidal <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> among the investigated products may have limited the ability to detect systematic differences, the absence of differences indicates that the here assumed dissimilarity <b>of</b> the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> did overall not interfere with the applicability of CA. The available information about the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> pesticidal a.s. in non-target organisms is generally limited and thereby hardly supporting a sound decision about the choice between IA and CA. Toxicity may be imposed by the same <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> particularly when the targeted molecules mediate identical functions in the target organisms and the species used in the ecotoxicological testing, e.g., photosynthesis in weeds as target organisms of herbicides and algae or higher aquatic plants as non-target organisms. For other pesticidal a.s., the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> may differ between target and non-target organisms. Baseline toxicity (narcosis), i.e., a similar <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> is often assumed in the absence of documented specific toxicity, as for example regarding the toxicity of photosynthesis inhibitors towards heterotrophic organisms [8, 14]. Another example are de-methylation inhibitors (DMI fungicides, FRAC group G 1) that are designed to interfere with cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases in target fungi but can affect diverse and different biochemical pathways in various species and thereby display different <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> in non-target organisms [27]. These authors reported that in Daphnia magna, DMI fungicides from four different chemical classes were found to exhibit baseline toxicity as well as specific toxicity. The latter differed among substances, i.e., fenarimol and triadimefon affected embryonic eye development while pyrifenox affected molting [27]. Likewise, Ankley et al. [28] reported multiple <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> the DMI fungicides prochloraz and fenarimol in fish. A classification of the similarity <b>of</b> the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> strictly with regard to the non-target test species in question would therefore likely result in a different classification of similarity and dissimilarity for these a.s. than that solely based on the pesticidal <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> In theory, this could allow detecting a bias related to the default application of the CA concept. However, the necessary detailed information about the <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> pesticides in various non-target test species will hardly ever be available, which precludes a verification of this hypothesis.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} methods for preventing, delaying, or managing resistance is to reduce the reliance on a single herbicide <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> To do this, farmers must know the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for the herbicides they intend to use, but the relatively complex nature of plant biochemistry makes this difficult to determine. Attempts were made to simplify the understanding <b>of</b> herbicide <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> by developing a classification system that grouped herbicides by <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Eventually the Herbicide Resistance Action Committee (HRAC) and the Weed Science Society of America (WSSA) developed a classification system.

The goal for adding the “Group” classification and <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> to the herbicide product label is to provide a simple and practical approach to deliver the information to users.

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate associations between family planning counselling, counsellor and correct knowledge about <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> modern contraceptive methods among married women. Methods For this cross-sectional study, stratified (according to current modern contraceptive method in use) random sampling was performed from the registries of two primary health care centres. Main outcomes were; prevalence of family planning counselling, professional background of the counsellor and correct knowledge about <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> A semi-structured questionnaire developed by the researchers was applied via face-to-face interview. The answers about <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> were categorized as correct vs. incorrect by consensus rating. Results Prevalence of counselling and correct knowledge about <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> was 49. 0 % and 39. 3 %, respectively. Higher educated women were significantly more likely to know the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> (p p = 0. 79). Non-barrier method users were less educated (p = 0. 001), more often counselled (60. 8 % vs. 8. 0 %) and less knowledgeable (p p = 0. 021) than counselled condom users. Conclusion The beneficial effect of counselling on knowledge about <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> the more complicated, medical (non-barrier) contraceptive methods suggests that the use of family planning counselling services in primary health care should be promoted; furthermore, counselling strategies and content should be re-structured for better efficacy. </p...|$|R

30|$|The <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> a {{biopesticide}} is {{a critical}} component in commercial success. It determines efficacy of pest control, efficiency of use, consistency of response, host target and nontarget susceptibility. <b>Mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> also impacts the choice of manufacturing method and the final cost of production. Typically, there are three broad <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for microbial biopesticides: i) biological or ecological <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> ii) physical means, or iii) chemical or biochemical processes. Biological <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> can include predation or competition. Physical control may involve creating barriers or occupying space. Chemical or biochemical approaches disrupt biochemical, genetic or structural function in the targeted pest. Glare et al. [5] reported that more successful biopesticides utilize compounds that are produced by the microorganism, rather than relying only on the infection process. Glare et al. [5] gives examples such as B. thuringiensis and B. subtilis, which produce toxic proteins and agrastatins, respectively. The production of these compounds has been optimized through fermentation. Biopesticides that utilize secondary metabolites may be more akin to synthetic pesticides. However biopesticides utilize multiple <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> greatly {{reducing the risk of}} resistance developing. For example, a single biopesticide may produce more than one secondary compound [10] that works synergistically with the physiological interaction of the microbe with the host.
