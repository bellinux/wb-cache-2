30|$|Various {{synchronization}} {{techniques for}} orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) {{systems have been}} developed using well-designed preambles[5 – 14]. Although accurate timing estimation can be achieved, the bandwidth efficiency is also inevitably reduced. In {{order to reduce the}} waste of bandwidth, non-data aided synchronization algorithms based on the cyclic prefix (CP) have been proposed[15, 16]. However, in some multipath fading channels with non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, both data-aided and non-data-aided synchronization methods frequently lead to the <b>delayed</b> <b>timing</b> in channels where the delayed path has larger gain than the first path. In this case, the resulting ICI and ISI would degrade the system performance. Also, the channel coding would not perform well because of the synchronization errors. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, a fine time adjustment is needed to modify the frequently <b>delayed</b> <b>timing</b> to the actual <b>delayed</b> <b>timing</b> in channels. In[15], the proposed timing estimator performs well only for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. While the system operates in the multipath fading channels, the proposed algorithm exhibits significantly large fluctuation in the estimated timing offset. In[16], the modified blind timing synchronization method has a good performance in the multipath fading channels with line-of-sight (LOS) propagation only when the SNR is greater than 20 dB. In[14], a well-designed time-domain training sequence is utilized to perform joint timing synchronization and channel estimation. Although the proposed timing estimator has excellent performance at low SNR[14], the power consumption of the proposed preamble is still too large to be adopted in some low-power wireless applications.|$|E

40|$|The {{complexity}} of {{software running on}} vehicular embedded systems is constantly increasing and this negatively affects its development costs and time to market. One {{way to deal with}} these issues is to boost abstraction in the form of models to (i) ease the reasoning about the system architecture, (ii) automate certain stages of the development, (iii) early detect flaws in the system architecture through fundamental analysis and (iv) take appropriate countermeasures before the system is implemented. Considering the importance of timing requirements in the design of software for vehicular embedded systems, in this licentiate thesis we leverage Model-Driven Engineering for realizing a semi-automatic approach which allows the developer to perform end-to-end <b>delay</b> <b>timing</b> analysis on design models, without having to manually model timing elements and set their values. The proposed approach, starting from a design model of an automotive software functionality, automatically generates a set of models enriched with timing elements whose values are set at generation time. End-to-end <b>delay</b> <b>timing</b> analysis is run on the generated models and, based on the analysis results, the approach automatically selects the generated models which better meet a specific set of timing requirements...|$|R

30|$|In this article, {{we propose}} unit vectors {{in the high}} {{dimensional}} Cartesian coordinate system as the preamble, and then propose a semiblind timing synchronization and channel estimation scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Due {{to the lack of}} useful information in the time-domain, a frequency-domain timing synchronization algorithm is proposed. The proposed semiblind approach consists of three stages. In the first stage, a coarse timing offset related to the <b>delayed</b> <b>timing</b> of the path with the maximum gain in multipath fading channels is obtained. Then, a fine time adjustment algorithm is performed to find the actual <b>delayed</b> <b>timing</b> in channels. Finally, the channel response in the frequency-domain is obtained based on the final timing estimate. Although the required number of additions in the proposed algorithm is higher than those in conventional methods, the simulation results show that the proposed approach has excellent performance of timing synchronization in several channel models at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) smaller than 6 dB. In addition, for a low-density parity-check coded single-input single-output OFDM system, our proposed approach has better bit-error-rate performance than conventional approaches for SNR varying from 3 to 8 dB.|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Young birds often reproduce {{later in}} the season than older ones, with poorer breeding success, but the proximate mechanisms involved in such a pattern remain poorly studied, especially in long-lived species. One possible mechanism is the endocrine stress response which is accompanied by the release of corticosterone. Elevated corticosterone levels can trigger physiological and behavioural responses that may delay or even suppress reproduction. 2. We tested the hypothesis that the <b>delayed</b> <b>timing</b> of breeding of young birds may be related to a greater susceptibility to stress compared with older ones during the pre-laying period of the breeding season. For this purpose, known-age (7 – 44 years old) pre-laying snow petrels, Pagodroma nivea, were monitored for baseline and acute stress-induced corticosterone levels. We examined whether baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels were related to age, and whether they could influence the decision to breed and egg-laying date. 3. Young snow petrels were more likely to skip the breeding season and to breed later than middle-aged birds. In addition, the oldest birds bred later than middle-aged ones, suggesting a possible senescence on laying dates. Baseline corticosterone levels were independent of age but young and very old birds were more sensitive to stress than middle-aged ones. However, there was no effect of stress-induced corticosterone levels on breeding decision and egg-laying date. Elevated baseline corticosterone levels during the pre-laying period were associated with a higher probability of skipping breeding in females and a <b>delayed</b> <b>timing</b> of egg-laying in both sexes. 4. These results suggest that the greater susceptibility of young breeders to stress was not the functional mechanism explaining their <b>delayed</b> <b>timing</b> of breeding. Baseline corticosterone levels, although independent of age, appear to be a more likely mediator of breeding decision and egglaying date. In long-lived birds, the relationship between age and timing of breeding may be rather indirect, as other age-related factors such as breeding experience or foraging skills may have a deeper impact on baseline corticosterone than age per se...|$|E

40|$|The need {{to provide}} {{engineering}} solutions to full scale blasting problems has driven the development of several empirically based fragmentation models. Arguably, {{the most popular and}} successful models have been those applicable to surface blasting such as the Kuz-Ram model; and more recently the KCO model applying the Swebrec function. These models are based on what is generally described as the fragmentation associated with single hole firing conditions, that is, they do not consider the potential interaction of detonating blastholes on the breakage and fragmentation process. The application of precise and short <b>delay</b> <b>timing</b> using electronic detonators has demonstrated the need to incorporate modelling parameters that can adequately show the impact of timing on fragmentation. This paper describes an approach based on the hypothesis that a correction factor {{can be applied to the}} uniformity of fragmentation, the expected mean size of fragments and the proportion of fines generated during the blasting process. The correction factor is a function of the ratio between the interhole delay time dt and the minimum response time Tmin, which is defined as the time that elapses between explosive detonation and rock mass movement and is a function of explosive type, rock properties and blast design parameters. The use of this correction factor to predict relative changes in fragmentation from changes in interhole <b>delay</b> <b>timing</b> is demonstrated using a newly proposed two component Swebrec function. Preliminary data analysis demonstrates the practicality of the method. As with any empirical methodology, site specific calibration and further testing is recommended...|$|R
