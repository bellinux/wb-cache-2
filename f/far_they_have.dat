5|$|Negron, in a {{flashback}} tells of his war {{experiences as a}} young corporal of the segregated 92nd Infantry Division in Italy in 1944. A disastrous attack ensues on German positions across the Serchio River. An officer, Captain Nokes, calls down artillery on the 92nd's own position, refusing to believe their reports of how <b>far</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> advanced. Many American soldiers are killed, leaving Negron stranded {{on the wrong side}} of the river with three men: Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps, Sergeant Bishop Cummings, and Private Sam Train. Sam carries the Head of the Primavera that he found in Florence, which he believes to carry magical powers. Sam and Bishop rescue an Italian boy named Angelo from a collapsing building. While traveling through the mountains of Tuscany, the soldiers enter a small village, where they form a bond with the residents. Sam grows especially fond of Angelo, becoming the boy's father figure. One Italian villager, Renata, soon becomes entangled in a love triangle with Stamps and Bishop, which creates conflict.|$|E
2500|$|British geologists have {{developed}} a method of predicting future eruptions of Mt. Etna. [...] They have discovered {{that there is a}} time lag of 25 years between events. Monitoring of deep crust events can help predict accurately what will happen in the years to come. [...] So <b>far</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> predicted that between 2007 and 2015, volcanic activity will be half of what it was in 1972.|$|E

She could have been very useful to them simply for her understanding of the U.S." ...|$|E

2500|$|Myatt is also {{alleged to}} have been the founder of the occult group the Order of Nine Angles (ONA/O9A) or to have taken it over, written the {{publicly}} available teachings of the ONA under the pseudonym Anton Long, with his role being [...] "paramount to the whole creation and existence of the ONA". According to Senholt, [...] "ONA-inspired activities, led by protagonist David Myatt, managed to enter the scene of grand politics and the global 'War On Terror', because of several foiled terror plots in Europe that can be linked to Myatt's writings". David Myatt has always denied such allegations about involvement with the ONA, and using the pseudonym Anton Long. and has repeatedly challenged his accusers to provide evidence of such allegations, which so <b>far</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> failed to do.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{of their}} small {{size and the}} {{difficulty}} of crystallizing integral membrane proteins for X-ray analysis, it is only very recently that scientists have been able to directly examine what channels [...] "look like." [...] Particularly in cases where the crystallography required removing channels from their membranes with detergent, many researchers regard images that have been obtained as tentative. An example is the long-awaited crystal structure of a voltage-gated potassium channel, which was reported in May 2003. One inevitable ambiguity about these structures relates to the strong evidence that channels change conformation as they operate (they open and close, for example), such that the structure in the crystal could represent any one of these operational states. Most of what researchers have deduced about channel operation so <b>far</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> established through electrophysiology, biochemistry, gene sequence comparison and mutagenesis.|$|E
2500|$|Conservationists {{have fought}} {{to save the}} estate from demolition, which they claim is a unique {{surviving}} example of twentieth-century architecture. [...] Thus <b>far</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> succeeded in seeing Grade II listing applied by English Heritage to six buildings on the estate including St. Mark's Church. [...] The conservation of the estate has been spearheaded by the Twentieth Century Society; claiming that the overall layout and planning of the estate is key to its uniqueness and that just keeping six buildings and surrounding them with new houses does not suffice. [...] Despite the Twentieth Century Society campaigning for the entire estate to be made a conservation area and English Heritage recommending 21 buildings be listed, the Department for Culture would {{only go so far}} as to list six of the buildings. [...] Under listing guidelines for twentieth-century buildings, only buildings with few moderations should be listed; in the case of Excalibur, most buildings have modified windows and doors. [...] A prominent local resident favouring conservation stated: [...] "The Excalibur Prefab Estate is the largest of its kind now left in Europe. Europe values its war time history, we on the estate think it’s time we did too." [...] Emily Gee of English Heritage said of the estate: [...] "The historical resonance of the estate is considerable. The design of the buildings, with their subtle modern influences, and the community-focused planning of the estate testifies to the thoughtfulness of post-Blitz reconstruction." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{neighboring}} {{communities of}} Bensenville and Elk Grove Village have been centers {{of resistance to}} the expansion plan, due to their proximity to the airport and because some of their residents and businesses would be required to relocate. Bensenville and Elk Grove Village formed the Suburban O'Hare Commission to fight the expansion. So <b>far,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not had much success. The commission did receive a temporary injunction against portions of the city's expansion project; it was soon overturned, however. The Suburban O'Hare Commission has also been instrumental in pushing for a third regional airport in south suburban Peotone, which it claims would alleviate congestion at O'Hare. No airline has committed to the proposed airport, however, and planning efforts moved very slowly during 2007–08. In 2008, Elk Grove Village ended resistance. They received assurance that a proposed highway would not be built through their business park. In November 2009, Bensenville officially ended all resistance to the expansion, ceasing all legal challenges against the city of Chicago. They received a one-time $16-million payment from Chicago. The city of Chicago also faced a five-year court battle to acquire a small, historical cemetery located within the space of their planned runway expansion. A settlement was finally reached in December 2012, between St. John United Church of Christ in Bensenville and the city of Chicago. The city agreed to pay the church $1.3 million for the [...] parcel {{on the west side of}} the airport, which included a [...] burial ground established by the church in 1849. All told, 1,494 bodies were disinterred from the St. Johannes Cemetery and reburied at various cemeteries throughout the region.|$|E

6000|$|The {{crowning}} {{glory of}} loving and being loved {{is that the}} pair make no real progress; however <b>far</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> advanced into the enchanted land during the day, they must start again from the frontier next morning.

In every church here prayers are offered {{for the success of}} the champion of Protestantism; and I am sure that if he had sent Scottish officers, as Gustavus Adolphus did, to raise troops in Scotland, he could have obtained forty or fifty thousand men in a very few weeks, so excited is everyone over the struggle.|$|E
