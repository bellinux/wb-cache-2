5|$|The {{subjective}} test was rejected {{for several reasons}} by the Court of Appeal. It held that applying the {{subjective test}} to sections 8 and 10 of the ISA would render the provisions unconstitutional. The word law in Article 12(1) of the Constitution was held in Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980) to encompass fundamental rules of natural justice. Hence, Parliament cannot pass legislation which authorizes the executive to <b>exercise</b> <b>power</b> in breach of these fundamental rules or to <b>exercise</b> <b>power</b> in an arbitrary manner. If the subjective test were to be adopted, it would in effect allow the executive to exercise arbitrary powers of detention, therefore rendering sections8 and 10 of the ISA inconsistent with Article12(1). When the case was decided, Article149(1) of the Constitution, which protects the validity of anti-subversion laws notwithstanding inconsistencies with specified fundamental liberties, did not cover inconsistencies with Article12. Also, the Court noted that adopting the objective test {{would be consistent with}} Article93 of the Constitution, which vests judicial power in the courts. It did not, however, directly address the argument by counsel that the subjective test, in conferring arbitrary powers of detention, would be inconsistent with Article93.|$|E
5|$|In a {{supplementary}} OKW order dated 10 September 1943, Hitler decrees on {{the establishment}} of further Operational Zones in Northern Italy, which were the stretch {{all the way to}} the French border. Unlike Alpenvorland and Küstenland, these zones did not immediately receive high commissioners (oberster kommissar) as civilian advisors, but were military regions where the commander was to <b>exercise</b> <b>power</b> on behalf of Army Group B. Operation zone Nordwest-Alpen or Schweizer Grenze was located between the Stelvio Pass and Monte Rosa and was to contain wholly the Italian provinces of Sondrio and Como and parts of the provinces of Brescia, Varese, Novara and Vercelli. The zone of Französische Grenze was to encompass areas west of Monte Rosa and was to incorporate the province of Aosta and a part of the province of Turin, and presumably also the provinces of Cuneo and Imperia.|$|E
5|$|An error as to a {{precedent}} fact, if committed, deprives the public authority {{of power to}} take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, {{as the case may}} be, is a condition precedent or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in the}} United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not <b>exercise</b> <b>power</b> to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was {{a precedent}} fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E

5|$|The 14th {{century in}} England saw the Great Famine and the Black Death, catastrophic events that killed around half of England's population, {{throwing}} the economy into chaos and undermining the old political order. Social unrest followed, {{resulting in the}} Peasants' Revolt of 1381, while {{the changes in the}} economy resulted in {{the emergence of a new}} class of gentry, and the nobility began to <b>exercise</b> <b>power</b> through a system termed bastard feudalism. Nearly 1,500 villages were deserted by their inhabitants and many men and women sought new opportunities in the towns and cities. New technologies were introduced, and England produced some of the great medieval philosophers and natural scientists. English kings in the 14th and 15th centuries laid claim to the French throne, resulting in the Hundred Years' War. At times England enjoyed huge military success, with the economy buoyed by profits from the international wool and cloth trade, but by 1450 the country was in crisis, facing military failure in France and an ongoing recession. More social unrest broke out, followed by the Wars of the Roses, fought between rival factions of the English nobility. Henry VII's victory in 1485 conventionally marks the end of the Middle Ages in England and the start of the Early Modern period.|$|E

25|$|On , the Cortes met in Lisbon and decreed the {{formation}} of a Council of Regency to <b>exercise</b> <b>power</b> in the name of King John. It freed many political prisoners and demanded the king's immediate return. On 20 April, King John convoked a meeting in Rio to choose deputies to the Constituent Cortes, but the following day, protests in the plaza were put down violently. In Brazil, the general opinion was that the king's return to Portugal could mean loss of the autonomy Brazil had gained and a return to its prior colonial status. Under pressure, John tried to find a middle way by sending his son Prince Pedro to Lisbon to grant a constitution and establish the basis of a new government. The prince, however, already leaning toward liberal ideas, refused. The crisis had gone too far and there was no turning back. John named Pedro regent for Brazil in his name and left for Lisbon on 25 April 1821 after a stay of thirteen years in Brazil, a country he would always miss.|$|E

The objective of the amending legislation was to protect the interests of mortgagors by strengthening the statutory provisions relating to {{the duty of the}} mortgagee <b>exercising</b> <b>power</b> of sale to take reasonable care to ensure the property is sold at market value.

25|$|The {{town was}} a fort of the {{independent}} local Thracian tribe Bessi. In 516 BC during the rule of Darius the Great, Thrace {{was included in the}} Persian empire. In 492 BC the Persian general Mardonius subjected Thrace again, and it became nominally a vassal of Persia until 479 BC and the early rule of Xerxes I. The town was included in the Odrysian kingdom (460 BC-46 AD), a Thracian tribal union. The town was conquered by Philip II of Macedon and the Odrysian king was deposed in 342 BC. Ten years after the Macedonian invasion the Thracian kings started to <b>exercise</b> <b>power</b> again after the Odrysian Seuthes III had re-established their kingdom under Macedonian suzerainty {{as a result of a}} somehow successful revolt against Alexander the Great's rule resulting in neither victory, nor defeat, but stalemate. The Odrysian kingdom gradually overcome the Macedonian suzerainty, while the city was destroyed by the Celts as part of the Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe, most likely in the 270s BC. In 183 BC Philip V of Macedon conquered the city, but shortly after the Thracians re-conquered it.|$|E

500|$|To {{understand}} how organisations operate, Russell explains, {{we must first}} understand the basic methods by which they can <b>exercise</b> <b>power</b> at all — that is, we must understand {{the manner in which}} individuals are persuaded to follow some authority. Russell breaks the forms of influence down into three very general categories: [...] "the power of force and coercion"; the [...] "power of inducements", such as operant conditioning and group conformity; and [...] "the power of propaganda and/or habit" [...] (Russell 1938:24).|$|E
500|$|Regarding Austen's {{views of}} society and economics, Alastair MacIntyre in his 1981 After Virtue offered a {{critique}} of the Enlightenment as leading to moral chaos and decay, and citing Aristotle argued that a [...] "good life for man" [...] is only possible if one follows the traditional moral rules of one's society. In this regard, MacIntrye used Austen as an [...] "Aristotelian" [...] writer whose books offered up examples of how to be virtuous with the English country estate playing the same role that the polis did for Aristotle. By contrast, Mary Evans in her 1987 book Jane Austen and the State depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist concerned with the [...] "stability of human relationships and communities" [...] and against [...] "conspicuous consumption" [...] and the [...] "individualisation of feeling" [...] promoted by the Industrial Revolution. In her 1987 book Desire and Domestic Fiction, Nancy Armstrong in a study much influenced by the theories of Karl Marx and Michel Foucault, argued that all of Austen's books reflected the dominant political-economic ideology of her times, concerning the battle to <b>exercise</b> <b>power</b> over the human body, which determined how and whether a woman was considered sexually desirable or not. The Marxist James Thompson in his 1988 book Between Self and the World likewise depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist searching for a realm of freedom and feeling in a world dominated by a soulless materialism promoted by capitalism. By contrast, David Kaufmann in his 1992 essay [...] "Propriety and the Law" [...] argued that Austen was a classical liberal in the mold of Adam Smith, who felt that virtue was best exercised in the private sphere of the family life rather in the public sphere of politics. Kaufmann rejected the claim that Austen was influenced by Edmund Burke, arguing that for Austen, virtue was not something passed down from time immemorial from a landed elite as Burke would have it, but rather was something that any individual could acquire, thus making Austen into something of a radical. As Rajeswari Rajan notes in her essay on recent Austen scholarship, [...] "the idea of a political Austen is no longer seriously challenged". The questions scholars now investigate involve: [...] "the [...] Revolution, war, nationalism, empire, class, 'improvement' , the clergy, town versus country, abolition, the professions, female emancipation; whether her politics were Tory, Whig, or radical; whether she was a conservative or a revolutionary, or occupied a reformist position between these extremes".|$|E
