40|$|The {{microstructure}} and adherence of {{vitreous enamel}} to {{low carbon steel}} substrate with different compositions were evaluated by using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and the bending test method. The condition of the bubbles, the <b>fish-scaling</b> resistance, and the adherence strength were also analysed by microscopic methods. The {{results show that the}} microstructures of the enamel layers are similar for the two steels, while the addition of titanium and vanadium to the steel degrades the adherence. The mechanism of enamel-steel interface adherence could be explained as mainly mechanical interlocking, chemical bonding subsequent to a series of chemical reactions. Fe-rich dendrites can only be found in the bubbles located inside the interface transit zone...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{effective}} fishscaler {{has been developed}} by the FAO/DANIDA Training Project On Fish Technology. Serrated bottle caps (i. e. beer or mineral water type) are loosely nailed to allow rotation {{on a piece of}} wood shaped like a square bat. The wooden base is made from clean hardwood, coated with either food-grade plastic resin or with a paint that is safe to be in contact with food. The bottle caps are stripped of any paper, plastic or rubber seal and glue. Usually <b>fish-scaling</b> is earned out using the back of a knife, but the cap scaler has been found to cause less damage to the skin of the fish. The fish is held firmly by the tail and the scaler is moved from the tail {{to the head of the}} fish, firmly but gently. Because of the greater area covered by the scaler compared to a knife, the scaling process is quicker to carry out. The configuration of the caps can be varied in order to adapt the scaler to different types of fish. The scaler has other useful applications such as removing small feathers from poultry. However, a scaler used on poultry should not then be used on fish as this could cause cross-contamination by bacteria such as Salmonella. All scalers should be thoroughly cleaned after use with a brush in chlorinated or soapy water or with other appropriate cleaning agents.

40|$|We show in {{this paper}} that the {{bottom-up}} approach to 3 D surface model reconstruction is feasible and {{may be used in}} applications requiring precision and accuracy. We focus on acquiring 3 D models of natural objects for medical applications, augmented reality, and telepresence. The reconstruction consists of several successive steps in which more complex models are inferred from simpler models. The low-level model we use is a set of unorganized points in 3 -space obtained from polynocular stereo. The intermediate-level model consists of local geometric primitives which we call <b>fish-scales.</b> <b>Fish-scales</b> are reconstructed from the unorganized point model by local PCA. The high-level model is a discrete pseudo-surface. It is reconstructed by linking together close and orientation-compatible <b>fish-scales.</b> The ungrouped isolated points and the unlinked <b>fish-scales</b> remain unexplained by the higher-level models. The approach is demonstrated on textured 3 D geometric model reconstruction of a human [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Conserving more {{soil water}} {{is of great}} {{importance}} to the sustainability of arid and semiarid orchards. Here we integrated <b>fish-scale</b> pits, semicircular mini-catchments for hill slope runoff collection, with mulches to test their effects on soil water storage in a 12 -year-old dryland jujube orchard on the Loess Plateau of China, by using soil water measurements from April  2013 to November  2014. This experiment included four treatments: <b>fish-scale</b> pits with branch mulching (FB), <b>fish-scale</b> pits with straw mulching (FS), <b>fish-scale</b> pits without mulching (F), and bare land treatment (CK). Soil water was measured using the TRIME ® -IPH time-domain reflectometer (TDR) tool in 20  cm intervals down {{to a depth of}} 180  cm, and was measured once every 2 weeks in the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons. The results showed that <b>fish-scale</b> pits with mulching were better in soil water conservation. Average soil water storage (SWS, for short) of FB at soil layer depths of 0 – 180  cm increased by 14. 23  % (2013) and 21. 81  % (2014), respectively, compared to CK, but only increased by 4. 82  % (2013) and 5. 34  % (2014), respectively, for the F treatment. The degree of soil water compensation, W S, was employed here to represent to what extent soil water was recharged from precipitation {{at the end of the}} rainy season relative to that at the beginning of the rainy season. A positive (negative) W S larger (lower) soil water content at the end of rainy season than at the beginning. For the treatment of FB, the values of W S over the entire soil profile were greater than 0; for the treatment of F, negative values of W S were observed in depths of 60 – 100  cm in both years. However, the bare land treatment showed negative values in depths of 40 – 180  cm. This indicated that integrating <b>fish-scale</b> pits with mulching could significantly increase soil water storage by increasing infiltration and decreasing evaporation, and it showed greater soil water storage and degree of soil water compensation compared to <b>fish-scale</b> pits alone. Since the branches used for mulching here were trimmed jujube branches, the cost of mulching materials was largely reduced. Therefore, integration of <b>fish-scale</b> pits with branch mulching is recommended in orchards for soil water conservation on the Loess Plateau and potentially for other regions...|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{automatic}} reconstruction of a geometric surface model of an unknown 3 D object from several 2 D images. The reconstruction task {{can be divided into}} 2 principal stages. In the 1 st stage the position of the 3 D object points is reconstructed. This recovers the dimension which was lost during the projection. The output of this stage is a set of unorganized 3 D points without a neighbourhood relation which approximate the surface. This representation is still unsufficient for measurement and visualisation. In the 2 nd reconstruction stage the global surface model is recovered. The model consists of a set of 3 D vertices and the neighbourhood relation. One way of proceeding from isolated points to the global surface is using the <b>Fish-Scale</b> Model. Every <b>fish-scale</b> can be imagined as a disk, whose principal plane approximates the surface. The <b>fish-scale</b> is reconstructed by statistical point approximation in a certain volume of space. This work focuses on the <b>fish-scale</b> model, mainly on methods of verification and refinement. The verification is a decision whether the model is or is not consistent with a given set of images. The refinement is an optimization task maximizing consistency statistics based on the re-projection of the model to images and on the calculation of image value correlation. To this end, four different types of area correlation statistics are suggested. The necessary conditions are derived that allow the verification and refinement tasks, including the minimum required number of images.

40|$|In the dryland and {{degraded}} regions, {{soil moisture}} {{is the primary}} factor determining ecological restoration. Proper land preparations and vegetation restoration can improve soil moisture and benefit land restoration. Identifying their effects on soil moisture is thus essential for developing suitable management strategies. In this study, four typical land preparation techniques (level ditches, <b>fish-scale</b> pits, zig terraces, and level benches) and non-native vegetation types (Prunus armeniaca, Platycladus orientalis, Pinus tabulaeformis, and Caragana microphylla) were planted on a semiarid loess hilly catchment, China. Soil moisture was monitored by a time-domain reflectometer, and its spatial-temporal variations were analyzed during the 2014 - 2015 growing seasons. The following results were captured. (a) Soil moisture was highest for the combination of P. orientalis and <b>fish-scale</b> pits (P. orientalis/fish-scale pits, 10. 37 %), followed by P. armeniaca/level ditches (10. 23 %), P. orientalis/zig terraces (9. 67 %), C. microphylla/level benches (8. 62 %), P. tabulaeformis/fish-scale pits (8. 05 %), and P. tabulaeformis/zig terraces (7. 72 %). (b) <b>Fish-scale</b> pits offered a better rainwater-harvesting capacity during the rainy months, whereas zig terraces had a higher water retention capacity under extremely dry conditions (as indicated by the temporal soil moisture variation and soil water retention curves). (c) P. tabulaeformis consumed more water than other vegetation types (26. 7 % {{lower than that of}} P. orientalis). (d) Soil moisture in shallower layers (0 - 80 cm) was more affected by land preparations and was more effected by vegetation types in deeper soil layers (80 - 180 cm). We thus suggest that <b>fish-scale</b> pits may be a better choice in wetter regions whereas zig terraces and P. orientalis are more suitable in the driest parts of the Loess Plateau to restore the fragile ecosystems...|$|R
