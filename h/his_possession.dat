5|$|Before the murders, Kovář's family became {{worried about}} his mental state {{to the point that}} they {{contacted}} authorities in connection with <b>his</b> <b>possession</b> of gun license. Just four days before the murders, Kovář had received a police request to present a new health clearance under the threat of revoking his license. Before entering the Družba restaurant, Kovář visited at least two other venues. Those, however, had fewer customers, and Kovář left them immediately after entering.|$|E
5|$|King Richard III's {{interest}} in heraldry was indicated by <b>his</b> <b>possession</b> of two important rolls of arms. While still Duke of Gloucester and Constable of England {{for his brother}} (Edward IV) from 1469, he in the latter capacity supervised the heralds and made plans for the reform of their organisation. Soon after his accession to the throne he created Sir John Howard as Duke of Norfolk and Earl Marshal of England, who became the first Howard appointed to both positions.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} games, Sonic collects golden rings, which {{protect him}} from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, though they will scatter and blink before disappearing. Sonic starts {{the game with a}} limited number of lives; if he is hit with no rings in <b>his</b> <b>possession,</b> he will lose a life. If a player exhausts their lives, they will receive a game over.|$|E

5|$|Suleiman secured <b>his</b> <b>possession</b> in Hungary by conquering {{several other}} forts, {{but after the}} Ottoman withdrawal, Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand I reoccupied some of the devastated territory. Following this, Suleiman and Ferdinand {{concluded}} a 1533 treaty in Constantinople that confirmed the right of John Zápolya as a king of all Hungary, but recognised Ferdinand's possession {{of some of the}} reoccupied territory.|$|E
5|$|The deputies {{turned their}} {{attention}} to Cripple Creek itself. They arrested and imprisoned hundreds of citizens without cause. Many inhabitants of the town were seized on the street or pulled from their homes, then clubbed, kicked or beaten. The deputies formed a gauntlet and forced townspeople to pass through it, spitting, slapping and kicking them. With Bull Hill in <b>his</b> <b>possession,</b> Gen. Brooks began detaining the deputies. By nightfall, Brooks had seized the town and corralled all of Bowers' men.|$|E

5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in <b>his</b> <b>possession</b> showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was stopped}} at Kőszeg {{and failed to}} conquer Vienna, Suleiman {{additionally}} secured <b>his</b> <b>possession</b> in Hungary by conquering several forts, since Ferdinand and Charles evaded an open field battle. Immediately after the Ottoman withdrawal, Ferdinand reoccupied devastated territory in Austria and Hungary. Nevertheless, Suleiman concluded a peace treaty with Ferdinand in 1533, in Constantinople. The treaty confirmed the right of John Zápolya as a king of all Hungary, but recognised Ferdinand's possession of {{that part of the}} country that enjoyed the status quo.|$|E

5|$|By 1826, {{economic}} prosperity {{was beginning to}} return to the state. The Old Court party augmented their majority in the House and gained a majority in the Senate. One legislator's proposition to resolve the controversy was to call for the resignation of the governor and lieutenant governor, the entire General Assembly, as well as the justices from both the Old and New Courts, essentially allowing the state to reset its entire government. This extreme measure was rejected. Instead, on December 29, 1826, the General Assembly repealed the reorganization act, and overrode Governor Desha's veto of the measure. They also repealed the replevin law that had touched off the controversy. On January 1, 1827, Francis Blair returned the court records in <b>his</b> <b>possession</b> to the Old Court.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{was known}} for his extravagant tastes and opulent lifestyle, as well as <b>his</b> <b>possession</b> of a large library. He had a son, Henry, {{who was one of the}} hostages demanded by Longchamp in 1190. Another son was Hugh, who became {{chancellor}} for King Philip II of France. Both Henry and Hugh were the sons of the bishop's long term mistress, Alice de Percy. Alice may have been the mother of two more of the bishop's sons, William, archdeacon of Northumberland, and Burchard, archdeacon of Durham and treasurer of York. He had a number of other mistresses but Alice was the most public, so much so that it caused a scandal, and closely resembled a marriage.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{consolidated}} much of {{his power}} in Shropshire and Herefordshire at Bridgnorth Castle, often using that site {{as a place of}} business in preference to Shrewsbury, which had previously been the main centre of business for his predecessors as sheriff. As well as Waleran, Pain imprisoned a Welsh hostage there in 1128, Llywelyn ab Owain, the nephew of Maredudd ap Bleddyn, ruler of the Welsh principality of Powys. Besides Bridgnorth, Pain used <b>his</b> <b>possession</b> of Ludlow Castle to consolidate his power in the Welsh Marches. During Henry's reign, the Welsh border was a zone of frequent raids and conflict between the Anglo-Normans and the Welsh.|$|E
5000|$|Sundarar is {{a famous}} Saivite saint and Nayanmar {{belonging}} to the 8th century. He has revered many Shiva temples in South India in his verses compiled as the Seventh Thirumurai. As per Hindu legend, while arriving at this place, he took rest in a Vinayaka temple. He presumably forgot to get thoughts about Shiva and to test his devotion, Shiva sent his Bhutaganas to steal all <b>his</b> <b>possessions.</b> Sundarar prayed to Vinayaka in the temple who showed him to proceed towards the East. Sundarar, in his anger, sang about Shiva blaming him of not protecting <b>his</b> <b>possessions.</b> Shiva graced him with his presence at this place and restored all <b>his</b> <b>possessions.</b>|$|R

5|$|Scattered {{around each}} level are gold rings. Collecting 100 rings rewards the player {{with an extra}} life. Rings act as a layer of {{protection}} against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, he will survive. However, all rings in <b>his</b> <b>possession</b> will be scattered; they flicker and disappear {{in a few seconds}} if not picked up again. If he is hit without holding any rings, he loses a life. Shields and temporary invincibility can be collected to provide additional layers of protection, but certain hazards, such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time, will cause Sonic to lose a life regardless of rings or other protection.|$|E
5|$|According to Nicol, Tagaris was {{probably}} {{born in the}} 1320s, while other sources like the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium and the Prosopographisches Lexikon der Palaiologenzeit put it later, around the year 1340. His parents arranged his marriage {{at the age of}} 14 or 15, but soon he abandoned his wife and left Constantinople to become a monk in Palestine. After a while he returned to Constantinople, where he quickly became embroiled in scandal: he claimed that an icon in <b>his</b> <b>possession</b> had miraculous properties, and made money out of gullible believers. This affair scandalized his family, but Patriarch Kallistos I declined to take action against him. It was not until the patriarch went on a visit to Serbia in July 1363 that his locum tenens, the hieromonk Dorotheos, confiscated the icon and forced Paul to return to Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Amazing {{raised its}} price from 75 cents to $1.00 with the November 1975 issue. The {{schedule}} switched to quarterly {{beginning with the}} March 1976 issue; as a result, the 50th anniversary issue had a cover date of June 1976. In 1977, Cohen announced that Amazing and Fantastic had lost $15,000, though Amazings circulation (at nearly 26,000) {{was as good as}} it had been for several years. Cohen looked for a new publisher to buy the magazines, but in September of the following year sold his half-share in the company to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. White had occasionally suggested to Cohen that Amazing would benefit from a redesign and investment; he made the same suggestions to Bernhard in early October. According to White, Bernhard not only said no, but told him he would not receive a salary until the next issue was turned in. In late 1978 White resigned, and returned all manuscripts in <b>his</b> <b>possession</b> to their authors, even if copy-edited and ready for publication. White claimed Bernhard had told him to do this, though Bernhard denied it.|$|E

5|$|Arriving {{back in the}} wilderness, {{the trio}} sets up camp when Snatchers find and chase them down. Hermione strikes Harry with a curse to {{disguise}} his features as the Snatchers take them all to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange imprisons Harry and Ron in the cellar with Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook the goblin. Bellatrix then tortures Hermione for information on how they got the sword of Gryffindor, which Bellatrix claims was in her vault at Gringott's. Harry requests help, communicating {{with a piece of}} broken mirror in <b>his</b> <b>possession.</b> Dobby apparates into the cellar to save them. Harry and Ron rush to save Hermione, and a battle ensues that sees Harry disarm Draco Malfoy. Dobby drops a chandelier above Bellatrix, forcing her to release Hermione. Bellatrix throws her knife at them as Dobby grabs everyone and disapparates. They arrive at Shell Cottage and find that Bellatrix's knife has fatally wounded Dobby. Harry insists that they bury Dobby properly without any magic, which they all agree to do.|$|E
5|$|Botanist Robert Brown was {{the first}} to write a {{detailed}} scientific description of the koala in 1814, based on a female specimen captured near what is now Mount Kembla in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Austrian botanical illustrator Ferdinand Bauer drew the animal's skull, throat, feet, and paws. Brown's work remained unpublished and largely unnoticed, however, as his field books and notes remained in <b>his</b> <b>possession</b> until his death, when they were bequeathed to the British Museum (Natural History) in London. They were not identified until 1994, while Bauer's koala watercolours were not published until 1989. British surgeon Everard Home included details of the koala based on eyewitness accounts of William Paterson, who had befriended Brown and Bauer during their stay in New South Wales. Home, who in 1808 published his report in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, gave the animal the scientific name Didelphis coola.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of his wedding to Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) is urged to flee Walford by his father and uncle after {{becoming}} the prime suspect in the investigation of the murder of local landlord Archie Mitchell. Bradley's father Max (Jake Wood) distracts the police while Bradley and Stacey attempt to escape from Albert Square. Elsewhere, Archie's youngest daughter Roxy (Rita Simons) suspects that her sister Ronnie (Samantha Womack) is the murderer. She accuses Ronnie, who tells her that their father raped Stacey, and confesses that he did the same to her when she was a child. Ronnie and Roxy's cousin Phil (Steve McFadden) ransacks the home of Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), believing that Ian has in <b>his</b> <b>possession</b> a cufflink which would implicate him in Archie's murder. He exits without finding it, leaving Ian and Dot Branning (June Brown) to watch an old videotape of their family and friends from the past 25 years, reminiscing about the past.|$|E
