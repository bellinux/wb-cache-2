5|$|August 19, 1991– Hurricane Bob {{parallels}} the state offshore, causing up to 3inches (8cm) of rain across the state; damage <b>is</b> <b>minimal.</b>|$|E
5|$|August 20, 1981– Tropical Storm Dennis brushes the Outer Banks with {{moderate}} rainfall peaking at 10.7inches (271mm) near Wilmington; scattered power outages and road closures from flooding are reported, but damage <b>is</b> <b>minimal.</b>|$|E
5|$|July 23, 1985- Tropical Storm Bob makes {{landfall}} near Fort Myers, {{and while}} slowly {{moving across the}} state it drops heavy rainfall peaking at 21.5inches (546.1mm) in Everglades City. Despite the rainfall, damage <b>is</b> <b>minimal.</b>|$|E

5|$|Most high-energy particles, beside {{displacing}} carbon atom {{from the}} lattice site, also pass it enough surplus energy for a rapid migration through the lattice. However, when relatively gentle gamma irradiation is used, this extra energy <b>is</b> <b>minimal.</b> Thus the interstitials remain near the original vacancies and form vacancy-interstitials pairs identified through optical absorption.|$|E
5|$|September 18, 2004- The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Ivan produce heavy rainfall {{for a few}} hours, causing creek flooding and drainage problems. Damage <b>is</b> <b>minimal.</b>|$|E
5|$|September 19, 2000- The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Gordon produce heavy rainfall {{for a few}} hours, resulting in rainfall totals of up to 1.82inches (46mm) in Newark. The precipitation causes the Christina River to crest at 9.13feet (2.78m) above flood stage, though damage <b>is</b> <b>minimal.</b>|$|E

5|$|A Sudoku with 24 clues, {{dihedral}} symmetry (symmetry on both orthogonal axis, 90° rotational symmetry, 180° rotational symmetry, and diagonal symmetry) {{is known}} to exist, and is also automorphic. Again here, {{it is not known}} if this number of clues <b>is</b> <b>minimal</b> for this class of Sudoku. The fewest clues in a Sudoku with two-way diagonal symmetry is believed to be 18, and in at least one case such a Sudoku also exhibits automorphism.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} psychosocial {{interventions}} {{may be useful}} in the treatment of schizophrenia including: family therapy, assertive community treatment, supported employment, cognitive remediation, skills training, token economic interventions, and psychosocial interventions for substance use and weight management. Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, may reduce relapses and hospitalizations. Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse <b>is</b> <b>minimal.</b> Evidence for metacognitive training is mixed with one 2016 review finding benefit and another not. Art or drama therapy have not been well-researched.|$|E
5|$|Abbas Kiarostami's film Ten (2002) was an {{experiment}} that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. Kiarostami fastened cameras to the dashboard of a car, and then allowed his actors to act. There was no film crew in the car, and no director. There is no camera movement, {{other than the}} movement of the car which carries the camera. There <b>is</b> <b>minimal</b> cutting and editing.|$|E

40|$|Let k be a field. A finite {{dimensional}} k-algebra {{is said to}} <b>be</b> <b>minimal</b> representation-infinite {{provided it}} is representation-infinite and all its proper factor algebras are representation-finite. Our aim is to classify the special biserial algebras which <b>are</b> <b>minimal</b> representation-infinite. The second part describes the corresponding module categories...|$|R
50|$|In particular, if both Stinespring {{representations}} <b>are</b> <b>minimal,</b> W <b>is</b> unitary. Thus <b>minimal</b> Stinespring representations <b>are</b> unique up to {{a unitary}} transformation.|$|R
5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger <b>is</b> <b>minimal.</b> However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic {{diversity}} <b>is</b> <b>minimal</b> in Navenby. Statistics for 2001 {{show that}} of 707households questioned, 703 were classed as white. Of those 707households, 104 were pensioners living alone, 176 were couples without children, 27 were lone parents and 153couples with dependent children. 343 of the households {{had at least}} one vehicle. Sickness rates were surprising high – with 237households reporting one or more people with limiting long-term illness. A total of 82% call themselves Christians.|$|E
5|$|Genes with a {{most recent}} common ancestor, {{and thus a}} shared {{evolutionary}} ancestry, are known as homologs. These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they are known as paralogous genes, or {{are the result of}} divergence of the genes after a speciation event, where they are known as orthologous genes, and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms. It is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes, although the difference <b>is</b> <b>minimal.</b>|$|E

5|$|Impala feed on {{soft and}} nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and <b>is</b> <b>minimal</b> in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E
5|$|Many Sudokus {{have been}} found with 17 clues, {{although}} finding them is not a trivial task. A paper by Gary McGuire, Bastian Tugemann, and Gilles Civario, released on 1 January 2012, explains how it was proved through an exhaustive computer search that the minimum number of clues in any proper Sudoku is 17, and this was independently confirmed in September 2013. A few 17-clue puzzles with diagonal symmetry were provided by Ed Russell, after a search through equivalence transformations of Gordon Royle's database of 17-clue puzzles. Sudoku puzzles with 18 clues {{have been found}} with 180° rotational symmetry, and others with orthogonal symmetry, {{although it is not}} known if this number of clues <b>is</b> <b>minimal</b> in either case. Sudoku puzzles with 19 clues have been found with two-way orthogonal symmetry, and again it is unknown if this number of clues <b>is</b> <b>minimal</b> for this case.|$|E
5|$|Mass transit {{accounts}} for 9% of total U.S. work trips. Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use intercity rail to travel, {{partly because of}} the low population density throughout much of the U.S. interior. However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010. Also, light rail development has increased in recent years. Bicycle usage for work commutes <b>is</b> <b>minimal.</b>|$|E

5|$|Special coins {{for sale}} to {{collectors}} were struck in proof finish through {{the run of the}} Susan B. Anthony dollar, and some minting variations are valuable to collectors. However, most circulation strikes remained in government stockpiles for several years after minting, so many of the coins are available in uncirculated grades, and the premium over face value <b>is</b> <b>minimal.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} cost of insecticide resistance is significant, but published {{data on the}} subject <b>is</b> <b>minimal.</b> In 1994, total costs of the insecticide and crop losses in the US state of Michigan were $13.3 million, representing 13.7% of {{the total value of}} the crop. The estimate of the cost implication of insecticides and crop losses per hectare is $138–368. Long-term increased cost to the Michigan potato industry caused by insecticide resistance in Colorado potato beetle was estimated at $0.9 to $1.4 million each year.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{occasionally}} {{a host of}} parasitic cuckoos, such as the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), but this <b>is</b> <b>minimal</b> because the common blackbird recognizes the adult of the parasitic species and its non-mimetic eggs. In the UK, only three nests of 59,770 examined (0.005%) contained cuckoo eggs. The introduced merula blackbird in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, has, over the past 130 years, {{lost the ability to}} recognize the adult common cuckoo but still rejects non-mimetic eggs.|$|E
