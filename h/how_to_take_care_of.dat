By November 1916 he was in Iași, Western Moldavia; a month later, he began a long journey to Paris, arriving there in 1917. In the French capital, he reunited with his writer friend Eftimiu, as another member of the isolated Romanian cell.

Other sources indicate that he was also the press agent for the Romanian military attaché in France. He proposed to Eftimiu that they work together on a screenplay about the legendary Romanian ancestors of Pierre de Ronsard. The project was aborted when Eftimiu discovered that the necessitous Gaumont would not even hire him as an extra.|$|E

Kierkegaard had already discussed anger in his Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 where he quoted The Epistle of James, Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, because man’s anger does not work what is righteous before God. (James 1:17-22) Earlier in the same discourse he had discussed equality. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. He asks pointed questions, [...] "Did the woman who was a sinner feel her guilt more deeply when the scribes were accusing her than when there was no accuser anymore and she stood alone before the Lord! But you also realize that the most dangerously deceived person is the one who is self-deceived, that the most dangerous condition is that of the one who is deceived by much knowledge, and, furthermore, that it is a lamentable weakness to have one’s consolation in another’s light-mindedness, {{but it is also a}} lamentable weakness to have one’s terror from another’s heavy-mindedness.

The purpose of the thesis was to identify and build up children's knowledge related to the life and work on the farm, and to adapt science activities with gained knowledge. This part consists of theoretical, empirical and practical work. The theoretical part includes some of the main features of Slovenian farms and presents us {{a detailed description of the}} main characteristics of the farm animals. The empirical part includes research date, which we have got from 70 preschool children from kindergarten, aged between five and six years. The questions in this part have been structured to reveal their ideas about animals, life and work on the farm. The responses have given us the basis for guidelines for activities with children [...] At the end of practical work we questioned childreen again and after that we could see, how childreens ideas about farm changed. Practical part includes children work and their researching farm life and farm work.
