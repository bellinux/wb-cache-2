50|$|The Jupiter-C and Juno I rockets {{used the}} same first-stage engines as the missile, but needed more thrust due to the {{increased}} size of the payload/warhead.

5000|$|As Hydyne-LOX (liquid oxygen) was {{the fuel}} {{combination}} {{used for the}} Redstone rocket, Morgan whimsically suggested naming her new fuel formulation Bagel, since the rocket's propellant combination would then be called Bagel and LOX. Her suggested name for the new fuel was not accepted, and Hydyne was chosen instead by the U.S. Army. The standard Redstone was fueled with a 75% ethyl alcohol solution, but the Jupiter-C first stage had used Hydyne fuel, a blend of 60% unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and 40% <b>diethylenetriamine</b> (DETA).

50|$|Redstone {{was capable}} of flights from 57.5 mi to 201 mi. It {{consisted}} of a thrust unit for powered flight and a missile body for overall missile control and payload delivery on target. During powered flight, Redstone burned a fuel mixture of 25 percent water-75 percent ethyl alcohol with liquid oxygen (LOX) used as the oxidizer. Later Redstones used Hydyne, 60% unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and 40% <b>diethylenetriamine</b> (DETA), as the fuel. The missile body consisted of an aft unit containing the instrument compartment, and the warhead unit containing the payload compartment and the radar altimeter fuze. The missile body was separated from the thrust unit 20-30 seconds after the termination of powered flight, {{as determined by the}} preset range to target. The body continued on a controlled ballistic trajectory to the target impact point. The thrust unit continued on its own uncontrolled ballistic trajectory, impacting short of the designated target.|$|E
50|$|The chelate effect {{increases}} {{as the number}} of chelate rings increases. For example, the complex Ni(dien)2)2+ is more stable than the complex Ni(en)3)2+; both complexes are octahedral with six nitrogen atoms around the nickel ion, but dien (<b>diethylenetriamine,</b> 1,4,7-triazaheptane) is a tridentate ligand and en is bidentate. The number of chelate rings is one less than the number of donor atoms in the ligand. EDTA (ethylenediaminetetracetic acid) has six donor atoms so it forms very strong complexes with five chelate rings. Ligands such as DTPA, which have eight donor atoms are used to form complexes with large metal ions such as lanthanide or actinide ions which usually form 8- or 9-coordinate complexes.5-membered and 6-membered chelate rings give the most stable complexes. 4-membered rings are subject to internal strain because of the small inter-bond angle is the ring. The chelate effect is also reduced with 7- and 8- membered rings, because the larger rings are less rigid, so less entropy is lost in forming them.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vesicant}} {{property of}} mustard agent can be neutralized by oxidation or chlorination, using household bleach (sodium hypochlorite), or by nucleophilic attack using e.g. decontamination solution [...] "DS2" [...] (2% NaOH, 70% <b>diethylenetriamine,</b> 28% ethylene glycol monomethyl ether). After initial decontamination of the victim's wounds is complete, medical treatment {{is similar to}} that required by any conventional burn. The amount of pain and discomfort suffered by the victim is comparable as well. Mustard agent burns heal slowly, and, as with other types of burn, present a risk of sepsis caused by pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mechanisms behind sulfur mustard’s effect on endothelial cells are still being studied, but recent studies have shown that high levels of exposure can induce high rates of both necrosis and apoptosis. In vitro tests have shown that at low concentrations of sulfur mustard, where apoptosis is the predominant result of exposure, pretreatment with 50 mM N-acetyl-L-cystein (NAC) was able to decrease the rate of apoptosis. NAC protects actin filaments from reorganization by sulfur mustard, demonstrating that actin filaments play a large role in the severe burns observed in victims.|$|E
