5|$|Hermione {{identifies}} in Dumbledore's book {{a strange}} symbol also worn {{at the wedding}} by Xenophilius Lovegood. They visit him and are told the symbol represents the mythical Deathly Hallows, three objects from an old fairy tale titled The Tale of the Three Brothers: the Elder Wand, an unbeatable wand; the Resurrection Stone, able to summon the dead; and an infallible Invisibility Cloak. Harry realises Voldemort is seeking (and later successfully obtains) the Elder Wand, won by Dumbledore after Grindelwald's defeat, believing it {{will allow him to}} overpower the connection between his own wand and Harry's. Harry also recognises the Resurrection Stone as that found by Dumbledore which later become the second <b>Hallow,</b> and believes it to be hidden inside the Snitch Dumbledore left for him, but can't open it. The description of the third <b>Hallow</b> also matches that of his own inherited Invisibility Cloak.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hallows</b> {{began work}} on Hollyoaks in 1995 and joined the show from its ninth episode. <b>Hallows</b> was {{initially}} executive producer until Phil Redmond stepped down as role of producer and she took on the role. <b>Hallows</b> was responsible for Hollyoaks: Breaking Boundaries, which saw the rape of long-term character Luke Morgan, {{which was the first}} time male rape was tackled in a soap. <b>Hallows</b> worked closely with advisers from rape-related support groups to help her make the storyline realistic. <b>Hallows</b> was responsible for killing off Lewis Richardson in her time on the show, which occurred in Hollyoaks: Movin' On. <b>Hallows</b> also worked on Hollyoaks: After Hours. <b>Hallows</b> was responsible for the increase in late-night specials, which proved popular with viewers, so she decided to respond to requests for more. <b>Hallows</b> also worked on Hollyoaks: On the Pull and Hollyoaks: Let Loose. <b>Hallows</b> left the show in 2005 when David Hanson took over as producer. While on the show, Hollyoaks received a nomination for Royal Television Society Award, which <b>Hallows</b> felt was rewarding.|$|R

5|$|Hoshino based the {{character}} on a celebrity whose identity {{she refused to}} reveal. Primarily a clown in his early appearances, she later gave him a human form which would have an unspecified impact in the series. Critical reaction to the Millennium Earl has been positive, with critics finding his revival {{of the dead and}} killing of humans appealingly ironic. His enigmatic depth in the sequel, D.Gray-man <b>Hallow,</b> was also praised. A variety of merchandise based on {{the character}} has been released.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{is popular}} with D.Gray-man readers, usually ranking {{in the top}} three on the series' {{popularity}} polls, and reaction has been generally positive in manga and anime publications and other media. His characterization has been praised, with critics noting that his calm demeanor and mysterious origin are atypical of a shōnen protagonist. Some reviewers also enjoyed Allen's multiple voice actors. Merchandise has been offered with Allen's likeness, including plush dolls, figurines, clothing and cosplay pieces. In addition to being the protagonist of the anime adaptation series D.Gray-man and its sequel, D.Gray-man <b>Hallow,</b> he has appeared in three light novels, two video games and several crossover fighting games.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino based Allen's {{characterization}} on Robin, the shorter-haired female {{protagonist of}} her one-shot comic Zone. She designed Allen's clothing to resemble {{that of the}} nineteenth century, giving him a ribbon tie and other accessories to appear gentlemanly. Hoshino gave him a pentagram-shaped scar for an intimidating image, and a calm demeanor different from her typical rambunctious, rude characters. In the anime television series, Allen was voiced by Sanae Kobayashi. The voices were recast for the 2016 anime television series D.Gray-man <b>Hallow,</b> with Ayumu Murase replacing Kobayashi. In the English adaptation of the anime series, Allen has been voiced by Todd Haberkorn.|$|E

5|$|Lenalee is {{voiced by}} Shizuka Itō in the {{original}} Japanese animated adaptation of the manga. Hoshino joked that Lenalee seemed more beautiful after she saw Itō's work. Itō was replaced by Ai Kakuma in the Japanese anime sequel D.Gray-man <b>Hallow.</b> Lenalee is voiced in English by Luci Christian. The apparent romantic relationship that grows between Lenalee and Allen in the series led to a brief video clip where Christian acting as Lenalee confesses her feelings to Allen. Christian has stated she liked the character and was happy that Funimation intended to release the series' second half in 2017 {{so that she could}} voice her again.|$|E
5|$|Lenalee's {{character}} has been popular with fans. In an Anime! Anime! poll, Lenalee was voted the third female anime character fans {{wanted to see}} in yukata. In the 30th Annual Anime Grand Prix in 2007, she was voted the ninth best female character in anime. Newtype magazine ranked her the tenth best female character in anime {{for her role in}} D.Gray-man <b>Hallow.</b> In Newtypes 2015–2016 best-of-anime awards, Lenalee was seventh in the same category. In four D.Gray-man character popularity polls, she has consistently taken the fourth spot surpassed in each poll by Allen Walker, Yu Kanda and Lavi.

40|$|I chose <b>Hallows</b> above {{any other}} novel {{in the series}} because it holds a {{stronger}} connection with alchemy than any of those before it. <b>Hallows</b> provides a density of alchemical symbols and imagery that far outshines any of its predecessors. In fact, Rowling introduces many new alchemical symbols into the series with <b>Hallows,</b> and I believe she "saves the best for last" in this respect. <b>Hallows</b> is unique because it functions as the Rubedo novel of the Harry Potter series while also serving as {{a representation of the}} complete alchemical cycle (Nigredo, Albedo, Rubedo) within itself. This capacity makes the alchemy in <b>Hallows</b> more pronounced than in earlier novels. Furthermore, <b>Hallows</b> is the first novel in the series to feature scripture from the Bible. With a Christian thread in the narrative, <b>Hallows</b> provides a means of exploration for the connection between a simultaneously alchemical and Christian narrative. Finally, <b>Hallows</b> centers much attention on the dynamic between Harry, Hermione, and Ron. I focus on this dynamic and pull from what Rowling says she may "never use in the books" to show how each character carries out his or her respective alchemical duties. In short, <b>Hallows</b> is the most concentrated example of Rowling's alchemical pen, and its place as the finale of her series cements it as the basis for my study.   M. A...|$|R
25|$|Unlike other invisibility cloaks {{known to}} exist, this is uniquely a true invisibility cloak, {{in that it}} is able to {{completely}} shield the wearer and others from sight and cannot be worn out by time or spells; other cloaks will lose their ability to conceal the wearer over time or become worn out, but the <b>Hallow</b> cloak will never fade or become damaged. At the end of Deathly Hallows, Dumbledore explains to Harry the Cloak's true magic is it can shield and protect others as well as its owner. This is apparent when it does not respond to a Death Eater's Summoning Charm while concealing Harry, Ron and Hermione in Deathly Hallows. Hermione claims that this is the <b>Hallow</b> she would choose, citing the usefulness Harry has found of it.|$|E

25|$|Harry {{also owns}} a mokeskin pouch, or small 'bag' {{that is used}} for storing items, which no one but the owner can get out. He {{receives}} this from Hagrid as a 17th birthday present. Harry uses the pouch {{throughout the course of}} Deathly Hallows to keep several sentimental (yet, as he himself admits, otherwise worthless) objects such as the Marauder's Map, a shard of the magical mirror given to him by his god-father Sirius, the fake Horcrux locket that had belonged to Sirius's brother R.A.B (Regulus Arcturus Black), the Snitch bequeathed to him by Dumbledore, containing the Resurrection Stone that had previously been set into Voldemort's grandfather Marvolo Gaunt's signet ring, which Harry discovers is actually the second <b>Hallow,</b> a letter from his mother to Sirius with part of a photo (of him and his father, James), and eventually, his own broken wand (which Harry later repairs with the Elder Wand).|$|E
25|$|Since the 49th {{year was}} already a sabbatical year, the land was {{required}} to be left fallow during it, but if the 50th year also had to be kept fallow, as the Jubilee, then no new crops would be available for two years, and only the summer fruits would be available for the following year, creating a much greater risk of starvation overall; Judah the Prince contended that the jubilee year was identical with the sabbatical 49th year. However, the majority of classical rabbis believed that the biblical phrase <b>hallow</b> the fiftieth year, together with the biblical promise {{that there would be}} three years worth of fruit in the sixth year, implies that the jubilee year was the 50th year. The opinion of the Geonim, and generally of later authorities, was that prior to the Babylonian captivity the Jubilee was the intercalation of the 50th year, but after the captivity ended the Jubilee was essentially ignored, except for the blast of the shofar, and coincided with the sabbatical 49th year; the reason was that the Jubilee was only to be observed when the Jews controlled all of Canaan, including the territories of Reuben and Gad and the eastern half-tribe of Manasseh.|$|E
25|$|The Resurrection Stone {{allows the}} holder {{to bring back}} {{deceased}} loved ones, in a semi-physical form, and communicate with them. The form of Sirius Black generated by the stone tells Harry {{that he and the}} other forms created by the stone are part of him and invisible to others. This seems to suggest that these apparitions are conjured from memories and are not really resurrected people. According to the fairy tale concerning the origin of the Deathly Hallows, using the Resurrection Stone drove the owner to kill himself because he brought his late fiancée back from the dead, and she was very unhappy in the real world for she did not belong there. By the time the stone was seen in Marvolo Gaunt's possession, it had been set into a ring that bore the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, which the ignorant Gaunt believed to be the Peverell coat of arms; he used the ring to boast about his ancestry and blood purity. Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald desired the stone, but for different reasons. While Dumbledore wanted it to communicate with his dead family, Grindelwald allegedly intended to use it to create an army of zombie-like Inferi. Harry said this is the <b>Hallow</b> he would desire most, as like Dumbledore he could name people he would like to communicate with again. Voldemort became aware of the ring's antiquity and eventually used the stone as a Horcrux, a container for part of his soul, being unaware of its additional magical properties.|$|E

5000|$|When the Earl of Shaftesbury built a {{new country}} house close to St Giles, the writing was on the wall for All <b>Hallows.</b> In 1672, Sir Anthony wrote to the Keeper of the Great Seal, {{offering}} to give King Charles II a living of his choice in exchange for being allowed to close down the living of All <b>Hallows</b> and concentrate worship at St Giles, following {{the opening of the}} newly rebuilt in 1732. The 1st earl's request to the king was granted in 1733, at which time, the St Giles and All <b>Hallows</b> parishes were merged.The newly combined parishes of St Giles and All <b>Hallows</b> took the name of Wimborne St Giles. The name is derived from the meadow stream which flows through both villages, from Old English winn and burna.
