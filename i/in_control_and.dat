5|$|It's about obsession, {{and that}} can be scary because you're not <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> you don't know where it's going to stop. It says that, at any point in {{somebody}}'s life, when they loved somebody strongly enough and that person returns, a certain touch, a certain physical gesture can turn them from being defiant and disgusted with this person to being subservient again. And it's not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back, it's the complete terror and loss of control that comes back. And I think that's ultimately a great weapon.|$|E
5|$|For the People's Republic of Poland, 1956 {{was a year}} of transition. The {{international}} situation significantly weakened the hard-line Stalinist faction in Poland; Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut died in March; it was three years since Stalin had died and his successor at the Soviet Union's helm, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced him in February. Protests by workers in June in Poznań had highlighted the people's dissatisfaction with their situation. In October, the events set in motion resulted in the rise in power of the reformers' faction, led by Władysław Gomułka. After brief, but tense, negotiations, the Soviets gave permission for Gomułka to stay <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> made several other concessions resulting in greater autonomy for the Polish government. For Polish citizens this meant a temporary liberalization. Eventually though, hopes for full liberalization were proven false, as Gomułka's regime became more oppressive. Nonetheless, the era of Stalinization in Poland had ended.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, facing {{cash flow}} problems, John Cleveland Osgood turned to George Jay Gould, a {{principal}} stockholder of the Denver and Rio Grande, for a loan. Gould, via Frederick Taylor Gates, Rockefeller's financial adviser, brought John D. Rockefeller {{in to help}} finance the loan. Analysis of the company's operations by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. showed a need for substantially more funds which were provided in exchange for acquisition of CF's subsidiaries such as the Colorado and Wyoming Railway Company, the Crystal River Railroad Company, and possibly the Rocky Mountain Coal and Iron Company. Control was passed from the Iowa Group to Gould and Rockefeller interests in 1903 with Gould <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> Rockefeller and Gates representing a minority interests. Osgood left the company in 1904 and devoted his efforts to operating competing coal and coke operations.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase defended the World Tag Team Championship against Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG). The match began with Cryme Tyme <b>in</b> <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> Shad threw JTG {{over the top}} rope onto Rhodes and DiBiase. Rhodes and DiBiase, however, {{isolated}} JTG in their corner and performed a number of offensive maneuvers on him. Rhodes attempted a moonsault onto JTG, but missed, allowing JTG to tag in Shad {{at the same time}} Rhodes tagged in DiBiase. Shad performed a back body drop on DiBiase, but while the referee was distracted, Rhodes performed a DDT on Shad. DiBiase attempted to cover Shad, but was forced to break the cover as Shad placed his foot on the bottom rope. JTG attempted an inside cradle pin on Rhodes, but Shad accidentally pushed DiBiase on Rhodes, reversing the pinfall attempt so that Rhodes scored the pin over JTG, retaining his and DiBiase's title in the process.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{compared}} the effect of temperature variation (> 32 ºC to < 27 ºC) on latency differences median to ulnar (ringdiff), median to radial (thumbdiff), palmar median to ulnar (palmdiff) and the sum of three, the combined sensory index (CSI), <b>in</b> 15 <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> 12 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). After cooling, ringdiff was the most reliable technique with little variation <b>in</b> both <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> patients; thumbdiff decreased dramatically <b>in</b> <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> could even come within normal limits in patients; palmdiff increased only in patients; CSI decreased significantly <b>in</b> <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> showed {{a slight increase in}} patients with no loss in electrodiagnosis accuracy. The high increase of palmdiff in patients, and the high decrease of thumbdiff <b>in</b> <b>controls,</b> after cooling, could not be explained only for fiber size in the nerve trunks. We concluded that for CTS electrodiagnosis even latency differences in same person/same limb could be significantly modified after cooling not previously emphasized in literature...|$|R

Ireland had worked with Parcells previously, when the latter was head coach of the Cowboys from 2003 to 2006.

25|$|On the March 3 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, Kurt Angle defended the World Heavyweight Championship against The Undertaker in a rematch. Undertaker was <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> {{executed}} a Tombstone Piledriver on Angle. As Undertaker made the cover, Mark Henry interfered into the match causing a disqualification. Angle was disqualified thus Undertaker won the match {{but not the}} title because a title cannot change hands via DQ. Angle retained the title but Henry started attacking Undertaker. Henry splashed Undertaker through the announcer's table. This led to a casket match between Undertaker and Henry at WrestleMania, which Undertaker won.|$|E
25|$|Assad {{was now in}} control, but {{he hesitated}} to push his advantage. Jadid {{continued}} to rule Syria, and the Regional Command was unchanged. However, Assad influenced Jadid to moderate his policies. Class struggle was muted, criticism of reactionary tendencies of other Arab states ceased, some political prisoners were freed, a coalition government was formed (with the Ba'ath Party <b>in</b> <b>control)</b> <b>and</b> the Eastern Front—espoused by Assad—was formed with Iraq and Jordan. Jadid's isolationist policies were curtailed, and Syria reestablished diplomatic relations with many of its foes. Around this time, Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt, Houari Boumediene's Algeria and Ba'athist Iraq began sending emissaries to reconcile Assad and Jadid.|$|E

25|$|Dutch policy {{before the}} 1870s {{was to take}} full charge of {{strategic}} points and work out treaties with the local leaders elsewhere so they would remain <b>in</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> co-operate. The policy failed in Aceh, in northern Sumatra, where the sultan tolerated pirates who raided commerce in the Strait of Malacca. Britain was a protector of Aceh and it gave the Netherlands permission to eradicate the pirates. The campaign quickly drove out the sultan but across Aceh numerous local Muslim leaders mobilised and fought the Dutch in four decades of very expensive guerrilla war, {{with high levels of}} atrocities on both sides. Colonial military authorities tried to forestall a war against the population by means of a ‘strategy of awe’. When a guerrilla war did take place the Dutch used either a slow, violent occupation or a campaign of destruction.|$|E
25|$|India lost {{yet another}} ODI final, their fifth {{successive}} loss and their eighth without a victory, {{as they went}} down to New Zealand in Harare. And yet again, they threw away a very promising start. Batting first after Sourav Ganguly won the toss, the returning Shane Bond and Kyle Mills kept them down {{for the first two}} overs, bowling an accurate line as the score moved to five for no loss. Sehwag and Ganguly eventually found their feet, though, and after thirteen overs they had added 72 runs, despite being beaten time and again. Jacob Oram conceded fifteen runs off his first eleven deliveries, but Ganguly holed out as he was caught by Hamish Marshall. At 72 for 1, India were well <b>in</b> <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> Mohammad Kaif started to accumulate with Sehwag. Boundaries came with regularity, as India moved past 100 and then past 150 without losing a wicket. At 153 for 1 after 24 overs, they were genuinely looking at a chance to get 300.|$|E

500|$|Alvarez {{defies the}} Aristotelian {{notion of a}} well-knit plot, as {{the story is told}} in reverse chronological order through a series of fifteen chapters, with no linear, unifying storyline. In Julia Alvarez: A {{critical}} companion, Scholar Silvio Sirias argues that [...] "a well-constructed plot has an underlying structure that promises the reader that the author is <b>in</b> <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> that any event she is telling will eventually make sense". Sirias then goes on to explain how Alvarez's initial exposure of the girls to the reader in their somewhat adjusted, adult states enables her to first evoke certain assumptions in the reader and subsequently shatter these assumptions with the disclosure of the García family's troubled past. Scholar Julie Barak argues that the reverse chronological order Alvarez employs is actually a unique stylistic technique which adds [...] "to the reader's uncertainty and instability, [...] of the Garcia girls' own ambiguities".|$|E
500|$|Although Safran {{initially}} {{intended the}} series {{to be an}} ensemble, with Alex the lead protagonist, this changed after Chopra was cast.

Although the character was initially written as Caucasian, Safran completely rewrote her character with Chopra in his mind, tweaking her background as she became half-Indian and spent ten years in Mumbai. Her casting also helped change Alex's personality; in one change, the [...] "jaded and brooding" [...] Alex became [...] "fun and warm". Safran initially focused on the character's dark side, {{saying that he had}} never imagined a positive side: [...] "Priyanka came in and played all of that but as a character who was always <b>in</b> <b>control.</b> <b>And</b> still warm and vibrant because she knew no one was going to get through her walls.
