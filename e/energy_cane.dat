40|$|ABSTRACT: The main {{interest}} in the <b>energy</b> <b>cane</b> is the bioenergy production from the bagasse. The juice obtained after the cane milling may constitute a feedstock for the first-generation ethanol units; however, {{little attention has been}} dedicated to this issue. In order to verify the feasibility of the <b>energy</b> <b>cane</b> juice as substrate for ethanol production, the objectives of this research were first to determine the microbiological characteristics and deterioration along the time of the juices from two clones of <b>energy</b> <b>cane</b> (Type I) and second, their fermentability as feedstock for utilization in ethanol distilleries. There was a clear differentiation in the bacterial and yeast development of the sugarcane juices assayed, being much faster in the energy canes than in sugarcane. The storage of juice for 8 hours at 30 oC did not cause impact in alcoholic fermentation for any sample analyzed, although a significant bacterial growth was detected in this period. A decrease of approximately seven percentage points in the fermentative efficiency was observed for <b>energy</b> <b>cane</b> juice in relation to sugarcane in a 24 -hour fermentation cycle with the baking yeast. Despite the faster deterioration, the present research demonstrated that the <b>energy</b> <b>cane</b> juice has potential to be used as feedstock in ethanol-producing industries.

30|$|Because of {{its lower}} sugar concentration, <b>energy</b> <b>cane</b> was not been widely {{cultivated}} until recently, {{with the development}} of lignocellulosic ethanol conversion technologies. In the USA, the development of energy canes with increased overwintering ability could result in a crop that has a far wider range of adaptation than the crop that presently exists [65]. Aiming to evaluate the potential expansion of the seasonal operation of Louisiana sugar mills (currently operating for only 3  months every year because of the sugarcane availability) as well as to generate ethanol in these mills, Kim and Day [66] studied the utilization of two additional feedstocks: sweet sorghum and <b>energy</b> <b>cane.</b> Based on this work, it was assumed that 13 tons of ethanol could be produced from 1  ha of <b>energy</b> <b>cane</b> (considering a productivity of 100 tons/ha), more than twice than the estimated production for sweet sorghum. Nevertheless, biomass productivity could be even greater, as presented previously. The authors raised important points regarding the <b>energy</b> <b>cane</b> processing, including the conditions for milling and pretreatment, that is still a challenge to make its use feasible at industrial scale. The concerns about <b>energy</b> <b>cane</b> processing were also discussed by Leal [67], who pointed out the uncertainties related to sugar extraction (water consumption, energy requirements, and extraction efficiency) and steam consumption during the process.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} countries, in {{particular}} those {{devoid of any}} fossil fuel, have implemented energy conservation and efficiency measures to minimize <b>energy</b> used in <b>cane</b> processing and furthermore export any excess electricity to the grid.

The application examined was fermentation products from sugar. The sugarcane results were compared with results for other sugar producing crops—US corn and UK sugar beet—to gauge its relative environmental performance.

However Australian sugarcane can exhibit high nitrous oxide emissions, which would reduce greenhouse gas advantages in some regions. For eutrophication, sugar beet provides advantages due to the avoided production of other agricultural crops displaced by the use of beet pulp as an animal feed.

This paper briefly reviews the underlying structure of sugar cane and how microwave pre-treatment may interact with sugar cane. Microwave treatment reduced the strength of sugar cane samples to 20 % of its untreated value. This strength reduction makes it easier to crush the cane and leads to a 320 % increase in juice yield compared with untreated cane when cane samples were crushed in a press.

40|$|One {{important}} {{rationale for}} bio-energy systems is their potential to save fossil energy. Converting a conventional sugar mill into a bio-energy process plant {{would contribute to}} fossil energy savings via the extraction of renewable electricity and ethanol substituting for fossil electricity and gasoline, respectively.

The savings potential achieved with extracting ethanol from surplus sugar versus current practice in sugar industry in Thailand amounts to 15 million barrels of oil a year. Whether the saving benefits could be fully realized, however, depends on how well the potential land use change resulting from an expansion of ethanol production is managed.

The sweat losses measured in 32 cane cutters during the two and three hours of work averaged 637 +/- 221 and 770 +/- 282 g/h- 1 respectively, while the mean urine temperature immediately on cessation of effort was 37 - 74 +/- 0 - 46 degrees C. Despite the additional environmental heat load of the tropics, it would seem that cane cutters performing a self-paced task demanding heavy physical effort, are able to sustain work levels well in excess of those recommended for most European factory workers without obvious signs of fatigue or heat stress...|$|R
40|$|Wilmar {{owns and}} {{operates}} a mixed fleet of diesel hydraulic locomotives that operate on two foot narrow gauge rail in its Queensland operations. This network serves as an effective transport system, hauling approximately fifteen million tonne of cane annually. An assessment of the practicality of converting Wilmar's diesel locomotives to a hybrid powertrain design {{provides an opportunity for}} improving <b>energy</b> efficiency of <b>cane</b> transport and requires the duty cycle performance of the locomotive to be assessed prior to further work. This paper presents a novel method to determine the tractive effort and energy requirements for the duty cycle, using track dependant physical equations of propulsion dynamics, as the conventional methods of dynamometer car measurements and empirical equations are restricted to broad-gauge rail. A simulation model was developed in MATLAB to determine the performance parameters of a modifiable real–time diesel-hydraulic train configuration. Additionally, the performance requirements of the hybrid powertrain in comparison to the diesel-hydraulic powertrain was demonstrated by developing an optimisable real-time model of a series-hybrid locomotive in SIMSCAPE, an interactive tool for physical systems simulation in MATLAB. Testing and validation using field data obtained from on-board sensors, the locomotive's Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and a track profile extraction method exclusively developed for this research, demonstrated that the model was capable of accurately predicting the performance parameters and energy consumption of the diesel-hydraulic locomotive for a particular duty cycle. The hybrid model developed in SIMSCAPE exhibited superior traction performance and significant improvements in fuel efficiency and emissions compared to the diesel-hydraulic locomotive for the same duty cycle...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects were}} {{assessed}} of two energy sources in concentrate (ground grain corn vs. citrus pulp) and two nitrogen sources (soybean meal vs. urea) on rumen metabolism in four buffaloes and four zebu cattle (Nellore) with rumen cannula and fed in a 4 &# 215; 4 Latin square design with feeds containing 60 % sugar <b>cane.</b> <b>Energy</b> supplements {{had no effect}} on the rumen ammonia concentration in cattle, but ground grain corn promoted higher ammonia level than citrus pulp in buffalo. Urea produced higher ammonia level than soybean meal in both animal species. On average, the buffaloes maintained a lower rumen ammonia concentration (11. 7 mg/dL) than the cattle (14. 5 mg/dL). Buffaloes had lower production of acetic acid than cattle (58. 7 vs. 61. 6 mol/ 100 mol) and higher of propionic acid (27. 4 vs. 23. 6 mol/ 100 mol). There was no difference in the butyric acid production between the buffaloes (13. 6 mol/ 100 mol) and cattle (14. 8 mol/ 100 mol) and neither in the total volatile fatty acids concentration (82. 5 vs. 83. 6 mM, respectively). The energy or nitrogen sources {{had no effect on}} rumen protozoa count in either animal species. The zebu cattle had higher rumen protozoa population (8. 8 &# 215; 10 (5) /mL) than the buffaloes (6. 1 &# 215; 10 (5) /mL). The rumen protozoa population differed between the animal species, except for Dasytricha and Charonina. The buffaloes had a lower Entodinium population than the cattle (61. 0 vs 84. 9 %, respectively) and a greater percentage of species belonging to the Diplodiniinae subfamily than the cattle (28. 6 vs. 1. 4 %, respectively). In cattle, ground corn is a better energy source than citrus pulp for use by Entodinium and Diplodiniinae. In the buffaloes, the Entodinium are favored by urea and Diplodiniinae species by soybean meal...|$|R
