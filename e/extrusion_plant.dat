40|$|Transverse Welds {{occur in}} the billet-to-billet {{extrusion}} process, which is often used in modern aluminum <b>extrusion</b> <b>plants</b> for the purpose production. The transverse weld introduces a discontinuity at the weld interface in the extruded product and in many structural applications. This is not acceptable because it can severely reduce the strength and is detrimental {{to the quality of}} the extruded product. The requirement of wasting a certain portion of the product becomes undesirable. Since the occurrence of this defect is troublesome in industrial practice, it is important to study the conditions leading to transverse welding formation. This study concentrated on improving the understanding of the behavior and the formation mechanisms of transverse welds with the aim of providing general guidance for aluminum extrusion industry. The experiment of extrusion process was undertaken in parallel with a finite element analysis (FEA) using ABAQUS software, a suite of powerful engineering simulation programs, based on the finite element method, that can solve problem ranging from relatively simple linear analysis to the most challenging nonlinear simulations, including metal forming simulation. An axisymmetric 2 D geometric model of the tooling and billet was constructed for the analysis. In this work, transverse welding formation was investigated by a variation of die reduction. The influence of coefficient of friction, and punch speed were also observed. The formation and metal flow behavior of transverse welds in the aluminum extrusion process have been investigated using an FEA simulation technique. It was shown that inhomogeneous metal flow occurred and a transverse welding pattern were revealed. ...|$|R
40|$|Soybean is {{cultivated}} in Europe as a GM free cultivation. In {{spite of a}} growing demand in identity preserved (IP) seeds and of the high environmental benefit of the soybean in the crop rotations,a great decrease of the soybean acreage has been observed in France and in Europe since 2002. That’s why in 2007, Cetiom and Onidol, two bodies of the French oilseed crop organisation decided {{to carry out a}} comprehensive survey on the different actors of the soybean production chain from the farmers until the feed and food soybean users. The study showed that 12 % of the total acreage is planted under organic farming and that most surfaces are still grown under IP process. It also highlighted that the decrease of soybean’s surfaces till 2008 was mainly due to an insufficient economic competitiveness compared to other crops. The survey proved that the French production gained market shares between 2002 and 2007 for the soyfood industry supply (from 5 to 25 % of the total acreage). The remaining production is processed in small or medium <b>extrusion</b> <b>plants</b> for the local animal raising. The needs of the industry were described in details showing that the main asset of the French production is the good control of the whole production chain, the high quality management by the farmers, the good protein content and shorter logistic chains compared to the imported soybean. For the future, the increasing environmental constraints and the larger demand of European soyfood industry but also of local high-quality feed and animal raising could lead soybean to recover between 100 000 and 150 000 hectares in France...|$|R

40|$|YesExtrusion {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} production methods in the polymer processing industry and is used in the production {{of a large number of}} commodities in a diverse industrial sector. Being an energy intensive production method, process energy efficiency {{is one of the}} major concerns and the selection of the most energy efficient processing conditions is a key to reducing operating costs. Usually, extruders consume energy through the drive motor, barrel heaters, cooling fans, cooling water pumps, gear pumps, etc. Typically the drive motor is the largest energy consuming device in an extruder while barrel/die heaters are responsible for the second largest energy demand. This study is focused on investigating the total energy demand of an <b>extrusion</b> <b>plant</b> under various processing conditions while identifying ways to optimise the energy efficiency. Initially, a review was carried out on the monitoring and modelling of the energy consumption in polymer extrusion. Also, the power factor, energy demand and losses of a typical <b>extrusion</b> <b>plant</b> were discussed in detail. The mass throughput, total energy consumption and power factor of an extruder were experimentally observed over different processing conditions and the total extruder energy demand was modelled empirically and also using a commercially available extrusion simulation software. The experimental results show that extruder energy demand is heavily coupled between the machine, material and process parameters. The total power predicted by the simulation software exhibits a lagging offset compared with the experimental measurements. Empirical models are in good agreement with the experimental measurements and hence these can be used in studying process energy behaviour in detail and to identify ways to optimise the process energy efficiency.

40|$|Performance {{and working}} {{life of the}} die and {{affiliated}} tooling are very important factors contributing to the economic success of an extrusion setup, as they directly translate into productivity and product quality.

Efficiency and economics of any <b>extrusion</b> <b>plant</b> can be significantly improved by minimizing die defects and enhancing die life through practical measures adopted during the design and service stages of the die. Die making has been more of an art than a science, learnt through years of trial and error. Only a few extrusion die manufacturers exist around the world, religiously guarding the trade secrets to production of successful dies.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to optimize the principal extrusion variables by means of manufacturing simulation of the extrusion model. The finite element analysis of the extrusion model does not consider the manufacturing process in its modeling. Therefore, the process parameters obtained through such an analysis remains highly theoretical in that these parameters differ from the actual extrusion process parameters. Additionally, due to the nature of the extrusion process, it is often quite difficult to determine the cause of an extrusion problem and find its proper solution, particularly if it must be done quickly. The manufacturing simulation of the extrusion process prior to plant execution helps to make the actual extrusion operation more efficient because more realistic parameters may be obtained through the simulation. Additionally, troubleshooting the process becomes simpler. In this paper, we have developed the simulation model of a real <b>extrusion</b> <b>plant</b> using IGRIP. The model of the plant is simulated in IGRIP using the Graphical Simulation Language (GSL). The dynamics of the plant is also incorporated in the simulation model.

40|$|The {{molecular}} weight and its distribution, degree of long chain branching and cooling rate strongly influence crystallinity during processing, {{which in turn}} determines the processability and the ultimate properties of the blown film. Generally {{a decrease in the}} number of branches and {{molecular weight}} of the polymer and the cooling rate results in an increase of the crystallinity. Length of the main chain and extent of branching in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) are also factors that affect melt rheology and film crystallinity. Long chain branched polyethylene is suitable in the blown film process due to its better melt strength for bubble stability. The objective of this article is to describe the effect of molecular properties (e. g. molecular weight and its distribution, degree of long chain branching etc) of LDPE on film crystallinity at different cooling rates of blown film extrusion.

Shoots acidified differentially the culture medium depending {{on the presence of}} the pathogen, cultivar susceptibility and shoot inoculation methods. Differences in the tolerance level against pathogen among the cultivars were distinguishable only when the shoots were inoculated at the basal end. In susceptible cultivar, the necrosis appeared after 48 h of inoculation, while in tolerant cultivars after 72 h. This system is repeatable and more reliable than already known methods, such as in vitroleaf explants or in vivoplants; it can be used all around the year to test the gene expression and products essential to characterize the genes involved in the pathogenesis.
