When I saw Eminem in L.A. for Grammy weekend, Eminem said, 'Yeah, he ripped the track.' Later on that day, I met Royce, and Royce was like, 'Yeah, {{download}} that track man. We ripped that track.

500|$|What makes [...] "Ray Of Light" [...] one of Madonna's best singles is {{the fact}} that it is such a bitch to sing. Filled with {{multiple}} octave changes, it forced Madonna to push her vocal as far as it could possibly go. The song demanded she make use of her upper register and hold notes longer than she ever had before. It really is a techno gem that is always a standout at her concerts. After hearing a sample of it for the first time in the spring of 1998, I <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> that Madonna had outdone herself. The song brings the entire album of to a whole new level.|$|E

Around this time McMahan and Walford began writing together for the band's next record, creating six new songs which the band practiced throughout the summer of 1990. Slint entered River North Records in August 1990 to record Spiderland. At that time there were no vocals or lyrics prepared for the album, so the band wrote them while in the studio. The album's producer, Brian Paulson, {{was known for his}} [...] "live" [...] recording style in the studio, with minimal takes. Paulson recalled [...] "It was weird while I was doing [...] because I remember sitting there, and I <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> there was something about it. I've never heard anything like this.

[...] "My {{realization}} of John's impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend to dwell on the ridiculous, as a rule. It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's what you see in his movies." ...|$|E
500|$|Through {{the tour}} Mars {{and his band}} mates used Sennheiser microphones, with the former relying on the Sennheiser SKM 5200-II {{wireless}} transmitter and MD 5235 capsule.

I <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> there was a better microphone and capsule combination for him". Over the time, every vocalist on the band changed the microphones they used, {{it all started with}} the background singers, followed by [...] "the front-of-house guy" [...] and finally Bruno Mars. The same brand of equipment was used for the wireless audio during the tour. Derek Brener, in charge of Wireless Touring Rig, is the front of house engineer for three to half a year ago.|$|E
500|$|Although Kidd {{drove his}} dancers hard, {{partly because he}} himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he {{required}} of them, his personal style was gentle. Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back. Andrews recalled that [...] "he looked crestfallen. Then he said, 'I wasn't trying to be mean. I <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> that when you saw it on film, you wouldn't be pleased.'

Of her return, Anderson explained [...] "I told my mum and dad that I was coming back, and they almost fell off their chairs. They said: 'Hang on, didn't Charlie die?' It's hilarious, because this time twelve months ago I was keeping it the biggest secret from everyone as to whether Charlie would live or die, and now I'm {{in the same boat}} again as far as not giving anything away."

500|$|Soon {{after his}} {{departure}} from the British-Irish band One Direction, Zayn started working on his debut solo studio album; months later, on 22 July 2015, {{it was announced that}} Zayn was recording new music with record producer Malay Ho, after the producer posted a photo with the singer on his Instagram account. Malik's management team reached out to him because Zayn was a fan of his work with artists such as John Legend, Alicia Keys and Frank Ocean. Later, Ho heard [...] "Pillowtalk" [...] and [...] "Fool for You" [...] before signing on to produce the record, and thought Malik's voice was [...] "incredible" [...] and agreed to work with him. The two recorded most of the songs in the Studio Suite at the Palms Casino Resort, inside Malik’s Beverly Hills Hotel room, {{and in the middle of}} the woods. As recalled by Ho, the work had a [...] "super creative, super free" [...] atmosphere. Zayn admitted that [...] "He’s just an amazing person.

500|$|In the Giants' match-up {{with the}} St. Louis Cardinals in the 2002 NLCS, Lofton {{delivered}} a key hit {{to help the}} Giants win their first pennant since 1989. In the ninth inning, Cardinals manager Tony La Russa summoned left-handed reliever Steve Kline to face Lofton, who had already notched two singles in the game. Giants manager Dusty Baker considered bringing a right-handed hitter to pinch-hit for Lofton, but decided against doing so {{on the advice of}} his 3-year-old son. Lofton would hit a first-pitch single to the outfield, scoring David Bell from second base and creating a 21 Giants victory. After the game, Baker remarked, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> Kenny was focused and I know you can't keep Kenny down for too long. That's why we got Kenny over here. He's a big-game player and he's been great in the playoffs." [...] The Giants would hold a five-run lead in the seventh inning of Game Six of the World Series against the Anaheim Angels, but eight outs away from winning the World Series, the Angels rallied to win 65. The Angels took Game Seven the following night, and {{for the second time in}} his career, Lofton had lost a World Series.|$|E

500|$|... "I Luv This Shit" [...] {{was written}} by August Alsina, The Exclusives (Sean McMillion and Ralph Jeanty), Samuel Irving III, Christine Massa, and Trinidad James and was {{produced}} by Knucklehead. It was recorded by McMillion and Cody Sciara at Goldie's Playhouse and Zac Recording Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance from Trehy Harris at Larrabee Sound Studios, North Hollywood. Vocals were produced by The Exclusives. Knucklehead told Vibe in 2014 that he created the song's beat and {{knew it would be}} successful, stating: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> what [...] voice was gonna do over my beat. And that beat didn't sound like thing else at the time that was out ... When I made the beat, I called him immediately after I finished it." [...] After playing the beat to Alsina and The Exclusives, they recorded the song in one hour. It is an R song instrumented by guitar, synthesizer, synth-horns and a heavy bassline. The production was compared by Spin Brandon Soderberg to the work of The-Dream. It revolves around about partying with alcohol and drugs with the central hook [...] "I love this shit", and references the vodka Ciroc, yet {{there is an element of}} sorrow to Alsina's vocals. James' verse contemplates human nature, according to Gregory Adams of Exclaim!. [...] "I Luv This Shit" [...] was originally recorded for Alsina's mixtape The Product 2 (2013), and was included on his debut EP [...] (2013). It was also a bonus track on his first studio album, Testimony (2014).|$|E
500|$|In 1989, 15-year-old Cruz {{made her}} acting debut in a music video for the Spanish pop group Mecano's song [...] "La Fuerza del Destino". Between 1990 and 1997, she hosted the Spanish TV channel Telecinco's talk show La Quinta Marcha, a {{programme}} that was hosted by teenagers, {{aimed at a}} teenage audience. She also played in the [...] "Elle et lui" [...] episode of an erotic French TV series called Série rose in 1991, where she appeared nude. In 1992, Cruz made her feature film debut at 18 as the lead female role in the comedy drama art house film, Jamón, jamón. In the film, she portrayed Silvia, {{a young woman who}} is expecting her first child with a man whose mother does not approve of the relationship and attempts to sabotage it by paying Javier Bardem's character to seduce her. People magazine noted that after Cruz appeared topless in the film, she became [...] "a major sex symbol". In an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News in 1999, Cruz commented that [...] "it was a great part, but...I wasn't really ready for the nudity. [...] But I have no regrets because I wanted to start working and it changed my life." [...] Charlie Rose of 60 Minutes noted that Cruz [...] "became an overnight sensation as much for her nude scenes as for her talent".

500|$|Carey Mulligan {{plays the}} narrator, Kathy, an introverted, observant {{character}} who projects both innocence and knowingness, and who {{over the course}} of the story develops from a passionate, optimistic child to a wise and accepting young woman. Prior to her casting, Mulligan had already read the novel a few times, considering it to be a favourite of hers. She recalled that from when she first read the book three years ago she had wanted to play Kathy. The young actress said that she could not [...] "bear the idea of anyone else" [...] portraying Kathy, although she acknowledged that she thought other people would be able to do a better performance. She was certain that someone would make a film adaptation of the novel and had hoped that they would wait until she would be old enough to play the character. Romanek told The Los Angeles Times that he originally was having difficulty finding the right actress to play Kathy; a tight filming deadline loomed prior to Mulligan's casting. Peter Rice, the head of Fox Searchlight (the company financing the film) was watching An Education at the Sundance Film Festival in January. He wrote Romanek a four-word text message: [...] "Hire the genius Mulligan." [...] When later asked why the message was so abrupt, he explained that he was still in the middle of viewing the film. Rice exhibited what was described as a [...] "rare foresight" [...] in greenlighting a film with an almost unknown lead actress. [...] "He <b>just</b> <b>knew</b> that she was it", said Romanek.|$|E
