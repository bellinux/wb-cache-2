However, the century was enough to see him retain his middle-order position <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team. Former Test leg spinner and teammate Bill O'Reillywho was in England as a journalistcriticised the selection of Brown, who had appeared to be noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role.
