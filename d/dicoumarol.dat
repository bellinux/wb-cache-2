5|$|The {{identity}} of the anticoagulant substance in spoiled sweet clover remained a mystery until 1940. In 1933 Karl Paul Link and his lab of chemists working at the University of Wisconsin set out to isolate and characterize the haemorrhagic agent from the spoiled hay. It took five years for Link's student Harold A. Campbell to recover 6mg of crystalline anticoagulant. Next, Link's student Mark A. Stahmann took over the project and initiated a large-scale extraction, isolating 1.8 g of recrystallized anticoagulant in about 4 months. This was enough material for Stahmann and Charles F. Huebner to check their results against Campbell's and to thoroughly characterize the compound. Through degradation experiments they established that the anticoagulant was 3,3'-methylenebis-(4-hydroxycoumarin), which they later named <b>dicoumarol.</b> They confirmed their results by synthesizing <b>dicoumarol</b> and proving in 1940 that it was identical to the naturally occurring agent.|$|E
5|$|After an {{incident}} in 1951, where a US Army inductee attempted suicide with multiple doses of warfarin in rodenticide but recovered fully after presenting to a hospital and being treated with vitamin K (by then known as a specific antidote), studies began {{in the use of}} warfarin as a therapeutic anticoagulant. It was found to be generally superior to <b>dicoumarol,</b> and in 1954 was approved for medical use in humans. An early recipient of warfarin was US president Dwight Eisenhower, who was prescribed the drug after having a heart attack in 1955.|$|E

He also studied metabolism and protein binding of polynuclears {{and the effect of}} the binding o DNA replication and transcription, testing the effect of various carcinogens on the hatching of shrimp eggs. From the mid-1960s onwards, Bửu Hội increasingly turned his focus to the structural facets of polynuclears which determine their ability to induce microsomal enzyme synthesis, in particular involving zoxazolamine and <b>dicoumarol</b> hydroxylation. Aside from his study of fundamental organic chemistry, chemical carcinogenesis and chemotherapy of leprosy and tuberculosis, Bửu Hội's team also conducted research into {{a wide range of issues}} of biological and therapeutic interest. These included the synthesis and testing anti-inflammatory non-steroid compounds, substituted sex hormones, anti-coagulant substances and their potentiation, antidiabetic agents, treatment of hypertension by methyl-DOPA, antioxidants and the chemophylaxy of aging and the toxicity of dioxine among others.|$|E

500|$|Warfarin is a {{derivative}} of <b>dicoumarol,</b> an anticoagulant originally discovered in spoiled sweet clover. <b>Dicoumarol,</b> in turn, is from coumarin, a sweet-smelling but coagulation-inactive chemical found in [...] "sweet" [...] clover and tonka beans (also known as cumaru from which coumarin's name derives). The name warfarin stems from its discovery at the University of Wisconsin, incorporating the acronym {{for the organization}} that funded the key research, WARF for the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the ending -arin, indicating its link with coumarin.|$|E
500|$|<b>Dicoumarol</b> was {{a product}} of the plant {{molecule}} coumarin (not to be confused with Coumadin, a later tradename for warfarin). Coumarin is now known to be present in many plants, and produces the notably sweet smell of freshly cut grass or hay and plants like sweet grass; in fact, the plant's high content of coumarin is responsible for the original common name of [...] "sweet clover", which is named for its sweet smell, not its bitter taste. They are present notably in woodruff (Galium odoratum, Rubiaceae), and at lower levels in licorice, lavender, and various other species. However, coumarins themselves do not influence clotting or warfarin-like action, but must first be metabolized by various fungi into compounds such as 4-hydroxycoumarin, then further (in the presence of naturally occurring formaldehyde) into <b>dicoumarol,</b> in order to have any anticoagulant properties. Fungal attack of the damaged and dying clover stalks explained the presence of the anticoagulant only in spoiled clover silages; <b>dicoumarol</b> {{is considered to be a}} fermentation product and mycotoxin.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few years, {{numerous}} similar chemicals (specifically 4-hydroxycoumarins with a large aromatic substitutent at the 3 position) {{were found to have}} the same anticoagulant properties.

Karl Link continued working on developing more potent coumarin-based anticoagulants for use as rodent poisons, resulting in warfarin in 1948. The name [...] "warfarin" [...] stems from the acronym WARF, for Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation + the ending -arin indicating its link with coumarin.

40|$|Thirty-five {{coumarin}} derivatives {{have been}} examined for their anticoagulant activity in rabbits by determining the prothrombin time by a modification of Quick's onestage method, {{in order to find}} out the structural features eliciting the activity.

The results show the complexity of the problem and the involvement of various factors. Among these the importance of molecular geometry is emphasized by the high activity of calophyllolide (31) * and a new synthetic compound, 4 -methyl- 2, 5 -dioxo- 3 -phenyl- 2 H, 5 H-pyrano[3, 2 -c][1]-benzopyran (30). The importance for the anticoagulant activity of a substituent in position 8 of the coumarin moiety, and the role of ability to ionize with regard to the vitamin-K-like property of some hydroxylated phenylcoumarins, are also indicated...|$|R
50|$|<b>Dicoumarol</b> (INN) or dicumarol (USAN) is a {{naturally}} occurring anticoagulant that {{functions as a}} functional vitamin K depleter (similar to warfarin, a drug that <b>dicoumarol</b> inspired). It is also used in biochemical experiments as an inhibitor of reductases.|$|E

50|$|Although 4-hydroxycoumarin {{itself is}} not an anticoagulant, it is an {{important}} fungal metabolite from the precursor coumarin, which is also not an anticoagulant, and its production leads to further fermentative production of the natural anticoagulant <b>dicoumarol.</b> This happens in the presence of naturally occurring formaldehyde, which allows attachment of a second 4-hydroxycoumarin molecule through the linking carbon of the formaldehyde, to the 3-position of the first 4-hydroxycoumarin molecule, giving the semi-dimer the motif of the drug class. <b>Dicoumarol</b> appears in spoiled sweet clover silages and is considered a natural chemical substance of combined plant and fungal origin; mycotoxin also shares these properties.

50|$|Like all 4-hydroxycoumarin drugs it is a {{competitive}} inhibitor of vitamin K epoxide reductase, an enzyme that recycles vitamin K, thus causing depletion of active vitamin K in blood.

These compounds are not antagonists of Vitamin K directly—as they are in pharmaceutical uses—but rather promote depletion of vitamin K in bodily tissues allowing vitamin K's mechanism of action as a potent medication for <b>dicoumarol</b> toxicity.

50|$|This legume is {{commonly}} {{named for its}} sweet smell, {{which is due to}} the presence of coumarin in its tissues. Coumarin, though responsible for the sweet smell of hay and newly mowed grass, has a bitter taste, and, as such, possibly acts as a means for the plant to discourage consumption by animals. Fungi (including Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Mucor) can convert coumarin into <b>dicoumarol,</b> a toxic anticoagulant. Consequently, <b>dicoumarol</b> may be found in decaying sweet-clover, and was the cause of the so-called sweet-clover disease, recognized in cattle in the 1920s. A few varieties of sweet clover have been developed with low coumarin content and are safer for forage and silage.|$|E
50|$|Sweet clover {{contains}} coumarin {{that converts}} to <b>dicoumarol,</b> {{which is a}} powerful anticoagulant toxin, when the plant becomes moldy. This can lead to bleeding diseases (internal hemorrhaging) and death in cattle. Consequently, hay containing the plant must be properly dried and cured, especially in wet environments.|$|E
5000|$|Brodifacoum is a 4-hydroxycoumarin anticoagulant, with {{a similar}} mode of action to its {{historical}} predecessors <b>dicoumarol</b> and warfarin. However, due to very high potency and long duration of action (elimination half-life of 20 - 130 days), it is characterised as a [...] "second generation" [...] or [...] "superwarfarin" [...] anticoagulant.|$|E
50|$|After the {{identification}} of <b>dicoumarol</b> and its anticoagulant activity, it became the prototype for a class of drugs. 4-Hydroxycoumarin forms {{the core of the}} chemical structure of anticoagulants known collectively as 4-hydroxycoumarins.

Pharmaceutical (modified) coumarins were all developed from the study of sweet clover disease; see warfarin for this history. However, unmodified coumarin itself, as it occurs in plants, has no effect on the vitamin K coagulation system, or on the action of warfarin-type drugs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dicoumarol</b> was {{isolated}} by Karl Link's laboratory at University of Wisconsin, {{six years after}} a farmer had brought a dead cow and a milk can full of uncoagulated blood to an agricultural extension station of the university. The cow had died of internal bleeding after eating moldy sweet clover; an outbreak of such deaths had begun in the 1920s during The Great Depression as farmers {{could not afford to}} waste hay that had gone bad. [...] Link's work led to the develop of the rat poison warfarin and then to the anticoagulants still in clinical use today.|$|E
50|$|In the {{subsequent}} years, {{most of his}} research focused on plant carbohydrates. However, the most fruitful period began when Ed Carson, a Wisconsin farmer, attracted Link's attention to sweet clover disease, described in 1924 by veterinarian Frank Schofield. In this condition, cows bled to death after consuming hay made from spoilt sweet clover. Carson's stock had been affected, and he brought a dead cow, blood that would not clot, and 100 pounds of sweet clover hay. Under the direction of Link, PhD students Harold Campbell, Ralph Overman, Charles Huebner, and Mark Stahmann crystallised the putative poison—a coumarin-related compound—and synthetised and tested it; {{it turned out to}} be <b>dicoumarol</b> (3,3'-methylenebis-(4 hydroxycoumarin)).|$|E
