In August 1975, Whitlam gave the Gurindji people of the Northern Territory title deeds to part of their traditional lands, beginning the process of Aboriginal land reform. The next month, Australia granted independence to Papua New Guinea.|$|E

5|$|Manitoba's {{judiciary}} {{consists of}} the Court of Appeal, the Court of Queen's Bench, and the Provincial Court. The Provincial Court is primarily for criminal law; 95 percent of criminal cases in Manitoba are heard here. The Court of Queen's Bench is the highest trial court in the province. It has four jurisdictions: <b>family</b> <b>law</b> (child and family services cases), civil law, criminal law (for indictable offences), and appeals. The Court of Appeal hears appeals from both benches; its decisions can only be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E

In addition, there are also more macro issues regarding the underlying assumptions of such legislation, for example, the assumption of the man as head of the household.|$|E

5|$|In the Hindu religion, {{there has}} been partial success in terms of gender {{equality}} reform laws and <b>family</b> <b>law.</b> While {{this is a major}} advancement relative to other religions in India, it is still not a complete triumph in terms of feminism and relieving oppression. Gandhi came up with the term stree shakti (women power) for the concept of womanhood. In the Hindu religion, Gods are not exclusively male. Hinduism sheds a positive light on femininity; females are considered to complement and complete their male counterparts. It {{is important to note that}} both the deity of knowledge and the deity of wealth are female.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} English Common Law. Although the {{judiciary}} is theoretically independent, its independence has been called into question and the appointment of judges lacks accountability and transparency. The highest court in the judicial system is the Federal Court, followed by the Court of Appeal and two high courts, one for Peninsular Malaysia and one for East Malaysia. Malaysia also has a special court to hear cases brought by or against royalty. The death penalty is in use for serious crimes such as murder, terrorism, drug trafficking, and kidnapping. Separate from and running parallel to the civil courts are the Syariah Courts, which apply Shariah law to Muslims {{in the areas of}} <b>family</b> <b>law</b> and religious observances. Homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|The Shia {{community}} of the Eastern province have a separate legal tradition. Although they follow Sharia, they apply the Shia Jafari school of jurisprudence to it. In 1913, when Abdul Aziz conquered the area, he granted the Shias a separate judiciary for dealing with religious and <b>family</b> <b>law</b> cases: one judge in Qatif, and one in Al-Hasa. This remained the position, with the two judges ministering to a population of around two million, until 2005 {{when the number of}} judges was increased to seven. For all other areas of law, the Shia community are {{under the jurisdiction of the}} regular Sunni courts.|$|E

The institution is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and the Police, but reports to other ministries in matters within their portfolio.|$|E
5|$|Discharged {{from the}} army, Willkie {{returned}} to Elwood. He considered {{a run for}} Congress as a Democrat, but was advised that the district was so Republican he {{would be unlikely to}} keep the seat even if he could win it, and his chances might be better in a more urban area. Herman Willkie wanted Wendell and Robert to rejoin the <b>family</b> <b>law</b> firm, but Henrietta was opposed, feeling that opportunities in Elwood were too limited for her sons. She got her way, and in May 1919 Wendell Willkie successfully applied for a job with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio as head of the legal office that advised workers on wills and other personal matters. He was soon bored there, and on the advice of his wife, left for a law firm despite an offer from Harvey Firestone to double his salary. Firestone told the departing lawyer that he would never amount to anything because he was a Democrat.|$|E

40|$|With the world's fourth-largest Muslim population, Bangladesh is an {{important}} case study in the exploration {{of what it means}} to be a 'secular' country with Islam as a state religion. One important mechanism through which to analyse the relationship between religion and the state is through the country's <b>laws,</b> and <b>family</b> <b>laws</b> are especially significant in that they represent the stateâs determination of which long-standing social and religious practices find their way into legislation as a representation of societal values. As with many other countries with significant Muslim populations, personal status legislation has remained relatively static in the years following independence, despite attempts at change. Inspired by studies of negotiations between state and civil society actors in bringing about changes in law, this study analyses the evolution of <b>family</b> <b>laws</b> for Muslims in Bangladesh, revealing a range of voices using such laws in their negotiations between competing notions of 'Islam' and 'secularism' and their role in governance. Using parliamentary and Supreme Court records, newspaper archives, expert interviews, and secondary literature, I show that there has been little change in personal status legislation beyond procedural simplification, and that the judiciary and policymakers have had a tendency to support freedom of religious practice except in <b>family</b> <b>laws.</b> This study explores why this is the case, and focuses on the discourse around the National Women Development Policy and its clause on property and inheritance as the greatest point of contention in enhancing womenâs rights in <b>family</b> <b>laws.</b> </p...|$|R
