50|$|The {{replacement}} of the <b>infantile</b> <b>neurosis</b> by transference neurosis and its resolution through interpretation remains {{the main focus of}} the classical psychoanalytic therapy. In other types of therapy, either the transference neurosis does not develop at all, or it does not {{play a central role in}} the therapy process. Although it is more likely for transference neurosis to develop in psychoanalysis, where the sessions are more frequent, it may also appear during psychotherapy.|$|E

5000|$|Transference {{neurosis}} is a {{term that}} Sigmund Freud introduced in 1914 to describe {{a new form of}} the analysand's <b>infantile</b> <b>neurosis</b> that develops during the psychoanalytic process. Based on Dora's case history, Freud suggested that during therapy the creation of new symptoms stops, but new versions of the patient's fantasies and impulses are generated. He called these newer versions [...] "transferences" [...] and characterized them as the substitution of the physician for a person from the patient's past. According to Freud's description: [...] "a whole series of psychological experiences are revived not as belonging to the past, but as applying to the person of the physician at the present moment." [...] When transference neurosis develops, the relationship with the therapist becomes the most important one for the patient, who directs strong infantile feelings and conflicts towards the therapist, e.g. the patient may react as if the analyst is his/her father.|$|E
40|$|The author shows {{structural}} {{problems in the}} psychoanalytical approach of social life, and presents then an analytical group theme-centered on the conscious and unconscious conflicts between Jews and Non-Jews in German-speaking countries. She shows the narrow interaction {{between the individual and}} the social: the <b>infantile</b> <b>neurosis</b> is charged in a deferred action by social images linked to family history. Therefore reality, as in every neurosis, is deformed because linked to the inner world. The author finishes with an exploration of Freud’s jewishness and the notion of “identity”...|$|E

It was counterpointed by a series of visual images that alternately contested and confirmed the vocal score. Peer reviewe...|$|E
