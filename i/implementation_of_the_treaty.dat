It does, however, have a {{relationship}} with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK’s Treaty of Accession in 1972. However, Jersey does not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This {{is a result of the}} manner of <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within the European Communities like Gibraltar, being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, but that that is limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 18th century, the Tây Sơn {{rebellion}} overthrew the Nguyễn family, but one of {{its members}} Nguyễn Ánh, future Emperor Gia Long, with the aid of the French Catholic priest Pigneau de Béhaine, titular bishop of Adran, obtained a treaty of alliance with the French king Louis XVI: the Treaty of Versailles, signed on November 21, 1787. In return Gia Long promised to cede Pulo-Condore to the French and to give a concession to the French in Tourane (modern Da Nang), as well as exclusive trading rights. That treaty marks the beginning of French influence in Indochina, but the Governor in Pondicherry, Count de Conway refused to follow through with the <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treaty,</b> leaving Pigneau de Béhaine to his own means.|$|E
25|$|Benavides was {{appointed}} to the Captaincy General of Yucatán when war with England flared up again. Having acquired the rank of Lieutenant General of the Royal Armies, he commanded an expedition formed to defend the coast of Tabasco and Honduras in the War of Jenkins' Ear (1739–48). He led a small army of regulars, reinforced by the peasant militia, with orders to defend the coasts of Honduras and Tabasco, and to protect the ports chosen to supply the ships of the Royal Spanish Navy. The dispute was eventually settled by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, part of the wider settlement of the War of the Austrian Succession. With the Spanish <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treaty,</b> Benavides continued his efforts to repel the pirates and privateers preying on Spanish ships.|$|E
