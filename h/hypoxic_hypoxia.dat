J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 199 : 53 - 60, 1976. Previous experiments had shown that carbon monoxide inhalation prolonged the in vivo response zoxazolamine.

40|$|Chronic hypoxia during {{pregnancy}} has profound effects on uterine artery (UA) contractility and attenuates uterine blood flow. The present study tested {{the hypothesis that}} chronic hypoxia inhibits the pregnancy-induced reduction in pressure-dependent myogenic tone of resistance-sized UAs. UAs were isolated from nonpregnant ewes (NPUAs) and near-term pregnant ewes (PUAs) that had been maintained at sea level (∼ 300 m) or at high altitude (3, 801 m) for 110 days. In normoxic animals, the pressure-dependent myogenic response was significantly attenuated in PUAs compared with NPUAs. Hypoxia significantly increased myogenic tone in PUAs and abolished its difference between PUAs and NPUAs. Consistently, {{there was a significant}} increase in PKC-mediated baseline Ca 2 + sensitivity of PUAs in <b>hypoxic</b> animals. <b>Hypoxia</b> significantly increased phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate (PDBu) -induced contractions in PUAs but not in NPUAs. Whereas the inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 by PD- 98059 potentiated PDBu-mediated contractions of PUAs in normoxic animals, it failed to do so in <b>hypoxic</b> animals. <b>Hypoxia</b> decreased ERK 1 / 2 expression in PUAs. PDBu induced membrane translocation of PKC-α and PKC-ɛ.

In the presence of PD- 98059, there were no significant differences in PDBu-induced PKC-ɛ translocation among all groups. Treatment of PUAs isolated from normoxic animals with 10. 5 % O 2 for 48 h ex vivo significantly increased PDBu-induced contractions and eliminated its difference between PUAs and NPUAs.

However, when ischemic hypoxia was superimposed upon hyponatremia, there was elevation of brain sodium with further elevation of water. Outward sodium transport in cat cerebral cortex synap-tosomes was measured via three major pathways through which brain osmolality can be decreased. After hyponatremia, sodium transport was significantly altered such that brain cell osmolality would decrease: 44 % increase in Na+-K+-ATPase transport activity (ouabain inhibitable); 26 % decrease in amilo-ride-sensitive sodium uptake.
