40|$|Thank you for {{volunteering}} {{to write up}} notes on today’s lecture. If you scribe on a Thursday we ask that you please bring your notes by the following Thursday. At this phase bring printed notes, do not send us files. That version will be marked for corrections by us and you should correct the files accordingly and have a final version ready by the following Thursday morning, {{so that it can}} be distributed to the class within two weeks from the original lecture. To help you with your notes, we can let you photocopy the notes used in giving the lecture, and notes on the same subject in past courses. Please ask for help in understanding the material or <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> about how it should be presented. In order to make the notes more uniform and easier to read, we are providing several macros for theorems and such. Also, we ask that you follow a few stylistic conventions: Please write your notes as if you were explaining the material to another student, rather than as minutes of a meeting. That is, don’t write things like “Today we started discussing [...] . ” or “next time, we will [...] . ” or “then, someone asked the question [...] . ” Just explain the material as clearly as you can...|$|E
40|$|Well, in Paris {{they have}} the Eiffel Tower, in New York {{they have the}} Statue of Liberty and in London they have Big Ben … but Waterford has {{something}} {{that none of these}} cities have – Waterford has a Squashy Couch (that’s our youth café!). This toolkit has been developed to help guide YOU in starting up YOUR OWN youth café. So, we were thinking about why we go to Squashy Couch and why would anyone go to a youth café. First of all, it’s a break between school and home, and to be honest it’s a break from school and home. It’s safe and healthy, a secure environment where you get to meet people from other schools. You can pan out and relax, watch telly, do whatever, it’s friendly so you don’t have to worry. Then it’s a place where you’re not judged, there’s nobody looking at you and saying stuff about ‘the youth today’, and the staff look after you, you don’t get shunned or anything. You can have a proper conversation with the staff and they’ll help you if you want information about anything. In our café, the information around the walls is great. There’s stuff about your own life and about things you can do. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> you can read the stuff on the walls and find out {{what you need to know}} and then the staff will help you if you need to go further. We don’t know what we’d do without Squashy. We’ve spent our youth here. The stuff we do on Friday nights is fun and brilliant: we’ve had band competitions, theme nights, Indian nights, American nights, movie nights, art clubs and that. It’s in town and easy to get to. There’s always something to do and someone to talk to. So, YOUR café might be anything from a support for when things aren’t so great to being a place to go and just sit and hang out with friends – and everything in between. The best part is that the young people get to make some decisions about where it is, what it looks like and how it’s organised. Remember, GREAT youth cafés are flexible, so everyone can have a say. What we hoped to achieve when we were setting up our café was a place where young people wanted to go, could have their say, create a ‘home from home’ and a place where being yourself is the ‘norm’...|$|E

40|$|This {{syllabus}} {{has been}} {{submitted to the}} Rhodes College Office of Academic Affairs by the course instructor. American government is, strictly speaking, an arrangement of institutions for enacting and enforcing laws. As with machines, if we study only the motions of these institutions, we will see but {{a small part of}} what they were doing and almost nothing of why they were doing it in this or that way. The arrangement of these mechanisms of government reflect an understanding of the purposes of government and of the characteristics of those who will be, directly and indirectly, running the government. A study of American government will, therefore, involve careful thinking about questions philosophical and psychological. What ought to be the ends of government, and how can human beings secure those ends? But we should not assume that desirable goals and human behavior are readily compatible. We will look at the mechanisms, institutions, of government as crucial means for reconciling goals and motives in political practice. Our study will, therefore, be about securing as much good, or as little harm, as is possible under the circumstances. That is the essence of politics. That is what makes political thinking so demanding and satisfying. Consequently, you should expect the study of politics in the United States to be very difficult. Our work will relate to {{what you see in the}} world, but only gradually. You should bring your immediate interests and opinions to the readings and to class, but be prepared to see their deficiencies. We cannot decide intelligently (as opposed to what most journalists do) whether George W. Bush has been a good president, or whether this Congress has been successful, without a thorough understanding of the context: what are reasonable expectations? A course of study should change your life, how you think about and address the world around you. It should not trade old prejudices for new ones, but rather turn prejudice into reasoned opinion. This requires three disciplines. One is that you must be willing to expose your opinions and examine them, to argue with the readings, with your classmates, myself included. Another discipline is that you doubt the sufficiency and soundness of your prejudices and opinions; as better evidence and reasoning is presented, you should be willing to modify or abandon them. The third discipline is crucial: careful reading. Much of what we will read is densely reasoned, strange, offensive, and, therefore, difficult. React to what you read, but also attend carefully to the argument. Defects in an argument are to be found not in its conclusions but in the evidence and logic that lead to the conclusions. Allow your distaste for a conclusion to drive you to find flaws in what supports it. The more carefully you read, the more accurately you will think, and the more accurately you think, the better you will write, and the better you write [...] . you get the picture. What, therefore, will our classes be like? We are here not to swallow knowledge stones but to learn how to digest, how to integrate ideas and information into our thinking about the world and our lives. Class should engage all of us, therefore, in learning as an activity. I will say much. You should say much more. You may interrupt me. You may begin the class with a question, a statement, an observation. I will proceed, more or less, according to the syllabus, but my aim is not simply to plow through it. If you are not satisfied with your grasp of the materials and problems, you should say so. If you are not satisfied or are confused, you are far from alone. Finally, learning is a continuous activity which should unite all of the individual aspects of your life here and beyond. More narrowly, you should not treat class time and office hours as wholly distinct things. Some of the best and most enjoyable learning occurs one-on-one. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> something you want to discuss, whatever, come for a visit.
