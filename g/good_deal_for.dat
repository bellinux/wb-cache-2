500|$|The major {{departure}} of the 1997–98 season for Arsenal was midfielder Paul Merson, who joined Middlesbrough in a £4.5million deal, replacing Juninho. Wenger said of the move, [...] "You are never happy to lose a player of his calibre {{but it is a}} <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> him and for the club." [...] Middlesbrough intended to sign David Platt, but a move never came to fruition, as talks broke down between both parties. Defender Matthew Rose and goalkeeper Lee Harper joined Queens Park Rangers for a combined fee of £750,000.|$|E
500|$|During Grant's first {{four-year}} term, Hanna {{began to}} involve himself in politics. [...] At first his interest was purely local, supporting Republican candidates for municipal and Cuyahoga County offices. [...] In 1869, {{he was elected}} to the Cleveland Board of Education, but as he was traveling a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> business at the time, was able to attend less than half the meetings. [...] In 1873, disgusted by local scandals and the influence of party bosses, he and other Republicans briefly abandoned the party to elect a Democrat running for mayor of Cleveland on a reform agenda.|$|E
500|$|Welcoming the deal, {{the deputy}} general {{secretary}} of the Communication Workers Union, Dave Ward said, [...] "It's been a long time coming, but this deal delivers on the major issues that postal workers have fought for. There's a balance of pay and operational changes that will help to offset job losses and ensure our members are fairly rewarded for change." [...] Royal Mail's outgoing chief executive, Adam Crozier said that the resolution was [...] "a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> our customers as it ensures stability over the next three years," [...] and allowed Royal Mail to proceed with modernisation. On 27 April the Communication Workers Union announced that its members had voted two to one in favour of the deal, thus ending the dispute.|$|E

5000|$|The other {{statement}} by Donald Trump noted: ″The bill remains seriously flawed - particularly because it encroaches {{on the executive}} branch’s authority to negotiate. Congress could not even negotiate a healthcare bill {{after seven years of}} talking. By limiting the Executive’s flexibility, this bill makes it harder for the United States to strike <b>good</b> <b>deals</b> <b>for</b> the American people, and will drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together.″ ...|$|R
500|$|Like {{previous}} performers, Madonna was {{not paid}} for the show. According to Zack O'Malley Greenburg of Forbes, [...] "Typically, the entertainers for the Super Bowl do not get a cash payment ... This {{is the kind of}} exposure that entertainers would give their right arm for; they could do 20 Leno and Letterman appearances and still not reach that [...] audience". Greenburg wrote that with 30-second commercial spots commanding over $3 million apiece, the 12 minutes of free television exposure had a total value of $84 million for Madonna's enterprises and the singer did not have to pay for accommodations, travel, backup dancers, stage setup, advertising and publicity: [...] "Given all these benefits, playing the Super Bowl halftime show for free is more than worth the trouble. In fact, it's incredibly lucrative– and such a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> artists that some suspect a major change might be on the horizon".|$|E
500|$|Versus {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 65, based on 6 reviews. Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave it an [...] "A–" [...] {{and said that}} [...] "'Love 'Em All' describes an egalitarian sexual appetite, while 'Lingerie' offers prime faux-Prince boudoir funk. The Max Martin-produced 'DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love' shows 'OMG' didn't satisfy Usher's dance-pop Jones, but he's hardly gone soft: 'Hot Tottie,' with Jay-Z, is nasty {{in all the right}} ways." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe complimented its [...] "compact running time" [...] and stated [...] "Instead of ho-hum filler, Versus offers the strongest arrows in Usher’s quiver". About.com's Mark Edward Nero gave the EP three-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote that Usher has [...] "regained his mojo", while recommending it to fans of his music: [...] "nine songs - seven of them new - clocking in at 38 minutes is a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> this solid package of music." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today gave Versus three out of four stars and called it [...] "an abbreviated batch of fresh songs that can stand alone or as part of a deluxe original". Billboards Gail Mitchell commended the album's guest artists and wrote that it [...] "alternately bumps and throbs as a reinvigorated Usher further paves his comeback path" ...|$|E

2500|$|In late August 2006, {{an outside}} {{panel of experts}} judged that Bombardier's offer was a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> city, with one {{consultant}} saying that the proposed bid [...] "is below most of the recent comparable North American procurements." [...] In {{the aftermath of the}} report, councillor Glenn De Baeremaeker was quoted as saying, [...] "if what you have told me [...] is true, somebody owes Howard Moscoe an apology". The TTC staff have also recommended finalizing a deal with Bombardier. Some councillors, such as Karen Stintz, have continued to oppose the contract on procedural grounds. Stintz has said, [...] "it's not about Bombardier. It's about a process we didn't follow", noting that other city departments require competitive bids on contracts of this size.|$|E
2500|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{challenge to}} Jackson and Baird's theory, which more closely resembles actual legal policy, came initially from Elizabeth Warren. Warren argued that Jackson and Baird's model is dangerously oversimplified, {{and based on}} untested hypothetical assertions about behaviour. First, every system of insolvency law must necessarily make choices about how losses are distributed among creditors with multiple interest. Among these diverse interests include weaker creditors, particularly employees, who are less capable than others at diversifying the risks of insolvency. There is a distinct community interest in companies that survive, and no good reason why only creditors with provable proprietary interests in a company's winding up {{should be taken into}} account. This means it is reasonable to give preference to more vulnerable creditors, and to expect secured creditors take on some additional risk to ensure businesses survive for the greater good. The Baird and Jackson view essentially amounts to [...] "single-value economic rationality, an excuse to impose a distributional scheme without justifying it, and, incidentally, a way to work in a damn <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> secured creditors." [...] Additionally, Lucian Bebchuk has argued that the institution of security interests operates as a partially unjustified negative externality against unsecured creditors. It is not clear, argues Bebchuk, that security interests are in fact efficient, and they are capable of subsidising their activities by diverting wealth from unsecured creditors to themselves without any agreement. In the UK, Roy Goode argues that banks usually take security interests, not because they would otherwise charge a higher interest rate (and so increasing credit to businesses for the benefit of all creditors) but because they calculate the market will bear it. The taking of security depends, not on efficiency, but on bargaining power. Riz Mokal, also deeply critical of the creditors' bargain model, suggests that if one were to follow Baird and Jackson's methodology but in a truly value neutral way, one would ask what creditors would hypothetically agree to if they did not know who they were at all (i.e. whether they were voluntary or involuntary creditors, secured or unsecured). This would likely lead to a result where secured credit was not inviolable, and insolvency law could take account of diverse interests, including corporate rescue.|$|E

50|$|Ritchie Street is {{credited}} {{as the second}} largest electronic market for computer spares and peripherals in India, after Nehru Place, New Delhi, India.

This is {{due to the nature of}} the customers who visit Ritchie street, who are mostly working professionals and students. People usually get <b>good</b> <b>deals</b> <b>for</b> anything and everything, which is the reason why people flock to Ritchie street to buy goods.|$|R
