40|$|In {{this paper}} we dicuss a facial {{structure}} of the linear ordering polytope. The facet-defining digraphs Moebis ladders are introduced by G. Reinelt [4]. The definition of Moebius ladder contains the next condition: If two <b>dicycles</b> C_i and C_j, i<j have a common node then this node belongs either to all <b>dicycles</b> C_i, [...] ., C_j or to all <b>dicycles</b> C_j, [...] ., C_k, C_ 1, [...] ., C_i. We show that if this condition of Moebius ladder is relaxed then, in general, we do not obtain a facet-defining diagraph. Contrary to G. Reinelt [4] we show that digraph Z_ 4 is not facet-defining. We formulate sufficient conditions for a diagraph to be facet-defining. We introduce a new method for generating of facets of the linear ordering polytope by using known ones. (orig.)

As with unicycles, bikes lack lateral stability when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as gyroscopic or trail, is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|R

The fractional <b>dicycle</b> packing number, denoted νc*(G,w), is the maximum value of ∑C∈Cψ(C) taken over all fractional <b>dicycle</b> packings ψ. In case w≡ 1 we denote the latter parameter by νc*(G). Our main result is that νc*(G) -νc(G) =o(n 2) where n=|V(G) |. Our proof is algorithmic and generates a set of arc-disjoint directed cycles whose size is at least νc(G) -o(n 2) in randomized polynomial time. Since computing νc(G) is an NP-Hard problem, and since almost all digraphs have νc(G) =Θ(n 2) our result is a FPTAS for computing νc(G) for almost all digraphs. The result uses as its main lemma a much more general result. Let F be any fixed family of oriented graphs.

We show that for such a digraph the following holds: the value τ of a minimum integral <b>dicycle</b> cover is greater than the value τ∗ of a minimum <b>dicycle</b> cover.

Dridi's description of PLO 5 enables a simple derivation of the fact that τ = v for any digraph on 5 nodes. Combining these results with the theorem of Lucchesi and Younger for planar digraphs as well as Wagner's decomposition, we obtain that τ = v in K 3. 3 -free digraphs.
