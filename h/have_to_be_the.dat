Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even multispecific, antibodies. The degree to which they can function is impressive given that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality.|$|E
5|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, Bowlby, in Attachment and Loss, volume one of Attachment (1969), {{makes it}} quite clear that infants become attached to carers who are sensitive and responsive in their social interactions with them and that this does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> mother or indeed a female. As a matter of social reality mothers are more often the primary carers of children and therefore {{are more likely to}} be the primary attachment figure, but the process of attachment applies to any carer and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and the intensity of the engagement. However, attachment theory relates to the development of attachment behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer–infant interactions.|$|E

If Hassan bin Ali's name were to be included as one of the Ismaili Imams in their prayer recitation then the present Imam Prince Karim of the Nizari Ismailis would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> 50th Imam and not the 49th Imam - the way he has identified himself and is known to the world.|$|E

25|$|VEP {{testing of}} acuity is {{somewhat}} similar to preferential looking in using {{a series of}} black and white stripes (sine wave gratings) or checkerboard patterns (which produce larger responses than stripes). Behavioral responses are not required and brain waves created by the presentation of the patterns are recorded instead. The patterns become finer and finer until the evoked brain wave just disappears, which is considered to be the endpoint measure of visual acuity. In adults and older, verbal children capable of paying attention and following instructions, the endpoint provided by the VEP corresponds very well to the psychophysical measure in the standard measurement (i.e. the perceptual endpoint determined by asking the subject when they can no longer see the pattern). There is an assumption that this correspondence also applies to much younger children and infants, though this does not necessarily <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case. Studies do show the evoked brain waves, as well as derived acuities, are very adult-like by one year of age.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the strongest}} {{objection}} to cochlear implants has come from within the Deaf community, {{some of whom are}} pre-lingually deaf people whose first language is a sign language. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which, as they view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority. This is an old problem for the deaf community, going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of manualism vs. oralism. This is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the 'normal' body in the 19th century, when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated. It is important to consider the sociocultural context, particularly in regards to the Deaf community, which considers itself to possess its own unique language and culture. This accounts for the cochlear implant being seen as an affront to their culture, as many do not believe that deafness is {{something that needs to be}} cured. However, it has also been argued that this does not necessarily <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case: the cochlear implant can act as a tool Deaf people can use to access the 'hearing world' without losing their Deaf identity.|$|E

500|$|Because of the Master Chief's {{large role}} in {{previous}} games, significant effort was expended on the Spartan units.
