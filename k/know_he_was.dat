5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 20 March 2011, a group of 20 to 25 masked men, some armed with rifles and {{accompanied}} by dozens of uniformed Bahraini security forces, broke into Rajab's house. Rajab was detained and his files and a computer were confiscated. He reported that they blindfolded and handcuffed him and put him {{into the back of a}} vehicle before verbally abusing, beating and threatening to rape him. He claimed that they kicked him when he refused to say that he loved the prime minister. He was taken to a Ministry of Interior detention facility in Adliya, a suburb of Manama. After being briefly questioned about someone he did not <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> released.|$|E
5|$|During the journey, Pattle {{developed}} a fever and high temperature. Nevertheless, on 19 April {{he took to}} the skies in several missions. By this date, Pattle's fever had metamorphosed into influenza and his condition had worsened. He did not want his squadron to <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unwell. Pattle feared the effect it would have on morale and vowed to continue flying. The officer commanding No. 80 Squadron, Tap Jones, visited Pattle {{the day before and}} noticed he was very gaunt, drawn and that he had lost weight. Jones helped the weakened Pattle change into his flying gear. Jones was acting wing commander, but did not ban Pattle from operations. Pattle claimed six victories this day — three Ju 88s and three Bf 109s — plus one Henschel Hs 126 shared and two probables (a Ju 88 and a Bf 109). The battle with the Bf 109s took place over Eleusis and Tanagra airfields. He engaged III./Jagdgeschwader 77 (Fighter Wing 77 or JG 77) in a head-on position and executed an Immelmann turn which took him behind and above the Messerschmitts and allowed him to claim three of them shot down. No. 33 Squadron claimed four Bf 109s (three were lost). Among the victims was the German ace, Kurt Ubben. Ubben landed in Allied territory and was picked up by a Fieseler Fi 156, escaping to his own lines.|$|E
5|$|Erika Hügel-Marshall {{was born}} on 13 March 1947, {{the child of a}} Bavarian woman and an African-American soldier, Eddie Marshall, who had {{returned}} to the US before her birth. Her parents had met just after the end of World War II, after a relaxation of laws forbidding military personnel from interacting with civilians. According to her, black soldiers treated native German children well, distributing food and clothing, but her parents generally met in secret due to racist remarks from others. In November 1946 her father returned to the US after an illness. By that time, both of them knew that her mother was pregnant, but she did not <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> leaving until after he was already gone. A year after Ika's birth, her mother married a German and a half-sister was born the following year. Her mother and grandmother loved her and treated her like any other child, despite social disapproval. She was close to her half-sister, but her step-father was distant toward her.|$|E

5|$|The {{first series}} of Spooks saw various storylines {{involving}} the main characters. Among these were Danny's obsession {{with money and}} spending, by hacking into a credit card database to fool it {{to give him a}} better credit rating, and the discovery that Tessa is running phantom agents to pocket their money. Those storylines were intended by Brenton and Wolstencroft to show the audience that the MI5 officers are tempted by money. A principle story arc is Tom dealing with the complexities of his relationship with Ellie, who at first does not know he is a spy. This storyline was based on Mike Baker, whose wife did not <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a spy {{for the first six months}} they were together. As the series progressed, there were more difficulties with the relationship; Brenton wrote Tom's position as if the character did not see the problem. The same episode also introduced the sexual tension between Danny and Zoe.|$|E
5|$|According to Thai tradition, however, Thado Dhamma Yaza and Maha Chakkraphat {{engaged in}} single elephant-combat. (The custom {{of the time}} was for two commanders/leaders of the same status to fight in single combat. It is unclear {{as to why the}} Siamese king would have {{accepted}} to face someone of lesser rank. If he did issue the challenge, he would have challenged his counterpart Tabinshwehti and accepted to face only Tabinshwehti.) The Thai narrative continues that Maha Chakkraphat's elephant panicked and gave flight, charging away from the enemy; Thado Dhamma Yaza swiftly gave chase. Fearing for the life of her husband, Queen Sri Suriyothai charged ahead to put her elephant between the King and the Viceroy, thereby blocking his pursuit. The Viceroy then engaged the Queen in single combat, fatally cleaving her from shoulder to heart with his spear, also wounding her daughter—both mother and child met their deaths {{on the back of the}} same elephant. It is said that the Viceroy did not <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> fighting a woman until his blow struck—as she fell dying her helmet came off, exposing her long hair. Prince Ramesuan and Prince Mahin then urged their elephants forward to fight the Viceroy, drove him and his remaining forces from the field, then carried the bodies of their mother and sister back to Ayutthaya. The Siamese king meanwhile rallied his army, and retreated in good order back towards the capital. The Burmese chronicles however do not mention any instance of single combat (on elephant-back or otherwise) by the viceroy of Prome.|$|E
25|$|Roommate {{conflicts}} {{inside the}} residential dorms {{can lead to}} active bullying. In fall 2012, a Rutgers University student committed suicide after his roommate had been filming him and his boyfriend engaging in sexual activities and posted the video online for all to see. The roommate {{said he did not}} want him dead, but wanted his friends to <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> disgusted by his behavior.|$|E

They were taking dives all over the place. That's not fair play. It's disgraceful." [...] DR Congo manager Mick Wadsworth, who was also assistant manager at Newcastle during Robson's reign, agreed with LuaLua about {{the conduct of the}} Tunisia players in their 2004 African Nations Cup match.|$|R
60|$|The fever made Aaron {{naive and}} communicative, unlike himself. And <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being unlike himself, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not in proper control of himself, so <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unhappy, uneasy.|$|R
50|$|Pain {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be strongly transparent: when someone <b>is</b> in pain, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> immediately that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> in pain, and if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not in pain, <b>he</b> will <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not.|$|R
25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and he looked at me.

25|$|After Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee had departed, Major General Rooney Lee was {{the senior}} officer in charge, {{though he was}} at the far right of the line and did not <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in charge. With Rooney Lee in overall command, Colonel Munford, who was better located in any event, would be the senior cavalry officer, while Brigadier General Steuart was the ranking {{infantry}} commander. None of these officers knew that Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee were at the rear having a lengthy lunch and that they should assume additional duties.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} about Paulus' life. He lived in Alexandria, {{one of the most}} {{scholarly}} cities of the Roman world, where astrology was also at its most sophisticated. In his lifetime, Rome's power was declining and the capital of the Roman Empire had been moved to Constantinople. We <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> regarded as a considerable authority because we have the record of a series of lectures given on his work by the respected Neo-Platonist philosopher Olympiodorus some two centuries later (in 564 AD), in Alexandria. These lectures were preserved in a Commentary and both Paulus' Introduction and Olympiodorus' Commentary have been translated together, giving a view of the development of astrological technique and contemporary attitudes towards astrology from the tumultuous late Empire through the even more unstable early Byzantine Empire.|$|E

25|$|After his {{childhood}} in Troy, New York, and Rutland, Vermont, Jackson enlisted in October 1862 as a 19-year-old private in Company K of the 12th Vermont Infantry of the Union Army Jackson {{spent much of his}} free time sketching drawings of his friends and various scenes of Army camp life that he sent home to his family as his way of letting them <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> safe. He served in the American Civil War for nine months including one major battle, the Battle of Gettysburg. Jackson spent most of his tour on garrison duty and helped guard a supply train during the engagement. His regiment mustered out on July 14, 1863. Jackson then returned to Rutland, where he worked as an artistic painter in post-Civil War American society. Having broken his engagement to Miss Carolina Eastman, he left Vermont for the American West.|$|E
25|$|On July 21, 1861, John {{participated in}} the First Battle of Bull Run, a {{disastrous}} Union defeat {{just a few miles}} from the national capital. Most of the Union Army panicked and fled in a disorderly retreat. For a time during the tumultuous battle, Meigs directed the fire and movement of troops in the absence of commanding officers. Meigs' unit fell back on Fairfax, Virginia. Without orders to do so, John left the unit and returned to the capital. He reached his parents' home at about 8 A.M., and let them <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> uninjured. He said he left Company M to report to Lieutenant General Winfield Scott, commander-in-chief of all Union armed forces. Although John wished to return to his unit, his father ordered him to depart for West Point after reporting to General Scott.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} courageous efforts at the SCG was John Sattler's {{performance}} in the 1970 grand final between South Sydney and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. In the first ten minutes of the game, South's captain Sattler had his jaw broken by a punch from Manly forward John Bucknall in an off-the-ball incident. Sattler went down but pulled himself up on teammate Michael Cleary, asking the winger to help him so that the other players would not <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> hurt. In an act of supreme courage Sattler played on, refusing treatment at half time and pleas from teammates {{not to take the}} field again, to lead Souths to a famous 23–12 win. It was not until well after the game that he went to hospital. The Australian side to tour Britain was selected that night and, but for his injury, Sattler would have been picked as captain.|$|E

25|$|Born in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, Jack Hearne first {{played for}} Middlesex in 1888 against the Australians. He was not {{qualified}} until 1890, {{and when he}} played his first County Championship match, Hearne did not <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> playing until the last minute. Yet, he took six for 62, though his performances {{for the rest of}} the year were only moderate given the primitiveness of pitches at the time – something that was changing at a rate unprecedented in cricket history during Hearne's prime. In 1891, however, Hearne advanced in a remarkable way, taking 118 wickets in county cricket for only 10.33 runs apiece. This included two amazing bowling feats – 9 for 32 versus Nottinghamshire at Nottingham and 8 for 22 against Lancashire at Lord's. So much of a sensation did Hearne cause that year that Wisden named him as a Cricketer of the Year for 1892 and he toured South Africa with a party led by W.W. Read to play in his first Test. He made a surprising 40, but had almost no bowling to do.|$|E
500|$|Harry Potter is {{an orphan}} whom Rowling {{imagined}} as a [...] "scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a wizard." [...] She developed the series' story and characters {{to explain how}} Harry came {{to be in this}} situation and how his life unfolded from there. Apart from the first chapter, the events of this book take place just before and in the year following Harry's eleventh birthday. Voldemort's attack left a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead, which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort is present. Harry has a natural talent for Quidditch and became the first person in decades to get on their team in their first year.|$|E

I have since been told—though I don't know—that he actually bought a motorcycle two days ago". Maryse Bourdon, Luc's stepmother, said he had purchased the motorcycle about three weeks before. Letang, Bourdon's close friend and former roommate from junior hockey, planned to buy a motorcycle after Bourdon told him about his; because of the crash, he decided against it.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Call My Name" [...] was positive, {{with some}} critics praising the arrangement and vocals. Deborah Evans Price of Billboard magazine called the single a [...] "well-crafted number", while Matt Conner of CCM Magazine praised the song as [...] "brilliantly crafted". Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today regarded the song as a [...] "big AC-friendly single" [...] and praised it as having [...] "smart hooks, a strong melody, {{and some of}} Powell's most impressive vocal work to date during the closing vamp, belting out notes I didn't <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> capable of". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout called the song [...] "an unashamedly catchy pop rock anthem that surprisingly has a similar lyrical message to , just presented from Christ's own perspective this time around".|$|E
500|$|In the book, Rowling {{introduces}} {{an eclectic}} cast of characters. The first character {{to be introduced}} is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined him as a [...] "scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a wizard", and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him. During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, [...] "always there when you need him". Rowling has described Hermione as a [...] "very logical, upright and good" [...] character with [...] "a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness".|$|E

He also criticized the way the film was marketed upon release, stating he felt {{that it would have}} been far more effective if the film's advertising simply posed the question of [...] "what if Superman was here on earth, and didn't <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Superman?"
