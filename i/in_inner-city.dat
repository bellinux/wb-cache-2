5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Second World War, local {{authorities}} {{made an effort}} to rehouse people away from Victorian slums <b>in</b> <b>inner-city</b> Manchester. An area of Partington extended as an overspill estate {{is now one of the}} most deprived parts of the Greater Manchester conurbation. The Cheshire Lines Committee opened a railway line through the town in 1873, but it closed in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{redevelopment}} and anti-Victorianism {{resulted in}} the loss of dozens of Victorian buildings like New Street station and the old Central Library, often replaced by brutalist architecture. Sir Herbert Manzoni, City Engineer and Surveyor of Birmingham from 1935 until 1963, believed conservation of old buildings was sentimental and that the city did not have any of worth anyway. <b>In</b> <b>inner-city</b> areas too, much Victorian housing was demolished and redeveloped. Existing communities were relocated to tower block estates like Castle Vale.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to safety advice given in its publications, the RNLI offers safety advice to boat and beach users {{when the opportunity}} arises, and to at-risk groups such as anglers, divers and kayakers. The Institution runs sea and beach safety sessions for young people, particularly <b>in</b> <b>inner-city</b> areas; more than 6,000 children a week are spoken to by education volunteers about sea and beach safety, and over 800 children a week receive training. 500 children were taught to swim in 2014. In {{an effort to reduce}} the estimated 400,000 drownings a year worldwide, {{more than half of them}} children, the RNLI extends practical or strategic safety advice to lifesaver organisations overseas, in some cases providing training at the Lifeboat College.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{seeks to}} discuss how {{the role of the}} church <b>in</b> Johannesburg <b>inner-city</b> has changed through time. The fi rst sections trace the establishment of churches <b>in</b> the <b>inner-city.</b> This is followed by a discussion of the current realities <b>in</b> the <b>inner-city</b> including international migration which is giving rise to culturally cosmopolitan society in which urban ethnic spaces are emerging, often in the form of ethnic ghettos. Both formal and informal spaces of worship and religious organizations <b>in</b> the <b>inner-city</b> are mapped to help understand the contexts’ sacredness, urban culture and contemporary needs. The concluding sections discuss {{the ways in which the}} role of churches are likely to change <b>in</b> the <b>inner-city</b> <b>in</b> future. The document is concluded with a architectural proposal on how the church could deal with the challenges faced <b>in</b> Johannesburg <b>inner-city</b> today and <b>in</b> the futur...|$|R

5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the project was broad. The Adelaide City Council objected to the plan {{on the basis that}} it would interfere with the well-designed layout of the city proper. In response, the government altered the plan to redirect the line underneath the city, at a considerable increase in cost. Residents <b>in</b> <b>inner-city</b> suburbs such as St Peters were concerned about the noise of the light rail vehicles, and protested against any disruption of the Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. Test drilling commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier David Tonkin appointed Michael Wilson, an opponent of the plan, as Transport Minister.|$|E
5|$|Showing acting skill {{early in}} life, Bana began doing {{impressions}} {{of family members}} {{at the age of}} six or seven, first mimicking his grandfather's walk, voice and mannerisms. In school, he mimicked his teachers as a means to get out of trouble. As a teen, he watched the Mel Gibson film Mad Max (1979), and decided he wanted to become an actor. However, he did not seriously consider a career in the performing arts until 1991 when he was persuaded to try comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne's Castle Hotel. His stand-up gigs <b>in</b> <b>inner-city</b> pubs did not provide him with enough income to support himself, however, so he continued his work as a barman and waiting tables.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{demographics}} of the city were changing, as Catholic whites moved to the suburbs, while Orleans Parish became increasingly Protestant. New churches and parishes were being built throughout the city, while attendance <b>in</b> <b>inner-city</b> churches declined.|$|E
25|$|After the Newark Evening News {{moved to}} a {{high-traffic}} area (with the potential of trapping its delivery trucks <b>in</b> <b>inner-city</b> traffic) the Star-Ledger opened a satellite plant in Piscataway.

25|$|Around {{the turn}} of the 20th century, {{bicycles}} reduced crowding <b>in</b> <b>inner-city</b> tenements by allowing workers to commute from more spacious dwellings in the suburbs. They also reduced dependence on horses. Bicycles allowed people to travel for leisure into the country, since bicycles were three times as energy efficient as walking and three to four times as fast.|$|E

Strong votes were also recorded in Liberal-held city based seats such as Higgins (10.8%), Kooyong (11.8%) Curtin (13.4%) and Wentworth (15.0%). The primary {{vote for the}} Greens in suburban and regional areas was generally smaller.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{hoping to}} {{capitalise}} on the enthusiasm created by England's {{win in the}} 2005 Ashes series, the London Community Cricket Association began organising tape ball cricket teams for children on estates <b>in</b> <b>inner-city</b> London, where a lack of playing fields {{has led to a}} decline in popularity for traditional cricket. The matches use a variant of the Twenty20 Cricket rules designed to make matches last a half-hour or less.|$|E

25|$|Education is {{considered}} a contributing factor to why {{women are more likely}} than men to live in poverty. 63% of female households who have children under the age of 18 do not complete high school. However, for minority women, socioeconomic factors contribute to them receiving less of an education than whites. There is a high concentration of minorities in poverty living in urban areas; this contributes to poor quality of education as there is a lack of funding <b>in</b> <b>inner-city</b> schools.|$|E
25|$|Sir Michael Somare {{was called}} up to give an {{explanation}} on how he obtained a A$349,000 three-bedroom executive-style apartment with private plunge pool <b>in</b> <b>inner-city</b> Cairns in April 2007, brokered through a Gold Coast lawyer. Along with his son Arthur Somare who was PNG's State Enterprise Minister and a political heavyweight, he was questioned about a A$685,000 four-bedroom home he had bought two months prior at Trinity Beach. Ombudsman Commission, Opposition Leader Sir Mekere Morauta, and former finance minister Bart Philemon requested an explanation over the provided documents evident of the purchased property.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{back-to-back}} houses, two {{or three}} storeys high, were built in Birmingham during the 19th century. Most of these houses were concentrated <b>in</b> <b>inner-city</b> areas such as Ladywood, Handsworth, Aston, Small Heath and Highgate. Most were still in quite good condition in the early 20th century and also prior to their demolition. By the early 1970s, almost all of Birmingham's back-to-back houses had been demolished. The occupants were rehoused in new council houses and flats, some in redeveloped inner-city areas, while the majority moved to new housing estates such as Castle Vale and Chelmsley Wood.|$|E

25|$|In 1950 few {{northern}} cities yet had majority or near majority {{percentages of}} blacks, nor did southern ones: Washington, DC was 35 percent African American and Baltimore was 40 percent. From 1950 to 1970, {{the black population}} increased dramatically in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Newark, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, Cincinnati and Indianapolis. By 1960 75 percent of blacks lived in urban environments, while whites had been moving to suburbs in large numbers following WWII. Black flight has altered the hyper-urban density that had resulted from the Second Great Migration to cities (1940–70), with hyper-segregation <b>in</b> <b>inner-city</b> areas, such as in Chicago, St. Louis, and East St. Louis.|$|E
25|$|Ivor Cutler (15 January 1923 – 3 March 2006) was a Scottish poet, {{songwriter}} and humorist.

He appeared in The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour film in 1967 and on Neil Innes' television programmes. Cutler also wrote books {{for children and adults}} and was a teacher at A. S. Neill's Summerhill School and for 30 years <b>in</b> <b>inner-city</b> schools in London. He told Andy Kershaw on his radio show that he also gave private poetry lessons to individuals.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Castle Vale had a {{population}} of around 20,000 people, with the first residents moving into their new homes in 1964. Many of the new residents were of Irish descent , previously living <b>in</b> <b>inner-city</b> slums such as Aston and Nechells. As well as high-rise tower blocks, Castle Vale also had 27 four-storey blocks of maisonettes, three-storey blocks of flats, over 100 bungalows and hundreds of terraced and semi-detached houses. All the houses had modern features that the houses of the slums lacked such as electricity, indoor toilets and central heating. Many of the houses also had gardens to the front and rear, whilst most of the flats in the tower blocks had private balconies.|$|E
