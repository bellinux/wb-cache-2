40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} genistein (Gen) on interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secreted by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) of rats with type Ⅱ collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Methods: Type Ⅱ collagen was injected to induce arthritis in rats, and arthritis index was applied to evaluate whether the arthritis was induced successfully. The primary FLSs were separated from synovial membranes by using type Ⅱ collagenase digestion. Then the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) was estimated by flow cytometry (FCM). After addition of <b>different</b> concentrations of <b>Gen</b> into the FLSs, IL- 1 β and TNF-α contents in the supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Three days after collagen injection, the rats started to develop arthrocele and the arthritis index increased gradually. The arthritis index of CIA group {{was significantly higher than}} that of the control group. The expression of VCAM- 1 was up to 85. 5 % in the 4 th generation FLSs, indicating that most part of the cultured cells were type-B synoviocytes. After administration of <b>different</b> concentrations of <b>Gen</b> (100, 200, 400 μmol/L), the contents of IL- 1 β and TNF-α in supernatants of FLSs were decreased dose-dependently. Conclusion: Genistein can suppress the secretion of TNF-α and IL- 1 β in FLSs dose-dependently, which {{may be one of the}} mechanisms for genistein in inhibiting the arthromeningitis of CIA rats...|$|R

40|$|The {{hyaluronidase}} gene (hylP 2) from {{a second}} group A streptococcal bacteriophage was isolated from ATCC T-type- 22 hyaluronidase-producing strain 10403, a strain known to produce increased amounts of extracellular hyaluronidase. Sequence analysis of hylP 2 and alignment with the previously described bacteriophage hyaluronidase gene (hylP) showed {{a high degree of}} similarity; however, hylP 2 had deletions of regions specifying 34 amino acids. Twenty-eight of the deleted amino acids were in a region of HylP containing a series of collagen-like Gly-X-Y repeating units. By employing primers for both hylP and hylP 2, PCR amplification resulted in fragments of appropriate sizes in 97 % of the strains tested, with some strains producing two fragments, indicating the presence of at least two phages. When the hylP 2 gene was introduced via a plasmid vector into a non-hyaluronidase-producing Streptococcus pyogenes strain, this strain was still unable to produce extracellular hyaluronidase, although intracellular hyaluronidase was present. These results, along with the absence of a typical N-terminal signal peptide, indicate that HylP 2 is unable to be secreted into the extracellular milieu. Examination of more than 100 strains for production of hyaluronidase showed that only 23 % of the strains produced extracellular hyaluronidase. One of these strains (strain 10403) contains a single bacteriophage hyaluronidase gene (hylP 2) which, when inactivated by allelic replacement, still produces large amounts of extracellular hyaluronidase. These results suggest the presence of a <b>different</b> hyaluronidase <b>gen...</b>|$|R

40|$|Higher {{education}} research on student retention and transition {{has been an}} ongoing focus since the 1950 s. During the past decade research into this area has gathered momentum as institutions of Higher Education increasingly recognise {{the economic and social}} costs of failing to retain and transition future graduates. Measures to improve transition and retention rates have generally focused on developing strategies to engage students in their studies and tertiary discourses by providing institutional, academic and/or social support. The success of these measures has varied across different institutions and <b>different</b> contexts. <b>Gen</b> Y students (those students born after 1980) not only provide a challenge to traditional higher education learning and teaching, but also provide a rich context for examining quality tertiary learning. Recent research suggests that this generation’s previous experiences of schooling have been characterised by teaching strategies that have favoured constant supervision, encouragement and support; approaches which historically have not been elemental to learning in Higher Education. In this paper I explore the relationship between the learning support provided by higher education institutions and Gen Y's perceived learning needs. This exploration is framed from within the complementary theoretical constructs of integration and adaptation transition discourses (Zepke, Leach, & Prebble, 2006). I argue that the presence of Gen Y in Higher Education offers an exciting opportunity for Higher Education to examine its current learning and teaching practices and to realign these in light of the realities of today’s young adult learner. I conclude that the best approach for meaningful Gen Y student engagement is one that amalgamates the transition strategies of integration and adaptation through recognising and responding to Gen Y’s particular learning characteristics and through supporting the direction of Higher Education learning support initiatives...|$|R

Introduction Biopesticides based on natural endophytic bacteria to control plant diseases are a promising ecological alternative to chemical treatments. Bacillus species produce {{a wide variety}} of metabolites with interesting biological activities, among them iturinic lipopep- tides antibiotics (Bottone and Peluso, 2003; Cho et al., 2003; Moyne et al., 2001). The antimicrobial activity exhibited by Bacillus sp. is dependent on the culture medium composition, and <b>different</b> nitro- <b>gen</b> sources can result in the production of different antibiotics (Besson et al., 1987; Chevanet et al., 1986; Davis et al., 1999; Volpon et al., 2000). Aspartic acid is the preferred nitrogen source for the production of iturinic compounds by Bacillus subtilis (Besson et al., 1987) and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (Caldeira et al., 2006, 2007, 2008). With increasing culture time, the nutrient content changes and adverse environmental conditions appear. Thus, incubation time is another factor influencing antibiotic production (Caldeira et al., 2008; Feio et al., 2004; Moyne et al., 2001), as the response to adverse environmental conditions can lead to activation of differ- ent mechanisms for the production of antibiotics giving a compet- itive advantage to the producer microorganism (Dieckmann et al., 2001).

All rights reserved. doi: 10. 1016 /j. biortech. 2010. 07. 080 abstract The combined effect of incubation time (IT) and aspartic acid concentration (AA) on the predicted bio- mass concentration (BC), Bacillus sporulation (BS) and anti-fungal activity of compounds (AFA) produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CCMI 1051, was studied using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The values predicted by ANN were in good agreement with experimental results, and were better than those obtained when using Response Surface Methodology. The database used to train and validate ANNs con- tains experimental data of B. amyloliquefaciens cultures (AFA, BS and BC) with different incubation times (1 – 9 days) using aspartic acid (3 – 42 mM) as nitrogen source. After the training and validation stages, the 2 – 7 - 6 – 3 neural network results showed that maximum AFA can be achieved with 19. 5 mM AA on day 9; however, maximum AFA can also be obtained with an incubation time as short as 6 days with 36. 6 mM AA.

Finally, a pro-duced antibody has to be purified to eliminate impurities like HCP or DNA. Therefore, efficiency of purification and generation of high producing cells is a key factor in the production of antibodies in science and industry. Additionally, the possibility of estimat-ing the antibody production of a cell would be high of value. In this work CHO-K 1 cells were transfected with four <b>different</b> vectors containing <b>gens</b> for expressing a human IgG 1, IgG 2, IgG 4 or a murine IgG 2 a. The productivity of the cells was compared with respect to the production of the different IgGs. The objective of this work was to deter-mine if the productivity of the cells is comparable for the four antibodies which were integrated into the same locus. Results indicated that the RMCE event was successful. However, the production of antibodies was too low to compare the productivity of the cells with respect to the four different classes of antibodies. Furthermore, CHO-DHFR-DG 44 cells of the Fraunhofer-Institute were transfected with a plasmid which encodes for GFP. The GFP encoding gen was integrated into the ge-nome of the cell randomly. The objective was to conduct a proof of principle that indi-cates if the cell line could be transfected with a gen of interest successfully. By sorting cells in a FACS, it was possible to isolate and to cultivate high producing cells. Finally, a low producing cell was cultivated over several weeks. In addition the purification of a monoclonal antibody was optimized in a two step purifi-cation process. The purification contained a capture step on MabSelect SuRe and a polishing step on Capto adhere. 96 Well PreDictor Plates were used in a high through-put process development (HTPD) to evaluate the best purification conditions.

Reading the {{creation}} narratives in Genesis 1 and 2, one encounters two totally different renditions. The two creation narratives agree that God created {{the universe and}} that God blesses his creation in abundance. But why did the Hebrews need two creation stories so <b>different</b> in style? <b>Gen.</b> 1 - 2 : 4 a seized my interest and I wanted to explore not only the milieu {{in which it was}} written, but also to read it against {{the creation}} narratives of the ancient Near East. The research was done religioushistorically. An insight had to be gained in the function and role of mythology within a cultural system and after distinguishing between folk sagas, legends and myths, different types of myths, as well as some perspectives on myths had to be investigated. Creation themes such as creation by birth, by struggle or victory, by action or activity as well as creation through the spoken word were encountered in the various creation narratives studied. Ancient Near East cosmogonies such as the variety of Egyptian cosmogonies, as well as Mesopotamian creation epics have been considered. Hittite myths were also considered, but here the result was the discovery of an extended pantheon with virtually no creation references. Thereafter I have concentrated on the cosmogony of the Hebrew Bible and the position, structure and understanding of Gen. 1 - 2 : 4 a. Most creation stories revert to bloody violence between the gods. The God of the Hebrews is a God of order – from chaos he creates more than order, he creates beauty. The subsequent survey of the conception of humankind in the near Ancient East, proved to be varied as well as interesting, some with remarkable parallels. My interest was extended to placing the creation narrative of Gen. 1 - 2 : 4 a in the modern era, by attempting to gain insight into the “Big Bang” theory, as well as Creationism and Evolution movements. Many motives were deducted by the research, but the idea of God creating in a “Godly” manner (bārā') and not merely give order to pre-created creations through struggle was unique. Human beings were created as the pinnacle of creation, and made to live in a relationship with their Creator...|$|R
