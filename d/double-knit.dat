2500|$|Disco fashions {{were very}} trendy {{in the late}} 1970s. Discothèque-goers often wore glamorous, {{expensive}} and extravagant fashions for nights out at their local disco club. Some women would wear sheer, flowing dresses, such as Halston dresses or loose, flared pants. Other women wore tight, revealing, sexy clothes, such as backless halter tops, [...] "hot pants" [...] or body-hugging spandex bodywear or [...] "catsuits". Men would wear shiny polyester Qiana shirts with colourful patterns and pointy, extra wide collars, preferably open at the chest. Men often wore Pierre Cardin suits, three piece suits with a vest and <b>double-knit</b> polyester shirt jackets with matching trousers known as the leisure suit. Men's leisure suits were typically form-fitted {{in some parts of}} the body, such as the waist and bottom, but the lower part of the pants were flared in a bell bottom style, to permit freedom of movement.|$|E
50|$|MLB jerseys worn on {{the field}} have been made out of <b>double-knit</b> {{polyester}} since the early 1970s. The Pittsburgh Pirates {{were the first to}} switch when the franchise opened Three Rivers Stadium following the 1970 All-Star Game. The Cardinals followed suit to open 1971, and the Orioles made a gradual change until adopting them full-time for that season's ALCS. In the World Series, Baltimore faced the original <b>double-knit</b> converts, the Pirates.|$|E
50|$|Sixteen teams debuted <b>double-knits</b> to open 1972; the Red Sox adopted {{them after}} the All-Star Game, and the Giants debuted {{them at home}} only at mid-season as well. The final flannel holdouts, the Expos, Royals and Yankees, {{converted}} to open 1973.|$|R
40|$|The {{alarming}} {{increase of}} incidence {{of skin cancer}} has hastened development of ultraviolet (UV) protective clothing and research on UV protection of apparel. Although various fabric parameters that affect ultraviolet radiation (UVR) transmission were studied by researches, most of them focused on woven fabrics and chemical approach in enhancing UV protection. There were few studies concerning knitted fabrics, in particular the influence of fabric constructions on ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) and structural properties. The magnitude of transmission and scattering of UVR through a fabric is decided by fabric construction or knit structure, which is classified by geometrical arrangement of yarns and fibers of the fabric. This paper aimed at studying the influence of different knit structures upon the UPF with the three main knit stitches incorporated in the knitted fabric constructions, namely the knit, tuck and miss stitches. The UPF and structural characteristics, including thickness, weight, stitch density and porosity of greige and bleached knitted fabrics with different knit structures, are compared by adopting factorial analysis of variance. The results show that fabrics with miss stitches possess a higher UPF than fabrics with tuck stitches. The <b>double-knitted</b> fabrics have better UV protection than the single-knitted fabrics overall, but bleaching has different impacts on the UPF of single- and <b>double-knitted</b> fabrics. The study reveals that fabric thickness or weight cannot be used solely in explaining the UV protective performance of knitted fabrics. However, fabric porosity {{can be a good}} indicator for UV protection when comparing fabrics with similar fabric weight and thickness but different structures or fiber contents.

50|$|In 1972, {{the uniform}} was {{modified}} by a {{change to the}} <b>double-knit</b> synthetic fabric (the <b>double-knit</b> fabric first came into use by the Pittsburgh Pirates two years earlier). The jerseys were now pullover style instead of button down and the trousers had a built in elastic belt replacing the standard leather belt and belt loops. Slightly more trim, {{in the form of}} narrow red and white bands, was added to the V-neck line, the cuff of the short sleeve, and the elastic belt. This uniform style carried the Reds through three more World Series appearances, in 1972, 1975, and 1976, the last two ending in championships for Cincinnati.|$|E
50|$|During the {{investigation}} {{the issue of}} the flammability of passengers' clothing materials was raised. There was evidence that passengers who wore <b>double-knit</b> synthetic fiber clothing articles sustained significantly worse burn injuries during the post-crash fire than passengers who wore articles made from natural fibers.|$|E
50|$|Major League Baseball {{teams had}} stopped wearing wool flannel jerseys by 1972. Teams now wear <b>double-knit</b> {{polyester}} jerseys. In a dusty warehouse in North Philadelphia, Mitchell & Ness discovered rolls of old baseball flannel from 50 years earlier. They were still carefully wrapped, untouched, and in like-new condition {{ready to be}} cut and sewn.|$|E
5000|$|Double {{knit fabric}} became popular within 1970s fashion; in the 1988 Grammy Award-winning song [...] "Parents Just Don't Understand", Will Smith comically excoriates his mother for {{forcing him to}} wear outdated, 1970s-era [...] "double-knit {{reversible}} slacks". However, the <b>double-knit</b> fabric referred to is a machine-made double-thick construction with some similarities to handmade double knitting (durability, reversibility) {{but none of the}} unique colorwork and construction possibilities.|$|E
5000|$|Qiana is a silky {{nylon fiber}} {{developed}} in 1962 at the DuPont Experimental Station by Stanley Brooke Speck. The fiber was named Qiana when introduced by DuPont in 1968. [...] Initially intended for high-end fashions, {{it became a}} popular material in the 1970s for faux-silk men's shirts, displaying bold patterns. The shirts were generally cut tight and included wide collars to fit over the collars of the <b>double-knit</b> suit coats which were worn popularly to discos.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{thicknesses}} of craft yarn, {{also referred to}} as weight. This is {{not to be confused with}} the measurement and/or weight listed above. The Craft Yarn Council of America is making an effort to promote a standardized industry system for measuring this, numbering the weights from 1 (finest) to 6 (heaviest). [...] Some of the names for the various weights of yarn from finest to thickest are called lace, fingering, sport, <b>double-knit</b> (or DK), worsted, aran (or heavy worsted), bulky, and super-bulky. This naming convention is more descriptive than precise; fibre artists disagree about where on the continuum each lies, and the precise relationships between the sizes.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is also a}} {{recurring}} [...] "chorus" [...] to the song, which appears four times. It is first sung as a lament {{of the man in}} the <b>double-knit</b> checkered suit when his car is destroyed. Moments later it is sung by Billy to announce his intentions of taking Ethel to Las Vegas. Just a few moments later it is sung again by Billy summing up the trip to Las Vegas using nearly the same lyrics as the previous chorus but in past tense. The chorus makes its final appearance {{at the end of the}} song as a third-person statement of the moral whereupon it is developed further and concludes with a reprise of the song's introduction.|$|E

5000|$|The Brewers {{finally got}} their own flannel design in 1971. This design was {{essentially}} the same as the one used in 1970, but with blue and yellow piping on the sleeves and collar. In 1972, the Brewers entered the <b>double-knit</b> era with uniforms based upon their flannels: all white with [...] "BREWERS" [...] on the front and blue and yellow trim on the sleeves, neck, waistband and {{down the side of the}} pants. This is the uniform that Hank Aaron wore with the club in his final seasons and that Robin Yount wore in his first. During this period, the logo of the club was the Beer Barrel Man, which had been used by the previous minor league Brewers since at least the 1940s. The Brewers mascot, Bernie Brewer (a man with a large yellow mustache wearing a Brewers hat) was introduced in 1973.|$|E
5000|$|The Toronto Blue Jays {{unveiled}} new uniforms on November 18, {{returning to}} a variation of their vintage logo used from 1977 through 1996. The new logo {{is similar to the}} original used from 1977-96, with a few exceptions: a more prominent maple leaf, a sleeker-looking blue jay, serifed modern lettering on the team name, and a split-line blue circle enclosing the logo. The new uniforms are similarly based on the set used from 1989-96; a white home uniform with [...] "Blue Jays", a grey road uniform with [...] "Toronto", and a blue alternate uniform with [...] "Blue Jays". The team/city name is arched above the secondary logo of the blue jay with the maple leaf, sans the baseball, situated on the left side. The secondary logo is also placed in the blue cap. The uniforms use the breathable <b>double-knit</b> polyester fabric, claiming the previously lighter Climate Base fabric became too heavy, once players began to sweat.|$|E
50|$|Slip {{stitches}} may be {{used for}} an easier method of double knitting that requires only one yarn be handled at one time. As a concrete example, consider a two-color pattern with a multiple of four stitches (labeled ABCD) being knit on double-pointed circular needles. On the first row, using color 1, stitch A is knitted, stitch B is purled, stitch C is slipped wyib and stitch D is slipped wyif. The knitter then slides the stitches back to the beginning (recall that the needles are double-pointed). Then, using color 2, stitch A is slipped wyib, stitch B is slipped wyif, stitch C is knitted and stitch D is purled. The knitter then turns the work and repeats indefinitely. The knitted and slipped wyib stitches come forward, whereas the purled and wyif stitches recede, resulting in a (very warm!) <b>double-knit</b> scarf alternating in the two colors with beautiful drape. The knit and purl stitches produce the front and back fabrics, respectively, of the double-knitted fabric while the slipped stitches allow for the alternation of color.|$|E
5000|$|From 1995, many of {{the songs}} that would {{eventually}} make it onto the debut album (Tee-Tot) were featured on compilations. Tee-Tot saw its first release on Hellnote Records in 1999. The album featured musical contributions from Sean Doe, Scorcho, Dino, Franco, Jacko, Chino, and Tony [...] "Gusto" [...] Portillo (drums). Supported by Tee-Tot, and bolstered by new rhythm guitarist A.J. [...] "King Taco Pearl" [...] Nesselrod, Throw Rag started building a wider fan base with their intense, maniacal live shows. Usually wearing a sea captain's hat and 70s <b>double-knit</b> suit, Sean Doe and Jacko (with {{nothing more than a}} wife beater and double knit pants) became notorious for stripping on stage. The band eventually started opening for acts such as Supersuckers, Green Day, Wesley Willis and Willie Nelson. In 2001, the band released a CD split with Supersuckers which featured a song that would later appear a Warped Tour 2002 Tour Compilation and their follow up album Desert Shores. Tee-Tot was only released in smaller record stores, and was available at live shows. Now out of print, Acetate plans to re-release the album in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Provisional cast-on : Also {{known as}} an [...] "invisible cast-on," [...] since the waste yarn used can be pulled out later to allow the knitter to {{continue}} the knitting in the opposite direction. This cast-on is also the best method for <b>double-knit</b> fabrics, since the knitting has no boundary; the knitting is continuous {{from one side of}} the fabric to the other. Holding the ends of a waste yarn and the working yarn, make an overhand knot. Place a needle held in the left hand between the two yarns, with the knot below, the waste yarn held underneath and parallel to the needle out to the right, and the working yarn up and in front of the needle. Bring the working yarn down behind the needle and in front of the waste yarn; up behind the waste yarn and over-and-up then down in front of the needle; down behind the waste yarn; then up in front of the needle. Repeat for each two stitches. When desired number of stitches is reached, loosely fasten the waste yarn and work as usual with the working yarn. To take out the provisional cast-on, unfasten the end of the waste yarn and carefully pull it out, picking up the now loose loops on a needle and working from the opposite direction of previous work.|$|E

The results showed that <b>double-knit</b> fabrics provide better UV protection than single-knit fabrics. School of Desig...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find the balance between teams and {{communities}} of practice in knowledge management. Lopez-Nicolas and Meroño-Cerdán (2009) among others, state that knowledge management is source of sustainable competitive advantage for firms. However McDermott and Wenger argue that to leverage knowledge, organisations need both teams and communities of practice. Communities of practices are informal, self-organising sub-organisational units where employees meet like minded people to discuss and exchange knowledge. Scholars argue that to create knowledge, especially tacit knowledge, communities of practice are more effective than teams. Therefore teams should be used for implementing knowledge while communities are to be used for creating knowledge. A case study company was used to investigate these issues. The case company is a project management consultancy company; the largest of its kind in the Scandinavia. The investigative methods employed were semi-structured interviews of the company employees, documents and website analysis and observation of the company culture. The organisation had just recently formally recognised communities of practice that exist within the company. The company supports communities of practice through encouraging social gatherings of employees, weekly discursive meetings and providing enabling technology for collaboration among employees that a spatially separated. Team managers can also spend up to 10 % of their time in team development activities. Using Wenger (1998) ’s typology on communities of teams, it was the conclusion of this study that the case company’s communities of practice have recently transitioned from bootlegged to legitimised. It was also concluded that the existence of both teams and communities of practice in the company places it in a good position to develop into what McDermott terms a <b>double-knit</b> organisation.

40|$|AbstractThere {{are several}} issues and {{challenges}} related to forming and implementing knowledge management initiatives in project-based organisations {{in such a way}} to promote knowledge sharing, learning, innovation, organisation development. One such issue is to identify proper organisational structure(s) that can support and facilitate learning and development. There are 2 commonly used organisational structures. They are formal work-teams and (informal) communities of practice (CoP). Organisations, in general, have and/or need both the formal and informal structures. The challenge that several organizations have is how to combine formal work-teams and CoP – How to find a balance between them?This paper will look at a Scandinavian project-based organisation, and describe what this organisation has done in order to accomplish the balance. In this regard, the paper will focus on how the organisation deals with its organisational structure in such a way to facilitate learning and knowledge sharing; how it utilizes both formal teams and CoP in this process, and the challenges and opportunities that are associated with this process. This paper is based on the study whose objective was to see how a Scandinavian project-based organisation transformed itself into a <b>double-knit</b> organisation – effectively using both formal and informal structures to improve its work-performance. The study used a qualitative research method; a case study that incorporated interviews (semi-structures interviews), observations and document analysis. At the start of the study, the organisation was transforming its ‘below the radar’ CoP into recognised structures within the organisation. Hence, the situation offered an opportunity to study the actual transition process. Findings of the study discuss among other things, the organisation's formalization of (previously informal) team leadership positions, incorporating members of CoP in the advisory board and leadership roles, and formalising CoP, {{while at the same time}} strengthening formal structures such as formal teams. The organisation used social settings to encourage interaction among employees. The major findings were that for <b>double-knit</b> organisation to effectively work, there is a need to balance organic, informal settings (CoP) and formal teams. The study confirmed previous findings that tacit knowledge plays a very significant role in knowledge transfer in project-based organisations. The study also showed that while formal teams were easier to create and define scope for them, the same could not be said about CoP. CoP were unpredictable and seemed to work better independent of the organisational leaders’ interference. However, they were promoted by employee interactions. As practical implications, the findings presented in this paper can be considered as suggestions – or, at least as focal points for reflection – for other project-based organisations to strengthen their knowledge management practices in order to obtain better results...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The major {{purposes}} of the research were {{to determine whether there}} were significant differences in breaking strength and elongation of the following types of seams in a polyester <b>double-knit</b> fabric: 1. seams stitched with threads of (a) mercerized cotton, (b) core-spun polyester/cotton, and (c) bonded nylon monocord. 2. seams stitched with (a) a narrow zigzag stitch, (b) a lockstitch made while stretching the fabric, and (c) an elastic straight stitch. 3. seams stitched (a) parallel to the wales and (b) parallel to the courses. 4. seams stitched with settings of (a) 9 stitches per inch, (b) 12 stitches per inch, and (c) 15 stitches per inch. Results indicated that the polyester/cotton core-spun thread produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than mercerized cotton thread for all comparable sets of specimens. Seams constructed with polyester/cotton core-spun thread also tended to exhibit greater seam breaking strength and elongation than those seamed with bonded nylon monocord thread. The nylon thread, in turn, tended to produce stronger and more extensible seams than did mercerized cotton thread. The elastic straight stitch (a triple lockstitch) produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than either of the other stitch types. Most seams stitched with the lockstitch with stretch had a higher mean seam breaking strength and elongation than comparable seams stitched with the zigzag stitch, Stitch length affected seam breaking strength and elongation to a greater extent with the zigzag than with the lockstitch with stretch. For most comparable sets of zigzag specimens, increases in the number of stitches per inch were accompanied by increases in seam breaking strength and elongation. With the lockstitch, those differences which were significant indicated that the shorter stitches were related to greater breaking strength and elongation. Seams parallel to the courses were related to greater seam breaking strength and elongation than seams parallel to the wales...|$|E
