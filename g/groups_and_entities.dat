30|$|In {{the face}} of the {{changing}} climate and realizing the consequent adverse effects, rural communities in Afar continue applying a number of adaptation methods provided that they expect benefits out of their adaptation actions (Di Falco et al. 2011, 2012; Kato et al. 2011). In this section, we examine the linkages between various types of adaptation measures and their corresponding effects on the income of pastoral, semi-pastoral, agro-pastoral and mixed-farming communities in the Afar region. Prior to estimations, we conducted several tests to verify which model was appropriately needed for doing the analysis. As individual sampled households were proportionally drawn from the four types of communities, estimation of adaptation effects on income of households necessitates considering two key potential sources of variation, which means at both individual and group levels. While estimation using ordinary least square (OLS) is useful to capture individual variations, random effects model incorporates non-systematic variances across <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>entities.</b> Thus, mixed OLS-random effects test allows distinguishing what proportion of the variance in income can be attributed by individual differences compared to group differences arising from the four communities (see Appendix  1).|$|E
40|$|The State of Texas {{currently}} contains 568 water bodies considered impaired due {{to excessive}} pollutant loading. Of these, approximately 48 % are impaired due to {{elevated levels of}} fecal indicator bacteria from animals, birds and humans. Once impaired, efforts to restore water quality must be undertaken. This large number of bacteria impairments leaves the State with a sizable task ahead and presents a range of restoration challenges. Restoring all of these impaired water bodies is costly and resource intensive, thus prioritizing future water quality restoration efforts is a means to efficiently allocate available resources and achieve timely restoration results. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed the Recovery Potential Screening (RPS) tool to help prioritize water body restoration planning efforts (Norton et al. 2009). Built as a technical aid for states and government agencies, the RPS tool provides a systematic approach for comparing the relative restorability of water bodies.

Indeed, issues relating to its ways and means, conceptual and operational problems, and best practices have occupied the attention of many practitioners, and cringed the brows of many of scholars, for a fairly long time. However, recent years have witnessed an increased deployment of IHRFF in response to alleged violations of human rights in a range of climes. This may be a possible justification for the renewed attention that it appears to receiving among academics and practitioners alike. In particular, given the increasing salience of IHRFF and the tremendous power that its practitioners can increasingly exert in both domestic and world affairs, contemporary scholarly commentators appear to be justified in renewing their quest to understand IHRFF and, if necessary, stimulate its thoughtful reform. This article is a modest attempt to contribute to the emergent process of the renewed study of that praxis...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{proposition}} that leasing is environmentally superior to selling, some firms have adopted a leasing strategy and others promote their existing leasing programs as environmentally superior to "green" their image. The argument is that because a leasing firm retains ownership of the off-lease units, it has an incentive to remarket them or invest in designing a more durable product, resulting in a lower volume of new production and disposal. However, leasing might be environmentally inferior because of the direct control the firm has over the off-lease products, which may prompt the firm to remove them from the market to avoid cannibalizing the demand for new products. Motivated by these issues, we adopt a life-cycle environmental impact perspective and analytically investigate if leasing can be both more profitable and have a lower total environmental impact. We find that leasing can be environmentally worse despite remarketing all off-lease products and greener than selling despite the mid-life removal of off-lease products. Our analysis also provides insights for environmental <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>entities</b> that use different approaches to improve the environmental performance of business practices. We show that imposing disposal fees or encouraging remanufacturing, under some conditions, can actually lead to higher environmental impact. We also identify when educating consumers to be more environmentally conscious can improve the relative environmental performance of leasing...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 26) In {{the twenty}} first century scientific discoveries are accumulating at an incredible rate. This period of rapid discovery effects the invention and re-invention {{of technology and}} society at large. The staggering amount of information available requires the ability to filter it in an intelligible and useful way. This complexity has led invention away from the rogue genus inventor of {{the early twentieth century}} such as Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. Such invention and development now lends itself to larger <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>entities</b> with a myriad of specialized skills and infrastructure. The works in Mechta are an attempt to explore, both visually and conceptually, topics related to invention and scientific discovery. These works consider topics both current and historical with the unifying theme of being topics which I do not completely grasp at the outset of each individual work. There are no scientific discoveries or inventions; there is only evidence of my process of investigation. Sometimes this is revealed by way my understanding a scientific topic more thoroughly and other times the resulting works show evidence of only the process of investigation which can lead to greater confusion or misunderstanding. Ultimately Mechta is my attempt to comprehend and address topics in science which are not completely within my ability to comprehend.

40|$|The article {{outlines}} {{an integrated}} theoretical framework identifying the causal processes underlying formation, growth, and adap-tive change in marketing systems. Beginning with the co-evolution of behaviors, beliefs, and social practices that initiate innovative change in marketing systems, it integrates three theoretical frameworks drawn from analytical sociology, organization and social movement theory, and from macromarketing {{to show how}} and why economic exchange in and between human communities leads to formation, growth, and adaptive change in marketing systems. The theory of social mechanisms identifies the means whereby actions taken by individuals and entities participating in a marketing system will regularly produce over time the collec-tive outcomes that characterize a marketing system. The theory of strategic action fields explains how these actions, engendered by competition between participants for material and status rewards in the social action field associated with a marketing system, lead to internal and external change in a marketing system. The theory of marketing systems identifies the tangible and intangible elements of structure and function in marketing systems that emerge from the interaction of social mechanisms and action fields over time and that are found in every human community. As marketing systems form, grow, and change they {{become part of the}} immediate environment in turn influencing the actions of individuals, <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>entities,</b> as well as adjacent marketing systems, shaping on-going co-evolution, the operation of social mechanisms, and the strategic choices made by actors in action fields. The Mechanism, Action, Structure (MAS) framework of theory is dynamic, explores causation, links micro choices and macro struc-tures, focusses on processes rather than variables, and links macromarketing with cognate social sciences in an understanding of economic exchange in human communities...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{effective}} multi-level governance arrangements {{is becoming increasingly}} apparent {{because of the high}} functional interdependencies between biophysical and socioeconomic factors in the realm of natural resource governance. Such arrangements provide a basis for the exchange, discussion, and deliberation of information, knowledge, and data across diverse user <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>entities.</b> Multi-level governance is operationalized by using a microinstitutional analysis that links decision-making arenas across three distinct levels: operational, collective-choice, and constitutional. Within this context, I argue that the effectiveness and success of actors' participatory processes across these three levels depend on the amount of social capital among actors within the governance system. I assessed the concept of social capital using two different models: (1) a structural approach focused on resources embedded within an individual's network, and (2) a combined structural-cultural approach that incorporates various aspects of group membership with relations of trust, rules, and norms. To explore the effects of social capital on participatory processes related to the implementation and management of natural resources, I analyzed different small-scale fisheries governance regimes from the Gulf of California, Mexico. I collected data using surveys (n= 371), interviews (n= 82), and participant observation techniques conducted among the residents of four small-scale fishing communities that live adjacent to marine protected areas along the Baja California, Mexico, peninsula. Data analysis included both quantitative (logit regression model), and qualitative (narrative analysis) approaches. Overall, my results suggest that both social capital models reveal the multidimensional nature of social capital where none of its individual types form a consistent and statistically significant relationship with the six outcomes that I measured. However, these types are related in different ways to fishers engagement in participatory processess across the three levels. The extent of fishers' engagement in participatory processess across different levels was not high. Qualitative analysis revealed that participatory processes related to fisheries conservation and management, although present do not reach their full potential and are stymied by a historical context and a lack of general participatory culture.

40|$|In March 23, 2010, President Obama {{signed into}} law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), which {{included}} several provisions intended to improve the health of Americans and prevent the onset of preventable chronic disease conditions. Section 4103 of the ACA, entitled Medicare Coverage of Annual Wellness Visit Providing a Personalized Prevention Plan, mandates that starting in January 1, 2011, Medicare will cover, without cost to beneficiaries, an annual wellness visit (AWV) that includes a health risk assessment (HRA) followed by provision of a customized wellness or personal prevention plan. Section 4103 also states that an HRA is to be completed prior to, or as part of, a visit with a health professional who may be a physician, medical practitioner, medical professional (e. g., health educator, registered dietician, nutrition professional) or a team of medical professionals. The law specifies that the HRA 1) must identify chronic diseases, injury risks, modifiable risk factors, and urgent health needs of an individual; 2) may be furnished through an interactive telephonic or web-based program; 3) may be offered during the encounter with a health care professional or through community-based prevention programs, or 4) may be provided through any other means appropriate to maximize accessibility {{and ease of use}} by beneficiaries, while ensuring the privacy of beneficiaries. Other provisions of Section 4103 include 1) establishing standards for interactive or Web-based programs used to furnish HRAs, and 2) determining ways of using the HRA in the formulation of a personalized prevention plan for beneficiaries who are administered the HRA. The law also calls for making available to the public an HRA 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 model 22 ̆ 0 ac? (unspecified) 18 months after the passage of ACA, ensuring that HRAs are made available and easily accessible to beneficiaries, providing support to those wishing to complete HRAs, and publicizing the requirement that beneficiaries complete an HRA prior to, or concurrent with, receiving personalized prevention plan services. The statute recognizes the critical nature of follow-up services by encouraging integration of HRAs with health information technology (HIT), including electronic medical record (EMRs) and personal health records (PHRs), and the leveraging of these technologies in the development of self-management skills and management of, and adherence to, provider recommendations as a means of improving the health of beneficiaries. Further, as part of the law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to establish publicly available guidelines for an HRA, to be formulated in consultation with relevant <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>entities.</b> With this as background, the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contracted with Partnership for Prevention and its subcontractor Thomson Reuters to develop this guidance document to be used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to direct health care providers, health promotion vendors, and other professionals wishing to implement Section 4103 of the ACA. The guidance document presented here is informed by interviews with subject matter experts, input received in response to a Federal Register Notice, insights provided by attendees at a public forum hosted by the CDC on February 122 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2, 2011, and knowledge by the authors derived from an understanding of the literature focused on this topic (see Appendix B).
