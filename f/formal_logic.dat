5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view of {{language}} have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements {{and then by}} presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature {{of the human mind}} and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in <b>formal</b> <b>logic,</b> in formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.|$|E

25|$|<b>Formal</b> <b>logic</b> is {{the study}} of {{inference}} with purely formal content. An inference possesses a purely formal content if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule, that is, a rule that is not about any particular thing or property. The works of Aristotle contain the earliest known formal study of logic. Modern <b>formal</b> <b>logic</b> follows and expands on Aristotle. In many definitions of logic, logical inference and inference with purely formal content are the same. This does not render the notion of informal logic vacuous, because no <b>formal</b> <b>logic</b> captures all of the nuances of natural language.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The BDI {{architecture}} {{is one of}} the most popular archi-tectures for agents with symbolic reasoning capabilities. To formally define the notions of Beliefs, Desires and Intentions, different <b>formal</b> <b>logics</b> have been proposed in the literature.

What is lacking, is a proper characterization of the agent’s behavior. The <b>formal</b> <b>logics</b> proposed so far, do not allow for an adequate charac-terization of the refinement of behaviors that Bratman describes.
