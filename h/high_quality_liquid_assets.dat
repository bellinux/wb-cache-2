As a result of these actions UK banks have raised over a £130bn of new capital and now have more than £600bn of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>assets.</b> That substantial capital and huge liquidity gives banks the flexibility they need to continue to lend to UK businesses and households even during challenging times.Moreover, as a backstop to support the functioning of the markets the Bank of England stands ready to provide more than £250bn of additional funds through its normal market operations.

Alternate fuels were defined to be combinations of {{a large percentage of}} viscous, low volatility fuels resulting from the low end of distillation mixed with a small percentage of relatively low viscosity, high volatility fuels yielded by the high end of distillation. The addition of high volatility fuels was meant to promote desirable characteristics to a fuel that would otherwise be difficult to atomize and burn and whose combustion would yield a high amount of pollutants. Several questions thus needed to be answered before alternate fuels became commercially viable.

50|$|One of {{the primary}} {{limitations}} of supported bilayers {{is the possibility of}} unwanted interactions with the substrate. Although supported bilayers generally do not directly touch the substrate surface, they are separated by only a very thin water gap. The size and nature of this gap depends on the substrate material and lipid species but is generally about 1 nm for zwitterionic lipids supported on silica, the most common experimental system. Because this layer is so thin there is extensive hydrodynamic coupling between the bilayer and the substrate, resulting in a lower diffusion coefficient in supported bilayers than for free bilayers of the same composition. A certain percentage of the supported bilayer will also be completely immobile, although the exact nature of and reason for these “pinned” sites is still uncertain. For <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>liquid</b> phase supported bilayers the immobile fraction is typically around 1-5%.

40|$|The paper elicits a {{mechanism}} by which private leverage choices exhibit strategic complementarities through the reaction of monetary policy.

The ex post benefits from a monetary bailout accrue {{in proportion to the}} number amount of leverage, while the distortion costs are to a large extent fixed. This insight has important consequences. First, banks choose to correlate their risk exposures.

40|$|Anthropogenic climate change, caused {{primarily}} by excessive {{emissions of carbon}} dioxide, {{has led to a}} renewed interest in char, the solid product of pyrolysis. When applied to soil as biochar it can both sequester carbon and improve soil function. To make its manufacture environmentally friendly and economically viable it is important to maximise char yield, which can be done by promoting secondary reactions. This research shows that secondary reactions, which are enhanced by prolonged vapour-phase residence time and concentration, not only increase the char yield but are the source {{of the majority of the}} char formed. All four biomass constituents (extractives, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) undergo secondary reactions concurrent with primary reactions over the entire pyrolysis range ≈ 140 to 500 °C, which makes it practically impossible to separate them. Secondary char formation was confirmed to be exothermic which affects the overall heat of pyrolysis. Impregnating the feedstock with the elements K, Mg and P, which are plant macro-nutrients naturally present in biomass, resulted in the catalysis of secondary char formation. The results reveal that a first order reaction model does not describe pyrolysis accurately when char formation is enhanced by catalysis and secondary reactions. Secondary char can be enhanced by increasing the particle size but there is a limit due to increased cracking and fracturing of the pyrolysing solid. This limitation is overcome by pyrolysis in an enclosed vessel, termed autogenous pressure pyrolysis, which was discovered to cause significant changes in the volatile pyrolysis products; indicating the co-production of a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>liquid.</b> This process, however, negatively affects the char properties relevant for biochar like the surface area, similar to self-charring and co-carbonisation of condensed volatile pyrolysis products.

Today, a large {{proportion}} of the world's plenteous offshore natural gas resource are stranded, flared or re-injected due to constraints pertaining to its utilisation. The major constraint in the utilisation of this resource is linked to its properties, which makes it difficult to transport or store. Although the resource presents an excellent opportunity for the Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) technology (process for converting natural gas into high energy <b>liquid</b> fuels with <b>qualities</b> that surpass the most stringent current and future clean-fuel requirements), the further processing of this resource is still impeded by high cost of transportation. However, it is believed that the emerging Floating GTL concept could offer superb opportunities to bring such offshore stranded natural gas reserves to markets by converting the gas into <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>liquid</b> fuels, at the production sites, before it is transported using conventional oil tankers or vessels. But the question is: can this venture be profitable or economically viable? In response, an Economic Model (the EV Model) to review the economic viability of the Floating GTL option was developed. Analyses on technical and economical aspects of the floating GTL application offshore are presented with case studies on Syntroleum's and Statoil's floating GTL designs. Profitability analyses were conducted using the EV model to evaluate economic parameters such as Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Discounted PayBack Period (DPBP), Profitability index (PI), Break-Even Analysis (BEA) and Scale Economies for some assumed case scenarios involving both designs. In addition, sensitivity analyses were also carried out to find the most sensitive parameters which affect the viability of the floating GTL option. The economic analyses revealed that, a modest feedstock cost (~ 0 - $ 3 /MSCF), high crude oil price (that stays above $ 30 per barrel) and reduction trend in capital expenditure (for stand alone Floating GTL plant) up to $ 20, 00 O/BPD or lower in the next few years, will open windows for the floating GTL concept. Finally, the energy policy needed to achieve the capitalisation of the plenteous offshore stranded gas resource via floating GTL is also discussed. Master...|$|R
