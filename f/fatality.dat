500|$|<b>Fatalities</b> in {{football}} are rare. A 2013 study {{of high school}} and college football players split <b>fatalities</b> into two types: direct <b>fatalities,</b> defined as those caused by [...] "trauma from participation in a sport resulting in a brain injury, cervical fracture, or intra-abdominal injury" [...] and indirect <b>fatalities,</b> defined as those resulting from external factors such as [...] "cardiac failure, heat illness, sickle cell trait , asthma, or pulmonary embolism".

5|$|In 1624, a <b>fatality</b> {{occurred}} {{following a}} match on Saturday, 28 August, at Horsted Keynes, now in East Sussex. A fielder called Jasper Vinall was struck {{on the head}} by the batsman, Edward Tye, {{who was trying to}} hit the ball a second time to avoid being caught. Vinall, who died thirteen days later at home in West Hoathly, is thus the earliest recorded cricketing <b>fatality.</b> The matter was recorded in a coroner's court, which returned a verdict of death by misadventure. The tragedy was repeated in 1647 when another <b>fatality</b> was recorded at Selsey, now in West Sussex, a player called Henry Brand being hit on the head by a batsman trying to hit the ball a second time. When the first Laws of Cricket were encoded in 1744, it was illegal to hit the ball twice and a batsman breaking the rule was to be given out. The record of the 1624 case confirms that two villages, Horsted Keynes and West Hoathly, were involved in the match and provides further evidence of the growth of village cricket.|$|E

There were 9 <b>fatalities</b> of women (including 4 bystanders). > Five industries accounted for seven out of every ten notified work-related <b>fatalities</b> — 23 % of <b>fatalities</b> occurred at a workplace primarily engaged in Agriculture, forestry & fishing; 17 % in Construction; 13 % in Manufacturing; 11 % in Transport & storage; and 5 % in Mining. > The most common causes of the <b>fatalities</b> were Vehicle incidents (26 fatalities); Falls from a height (20); Being hit by falling objects (18); Being hit by moving objects (18); and Contact with electricity (12). > Of the 26 <b>fatalities</b> caused by Vehicle incidents, 10 <b>fatalities</b> occurred on public roads and 16 occurred elsewhere, including 6 <b>fatalities</b> during air travel. Since work-related traffic <b>fatalities</b> on public roads are usually investigated {{by the police and}} incidents involving aircraft are usually investigated by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau they are not generally notifiable to work health and safety jurisdictions.

40|$|The {{researchers}} examined {{an economic}} behavior {{model of the}} evacuation decision. Hurricane <b>fatalities</b> decreased each decade until the 2000 s, when deaths increased due to Hurricane Katrina. As more people move into coastal region, {{we need a new}} look at the cost of evacuation compared to the value of waiting. For mitigation and minimization of <b>fatalities,</b> the researchers examined the creation of an Ike dike that costs $ 40 million and questioned its value. The researchers modeled <b>fatalities</b> as related to the direct and indirect factors of storm characteristics, socioeconomic factors, forecasting technology, evacuation, and time. Most research is focused on coastal counties, but deaths often occur inland. For Floyd, of the 70 <b>fatalities,</b> only three were direct coastal <b>fatalities.</b> The researchers compared deaths from different storms, 93 % with zero <b>fatalities.</b> They found a lowering of <b>fatalities</b> over time and high levels of evacuations. As evacuation levels rise, there were less <b>fatalities.</b> If there was no evacuation for Hurricane Andrew, the model predicted ten additional deaths. Early storms cause more <b>fatalities,</b> and fewer <b>fatalities</b> occur among people with higher median incomes. As forecast error is worsens, expected <b>fatalities</b> decrease because more people are warned and are better prepared. Although this research focused on the coastal region, an important extension would be to look at inland communities and compare with rainfall data...|$|R

Among the prisoners was Goran Hadžić, later to become the President of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, although he was quickly released. Hadžić's release was explained as a goodwill gesture by the authorities, but Boljkovac claims he was released because he was collaborating with the Croatian authorities in 1991.

This effect is temporary, however, and vanishes completely within 90 days. We also find some evidence that Palestinian <b>fatalities</b> lead to the polarization of the population and to increased disaffection and a lack of support for any faction. Geographically proximate Palestinian <b>fatalities</b> have a larger effect than those that are distant, while Palestinian <b>fatalities</b> in targeted killings have a smaller effect relative to other <b>fatalities.</b> Although overall Israeli <b>fatalities</b> do not seem to affect Palestinian public opinion, when we divide those <b>fatalities</b> by the different factions claiming responsibility for them, we find some evidence that increased Israeli <b>fatalities</b> are effective in increasing support for the faction that claimed them...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{examined}} whether neighborhood social characteristics (income {{distribution and}} family fragmentation) and physical characteristics (clean sidewalks and dilapidated housing) {{were associated with}} the risk of <b>fatalities</b> caused by analgesic overdose. MethodsIn a case-control study, we compared 447 unintentional analgesic opioid overdose <b>fatalities</b> (cases) with 3436 unintentional nonoverdose <b>fatalities</b> and 2530 heroin overdose <b>fatalities</b> (controls) occurring in 59 New York City neighborhoods between 2000 and 2006. ResultsAnalgesic overdose <b>fatalities</b> were less likely than nonoverdose unintentional <b>fatalities</b> to have occurred in higher-income neighborhoods (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 82; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 70, 0. 96) and more likely to have occurred in fragmented neighborhoods (OR = 1. 35; 95 % CI = 1. 05, 1. 72). They were more likely than heroin overdose <b>fatalities</b> to have occurred in higher-income (OR = 1. 31; 95 % CI = 1. 12, 1. 54) and less fragmented (OR = 0. 71; 95 % CI = 0. 55, 0. 92) neighborhoods. ConclusionsAnalgesic overdose <b>fatalities</b> exhibit spatial patterns that are distinct from those of heroin and nonoverdose unintentional <b>fatalities.</b> Whereas analgesic <b>fatalities</b> typically occur in lower-income, more fragmented neighborhoods than nonoverdose <b>fatalities,</b> they tend to occur in higher-income, less unequal, and less fragmented neighborhoods than heroin <b>fatalities.</b> 1 R 49 CE 002096 - 01 /CE/NCIPC CDC HHS/United States 1 K 01 DA 030449 - 01 /DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United StatesDA 06534 /DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United StatesK 01 DA 030449 /DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States 2014 - 02 - 10 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 24134362 PMC 382896...|$|R
