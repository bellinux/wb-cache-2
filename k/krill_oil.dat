50|$|Research {{regarding}} <b>krill</b> <b>oil,</b> another animal-based omega-3 source, is ongoing. Preliminary studies {{appear to}} indicate that the DHA and EPA omega-3 fatty acids found in <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> may be more bio-available than in fish oil. Additionally, <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> contains astaxanthin, a marine-source keto-carotenoid antioxidant that may act synergistically with EPA and DHA.|$|E
50|$|The chick is fed by both parents. Chicks are fed on fish, squid, <b>krill,</b> {{and stomach}} <b>oil.</b> Stomach oil is oil {{composed}} of neutral dietary lipids {{that are the}} residue created by digestion of the prey items. As an energy source for chicks it has several advantages over undigested prey, its calorific value is around 9.6 kcal per gram, which is only slightly lower than the value for diesel oil. This {{can be a real}} advantage for species that range over huge distances to provide food for hungry chicks. The oil is also used in defence. All Procellariiformes create stomach oil except the diving-petrels.|$|R
30|$|Although lipids {{have often}} been condemned, the use of lipid and its {{products}} has drawn a dramatic interest in recent years due to findings related to their effects on human health. Apart from enhancing flavor, texture, and mouthfeel to foods, lipids also provide essential fatty acids [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid (AA), and γ-linolenic acid], fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), and other minor components (phospholipids, tocopherols, tocotrienols, carotenoids, sterols, and phenolic compounds) (Rizliya and Mendis 2014; Shahidi 2006). Particularly, the roles of carotenoids, EPA, and/or DHA in heart health, mental health, brain, and retina development, have been well documented (Alabdulkarim et al. 2012; Guerin et al. 2003; Swanson et al. 2012; Yamashita 2013), and such lipid constituents have been regconized as nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals for improving human health. By this reason, fish oils {{have been used for}} enriching DHA and EPA of many food products such as powder milk formulate, salad oil, fruit beverage, vegetable juice (Kolanowski and Berger 1999), dairy products (Kolanowski and Weißbrodt 2007), soft goat cheese (Hughes et al. 2012), or cookies (Jeyakumari et al. 2016). Lobster oils have a potential use as a source of natural ω- 3 fatty acids for many fortified products since they have been demonstrated to contain PUFAs and ω- 3 fatty acids as high as that of fish <b>oil</b> (menhaden) or <b>krill</b> <b>oils</b> (Albalat et al. 2016; Tsvetnenko et al. 1996). Moreover, higher bioavailability of fatty acids derived from crustacean oils compared to those of fish oils (Köhler et al. 2015) together with the antioxidant superior of crustacean oils provided by carotenoids make them ideal for application as a novel and beneficial food ingredient (Tetens 2009) or as oil supplement (Köhler et al. 2015). With a significant richness in astaxanthin, PUFAs, and ω- 3 fatty acids, lobster oil was suggested for use as a dietary supplement (Nguyen 2017) since oils produced from fish livers are often considered as an important source of vitamins A and D with several therapeutic properties (Gunstone 2006; Rizliya and Mendis 2014). In addition, lobster liver oil contains very strong specific flavors, which combined with the unique and inherent ability of oils for absorbing and preserving flavors, would be a promising application for flavor industry. For this reason, lobster lipids were investigated for production of infused lobster oil, salt plated with lobster flavors, and lobster seasoning, and they obtained promising results (Nguyen 2017).|$|R
40|$|The general {{population}} {{is encouraged to}} increase omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n- 3 PUFA) intake in order to optimize health for preventative health care. Consumers are typically unaware that different amounts, types, and structural forms of n- 3 PUFA have different efficacy. Therefore, the objectives {{of this study were}} to characterize different sources of n- 3 PUFAs and to determine whether consumption of these oils influences renal fatty acid composition and renal health. Lipid classes and fatty acid profile of corn (CO), flaxseed (FO), menhaden (MO), salmon (SO), tuna (TO) or <b>krill</b> (KO) <b>oils</b> were determined by thin-layer and gas chromatography. All dietary oils consisted of > 65 % triglyceride with the exception of KO. KO and FO also contained phospholipids. FO was rich in the n- 3 PUFA, alpha-linolenic acid (18 : 3 n- 3) whereas, the marine oils were rich in the long-chain n- 3 PUFAs (> 18 carbons). Following characterization of the oil sources, female Sprague-Dawley rats (age 28 d) were randomly assigned (n = 10 /group) to be fed a high fat 12 % (wt) diet consisting of these different oil sources for 8 weeks. Rats fed MO, TO, and SO had significantly higher renal eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6 n- 3) deposition and this in turn, modulated inflammatory responses. Feeding rats MO, SO and TO reduced urinary excretion of 13, 14 -dihydro- 15 -keto prostaglandin E 2. Feeding rats TO and SO reduced (P ≤ 0. 002) nuclear factor kappa B activity and circulating TNF α (P P P < 0. 001) urinary phosphorus excretion associated with the phospholipids content of KO. The study results indicated that consumption of n- 3 PUFAs influences renal health and the effects varied depending on the n- 3 PUFA source consumed. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{limited amount}} of fish oils {{available}} has led to extensive search for alternative sources of oils rich in health beneficial long-chain polyunsaturated ω- 3 fatty acids. The zooplankton Calanus finmarchicus, also known as redfeed, is present in large amounts in the North Atlantic and has lipid-rich stages, which can be harvested. One of the main objectives {{of this study was}} to investigate if the use of proteolytic enzymes could improve oil recovery from C. finmarchicus in an industrial-like process, and to characterize the oil obtained. The results showed a substantially higher oil yield with the use of proteolytic enzymes compared to standard fish oil production technology. The oil from C. finmarchicus was rich in the powerful antioxidant astaxanthin and had a high content of the ω- 3 fatty acids, mainly found as wax esters. The wax ester rich oil is well utilized by fish, and recent reports indicate that Calanus oil may have beneficial health effects beyond those, which may be ascribed to intake of ω- 3 fatty acids alone. Tropomyosin is known to be the main allergen in crustaceans and another objective was to investigate if this protein could be detected in <b>Krill</b> and Calanus <b>oils.</b> Tropomyosin was not detected in Calanus oil probably due the production method. A method for accurate determination of the protein content in oils by direct amino acid analysis was also developed...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of feeding duration and tissue type on fatty acid (FA) deposition in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) tissues was investigated {{to establish the}} appropriate foundation for quantitative estimates of diet in wild fish. Fish were adapted to seawater and were fed one of four formulated diets based on <b>krill</b> or herring <b>oil</b> for 22 weeks. After 12 weeks of feeding, proportions of most FA in both belly flap and muscle tissues of salmon had changed substantially to resemble dietary FA proportions, showing little variation after an additional 10 weeks of feeding. However, tissues showed a differential response to diets, depending on the proportions of dietary FA. When present in large proportions in the diet, FA, including 18 : 2 n- 6 and monounsaturated FA, seemed to be selectively catabolized; when present in low proportions, selective retention in tissues occurred. Proportions of the polyunsaturated FA, 20 : 5 n- 3 and 22 : 6 n- 3, in tissues also varied with diet {{but not in a}} predictable manner related to dietary FA proportions. Further, the response to a change in the FA profile of diet was not equal for both tissues with belly flap tissue developing a FA signature that was more similar to the diet than muscle tissue. These results suggest that fish may represent a more complex study species than marine mammals for quantitative estimation of diet using FA. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of carotenoids in animal tissue reflects their sources along the food chain. Astaxanthin, the main carotenoid used for salmonid pigmentation, is usually {{included in the}} feed as a synthetic product. However, other dietary sources of astaxanthin such as shrimp or krill wastes, algae meal or yeasts are also available on the market. Astaxanthin possesses two identical asymmetric atoms at C- 3 and C- 32 ̆ 7 making possible three optical isomers with all-trans configuration of the chain: 3 S, 32 ̆ 7 S, 3 R, 32 ̆ 7 S, and 3 R, 32 ̆ 7 R. The distribution of the isomers in natural astaxanthin {{differs from that of}} the synthetic product. This latter is a racemic mixture, with a typical ratio of 1 : 2 : 1 (3 S, 32 ̆ 7 S: 3 R, 32 ̆ 7 S: 3 R, 32 ̆ 7 R), while astaxanthin from natural sources has a variable distribution of the isomers deriving from the different biological organism that synthesized it. The high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis of all-trans isomers of astaxanthin was performed in different pigment sources, such as red yeast Phaffia rhodozyma, alga meal Haematococcus pluvialis, <b>krill</b> meal and <b>oil,</b> and shrimp meal. With the aim to investigate astaxanthin isomer ratios in flesh of fish fed different carotenoid sources, three groups of rainbow trout were fed for 60 days diets containing astaxanthin from synthetic source, H. pluvialis algae meal and P. rhodozyma red yeast. Moreover, the distribution of optical isomers of astaxanthin in trout purchased on the Italian market was investigated. A characteristic distribution of astaxanthin stereoisomers was detected for each pigment sources and such distribution was reproduced in the flesh of trout fed with that source. Colour values measured in different sites of fillet of rainbow trout fed with different pigment sources showed no significant differences. Similarly, different sources of pigment (natural or synthetic) produced colour values of fresh fillet with no relevant or significant differences. The coefficient of distance computed amongst the feed ingredient and the trout fillet astaxanthin stereoisomers was a useful tool to identify the origin of the pigment used on farm. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Biological chemistryKrill {{are small}} {{crustacean}} animals, living {{all over the}} world. They are key organisms in the marine food web. The petroleum industry releases oil to the sea with the produced water and by accidental oil spill, {{and there is a}} concern about the effect the <b>oil</b> has on <b>krill.</b> Discharges of <b>oil</b> can lead to a situation of oxidative stress in marine organisms. Biomarkers such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidative protein products (AOPP) can be used to detect oxidative stress. Existing methods for homogenization, total protein content, AOPP and MDA were modified and validated for use on krill homogenate. The methods were then utilized to analyze krill from a study performed at the International Research Institute of Stavanger (IRIS), where krill had been exposed to sublethal oil concentrations for eight days. The experiments were performed in spring, autumn and winter to investigate potential seasonal variations in biomarker response. The following results were obtained:  The homogenization process includes two successive centrifugation steps {{in order to get a}} clear and stable krill homogenate.  The krill homogenate had to be pre-diluted for the spectrophotometric methods to get an absorbance within the linear range of the calibrators (1 : 10 or 1 : 15 for total protein and 1 : 8. 3 or 1 : 13. 3 for AOPP).  Instrumental limits of detection and quantification for AOPP were 2. 44 μM and 7. 38 μM respectively, and the instrumental limit of quantification for MDA was 0. 28 μM.  The within-run variations were 7. 8 % and 4. 0 - 13 % for plasma control and krill homogenate respectively for AOPP, and 19 % for krill homogenate control for MDA.  Between-run variation was 8. 8 % for plasma control for AOPP, and 19 % and 10 % for krill homogenate control and plasma respectively for MDA.  AOPP and MDA levels were significantly higher in krill that were frozen directly after capture (T 0) in spring and autumn compared to krill kept in the laboratory (T 1).  Seasonal differences were detected with a significantly lower T 1 MDA level in the spring krill, a significantly higher T 0 MDA in autumn krill, and a significantly lower T 0 AOPP in winter compared to T 1 or T 0 respectively of the other seasons.  Any effect of the oil exposure however was not observed with MDA or AOPP. Three methods, AOPP, MDA and total protein, were successfully adjusted and validated for analysis of krill homogenate. Due to the good sensitivity of the methods, individual krill could be analyzed for both AOPP and MDA, and the concentrations normalized with respect total protein content. AOPP was a simple and fast method, and with higher precision than the MDA. An improved AOPP could be the method of choice for the future monitoring of oxidative stress level in krill. However, changes in AOPP or MDA levels due to oil treatment for eight days were not detectable due to a high natural variation of these biomarkers in the krill homogenate...|$|R

The overall objective of the thesis was to establish an exposure study that would be useful for estimation of the effects of oil in ice or blowout scenarios on northern marine keystone organisms. Further, some basic parameters of growth and moulting of the Northern krill from the Stavanger area was established under different experimental conditions. A moult pre-study tested three different feeding regimes (Artemia nauplii + commercial shrimo larvae feed (EZ larvae), Thalassiosira algae paste + EZ Larvae and starved) studied over a period of two months. The length measurements recorded for moults and frozen animals only differentiated between the starved group and the fed treatments, and overall negative INC values at the end in all treatments were most likely caused by maintenance procedures. The study showed that the fed groups kept their moulting rhythm while the starved group did not. The CFS exposure experiment conducted on M. norvegica revealed {{no significant difference between the}} Control (no oil), Low (0. 54 mg/l) or Medium (1. 6 mg/l) treatments of mechanically dispersed crude oil exposures in the moults frequency or animal lengths or weights. However, all individuals in the High (4. 9 mg/l) exposure group died before first sampling, and all in Medium died before the second sampling. Still, the Low treatment was persistently lower than the Control in all measured parameters and visual observation of the moults revealed potential bacterial infection on oil exposed individuals. The second exposure experiment assessed the toxicity of crude oil (0. 1 %) and oil treated with chemical dispersant Corexit 9500 A (2 % of oil concentration), resulting in a Control, Oil and O+D treatment. Behavioural observations, respiration rates and moulting were recorded for the Northern krill, and egg production and mortality recordings for C. finmarchicus monitored over a period of fourteen days. The behavioural observations illustrated a significant difference both between and within the three treatments over the course of the experiment. The majority of the <b>krill</b> in the <b>Oil</b> and O+D treatments appeared hyperactive at the start of exposure, though later the activity level in a large fraction of the krill in the exposed treatments decreased to what appeared to be narcosis. The behavioural observations were highly informative, and preceded the increase in mortality among the krill. Respiration rates at the early and late experimental days correlated to the krill behavioural observations at the corresponding dates, with high oxygen consumption in the exposed treatments at first, then lower consumption towards the end. A significant difference was found between the Control and the exposed groups at the end of the experiment, but not between the Oil and O+D treatments. Moult recordings revealed no significant difference between the treatments. Yet, the animals in the oil and oil + dispersant appeared to have a slightly postpone moulting compared to the Control. The egg production rates in C. finmarchicus did not reveal a significant difference between the treatments. However, a reduction egg production in the oil exposed treatments (even more so in O+D) compared to the Control was observed. The morality recordings of C. finmarchicus clearly differentiated in both experimental days, treatments and the combination of the two. There were close to five times higher mortality in the O+D treatment than in the Control, and approximately 2 times higher mortality in the Oil than seen in the Control at the fourteenth and final day of exposure. As a result, caution should be taken when considering the direct application of dispersant in natural environments, even though it has the advantage of rapidly removing crude oil. These results may provide knowledge and tools to prepare for environmental management of future operations in sensitive boreal and sub-arctic environments.

However, the arthritis score during the late phase of the study was only significantly reduced after <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> administration. Furthermore, mice fed the <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> diet demonstrated lower infiltration of inflammatory cells into the joint and synovial layer hyperplasia, when compared to control. Inclusion of fish oil and <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> in the diets led to a significant reduction in hyperplasia and total histology score. <b>Krill</b> <b>oil</b> did not modulate the levels of serum cytokines whereas consumption of fish oil increased the levels of IL- 1 α and IL- 13. Conclusions: The study suggests that <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> may be a useful intervention strategy against the clinical and histopathological signs of inflammatory arthritis...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{stress and}} neuroinflammation are {{implicated in the}} {{development}} and pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of <b>krill</b> <b>oil.</b> Oil from Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill), an Antarctic marine species, is rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We examined whether <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> diet (80 mg/kg/day for one month) prevents amyloidogenesis and cognitive impairment induced by intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (250 µg/kg, seven times daily) injections in AD mice model and found that <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> treatment inhibited the LPS-induced memory loss. We also found that <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> treatment inhibited the LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde levels. <b>Krill</b> <b>oil</b> also suppresses IκB degradation as well as p 50 and p 65 translocation into the nuclei of LPS-injected mice brain cells. In association with the inhibitory effect on neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> suppressed amyloid beta (1 – 42) peptide generation by the down-regulating APP and BACE 1 expression in vivo. We found that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (50 and 100 µM) dose-dependently decreased LPS-induced nitric oxide and ROS generation, and COX- 2 and iNOS expression as well as nuclear factor-κB activity in cultured microglial BV- 2 cells. These results suggest that <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> ameliorated impairment via anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anti-amyloidogenic mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{the western}} world, heart failure (HF) {{is one of}} the most {{important}} causes of cardiovascular mortality. Supplement with n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) has been shown to improve cardiac function in HF and to decrease mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). The molecular structure and composition of n- 3 PUFA varies between different marine sources and this may be of importance for their biological effects. <b>Krill</b> <b>oil,</b> unlike fish oil supplements, contains the major part of the n- 3 PUFA in the form of phospholipids. This study investigated effects of <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> on cardiac remodeling after experimental MI. Rats were randomised to pre-treatment with <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> or control feed 14 days before induction of MI. Seven days post-MI, the rats were examined with echocardiography and rats in the control group were further randomised to continued control feed or <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> feed for 7 weeks before re-examination with echocardiography and euthanization. Results The echocardiographic evaluation showed significant attenuation of LV dilatation in the group pretreated with <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> compared to controls. Attenuated heart weight, lung weight, and levels of mRNA encoding classical markers of LV stress, matrix remodeling and inflammation reflected these findings. The total composition of fatty acids were examined in the left ventricular (LV) tissue and all rats treated with <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> showed a significantly higher proportion of n- 3 PUFA in the LV tissue, although no difference was seen between the two <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> groups. Conclusions Supplement with <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> leads to a proportional increase of n- 3 PUFA in myocardial tissue and supplement given before induction of MI attenuates LV remodeling. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the study}} was to explore the effects of 12 weeks daily <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> supplementation on fasting serum {{triglyceride}} (TG) and lipoprotein particle levels in subjects whose habitual fish intake is low and who have borderline high or high fasting serum TG levels (150 – 499 mg/dL). We hypothesized that <b>Krill</b> <b>oil</b> lowers serum TG levels in subjects with borderline high or high fasting TG levels. To test our hypothesis 300 male and female subjects were included in a double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study with five treatment groups: placebo (olive oil) or 0. 5, 1, 2, or 4 g/day of <b>krill</b> <b>oil.</b> Serum lipids were measured after an overnight fast at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Due to a high intra-individual variability in TG levels, data from all subjects in the four <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> groups were pooled to increase statistical power, and a general time- and dose-independent one-way analysis of variance was performed to assess efficacy. Relative to subjects in the placebo group, those administered <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> had a statistically significant calculated reduction in serum TG levels of 10. 2 %. Moreover, LDL-C levels were not increased in the <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> groups relative to the placebo group. The outcome of the pooled analysis suggests that <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> is effective in reducing a cardiovascular risk factor. However, owing to the individual fluctuations of TG concentrations measured, a study with more individual measurements per treatment group is needed to increase the confidence of these findings...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{suggest that the}} gut microbiota plays vital roles in metabolic diseases such as hyperlipidemia. Previous studies have confirmed that <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> can alleviate hyperlipidemia, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To discern whether <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> changes {{the structure of the}} gut microbiota during the hyperlipidemia treatment, 72 mice were acclimatized with a standard chow diet for 2 weeks and then randomly allocated to receive a standard chow diet (control group, n = 12) or a high-sugar-high-fat (HSHF) diet supplemented with a low (100 μg/g·d, HSHF+LD group, n = 12), moderate (200 μg/g·d, HSHF+MD group, n = 12) or high dosage of <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> (600 μg/g·d, HSHF+HD group, n = 12), simvastatin (HSHF+S group, n = 12) or saline (HSHF group, n = 12) continuously for 12 weeks. The resulting weight gains were attenuated, the liver index and the low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations showed a stepwise reduction in the treated groups compared with those of the control group. A dose-dependent modulation of the gut microbiota was observed after treatment with <b>krill</b> <b>oil.</b> Low- and moderate- doses of <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> increased the similarity between the composition of the HSHF diet-induced gut microbiota and that of the control, whereas the mice fed the high-dose exhibited a unique gut microbiota structure that was {{different from that of the}} control and HSHF groups. Sixty-five key operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that responded to the <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> treatment were identified using redundancy analysis, of which 26 OTUs were increased and 39 OTUs were decreased compared with those of the HSHF group. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study suggest that the structural alterations in the gut microbiota induced by <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> treatment were dose-dependent and associated with the alleviation of hyperlipidemia. Additionally, the high-dose <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> treatment showed combined effects on the alleviation of hyperlipidemia and obesity...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effects of <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> on blood lipids, {{specifically}} total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). METHODS: A multi-center, three-month, prospective, randomized study followed by a three-month, controlled follow-up of patients treated with 1 g and 1. 5 g <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> daily. Patients with hyperlipidemia able to maintain a healthy diet and with blood cholesterol levels between 194 and 348 mg/dL were eligible for enrollment in the trial. A sample size of 120 patients (30 patients/group) was {{randomly assigned to one}} of four groups. Group A received <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> at a body mass index (BMI) -dependent daily dosage of 2 - 3 g daily. Patients in Group B were given 1 - 1. 5 g <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> daily, and Group C was given fish oil containing 180 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 120 mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per gram of oil at a dose of 3 g daily.

40|$|AbstractThe {{safety of}} <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> was {{assessed}} in a subchronic toxicity study {{and in a}} genotoxicity test. In a 13 -week study, rats were fed <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> or control diets. There were no differences noted in body weight, food consumption or in the functional observation battery parameters in either gender. Differences in both haematology and clinical chemistry values were noted in the krill oil-treated groups. However these findings were of no toxicological significance. Significant decreases in absolute and covariant heart weight in some krill oil-treated animals were noted although no corresponding histological changes were observed. In addition, periportal microvesicular hepatocyte vacuolation was noted histologically in males fed 5 % <b>krill</b> <b>oil.</b> This finding {{was not associated with}} other indications of hepatic dysfunction. Given that the effects of the 13 -week toxicity study were non-toxic in nature, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for the conditions of this study was considered to be 5 % <b>krill</b> <b>oil.</b> The genotoxicity experiments documented no mutagenicity of <b>krill</b> <b>oil</b> in bacteria...|$|E
