5|$|Claudius was a heretic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Dungal and Jonas of Orléans, {{who later}} wrote to refute {{some of his}} teachings {{at the request of}} the emperor. The last {{recorded}} act of Claudius is in a charter of the monastery of St Peter at Novalesa in May 827. He was dead by the time Dungal finished his Responsa contra peruersas Claudii Taurinensis episcopi sententias late in 827, so it can be presumed that he died that year.|$|E
5|$|His {{antiquarian}} studies led Planché to take {{an interest}} in heraldry. He had published several papers on heraldic topics in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association before publishing in 1852 The Pursuivant of Arms, or, Heraldry founded upon facts. As indicated by the subtitle, Planché was concerned with verifiable facts, as opposed to the unfounded theories perpetuated by many earlier heraldic writers. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> eminent herald Sir Anthony Wagner, Planché rewrote the early history of heraldry.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Mary Beagon, {{writing in}} The Classical Tradition in 2010:the Historia naturalis has regained its status {{to a greater}} extent than at any time since the advent of Humanism. Work by those with {{scientific}} as well as philological expertise has resulted in improvements both to Pliny's text and to his reputation as a scientist. The essential coherence of his enterprise has also been rediscovered, and his ambitious portrayal, in all its manifestations, of 'nature, that is, life'.. is recognized as a unique cultural record of its time.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Pierre Riché, the {{disappearance}} of 220 bishops' seats indicates that the Lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the Church. Yet according to Walter Pohl the regions directly occupied by Alboin suffered less devastation and had a relatively robust survival rate for towns, whereas the occupation of territory by autonomous military bands interested mainly in raiding and looting had a more severe impact, with the bishoprics in such places rarely surviving.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main {{influences}} were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz {{also important}} to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.|$|E
50|$|Many {{countries}} and national censuses currently enumerate or have previously enumerated their populations by race, ethnicity, nationality, {{or a combination}} of these characteristics. Different countries have different classifications and census options for race and ethnicity/nationality which are not comparable with data from other countries. In addition, many of the race and ethnicity concepts that appear on national censuses worldwide have their origins in Europe or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> Europeans, rather than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locals of these countries.|$|R
40|$|In {{its regular}} February survey Public Opinion Research Centre further {{examined}} whether {{people think that}} politicians are interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> citizens, and whether <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opinion of the Czech public, people have certain opportunities to influence the public sphere. Regarding the interest <b>of</b> politicians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> citizens, <b>the</b> vast majority (82 %) of the Czech public thinks that only minority of Czech politicians is interested in people's opinion. 14 % of the population believe that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> citizens is interested none of Czech elected politicians. Within the possibilities to influence the public sphere has occurred shift in a positive direction in all researched spheres, which is <b>the</b> most evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of ​​solving problems in respondents’ village or town. Also assessing the potential to influence public sphere is in all analyzed aspects related to the assessment of living standards of respondent's household, while people with good living standards {{are more likely to}} feel they can influence public sphere...|$|R

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the {{production}} team, Peggy's breast cancer was a catalyst, creating new dynamics and tensions amongst existing characters. Realism {{was also an}} issue. As a middle-aged woman, Peggy was epidemiologically at higher risk for developing breast cancer. In 2001, {{it was reported that}} Peggy's character was one of only a few media portrayals of older females to be given the disease, and source organisations have praised EastEnders for this.|$|E
5|$|Metal {{artefacts}} {{share the}} same geometric designs {{that are used in}} other forms of Islamic art. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Hamilton Gibb, the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area they are most often used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. Geometric designs in Islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs, or they can form the background pattern.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare's first plays {{were written}} in the {{conventional}} style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from {{the needs of the}} characters or the drama. The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. The grand speeches in Titus Andronicus, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in The Two Gentlemen of Verona has been described as stilted.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{companies}} that he recorded for at this stage in his career reduced Hope's dignity, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> musician and critic Robert Palmer. One album was entitled High Hope! (1961), and another, released as Sounds from Rikers Island (1963) in reference to a New York City jail complex, featured performances exclusively by musicians who had at some point been imprisoned for drug-related crimes. Between these two sessions as leader, Hope was briefly in prison again for drug offenses. These and other album releases in the early 1960s did little to develop a wider awareness of Hope.|$|E
5|$|The amputated parts {{might be}} placed in a pouch for the girl to wear. A single hole of 2–3mm is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid. The vulva is closed with {{surgical}} thread, or agave or acacia thorns, and might be covered with a poultice of raw egg, herbs and sugar. To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after two to six weeks. If the remaining hole is too large <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the girl's family, the procedure is repeated.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{king of the}} third kingdom is Ibbit-Lim, who {{described}} himself as the Mekim of Ebla. A basalt votive statue bearing Ibbit-Lim's inscription was discovered in 1968; this helped to identify the site of Tell-Mardikh with the ancient kingdom Ebla. The name of the king is Amorite <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Pettinato; it is therefore probable the inhabitants of third kingdom Ebla were predominantly Amorites, as were most of the inhabitants of Syria at that time.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} (First Nations, Inuit and Métis) {{distinctive}} groups of North America indigenous peoples {{recognized in the}} Canadian Constitution Act, 1982, sections 25 and 35.

5|$|These repressive {{measures}} included taking prominent Serbs hostage against Serb attacks. To {{avoid being}} {{taken as a}} hostage, Stojanović paid 100,000 dinars to the Ustaše in Prijedor. Resistance began to emerge in occupied Yugoslavia; royalists and Serbian nationalists {{under the leadership of}} then-Colonel Draža Mihailović founded the Ravna Gora Movement, whose members were called Chetniks. The KPJ, led by Josip Broz Tito, prepared to rise to arms at a favourable moment. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the KPJ, the fight against the Axis and its domestic collaborators would be a common fight of all Yugoslav peoples.|$|E
5|$|Æthelnoth was {{a son of}} the Æthelmær the Stout and a {{grandson}} of Æthelweard the Historian, who was a great-great-grandson of Æthelred I. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the historian Frank Barlow, Æthelnoth was probably the uncle of Godwin of Wessex. He was baptised by Dunstan, and a story was told at Glastonbury Abbey that as the infant was baptised, his hand made a motion much like that an archbishop makes when blessing. From this motion, Dunstan {{is said to have}} prophesied that Æthelnoth would become an archbishop.|$|E

40|$|In {{this short}} essay, I express my {{personal}} remarks on how <b>the</b> methodology <b>in</b> linguistic research should be. There were three big waves {{in this field}} since the nineteenth century when {{the direction of the}} research was established. Paradigm shifts have occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> 2 ̆ 2 What the language is. 2 ̆ 2 Accordingly, the research methods for language have changed drastically. First, <b>the</b> historical changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> language are surveyed. Next, I consider the characteristics and the collecting methods of the data, which have supported the research. Finally, I argue what kind of methodology we should adopt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experimental research of sentence comprehension in which I am engaged...|$|R

5|$|Alfred also {{assisted}} {{his own son}} {{by promoting}} men who could be relied on to support him, and by giving him opportunities for command in battle once he was old enough. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Barbara Yorke, the compilation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which magnified Alfred's achievements, may have been partly intended to strengthen {{the case for the}} succession of his own descendants. However, Yorke also argues that Æthelwold's position was not fatally undermined by Alfred's will. His mother had witnessed a charter as regina, whereas Alfred followed West Saxon tradition in refusing to have his wife consecrated as queen, and Æthelwold's status as the son of a queen may have given him an advantage over Edward. Æthelwold was still the senior ætheling, and the only surviving charter he witnessed shows both him and Edward as filius regis (son of a king), but lists Æthelwold above Edward, implying that he ranked above him.|$|E
5|$|Hagiographic {{accounts}} of Harding's life quickly followed his death, such as Joe Mitchell Chapple's Life and Times of Warren G. Harding, Our After-War President (1924). By then, the scandals were breaking, and the Harding administration {{soon became a}} byword for corruption <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the public. Works written in the late 1920s helped shape Harding's historical reputation: Masks in a Pageant by William Allen White mocked and dismissed Harding, as did Samuel Hopkins Adams' fictionalized account of the Harding administration, Revelry. These books depicted Harding's time in office as one of great presidential weakness. The publication of Nan Britton's bestselling book disclosing they had had an affair also lowered the late president in public esteem. President Coolidge, not wishing to be further associated with his predecessor, refused to dedicate the Harding Tomb. Hoover, Coolidge's successor, was similarly reluctant, but with Coolidge in attendance presided over the dedication in 1931. By that time, with the Great Depression in full swing, Hoover was nearly as discredited as Harding.|$|E
5|$|Scotland Yard issued another {{appeal in}} March 2014 for {{information}} {{about a man who}} had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.|$|E
