2500|$|In the Jets' postgame press conference, Sanchez explained: [...] "I was {{thinking}} a different play in my head. That was a mental error there. As soon as I {{realized there was}} no one to hand it to I started to run toward the line and tried to cover it up and just get down and <b>I</b> <b>slid</b> right into Brandon Moore." [...] "I was just trying to get down. The play was over. Say 'Uncle'. Do the right thing. Get to second-and-10 and live to play another down. I'm not a big believer in luck, but that was pretty unlucky. It was really too bad." [...] In an interview six days later, Sanchez described the play again: [...] "It's embarrassing. You screw up the play and I'm trying to do the right thing. It's not like I'm trying to force something. I start to slide and I slide in the worst spot I possibly could—right into Brandon Moore. I guess (I was) more stunned than anything. Just like a car accident. I was like, 'Whoa. What just happened?' Then, the ball's gone. It was weird." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>slid</b> on the West Shore line, <b>I</b> <b>slid</b> till midnight, {{and they}} dumped me {{down at the}} door of a frowzy hotel in Elmira. Yes, they knew all about [...] "that man Clemens," [...] but {{reckoned}} he was not in town; had gone East somewhere. I had better possess my soul in patience till the morrow, and then dig up the [...] "man Clemens'" [...] brother-in-law, who was interested in coal.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>slid</b> {{down from}} the window-seat, and stood facing them, not knowing what else to do. They, too, seemed equally confounded.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, I {{only mean}} {{that if it}} was me, I wouldn't keep papers as might hang me, {{littering}} about when they might be turned into money--them as wasn't useful made away with, and them as was, laid by somewheres, safe; that's all,' returned Squeers; 'but everybody's the best judge of their own affairs. All <b>I</b> say is, <b>Slider,</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't do it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want a rope {{fifty feet}} long; {{not a very}} thick one, but strong enough to bear my weight. That is the first thing. Then I want a disguise; but that I could get, if a friend would be in {{readiness}} {{to give it to}} me, after <b>I</b> had <b>slid</b> down the rope into the street." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{had only}} <b>slid</b> the chair {{a little further}} back, {{reaching}} behind me to tap on the leather of the screen, but he jumped like a rat.|$|R
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>slid</b> {{for a dozen}} {{miles or}} more, sleepily, down the Ticino valley, sitting {{opposite}} two fat priests in their feminine black.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>slid</b> {{out on the}} {{opposite}} side over the water on a spar lashed across the canoe, and we were full and away on the other tack.|$|E
60|$|At least, he {{was talking}} and grinning, {{and the old man}} was making a noise like distant thunder, which I {{supposed}} was his way of chuckling. <b>I</b> <b>slid</b> out and left them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, the children!" [...] <b>I</b> said, and <b>slid</b> my low {{chair back}} till it nearly touched the screen that hid them. [...] "I wonder whether they'll {{come out for}} me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It is {{generally}} believed that scientific talent reveals itself in early youth. ... This {{was certainly not}} my case. <b>I</b> somehow <b>slid</b> into my scientific profession. My mother wished for me to become a physician, just like my father. ...I myself {{wanted to be a}} lawyer, defender of the unjustly accused. But my career is the result of political circumstances, academic possibilities, and lucky accidents." [...] Talking about his life in a 2001 speech.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gad, sir, {{no bones}} broken, {{but a good}} deal of 'possum {{scratching}} about the head for such a little throw like that. <b>I</b> must have <b>slid</b> a yard or two on my left ear before I brought up." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>slid</b> out, {{happy with}} the sense of a close shave and a mighty deliverance; and I heard him {{laughing}} to himself and slapping his fat thighs after I had closed his door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Get back, Hans, {{before the}} {{lightning}} shows you," [...] I said, as <b>I</b> <b>slid</b> gently from a mangrove-root into that filthy stream, [...] "and {{tell them to}} keep my coat and trousers dry if they can." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{looked out}} {{and saw a}} number of people walking up and down the street. No one {{appeared}} to be watching me, and waiting a favorable opportunity, <b>I</b> <b>slid</b> out of the window to the sidewalk below.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{must have}} <b>slid</b> {{downward}} {{thousands of feet}} before the steep incline curved gently on to a broad, smooth, snow-covered plateau. Across this I hurtled with slowly diminishing velocity, until at last objects about me began to take definite shape.|$|R
60|$|She {{talked to}} me of the various things which they talk of to the {{stranger}} in Samoa, of the journey, and whether <b>I</b> had <b>slid</b> down the water rock at Papaseea, and if I meant {{to stay in a}} native village. She {{talked to me}} of Scotland, and perhaps I noticed in her a tendency to enlarge on the sumptuousness of her establishment there. She asked me naïvely if I knew Mrs This and Mrs That, with whom she had been acquainted when she lived in the north.|$|R
5000|$|Andrea Carrea was a {{domestique}} for Fausto Coppi. [...] "He was a gregario par excellence", {{said the}} journalist Jean-Luc Gatellier, [...] "the incarnation of personal disinterest... showing to perfection {{the notion of}} personal sacrifice. He refused the slightest bit of personal glory." [...] Carrea was riding the Tour de France of 1952 and joined an attack to Lausanne to protect his leader's interests.Carrea said: [...] "Without knowing it, <b>I</b> had <b>slid</b> into the important break {{of the day and}} at Lausanne, to my great surprise, I heard I had inherited a jersey destined for champions. For me, it was a terrible situation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, papa. I hit Sam {{right in}} the head with a big snow-ball, and I made Betty run into the house, and <b>I</b> <b>slid</b> down to all by myself. Sam was afraid," [...] said Noah to his father.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a chance, R. C.," [...] I replied. [...] "Had {{that all}} figured. I never put any strain on your line until the wave went back. Then <b>I</b> <b>slid</b> him out, the leader broke, and I scooped him up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ken, dear Ken, {{dear old}} Peggie," [...] cried Trace, [...] "you know I've got a skinned place on my hip where <b>I</b> <b>slid</b> yesterday. Steam isn't good for that, Worry says. He'll be sore. You must let me out." ...|$|E
60|$|I beard a {{crunching}} of gravel. Even as I wheeled I felt {{a tremendous}} {{pull on the}} lasso and I seemed to be sailing in the air. I got a blurred glimpse of Herky-Jerky leaning back on the taut lasso. Then <b>I</b> plunged down, <b>slid</b> over the rocks, and went souse into the spring.|$|R
60|$|As I mention my cold's {{being so}} bad, I will add that I {{have never had}} {{anything}} the matter with me since I came here but the cold. It is now in my throat, and slightly on my chest. It occasions me great discomfort, and you would suppose, seeing me in the morning, that I could not possibly read at night. But I have always {{come up to the}} scratch, have not yet missed one night, and have gradually got used to that. I had got much the better of it; but the dressing-room at the hall here is singularly cold and draughty, and so <b>I</b> have <b>slid</b> back again.|$|R
6000|$|You! With your warm, full, rich, red, ripe lips, And your beautifully manicured finger-tips! [...] You! With your heaving, panting, rapidly {{expanding}} and [...] contracting chest, Lying against my perfectly ordinary shirt-front and [...] dinner-jacket vest. [...] It {{is too much}} [...] Your touch [...] As such. [...] It and [...] Your hand, [...] Can you not understand? Last night an ostrich feather from your fragrant hair [...] Unnoticed fell. [...] I guard it [...] Well. [...] Yestere'en [...] From your tiara <b>I</b> have <b>slid,</b> [...] Unseen, [...] A single diamond, [...] And I keep it [...] Hid. Last night you left inside the vestibule upon the sill [...] A quarter dollar, [...] And I have it [...] Still.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, just business, don't you know. The {{same sort}} of thing Carnegie and Rockefeller and all these coves do, you know." [...] <b>I</b> <b>slid</b> for the door. [...] "Awfully sorry to leave you, but I've got to {{meet some of the}} lads elsewhere." ...|$|E
60|$|Instantly {{the door}} was pressed open at the top to the width of several inches. Into this opening <b>I</b> <b>slid</b> {{the end of the}} board, and by thus working it down, managed in a few moments to snap the lock, and then the door flew open.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can do it}} by goin' to Antelope Spring an' findin' a doctor," [...] Dick replied. [...] "You see, daddy {{shot himself}} in the leg--stove a bone all to pieces; and mother don't know what to do, so <b>I</b> <b>slid</b> off this mornin' without tellin' anybody." ...|$|E
60|$|And even as <b>I</b> looked he <b>slid</b> {{down from}} out of her arms; back into the pool, and began {{struggling}} to gain the edge. What grief and longing in her wild face then! But she did not wail. She {{did not try to}} pull him back; that elfish heart of dignity could reach out to what was coming, it could not drag at what was gone. Unmoving as the boughs and water, she watched him abandon her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{tried to}} clamber past {{the wall that}} barred the way there by sheer force of stride--you know, my legs are long--and I somehow overbalanced myself. But I didn't exactly fall--if I had fallen, I must have been killed; <b>I</b> rolled and <b>slid</b> down, {{clutching}} at the weeds in the crannies as I slipped, and stumbling over the projections, without quite losing my foothold on the ledges, till I found myself brought up short with a bump {{at the end of}} it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If it had bin a sixty-foot bridge, an' <b>I</b> could ha' <b>slid</b> {{off into}} deep water an' blown up an' killed both men, same as others have done, I wouldn't ha' cared; {{but to be}} ditched by a shote--an' {{you to help me}} out--in a corn-field--an' an old hayseed in his nightgown cussin' me like as if I was a sick truck-horse!... Oh, it's awful! Don't call me Mogul! I'm a sewin'-machine, they'll guy my sand-box off in the yard." ...|$|R
60|$|Mary hid {{her face}} in Patt's bosom, but it was soon drawn out by my dear {{grandmother}} to kiss it; then my uncle had his turn, and Patt hers. After this, the whole party, except Mary and <b>I,</b> <b>slid</b> out of the room, and--yes, {{and then it was}} my turn.|$|E
6000|$|Jim moved {{a little}} way along the locker, {{and you could see}} he was insulted. He kept shaking his head and muttering, and so <b>I</b> <b>slid</b> along to him and patted him on the leg, and petted him up, and got him over the worst of his feelings, and then he says: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>slid</b> {{down the}} rubbish, {{struggled}} to my feet, clapped my hands over my ears, and bolted into the scullery. The curate, {{who had been}} crouching silently with {{his arms over his}} head, looked up as I passed, cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after me.|$|E
500|$|A {{second group}} {{surrounded}} PC Coombes, who sustained a five-inch-long cut to his face, and broken {{upper and lower}} jaws. In 2004 {{he said he was}} still suffering the effects of the attack, which the police regard as attempted murder, including poor hearing and eyesight, epileptic fits, and a memory so poor that he was left unable to read a book or drive. A third constable, Michael Shepherd, had his protective helmet pierced by an iron spike. Several of the officers and firemen turned and ran back toward the crowd to try to save Blakelock and Coombes. Trevor Stratford told a reporter in 2010: [...] "I remember running in with another fire officer to get Dick Coombes. <b>I</b> literally <b>slid</b> into the group, like a rugby player charging into a ruck. We dragged him out, but he was in a hell of a state": ...|$|R
6000|$|Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing girls!--the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I still rest me on thy mat, but {{the soft}} soil has <b>slid!</b> <b>I</b> saw thee woven in the wood, my mat! green {{the first day}} I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted quite. Ah me!--not thou nor I can bear the change! How then, if so be transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee's peak of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the villages?--The blast, the blast! Up, spine, and meet it! (Leaps to his feet.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{talk about}} it, Tom. I've tried it, and it don't work; it don't work, Tom. It ain't for me; I ain't used to it. The widder's good to me, and friendly; but I can't stand them ways. She makes me get up {{just at the}} same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all to thunder; she won't let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don't seem to any air git through 'em, somehow; and they're so rotten nice that I can't set down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher's; <b>I</b> hain't <b>slid</b> on a cellar-door for--well, it 'pears to be years; I got to go to church and sweat and sweat--I hate them ornery sermons! I can't ketch a fly in there, I can't chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell--everything's so awful reg'lar a body can't stand it." ...|$|R
