40|$|The {{formation}} of an <b>epithelial</b> <b>organ</b> requires a set of organ-specific gene programs that instruct parallel and successive developmental events. Still, {{it is unclear what}} are the core regulatory programs and how such programs are timely coordinated within the organ. We use mainly the Drosophila trachea (respiratory system) as a model to understand <b>epithelial</b> <b>organ</b> development. The trachea is a network of epithelial tubes, and its morphology is sensitive to mutations in genes whose products participate in consecutive steps of branching morphogenesis and tube size maturation. In paper I, we identified two gene functions required for tracheal tube elongation. We show that tracheal cells, at a specific time in development, acquire an ability to elongate that is mediated by a protein involved in actin organization. A luminal matrix holds back this elongation, and temporal expression of an anion channel appears required to modify the luminal matrix and thereby permit a controlled extent of elongation. In paper II, we show that a mucin-like protein is temporally expressed in the trachea and is required for tube elongation. The protein also drives diameter expansion of the hindgut, where it fills the growing lumen and appears to physically dilate the tube. The work demonstrates that regulated expression of a single protein can model epithelial tube diameter. In papers III and IV, we focused on the temporal regulation of tracheal gene expression, and uncovered an important function for the mid-embryonic ecdysone hormone pulse in progression of organ development. In paper III, we analysed the mechanism of embryonic ecdysone signalling and found that the hormone causes pan-embryonic activation of Ecdysone Receptor (EcR). EcR acts tissue-autonomously together with Ultraspiracle to promote concurrent progression of organ development. In paper IV, we show that ecdysone, via EcR and a downstream cascade of gene regulators is needed to advance parallel tracheal-specific gene programs. Together, the results reveal novel gene functions during epithelial tube formation, and show that correct temporal unfolding of the tracheal gene network relies on gene-regulatory input from an external cue in form of a hormone pulse...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe mouse {{mammary gland}} {{is the only}} <b>epithelial</b> <b>organ</b> capable of {{complete}} regeneration upon orthotopic transplantation, making it ideally suited for in vivo gene function studies through viral-mediated gene delivery. A hurdle that has challenged the widespread adoption of this technique has been the inability to transduce mammary stem cells effectively. We have overcome this limitation by infecting total primary mammary epithelial cells in suspension with high-titer lentiviruses. Transduced cells gave rise to all major cell types of the mammary gland and were capable of clonal outgrowth and functional differentiation in serial transplants. To demonstrate that this method is a valuable alternative to developing transgenic animals, we used lentiviral-mediated Wnt- 1 overexpression to replicate MMTV-Wnt- 1 mammary phenotypes and used a dominant-negative Xenopus Suppressor of Hairless to revealÂ a requirement for Notch signaling during ductal morphogenesis.

Anx 2 binds Cdc 42, recruiting it to the apical surface. Cdc 42 recruits aPKC to the apical surface. Loss of function of PTEN, Anx 2, Cdc 42, or aPKC prevents normal development of the apical surface and lumen.

Organ rudiments were isolated from gestational day 13 mouse embryos and cultured for 24, 48, or 72 hours. Whole mounts were stained by indirect immunofluorescence and then examined using a Zeiss Laser Scan Microscope. We found that each ECM component examined had a distinct distribution and that the distribution of some molecules varied with culture time. Laminin was mainly restricted to the basement membrane. BM- 1 proteoglycan was concentrated in the basement membrane and also formed a fine network throughout the mesenchyme. Type IV collagen was mainly located in the basement membrane of the epithelium, but it was also present throughout the mesenchyme. Type V collagen was distributed throughout the mesenchyme at 24 hours, but at 48 hours was principally located in the basement membrane. Type I collagen was distributed throughout the mesenchyme at all culture times, and accumulated in the clefts and particularly at the epithelial-mesenchymal interface as time in culture increased.

Sex hormones also {{play a major role in}} regulating the growth and phenotypes of these <b>epithelial</b> <b>organs</b> (sexual dimorphism). How the sex hormones are coupled to the morphogens is mostly unknown. In this thesis I utilized two distinct epithelial appendage models, a chicken tail feather (between rooster and hen), and the mouse mammary gland model.

We also utilized the transgenic KRT 14 -Noggin (BMP antagonist) mouse that shows abnormal mammary gland stroma formation and delayed involution. Imbalance of BMP pathway lead to increased collagen I deposition surrounding the ducts and hair formation within the nipple of these transgenic mice.

Nutrient restriction leads to catabolic responses {{in the majority of}} tissues, but the Drosophila mitotic imaginal discs continue growing. The nature of these differential control mechanisms that spare distinct tissues from starvation are poorly understood. Here, we reveal that the Ret-like receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), Stitcher (Stit), is required for cell growth and proliferation through the PI 3 K-I/TORC 1 pathway in the Drosophila wing disc. Both Stit and insulin receptor (InR) signaling activate PI 3 K-I and drive cellular proliferation and tissue growth. However, whereas optimal growth requires signaling from both InR and Stit, catabolic changes manifested by autophagy only occur when both signaling pathways are compromised. The combined activities of Stit and InR in ectodermal epithelial tissues provide an RTK-mediated, two-tiered reaction threshold to varying nutritional conditions that promote <b>epithelial</b> <b>organ</b> growth even at low levels of InR signaling...|$|E

40|$|<b>Epithelial</b> <b>organs</b> {{are made}} of tubes and {{cavities}} lined by a monolayer of polarized cells that enclose the central lumen. Lumen formation is a crucial step {{in the formation of}} <b>epithelial</b> <b>organs.</b> The Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Cdc 42, which is a master regulator of cell polarity, regulates the formation of the central lumen in epithelial morphogenesis. However, how Cdc 42 is regulated during this process is still poorly understood. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) control the activation of small GTPases. Using the three-dimensional Madinâ€“Darby canine kidney model, we have identified a Cdc 42 -specific GEF, Intersectin 2 (ITSN 2), which localizes to the centrosomes and regulates Cdc 42 activation during epithelial morphogenesis. Silencing of either Cdc 42 or ITSN 2 disrupts the correct orientation of the mitotic spindle and normal lumen formation, suggesting a direct relationship between these processes. Furthermore, we demonstrated this direct relationship using LGN, a component of the machinery for mitotic spindle positioning, whose disruption also results in lumen formation defects.

40|$|Mucins {{are large}} and highly glycosylated {{proteins}} and major component of the mucus that coats the lining of epithelial organs. Mucins are characterized {{by the presence of}} extended regions rich in the amino acids Proline, Threonine and Serine (PTS domain), where the Serines and Threonines are O-glycosylated to form sugar-rich mucin domains. Mucins are classified into secreted gel-forming mucins and transmembrane mucins with possible signaling functions. The amino acid sequence of the PTS domains tends to be poorly conserved between species and different mucins. The goal of this thesis was to identify and study potential mucin-like proteins in Drosophila melanogaster. We devised a simple bioinformatic approach and developed a program that can identify PTS domains based on amino acid content. We thereby identified 36 mucins and mucin-related proteins. All proteins appear to be secreted, except for two that harbor a predicted transmembrane domain. Expression analysis at different stages of the Drosophila life cycle revealed that many mucins are expressed in the larval gut, consistent with a function in mucosal barrier formation. Interestingly, some of the mucins showed dynamic expression in different tubular organs during embryogenesis. Among these was Mur 96 B/Tenectin (Tnc) that was further studied to dissect its role in <b>epithelial</b> <b>organ</b> development. We found that Tnc is critical for diameter expansion of the developing hindgut. Tnc forms a transient matrix that fills the hindgut lumen and drives expansion in a dose-dependent manner, presumably by generating a luminal pressure. This study revealed a new mechanism in organ development, whereby the extent of lumen volume expansion can be regulated by the accumulation of single glycoprotein. In parallel to the bioinformatic approach, we identified a Drosophila protein that shares conserved domains with human SUSD 2 and the non-mucin parts of human MUC 4, called Mesh. We aimed to analyze Mesh function as a means to address the roles of these domains. Mesh was found to be is expressed in the digestive tract epithelium from mid-embryogenesis and throughout larval and adult life, localizing to the apical junction belt. Mesh is required for correct organization of the Scribble-complex, a main polarity complex conserved between fly and mammals, to prevent excess expansion of apical cell surface and for microvilli organization.

Depletion of Chimaerin causes over-activation of Rac 1 at the apical membrane in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), followed by luminal cell accumulation. Importantly, Chimaerin depletion did not inhibit extension formation at the basal membrane.

Alteration of the mechanical properties of the ECM {{has been shown to}} promote cell migration and invasion in cancer cells, but the effects on epithelial morphogenesis have not been characterized. We analyzed the effects of cell confinement on lumen morphogenesis using a novel, micropatterned, three-dimensional (3 D) Madin-Darby canine kidney cell culture method. We show that cell confinement, by controlling cell spreading, limits peripheral actin contractility and promotes centrosome positioning and lumen initiation after the first cell division. In addition, peripheral actin contractility is mediated by master kinase Par- 4 /LKB 1 via the RhoA-Rho kinase-myosin II pathway, and inhibition of this pathway restores lumen initiation in minimally confined cells.

Apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and an increase in IEL numbers are classical signs of intestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), although whether IEL can mediate IEC apoptosis directly in GVHD is unclear. Recent evidence suggests that target <b>epithelial</b> <b>organ</b> injury observed in GVHD is predominantly Fas-mediated; therefore, we investigated the possibility that IEL induce apoptosis of IEC through a Fas-mediated mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that the IEL isolated from normal mice readily display potent Fas ligand (FasL) -mediated killing activity after CD 3 stimulation, and that IEC express Fas, suggesting that IEC are potential targets for FasL-mediated killing by IEL. In vitro, IEL isolated from GVHD mice have markedly increased FasL-mediated killing potential and are spontaneously cytolytic toward host-derived tumor cells predominantly through a Fas-mediated pathway. In vivo transfer of IEL isolated from GVHD mice induced significantly more IEC apoptosis in F 1 wild-type mice than in Fas-defective F 1 lpr mice.

During pancreas development, mesenchyme-derived structures induce specification, growth and differentiation of pancreatic epithelial cells. For instance, notochord, endothelial cells, and pancreatic mesenchyme {{are essential for}} the development of the pancreas. N-cadherin deficient-embryos suffer from dorsal pancreas agenesis due to apoptosis of the mesenchyme surrounding the pancreatic epithelium. N-cadherin-deficient embryos expressing N-cadherin or E-cadherin ectopically in the heart rescue dorsal pancreas formation, indicating that the phenotype is secondary to cardio-vascular defects. These results suggest that circulating factors are important for dorsal pancreas development. Here we identify a sphingolipid, sphingosine- 1 -phosphate, to be important for dorsal pancreas formation. S 1 P acts on receptors (S 1 P 1, S 1 P 2, and S 1 P 3) expressed in the pancreatic mesenchyme, inducing mesenchymal growth. Studies on the S 1 P 1 receptor knockout showed a reduced size of the dorsal pancreatic bud due to decreased proliferation of Pdx 1 + cells. Other <b>epithelial</b> <b>organs</b> revealed growth defects. The lung epithelium had fewer branches and the stomach was smaller. This suggests that endothelial cells are essential for early development of the pancreatic epithelium. Since N-cadherin deficient embryos die at embryonic day E 10, due to the cardio-vascular phenotype, we used a conditional N-cadherin deficient-mouse which was intercrossed with a Pdx- 1 -Cre driven transgenic line to generate a pancreas specific knockout. Our results indicate that N-cadherin neither is important for pancreas morphogenesis nor endocrine specification. This could be due to variable recombination efficiency of the Pdx- 1 -Cre line during development. However, mutant Î²-cells have fewer mature insulin secreting granules in the N-cadherin deleted islets indicating that N-cadherin is required for Î²-cell granule turnover...|$|R
50|$|Cairns {{hypothesized}} a different, but complementary, {{mechanism of}} tumor suppression in 1975 based on tissue architecture {{to protect against}} selection of variant somatic cells with increased fitness in proliferating epithelial populations, such as the intestine and other <b>epithelial</b> <b>organs.</b> He postulated {{that this could be}} accomplished by restricting the number of stem cells for example at the base of intestinal crypts and restraining the opportunities for competition between cells by shedding differentiated intestinal cells into the gut. The essential predictions of this model have been confirmed although mutations in some tumor suppressor genes, including CDKN2A (p16), predispose to clonal expansions that encompass large numbers of crypts in some conditions such as Barrett's esophagus. He also postulated an immortal DNA strand that is discussed at Immortal DNA strand hypothesis.|$|R
40|$|Tenascin and {{fibronectin}} are {{two major}} extracellular matrix glycoproteins. They both consist of large disulfide-linked subunits composed of multiple structural domains. More than half of each molecule consists of so-called fibronectin type III repeats, but the other domains differ. Fibronectin is a dimer, whereas tenascin is a hexamer. Often fibronectin and tenascin are colocalized in tissues, but the occurrence of tenascin is much more restricted when compared with fibronectin. Tenascin is transiently expressed in many developing organs such as connective tissues, the mesenchyme of <b>epithelial</b> <b>organs,</b> and also the central and peripheral nervous systems, and it reappears in the stroma of many tumors. The distinctive and highly regulated expression of tenascin has provoked interest in trying to identify possible functions of tenascin in cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion, cell migration, growth, and cell differentiation during morphogenesis. - CHIQUET-EHRISMANN, R.
