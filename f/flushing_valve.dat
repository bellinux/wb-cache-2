40|$|This {{research}} in Langford Building 'A', Texas A&M University, {{is an attempt}} to determine the user satisfaction of the new, low consumption toilet fixtures and lavatory valves. 253 surveys were given to the subjects, during the four phases of upgrading the restroom fixtures, to find and compare user satisfaction in each phase. The four phases were: 1. 	The as-is condition of the <b>flush</b> <b>valves</b> and the lavatory valve. 2. 	Low consumption manual <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> and low consumption manual lavatory valve. 3. 	Old style low consumption automatic <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> and low consumption automatic lavatory valve. 4. 	Low consumption manual <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> and low consumption automatic lavatory valve.

50|$|Stainless steel {{strainers}} {{are used}} in industrial, municipal, and irrigation applications, and can be designed for very high flow rates. When paired with a controller and <b>flush</b> <b>valve,</b> a strainer can be fully automated. Suspended particles collect {{on the inside of}} the screen, and the <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> opens to expel the buildup. This eliminates the need for manual cleaning of the strainer element.|$|R
25|$|In tanks using a flapper-flush valve, {{the outlet}} {{at the bottom}} of the tank is covered by a buoyant (plastic or rubber) cover, or flapper, which is held in place against a fitting (the <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> seat) by water pressure. To flush the toilet, the user pushes a lever, which lifts the <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> from the valve seat. The valve then floats clear of the seat, {{allowing}} the tank to empty quickly into the bowl. As the water level drops, the floating <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> descends back to the bottom of the tank and covers the outlet pipe again. This system is common in homes in the US and in continental Europe. Recently this flush system has also become available in the UK due to a change in regulations.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{water supply}} installations, noise {{pollution}} often occurs. As a basic {{component of a}} system, a <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> may frequently {{be a source of}} noise and vibration generated by cavitation or high turbulence levels. During valve closing or valve opening, cavitation can be a problem. In order to decrease the noise and to improve the design inside a <b>flush</b> <b>valve,</b> some experimental and numerical analyses were carried out in our laboratories. These analyses led to some improvements {{in the design of the}} valves. Cavitation occurrence was more specifically addressed, using numerical simulation, and this is the main aim of the present paper. Particularly, the use of a simplified numerical test without cavitation model is compared with one using a cavitation model. In order to define potential cavitation risks in some parts of the valve, it has been found that a simplified approach provides an accurate overview. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of cavitating flow of water through an industrial <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> were performed using the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with a near-wall turbulence model. The flow was assumed turbulent, incompressible and steady. Two commercial CFD codes (Fluent 6. 3 and Star CCM+ 3. 04. 009) were used to analyse the effects of inlet pressure as well as mesh size and mesh type on cavitation intensity in the <b>flush</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In 1906, William Sloan {{first made}} his [...] "flushometer" [...] style toilet <b>flush</b> <b>valve,</b> {{incorporating}} his patented design, {{available to the}} public. The design proved to be very popular and efficient, and remains so to this day. Flushometer toilet <b>flush</b> <b>valves</b> are still often installed in commercial restrooms, and are frequently used for both toilets and urinals. Since they have no tank, they have zero recharge time, {{and can be used}} immediately by the next user of the toilet. They can be easily identified by their distinctive chrome pipe-work, and by the absence of a toilet tank or cistern, wherever they are employed.|$|R

30|$|This study deliberates two trial {{approaches}} for optimizing the flushing system design. Both are mechanically actuated by an external pedal mechanism.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the process}} of super heavy oil {{exploitation}} in Tahe oil field, when mixing light oil, due to heavy oil and light oil entering into pump from separator directly, the existing ESP string leads to poor mixing and heavy oil coming into the pump, as a result, the pump detection period is greatly shorten; when water injection-production, the injected water can contact with electrical cable and motor directly, causing serious damage to the cable and motor, and the pump detection period is also greatly shorten. This paper designs {{a new type of}} ESP string, adding a ESP dome, a sieve tube, a mixing device, an intelligent switch and a direct <b>flushing</b> <b>valve,</b> which can improve the mixing effect of heavy oil and light oil, avoid the injected water directly contacting with electrical cable and motor, {{in order to protect the}} electrical cable and motor, improve their service life, extend the pump detection period and reduce production costs.

30|$|Wasting {{water in}} toilets {{flushing}} {{is the largest}} source of water wasting {{through the use of}} old siphon boxes. It occupies the first place in domestic consumption. This study reports two trial approaches for optimizing the flushing system design. The first one employs a rotatable blade {{in the bottom of the}} bowl. This blade pushes materials in the bowl to cross the trapway thus; less toilet flushing water can be used. The second approach depends on using a rotatable trapway such that it can be tilted down to enable discharging materials in the bowl directly by its gravity. This facilitates the discharge and reduces the flushwater amount which is just used to overcome friction and to clean the passage. Both are mechanical systems actuated by an external pedal mechanism that triggers the water <b>flushing</b> <b>valve</b> system in the same time. Real experiments revealed that the first approach needs more developments to work efficiently. Experiments with restricted conditions revealed that with using the rotatable trapway system approach, less than one liter of flushwater is sufficient. The required flushwater flow rate can be obtained directly from the water supply system without the need to install siphon boxes. This study can help more to design better water saving systems.|$|E
50|$|The forerunner to {{the modern}} flush toilet had a <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> to let {{water out of the}} tank, and a wash-down design to empty the bowl. The term 'John', used {{particularly}} in the USA, is thought by some to be a reference to its inventor, however this is disputed.|$|R
25|$|This system, {{invented by}} Albert Giblin and {{common in the}} UK, uses a storage tank {{similar to that used}} in the flapper-flush-valve system above. This <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> system is {{sometimes}} referred to as a valveless system, since no traditional type of valve is required. Some would argue, however, that any system of regulating the flow of a fluid is still technically a valve. In the siphon-flush-valve system, the user pushes a lever or button, forcing the water up into the tank siphon passageway which then empties the water in the tank into the bowl. The advantage of a siphon over the <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> is that it has no sealing washers that can wear out and cause leaks, so it is favoured in places where {{there is a need to}} conserve water.|$|R

5000|$|Haas also focused {{considerable}} {{energy on}} improving the commercial <b>flush</b> <b>valve.</b> These efforts {{resulted in a}} series of patents issued throughout the late 1910s and early 1920s. On June 5, 1924 he submitted a patent application for a hydraulic <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> with many similarities to commercial fixtures in use today. It is characterized by a metal toggle knob protruding from a socket in the side of a cylindrical valve. In his application, Haas indicated [...] "the construction of the valve mechanism is simplified, rendered more efficient and certain of operation, and whereby the valve may be installed and adjusted to accommodate variations in the pressure of water available in the connected supply...." [...] The design is incorporated in Patent 1,614,468. Haas’ designs in this area have been cited in numerous patent applications over the intervening years.|$|R
40|$|Two {{stainless}} steel toilets using the 1. 6 gallon per <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> were tested and are documented in this report. One toilet is {{a version of}} the existing TDC water closet design (designated TDC 5) and represents a retrofit by changing the <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> from 4. 0 gallons to 1. 6 gallons and modifying the rinse ring holes. TDC 5 is intended for use within the Texas prison system only and does not satisfy the performance requirements of the ASME Standard at the specified operating pressure of 35 psi static. However, by raising the operating pressure to 65 psi static, all performance criteria specified in ASME Standard A 112. 19. 6 - 1990 are met. The second toilet tested is the new prototype toilet (designated ATM 7). This toilet is designed to meet all requirements as specified in the ASME Standard and is intended for use in new prison facilities. This toilet passed all performance criteria stated in the ASME Standard when operating with the 1. 6 gallon <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> at a static water pressure of 35 psi. However performance was very marginal and much improvement is possible. The flush line entrance diameter reduction to 1 / 4 " is too restrictive and forces an excessive amount of water to the rinse ring. A larger flush line entrance diameter is needed, to enhance the removal of solids without degrading the flush surface rinse performance...|$|R
25|$|In 1596, Sir John Harington (1561–1612) {{published}} A New Discourse of a Stale Subject, Called the Metamorphosis of Ajax, {{describing a}} forerunner {{to the modern}} flush toilet installed at his house at Kelston in Somerset. The design had a <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> to let {{water out of the}} tank, and a wash-down design to empty the bowl. He installed one for his godmother Queen Elizabeth I at Richmond Palace.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to its <b>flush</b> <b>valves</b> based on diaphragm technology, Sloan also introduced piston-type flushometers, including the Crown and the GEM 2. A special piston-type flushometer, called the Naval, was built for marine applications. In 1976, Sloan introduced the Optima line of sensor-activated flushometers (the first few were installed at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport); battery-powered equivalents under the name Optima Plus followed in 1991. Sloan also now has solar-powered models with a battery back-up that operate using any artificial or natural light source.|$|R
25|$|This is {{an older}} method of water-saving {{automatic}} flushing, which only operates when the room has been used. A push-button switch is {{mounted in the}} door frame of the restroom, and triggers the <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> for all restroom urinals every time the door is opened. While it cannot detect the use of individual urinals, it provides reasonable flushing action without wasting excessive amounts of water when the restroom is not being used. This method requires a spring-operated automatic door closer, since the flush mechanism only operates when the restroom door opens.|$|R
2500|$|Until recently, {{the use of}} siphon-type cisterns was {{mandatory}} in the UK to avoid the potential waste of water by millions of leaking toilets with flapper valves but due to EU harmonisation the regulations have changed. These valves can sometimes {{be more difficult to}} operate than a [...] "flapper"-based <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> because the lever requires more torque than a flapper-flush-valve system. This additional torque required at the tank lever {{is due to the fact}} that a user must forcefully lift a certain amount of water up into the siphon passageway in order to initiate the siphon action in the tank.|$|R
25|$|The newer concentric-float {{fill valve}} {{consists}} of a tower which is encircled by a plastic float assembly. Operation is otherwise {{the same as a}} side-float fill valve, even though the float position is somewhat different. By virtue of its more compact layout, interference between the float and other obstacles (tank insulation, <b>flush</b> <b>valve,</b> and so on) is greatly reduced, thus increasing reliability. The concentric-float fill valve is also designed to signal to users automatically when there is a leak in the tank, by making much more noise when a leak is present than the older style side-float fill valve, which tends to be nearly silent when a slow leak is present.|$|R
25|$|Some {{flushometer}} models {{require the}} user to either depress a lever or press a button, which in turn opens a <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> allowing mains-pressure water to flow directly into the toilet bowl or urinal. Other flushometer models are electronically triggered, using an infrared sensor to initiate the flushing process. Typically, on electronically triggered models, an override button is provided in case the user wishes to manually trigger flushing earlier. Some electronically triggered models also incorporate a true mechanical manual override {{which can be used}} in the event of the failure of the electronic system. In retrofit installations, a self-contained battery-powered or hard-wired unit can be added to an existing manual flushometer to flush automatically when a user departs.|$|R
50|$|In October 1993, toilet fixture {{manufacturers}} reported rapid {{degradation of}} <b>flush</b> <b>valve</b> flappers; some new, water-saving toilets (introduced {{to meet a}} 1994 US federal water conservation deadline) were leaking within months of installation. The growing popularity of in-tank drop-in cleaning tablets quickly drew suspicion as many contain chlorine bleach; if a toilet is flushed infrequently, the amount of chlorine in the tank may build to problematic levels. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) began tests of flapper materials in 1994-1997. By 1998, flappers had been redesigned to withstand continuous immersion in 2000 Flushes or Clorox bowl cleaners, then the most popular products. A rival in-tank cleaner introduced by Vanish in 2000 caused problems until new durability and marking requirements for flappers {{were added to the}} ASME A112.19.5 standard in 2005.|$|R
