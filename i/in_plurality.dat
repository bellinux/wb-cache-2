5|$|As Dean of Christchurch, Hilary {{restored}} the organisation to its traditional round of religious ceremonies {{that had been}} abandoned by his predecessors, as well as securing grants of privileges and lands. He ordered the writing {{of a history of}} the church at Christchurch, a book which still survives. Hilary was unsuccessful as a candidate for the archbishopric of York against Henry Murdac in 1147, but Pope Eugene III chose to compensate him by appointing him to the see of Chichester. His candidacy to York had been supported by Hugh de Puiset, then treasurer of York and later Bishop of Durham, and by Robert of Ghent, who was Dean of York and Lord Chancellor of England, as well as by King Stephen of England. Hilary seems to have received the largest number of votes, but because the election was disputed by Murdac's supporters the result was referred to the papacy, and Eugene chose Murdac. Hilary was appointed to Chichester in July 1147, and he was consecrated on 3 August 1147. Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, consecrated him at Canterbury, with Nigel, the Bishop of Ely, Robert, the Bishop of Bath, and William de Turbeville, the Bishop of Norwich, assisting in the ceremony. For a number of years, Hilary continued to hold the deanship <b>in</b> <b>plurality,</b> which is the holding of two ecclesiastical benefices at once.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} rebellions {{broke out in}} late 1067 William adopted a policy of {{conciliation}} towards the church. He gave Stigand a place at court, as well as giving administrative positions to Ealdred of York and Æthelwig, Abbot of Evesham. Archbishop Stigand appears {{on a number of}} royal charters in 1069, along with both Norman and English leaders. He even consecrated Remigius de Fécamp as Bishop of Dorcester in 1067. Once the danger of rebellion was past, however, William had no further need of Stigand. At a council held at Winchester at Easter 1070, the bishops met with papal legates from Alexander II. On 11 April 1070 Stigand was deposed by the papal legate, Ermenfrid, Bishop of Sion in the Alps, and was imprisoned at Winchester. His brother Æthelmær, Bishop of Elmham, was also deposed at the same council. Shortly afterwards Aethelric the Bishop of Selsey, Ethelwin the Bishop of Durham and Leofwin Bishop of Lichfield, who was married, were deposed at a council held at Windsor. There were three reasons given for Stigand's deposition: that he held the bishopric of Winchester <b>in</b> <b>plurality</b> with Canterbury; that he not only occupied Canterbury after Robert of Jumièges fled but also seized Robert's pallium which was left behind; and that he received his own pallium from Benedict X, an anti-pope. Some accounts state that Stigand did appear at the council which deposed him, but nothing is recorded of any defence that he attempted. The charges against his brother are nowhere stated, leading to a belief that the depositions were mainly political. That spring he had deposited his personal wealth at Ely Abbey for safekeeping, but King William confiscated it after his deposition, along with his estates. The king appointed Lanfranc, a native of Italy and a scholar and abbot in Normandy, as the new archbishop.|$|E
25|$|The church {{interior}} was restored in the 18th century when box pews were replaced with oak pews {{to give a}} seating capacity of 1,000. The church was extensively damaged during World War II; in 1940 the chancel was destroyed by a stray bomb; being re-built after {{the war in the}} early English style and removing the Victorian 'restoration' of the east end. Rectors include Thomas Wolsey (who later became Cardinal) though it is doubtful that he ever attended, as he held a number of churches <b>in</b> <b>plurality,</b> employing a curate and keeping the tithes for himself.|$|E

500|$|In 1002 Wulfstan {{was elected}} Archbishop of York and was {{immediately}} translated to that see. Holding York also brought him control over the diocese of Worcester, as at {{that time it was}} practice in England to hold [...] "the potentially disaffected northern archbishopric <b>in</b> <b>plurality</b> with a southern see." [...] He held both Worcester and York until 1016, resigning Worcester to Leofsige while retaining York. There is evidence, however, that he retained influence over Worcester even after this time, and that Leofsige perhaps acted [...] "only as a suffragan to Wulfstan." [...] Although holding two or more episcopal sees <b>in</b> <b>plurality</b> was both uncanonical and against the spirit of the Benedictine Reform, Wulfstan had inherited this practice from previous archbishops of York, and he was not the last to hold York and Worcester <b>in</b> <b>plurality.</b>|$|E
500|$|Foliot {{switched}} his allegiance on {{his return}} to England and swore fealty to Stephen, angering the Angevins. Theobald managed to secure peace between the parties, saying that Foliot could not refuse to swear homage [...] "to the prince approved by the papacy". Foliot also attempted to hold Hereford <b>in</b> <b>plurality,</b> or at the same time, with the abbey of Gloucester, but the monks of Gloucester objected. Rather than accept {{a situation like that}} of Henry of Blois, who held the Diocese of Winchester as well as being Abbot of Glastonbury, the monks of Gloucester held an election three weeks after Foliot's selection as bishop, and chose their prior as the new abbot.|$|E
500|$|Wulfstan (sometimes Lupus; died 28 May 1023) was an English Bishop of London, Bishop of Worcester, and Archbishop of York. He {{should not}} be {{confused}} with Wulfstan I, Archbishop of York, or Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester. [...] He is thought to have begun his ecclesiastical career as a Benedictine monk. He became the Bishop of London in 996. In 1002 he was elected simultaneously to the diocese of Worcester and the archdiocese of York, holding both <b>in</b> <b>plurality</b> until 1016, when he relinquished Worcester; he remained archbishop of York until his death. It was perhaps while he was at London that he first became well known as a writer of sermons, or homilies, on the topic of Antichrist. In 1014, as archbishop, he wrote his most famous work, a homily which he titled the Sermo Lupi ad Anglos, or the Sermon of the Wolf to the English.|$|E

500|$|Earl Godwin's {{rebellion}} against the king in 1051 came as a blow to Ealdred, who was {{a supporter of the}} earl and his family. Ealdred was present at the royal council at London that banished Godwin's family. Later in 1051, when he was sent to intercept Harold Godwinson and his brothers as they fled England after their father's outlawing, Ealdred [...] "could not, or would not" [...] capture the brothers. The banishment of Ealdred's patron came shortly after the death of Ælfric Puttoc, the Archbishop of York. York and Worcester had long had close ties, and the two sees had often been held <b>in</b> <b>plurality,</b> or at the same time. Ealdred probably wanted to become Archbishop of York after Ælfric's death, but his patron's eclipse led to the king appointing Cynesige, a royal chaplain, instead. In September 1052, though, Godwin returned from exile and his family was restored to power. By late 1053 Ealdred was once more in royal favour. At some point, he was alleged to have accompanied Swein on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but proof is lacking.|$|E
500|$|Geoffrey {{formally}} resigned the see of Lincoln on 6 January 1182, at Marlborough in England, {{rather than}} be ordained as Pope Lucius III had ordered. Henry had named him Chancellor of England in 1181, after Geoffrey indicated {{he was going to}} resign the bishopric in February 1181. Although Geoffrey resigned the episcopal office, he continued to hold benefices <b>in</b> <b>plurality,</b> which was normally contrary to canon law. These offices included the Treasurer of York from 1182, the Archdeaconry of Rouen from 1183, and probably the Archdeaconry of East Riding. Henry also gave him two continental castles, one in Anjou and one in Touraine, along with lands in England and Normandy worth 1000 marks a year. Although Geoffrey held the office of Chancellor, he appears in only few documents, mainly between 1182 and 1185. After 1185 he does not appear in any contemporary documents until 1187, and it is possible that he spent some time outside his father's domains. Peter of Blois wrote that several monarchs considered Geoffrey as a possible successor for their kingdoms in Italy or the Holy Land, and that he was actually offered the throne of Jerusalem by Heraclius, the Patriarch of Jerusalem. It is possible that Geoffrey's non-appearance in documents was due to his absence from his father's domains in pursuit of these ambitions. During Geoffrey's term of office as Chancellor Walter de Coutances served as his [...] "seal-keeper"; the need for someone to perform this function adds further evidence to the likelihood that Geoffrey's time as Chancellor was spent on unrelated duties for his father. William Longchamp fulfilled the same assistant role for the archdeaconry at Rouen.|$|E
2500|$|Zeno's paradoxes are {{a set of}} {{philosophical}} problems generally {{thought to have been}} devised by Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea (ca. 490–430 BC) to support Parmenides' doctrine that contrary to the evidence of one's senses, the belief <b>in</b> <b>plurality</b> and change is mistaken, and in particular that motion is nothing but an illusion. [...] It is usually assumed, based on Plato's Parmenides (128a–d), that Zeno took on the project of creating these paradoxes because other philosophers had created paradoxes against Parmenides' view. [...] Thus Plato has Zeno say the purpose of the paradoxes [...] "is to show that their hypothesis that existences are many, if properly followed up, leads to still more absurd results than the hypothesis that they are one." [...] (Parmenides 128d). [...] Plato has Socrates claim that Zeno and Parmenides were essentially arguing exactly the same point (Parmenides 128a–b).|$|E
