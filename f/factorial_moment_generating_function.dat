40|$|We {{propose a}} concise {{stochastic}} mechanics framework for chemical reaction systems that allows to formulate evolution equations for three general types of data: the probability <b>generating</b> <b>functions,</b> the exponential <b>moment</b> <b>generating</b> <b>functions</b> and the <b>factorial</b> <b>moment</b> <b>generating</b> <b>functions.</b> This formulation constitutes an intimate synergy between techniques of statistical physics and of combinatorics. We demonstrate how to analytically solve the evolution equations for all six elementary types of single-species chemical reactions by either combinatorial normal-ordering techniques, or, for the binary reactions, {{by means of}} Sobolev-Jacobi orthogonal polynomials. The former set of results in particular highlights the relationship between infinitesimal generators of stochastic evolution and parametric transformations fo probability distributions. Moreover, we present exact results for generic single-species non-binary reactions, hinting at a notion of compositionality of the analytic techniques. Comment: 32 + 10 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: In many queuing {{situations}} {{the average}} arrival and service rates vary over time. In those situations a transient {{solution for the}} state probabilities and mean and variance must be obtained. Approach: The mean and the variance of a particular infinite server model will be obtained using the state differential-difference equations and the <b>factorial</b> <b>moment</b> <b>generating</b> <b>function.</b> The average arrival and service rates will be taken {{to be dependent on}} time. The individual customer interarrival times and service time are assumed to be exponentially distributed. This is known as the Markovian system. Results: The mean and variance of the system will be established as solutions to two sequential linear ordinary differential equations. A comparison is also made to a previously known result for the corresponding system with a finite number of servers. Conclusion: Simple closed-form equations for the mean and variance of the system are presented...|$|E

40|$|The <b>moment</b> <b>generating</b> <b>function</b> of {{the number}} of points played using a {{particular}} scoring system can be used to estimate the actual distribution {{of the number}} of points played. Estimates can also be made of the tails of the distribution, so that an estimate can be made of the proportion of time very long matches will occur. In this paper an explicit expression for the <b>moment</b> <b>generating</b> <b>function</b> {{of the number of}} points in a game of tennis conditional on the server winning (and conditional on the server losing) is derived. These expressions are used to detennine an explicit expression for the <b>moment</b> <b>generating</b> <b>function</b> of the number of points in a set of tennis conditional on player A winning (and conditional on player A losing) in an odd (and in an even) number of games. Finally, an explicit expression for the <b>moment</b> <b>generating</b> <b>function</b> of the number of points in a best of three advantage sets match of tennis is determined. The Normal Power Approximation and the first four moments from the <b>moment</b> <b>generating</b> <b>function</b> can be used to estimate the distribution of the number of points, which can then be used to estimate some useful statistics for a tennis match. Importantly, the methods in this paper can be used to determine the <b>moment</b> <b>generating</b> <b>function</b> of the number of points for any tennis scoring system, or indeed to determine the <b>moment</b> <b>generating</b> <b>function</b> for nested scoring sytems for many other sports...|$|R
