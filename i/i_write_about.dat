25|$|The {{books of}} those that wrote before us survive, and {{therefore}} we are taught about what was written then. For this reason it is good that we also in our time, here among us, write some material from scratch, inspired by the example of these old customs; so that it might, when we are dead and elsewhere, {{be left to the}} world's ear in the time coming after this. But because men say, and it's true, that when someone writes entirely about wisdom, it often dulls a man's wit who reads it every day. For that reason, if you permit it, I would like to take the middle way, and write a book between the two, somewhat of passion, somewhat of instruction, that whether of high or low status, people may like what <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E

500|$|The lyrics for {{the album}} were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. He has {{often called the}} album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, [...] "I would think all day, for days and days, [...] what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in {{different}} ways. I don’t know why these kids love the tragedies that <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>about.</b> I guess they can relate to it." [...] Also on the writing process, Radke said that his lyrics were much more evolved than his past works and that he felt this was a high-point for the post-hardcore genre, owing success to being incarcerated and writing lyrics for two years with no other musical influences. The title, The Drug in Me Is You, came from Radke's experiences concerning his previous self-destructive behavior, which Radke explained that, [...] "We named it that because ... It's me, looking in the mirror, saying, 'I am my own worst [...] I do the worst damage to myself — {{more than anybody else}} can to do me.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Dance in the Rain is the {{follow-up}} to Coulter's third studio album Fear & Freedom (2012), which debuted at number seven on the ARIAAlbumsChart and became her first top-ten album. Coulter {{began working on}} Dance in the Rain shortly {{after the completion of}} Fear & Freedom. As executive producer of Dance in the Rain, Coulter had full control over the songwriters and producers she wanted to work with. She also spent her own money to travel overseas to write and record material for the album. Coulter intended for DanceintheRain to be an honest album and wanted to avoid following a certain sound and concept. She worked on it for two years in various places around the world, including Bali, Brisbane, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Nashville, New York City, Paris, Sweden and Sydney. Stuart Crichton co-produced a majority of the album's songs alongside Coulter. Speaking of the inspiration behind Dance in the Rain, Coulter stated: [...] "Life throws so much at you and <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> it all...I figured I had a lot to say and there were so many things I wanted to express – and I managed to pull it all together for this one album." ...|$|E

50|$|Before {{publishing}} The Lion Feeds, Smith {{was working}} as an accountant and had already written a novel, The Gods First Make Mad, {{for which he had}} been unable to find a publisher. After his first marriage failed, he tried again with a different story:I <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> my own father and my darling mother. I wove into the story chunks of early African history. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> black people and white. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> hunting and gold mining and carousing and women. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> love and loving and hating. In short <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> all the things I knew well and loved better. I left out all the immature philosophies and radical politics and rebellious posturing that had been the backbone of the first novel. I even came up with a catching title, 'When the Lion Feeds'.His agent in London, Ursula Winant, managed to sell the book to William Heinemann for an advance of 2000 pounds and an initial print run of 10,000 copies. The book went on to be successful, selling around the world (except in South Africa, where it was banned) and enabling Smith to leave his job and work full-time. Charles Pick, who bought the book for Heinemann, later became Smith's mentor and agent.|$|R

50|$|Smith {{turned back}} to fiction, this time {{determined}} to write it, and {{found that he was}} able to sell his first story to Argozy magazine for 70 pounds, twice his monthly salary. His first attempt at a novel, The Gods First Make Mad, was rejected, so for a time he returned to work as an accountant, until the urge to write once again overwhelmed him. He tried another novel:I <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> my own father and my darling mother. I wove into the story chunks of early African history. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> black people and white. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> hunting and gold mining and carousing and women. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> love and loving and hating. In short <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>about</b> all the things I knew well and loved better. I left out all the immature philosophies and radical politics and rebellious posturing that had been the backbone of the first novel. I even came up with a catching title, When the Lion Feeds.When the Lion Feeds tells the stories of two young men, twins Sean and Garrick Courtney. The characters' surname was a tribute to Smith's grandfather, Courtney James Smith, who had commanded a Maxim gun team during the Zulu Wars. Courtney James Smith had a magnificent mustache and could tell wonderful stories that had helped inspire Wilbur.|$|R

60|$|My poor, dear, unhappy Mary! {{the worst}} I feared {{for you on}} that night when I sat up alone was far below the dreadful {{calamity}} that has really happened.

60|$|And, ere I begin, I {{must ask}} {{the reader to}} walk with me in all sympathy; and, since sympathy is merely {{understanding}}, begin by understanding me and whom and what <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>about.</b> In the first place, I am a seasoned drinker. I have no constitutional predisposition for alcohol. I am not stupid. I am not a swine. I know the drinking game from A to Z, and I have used my judgment in drinking.

And this is the very point: I am writing of the effects of alcohol on the normal, average man. I have no word to say for or about the microscopically unimportant excessivist, the dipsomaniac.|$|E

6000|$|All {{this talk}} is partly to persuade you that I write to {{you out of}} good feeling only, {{which is not the}} case. I am a beggar; ask Dobson, Saintsbury, yourself, and any other of these cheeses who know {{something}} of the eighteenth century, what became of Jean Cavalier between his coming to England and his death in 1740. Is anything interesting known about him? Whom did he marry? The happy French, smilingly following one another in a long procession headed by the loud and empty Napoleon Peyrat, say, Olympe Dunoyer, Voltaire's old flame. Vacquerie even thinks that they were rivals, and is very French and very literary and very silly in his comments. Now I may almost say it consists with my knowledge that all this has not a shadow to rest upon. It is very odd and very annoying; I have splendid materials for Cavalier till he comes to my own country; and there, though he continues to advance in the service, he becomes entirely invisible to me. Any information about him will be greatly welcome: I may mention that I know as much as I desire about the other prophets, Marion, Fage, Cavalier (de Sonne), my Cavalier's cousin, the unhappy Lions, and the idiotic Mr. Lacy; so if any erudite starts upon that track, you may choke him off. If you can find aught for me, or if you will but try, count on my undying gratitude. Lang's [...] "Library" [...] is very pleasant reading. My book will reach you soon, for <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> it to-day.--Yours ever, ...|$|E

Before morning I was in a fever; and from that time I can remember nothing clearly till I came to my senses at this place, and found myself under the care of a Hungarian merchant, the consignee (as they call it) of the coasting vessel that had picked me up. He speaks English as well or better than I do; and he has treated me with a kindness which I can find no words to praise.
