5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} measures <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>implemented,</b> including site access restrictions, {{the collection and}} cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E

5|$|CPAs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> for the {{management}} of a plethora of chronic disease states, including diabetes mellitus, asthma, and hypertension. Evidence suggests that CPAs have resulted in beneficial health outcomes for patients involved. It has been shown that pharmacists working with providers under CPAs help deliver higher quality of care in the setting of psychiatry to promote medication adherence, managing venous thromboembolism in outpatient clinics, and in the oncology setting, including {{the management}} of antiemetic (anti-vomiting) therapy. Within these settings, CPAs have resulted in improved attainment of goal laboratory values like hemoglobin A1c for diabetics, improved lung function for asthmatics, and improved blood pressure control for people with hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads are {{considered}} {{an endangered species}} and are protected by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Untended fishing gear is responsible for many loggerhead deaths. Turtles may also suffocate if they are trapped in fishing trawls. Turtle excluder devices <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> in efforts to reduce mortality by providing an escape route for the turtles. Loss of suitable nesting beaches {{and the introduction of}} exotic predators have also taken a toll on loggerhead populations. Efforts to restore their numbers will require international cooperation, since the turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered across several countries.|$|E
5|$|Per , {{state and}} union governments, as duty, shall make further {{detailed}} policies and laws for implementation considering DPSPs as fundamental policy. In contrary to Article 37, many policies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> {{by state and}} union governments which go against the DPSPs such as using intoxicating drinks as source of major tax revenue instead of implementing prohibition for better health of people, separation of judiciary from executive, uniform civil code for the citizen, etc. When the union government feels that a DPSP is no longer useful to the nation, it shall be deleted from Constitution by bringing {{a constitutional amendment to}} remove ambiguity in policy making / direction. Judiciary can repeal any policy/law devised by the government which is diametrically opposite to any DPSP.|$|E

5|$|The {{town has}} an {{underground}} sewage system, covering about 40% {{of the town}} area, that collects domestic waste and conveys it to septic tanks for disposal. Solid waste is disposed of in a nearby dumping ground, which also houses the town's crematorium.

Vermicomposting of vegetable waste is carried out {{with the help of}} non-governmental organisations. In June 2009, in order to reduce waste, the municipality proposed a ban on plastic carrier bags and sachets in the town.|$|E
5|$|Following lengthy {{discussions between}} Royal Mail {{managers}} and union representatives {{a deal to}} settle the dispute was finally agreed to on 8 March 2010. This would see Royal Mail workers receiving a 6.9% pay rise over three years (worth 2% in 2010, 1.4% in 2011 and 3.5% in 2012), while extra payments worth up to £1,400 would be made to full-time workers once all the agreed changes have been made. These will {{take the form of a}} £400 payment following the agreement of union members and a further £1,000 to be paid once the planned changes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>implemented.</b> In addition the Royal Mail agreed to keep 75% of the workforce as full-time, rather than part-time staff, and to reduce working hours from 40 to 39 hours a week. In exchange, the CWU agreed to Royal Mail's modernisation strategy which include plans to introduce the automated walk sequencing machinery.|$|E
5|$|Plan 9 {{demonstrated}} that an integral concept of Unix—that every system interface could be {{represented as a}} set of files—could be successfully implemented in a modern distributed system. Some features from Plan 9, like the UTF-8 character encoding of Unicode, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> in other operating systems. Unix-like operating systems such as Linux have implemented 9P, Plan 9's file system, and have adopted features of rfork, Plan 9's process creation mechanism. Additionally, in Plan 9 from User Space, several of Plan 9's applications and tools, including the sam and acme editors, have been ported to Unix and Linux systems and have achieved some level of popularity. Several projects seek to replace the GNU operating system programs surrounding the Linux kernel with the Plan 9 operating system programs. The 9wm window manager was inspired by 8½, the older windowing system of Plan 9; wmii is also heavily influenced by Plan 9.|$|E

5|$|The blacktip shark {{is popular}} with {{recreational}} anglers in Florida, the Caribbean, and South Africa. It {{is listed as}} a game fish by the International Game Fish Association. Once hooked, this species is a strong, steady fighter that sometimes {{jumps out of the}} water. Since 1995, the number of blacktip sharks taken by recreational anglers in the United States has approached or surpassed the number taken by commercial fishing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip shark as Near Threatened, as its low reproductive rate renders it vulnerable to overfishing. The United States and Australia are the only two countries that manage fisheries catching blacktip sharks. In both cases, regulation occurs under umbrella management schemes for multiple shark species, such as that for the large coastal sharks category of the US National Marine Fisheries Service Atlantic shark Fisheries Management Plan. No conservation plans specifically for this species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>implemented.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} the developers of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, leveling up, Survival mode, Combat mode, and Hard mode. The dual-screen play was removed, with the developers commenting that while it could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>implemented,</b> it {{did not need to}} be, and the full use of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability to level up players' Commanding Officers was introduced in Days of Ruins predecessor, , the developers commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability to level up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not fitting with the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard mode was removed due to the developers feeling that the Normal mode was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this mode by doing a good job was effectively the same as Hard mode.|$|E
