2500|$|Through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, various {{methods to}} improve the dynamic range of mass-produced records {{involved}} highly advanced disc cutting equipment. These techniques, marketed, to name two, as the CBS DisComputer and Teldec Direct Metal Mastering, were used to reduce inner-groove distortion. RCA Victor introduced another system to reduce dynamic range and achieve a groove with less surface noise under the commercial name of Dynagroove. Two main elements were combined: another disk material with less surface noise in the groove and <b>dynamic</b> <b>compression</b> for masking background noise. Sometimes this was called [...] "diaphragming" [...] the source material and not favoured by some music lovers for its unnatural side effects. Both elements were reflected in the brandname of Dynagroove, described elsewhere in more detail. It also used the earlier advanced method of forward-looking control on groove spacing with respect to volume of sound and position on the disk. Lower recorded volume used closer spacing; higher recorded volume used wider spacing, especially with lower frequencies. Also, the higher track density at lower volumes enabled disk recordings to end {{farther away from the}} disk center than usual, helping to reduce endtrack distortion even further.|$|E

40|$|The performance, reliability, and {{ubiquity of}} {{automatic}} speech recognition systems has flourished in recent years due to steadily increasing computational power and technological innovations such as hidden Markov models, weighted finite-state transducers, and deep learning methods. One problem which plagues speech recognition systems, especially those that operate offline and have been trained on specific in-domain data, is the deleterious effect of noise on the accuracy of speech recognition. Historically, robust speech recognition {{research has focused on}} traditional noise types such as additive noise, linear filtering, and reverberation. This thesis describes the effects of nonlinear <b>dynamic</b> range <b>compression</b> on {{automatic speech recognition}} and develops a number of novel techniques for characterizing and counteracting it. <b>Dynamic</b> range <b>compression</b> is any function which reduces the dynamic range of an input signal. <b>Dynamic</b> range <b>compression</b> is a widely-used tool in audio engineering and is almost always a component of a practical telecommunications system. Despite its ubiquity, this thesis is the first work to comprehensively study and address the effect of <b>dynamic</b> range <b>compression</b> on speech recognition. More specifically, this thesis treats the problem of <b>dynamic</b> range <b>compression</b> in three ways: (1) blind amplitude normalization methods, which counteract <b>dynamic</b> range <b>compression</b> when its parameter values allow the function to be mathematically inverted, (2) blind amplitude reconstruction techniques, i. e., declipping, which attempt to reconstruct clipped segments of the speech signal that are lost through non-invertible <b>dynamic</b> range <b>compression,</b> and (3) matched-training techniques, which attempt to select the pre-trained acoustic model with the closest set of compression parameters. All three of these methods rely on robust estimation of the <b>dynamic</b> range <b>compression</b> distortion parameters. Novel algorithms for the blind prediction of these parameters are also introduced. The algorithms 2 ̆ 7 quality is evaluated in terms {{of the degree to which}} they decrease speech recognition word error rate, as well as in terms of the degree to which they increase a given speech signal 2 ̆ 7 s signal-to-noise ratio.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} <b>dynamic</b> cardiac <b>compression</b> on left {{ventricular}} contractile efficiency was assessed {{in terms of}} the pressure-volume relationship and myocardial oxygen consumption. In 11 excised cross-circulated dog hearts, the ventricle was directly compressed during systole (<b>dynamic</b> cardiac <b>compression).</b> Measurements for pressure-volume area (a measure of total mechanical energy), external work, and myocardial oxygen consumption were done before and during <b>dynamic</b> cardiac <b>compression.</b> <b>Dynamic</b> cardiac <b>compression</b> increased pressure-volume area by 28 % ± 17 % (mean plus or minus the standard deviation) and external work by 24 % ± 20 % (p = 0. 0000185 and 0. 0000212, respectively) at given end-diastolic and stroke volumes without affecting myocardial oxygen consumption. As a result, the oxygen cost of pressure-volume area, that is, the slope of the myocardial oxygen consumption–pressure-volume area relationship, significantly decreased by 16 % ± 13 % (p = 0. 0000135) whereas the pressure-volume area–independent myocardial oxygen consumption was unchanged. Then, contractile efficiency, that is, the reciprocal of the slope of the myocardial oxygen consumption–pressure-volume area relationship in joules significantly improved from 45 % ± 8 % to 53 % ± 13 % (p = 0. 0000437). When the native myocardial oxygen consumption–pressure-volume area relationship was assessed by subtracting the <b>dynamic</b> cardiac <b>compression</b> pressure applied to the heart, the slope of the myocardial oxygen consumption–pressure-volume area relationship returned to the control level. This indicates that the contractile efficiency of the native heart was not affected by <b>dynamic</b> cardiac <b>compression.</b> We conclude that <b>dynamic</b> cardiac <b>compression</b> enhances left ventricular pump function by improving the contractile efficiency of the overall heart leaving the energetics of the native heart unchanged.

50|$|A <b>dynamic</b> <b>compression</b> plate (DCP) is a {{metallic}} plate used in orthopedics for internal fixation of bone, typically after fractures. As the name implies, {{it is designed}} to exert dynamic pressure between the bone fragments to be transfixed. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>compression</b> is achieved either by attaching a tension device to a plate or by using a special <b>dynamic</b> <b>compression</b> plate. However, compression plating requires a longer surgical incision to allow insertion of the tension device and the possibility of refracture after the plate is removed. A neutralization plate is used to bridge a comminuted fracture; it also transmits bending or torsional forces from the proximal to the distal fragment. Plates used for buttressing prevent collapse by supporting an area of thin cortex or cancellous bone graft.|$|E

The absolute cylinder pressure {{is the result of}} an exponent of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>compression</b> ratio. This exponent is a polytropic value for the ratio of variable heats for air and similar gases at the temperatures present. This compensates for the temperature rise caused by compression, as well as heat lost to the cylinder. Under ideal (adiabatic) conditions, the exponent would be 1.4, but a lower value, generally between 1.2 and 1.3 is used, since the amount of heat lost will vary among engines based on design, size and materials used, but provides useful results for purposes of comparison. For example, if the static compression ratio is 10:1, and the <b>dynamic</b> <b>compression</b> ratio is 7.5:1, a useful value for cylinder pressure would be (7.5)^1.3 × atmospheric pressure, or 13.7 bar.

40|$|The {{process of}} audio {{mastering}} often, if not always, includes various audio signal processing {{techniques such as}} frequency equalisation and <b>dynamic</b> range <b>compression.</b> With respect to the genre and style of the audio content, the parameters of these techniques are controlled by a mastering engineer, in order to process the original audio material. This operation relies on musical and perceptually pleasing facets of the perceived acoustic characteristics, transmitted from the audio material under the mastering process.
