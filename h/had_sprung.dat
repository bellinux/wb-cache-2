Thomas's {{daughter}} Mary, 8, died {{within months of}} the wedding after a short illness. Once again, the burial society payout was collected upon death, this time by Margaret Higgins.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, more {{resistance}} movements {{supported by}} Ethiopia's communist Derg administration <b>had</b> <b>sprung</b> {{up across the}} country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative center of Hargeisa, a Somali National Movement (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{the line}} lay unused and in disrepair, but the riveted-steel {{elevated}} structure was structurally sound. Around this time, the structure became known {{to a few}} urban explorers and local residents for the tough, drought-tolerant wild grasses, shrubs, and rugged trees such as sumac that <b>had</b> <b>sprung</b> up in the gravel along the abandoned railway. It was slated for demolition under the administration of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani.|$|E

5|$|The first church {{building}} was erected in 1886 in Oconto, Wisconsin, by local women who believed Christian Science had helped them. For {{a down payment}} of $2,000 and a mortgage of $8,763, the church purchased land in Falmouth Street, Boston, for the erection of a building. Eddy asked Augusta Stetson, a prominent Scientist, to establish a church in New York. By the end of 1886 Christian Science teaching institutes <b>had</b> <b>sprung</b> up around the United States.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the city}} walls, suburbs <b>had</b> <b>sprung</b> up {{providing}} {{homes for the}} craftsmen and tradespeople who flocked to the already overcrowded city. These were shanty towns with wooden shacks and no sanitation. The government had tried to control this development but had failed and {{over a quarter of}} a million people lived here. Other immigrants had taken over fine town houses, vacated by Royalists who had fled the country during the Commonwealth, converting them into tenements with different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested slums.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} the SI was the diversity of units that <b>had</b> <b>sprung</b> up within the CGS systems and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them. The CGPM, which was established by the Metre Convention of 1875, brought together many international organisations to not only agree on the definitions and standards of the new system but also agree on the rules for writing and presenting measurements in a standardised manner around the world.|$|E

5|$|The prosperous {{industry}} which <b>had</b> <b>sprung</b> {{up around}} the new iron industry required vast numbers of largely unskilled workers to mine ironstone {{and work in the}} blast furnace plants. Coatbridge therefore became a popular destination for vast numbers of Irish (especially from County Donegal in Ulster) arriving in Scotland. The iron bars and plates produced in Coatbridge iron works were the raw materials needed throughout the British Empire for railways, construction, bridge building and shipbuilding. One example of uses Coatbridge' iron was put to included armour plating for British ships fighting in the Crimean War.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} {{the civil}} war, Henry's {{government}} faced the task of rebuilding royal authority across large parts of the country. By the end of 1217 many former rebels were routinely ignoring instructions from the centre, and even Henry's loyalist supporters jealously maintained their independent control over royal castles. Illegally constructed fortifications, called adulterine castles, <b>had</b> <b>sprung</b> up across much of the country. The network of county sheriffs had collapsed, and with it the ability to raise taxes and collect royal revenues. The powerful Welsh Prince Llywelyn posed a major threat in Wales and along the Welsh Marches.|$|E
5|$|Requiring funding, Castro {{toured the}} U.S. {{in search of}} wealthy sympathizers; Prío contributed $100,000. Castro later claimed {{that he had been}} {{monitored}} by Batista's agents, who orchestrated a failed assassination against him. Batista's government bribed Mexican police to arrest the rebels, however with the support of several Mexican politicians who were sympathetic to their cause, they were soon released. Castro kept in contact with the MR-26-7 in Cuba, where they had gained a large support base in Oriente. Other militant anti-Batista groups <b>had</b> <b>sprung</b> up, primarily from the student movement; most notable was the Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil (DRE), founded by the Federation of University Students (FEU) President José Antonio Echevarría. Antonio traveled to Mexico City to meet with Castro, but they disagreed on tactics; Antonio thought that it was legitimate to assassinate anyone connected to the government, something Castro thought rash and ineffective.|$|E

5|$|The revolt {{started in}} Nablus with the Palestinian general strike in April 1936. The strike spread {{to a number}} of cities {{throughout}} Palestine, including Tulkarm where al-Hajj Muhammad helped organize the campaign. By the summer of that year, several Palestinian Arab rebel bands <b>had</b> <b>sprung</b> up, including the forces of al-Hajj Muhammad. The latter used existing social networks and the complex web of local clan politics to build alliances both with the middle classes of the major towns, particularly the well-educated activists, and the rural clan elders to build a solid base of resistance against the British. In order to avoid detection, al-Hajj Muhammad refrained from commanding a large unit of troops. Instead, he raised small, semi-permanent bands of volunteers called fasa'il (sing. fasl) as he moved from one area to another. They normally launched nighttime attacks against specific targets.|$|E
