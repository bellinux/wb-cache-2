The current philosophy of housing for people with developmental disabilities focuses on the promotion of personal choice and the integration of this population into the community rather than living in an institutional setting.

Currently, there is no information oriented toward <b>housing</b> <b>authorities</b> that explains their potential role in furthering the goals of community integration for people with developmental disabilities.

40|$|This {{document}} {{proposes a}} strategy for Environmental Defense Fund to increase energy efficiency investment in public housing. Improving the energy efficiency of public housing buildings represents a tremendous opportunity to decrease energy consumption nationwide. In 2010, PHA-paid energy expenditures totaled more than $ 1 billion, a similar magnitude to the $ 3. 6 billion the U. S. Department of Defense spends on energy consumption in its facilities. Reduced energy use results in cost savings for public <b>housing</b> <b>authorities</b> (PHAs) and the federal government, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides utility subsidies to PHAs and oversees their work. Working with HUD, many <b>housing</b> <b>authorities</b> have used energy performance contracts to perform energy efficiency retrofits. These contracts {{will continue to be}} an important tool to enable <b>housing</b> <b>authorities</b> to invest in energy efficiency. As a leading environmental nonprofit, Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) has a significant role to play in helping PHAs across the country to invest in energy efficiency. Some <b>housing</b> <b>authorities</b> have already performed energy efficiency retrofits; many others have not yet become involved in programs to reduce energy use. EDF can work with <b>housing</b> <b>authorities</b> of varying levels of experience to help increase investment in energy efficiency nationwide. If EDF is successful in its strategy, it should expect to see <b>housing</b> <b>authorities</b> of all sizes using locally- or context-appropriate funding models to invest in energy efficiency. Working with public <b>housing</b> <b>authorities,</b> HUD, and partner organizations, EDF has the ability to help decrease our nation’s energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy use. These efforts can increase national awareness of the importance of making the country’s affordable housing stock more energy efficient. Implementing the strategy outlined here will help EDF improve the climate, preserve affordable housing for those who need it most, and demonstrate the significance of public housing...|$|R

5|$|After Janet passed Barbados, {{the island}} was {{declared}} a state of emergency. Relief workers on Barbados helped to clean up debris scattered by the strong winds on highways, and the local government made requests for food and construction materials. The extensive damaged caused by Janet on the island to low-income households led the passage of the 1955Housing Act, which created the National <b>Housing</b> <b>Authority</b> (NHA) in 1956. The NHA was responsible for the acquisition of lands on which houses could be built with stronger and more permanent materials, which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane-related damage. The newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struck.|$|E

The Uptown site west of the Wilson Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) station was opposed by those concerned for the displacement of low income residents, largely blacks, southern whites and American Indians. The project was mired in heated controversy for decades. Avery v Pierce, a federal lawsuit filed in 1975, alleged that the razing of about 3,000 low-income housing units {{for the development of}} Harry S Truman College constituted misspending of funds by the City and Chicago <b>Housing</b> <b>Authority.</b> Plaintiffs were represented by Shiller's former campaign manager, attorney James P.

By January 1946, these figures had fallen to 43,000 and 48,000 respectively. By the time the Manhattan Project concluded {{at the end of}} 1946, the corresponding figures were 34,000 and 43,000. The departure of large numbers of construction workers meant that 47 percent of those remaining were family members of workers. Eight dormitories were closed in October 1945. Most of those who remained in dorms now had their own rooms. The white hutments began to be removed. Trailers were returned to the Federal Public <b>Housing</b> <b>Authority.</b>|$|E

He oversaw a vast increase in the Commission's production capabilities before retiring again in 1951. From 1960 to 1964, he worked on the preparations for the 1964 New York World's Fair.|$|E
50|$|In 1938 Prime Minister Mackenzie King {{implemented}} the National Housing Act {{as a replacement}} to the Dominion Housing Act. The NHA authorized {{the federal government to}} make loans to limited dividend and local <b>housing</b> <b>authorities,</b> which could amount to a maximum of 80 and 90% of their construction costs, respectively. In exchange for this funding, local <b>housing</b> <b>authorities</b> had to fix rents so that they did not exceed 20% of the occupants' aggregate income; however, the NHA also stipulated that landlords could not incur a deficit through a rental agreement. The NHA enabled the government to make joint loans with approved lending institutions, so long as those loans equated to 70-80% of the construction costs of the project. Loan agreements stipulated the portion of debt that each party would incur if the borrower defaulted on his or her loan. A 1944 amendment revoked the right of the Minister of Finance to grant loans to local <b>housing</b> <b>authorities.</b> Clark, who was responsible for drafting the NHA, felt that the competition posed by public <b>housing</b> <b>authorities</b> deterred private investment.|$|R
