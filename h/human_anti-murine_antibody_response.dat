40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>anti-murine</b> <b>antibody</b> (HAMA) <b>response</b> is {{a serious}} problem in the {{repeated}} infusion of murine monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). HAMA positive sera were obtained from seven patients with colorectal cancer, pancreas cancer, malignant melanoma or myocardial infarction who had previously received radiolabelled MoAbs. The nature of HAMA was analysed using size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after incubating with radiolabelled MoAbs including IgG, Fab or human/mouse chimeric Abs. Immune complexes composed of HAMA and MoAbs were formed. The percentage of radioactivity with a high molecular weight was related to HAMA levels determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Most radioactivity present in immune complex shifted to the antibody fraction after the addition of normal murine serum. All of seven sera were reactive with all four murine IgGs and this suggests that HAMA in these patients recognised the constant region of MoAbs. In one patient, HAMA was considered to recognise the variable region and to be anti-idiotypic. There was no significant binding with human/mouse chimeric Abs in any HAMA positive serum, although five out of seven patients were reactive with murine MoAb Fab, indicating that HAMA was composed of Abs responsive to the CH 1 or CL region of murine IgG. These results suggest that (1) HAMA was composed of Ab responsive to Fc portion and/or CH 1 or CL region of murine IgG, and (2) human/mouse chimeric Abs look promising in the repeated infusion of MoAb in HAMA positive patients...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, many neuroblastoma patients at MSKCC {{were treated with}} a murine (mouse-derived) monoclonal antibody called 3F8. Given intravenously, 3F8 binds specifically to neuroblastoma cells and triggers an immune response, which destroys the cancerous cells. Because the antibody also binds to peripheral nerve cells, the treatment is painful, but it is generally without long-term complications. However, its use {{is limited by the}} body's eventual development of <b>human</b> <b>anti-murine</b> <b>antibody,</b> which neutralizes the effects. The Band of Parents raised $2-$3 million to fund the genetic engineering of the murine cell line that produces 3F8 so that it would produce a new antibody, Hu3F8, using human genes. Hu3F8 has the same benefits as 3F8, but because it is 98% human, it does not cause a neutralizing immune response. In theory, this should allow patients to be treated with it indefinitely.|$|R
40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{a common}} cancer affecting majority of the Chinese. Due {{to the problem of}} non-specificity, common methods of cancer treatment including systemic chemotherapy, affects not only cancer cells but also normal tissues. In order to develop a specific treatment for HCC, a murine anti-human HCC monoclonal antibody was raised in 1991. However, murine monoclonal antibodies will cause HAMA (<b>Human</b> <b>Anti-Murine</b> <b>Antibody)</b> reaction when injected into human body, hence they are not ideal for use in human cancer therapy. One way to prevent the HAMA reaction is to "umanize" the murine monoclonal antibody before clinical application. The aim of humanization is to reduce the murine monoclonal antibody's immunogenicity while maintaining its binding activity. Human consensus sequence was used as a template to design the amino acid sequence of the humanized antibody variable region, and synthetic DNA molecules for protein expression were produced through overlapping PCR from single strand oligonucleotides. The synthetic DNA molecules and human antibody constant region cDNA were used to construct two human cytomegalovirus promotor-based expression vectors for both antibody light chain and heavy chain. Completely assembled humanized antibody was expressed in mammalian cells and purified using protein A. The humanized antibody has been found to have binding activity to a human liver cancer cell-line (SMMC- 7721) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{anti-human}} {{hepatocellular carcinoma}} (HCC) monoclonal antibody, hHP- 1, was genetically humanized from a murine monoclonal antibody. In this study, {{a concept of}} positional template approach was applied to design the amino acid sequence of hHP- 1 's variable region, and synthetic DNA fragments for protein expression were produced through overlapping PCR from single strand oligonucleotides. Synthetic DNA fragments and human antibody constant region cDNA were used to construct two CMV promotor-based expression vectors for the antibody light and heavy chains, in which the variable region was connected directly to the constant region without an intron sequence. Completely assembled humanized antibody was successfully expressed in mammalian cells as IgG 1 kappa molecules and purified using protein A affinity column. The immunogenicity of the hHP 1 was estimated by the amino acid sequence and determined through a HAMA (<b>human</b> <b>anti-murine</b> <b>antibody)</b> serum reaction assay. Results indicated that the immunogenicity of hHP- 1 was significantly reduced, lit vitro binding activity assay showed that the hHP- 1 had retained its binding function to a human HCC SMMC- 7721 cell-line, without cross binding to other human normal tissues. Immunofluorescence staining showed that hHP- 1 had a strong binding activity to, SMMC cells. A competitive binding assay showed that the relative binding activity of hHP- 1 was approximately 25 % binding activity of the original murine antibody. Our results indicate that a humanized antibody could be produced using intronless vectors and expressed as a complete IgG 1 kappa antibody. Hence we believe that hHP- 1 could be a potential candidate for HCC treatment, (C) 2001 Academic Press...|$|R
40|$|High-affinity {{interleukin}} 2 receptors (IL- 2 Rs) {{are expressed}} by T cells activated {{in response to}} foreign histocompatibility antigens but not by normal resting T cells. To exploit this difference in IL- 2 R expression, anti-Tac-M, a murine monoclonal antibody specific for the IL- 2 R alpha chain, was used to inhibit organ allograft rejection. However, the use of murine anti-Tac as an immunosuppressive agent was limited by neutralization by <b>human</b> <b>anti-murine</b> <b>antibodies</b> and by weak recruitment of effector functions. To circumvent these difficulties, a humanized antibody to the IL- 2 R, anti-Tac-H, was prepared. This molecule is human {{with the exception of}} the hypervariable segments, which are retained from the mouse. In vivo survival of anti-Tac-H is 2. 5 -fold longer than simultaneously administered anti-Tac-M (terminal t 1 / 2, 103 hr vs. 38 hr). In addition, anti-Tac-H is less immunogenic than anti-Tac-M when administered to cynomolgus monkeys undergoing heterotopic cardiac allografting. Specifically, all monkeys treated with anti-Tac-M developed measurable anti-anti-Tac-M levels by day 15 (mean onset, 11 days). In contrast, none of the animals receiving anti-Tac-H produced measurable antibodies to this monoclonal antibody before day 33. Finally, there was a prolongation of graft survival in the cynomolgus heterotopic cardiac allograft model in animals receiving anti-Tac. In animals that received anti-Tac-M, the allograft survival was prolonged compared to that of the control group (mean survival, 14 +/- 1. 98 days compared to 9. 2 +/- 0. 48 days; P less than 0. 025). Graft survival was further prolonged by anti-Tac-H with a mean survival of 20. 0 +/- 0. 55 days (compared to controls, P less than 0. 001; compared to anti-Tac-M, P less than 0. 02). There was no toxicity attributable to the administration of either form of anti-Tac. Thus, anti-Tac-H significantly prolonged allograft survival in primates, without toxic side effects, and may be of value as an adjunct to standard immunosuppressive therapy in humans...|$|R
40|$|The bispecific OC/TR {{monoclonal}} antibody (mAb) cross-links the CD 3 molecule on T cells {{with the human}} folate-binding protein (FBP), which is highly expressed on nonmucinous ovarian carcinomas. Clinical trials of patients with ovarian carcinoma with the OC/TR mAb have shown some complete and partial responses. Most patients developed <b>human</b> <b>anti-murine</b> immunoglobulin <b>antibodies</b> (HAMA), which can inhibit OC/TR mAb-mediated lysis. We generated a chimeric version of the OC/TR mAb to decrease the immunogenicity of the OC/TR mAb and to allow more extended treatment schedules. Sp 2 / 0 myeloma cells were transfected with chimeric heavy- and light-chain genes encoding the anti-CD 3 mAb and the MOv 18 mAb, respectively, which are reactive with FBP. The resulting cell line produced 80 micrograms/ml of total immunoglobulin G (IgG), of which 11. 5 % was the functionally active chimeric OC/TR mAb. Chimeric OC/TR F(ab') 2 fragments mediated lysis of IGROV- 1 ovarian carcinoma cells by human T cells at antibody concentrations of > or = 1 pg/ml. Specific lysis was still detectable at an effector-to-target cell ratio as low as 0. 4. Two patients with ovarian carcinoma treated with F(ab') 2 fragments of the murine OC/TR developed distinct HAMA titers, which were mainly anti-idiotypic and only partly directed against the murine antibody constant regions. However, of the two patients that were treated with the F(ab') 2 fragments of the chimeric OC/TR mAb, only one developed a low transient HAMA response just above background level. In conclusion, the generation of chimeric OC/TR may allow more extended clinical studies of bispecific mAb-mediated immunotherapy of ovarian carcinom...|$|R

A reinfection with 5 X 10 (3) organisms did not affect either primary anti-sheep erythrocyte <b>antibody</b> <b>responses,</b> or anti-dinitrophenol <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to dinitrophenylated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. With an increase of the reinfection dose to 2. 5 X 10 (4) organisms, suppression of anti-sheep erythrocyte <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> was induced.

Chapter Two found that a brisk walk prior to vaccination did not improve <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to pneumococcal or influenza vaccinations in young (18 - 30 yrs) or older (50 - 64 yrs) adults. Chapter Three examined whether a lifestyle physical activity intervention affected <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to pneumococcal vaccination in sedentary middle-aged women. There was no effect on <b>antibody</b> <b>response,</b> body composition or fitness measures, although there was an improvement in {{quality of life for}} the intervention group. Finally, Chapter Four investigated the relationship between psychosocial and physical activity status and <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to vaccination in HIV+ patients. <b>Antibody</b> <b>response</b> to some strains of the pneumococcal vaccine were predicted by higher physical activity levels (pn 1, pn 6 b, pn 18 c), greater social support (pn 3) and lower life events stress (pn 1). However, the majority of analyses found that <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to vaccination was not affected by these measures.

The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of a probiotic product containing the above bacteria in addition to Streptococcus faecalis on the induction of the chicken <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to various antigens, both systemically and in the gut. The birds received probiotics via oral gavage and subsequently were immunized with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) to evaluate <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> in serum or with tetanus toxoid (TT) to measure the mucosal <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> in gut contents. Control groups received phosphate-buffered saline. Overall, BSA and SRBC induced a detectable <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> as early as week 1 postimmunization (p. i.), which lasted until week 3 p. i. Probiotic-treated birds had significantly (P ≤ 0. 001) more serum antibody (predominantly immunoglobulin M [IgM]) to SRBC than the birds that were not treated with probiotics. However, treatment with probiotics did not enhance the serum IgM and IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to BSA. Immunization with TT resulted in the presence of specific IgA and IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> in the gut. Again, treatment with probiotics did not change the level or duration of the <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> in the gut.

First, {{to investigate the}} overall <b>antibody</b> <b>response,</b> overlapping linear peptides were used to screen sera taken from HIV- 1 -infected individuals. The polyclonal <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> was relatively stable during long-term infection, compared with acute infection, and mostly directed against immunodominant regions.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 In Africa, {{helminth}} and HIV {{infection is}} highly prevalent, making co-infection with helminths and HIV likely common. Both infections impact the host immune response through immune suppression and dysregulation, which {{also may have}} implications for vaccine efficacy and efforts to decrease vaccine preventable deaths. We sought to determine the impact of helminth infection on humoral immune responses to HIV and to previously administered measles and tetanus vaccines. We developed a method to evaluate HIV-specific <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> using protein microarray and principal components analysis, and identified distinct patterns of HIV-specific <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> that correlate with concurrent viral load and subsequent change in CD 4 count. Within two randomized trials examining the effect of deworming on HIV disease progression, we conducted nested serologic studies to {{examine the impact of}} helminth infection (n= 100) and deworming (n= 35) on specific <b>antibody</b> <b>responses.</b> The prevalence of HIV specific <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> was similar between individuals with any helminth infection compared to helminth uninfected individuals.

40|$|Passively {{transferred}} thymocytes and spleen {{cells from}} donors primed with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) exerted differential suppressive effect on IgM and IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> of syngeneic recipients immunized with DNP-KLH depending {{primarily on the}} time when KLH-primed cells were transferred. This was demonstrated by the decrease {{in the numbers of}} DNP-specific direct and indirect PFC in the spleen of the recipients given KLH-primed cells at different times during primary and secondary immunization. Whereas the cell transfer simultaneously with or 2 days after the primary immunization produced only slight suppression of the peak IgM <b>antibody</b> <b>response,</b> it caused profound suppression of late IgM and IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>responses.</b> By contrast, the cell transfer 3 days after the immunization produced immediate suppression of the ongoing IgM <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> resulting in its earlier termination, while being unable to prevent the induction of IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>response.</b> KLH-primed cells could moderately suppress the secondary anti-DNP <b>antibody</b> <b>response,</b> in which IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> was found to be slightly more sensitive than IgM <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to the suppressive influence of KLH-primed cells. The suppressive effect of the KLH-primed spleen cells was completely eliminated by the in vitro treatment of the cells with anti-θ and C before cell transfer, indicating that cells responsible for the suppression are, in fact, T cells. The suppression of DNP-specific <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> by KLH-primed T cells was achieved only if the recipients were immunized with DNP-KLH but not with DNP-heterologous carrier, suggesting that direct interaction between T and B cells is necessary for the suppression of the <b>antibody</b> <b>response.</b> It is concluded that susceptibility of B cells to the specific suppressive influence of T cells is inherently different depending on the differentiation stage of B cells and on the immunoglobulin class they are destined to produce...|$|R

Results: Increasing IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> specific for A. fumigatus antigens closely paralleled cytologic or microbiological identification of A. fumigatus from bronchoalveolar ravage fluid and decrease of lung function. Increasing specific IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> were found to precede radiographic identification of lung cavitation by 1 to 2 weeks, precede the diagnosis of aspergillosis by 2 to 20 weeks, and detect fungal reinfection. In most cases, successful antifungal treatment decreased specific IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>response.</b> A decrease in specific IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> correlated with the inability to culture or identify A. fumigatus in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and with radiographic and clinical improvement.

The <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> {{of cattle}} to the minor 89 -kDa outer-membrane protein (OMP) of brucella was {{measured}} by indirect ELISA with the purified protein and compared with the <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to smooth lipopolysaccharide (S-LPS). Pre-incubating sera with sonicated cell extracts of Escherichia coli prevented the binding of antibodies from uninfected animals to the 89 -kDa OMP, suggesting the presence {{of one or more}} cross-reactive epitopes on this protein. In cattle infected experimentally with Brucella abortus, the <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to the 89 -kDa OMP was later and less intense than that to S-LPS. In naturally infected cattle, 68 % of animals showing an <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to S-LPS also showed an <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to the 89 -kDa OMP. Results indicate that specific epitopes of the 89 -kDa OMP in combination with those of other OMPs could be useful for diagnosis of brucellosis in cattle...|$|R
40|$|RIIIS/J mice lack an {{autosomal}} dominant gene(s) that influences {{the magnitude of}} the <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to several polysaccharide antigens of bacterial origin. Low responsiveness is demonstrable whether polysaccharide is administered as a T-helper-cell-independent or -dependent antigen conjugated to an immunogenic carrier; however, RIIIS/J mice make good anti-hapten <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to haptenated polysaccharides. The low <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> of RIIIS/J mice to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide {{do not appear to be}} the results of an imbalance in the activity of regulatory T lymphocytes. Compared with other strains of mice, RIIIS/J mice elicit low <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). They do not develop a cyclic primary or secondary <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> to Escherichia coli O 113 LPS; the latter is not due to a lack of mitogenic response to E. coli O 113 LPS. They also produce auto-anti-idiotypic antibody after being immunized with trinitrophenyl-Ficoll...|$|R
40|$|Animals {{deficient}} in complement components C 1 q, C 4, C 3, and CR 1 / 2 have severely impaired <b>antibody</b> <b>responses.</b> C 1 q is primarily activated by antibody-antigen complexes. Antigen-specific IgM in complex with an antigen {{is able to}} enhance the <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> against that antigen. This {{is dependent on the}} ability of IgM to activate complement. Naïve mice have very low amounts of specific antibodies and therefore it is surprising that classical pathway activation plays a role for primary <b>antibody</b> <b>responses.</b> It was hypothesized that natural IgM, present in naïve mice, would bind an antigen with enough affinity to activate C 1 q. To test this, a knock-in mouse strain, Cm 13, with a point mutation in m heavy chain, making its IgM unable to activate complement was constructed. Surprisingly, the <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> in Cm 13 were normal. Puzzled by the finding that the ability of IgM to activate complement was required only for some effects, the immunization protocol was changed to mimic an infectious scenario. With this regime, Cm 13 mice had an impaired <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> compared to wildtype (WT) mice. The <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> in WT mice to these repeated low-dose immunizations was also enhanced. These observations suggest that IgM-mediated enhancement indeed plays a physiological role in initiation of early <b>antibody</b> <b>responses.</b> IgM-mediated enhancement cannot however compensate for the dependecy of T-cell help. Although IgM from WT mice enhanced the <b>antibody</b> <b>response,</b> the T-cell response was not enhanced. The connection between classical pathway activation and CR 1 / 2 is thought to be generation of ligands for CR 1 / 2. In mice, CR 1 / 2 are expressed on B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDC). Although CR 1 / 2 are crucial for a normal <b>antibody</b> <b>response,</b> the molecular mechanism(s) are not understood. To investigate whether CR 1 / 2 must be expressed on B-cells or FDC to generate a normal <b>antibody</b> <b>response,</b> chimeric mice between WT and CR 1 / 2 -deficient mice were constructed. The results show that CR 1 / 2 + FDC were crucial for the generation of <b>antibody</b> <b>responses.</b> In the presence of CR 1 / 2 + FDC, both CR 1 / 2 + and CR 1 / 2 - B cells were equally good antibody producers. However, for an optimally enhanced <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> against IgM-antigen complexes, both B cells and FDC needed to express CR 1 / 2...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to {{sand fly}} saliva have been {{suggested}} to be a useful marker of exposure to sand fly bites and Leishmania infection and a potential tool to monitor the effectiveness of entomological interventions. Exposure to sand fly bites before infection has also been suggested to modulate {{the severity of the}} infection. Here, we test these hypotheses by quantifying the anti-saliva IgG response in a cohort study of dogs exposed to natural infection with Leishmania infantum in Brazil. Methods: IgG responses to crude salivary antigens of the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis were measured by ELISA in longitudinal serum samples from 47 previously unexposed sentinel dogs and 11 initially uninfected resident dogs for up to 2 years. <b>Antibody</b> <b>responses</b> were compared to the intensity of transmission, assessed by variation in the incidence of infection between seasons and between dogs. <b>Antibody</b> <b>responses</b> before patent infection were then compared with the severity of infection, assessed using tissue parasite loads and clinical symptoms. Results: Previously unexposed dogs acquired anti-saliva <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> within 2 months, and the rate of acquisition increased with the intensity of seasonal transmission. Over the following 2 years, <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> varied with seasonal transmission and sand fly numbers, declining rapidly in periods of low transmission. <b>Antibody</b> <b>responses</b> varied greatly between dogs and correlated with the intensity of transmission experienced by individual dogs, measured by the number of days in the field before patent infection. After infection, anti-saliva <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> were positively correlated with anti-parasite <b>antibody</b> <b>responses.</b> However, {{there was no evidence that}} the degree of exposure to sand fly bites before infection affected the severity of the infection. Conclusions: Anti-saliva <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> are a marker of current transmission intensity in dogs exposed to natural infection with Leishmania infantum, but are not associated with the outcome of infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} both H- 2 and non-H- 2 genes on <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to two Chlamydia trachomatis heat shock {{proteins}} (hsp 60 and hsp 70) were investigated. These chlamydial proteins are homologs of Escherichia coli GroEL (hsp 60) and DnaK (hsp 70) and are highly sequence conserved between bacterial and mammalian sources. <b>Antibody</b> <b>responses</b> among 17 different strains of mice immunized with C. trachomatis serovar B and serovar C elementary bodies {{were evaluated by}} immunoblot, radioimmunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. <b>Antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to the two proteins displayed host genetic restriction. Of six distinctive H- 2 haplotypes, only H- 2 d generated high <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to hsp 70. Five of the six H- 2 haplotypes, i. e., H- 2 a, H- 2 d, H- 2 k, H- 2 q, and H- 2 s, produced high <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to hsp 60. Only the H- 2 b-bearing strain had low <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to hsp 60. By using congenic and H- 2 recombinant strains, the genes responsible for regulating <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to hsp 70 and hsp 60 were mapped to the K-IA region of the H- 2 locus. In F 1 hybrid crosses {{between high and low}} responders, high responses to hsp 60 and hsp 70 were dominant traits. Other genes outside the H- 2 locus also influenced <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to hsp 60 and hsp 70, since inbred strains of identical H- 2 but different background genes displayed variable <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to the proteins. The genetic control of murine immune responses to C. trachomatis hsp 60, a putative chlamydial immunopathologic antigen, suggests that a similar genetic mechanism may also exist in humans, and this observation may help to explain the observed variability in the spectrum of chlamydial diseases seen in humans...|$|R

Exposure to P. jirovecii can be assessed by serum <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to recombinant antigens from the major surface glycoprotein (MsgC), although factors that influence {{the magnitude of the}} <b>antibody</b> <b>response</b> are incompletely understood. We determined the magnitudes of <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to P. jirovecii in comparison to adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in HIV-infected and uninfected patients and identified predictors associated with the magnitude of the response. We performed a cross-sectional analysis using serum samples and data from 153 HIV-positive and 92 HIV-negative subjects enrolled in a feasibility study of the Veterans Aging Cohort 5 Site Study (VACS 5). Antibodies were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Independent predictors of <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> were determined using multivariate Tobit regression models. The results showed that serum <b>antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to P. jirovecii MsgC fragments were significantly and independently decreased in current smokers. Antibodies to P. jirovecii also tended to be lower with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hazardous alcohol use, injection drug use, and HIV infection, although these results were not statistically significant. These results were specific to P. jirovecii and did not correlate with adenovirus. <b>Antibody</b> <b>responses</b> to RSV were in the inverse direction. Thus, current smoking was independently associated with decreased P. jirovecii <b>antibody</b> <b>responses.</b> Whether smoking exerts an immunosuppressive effect that affects the P. jirovecii <b>antibody</b> <b>response,</b> colonization, or subsequent risk for disease is unclear; prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate these findings further...|$|R
