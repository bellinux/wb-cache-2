The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived <b>from</b> <b>coal</b> and nuclear power plants.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for the Old Bay Line, its freight and {{passenger}} traffic remained relatively strong in the 1930s and the company embarked on a modernization program for its main boats of the line. The President Warfield and State of Maryland were converted <b>from</b> <b>coal</b> to oil burning in 1933 and had sprinkler systems installed in 1938. In 1939, the State of Virginia was converted to oil burning and all three ships were equipped with radio direction finders and ship-to-shore telephones.|$|E

5|$|Among Beshear's other {{activities}} as lieutenant governor was {{his participation in}} an investigation of Kentucky Utilities' coal-buying practices.

Beshear had clashed with the company over similar issues during his term as attorney general. The company attempted to block Beshear's participation in the investigation, but the Kentucky Public Service Commission rejected the attempt.

5|$|Germany's {{foreign policy}} {{during the war}} {{involved}} the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies such as Italy and Hungary and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France. By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary. When a country was no longer dependable, Germany assumed full control as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was an official powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little co-ordination or co-operation.

The Atomic Energy Commission accepted Teller's proposal in 1958 and it was designated Project Chariot.

5|$|David {{was born}} Elizabeth Gwynne, {{the second of}} four children, all {{daughter}}s, of Rupert Sackville Gwynne and his wife, the Hon. Stella Gwynne, daughter of the 1st Viscount Ridley.

Through the two families, David was of English, Scottish and Welsh or Irish descent and, through an ancestor on her father's side, also Dutch and Sumatran. She and her sisters grew up in Wootton Manor in Sussex, a seventeenth-century manor house with extensive modern additions by Detmar Blow. Her father, despite having a weak heart, insisted on pursuing a demanding political career, becoming Conservative MP for Eastbourne, and a junior minister in Bonar Law's government. Overwork, combined with his vigorous recreational pastimes, chiefly racing, riding, and womanising, brought about his death in 1924, aged 51.|$|E
40|$|Organic sulfur {{is removed}} <b>from</b> <b>coals</b> by {{treatment}} with aqueous base, air, and vegetable oils with minimal loss of BTU. Such results were revealed during exploratory experiments on an ICCI funded project to remove organic sulfur <b>from</b> Illinois <b>coals</b> with hydroperoxides of vegetable oils. In fact, prewashing IBC- 108 coal with dilute alkali prior to treating with linseed oil and air results in 26 % removal of sulfur. This new method {{is being investigated}} by treating coals with alkali, impregnating coals with polyunsaturated oils, converting the oils to their hydroperoxides, and heating. Since these oils are relatively inexpensive and easily applied, this project {{could lead to a}} cost effective method for removing organic sulfur <b>from</b> <b>coals.</b> During the first quarter the selection of base fro pretreatment and extraction was completed. NaOH is better than NH{sub 4 }OH for the pretreatment and Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } is better than NaOH for the oil extraction. During the second quarter the effectiveness of linseed oil and NaOH for sulfur removal <b>from</b> IBC- 108 <b>coal</b> was further tested by pretreating the coal with two base concentrations at four different times followed by treatment with linseed oil at 125 {degrees}C for three different times and finally washing with 5 % Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } and methanol. During this third quarter more experimental parameters were systematically varied in order to study the effectiveness of linseed oil and NaOH for sulfur removal <b>from</b> IBC- 108 <b>coal...</b>|$|R

5|$|Oil spills {{present a}} {{localized}} threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other diminution of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution and pose long-term threats if {{the enforcement of}} water quality standards is not upheld. Acid drainage <b>from</b> <b>coal</b> mines is a persistent water quality issue in some areas, as it eliminates otter prey. This dilemma prevents, and consequently inhibits, recolonization or growth of otter populations. Recently, long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant otter populations has been discussed. Similarly, many perceived threats to otters, such as pollution and habitat alterations, have not been rigorously evaluated. Little effort has gone into assessing the threat of disease to wild river otter populations, so it is poorly understood and documented. River otters may be victims of canine distemper, rabies, respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection. In addition, North American river otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia. They host numerous endoparasites, such as nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, the sporozoan Isopora, and acanthocephalans. Ectoparasites include ticks, sucking lice(Latagophthirus rauschi), and fleas (Oropsylla arctomys).|$|E
5|$|On 25 March 2010, an A-10 {{conducted}} {{the first flight}} of an aircraft with all engines powered by a biofuel blend.

On 28 June 2012, the A-10 became the first aircraft to fly using a new fuel blend derived from alcohol; known as ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet), the fuel is cellulosic-based that can be derived using wood, paper, grass, or any cellulose based material, and are fermented into alcohols before being hydro-processed into aviation fuel. ATJ is the third alternative fuel to be evaluated by the Air Force {{as a replacement for}} petroleum-derived JP-8 fuel.

5|$|One {{issue that}} has often raised {{concerns}} {{is the use of}} cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS. The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions <b>from</b> <b>coal</b> is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram/kWh.|$|E
