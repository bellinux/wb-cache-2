40|$|LecturePg. 3 - 8 Maintenance and {{operation}} of high pressure seal oil systems on centrifugal compressors {{has been a major}} problem faced by refinery operators. This problem is intensified when sealing gases like hydrogen and mixtures of hydrocarbons. High pressures, low vilcosity, and solubility in oil pose unique problems in sealing with conventional wet seal oil systems. A breakthrough in sealing high pressure hydrogen with a gas seal design, which incorporates a natural breakdown of pressure across two seals without external pressure or flow controls is described. The retrofit has resulted in increased safety, low maintenance, and ease of operation; thus eliminating seal oil leakage and contamination. The recycle gas compressor that was retrofitted operated on 94 percent hydrogen at a discharge pressure of 12, 896 kpa (1870 psig), a discharge temperature of 71 ?C (160 ?F) and an operating speed of 10, 250 rpm.

40|$|Technical BriefTechnical Brief 1 : This {{paper will}} discuss the {{challenges}} with contamination of gas seals. The reliability of gas seals is largely dependent on having a continuous supply of clean and <b>dry</b> <b>seal</b> gas. In dynamic mode, gas supply systems take product gas from a higher pressure level in the compressor, filter it {{and use it to}} create the ideal environment for the gas seal. This typically ensures that the gas seal is provided with effective protection against contaminated process gas. Compressor gas seals are very robust sealing devices, but need to be operated in a dry and clean environment. The leading root cause of gas seal failures is contamination. One of the most common sources of contamination is during compressor start up, slow-roll, standstill, or shutdown modes or because the conditioning skid is not sufficient. In these modes {{there is a lack of}} seal gas flow, which suggests no means to produce seal gas flow is available, such as a high pressure gas source or booster for the seal gas supply. This is where it pays to have a reliable, clean gas supply. Without seal gas flow, sufficient seal gas cannot be provided to the gas seal and results in the gas seal being contaminated. This paper will describe contamination to the gas seal by process gas, during commissioning, by particle and by liquids, which are caused by inadequate seal gas supply. Then it will focus on different methods of providing seal gas flow during transient conditions. And finally, it will discuss solutions to ensure a reliable, clean gas flow to the seal at all relevant conditions together with additional possibilities to add robustness to gas seals...|$|E
