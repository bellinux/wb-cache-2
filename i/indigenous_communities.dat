5|$|The renewed {{interest}} in residential schools in the early 1800s {{has been linked to}} the decline in military hostility faced by British settlers, particularly after the War of 1812. With the threat of invasion by American forces minimized, <b>Indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> were no longer viewed as allies but as barriers to permanent settlement. This perspective was further underscored by the transfer of affairs with <b>Indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> from military officials, familiar with and sympathetic to their customs and way of life, to civilian representatives concerned only with permanent colonial settlement.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, Marley's message also {{continues}} to reverberate among various <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities.</b> For instance, the Australian Aboriginal {{people continue to}} burn a sacred flame to honour his memory in Sydney's Victoria Park, while members of the Amerindian Hopi and Havasupai tribe revere his work. There are also many tributes to Bob Marley throughout India, including restaurants, hotels, and cultural festivals.|$|E

5|$|Following the government's {{closure of}} most of the schools in the 1960s, the work of Indigenous activists and historians led to greater {{awareness}} by the public of the damage the schools had caused, as well as to official government and church apologies, and a legal settlement. These gains were achieved through the persistent organizing and advocacy by <b>Indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> {{to draw attention to the}} residential school system's legacy of abuse, including their participation in hearings of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.|$|E
5|$|In December 1984, the Taiwan Aboriginal People's Movement was {{launched}} {{when a group}} of aboriginal political activists, aided by the progressive Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT), established the Alliance of Taiwan Aborigines (ATA, or yuan chuan hui) to highlight the problems experienced by <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> all over Taiwan, including: prostitution, economic disparity, land rights and official discrimination in the form of naming rights.|$|E

There were also events in Sydney.|$|E

5|$|Centred {{primarily}} in Western countries, {{those involved in}} the New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as modern Pagan and <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities.</b> From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Indigenous art of {{the western}} desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began {{painting}} in 1971, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across <b>Indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all {{of the founders of}} the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> did not evenly {{share in}} the {{benefits}} of the economic boom Taiwan experienced during {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century. They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of marketable skills. The economic disparity between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization has led to an increase in alcoholism and prostitution among aborigines.|$|E

Notley's provincial government called on the federal government to hold an inquiry on the missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada at the same time. They also stated their intent to build relationships with provincial leaders of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>communities,</b> and sought to amend the provincial curriculum to include the history of Indigenous culture.|$|E
5|$|Polar bears can be {{hunted for}} sport in Canada {{with a special}} permit and accompaniment by a local guide. This can be an {{important}} source of income for small communities, as guided hunts bring in more income than selling the polar bear hide on markets. The United States, Russia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada allow subsistence hunting, and Canada distributes hunting permits to <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities.</b> The selling of these permits is a main source of income for many of these communities. Their hides can be used for subsistence purposes, kept as hunting trophies, or can be bought in markets.|$|E
5|$|The {{reductions}} were self-sufficient <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> of 2,000–4,000 inhabitants, usually {{headed by}} two Jesuit priests and the cabildo (town council and cacique (tribal leader), who retained their functions {{and played the}} role of intermediaries between the native peoples and the Jesuits. However, {{the degree to which the}} Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and the degree to which they allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate, and the social organization of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the one hand, to theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being much closer to the mark.|$|E

The Project is exploring the nature of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>community</b> governance in diverse contexts and locations across Australia through a series of diverse case studies—to understand what works, what doesn’t work, and why. A comparative analysis of the project’s case studies is revealing that governance and decision-making in <b>Indigenous</b> <b>community</b> governance is shaped by multiple historical, cultural and political relationships. The report concludes with some emerging issues and implications for policy makers and for Indigenous organisations and their leaders...|$|R
5|$|The {{residential}} school system harmed Indigenous children significantly by removing {{them from their}} families, depriving them of their ancestral languages, exposing many of them to physical and sexual abuse, and forcibly enfranchising them. Disconnected from their families and culture and forced to speak English or French, students who attended the {{residential school}} system often graduated unable to fit into either their communities or Canadian society. It ultimately proved successful in disrupting the transmission of Indigenous practices and beliefs across generations. The legacy of the system {{has been linked to}} an increased prevalence of post-traumatic stress, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide, which persist within <b>Indigenous</b> <b>communities.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, {{the giant}} otter interacts with {{indigenous}} groups, who often practice traditional hunting and fishing. A study of five <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> in Colombia suggests native {{attitudes toward the}} animal are a threat: the otters are often viewed as a nuisance that interferes with fishing, and are sometimes killed. Even when told {{of the importance of}} the species to ecosystems and the danger of extinction, interviewees showed little interest in continuing to coexist with the species. Schoolchildren, however, had a more positive impression of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Unrest {{then broke}} out across eastern Bolivia, as radicalized autonomist activists {{established}} blockades, occupied airports, clashing with pro-government demonstrations, police, and armed forces. Some formed paramilitaries, bombing state companies, indigenous NGOs, {{and human rights}} organisations, also launching armed racist attacks on <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities,</b> culminating in the Pando Massacre of MAS activists. The autonomists gained support from some high-ranking politicians; Santa Cruz Governor Rubén Costas lambasted Morales and his supporters with racist epithets, accusing the president of being an Aymara fundamentalist and a totalitarian dictator responsible for state terrorism. Amid the unrest, foreign commentators began speculating {{on the possibility of}} civil war.|$|E

5|$|While the ADF {{does not}} have a {{significant}} nation-building role, it provides assistance to remote Indigenous Australian communities through the Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Program. Under this program, which has been conducted since 1996, an engineer squadron works with one community for several months each year to upgrade local infrastructure and provide training. The ADF also took part in the intervention in remote Northern Territory <b>Indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> between June 2007 and October 2008.

5|$|Assimilation efforts {{began as}} early as the 17th century with the arrival of French colonists in New France. They were {{resisted}} by <b>Indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> who were unwilling to leave their children for extended periods and who came to associate missionaries with the diseases devastating Indigenous populations. The establishment of day and boarding schools by groups including the Récollets, Jesuits and Ursulines was largely abandoned by the 1690s. The political instability and realities of colonial life also {{played a role in the}} decision to halt the education programs. An increase in orphaned and foundling colonial children limited church resources, and colonists benefited from favourable relations with Indigenous peoples in both the fur trade and military pursuits.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Indigenous art of {{the western}} desert began in 1971 when Indigenous men at Papunya created murals and canvases using western art materials, {{assisted}} by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across <b>Indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> of central Australia, particularly after {{the introduction of a}} government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and '90s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all {{of the founders of the}} Papunya Tula artists' company, were men, and there was resistance among the Pintupi men of central Australia to women also painting. However, many of the women wished to participate, and in the 1990s many of them began to paint. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale.|$|E
