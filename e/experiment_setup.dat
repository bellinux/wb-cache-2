5000|$|Beginning in 1942, Dr. Wächter of Telefunken, {{working with}} radio {{engineers}} at the Reichspost, used {{this information to}} build a passive radar system using the CH broadcasts and their own receivers. This was not unlike the Daventry <b>experiment</b> <b>setup</b> that had first been used to demonstrate the radar concept in the UK in early 1935. In both cases, broadcasts from a distant station were used as a signal, and when an aircraft flew into the signal it reflected some {{of it to the}} receiver, creating a distinct [...] "blip" [...] on the display.|$|E
50|$|The {{method is}} {{particularly}} useful for field tests of structures {{that are likely}} to be damaged by applying loads near the critical load and beyond, such as reinforced concrete columns or advanced composite materials. The method can also minimize parasitic effects in experiments and give values that are closer to the theoretically expected values. For example, in a real <b>experiment</b> <b>setup</b> it is impossible to reproduce any theoretical boundary condition perfectly. Additionally, the results of compressive tests can be very sensitive to imperfections and the actual boundary conditions. Therefore, the measured critical load during the experiment can be very different from what is predicted.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a remotely controlled educational <b>experiments</b> <b>setup</b> for Active Noise Control (ANC) and acoustic <b>experiments.</b> The <b>experiments</b> <b>setup</b> {{is based on}} the Virtual Instruments Systems in Reality (VISIR) open source platform, National Instruments LabVIEW software and a Digital Signal Processor TMS 320 C 6713 from Texas Instruments. The software development and equipment are controlled remotely form a client PC using a standard web browser. The proposed laboratory setup focuses on ANC experiments applied to noise in a ventilation duct. The laboratory setup will enable students to test and investigate properties and behaviour of adaptive algorithms in reality as compared to more confined simulations usually carried out in Matlab etc. The general steps in ANC, such as the feasibility of active control, designing, testing and debugging ANC algorithms, configuration and implementation of an active control system, are all covered. In addition students will be able to study the effect of analog to digital converters (ADC), anti-aliasing filters, digital to analog converters (DAC) and reconstruction filters using digital signal processing in reality, etc. The laboratory setup is suitable {{for a wide range of}} courses such as sound related experiments in upper secondary school physics, digital signal processing, adaptive signal processing, and acoustics at university level...|$|R

Firstly, we studied the effects of network topology size on the success rate for proposed mechanism (OR), for the unipath-based mechanism (UP), and for the multipath ticket-based (TK) mechanism.

The last surviving birth was on day 600, bringing the total population to a mere 2200 mice, even though the <b>experiment</b> <b>setup</b> allowed {{for as many as}} 3840 mice in terms of nesting space. This period between day 315 and day 600 saw a breakdown in social structure and in normal social behavior. Among the aberrations in behavior were the following: expulsion of young before weaning was complete, wounding of young, increase in homosexual behavior, inability of dominant males to maintain the defense of their territory and females, aggressive behavior of females, passivity of non-dominant males with increased attacks on each other which were not defended against.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to separate particles with different sign of acoustic contrast factors, acoustic method {{can also be}} used to separate particles with different size. Shi et al. reported a standing surface acoustic wave (SSAW) microfluidic device to separate microparticles with different diameters.(Fig. 7) According to the equation of primary acoustic radiation force, larger particles with experience larger force than smaller particles. Shi et al. used interdigital transducers (IDTs) to generate SSAW field in a microfluidic channel, and they positioned the pressured nodes in the middle of the channel. When introducing a mixture of particles with different size from the edge of the channel, larger particles will migrate faster to middle of the channel and be collected at the center outlet. Smaller particles will not be able to migrate to the center outlet before they are collected from the side outlets. This <b>experiment</b> <b>setup</b> has also been used to separate blood components, bacteria, and hydrogel particles.|$|E

40|$|As {{computing}} technology evolves, users perform {{more complex}} tasks with computers. Hence, users expect from user interfaces {{to be more}} proactive than reactive. A proactive interface should anticipate the user’s intentions and take the right action without requiring a user command. The crucial first step for such an interface is to infer the user’s mental state, which gives important cues about user intentions. This thesis consists of several case studies on inferring mental states of computer users.   Biosensing technology provides a variety of hardware tools for measuring several aspects of human physiology, which is correlated with emotions and mental processes. However, signals gathered with biosensors are notoriously noisy. The mainstream approach to overcome this noise is either to increase the signal precision by expensive and stationary sensors or to control the <b>experiment</b> <b>setups</b> more heavily. Both of these solutions undermine the usability of the developed methods in real-life user interfaces. In this thesis, machine learning is used as an alternative strategy for handling the biosignal noise in mental state inference. Computer users have been monitored under loosely controlled <b>experiment</b> <b>setups</b> by cheap and inaccurate biosensors, and novel machine learning models that infer mental states such as affective state, mental workload, relevance of a real-world object, and auditory attention are built. The methodological contributions of the thesis are mainly on multi-view learning and multitask learning. Multi-view learning is used for integrating signals of multiple biosensors and the stimuli. Multitask learning is used for inferring multiple mental states at once, and for exploiting the inter-subject similarities for higher prediction accuracy. A novel multitask learning algorithm that transfers knowledge across multi-view learning tasks is introduced. Another novelty is a Bayesian factor analyzer with a time-dependent latent space that captures the dynamic nature of biosignals better than methods that assume independent samples.  The overall outcome of the thesis {{is that it is}} feasible to predict mental states from unobtrusive biosensors with reasonable accuracy using state-of-the-art machine learning models...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an alternative {{way to test}} {{the amount of energy}} harvested by an antenna. Accurately measuring the amount of energy an antenna harvests is a challenge. The test equipment that touches the antenna can greatly affect the results of the test. Using a VCO to measure an antenna's harvested power enables accuracy and prevents the need to attach testing equipment. The VCO is powered by a harvesting antenna. The frequency produced is then output to a transmitting antenna. The output frequency of the VCO can easily be determined and then used to look up the power from the characteristics of the VCO. A background study of types of VCOs, and VCOs available on the market will also be included in this thesis. Finally the <b>experiment</b> <b>setups</b> and results will be presented...|$|R
40|$|After {{conducting}} some experiment one always {{faces the}} tedious work of manually annotating and examining it. This is time consuming and error prone, {{especially if the}} experiment contains {{a large amount of}} relevant events that need to be annotated. In this thesis we tackle this problem for a real world experiment from the field of sport psychology, where two players have to pass a ball to each other as quickly as possible by bouncing it over a target zone. The experiments evaluation consists of the number of passes that bounced on the target zone in relation to the number of bounces that did not. Our main idea was to cover the target zone with a surface different from the one outside of it and use audio classification techniques to classify the bounces. To obtain the required audio data we made minor changes to the <b>experiments</b> <b>setup</b> by adding two microphones to it and changing the surface of the target zone. We conducted a number of <b>experiments</b> with this <b>setup,</b> extracted and analyzed all bounces from the audio data we retrieved and showed, that an automatic classification is very possible and feasible...|$|R
