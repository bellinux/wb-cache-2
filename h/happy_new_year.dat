25|$|In 1995 Panahi {{made his}} feature film debut, The White Balloon (Badkonak-e sefid), {{produced}} by IRIB- Channel 2, Ferdos Films and the Farabi Cinema Foundation. Initially titled <b>Happy</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year,</b> Panahi developed the original story with Parviz Shahbazi {{and attempted to}} get funding from IRIB's Channel 1 {{with the expectation that}} it would be a short film, but his proposal was rejected. He then showed his original treatment for the film to Kiarostami during the shooting of Through the Olive Trees. Kiarostami encouraged Panahi to make the idea into a feature and agreed to write the script. During their car rides to set while shooting, Kiarostami would dictate the film's script while Panahi taped the conversation and typed the script. Kiarostami also helped Panahi secure funding from IRIB's Channel 2. While casting the film, Panahi traveled throughout Iran in order to include all of the diverse ethnicities of his country as characters in the film. He found lead actress Aida Mohammadkhani at the first school that he visited and immediately cast her as Razieh, but auditioned 2,600 young boys for the role of Razieh's brother Ali before settling on Mohsen Kalifi. He cast non-professionals in most of the supporting roles, including a real fish seller he found in the Rasht market and a college student to portray the young soldier. He also cast professional actress Anna Borkowska as an Armenian woman.|$|E
