60|$|Mr Abel {{remained}} behind, {{very often}} {{looking at his}} watch and at the room door, until Mr Swiveller was roused from a short nap, by the setting-down on the landing-place outside, as from the shoulders of a porter, of some giant load, which seemed to shake the house, and made the little physic bottles on the mantel-shelf ring again. Directly this sound reached his ears, Mr Abel started up, and hobbled to the door, and opened it; and behold! there stood a strong man, with a mighty hamper, which, being hauled into the room and presently unpacked, disgorged such treasures as tea, and coffee, and wine, and rusks, and oranges, and grapes, and fowls ready trussed for boiling, and calves'-foot jelly, and arrow-root, and sago, and other delicate restoratives, that the small servant, who had never thought it possible that such things could be, except in shops, stood rooted to the spot in her one shoe, with her mouth and eyes watering in unison, and her power of speech quite gone. But, not so Mr Abel; or the strong man who emptied the hamper, big as it was, in a twinkling; and not so the nice old lady, who appeared so suddenly that she might have come out of the hamper too (it was quite large enough), and who, bustling about on tiptoe and without noise--now here, now there, now everywhere at once--began to fill out the jelly in tea-cups, and to make chicken broth <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>saucepans,</b> and to peel oranges for the sick man and to cut them up in little pieces, and to ply the small servant with glasses of wine and choice bits of everything until more substantial meat could be prepared for her refreshment. The whole of which appearances were so unexpected and bewildering, that Mr Swiveller, when he had taken two oranges and a little jelly, and had seen the strong man walk off with the empty basket, plainly leaving all that abundance for his use and benefit, was fain to lie down and fall asleep again, from sheer inability to entertain such wonders in his mind.|$|R

5000|$|Saucepans (or just [...] "pots") are vessels with {{vertical}} sides {{about the}} same height as their diameter, used for simmering or boiling. Saucepans generally have one long handle. Larger pots of the same shape generally have two handles close {{to the sides of}} the pot (so they can be lifted with both hands), and are called sauce-pots or soup pots (3-12 litres).

60|$|At last, her eye {{rested on}} an article which stood upon the table, {{and she started}} up impetuously from her chair. She did this so suddenly, that the doctor's hand fell beside him before {{he knew that she}} had risen. The table was covered with all those {{implements}} which become so frequent about a house when severe illness is an inhabitant there. There were little boxes and apothecaries' bottles, cups and saucers standing separate, and bowls, in which messes have been prepared with the hope of suiting a sick man's failing appetite. There was a <b>small</b> <b>saucepan</b> standing on a plate, a curiously shaped glass utensil left by the doctor, and sundry pieces of flannel, which had been used in rubbing the sufferer's limbs.

50|$|Upon their arrival, both {{material}} {{and social conditions}} were difficult for the sisters. The sisters, who were active in education, faced much opposition from the Protestant teachers. In addition, they faced stark poverty. Upon the sisters' arrival at the mission house where the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart were living and where the sisters were to live, they found a kitchen equipped only with two <b>small</b> <b>saucepans,</b> a few plates, and a single spoon, to serve 12 missionaries. There were no cups or glasses, so the missionaries drank out of jam tins. They lived off of coconuts, taros, fish, black coffee, brown sugar, biscuits, boiled rice, tinned beans, and salted meat. Condensed milk and bread were treats saved for Sundays and feast days. The extreme heat, in addition to malnourishment and disease, caused a number of deaths during the early years; however, it took four months or longer for the news of this to reach Europe.|$|R

5000|$|During the Great Patriotic War the Soviet army mess kit was a two-piece design {{similar to}} that used by the Wehrmacht forces that {{consisted}} of a large main canteen part, and a <b>smaller</b> <b>saucepan</b> component that also doubled as the mess tin lid. The kit also had a wire handle which many soldiers used to hang the mess kit from their web equipment or backpack. This design was supplemented in the mid-1980s with a second design that featured a metal water bottle held in the middle. The next layer of the set was a large canteen / cooking pot with a wire handle, then a smaller saucepan-type component with a folding metal handle. This last component fitted over the base of the larger cooking pot, the handle was then folded up and clipped over the cooking pot and the lip of the water bottle. The mess set was sometimes issued with a pouch, although this was by no means certain and many soldiers simply hung it onto their equipment from the wire handle. Officers were often issued a satchel-type bag for their mess kits in keeping with their smart image. This latest design of mess kit continues to be used today in the army of the Russian Federation and doubtless [...] is still used in the armies of former Soviet republics.|$|R

The Dublin version was bequeathed by Alfred Beit in 1987. A 1933 cleaning revealed a depiction of Jesus’ supper at Emmaus on the wall behind the main figure.|$|R

40|$|Background and aim: One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in learning is ignoring the teaching <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group discussion. So, today, teaching in student-based methods such as work <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group is emphasized. Nevertheless, this method is not used for teaching physiotherapy students. This study was performed {{to determine the effect}} of teaching <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group on satisfaction and learning level of second- year students in physiotherapy in comparison with lecture teaching. Materials and methods: An experimental study was performed on 29 physiotherapy students. The students were randomly classified into two groups; lecture (14 people) and work <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group (15 people). Students were educated for 4 sessions. Two separate questionnaires were used to assess learning and satisfaction levels. Results: Overall satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group was significantly greater than lecture group (P 0. 05). 86. 7 % of students <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups preferred to be educated in the future semesters using this teaching method. Conclusion: This study showed the role of small group teaching on increasing students' satisfaction level. Due to increased satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group, despite the lack of significant difference between the two methods of learning, learning process can be facilitated. Thus this method is recommended for education of the undergraduate students...|$|R

30|$|Results {{reveal that}} in general, the {{association}} between minimum wages and firms’ actual wages, for both production workers and non-production workers, is robust and significant. For production workers, a 10 percent increase in real minimum wages {{is associated with a}} 1.8 percent increase <b>in</b> wages <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms, but only 0.8 percent increase in wages in large firms. For non-production workers, a 10 percent increase in real minimum wages is associated with a 1.65 percent increase <b>in</b> wages <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms, but only 1.2 percent in larger firms. The association between minimum wages and actual wages is significant, of large magnitude <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms, but less so in larger firms. This suggests that wages <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms are more sensitive to changes in minimum wages, which is consistent with the fact that on average, wages <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms are significantly lower. <b>In</b> other words, <b>small</b> firms are more likely to raise their wages in response to an increase in minimum wages because their wages are more binding.|$|R

Syn-dicated loans play a different role <b>in</b> large versus <b>small</b> financial systems. <b>In</b> <b>small</b> markets, loan syndications are a substitute for missing public debt markets, while in large financial markets loan syndicates enable arrangers to spread risk more efficiently. Foreign banks tend to reinforce this effect. <b>In</b> <b>small</b> markets, they transfer external finance across borders and in large markets they tend to take on more risky projects.
