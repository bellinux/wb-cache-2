We first establish blowup criteria for positive solutions. And then, for radial solutions, we obtain optimal classification for simultaneous and non-simultaneous blowup, which {{is represented by}} using the maxima of the involved variable exponents. At last, <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> of blowup <b>rates</b> are determined for both simultaneous and non-simultaneous blowup solutions...|$|R

Andrew Kliman states in his book The failure of capitalist production that [...] "I believe that there are many different legitimate ways of measuring rates of profit, and that none serves as an all-purpose measure. The most relevant rate of profit to consider always depends upon the particular question being addressed." [...] This pluralist approach provides plenty possibilities for <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> of different interpretations of <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> of profit <b>rates,</b> depending on what the question is thought to be, to which a profit rate {{is supposed to be the}} answer.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the most general form for error control coding using finite field {{multi-rate}} filters. This method shows how {{different types of}} codes can easily be generated by multi-rate filters and filter banks. In all previous works, codes and syndromes were generated using prefilters. Here we present simple multi-rate structures for encoding and generating syndrome. We show that <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> of arbitrary <b>rate</b> ###, circulant linear codes can be generated by these structures. Then we claim that a similar simple structure for syndrome generation in all presented cases exist...|$|R
40|$|Extreme helium {{stars are}} very rare low-mass supergiants in a late stage of evolution. They are {{probably}} contracting to become white dwarfs following a violent phase of evolution which {{caused them to}} become hydrogen-deficient giants, possibly R CrB stars. Using the latest generation of models for spherically expanding stellar atmospheres, {{we set out to}} measure mass-loss rates for a representative fraction of these stars. We have used high-resolution ultraviolet and optical spectra, and ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared photometry from a variety of archives. Overall atmospheric parameters have mostly been taken from previous analyses and checked for consistency. Mass-loss rates were measured by fitting the P Cygni and asymmetric profiles of C, N and Si ultraviolet resonance lines and lie in the range of 10 − 10 – 10 − 7 M yr− 1. These rates follow a Castor-type (˙M ∝ L 1. 5) relation marking a lower limit for the mass loss from hot stars of <b>all</b> <b>kinds.</b> The mass-loss <b>rates</b> of the stars studied also show a strong correlation with their proximity to the Eddington limit. There is no firm evidence for variability in the stellar wind, although photospheric pulsations have been reported in many cases...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of his {{research}} on perceptual agreement, Cees van der Eijk (2001, Quality & Quantity: 35, 325 – 341) indicates that empirical measures that resort to the standard deviation of the response distribution capture not only consensus but also skewedness. Thus they are inappropriate measures of agreement. His alternative measure of agreement, A, circumvents this problem and yields unbiased figures for <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> of ordered <b>rating</b> scales. It first decomposes the frequency distribution into constituent layers, that is, row vectors for which consensus can be unambiguously defined. It then computes the weighted average degree of agreement. Given the lack of a corresponding ado-file, the user-written agrm command allows you to directly calculate van der Eijk’s index of agreement, A, in Stata. Aside from a broad range of basic programming features such as low-level parsing and specifying additional program options, argm also entails more advanced techniques such as handling empty categories and handling numerical missing values. Moreover, it highlights the potential of nested loops and local macros in {{the context of}} multiple permutations. Finally, the agrm command is especially suited for showing how Stata’s matrix language, Mata, provides a powerful environment for handling vectors and matrices. ...|$|R

40|$|Experimentally, {{we measure}} rates of {{reactant}} consumption or rates of product formation. These rates are related to, but different from, reaction rates.
