40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a generic <b>intelligent</b> <b>sensor</b> {{software}} architecture is described which builds upon the basic requirements of related industry standards (IEEE 1451 and SEVA BS- 7986). It incorporates specific functionalities such as real-time fault detection, drift compensation, adaptation to environmental changes and autonomous reconfiguration. The modular based {{structure of the}} <b>intelligent</b> <b>sensor</b> architecture provides enhanced flexibility {{in regard to the}} choice of specific algorithmic realizations. In this context, the particular aspects of fault detection and drift estimation are discussed. A mixed indicative/corrective fault detection approach is proposed while it is demonstrated that reversible/irreversible state dependent drift can be estimated using generic algorithms such as the EKF or on-line density estimators. Finally, a parsimonious density estimator is presented and validated through simulated and real data for use in an operating regime dependent fault detection framework.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{introduce}} and demonstrate an implementation of the <b>intelligent</b> <b>sensor</b> in a 0. 8 mu BiCMOS process. The <b>intelligent</b> <b>sensor</b> is a multilayer programmable optically coupled neural network {{which can be used}} for pattern recognition for many applications. The <b>intelligent</b> <b>sensor</b> contains an 8 x 8 array of photosensitive elements as the inputs to this multilayer neural network. The design presented here marks an improvement over an existing design done in a 1. 2 mu CAMS process Performance and area efficiency are both unproved {{as a result of the}} design practices used and the benefits of the BiCMOS process used for this design. The photosensitive element offers a great performance increase over the previous design by using a true device as opposed to a parasitic device. An optical cell test chip containing several optical cell designs was fabricated and tested. The results of these tests were used to choose the optical cell used in the <b>intelligent</b> <b>sensor.</b> As well, a new training method which was tailored for this <b>intelligent</b> <b>sensor</b> design was written. This new training algorithm reduces the error of normal training methods by trying to more closely match the actual network during training. As well, a complete graphical interface was designed for this training tool. Both a 5. 0 V design and a low power 3. 3 V design of the <b>intelligent</b> <b>sensor</b> were completed and fabricated. The low power design offers a great power savings over the 5. 0 V design. The building blocks for the designs were designed and characterized using Cadence 4. 3 design tools and were simulated using Hspice. The two chips which were fabricated, were tested using several VLSI test tools and verified the simulation results achieved during the design process. Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
