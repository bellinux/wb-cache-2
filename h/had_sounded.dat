5|$|Schirra gave {{a public}} lecture at Rice University after {{returning}} to Houston, where he received a motorcade through the city. However, the Cuban Missile Crisis had been steadily escalating through September, and helped drive discussion of Schirra's successful flight down the news schedules; public concern about the relative effectiveness of Soviet and American space launchers was displaced by a more pressing concern over Soviet military rockets. He visited Washington, D.C., to receive the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President Kennedy on October 16, the same day Kennedy had first seen U-2 photographs of missile sites in Cuba; the meeting was friendly and informal despite the circumstances. Robert Kennedy, Schirra later noted, took him aside and sounded him out about a potential political career, {{the same way he}} <b>had</b> <b>sounded</b> out John Glenn a year earlier. Unlike Glenn, however, Schirra politely turned the suggestion down, and chose to remain with NASA. His later career saw him commanding the backup crew for the first Gemini mission, then the prime crew for the 1965 Gemini 6A mission, where he flew the first active rendezvous between two spacecraft - earlier plans for it to conduct the first on-orbit docking had been cancelled - and finally commanding the first Apollo mission, Apollo 7, in 1968. He retired from NASA in the summer of 1969, the only astronaut to fly on Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.|$|E

25|$|When the Civil War {{ended in}} 1865 he {{returned}} to Memphis, Tennessee, where he resumed his pre-war business affairs. In 1866 he married Hayes Dunn, with whom he would have three daughters, and shortly thereafter changed the spelling of his name to Fizer, reasoning {{that was the way}} it <b>had</b> <b>sounded</b> all his life. Three streets in Memphis were later named after him, all using this spelling. He also became a partner in a large and successful cotton brokerage firms and actively participated in local Democratic politics.|$|E

25|$|The 2016 season saw the Melbourne Storm {{return to}} the minor premiership {{position}} while the Canberra Raiders returned to the top four {{for the first time}} since the 2003. The Cronulla Sharks and reigning premiers North Queensland would fill out the top four. The season continued a trend of the minor premiership not being decided to the final round, the fourth consecutive year. The 2016 Grand Final was contested between the Melbourne Storm and the Cronulla Sharks, it was the Cronulla Sharks fourth grand final appearance while it was the seventh for the Storm. The match was a tight affair and was not settled until after the siren <b>had</b> <b>sounded.</b> The Cronulla Sharks claimed their first premiership ending a famous 49-year drought by a score of 14-12.|$|E
25|$|Baker's {{shot for}} goal missed and scored a behind, worth one point, thus tying the scores at 94 apiece. At this point, {{confusion}} reigned. The three field umpires and goal umpire conferred {{to discuss the}} result. Unaware that the siren <b>had</b> <b>sounded</b> previously, Nicholls ruled that Baker's shot had been within game time, and also that Gilmore's late bump was illegal. If no score had been registered, this would usually result in a downfield free kick; but, under the circumstances, it meant that Baker was given the option of letting the point that he'd scored stand (ensuring a draw would result) or cancelling the point and having a set shot for goal from the same place. The latter option would be a kick after the siren to win the game.|$|E

25|$|Brunk {{revealed}} in a shoot promo {{and in the}} documentary film Forever Hardcore that {{in fact it was}} not Paul Heyman that brought him into Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) but that he was at {{the right place at the}} right time. He was referred by a friend to Tod Gordon. According to the storyline, Sabu, who at that time often arrived to the ring by his handler 911, was an uncontrollable madman strapped to a gurney and with a Hannibal Lecter-style face mask while trying to break free (he claimed to hate this part of his gimmick as he was normally tired before he started his match). Sabu could only be released from his bonds to wrestle his matches. Sabu also quickly became synonymous with table-breaking at this time; if a table was not broken during the match, Sabu would break a table with his own body after the bell <b>had</b> <b>sounded,</b> sometimes leading to 911 having to restrain Sabu during backstage interviews if a table was present.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Nuristan is ethnically {{distinct from the}} rest of Afghanistan, and divided into four major groups, the Kom, Kata, Kushtoz, and Kalasha. These subgroups were in turn divided into different clans and sects of the Islamic religion, depending on lineages and the interpretations of individual religious leaders. These groups could clash violently over water rights, pasture, and religious beliefs. Five different languages and various dialects are spoken by these groups, making translators from other areas of Afghanistan useless. The Soviets had to contend with a rebel group known as the Dawlet of eastern Nuristan. They were professing a Salafi version of Islam, and hostile to any political rivals. The Nuristanis had resisted Islam as late as the year 1895 and before that had been considered a nation of infidels with a long tradition of violently resisting outsiders, their beliefs, and their invasions. Resistance in Nuristan revolved around a specific group of Islamic fighters known as Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin or HIG. During the Soviet occupation HIG received more support from the CIA than any other Mujahideen resistance group. When it came to infiltration from Pakistan, and setting up ambushes, HIG was regarded as the most skillful. In 2006 HIG was actively resisting the Afghan government. When Captain Aaron Swain of Cherokee Co. <b>had</b> <b>sounded</b> out Afghan Border Police Commander Ahmed Shah about setting up near Kamdesh, he was told that HIG insurgents tried to blow up Shah’s jeep on his last trip there and it was a bad place.|$|E
500|$|After being {{a member}} of Fridge since 1995, Kieran Hebden began {{releasing}} solo records under the name Four Tet in 1998. His first release was the [...] "Thirtysixtwentyfive" [...] single, followed by the albums Dialogue in 1999 and Pause in 2001. The albums were influenced by hip-hop, jazz and electronic music. Hebden felt his output <b>had</b> <b>sounded</b> too much like his influences and wanted to make a record that was more personal and harder to define. Hebden drew on influences from Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Jim O'Rourke, Timbaland, the Neptunes and Rodney Jerkins.|$|E

500|$|By early 1906, Scott <b>had</b> <b>sounded</b> out the RGS {{about the}} {{possible}} funding of a future Antarctic expedition. It was therefore unwelcome news to him that Ernest Shackleton had announced his own plans to travel to Discoverys old McMurdo Sound base and launch a bid for the South Pole from there. Scott claimed, {{in the first of}} a series of letters to Shackleton, that the area around McMurdo was his own [...] "field of work" [...] to which he had prior rights until he chose to give them up, and that Shackleton should therefore work from an entirely different area. In this, he was strongly supported by Discoverys former zoologist, Edward Wilson, who asserted that Scott's rights extended to the entire Ross Sea sector. This Shackleton refused to concede.|$|E
500|$|The teams {{played an}} intense {{overtime}} period filled with end-to-end rushes and brilliant saves by the goaltenders. [...] At one point, Canada's Guy Lafleur put a shot on net that snuck through the Czechoslovak goaltender, but Ivan Hlinka deliberately shoved the net {{out of place}} before the puck crossed the line. [...] He received a delay of game penalty, but prevented a Canadian win. [...] A few moments later, Guy Lapointe rifled a low shot that again beat Dzurilla, however this goal was also disallowed as the buzzer <b>had</b> <b>sounded</b> to end the first ten-minutes of the overtime period one-tenth of a second before it crossed the line. International rules of the time dictated that play was to be stopped at the ten-minute mark of each overtime period and the teams would switch {{the side of the}} ice they defended. [...] During the break, Canadian assistant coach Don Cherry noted to his team that Dzurilla often came far out of his net to defend and could be beaten on a shot from a sharp angle.|$|E

2500|$|... 18 August, {{which had}} the {{greatest}} number of casualties to both sides, has been dubbed [...] "The Hardest Day". [...] Following this grinding battle, exhaustion and the weather reduced operations for most of a week, allowing the Luftwaffe to review their performance. [...] "The Hardest Day" [...] <b>had</b> <b>sounded</b> the end for the Ju 87 in the campaign. This veteran of Blitzkrieg was too vulnerable to fighters to operate over Britain. So as to preserve the Stuka force, Göring withdrew them from the fighting. [...] This removed the main Luftwaffe precision-bombing weapon and shifted the burden of pinpoint attacks on the already-stretched Erpro 210. The Bf 110 proved too clumsy for dogfighting with single-engined fighters, and its participation was scaled back. It would only be used when range required it or when sufficient single-engined escort could not be provided for the bombers.|$|E
