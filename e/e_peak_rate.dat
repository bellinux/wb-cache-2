In order to allow an effective rate control for adaptive modulation and maximize throughput with the resulting HOM-STAR, we propose the use of power control (PC) jointly with new rate allocation schemes (RAS). At a load of 20 users per cell or sector, simulations suggest that HOM-STAR with the new RAS can deliver an average throughput per user of 120 - 140 Kb/s, i. e., an increase of about 100 % over conventional RAS. 1...|$|E

In particular, we propose a simple inverse power allocation scheme for the singular value decomposition (SVD) -based MIMO system.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{myocardial function}} {{in relation to}} high-energy phosphate (HEP) metabolism in asymptomatic patients with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes mellitus using magnetic resonance (MR) techniques. Myocardial dysfunction may occur in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus {{in the absence of}} coronary artery disease or left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. The mechanisms underlying this diabetic cardiomyopathy are largely unknown, but may involve altered myocardial energy metabolism. We assessed myocardial systolic and diastolic function and HEP metabolism in 12 asymptomatic normotensive male patients with recently diagnosed, well-controlled type 2 diabetes and 12 controls, using MR imaging and phosphorus- 31 -nuclear MR spectroscopy (31 P-MRS) on a 1. 5 T clinical scanner; 31 P-MR spectra were quantified, and myocardial HEP metabolism was expressed as phosphocreatine to adenosine-triphosphate (PCr/ATP) ratio. No differences were found in LV mass and systolic function between patients and controls. However, early (<b>E)</b> acceleration <b>peak,</b> deceleration <b>peak,</b> <b>peak</b> filling <b>rate,</b> and transmitral early-to-late diastolic peak flow (E/A) ratio, all indexes of diastolic function, were significantly decreased in patients compared with controls (p < 0. 02).

A considerable longitudinal asymmetry was found. Peak pressure was highest in the PES, lower in the inferior constrictor area, and lowest {{at the level of}} the tongue base.

In addition, the effects of an acute reduction of RV afterload by the oral intake of sildenafil were studied. Finally, we assessed whether diastolic function is related to cardiac parameters of disease severity. Methods and results: Twenty-five PH patients and 11 control subjects were studied.

Among eight hospitalized patients, four presented with a haemoconcentration and/or electrolytic disturbances. OHSS cases were compared with two control groups for a series of criteria: age, aetiology of infertility, total dose of human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG), day of oocyte collection, oestradiol (<b>E</b> 2) <b>peak</b> level, <b>rate</b> of <b>E</b> 2 increase, number of oocytes, number of embryos transferred and embryonic vitality scores. Comparison with a random group of normal IVF trials showed a significant difference for the following parameters: <b>E</b> 2 <b>peak</b> level and <b>rate</b> of increase, E 2 /dose of HMG, E 2 /day of egg collection and number of oocytes. When OHSS cases were compared to another control group consisting only of high <b>E</b> 2 responders (<b>peak</b> <b>E</b> 2 > 2700 pg/ml), no significant difference was found for any of the above-mentioned criteria. In view of this lack of predictive power of individual criteria, stepwise discriminant analysis was applied, showing that this method might provide a predictive mathematical function for evaluating the risk of OHSS before human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) administration. Such a formula, however, should be validated by a multicentric study in which a greater number of OHSS cases would be tested. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{numerous}} publications {{have identified}} {{a high number of}} traffic sources to be of self-similar nature.

This algorithm even exploits correlated traffic. Extensive simulation results illustrate the performance of the algorithm over a large parameter spectrum (Hurst parameter, load, and intensity), and the results consistently show that the higher the Hurst parameter, the higher the statistical gain. 1 Introduction In an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network [Uni 94, Uni 93, Atm 93] a user can specify additional traffic parameters, <b>e.</b> g. <b>peak</b> cell <b>rate</b> and sustainable cell rate, that describe the behavior of the traffic generation pattern in more detail.

40|$|Abstract. The flow characteristicscan be sensitively {{changed by}} the {{respiration}} flow rate due to the complex geometries, e. g., bends, constrictions in a human airway. Also, caused by the switching the flow direction, the disturbance destabilizes the flow when a human breathes. Thus, the real breathing conditions, <b>e.</b> g., <b>peak</b> flow <b>rate</b> and the breath cycle time related to workload, should be considered to investigate on the flow characteristics in a human airway. In this study, realated to the human workloads, {{the effect of the}} change of the respiratory flow rate on the flow characteristics is investigated with the numerical method at the 4 -specific normalized times in a breath cycle. In almost time of a breath cycle, as the workload increases, the flow recirculation zone decreases slightly because the energy transport toward the wall increases due to the turbulence fluctuation and the secondary motion. However, when the flow acclecrates in the expiratory phase, the flow recirculation zone increases because of the unsteady effect and the glottal jet. Thus, respiratory flow rate considering the human workloads and the unsteady effect caused by the real respiration should be considered to investigate the flow characteristics and the particle movement in a human airway...|$|R

40|$|Recent human psychophysical studies {{report that}} {{amblyopia}} {{is linked to}} robust binocular suppression during early infancy. Previously we have shown that V 1 physiology of strabimsic monkeys is dominated by interocular suppression (i. e., binocular responses are weaker than monocular responses) that immediately begins {{with the onset of}} strabismus. In this study we determined whether the prevalence of interocular suppression in V 1 and V 2 neurons of strabismic monkeys with a range of amblyopia is related to behaviorally determined degree of amblyopia in individual monkeys. Infant monkeys were reared with surgical strabismus (esotropia) between 3 weeks and 18 months of age. Since in some monkeys with surgical strabismus, visual axes may return to normal positions sometime after strabismus onset, eye alignment was monitored during early development (first 8 - 10 months). Between 18 and 24 months of age, our standard operant methods were used to obtain the spatial contrast sensitivity function for the deviating and fellow eye in each monkey from which the severity of amblyopia was determined by calculating amblyopia index for the monkey. Binocular responses of V 1 and V 2 neurons were analyzed using our standard microelectrode recording and analysis methods in anesthetized monkeys. High contrast sinusoidal gratings were dichoptically presented and the relative spatial phase was varied between the two eyes. We compared the <b>peak</b> firing <b>rate</b> of each unit under dichopitc stimulation to dominant monocular response rate. We found that our strabismic monkeys (n= 9) exhibited a wide range of amblyopia (i. e., amblyopia index ranged between 0. 3 and 0. 9). Longer duration of misalignment generally resulted in a larger amblyopia index value. Binocular interactions in V 1 and V 2 were dominated by interocular suppression and the prevalence of suppressive units (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>peak</b> binocular/monocular <b>rate</b> 3 ̆c 0 db) in individual monkeys varied with their amblyopia index values. The proportion of binocular suppressive units in V 1 and V 2 of each monkey was highly correlated with its amblyopia index; i. e., the greater the degree of amblyopia, the higher the prevalence of binocularly suppressive neurons in V 1 and V 2. Although our findings appear to be consistent with the results of psychophysical studies in humans, the exact nature of this relationship is yet to be determined...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the added value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy imaging (MPI) in consecutive patients with suspected {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) and a recent, normal exercise electrocardiography (ECG). METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients referred for MPI during a 2 -year period from 2006 - 2007 at one clinic. All eligible patients were suspected of suffering from CAD, and had performed a satisfactory bicycle exercise test (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>peak</b> heart <b>rate</b> > 85 % of the expected, age-predicted maximum) within 6 mo of referral, their exercise ECG was had no signs of ischemia, there was no exercise-limiting angina, and no cardiac events occurred between the exercise test and referral. The patients subsequently underwent a standard 2 -d, stress-rest exercise MPI. Ischemia was defined based on visual scoring supported by quantitative segmental analysis (i. e., sum of stress score > 3). The results of cardiac catheterization were analyzed, and clinical follow up was performed by review of electronic medical files. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Most patients had a low or intermediate ATPIII pre-test risk of CAD (6 patients had a high pre-test risk). The referral exercise test showed a mean Duke score of 5 (range: 2 to 11), which translated to a low post-exercise risk in 66 % and intermediate risk in 34 %. A total of seven patients were reported with ischemia by MPI. Three of these patients had high ATPIII pre-test risk scores. Six of these seven patients underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed significant stenosis in one patient with a high pre-test risk of CAD, and indeterminate lesions in three patients (two of whom had high pre-test risk scores). With MPI as a gate keeper for catheterization, no significant, epicardial stenosis was observed {{in any of the}} 50 patients (0 %, 95 % confidence interval 0. 0 to 7. 1) with low to intermediate pre-test risk of CAD and a negative exercise test. No cardiac events occurred in any patients within a median follow up period of > 1200 d. CONCLUSION: The added diagnostic value of MPI in patients with low or intermediate risk of CAD and a recent, normal exercise test is marginal...|$|R

Fruit flies are predominantly crepuscular with activity bouts in the morning (M) and evening (<b>E).</b> The M <b>peak</b> follows dawn and the <b>E</b> <b>peak</b> follows dusk when the photoperiod is extended. We show that this ability is restricted to a certain extension of the phase angle between M and <b>E</b> <b>peaks,</b> such that the <b>E</b> <b>peak</b> does not delay beyond a certain phase under long days. We demonstrate that this ability is significantly improved by simulated twilight and that it depends additionally on the genetic background and the ambient temperature.

No studies have comprehensively focused on the rate of torque development of the lower limb muscles among elderly fallers. Then, the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between muscle <b>peak</b> torque and <b>rate</b> of torque development of the lower limb joints in elderly with and without fall history It was also aimed to determine whether these parameters of muscle performance (i <b>e,</b> <b>peak</b> torque and <b>rate</b> of torque development) are related to the number of falls. Methods: Thirty-one women volunteered to participate in the study and were assigned in one of the groups according to the number of falls over the 12 months that preceded the present Then, participants with no fall history (Cl; n = 13; 67. 6 [7. 5] years-old), one fall (GII; n = 8, 66 0 [4 91 years-old) and two or more falls (GIII, n = 10; 67. 8 [8. 8] years-old) performed a number of lower limb maximal isometric voluntary contractions from which <b>peak</b> torque and <b>rate</b> of torque development were quantified Findings. Primary outcomes indicated no peak torque differences between experimental groups in any lower limb joint. The rate of torque development of the knee flexor muscles observed in the non-fallers (Cl) was greater than that observed in the fallers (P < 0. 05) and had a significant relationship with the number of falls (P < 0 05) Interpretation. The greater knee flexor muscles` rate of torque development found in the non-fallers in comparison to the fallers indicated that the ability of the elderly to rapidly reorganise the arrangement of the lower limb may play a significant role in allowing the elderly to recover balance after a trip. Thus, training stimulus aimed to improve the rate of torque development may be more beneficial to prevent falls among the elderly than other training stimulus, which are not specifically designed to improve the ability to rapidly produce large amounts of torque (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Lt...|$|R
