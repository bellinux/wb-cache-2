50|$|General Motors (GM) {{introduced}} Intake Valve Lift Control (IVLC) on {{the third}} generation Ecotec engine. The system provides two-stage variable valve lift in addition to continuous variable timing. Continuously commanded by engine control unit, the valve rocker arm switches between high-lift and low-lift profiles on the camshaft, actuated by an oil control valve through a two-feed stationary <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lash</b> <b>adjuster,</b> allowing for either 4.0 or 10.5 mm lift.|$|E
50|$|Same as the LCV but {{features}} Intake Valve Lift Control (IVLC) {{system provides}} two-stage variable valve lift {{in addition to}} continuous variable timing.

It also features a start-stop system. Maximum engine speed is listed at 7000 RPM.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} valve lifter, {{also known as}} a hydraulic tappet or a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lash</b> <b>adjuster,</b> is a device for maintaining zero valve clearance in an internal combustion engine. Conventional solid valve lifters require regular adjusting to maintain a small clearance between the valve and its rocker or cam follower. This space prevents the parts from binding as they expand with the engine's heat, but can also lead to noisy operation and increased wear as the parts rattle against one another until they reach operating temperature. The hydraulic lifter was designed to compensate for this small tolerance, allowing the valve train to operate with zero clearance—leading to quieter operation, longer engine life, and eliminating the need for periodic adjustment of valve clearance.|$|E
50|$|The 2S-E is {{the same}} as the 2S except it uses EFI. This {{particular}} engine was used in the Camry and in the Celica ST161. It was fitted with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lash</b> adjusters.|$|R

50|$|The M60 engine has double {{overhead}} camshafts {{with four}} valves per cylinder. The camshaft {{is driven by}} a dual-row timing chain with a self-adjusting tensioner.

Fuel injection and ignition are controlled by the Bosch Motronic 3.3 system, and the ignition system is a coil on plug design with knock sensors.|$|R
40|$|Un code numérique de {{simulation}} des distributions équipées de poussoirs hydrauliques a été développé. Le code est basé sur trois sous-modèles couplés : mécanique, hydraulique et physique. Le premier étudie la distribution comme un assemblage masses ressorts, le deuxième étudie le poussoir comme un organe hydraulique à part entière et le dernier permet d'étudier l'aération de l'huile et en particulier les phénomènes de dissolution. Une validation expérimentale a été menée sur un banc culasse alimenté par une huile mélangée à de l'air en proportions mesurées. L'instrumentation permettait de mesurer l'accélération de la tête de soupape, son déplacement au voisinage du siège et la force entre poussoir et soupape. Cette validation a montré que la simulation reflétait bien la réalité, notamment {{en ce qui concerne}} les effets de l'aération. A {{model of}} valvetrain {{equipped with a}} direct acting <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lash</b> <b>adjuster</b> (HLA) is presented. As it is the cause of many problems, a possible aeration is taken into account. The main model is made of three submodels: 1. The first one is a mechanical one with masses, springs and dampers and needs the cam laws and the pressure of the chamber of the HLA as data. 2. The second submodel is an hydraulic one. It studies the HLA chamber through the check valve flows, the leakage flow and the mechanical strains on the chamber oil. This submodel gives the chamber pressure to the first submodel. 3. The third submodel is a physical one and evaluates the instantaneous amount of air present in the chamber oil. It takes into account the arrival of new bubbles through the check valve and the mass exchanges (diffusion, dissolution) between the bubbles and the oil bulk. This amount of air has a direct influence on the chamber pressure calculation made in the second submodel. Experimental validation of the model was conducted on an engine head. This engine head was feeded by an oil circuit in which the aeration could be controlled. Air was injected under pressure and oil aeration was measured in the HLA oil supply by an original sensor, the SMAC. Three sensors were placed in the valvetrain: 1. Acceleration on the valve head 2. Proximity on the valve seat 3. Force between valve and HLAThe model correctly predicted measurements on the valve train. The mechanical modelling and the experiments show and explain the problems of valvetrains when air is present in the HLA. The hydraulic modelling allows {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour of the HLA and especially of the check valve. The physical modelling and the experiments prove that the aeration in the HLA chamber is not only influenced by the aeration in the circuit and indicated some ways of controlling aeration...|$|E

50|$|The {{valvetrain}} {{features a}} number of innovations: friction reducing roller swing arm, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lash</b> adjusters which ensure proper clearances between the valve stem and roller swing arm, which significantly reduce valve tapping noise. The valve springs feature a beehive shape and smaller retainer. The reduced weight and spring load further help lower friction and improve fuel economy.

5000|$|The 1839 cc L B8 (sometimes [...] "BP") is {{not just}} a bored and stroked B6. Rather, it uses a new block with widened {{cylinder}} spacing. The bore is 83 mm and the stroke is 85 mm. This SOHC engine was used in various Australian Mazda 323s, the American 1990-1994 Mazda Protege, and in Canadian variants of the 323 hatchback. It came with four valves per cylinder (B8-ME or BP-ME).

50|$|In , the inline six engines {{underwent}} a major redesign for the EA Falcon and now featured a new {{single overhead cam}} (SOHC) crossflow aluminum head. The camshaft and auxiliary shaft are driven by a 'duplex' chain. The duplex chain drives the distributor and the oil pump shafts. The camshaft is supported on the cylinder head by using 'topless' bearings. Bearing liners are not used. The camshaft is held in position using valve spring pressure. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lash</b> adjusters mounted on the rocker arms are used to provide zero valve lash. As with all previous and current models, the block is cast iron, but with {{a reduction in the}} cylinder bore to try to reduce emissions.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in the 1997 model year, the 2.2-litre {{engine for}} 1997 Legacy and Impreza models had {{internal}} and external changes that yield an approximately 10% increase in power and 3% increase in fuel economy.Accomplishing this involves many factors, {{one of which is}} engine friction reduction. The pistons were coated with molybdenum to reduce friction. The thin coating reduces moving friction and reduces cylinder wall scuffing.The piston skirt was reshaped and the piston weight was reduced by approximately 100 grams. Compression ratio was increased to 9.7:1 by reshaping the piston crown. This eliminates the clearance that was available between the piston at TDC and the fully opened valve.Piston pin offset has been changed to 0.5mm (0.020 in). Piston to cylinder wall clearance has been reduced by increasing the piston diameter.Another source of high engine friction is the valve train. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lash</b> adjusters (HLAs) are always in contact with the valves. The hydraulic pressure of the <b>lash</b> <b>adjuster</b> must be overcome during operation and during the most critical time of engine start.To overcome this situation and to contribute to the total reduction of friction loss, 1997 and later SOHC engines have solid valve adjusters. The scheduled service of this valve train is set at 100000 mi. SOHC engines now use an adjustment screw to adjust valve clearance. Engines with the earlier HLA are recommended to use 10W30 or 10W40 oil year-round; 5W30 can be used at very low winter temperatures.The roller rocker cam follower system that was introduced on the 1.8L Impreza engines, is installed on all 1996 model year and later 2.2-litre engines. The roller assemblies are not serviceable separately, but the rocker arms may be serviced as individual units.The carbon composition head gaskets with integrated o-rings are interchangeable from left to right on 1990 to 1994 NA engines only.Other Engine Modifications (2.2L 1997): The intake manifold has been reshaped to increase the airflow mass and speed, contributing to improved low and mid engine speed operation. Components located on the intake manifold have been relocated as compared to the 1996 models.

50|$|In 1982 the Nighthawk {{replaced}} the Custom {{of the previous}} years and featured a re-designed tank and side covers. In 1983-1985 a new DOHC engine {{replaced the}} SOHC engine used from 1979-1982. The new engine had <b>hydraulic</b> valve <b>lash</b> adjusters and was rubber mounted.

5000|$|The Cavalcade {{features}} a 16 valve DOHC 1360 cc V4 with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lash</b> adjusters and shaft drive for low maintenance. Many {{of the standard}} features on the Cavalcade were considered options on other motorcycles in 1985. The LX and LXE models feature self-cancelling turn signals, automatic rear pneumatic leveling system, rear suspension load pre-tensioner, air-adjustable damping on the front shocks that could be refilled with a standard tire pump connection, electronic cruise control, radio and cassette deck with LCD station display, volume and station selection controls on the handlebars, adjustment knob for the headlight, adjustable passenger floorboards, fore to aft top case adjustment for passenger comfort, adjustable handlebars and adjustable windshield. The radio is in a decorative housing that resembles a standard motorcycle fuel tank. The radio has an automatic volume control that raises and lowers the radio volume based on {{the speed of the}} motorcycle. The Cavalcade fuel tank is located under the driver's seat but is filled {{from the top of the}} decorative tank. A standard automobile-type oil filter is located midline of the underside of the chassis between the exhaust pipes. The engine is liquid cooled with a thermostatically-controlled electric fan. The radio antenna could be unscrewed and lowered so as not to interfere with the positioning of the weather cover, which was standard with all models.|$|R
50|$|Some engine {{variants}} have an intercooler {{in addition}} to the turbocharger, they can be identified by the tds. The M51 is an engine made of cast iron, it has one chain driven overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder. Compared to the M21 the M51 has now tappets and a <b>hydraulic</b> valve <b>lash</b> adjustment. The fuel injection in the first engines is controlled by the ECU Bosch DDE 2.1, which was replaced after the first technical revision by the DDE 2.2. This results in greater torque at lower revs. For lubrication SAE 5W-40 oil is used.|$|R
5000|$|Created as {{a refined}} luxury engine with {{improved}} {{power over the}} EA82T, Subaru introduced the ER series engine in 1988 exclusively to be featured in the Subaru Alcyone VX. Like the EA series engines, the ER series engine featured 2-valve cylinder heads with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lash</b> adjusters and the block shared the same bore and stroke. While recognised as bearing many similarities to the Subaru EA82 engine, there are numerous differences in design between the two engines and {{a large portion of}} parts are unique to the ER27. The oil and water pumps are unique to the ER27, sharing similar bolt patterns and design to the EA82, but being of a higher flow in both cases.The intake manifold uses a two piece design with a lower section bolting to the heads containing the coolant bridge, injectors and various vacuum lines. The upper intake manifold then bolts to the lower section and is unlike the EA82 or EJ22 [...] "spider" [...] manifold designs in that there is no central plenum chamber. The valve timing system is belt-drive using two individual timing belts, curiously one belt uses a spring tensioner (like the EA82) whilst the other uses a hydraulic tensioner (like the EJ22). Both JDM and USDM versions of the ER27 used multi-point electronic fuel injection. The ER27 designation was the first time Subaru incorporated the engine's displacement into the series name and all future engines have retained this nomenclature.|$|R
25|$|All Swifts (export models) got a {{redesigned}} {{front and}} rear fascia {{as well as a}} new dashboard. GS sedans received power steering and new hub caps. The 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine received a new cylinder head assembly: the engine of the previous generation used the same block and corresponding components but featured a head with valves in a V-formation straddling a single camshaft with rocker arms on shafts, whereas now the cylinder head assumed a much slimmer profile, owing to the valves now being in a vertical, inline configuration, actuated by inverted buckets also serving as <b>hydraulic</b> valve <b>lash</b> adjusters, all underneath a single overhead camshaft.|$|R
50|$|Tools {{and owner}} {{servicing}} were well thought out. The R65 came standard {{with a full}} tool kit, {{as well as a}} hand-operated tire pump. Owner maintenance is standard practice with these machines. Valve <b>lash</b> was <b>adjusted</b> by a simple set screw-and-locknut arrangement, and timing was taken care of by adjustment of the points' housing. On later models (i.e., model year 1981 onward), the points were no longer used and a Hall sensor was placed inside the housing, this housing behind the front engine cover is colloquially known as the 'bean can'. Most other maintenance tasks were easily achieved due to easy access to most mechanicals.|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{methods to}} enable the {{evaluation}} of important lubrication operational parameters at the contact between any cam and follower mechanism (excluding valve trains incorporating rolling element followers or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lash</b> adjusters) have been collated, critically assessed and developed. A robust and user friendly computer program, which incorporated these methods, was written in order that the tribological conditions existing at the cam/follower interface of any type of valve train in common use in today's internal combustion engines could be studied. The output from the program included graphical displays of frictional torque, minimum lubricant film thickness and Hertzian stress around the cam cycle. Such studies were performed on a cam and flat faced follower system, a cam and centrally pivoted follower system, a cam and end pivoted follower system and a desmodromic system (comprising a conventional cam and centrally pivoted. system and a desmodromic cam and end pivoted follower system). The computer program also allowed parametric studies {{to be carried out}} on valve train mechanisms. Parametric studies of three different valve trains, including the valve trains from the Rover 2300 and the Ford 2. 0 litre Pinto engines, have been presented, the results being presented in graphical and tabular form. The loadings, orbits, and power losses associated with the camshaft bearings of the Ford 2. 0 litre Pinto engine were evaluated using existing dynamically loaded bearing analysis techniques. The total frictional power loss predicted for the three camshaft bearings was found to be equal to approximately one fifth of that calculated for all of the cam/follower interfaces throughout the operational speed range of the engine. An experimental single valve desmodromic valve train apparatus was designed and commissioned to test the accuracy of the valve train lubrication analysis computer program. The apparatus allowed studies to be made of the running-in of valve trains operating at lubricant temperatures of 40 C, 60 C and. 80 C, by applying the electrical resistivity technique. Analytical models used to predict which cam/follower pair was in control of the valve at any point around the cam cycle were tested using an electrical continuity technique and were found to show good agreement with practice. Good agreement was also found between the theoretically predicted and measured torque and power required to drive the valve train. ...|$|R
50|$|The second {{generation}} Metro featured two engine options. The three-cylinder, 1.0-liter throttle body injected engine, still used on base models, {{was available for}} non-LSi models in 1997. The 1.0-liter became the last engine on a vehicle available in the US to use TBI. This generation also offered a revised 1.3-liter inline four-cylinder engine used in the Pontiac Firefly, with multi-point fuel injection (with <b>hydraulic</b> lifters and <b>lash</b> adjusters, and a 30,000-mile service interval). The 1.3-liter inline-four engine offered , and was the same engine {{that had been in}} use in the Suzuki Swift (except for the GT models) in prior years. LSi models produced after 1997 featured the four-cylinder engine with a sixteen-valve head instead of the eight valves of the earlier design, yet was still a SOHC design.|$|R
5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the valve spring retainer mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate <b>hydraulic</b> valve <b>lash</b> adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically set using a shim under a cam follower.|$|R
5000|$|The '91 GSX-R750M gained 15 kg {{over the}} {{previous}} model. The most notable feature of the [...] "M" [...] are the faired in headlamps and a slanted nose, {{both of which were}} designed to reduce drag. Also fitted was a new larger seat and new rear body work that featured twin tail lamps. This was the last GSX-R to use the oil-cooled SACS engine (except for US). Internal engine changes included a new valvetrain that used one dedicated cam lobe and rocker arm (finger follower) per valve (previous models used one lobe and one forked rocker per two valves). Valve clearance (<b>lash)</b> was now <b>adjusted</b> with shims (previous models used a screw and nut). The cam duration and indexing changed slightly as well as the porting according to a magazine article. The rear tyre width was increased to a 170 mm section width. The gauges also changed to white coloured needles (previously amber coloured).|$|R
40|$|Du graphe (P, V) de la {{compression}} d'un mélange gaz-liquide, on peut tirer la valeur du taux volumique de gaz dans le mélange. La vérification théorique et expérimentale de ce principe ainsi que ses limites d'application comme moyen de mesure sont présentées. Ce résultat a été utilisé pour développer un système de mesure de l'aération de l'huile moteur, le SMAC (Système de Mesure d'Aération par Compressibilité). Des exemples d'application, tels que l'étude de la sensibilité de certaines huiles à l'aération, sont exposés. Oil aeration {{can be a}} {{real problem}} in engine oil circuit. The involved lubrication power decrease and thermic properties changes can damage the engine. Furthermore, the increased compressibility is very dangerous for hydraulic systems like valve lash adjusters. A first step to control this aeration {{is to be able to}} measure it. Gammametry is often used but this measurement needs a very precise calibration and is quite complicated and dangerous. A new absolute measurement has been discovered, based on the difference of compressibility between air and oil. It is absolute because the measurement principle is independant of the conditions, The system does not need a new calibration at each new environment. It is valid for any gas-liquid mixture. From the (P, V) graph of a gas-liquid mixture compression, one can derive the gas-liquid volumetric ratio. The log-log graph (P/PO, 1 -V/VO) of a mixture sample pressurization always shows an inflexion point. The y value of this inflexion point (1 -V/VO) is equal to the volumetric gas ratio of the sample (before compression). This phenomenon is obvious on hydraulic curves (see Annexe 1). To check it, we have proceeded to a theoretical demonstration and an experimental verification. The theoretical demonstration of this principle concludes that the principle is verified as long as the ration P index 0 / alpha B is small. B is the oil bulk modulus, alpha is the volumetric gas ratio and P index 0 the sample initial pressure. Numerical simulations indicate that the pressurization must be regular and fast enough to avoid the problems coming from dissolution. They also indicate that small leakage could be profitable by decreasing the maximum pressure needed to meet the inflexion without modifying the measurement. The experimental verification consists in measuring the (P,V) graphs during the pressurization of different known mixture samples. The positions of the inflexion points of the log log graphs were compared with the known volumetric gas ratio. The correlation is very good and the deviations were inside the error range of the preparation of the mixture samples. Based on this principle, a system of oil aeration measurement has been developped : the SMAC (french name for Compressibility based oil Aeration Measurement System). The system is able to take samples from a given circuit by electrovalves. The sample is then regularly pressurized by a piston; pressure, piston displacement and temperature are stored along the time in a PC. The inflexion point is then determined, the gas ratio calculated and printed by a soft on the PC. The whole operation takes around three minutes. This apparatus has been used for two studies. The first one was dealing with <b>hydraulic</b> valve <b>lash</b> adhusters (HLA). The SMAC was measuring the gas ratio of oil in the circuit. The aim was to evaluate the influence of aeration on the HLA. The second study consists in defining a new oil aeration test method to measure the influence of silicone additives on aeration. Generally speaking, the SMAC principle can be used on almost any gas liquid mixture to measure the volumetric gas ration...|$|R
