25|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} physical features in Clinton Township is Penny Hill. This hill which is in the eastern portion of the township was named for a dog named Penny. Penny was apparently fond of wandering up and down the hill during the late 1780s and early 1790s. She was owned by a man named David Tolbert. Tolbert's dog was seen so often on the hill that the residents of the area began to call it Penny <b>Hill.</b> <b>Today</b> Penny Hill is bisected by U.S. Route 15. It overlooks West Branch Susquehanna River and is covered by a number of family residences and several small farms.|$|E
25|$|Just {{southwest}} of the parish church is a hill called Sacromonte, which overlooks the town and provides clear views of the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatépetl volcanos. (There is a lookout tower here used when Popocatépetl is more active. This hill has been considered sacred since the pre-Hispanic period, when a god named Tezcatlipoca was worshiped here with dances and ceremonies from 23 April to 12 May. These days were known as “Toxcatl” or “dry things” as these days usually were {{the end of the}} dry season just before the rainy season. An image of the deity was located in a cave {{at the top of the}} <b>hill.</b> <b>Today,</b> the hill contains the Sanctuary of the Señor del Sacromonte and a chapel dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe.|$|E
25|$|During this period, {{the town}} was mostly owned by three families: the Mallocks who owned the Cockington region, the Carys who owned Babbacombe, St Marychurch and the old monastery at Torre Abbey, and the Palk family which owned central Torquay or Tormohun. Tor Mohun {{takes its name from}} the tor or {{conspicuous}} hill known as Tor <b>Hill</b> <b>today,</b> and its suffix from the Mohuns who acquired the manor from the Brewers in the 13th century. The Mallocks resisted the changes convulsing Torquay for a long time because they did not want a town on their rural property, and they threw away a fortune rather than have it. It was not until 1865 that one of them consented to grant a building lease, and that only to a family connection.|$|E

500|$|After enclosure, [...] "civilisation {{came to the}} Fell". This {{began with}} the {{building}} of a new road. The only major road through Gateshead Fell was that which followed the same route of the ancient turnpike road which ran through what is now Sheriff <b>Hill</b> (<b>today</b> this is Old Durham Road/Sheriffs Highway). The turnpike road was very steep and was deemed rather unsatisfactory:Why should coaches have to labour up the long hill from Newcastle to the top of Gateshead Fell, and then go down the steep descent to the Coach & Horses inn just before Birtley, while those coming from the south had to climb and descend the hills in reverse? There must be a new road with better gradients...|$|E
500|$|Carr <b>Hill</b> <b>today</b> {{is shaped}} by the housing {{development}} of the 20th century. [...] A building boom begun in Gateshead {{at the start of}} the 20th century; large tracts of development at Deckham were matched by development in Carr Hill at Mafeking, Methuen and Baden Powell Streets. In 1911 an offer to build Sutton Dwellings was made to Gateshead Council and was staunchly rebuffed and in 1917 Parliament made a further proposal which was again rejected. However, a Gateshead Council survey concluded in 1919 that [...] "overcrowding in Gateshead was at dangerous levels, that landlords were scrimping on repairs and improvements" [...] and that housing levels were unsustainable in light of rapid population growth. [...] When in February 1919 the Town Improvement Committee recommended the purchase of [...] of land between Dryden Road at Low Fell and Carr Hill under the Housing Act 1919, the Council finally yielded and purchased [...] of land in Carr Hill and Sheriff Hill at the cost of £19,000. The result was that, in 1921, a large council estate was built in Carr Hill at Iona Road and the surrounding areas. The estate remains largely unchanged and shapes the suburb today, with only the width of Carr Hill Road (indicating a village green), the 'Old Brown Jug' inn and some stone cottages at Co-Operative Terrace remaining of the industrial village which once stood in its stead.|$|E

2500|$|The fairground, once {{outside the}} city, was chosen {{due to its}} natural suitability. The Sendlinger <b>Hill</b> (<b>today</b> Theresienhohe) {{was used as a}} {{grandstand}} for 40,000 race spectators. The festival grounds remained undeveloped except for the king's tent. The tastings of [...] "Traiteurs" [...] and other wine and beer took place above the visitors in the stands on the hill. Before the race started, a performance was held in homage of the bridegroom and of the royal family {{in the form of a}} train of 16 pairs of children dressed in Wittelsbach costumes, and costumes from the then nine Bavarian townships and other regions. This was followed by the punishing race with 30 horses on a 11,200-foot (3,400 meters) long racetrack, and concluded with the singing of a student choir. The first horse to cross the finish line belonged to Franz Baumgartner (one of the purported festival initiators).
