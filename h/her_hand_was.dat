5|$|Mary was courted by Duke Philip of Bavaria {{from late}} 1539, {{but he was}} Lutheran and his suit for <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful. Over 1539, the king's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, {{negotiated}} a potential alliance with the Duchy of Cleves. Suggestions that Mary marry the Duke of Cleves, who was the same age, came to nothing, but a match between Henry and the Duke's sister Anne was agreed. When the king saw Anne {{for the first time}} in late December 1539, a week before the scheduled wedding, he did not find himself attracted to her but was unable, for diplomatic reasons and in the absence of a suitable pretext, to cancel the marriage. Cromwell fell from favour and was arrested for treason in June 1540; one of the unlikely charges against him was that he had plotted to marry Mary himself. Anne consented to the annulment of the marriage, which had not been consummated, and Cromwell was beheaded.|$|E

500|$|Berengaria's first {{engagement}} {{was agreed}} in 1187 when <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> sought by Conrad, Duke of Rothenburg and fifth child of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. The next year, the marriage contract {{was signed in}} Seligenstadt, including a dowry of 42000 Maravedí. Conrad then marched to Castile, where in Carrión the engagement was celebrated and Conrad was knighted. [...] Berengaria's status as heir of Castile when she inherited the throne was {{based in part on}} documentation in the treaty and marriage contract, which specified that she would inherit the kingdom after her father or any childless brothers who may come along. [...] Conrad would only be allowed to co-rule as her spouse, and Castile would not become part of the Empire. The treaty also documented traditional rights and obligations between the future sovereign and the nobility.|$|E

500|$|Two {{scenes in}} which Stewie {{graphically}} beats up Brian using a glass filled with orange juice, various household objects, and guns polarized people who viewed it. Several production members were offended. Cast members—as well as MacFarlane's mother and an animal rights advocate—enjoyed the scene; MacFarlane quoted his mother: [...] "I don't {{see what the}} problem is? He (Brian) owed him (Stewie) money!", {{and so it was}} kept in the final cut. When Lois gives the finger to the camera during the interview with Peter and Brady, <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> blurred out on Fox airings of the episode. However, reruns on Adult Swim and TBS left the gesture intact. The gesture was also left intact on the DVD of [...] "Volume Four"; the production team enjoyed having this level of freedom. After the initial airing of the episode, where newscaster Tom Tucker announces a report on a fictional curse word, clemen, many viewers looked up the word on the Internet {{to try to find a}} definition. MacFarlane stated in the episode's DVD commentary that if someone invents an obscene definition for the word, the show will have to stop using it (it has not been used since this episode).|$|E
2500|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses instructed that if two men fought with each other, and to save her husband the wife of one seized the other man’s genitals, then <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> to be cut off. A closed portion ( [...] , setumah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|Christie's debut novel, {{from which}} she made £25 and John Lane made {{goodness}} knows how much.

5000|$|The next {{piece is}} a Female statue representation. <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> {{in the same}} {{position}} as those of Gudea.

The importance grows as we see <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> also clasped in prayer.|$|R
60|$|Cecilia murmured something. <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> moving nervously; {{she looked}} ill at ease.|$|R
2500|$|Christie {{describes}} what happens then: [...] "Inspector Kelsey was quick {{and so was}} Adam, {{but they were not}} quick enough. Ann Shapland had sprung to her feet. In <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> a small wicked-looking automatic and it pointed straight at Mrs Upjohn. Miss Bulstrode, quicker than the two men, moved sharply forward, but swifter still was Miss Chadwick. It was not Mrs Upjohn that she was trying to shield, it was the woman who was standing between Ann Shapland and Mrs Upjohn." [...] Chadwick is fatally wounded.|$|E
2500|$|... "By waiting so long {{to press}} charges in this case, State's Attorney Alvarez has done the McDonald family and the entire {{criminal}} justice system a heinous disservice. She waited until <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> forced by intense political and media pressure surrounding the release of this painful video. She waited even after City Hall was prepared to pay the McDonald family $5 million in damages." [...] Alvarez lost her bid for reelection in March 2016, earning 29 percent of the votes; Kim Foxx won with 58 percent of the votes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, she {{was awarded}} an honorary degree from USM, {{the first such}} degree awarded by the university. She {{received}} scores of awards and other honors recognizing her unselfish spirit, and President Bill Clinton presented her with a Presidential Citizens Medal, the nation’s second highest civilian award, during a special White House Ceremony. She also won the United Nations' Avicenna Medal for educational commitment. [...] In June 1996, Harvard University awarded McCarty an honorary doctorate alongside Maya Lin, Walter Annenberg, and Judith Jameson. [...] In December, <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> on the switch that dropped the countdown ball in Times Square on New Year's Eve.

2500|$|Ethan Mordden writes, [...] "It was {{a flawed}} voice. But then Callas sought to capture in her singing not just beauty but a whole humanity, and within her system, the flaws feed the feeling, the sour plangency and the strident {{defiance}} becoming {{aspects of the}} canto. They were literally defects of her voice; she bent them into advantages of her singing." [...] Giulini believes, [...] "If melodrama is the ideal unity of the trilogy of words, music, and action, {{it is impossible to}} imagine an artist in whom these three elements were more together than Callas." [...] He recalls that during Callas's performances of La traviata, [...] "reality was onstage. What stood behind me, the audience, auditorium, La Scala itself, seemed artifice. Only that which transpired on stage was truth, life itself." [...] Sir Rudolf Bing expressed similar sentiments:Once one heard and saw Maria Callas—one can't really distinguish it—in a part, {{it was very hard to}} enjoy any other artist, no matter how great, afterwards, because she imbued every part she sang and acted with such incredible personality and life. One move of <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> more than another artist could do in a whole act.|$|E

60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> cased {{in black}} mittens, and the finger-tips that drew {{in the paper}} slips were swollen as sausages.|$|R
