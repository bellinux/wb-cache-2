25|$|Vernon Hunter, a 68-year-old Revenue Officer Group Manager for the IRS, {{was killed}} in the {{incident}} along with Joseph Stack. Thirteen people were reported as injured, two of them critically. Debris from the crash reportedly struck a car being driven on the southbound access road of Route 183 in front of the building, shattering the windshield. Another driver on the southbound access road of Route 183 had his windows and sunroof shattered during the impact, and had debris fall inside his car, yet escaped uninjured. Robin DeHaven, a glass worker and former combat engineer for the United States Army, saw the collision while commuting to a customer's house for his job, and used the <b>extension</b> <b>ladder</b> on his truck to rescue six people from the 2nd floor of the building. By coincidence, the Travis County Hazardous Materials Team— an inter-agency group of firefighters from outside the City of Austin— had just assembled for training across the freeway from the targeted building, observed the low and fast flight of Stack's plane, and heard the blast impact. They immediately responded, attacking the fire and initiating search-and-rescue. Several City of Austin fire engines for the area of the Echelon building were already deployed at the fire at Stack's home {{at the time of the}} impact.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare energetic workload, perceived exertion, perceived discomfort, safety, and mechanical load at lower limb joints among window cleaners during usage of <b>extension</b> <b>ladders</b> with 30 and 35 cm rung separation. Eleven healthy male professional window cleaners of short and tall stature participated in this study. No significant differences between 30 and 35 cm rung separation were observed for the energetic workload. Results concerning the perceived exertion, discomfort, and safety indicate that 35 cm rung separation is preferred. Based on the mechanical load at the hip, knee, and ankle during ascending and descending the ladder, 30 cm rung separation is preferable to 35 cm rung separation. It is advised to climb ladders with the knees inside the side rails of the ladder, but this seems only possible with 35 cm rung separation. Findings of the presents study suggest that overall, a 35 cm rung separation is marginally favourable while using <b>extension</b> <b>ladders.</b> © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Ladder-related {{injuries}} are a persistent, and yet preventable, {{public health problem}} with significant economic impact on society. In 2013, approximately 511, 000 people in the United States were injured from ladders and treated in hospital emergency departments, doctors' offices, clinics and other medical settings. The financial cost of these injuries was $ 24 billion, including work loss, medical, legal, liability, and pain and suffering expenses. Falls-from-ladders are {{a leading cause of}} fall injury and death in all industries. In 2011, there were 113 deaths from work-related ladder-falls and approximately 34, 000 additional nonfatal injuries from work-related ladder-falls treated in hospital emergency departments in the U. S. Among construction workers in the U. S., about 81 % of reported fall injuries treated in emergency departments involved a ladder. These injuries can be severe and cause disability, changing the lives of workers and their families. Ladder angle significantly affects ladder stability. Research has suggested that ladder users tend to position <b>extension</b> <b>ladders</b> at suboptimal angles, which increases the risk of ladder slide-out events and associated falls. A ladder set too steeply or too shallow cannot provide safe support. Researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH developed, evaluated, and patented a method and technology for positioning <b>extension</b> <b>ladders</b> at an optimal angle. Relevant Information: 1) Among workers in 2011, approximately 20 % of the fall from height fatal injuries involved ladders. 2) In 2011, an estimated 15, 460 nonfatal ladder-fall injuries reported by employers involved multiple days away from work. 3) About 34, 000 nonfatal work-related ladder-fall injuries were treated in emergency departments in 2011.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the evacuation of}} apartment buildings {{with or without the}} help of emergency services. A pre-study has been made by Brandforsk; where, among other things, the emergency service as an alternative escape route has been analyzed. The purpose of the pre-study was to investigate the emergency services different rescue opportunities and to investigate the human behavior in case of fire and what kind of rules apply on how a building should be designed. The issue of emergency services as the alternative escape route have been raised by different people. Among other things by pointing out the difficulties regarding staffing. This was also mentioned during the interviews with the four different emergency services. The different fire appliances that are used by the emergency services are fire engines, portable <b>ladders</b> and <b>extension</b> <b>ladders.</b> The issues regarding these are that a height vehicle must align almost exactly with a building and people have a tendency to jump towards the basket and the fireman maneuvering it, instead of waiting until they can safely be evacuated. Portable <b>ladders</b> and the <b>extension</b> <b>ladders</b> {{take a lot of time}} and staff, dependent on the weather conditions and time of day. In order to facilitate accessibility to buildings, the property owners should keep the roads properly cleared and have a good accessibility towards the building. If it is too cramped and narrow for height vehicles to access to the houses or navigate narrow alleys, it might be an idea to introduce a similar mini-height vehicle as that of the emergency service in Östermalm. The emergency services sometimes encounter problems such as individuals whom have been evacuated from a building wanting to go back for their relatives. People however behave calmly and quietly when evacuating. It is important for the emergency services to know how people behave in case of fire, in order to perform effective evacuations.

These pulled up (by pairs) ¾" [...] plain ropes, toggle ropes, and rope ladders. The ropes and ladders were stowed in three large tackle boxes mounted down {{either side of the}} LCA decks and the rocket tubes were positioned down either side behind the corresponding boxes. In addition, each craft carried a pair of small hand-projector-type rockets, which could be easily carried ashore and fired small 100ft ropes.

5000|$|It {{has become}} {{increasingly}} common to provide anchor points on buildings to which the top rung of an <b>extension</b> <b>ladder</b> can be attached, especially for activities like window cleaning, especially if a fellow worker is not available for [...] "footing" [...] the ladder. Footing occurs when another worker stands on the lowest rung and so provides much greater stability to the ladder when being used.

5000|$|A guy-wire, guy-line, or guy-rope, {{also known}} as simply a guy, is a {{tensioned}} cable designed to add stability to a free-standing structure. They are used commonly in ship masts, radio masts, wind turbines, utility poles, fire service <b>extension</b> <b>ladders</b> used in church raises and tents. A thin vertical mast supported by guy wires is called a guyed mast. Structures that support antennas are frequently of a lattice construction and are called [...] "towers". One end of the guy {{is attached to the}} structure, and the other is anchored to the ground at some distance from the mast or tower base. The tension in the diagonal guy-wire, combined with the compression and buckling strength of the structure, allows the structure to withstand lateral loads such as wind or the weight of cantilevered structures. They are installed radially, usually at equal angles about the structure, in trios and quads. As the tower leans a bit due to the wind force, the increased guy tension is resolved into a compression force in the tower or mast and a lateral force that resists the wind load. For example, antenna masts are often held up by three guy-wires at 120° angles. Structures with predictable lateral loads, such as electrical utility poles, may require only a single guy-wire to offset the lateral pull of the electrical wires, at a spot where the wires change direction.|$|R
