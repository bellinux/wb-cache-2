25|$|The Jurun Marinalá {{electric}} power generation plant was planned as the first national hydro{{electric power}} plant in Guatemala. The goal was to disrupt the monopoly of the Electric Company, a subsidiary of American Electric Bond and Share (Ebasco), which did not make use of indigenous water resources, but ran fossil <b>fuel-powered</b> plants, thus creating a drain on foreign currency reserves. Owing to its massive economic importance, construction continued beyond the Árbenz presidency. The plant was finally completed under President Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro in 1968. It {{is located in the}} village of Agua Blanca, inside El Salto, Escuintla.|$|E

Most installed fuel fan heaters {{in the first world}} use a heat exchanger and external ventilation, avoiding that risk by venting the combustion gases to the outdoors.|$|E
50|$|Glasgow {{has one of}} {{the largest}} working milk float fleets in the UK. Most of the {{vehicles}} operate from the Grandtully Depot in Kelvindale. Some dairies in the UK, including Dairy Crest, have had to modernise and have replaced their electric milk floats with petrol or diesel <b>fuel-powered</b> vehicles to speed up deliveries and thus increase profit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{power of}} a vehicle {{electric}} motor, as in other vehicles, is measured in kilowatts (kW). 100 kW is roughly equivalent to 134 horsepower, although electric motors can deliver their full torque over a wide RPM range, so the performance is not equivalent, and far exceeds a [...] <b>fuel-powered</b> motor, which has a limited torque curve.|$|E
5000|$|Korea Space Launch Vehicle(KSLV)-II: The KSLV-II {{has been}} {{designed}} to generate a combined thrust of 300 tons by tying in parallel four 75 ton-class liquid <b>fuel-powered</b> engines.

50|$|With the {{direct-drive}} method, {{the propeller}} is attached {{directly on the}} engine's spinning crankshaft (or motor shaft). This arrangement is optimum when the propellor and powerplant share overlapping regions of best efficiency (measured in RPM.) Direct-drive {{is by far the}} most common when using a <b>fuel-powered</b> engine (gas or glow). Some electric motors with high torque and (comparatively) low speed can utilize direct-drive as well. These motors are typically outrunners.|$|E
5000|$|The press {{report that}} he {{followed}} the 1908 Glidden Tour route between Pittsburgh and New York was somewhat misleading. Fritchle appeared to retrace the Glidden route {{in only a few}} segments of that stretch, mainly in the area of Bedford, Pennsylvania. Close enough for him to emphasize that his electric had been able to traverse roads through the Alleghenys in November that the <b>fuel-powered</b> [...] "Gliddenites" [...] had found difficult to pass in July. He arrived at the Hotel Knickerbocker in Times Square New York at 6:00 p.m. on 28 November 1908.|$|E
50|$|In some places, such as Siberia, extreme cold {{requires}} that <b>fuel-powered</b> machinery {{to be used}} even part-time must be run continuously. Internal plumbing can be wrapped, and persons can often run water continuously through pipes. Energy conservation, difficult {{as it is in}} a cold wave, may require such measures as collecting people (especially the poor and elderly) in communal shelters. Even the homeless may be arrested and taken to shelters, only to be released when the hazard abates. Hospitals can prepare for the admission of victims of frostbite and hypothermia; schools and other public buildings can be converted into shelters.|$|E
50|$|At {{the next}} meeting, in September 1958, the designs had been further refined. Johnson {{reported}} on the Navy concept and demonstrated that it would require a balloon a mile wide for launching; the submission was then dropped. Boeing presented a new design for a 190 ft long liquid hydrogen powered inflatable design. Lockheed presented several designs; the Lockheed CL-400 Suntan looked like a scaled-up F-104 Starfighter powered by wingtip-mounted hydrogen-burning engines, the G2A was a subsonic design with a low radar cross-section, and the A-2 was a delta wing design using zip <b>fuel-powered</b> ramjets. Convair entered their parasite design, slightly upgraded and intended to fly at Mach 4.|$|E
5000|$|Fritchle's initial {{series of}} battery and {{automobile}} improvements culminated with {{production of the}} Victoria Phaeton in 1908, the twentieth anniversary of the electric car in America. [...] His choice of a competitive cross-country endurance run among electric vehicles {{as a means for}} promoting the capabilities of his new product was influenced by the positive effect the annual AAA National Reliability Tour, more commonly known as the Glidden Tour, was having on the durability and perceptions of <b>fuel-powered</b> vehicles. Though it had {{become one of the most}} prestigious American automobile events, electric vehicles were essentially excluded by the distances of the daily legs which frequently ran well over 100 mi.|$|E
50|$|Today's chandlers {{deal more}} in goods typical for <b>fuel-powered</b> {{commercial}} ships, {{such as oil}} tankers, container ships, and bulk carriers. They supply the crew's food, ship's maintenance supplies, cleaning compounds, rope, et cetera. The advantage of a ship's crew using a chandler {{is that they do}} not have to find stores in the town they have landed in, nor hold that local currency - assuming they are let out of the dock compound by the immigration authorities. Typically, the ship owner has a line of credit with the chandler and is billed for anything delivered to the crew of his ship. Chandlers are supplied by merchants close to wherever they happen to be.|$|E
50|$|Firearms are qualitatively {{different}} from earlier weapons because they release energy from combustible propellants such as gunpowder, {{rather than from}} a counter-weight or spring. This energy is released very rapidly and can be replicated without much effort by the user. Therefore even early firearms such as the arquebus were much more powerful than human-powered weapons. Firearms became increasingly important and effective during the 16th century to 19th century, with progressive improvements in ignition mechanisms followed by revolutionary changes in ammunition handling and propellant. During the U.S. Civil War various technologies including the machine gun and ironclad warship emerged that would be recognizable and useful military weapons today, particularly in limited conflicts. In the 19th century warship propulsion changed from sail power to fossil <b>fuel-powered</b> steam engines.|$|E
50|$|Megatron {{no longer}} has {{complete}} control over them, but is able to persuade Grimlock, Snarl and Swoop into destroying the Autobots and all fossil <b>fuel-powered</b> vehicles, after which they are trapped and imprisoned in a tar pit. Prowl and Bulkhead secretly transport the Dinobots to a forest island where they can live in seclusion and peace with nature, hidden {{from the rest of}} the world by a holographic screen. However, Grimlock accidentally figures out how to transform into robot mode, to the surprise of the other two Dinobots. Prometheus Black, also known as Meltdown, later threatens to melt them unless they serve him. The Dinobots reason that Meltdown is not one of them, so they transform to defeat him, and ally with the Autobots.|$|E
5000|$|A hybrid {{electric}} vehicle combines a conventional (usually fossil <b>fuel-powered)</b> powertrain with some form of electric propulsion. , over 11 million hybrid {{electric vehicle}}s have been sold worldwide since their inception in 1997. Japan is the market leader with more than 5 million hybrids sold, followed by the United States with cumulative sales of over 4 million units since 1999, and Europe with about 1.5 million hybrids delivered since 2000. Japan has the world's highest hybrid market penetration. By 2013 the hybrid market share {{accounted for more than}} 30% of new standard passenger car sold, and about 20% new passenger vehicle sales including kei cars.

5000|$|Electric {{power is}} often the chosen form of power for {{aircraft}}, cars and boats. Electric power in aircraft in particular has become popular recently, mainly due to the popularity of park flyers {{and the development of}} technologies like brushless motors and lithium polymer batteries. These allow electric motors to produce much more power rivaling that of <b>fuel-powered</b> engines. It is also relatively simple to increase the torque of an electric motor at the expense of speed, while it is much less common to do so with a fuel engine, perhaps due to its roughness. This permits a more efficient larger-diameter propeller to be used which provides more thrust at lower airspeeds. (e.g. an electric glider climbing steeply to a good thermalling altitude.) ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1938, Joseph Numero and Frederick McKinley Jones {{received}} the patent {{for the first}} transport refrigeration unit, the [...] "Model A" [...] and Thermo King was born. This landmark invention ushered {{in the era of}} frozen foods, large supermarkets and the restaurant industry as we know it today. Refrigerated transport also made the delivery of fresh produce anywhere in the country a possibility, regardless of the season. The concept of continuous cooling of perishables {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "Farm to Fork" [...] cold chain. With mobile refrigeration compressors driven by <b>fuel-powered</b> engines and stationary refrigeration compressors driven by grid-sourced electricity, the food is kept cold from the point of production through to the point of distribution to consumers.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{alternating}} and direct current power sources were used for recharging. These ranged from a dynamo borrowed from a physician's X-ray machine to a direct connection at a community power plant. Most of the garages he stopped at could safely recharge his vehicle, but in other situations he was often left {{to figure it out}} on his own. Fritchle acknowledged that touring in an electric car was only feasible for an [...] "expert electrician" [...] due to the complications of safely recharging from the variety of power sources and connections that existed at that time. He was not trying to portray electric vehicles as practical for cross-country travel, but rather demonstrate that his electric vehicles were as robust as the best of the <b>fuel-powered</b> automobiles.|$|E
5000|$|Cars are {{powered by}} various sources. Electric models are powered by small but {{powerful}} electric motors and rechargeable nickel-cadmium, nickel metal hydride, or lithium polymer cells. There are also brushed or brushless electric motors. Most <b>fuel-powered</b> models use glow plug engines, small internal combustion engines {{fueled by a}} special mixture of nitromethane, methanol, and oil (in most cases a blend of castor oil and synthetic oil). These {{are referred to as}} [...] "nitro" [...] cars. Recently, exceptionally large models have been introduced that are powered by small gasoline engines, similar to string trimmer motors, which use a mix of oil and gasoline. Electric cars are generally considered easier for the novice to work with compared to fuel-driven models, but can be equally as complex at the higher budget and skill levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fuel-powered</b> engines allow model cars {{to reach}} {{moderate}} speeds unmodified. Maximum power is generally achieved at medium to high speeds, {{and a slightly}} slower throttle response than electrically powered vehicles {{is to be expected}} due to clutching and lack of torque. Electric motors effectively produce instantaneous torque, whereas nitro engines, like full-sized gasoline engines, take time for the engine to spool up and for the clutch to engage. Nitro- (and fuel) powered cars may be refueled and returned to action in a few seconds, as opposed to electrics which require removal of the body shell and battery fasteners to replace a discharged battery. Nitro cars are cooled some by air, some by the oil mixed in with the fuel and may be run continuously with no need to take breaks for cooling down assuming they are properly tuned.|$|E
50|$|Nitro-powered cars operate like {{full-sized}} fuel vehicles {{more than}} their electric counterparts do, making use of a two stroke engine rather than an electric motor. The sound of the engine noise is a main selling points to nitro enthusiasts, even though brushless electric equivalents are generally faster and do not require special fuel. However, their exhaust contains unburned oil, which usually ends up coating the chassis. This, in turn, requires more cleaning than an electric-powered equivalent. Cleaning is usually achieved {{by the use of}} compressed air nozzles and solvents (such as denatured alcohol). Tuning a <b>fuel-powered</b> vehicle requires learning to maintain optimum performance and fuel economy, and to minimize engine wear and overheating, even in ready-to-run vehicles. Running a nitro-fuel motor without tuning or tuning improperly can hurt performance in rich conditions, and cause severe damage in lean conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The City of Montreal {{introduced}} the BIXI Montréal bicycle share system May 2009, {{in an effort}} to encourage locals and tourists {{to make use of the}} city's already well-established network of bike paths. The rental bicycles are available from depots located throughout the city, where bikes can be rented from automated stations using a credit card.Public Bike System Company, the former operator of BIXI (a combination of BIcycle and taXI) estimated that by 2009, 2,400 bicycles will be deployed at 300 depots throughout the metro area. [...] Time Magazine named the bike rental system #19 in Time's Top 50 Inventions of 2008. Bike rentals are also available at the Old Port of Montreal, as well as quadricycles, inline skates, children trailers, and Segways. The system was created to offer an attractive and easy-to-use option that complements existing public transportation networks for those seeking an urban alternative to traditional <b>fuel-powered</b> vehicles.|$|E
50|$|During {{the last}} few decades, {{environmental}} impact of the petroleum-based transportation infrastructure, along with the fear of peak oil, has led to renewed interest in an electric transportation infrastructure. EVs differ from fossil <b>fuel-powered</b> vehicles in that the electricity they consume can be generated {{from a wide range}} of sources, including fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewable sources such as tidal power, solar power, and wind power or any combination of those. The carbon footprint and other emissions of electric vehicles varies depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. The electricity may then be stored on board the vehicle using a battery, flywheel, or supercapacitors. Vehicles making use of engines working on the principle of combustion can usually only derive their energy from a single or a few sources, usually non-renewable fossil fuels. A key advantage of hybrid or plug-in electric vehicles is regenerative braking due to their capability to recover energy normally lost during braking as electricity is stored in the on-board battery.|$|E
50|$|An {{electric}} bicycle, {{also known}} as an e-bike or booster bike, is a bicycle with an integrated electric motor {{which can be used}} for propulsion. There are a great variety of e-bikes available worldwide, from e-bikes that only have a small motor to assist the rider's pedal-power (i.e., pedelecs) to somewhat more powerful e-bikes which tend closer to moped-style functionality: all, however, retain the ability to be pedalled by the rider and are therefore not electric motorcycles. E-bikes use rechargeable batteries and the lighter varieties can travel up to 25 to 32 km/h, depending on the laws of the country in which they are sold, while the more high-powered varieties can often do in excess of 45 km/h. In some markets, such as Germany, they are gaining in popularity and taking some market share away from conventional bicycles, while in others, such as China, they are replacing fossil <b>fuel-powered</b> mopeds and small motorcycles.|$|E
50|$|The {{input of}} the clutch is {{connected}} to the engine crankshaft while the output may drive a shaft, chain, or belt. As engine revolutions per minute increase, weighted arms in the clutch swing outward and force the clutch to engage. The most common types have friction pads or shoes radially mounted that engage the inside of the rim of a housing. On the center shaft there are an assorted number of extension springs, which connect to a clutch shoe. When the central shaft spins fast enough, the springs extend causing the clutch shoes to engage the friction face. It can be compared to a drum brake in reverse. This type can be found on most home built karts, lawn and garden equipment, <b>fuel-powered</b> model cars and low power chainsaws. Another type used in racing karts has friction and clutch disks stacked together like a motorcycle clutch. The weighted arms force these disks together and engage the clutch.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} ability to be driven {{for longer periods of time}} and the use of burning fuel, {{mechanical}} wear in nitro vehicles is generally greater than in electric vehicles. In addition, the increased weight of <b>fuel-powered</b> vehicles generally lead to higher speed collisions, causing greater damage to the collided vehicles, and a greater degree of safety concerns needs to be taken into account. Maintenance such as cleaning of the air filter and general chassis cleaning, replacement of worn clutch parts, proper after-run lubrication (necessary for storage) and maintenance of other motor-related items such as glow plug replacement makes for a more frustrating experience for first time RC users. In addition, nitro motors typically require rebuilding or replacement after 2-8 gallons (7-30 liters) of fuel run through them, due to loss of compression, which can be accelerated by poor tuning and overheating. It is also possible to seriously damage the engines by over-revving them with no load or ingestion of dirt into the carburetor. As such, nitro-powered vehicles are by nature expensive to maintain.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of sound levels, engine {{operation}} is of greatest impact with respect to mobile sources such as automobiles and trucks. Engine noise is a particularly large component of mobile source noise for vehicles operating at lower speeds, where aerodynamic and tire noise is less significant. Generally speaking, petrol and diesel engines emit less noise than turboshafts of equivalent power output; electric motors very often emit less noise than their fossil <b>fuel-powered</b> equivalents. Thrust-outputting engines, such as turbofans, turbojets and rockets emit {{the greatest amount of}} noise because their method of producing thrust {{is directly related to the}} production of sound.Various methods have been devised to reduce noise. Petrol and diesel engines are fitted with mufflers (silencers); newer turbofans often have outsized fans (the so-called high-bypass technology) in order to reduce the proportion of noisy, hot exhaust from the integrated turboshaft in the exhaust stream, and hushkits exist for older, low-bypass turbofans. No known methods exist for reducing the noise output of rockets without a corresponding reduction in thrust.|$|E

Scolded by Nine on their return, they agree to train with him and thereby sharpen their skills. At the culmination of this fight, Ella returns having read the letter from her Cêpan. It reveals that unlike the other Loric, she is not {{to become one of}} the Elders. Instead, her father comes from the family that once held the position of the tenth elder, but had since had it taken away. Her escape from Lorien was a fluke, a byproduct of her father's fascination with artifacts. He loaded her, her Cêpan and his menagerie of Chimæra onto an old, <b>fuel-powered</b> ship and sent it off the planet. He stayed with her mother, who was a Garde, to defend the planet, and fell with it. Ella's initial shock at this revelation makes her feel a fraud, but the other Garde reassure her and she decides to stay.|$|E
50|$|The A2 {{had many}} {{innovative}} ideas, {{such as the}} space floor storage system which was a box that slotted in the rear passenger foot well, a rear cup holder which unclipped, and a double (false) floor boot where items could be hidden from thieves or where the space saver spare wheel could be stored. The warning triangle and first aid kit are stowed directly {{to the left of}} the boot opening. The toolkit was stored, depending on equipment, next to the battery. If space was needed for the navigation system and/or the Bose subwoofer, it was moved to the sandwich compartment in front of the right-front seat (driver on UK cars, passenger on LHD ones). The headrests also do not need to be removed from the rear seats when they are folded, and a four-seater can have the rear seats removed in a matter of seconds. The rear seat belts have a clip in the upper section of the c-pillar, so that when the seats are folded and returned to their normal position, the belts do not get tangled.More examples of energy saving can be found in the glovebox light that only turns on when the lights are on and the freewheel pulley on the alternator belt, meaning that the alternator is only used when necessary. The climate compressor is also turned off when the ambient temperature drops below 5 degrees C.The ECON function of the climate control (where fitted) also turns off the auxiliary heating or the compressor, depending on temperature. This functionality is unaffected by the presence of <b>fuel-powered</b> or electrical auxiliary heating.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFossil <b>fuel-powered</b> {{vehicles}} emit significant particulate matter, for example, {{black carbon}} and primary organic aerosol, and produce secondary organic aerosol. Here we quantify secondary organic aerosol production from two-stroke scooters. Cars and trucks, particularly diesel vehicles, {{are thought to}} be the main vehicular pollution sources. This needs re-thinking, as we show that elevated particulate matter levels can be a consequence of `asymmetric pollution' from two-stroke scooters, vehicles that constitute {{a small fraction of the}} fleet, but can dominate urban vehicular pollution through organic aerosol and aromatic emission factors up to thousands of times higher than from other vehicle classes. Further, we demonstrate that oxidation processes producing secondary organic aerosol from vehicle exhaust also form potentially toxic `reactive oxygen species'...|$|E
