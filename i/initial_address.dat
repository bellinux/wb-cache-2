5|$|The <b>initial</b> <b>address</b> {{received}} a mixed reception within the Congo. In some quarters {{it was widely}} supported. However, some believed that it merely highlighted the fact that Lumumba was inexperienced (and overly provocative) in comparison with Kasa-Vubu's measured and diplomatic approach. Members of Lumumba's own party, including Kanza, praised the speech itself but believed that the venue in which it had been delivered was inappropriate. Lumumba's address was also notably acclaimed by figures within the international Pan-African and Black Power movements including Malcolm X. The speech may have further heightened racial violence between white settlers and native Congolese which were already distrustful. As {{a result of the}} threat to its expatriates, Belgium deployed troops to the country and, amid mounting violence, several regions of the Congo, notably Katanga, seceded and declared their own independence, starting five-years of violence and political unrest known as the Congo Crisis.|$|E

Olmos {{used his}} diverse ethnic background, and {{personal}} research, {{to help create}} the fictional [...] "Cityspeak" [...] language his character uses in the film. His <b>initial</b> <b>address</b> to Deckard at the noodle bar is partly in Hungarian and means, [...] "Horse dick ! No way. You are the Blade ... Blade Runner." [...] M. Emmet Walsh plays Captain Bryant, a hard-drinking, sleazy, and underhanded police veteran typical of the film noir genre. Joe Turkel portrays Dr. Eldon Tyrell, a corporate mogul who built an empire on genetically manipulated humanoid slaves. William Sanderson was cast as J. F. Sebastian, a quiet and lonely genius who provides a compassionate yet compliant portrait of humanity. J.F. sympathizes with the replicants, whom he sees as companions, and shares their shorter lifespan due to his rapid aging disease; Joe Pantoliano was considered for the role. James Hong portrays Hannibal Chew, an elderly geneticist specializing in synthetic eyes, and Hy Pyke portrays the sleazy bar owner Taffey Lewis with ease and in a single take, something almost unheard-of with Scott whose drive for perfection resulted at times in double-digit takes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Exploring data {{transfer}} and storage issues {{is crucial to}} efficiently map data intensive applications (e. g., multimedia) onto programmable processors. Code transformations are used to minimise main memory bus load and hence also power and system performance. However, this typically incurs a considerable arithmetic overhead in the addressing and local control. For instance, memory optimising in-place and data-layout transformations add costly modulo and integer division operations to the <b>initial</b> <b>addressing</b> code. In this paper, we show how the cycle overhead can be almost completely removed. This is done according to a systematic methodology which {{is a combination of}} an algebraic transformation exploration approach for the (non) linear arithmetic on top of an efficient transformation technique for reducing the piece-wise linear indexing to linear pointer arithmetic. The approach is illustrated on a real-life medical application, using a variety of programmable processor architectures. Total gains in cycle count ranging between a factor 5 and 25 are obtained compared to conventional compilers. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WOR...|$|R
