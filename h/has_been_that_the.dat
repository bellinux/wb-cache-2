5|$|The ongoing {{criticism}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> restorers {{presumed to}} know what end result the master was seeking to achieve in every separate case across the ceiling, and by what method he sought to achieve it.

5|$|Since {{the time}} of de Vaux, the default {{assumption}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Wicked Priest is a single individual, if {{only because of the}} appealing parallelism to the Teacher of Righteousness. The consensus time period for the founding of Qumran (150-140 BCE) includes five High Priests: three Hellenized and two Maccabean: Jason, Menelaus, Alcimus, Jonathan, and Simon, and also the various figures potentially associated with the intersacerdotium.|$|E
5|$|Hillforts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze and Early Iron ages, around {{the start of the}} 1st millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in prehistoric Britain and their purpose has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places from the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and, as a result, trading patterns shifted. The old elites lost their economic and social status and power passed into the hands of a new group of people.|$|E

50|$|And {{there was}} a {{recording}} contract. The Thompsons owed Island Records an album. The compromise seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> album to <b>be</b> delivered <b>was</b> to <b>have</b> a strong spiritual aspect.|$|R

5|$|Operating an {{air-breathing}} {{jet engine}} at velocities {{of up to}} Mach5.5 poses numerous engineering problems; several previous engines proposed by other designers have worked well as jet engines, but performed poorly as rockets. This engine design aims {{to be a good}} jet engine within the atmosphere, as well as being an excellent rocket engine outside; however, the conventional problem posed by operating at Mach5.5 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> air coming into the engine rapidly heats up as it is compressed into the engine; due to certain thermodynamic effects, this greatly reduces the thrust that can be produced by burning fuel. Attempts to avoid these issues has typically resulted in the engine being much heavier (scramjets/ramjets) or has greatly reduced the thrust generated (conventional turbojets/ramjets); in either of these scenarios, the end result would be an engine that possesses a poor thrust to weight ratio at high speeds, which in turn would be too heavy to assist much in reaching orbit.|$|E
5|$|Under {{a renewed}} {{agreement}} in 1999, {{all but one}} of the St. Louis County districts agreed to continue their participation, albeit with an opt-out clause that allowed districts to reduce the number of incoming transfer students starting in 2002. In addition, districts have been permitted to reduce available seats in the program. Since 1999, districts have reduced availability by five percent annually. A five-year extension of the voluntary transfer program was approved in 2007, and another five-year extension was approved in 2012, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 20182019 school year in participating districts. Critics of the transfer program note that most of the desegregation under the plan is via transfer of black students to the county rather than transfer of white students to the city. Another criticism <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> program weakens city schools by removing talented students to county schools. Despite these issues, the program will continue until all transfer students reach graduation; with the last group of transfer students allowed to enroll in 20182019, the program will end after the 20302031 school year.|$|E

5|$|General Eisenhower issued {{orders to}} {{preserve}} the building during the bombardment of Frankfurt, because he intended to use it after the war as his headquarters.

25|$|Another concern <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> extra {{glucosamine}} {{could contribute}} to diabetes by interfering with the normal regulation of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, but several investigations {{found no evidence that}} this occurs.

25|$|Since the 19th century, the {{prevailing}} scholarly consensus <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mounds were constructed by indigenous {{peoples of the}} Americas.

25|$|For a {{long time}} the {{prevailing}} view <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> very concept of quantum field theory — even though remarkably successful {{in the case of}} the other fundamental interactions — is doomed to failure for gravity.

25|$|The {{principal}} defect of the Central Intelligence Agency is {{that its}} direction, administrative organization and performance do not show sufficient appreciation of the Agency's assigned functions, particularly {{in the fields of}} intelligence coordination and the production of intelligence estimates.

25|$|Another {{major problem}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> safety foam {{used in the}} side of the car has caught fire, engulfing the driver's cockpit with smoke.

25|$|The general {{scholarly}} consensus {{since the}} time of Eoin MacNeill <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ulaid were kin to the Érainn, or at least to their royal families, sometimes called the Clanna Dedad, and perhaps not their nebulous subject populations. T. F. O'Rahilly notably believed the Ulaid were an actual branch of the Érainn. Also claimed as being related to the Ulaid are the Dáirine, another name for the Érainn royalty, both of which may have been related or derived from the Darini of Ptolemy.|$|E
25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs.

50|$|Due to {{the strong}} {{structural}} resemblance between the ocelloid and metazoan eyes, it <b>has</b> long <b>been</b> speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ocelloid functions as a photoreceptor; however, this {{is difficult to determine}} experimentally because warnowiids cannot be cultured in the laboratory, and isolates from natural habitats degrade quickly. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> morphology of the ocelloid changes in response to environmental illumination, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ocelloid structure can be disrupted by exposure to extremely bright light, and that it contains proteins with sequence similarity to known light-sensitive proteins. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ocelloid aids in detecting prey, possibly other dinoflagellates.|$|R
25|$|In 1976, Deborah Gardner {{was found}} murdered {{in her home}} in Tonga, where she was serving in the Peace Corps. Dennis Priven, a fellow Peace Corps worker, was later charged with the murder by the Tonga government. He {{was found not guilty}} by reason of insanity, and was sentenced to serve time in a mental {{institution}} in Washington D.C. Privan was never admitted to any institution, and the handling of the case has been heavily criticized. The main criticism <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Peace Corps seemingly worked to keep one of its volunteers from being found guilty of murder, due to the reflection it would have on the organization.|$|E
25|$|Radio galaxies, and to {{a lesser}} extent, radio-loud quasars display a wide range of {{structures}} in radio maps. The most common large-scale structures are called lobes: these are double, often fairly symmetrical, roughly ellipsoidal structures placed {{on either side of the}} active nucleus. A significant minority of low-luminosity sources exhibit structures usually known as plumes which are much more elongated. Some radio galaxies show one or two long narrow features known as jets (the most famous example being the giant galaxy M87 in the Virgo cluster) coming directly from the nucleus and going to the lobes. Since the 1970s, the most widely accepted model <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lobes or plumes are powered by beams of high-energy particles and magnetic field coming from close to the active nucleus. The jets are believed to be the visible manifestations of the beams, and often the term jet is used to refer both to the observable feature and to the underlying flow.|$|E
