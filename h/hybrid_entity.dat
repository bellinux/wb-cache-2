40|$|The need to {{maintain}} Australia as an attractive place for business requires that Australia's tax and corporate regulatory system be readily adaptive {{in responding to the}} increasing global business economy. Over the last number of years there has been the growing utilisation of new business forms around the world, known as <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities.</b> These <b>hybrids</b> <b>entities</b> often provide the corporate characteristics of a separate legal entity and limited liability for members, however adopt partnership taxation with the income and or losses being directly attributed to members. For example fifty-one states in the United States of America have introduced Limited Liability Companies, and its Federal Government has introduced S Corporations. Other examples around the world include the Limited Liability Partnership in United Kingdom and the Loss Attributing Qualifying Company in New Zealand. Given the growing international utilisation of these new business forms and Australia's only limited recognition of them, a thorough analysis of what have been the political and economic forces influencing this emerging global trend is important. With a thorough understanding of these key drivers preliminary conclusions can be made about whether these forces are likely to be present in Australia. Such conclusions will assist in determining whether Australia should expand its current offering of business forms to include hybrids. This particularly important to consider, as it is disturbing that Australia's current tax and corporate regulatory system may be generating an incentive for investors to adopt suboptimal forms to conduct their business operations.

40|$|The {{difference}} between a non-living machine such as a vacuum cleaner and a living organism as a lion seems to be obvious. The two types of entities differ in their material consistence, their origin, their development and their purpose. This apparently clear-cut borderline has previously been challenged by fictitious ideas of “artificial organism” and “living machines” {{as well as by}} progress in technology and breeding. The emergence of novel technologies such as artificial life, nanobiotechnology and synthetic biology are definitely blurring the boundary between our understanding of living and non-living matter. This essay discusses where, at the borderline between living and non-living matter, we can position the future products of synthetic biology that belong to the two <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities</b> “synthetic organisms” and “living machines” and how the approaching realization of such <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities</b> affects our understanding of organisms and machines. For this purpose we focus on the description of three different types of synthetic biology products and the aims assigned to their realization: (1) synthetic minimal cells aimed at by protocell synthetic biology, (2) chassis organisms strived for by synthetic genomics and (3) genetically engineered machines produced by bioengineering. We argue {{that in the case of}} synthetic biology the purpose is more decisive for the categorization of a product as an organism or a machine than its origin and development. This has certain ethical implications because the definition of an entity as machine seems to allow bypassing the discussion about the assignment and evaluation of instrumental and intrinsic values, which can be raised in the case of organisms...|$|R

However, the god's devotional popularity fell in about the middle of the 19th century. A Tanuki resembles a raccoon or badger, but its shape-shifting talents allow it to turn into humans for the purposes of trickery, such as impersonating Buddhist monks.

40|$|In recent years, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) {{project has}} been one of the biggest issues in {{international}} taxation. The OECD refers to BEPS as “tax avoidance strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations. ” In 2014, the OECD released BEPS Action 2 as responds on Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements (“HMA”s), which are arrangements exploiting differences in the tax treatment of instruments, entities or transfers between two or more countries. Two of the major factors of HMAs are <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities</b> and <b>hybrid</b> instruments. In Action 2, OECD recommends that counties introduce a “linking rule” that denies the deduction of costs which give rise to HMA outcomes in the payer jurisdiction, such as double deduction, deduction with no inclusion, indirect deduction with no inclusion, as the main measures for addressing HMAs. Among the 15 Actions of the BEPS Project, Action on HMAs is strongly recommended by OECD and G 20 to the 100 countries that plan to implement BEPS. However, considering the historical and economic background of each country, it is difficult to solve HMAs solely with the uniform introduction of a linking rule. Some countries have developed their own countermeasures to HMAs. To successfully counter HMAs, one needs to study the HMA phenomenon and research the current rules. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the ways of responding to the <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities</b> and <b>hybrid</b> instruments of countries including the U.

Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the [...] "thaw", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited traits common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a <b>hybrid</b> <b>entity</b> containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states.

40|$|While many {{political}} developments affected American small businesses during the twentieth century, {{the enactment of}} Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code was of particular significance. For the first time Congress was inclined to, at least partially, eliminate the double tax burden. Following the S Corporation, state legislatures formed other <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities</b> and gradually reduced the barriers to limited liability and other non-tax characteristics of organizational choice. Today, we observe a steady {{increase in the number}} of <b>hybrid</b> <b>entities,</b> which indicates that people favor the pass-through approach for taxation. At the same time, it is apparent that the existence of different federal tax regimes still plays a significant role in investors' choice of action. This article begins with the question: How did the American small business community achieve political victory where large organizations had failed? Put differently, how was it that the "little fellow" accomplished the almost impossible [...] the elimination of double taxation and permission to essentially choose his tax treatment [...] when, for years, the business community was unsuccessful in its attempts to integrate corporate and individual taxation? By laying out the untold story behind the enactment of Subchapter S, this article argues that three major factors paved the way for the creation of the S Corporation: a genuine economic need to aid small business entrepreneurs in times of recession, strong political pressure from the business sector, and political elite- such as Wilbur Mills, who thought the moment was right to aid small concerns. The story of enacting Subchapter S in 1958 is more than adding another organizational tax choice. It serves as an example of Congress's way of thinking about tax policy as instrumental in implementing social and economic goals. It elucidates a more complex picture of how tax policy evolved in the postwar period. It also reveals one way in which political interest groups affected the process of legislative decision making...|$|R
50|$|Miiyabin Marten and {{her friend}} Heather return to the forest in Moosonee, Ontario, where Miiyahbin swears that she saw American heroes {{fighting}} monsters. Though Heather doesn't believe her at first, they soon see for themselves that the secret alien base the heroes uncovered there remains there. While they explore it, they are suddenly attacked by a horrifying creature who grabs Miiyahbin. When Heather turns to look for her, she is gone. Meanwhile on the planet Rann, Stargirl {{and her friend}}s try to get their bearings, having been suddenly teleported into what Martian Manhunter can only determine is in the Polaris System. The realization {{that they are not}} in Canada anymore leads Green Arrow and Animal Man to fall into a bickering match which they become so consumed by that they fail to notice the monster they'd fought the day before has caught up with them, and threatens to crush them under-foot. Stargirl is wary of using her Cosmic Staff to fight the thing, because every time she hits it with a beam from the rod, the creature changes forms where some forms are harder to fight off than others. Fortunately, they have unexpected help from Supergirl. Before Supergirl can deal with the creature herself, both the creature and the Earth superheroes are confined to containment fields. The stasis shells were activated by the natives of the planet, who explain that the rogue <b>hybrid</b> <b>entity</b> the heroes have been fighting feeds on cosmic energy and by reducing its access to that stimulus (the Cosmic Rod), they can shrink it down to a manageable size. The leader of these people named Sardath explains that they are on his planet of Rann and that the alien visitors must remain his prisoners until he determines that they are not a threat. When Sardath realizes that Martian Manhunter is a Martian, he becomes worried about psychic invasions. Sardath he is too slow to prevent Martian Manhunter from stepping through the stasis shell and grabbing him to demand just what is going on. Meanwhile on the Moon of Thalsalla, Byth Rok reveals the child Ultra the Multi-Alien who is a hybrid of multiple aliens. One day, he explains to Alanna Lewis that this baby will grow into the most powerful creature in the universe. Hearing that the prisoners will no longer be needed for DNA samples, Lobo is eager to see them all killed, but he is attacked suddenly by Hawkman and the other escapees. He is disgusted to see Byth there after the Daemonite incursions on Thanagar. While he and Lobo fight, Byth becomes preoccupied with Ultra the Multi-Alien warning that the time of the baby's awakening is upon them. Sardath explains that his people are pacifists which is part of what caused the problems they now face. The Zeta Beam was what brought the visitors to Rann and they are the first humans ever to make that journey which means they don't have Adam Strange's fiancée Alanna with them. Still there are more questions to be answered such as what the Rannians were doing in the bunker in Moosonee not to mention the <b>hybrid</b> <b>entity.</b> Sardath explains that the things the heroes encountered down there only became threats after Byth got hold of them and he is likely responsible for Alanna's disappearance. Everything that has occurred began with the best intentions as something called the Ultra Project. Sardath explains that the Polaris and Vega Star Systems have been plagued for years by interplanetary war. Thanagar and Czarnia had been at the heart of it for some time, but others like Psion and Tamaran have stakes in the conflict. As such, aliens like the Dominators and Daemonites have taken advantage of the instability. Rann has stayed neutral using technological prowess and ingenuity as their own strengths, but neutrality led to their being caught in the middle. They began to take on refugees and of like minds, they worked together to bring about a ceasefire. However, they knew the conflict would reach a boiling point again and it was suggested that they create a weapon. Sardath opposed this suggesting instead that they create a symbol of unity in a child whose genetic heritage would come from all of the races with a stake in the system. This would be Ultra, a multi-alien and a being of pure science. However, they knew that they could not simply make the child representative of a few planets. It was necessary to get samples from every planet in the galaxy including Earth. Nobody was harmed or kidnapped until Byth found out about the project. He discovered the Earth lab and used his abilities to pose as Sardath to infiltrate the team. He killed them, returned to Rann, and took the project for himself. Sardath's people have since tracked Byth to the Thanagarian moon of Thalsalla. When he learned this, he attempted to contact some of Earth's super-humans to ask for help. But if the shared look of suspicion on his guests' faces are any indication, it is not going well. Despite that, Martian Manhunter concedes that it is only just that they help {{for the sake of the}} galaxy. Meanwhile, Byth is eagerly anticipating the imminent awakening of Ultra the Multi-Alien when the Justice League arrives via Zeta Beam. Happily, Adam reunites with Alanna. Unfortunately, they are all too late to stop Byth's plan and the baby's awakening is punctuated by a violent blast of energy.|$|E
