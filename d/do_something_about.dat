5|$|In the 1890s {{some people}} – {{including}} the young Calogero Vizzini – decided to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> {{the absence of}} peace and security in the countryside. The state police {{at the time was}} as much a danger as the brigands. The Villalba Mafia thus emerged as an alternative social regime centred on the membership in church-sponsored associations that generated considerable social capital. It later transformed into a protection racket, victimizing villagers and landowners alike through violence, intimidation and omertà.|$|E

When {{one of the}} bartenders {{suggests}} hiring a babysitter, Carla replied that the caller was the babysitter. The cast {{did not know the}} ending of the pilot episode during production, since the final draft of the script was dated April 16, 1982.|$|E
5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as {{if they are going to}} <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E

5|$|Toby {{had been}} {{discussing}} {{the details of}} the Scranton Strangler case with Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) for some time. Having grown weary of the subject, she snaps at him that he should <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it, or stop talking. Toby accordingly goes to the local prison to talk to the person convicted of being the notorious local murderer and tell him he believes he is innocent. Offscreen, the convict begins strangling Toby for his part in the conviction. However, Toby does have his spirits lifted after Nellie gives him a lift from the hospital and commends him for his bravery.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{her return}} from Rome, Violante Beatrice and the Electress Anna Maria Luisa decided to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Gian Gastone's public {{image and the}} Ruspanti, his entourage. In order to {{distract}} him from the Ruspanti, Violante Beatrice threw banquets, to which she invited the foremost members of Tuscan society. The Grand Duke's behaviour, vomiting, belching and cracking rude jokes, literally sent the guests scrambling to leave. The Electress was more fortunate for her part. She succeeded in making Gian Gastone appear on Saint John the Baptist's day, 1729. However, during the ceremony, the Grand Duke became so intoxicated {{that he had to}} be dragged back to his palace, the Pitti, on a litter.|$|E
5|$|He was {{diagnosed}} with paranoid schizophrenia six years before the shooting and spent fifty-three days in a mental hospital after threatening a Montana resident. He was released after testing as being of no danger to himself or anyone else. Eighteen months before the shooting, he moved back to Valmeyer from Montana. Once home, {{he was known to}} compulsively hack at trees which filled his back yard following the Mississippi River floods of 1993. There was so much downed timber on his family's homestead that they had to ask him to stop cutting at trees. Two days prior to the Capitol shooting, at his grandmother's insistence to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> nearby cats which were becoming a nuisance, Weston shot and killed 14 cats with a single-barreled shotgun, leaving several in a bucket and burying the rest.|$|E

5|$|Ferdinando beseeched Louis XIV to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> his daughter-in-law's behaviour; he {{sent the}} Comte de Saint Mêmê. Marguerite Louise wanted to return to France, and Mêmê sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he left without finding a {{solution}} to the heir's domestic disharmony, incensing both Ferdinando and Louis XIV. She humiliated Cosimo at every chance she got: she insisted on employing French cooks, as she feared the Medici would poison her. In September 1664 Marguerite Louise abandoned her apartments in the Pitti, the grand ducal palace. Cosimo moved her into Villa Lapeggi. Here, she was watched by forty soldiers, and six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere. The next year she reconciled with the grand ducal family, and gave birth to Anna Maria Luisa, future Electress Palatine, in August 1667. The delicate rapprochement that existed between Marguerite Louise {{and the rest of the}} family collapsed after Anna Maria Luisa's birth, when Marguerite Louise caught smallpox and decided to blame Cosimo for all her problems.|$|E
5|$|Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer {{discuss the}} {{situation}} and Kramer urges Jerry to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it, but Elaine argues that Rava will no longer let her edit her book if Jerry does this. Jerry calls Ray and has lunch with him, while George sits in the next booth and eavesdrops on their conversation. Jerry and George asks him about the statue, but Ray gets offended and leaves when he hears their opinion. Elaine and Rava get into an argument about Jerry's accusation, and Elaine is no longer allowed to edit Rava's book. Without notifying anybody, Kramer dresses up in Irving's old clothes and goes to Ray's apartment, {{pretending to be a}} cop, and recovers the statue, despite Ray's protests. Kramer returns the statue to a grateful George. But while George is holding the statue, Kramer gives him a friendly pat on the back, causing George to drop the statue, which breaks when it hits the floor. The episode ends without ever revealing whether or not Ray had in fact stolen the statue from Jerry's apartment.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{performs}} a science experiment {{to see if}} cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa {{as part of his}} project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe, and the people respond by sending a squadron of space ships to attack him. Lisa is shrunk and beamed down into the tub, where the citizens explain that they regard her as God, and they want her to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Bart, whom they regard as the Devil. She says she can help them if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not figured out the technology to do that. Bart grabs the tub and submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. Realizing that she is now stuck in the small universe forever, Lisa orders her citizens to grovel and bring her some shoes.|$|E

5|$|Sol and Naz {{spend the}} night {{together}} but at later dance rehearsals, Asher gives Naz her necklace back, and Sol sees this. He confronts Naz about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. Sol punches Asher, saying his brother has betrayed him, and a fight breaks out, but is broken up by Skolla and the other dancers. Skolla tells Sol and Asher they are both out {{of the group and}} reveals that Asher bought Sol's place. Sol goes back home to his mother but a neighbour tells him she has been taken away. Back in Walford, Naz insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. Stevie attempts to get them to reconcile by locking them in the flat and pretending to swallow the key, but Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol says she can stay there. Sol and Naz get close again but Asher interrupts them when he returns drunk. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. Asher finds Sol with their mother in hospital, and tells Sol he is better off with him than their mother as she is schizophrenic and has stabbed Asher. Sol says Asher is the problem and leaves. Asher finds him and apologises for Naz and says she did not get Sol's text message because he deleted it, and tells Sol that Naz loves him and he should <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it. Sol returns to Walford again as Naz is leaving, and stops Ekin's car. Naz gets out and they kiss. Asher tells him he can dance at the dance-off, but when his name is called, he is unsure and calls for Asher, saying he needs him. Asher tells him he can do it on his own. Everyone cheers him after his routine and he is called one of the best dancers.|$|E
