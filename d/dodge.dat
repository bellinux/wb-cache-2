While <b>Dodge</b> {{was on his way}} to visit the brigade, he heard a rifle shot from a group of Native Americans. <b>Dodge</b> quickly returned to his command post and gathered as many men as he could to pursue the enemy. With <b>Dodge</b> in quick pursuit, a group of approximately 25 Native warriors criss-crossed the Pecatonica River until, finding flight hopeless, they prepared to make a stand at the Battle of Pecatonica.|$|E

Hartman and <b>Dodge</b> shared kickoff duty. <b>Dodge</b> had fourkickoffs, {{compared}} with Hartman's three. <b>Dodge</b> averaged 60.5yards per kick, while Hartman averaged 57yards. In addition, Hartman added sixpoints to the scoreboard from field goal attempts. He was two for two, with the second field goal attempt being the game-winner in the fourth quarter.

5|$|According to {{personal}} {{accounts of the}} battle, after dismounting <b>Dodge</b> offered his men a chance {{to back out of}} the operation. No one opted out, and 21 men advanced with <b>Dodge</b> in an extended firing line, unsure of the enemy's location. The remaining eight soldiers were posted as guards on high grounds and near the horses. Unlike the disorganized and undisciplined troops at Stillman's Run, the volunteers at Horseshoe Bend adhered to military discipline; they waited for <b>Dodge</b> to give the order before they entered the thicket and swampland in search of their enemy, and once searching they awaited their commander's order to attack.|$|E

5|$|On June 11, <b>Dodge</b> escorted Brady to {{the mouth}} of the Fox River to confer with overall {{commander}} General Henry Atkinson. <b>Dodge</b> left the conference with clear authority from Atkinson to deal with the violence in the mining region. He first traveled to his home fort, at Gratiot's Grove, which he reached on June 13. The Spafford Farm massacre occurred the following day, and <b>Dodge</b> set out for Fort Hamilton as soon as he heard about it, stopping at Fort Blue Mounds for supplies. On the way to Hamilton, the soldiers passed a German immigrant, Henry Apple, exchanged greetings and kept traveling. Shortly afterwards the soldiers heard gunshots in the distance; Apple had met with a Kickapoo ambush, likely meant for <b>Dodge</b> himself. <b>Dodge</b> was probably saved by his last minute decision to make a detour from the main route. Later Apple's horse galloped wildly back past the men, wounded and carrying a large amount of blood in its saddle. The horse continued all the way to Fort Hamilton, where it raised a furor among the inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} Stillman's Run and Horseshoe Bend {{was filled with}} war-related activity. A series of attacks at Buffalo Grove, the Plum River settlement, Fort Blue Mounds and the war's most famous incident, the Indian Creek massacre, all took place between mid-May and late June 1832. In {{the week before the}} Battle of Horseshoe Bend, Colonel Henry <b>Dodge</b> of the western Michigan Territory militia was busy {{responding}} to various incidents across the region. On the afternoon of June 8, 1832, <b>Dodge</b> and his men, including James W. Stephenson, proceeded to Kellogg's Grove and buried the victims of the St. Vrain massacre.

5|$|<b>Dodge</b> {{noted the}} number of Sauk dead at 40, {{possibly}} more; he reported that Ho-Chunk scouts and militia men took at least that number of scalps after the battle. U.S. allied Ho-Chunk, during the night following the battle, scalped another 11 Sauk {{who had been killed}} by the militia, and <b>Dodge</b> had seen Sauk wounded being carried from the battlefield during the fighting.

50|$|Continuing {{financial}} problems meant that even <b>Dodge's</b> light-duty models - renamed as the Ram Pickup line for 1981 - were carried {{over with the}} most minimal of updates until 1993. Two things helped to revitalize <b>Dodge's</b> fortunes during this time. First was their introduction of Cummins' powerful and reliable B Series turbo-diesel engine as an option for 1989. This innovation raised <b>Dodge's</b> profile among serious truck buyers who needed power for towing or large loads. A mid-size Dakota pickup, which later offered a class-exclusive V8 engine, was also an attractive draw.|$|R
40|$|Image <b>dodging</b> {{method is}} one of the {{important}} processes that determines whether the mosaicking image can be used for remote sensing quantitative application. GF- 1 satellite is the first satellite in CHEOS (Chinese high-resolution earth observation system). WFV multispectral sensor {{is one of}} the instruments onboard GF- 1 satellite which consist of four cameras to mosaic imaging. According to the characteristics of WFV sensor, this paper proposes an image <b>dodging</b> algorithm based on cross/inter-radiometric calibration method. First, the traditional cross calibration method is applied to obtain the calibration coefficients of one WFV camera. Then statistical analysis and simulation methods are adopted to build the correlation models of DN and TOA (top of atmosphere) radiances between adjacent cameras. The proposed method can not only accomplish the radiation performance transfer, but also can fulfill the image <b>dodging.</b> The experimental results show the cross/inter-radiometric calibration coefficients in this paper can effectively eliminate the radiation inconsistency problem of the adjacent camera image which realizes the image <b>dodging.</b> So our proposed <b>dodging</b> method can provide an important reference for other similar sensor in future...|$|R
