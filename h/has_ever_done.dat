Zimbabwe has also competed at Wimbledon and the Davis Cup in tennis, most notably with the Black family, which comprises Wayne Black, Byron Black and Cara Black. Zimbabwe has also done well in golf. The Zimbabwean Nick Price held the official World Number 1 status longer than any player from Africa <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> in the 24-year history of the ranking.|$|E
5|$|Archie is {{visited by}} Peggy and he pleads {{with her to}} come home to him as she is the woman he loves. Peggy says she is not just a sweet and {{innocent}} old lady and that he has no idea whom he is messing with. She tells Archie if he does not leave the pub that night he will regret every cruel and evil act he <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done.</b> He tells her that unless she returns he will have the pub converted to flats. He then becomes emotional as he tells Peggy that he will be waiting for her as she walks out on him. Bradley walks in and punches Archie in the face twice but accidentally punches the bar as well, cutting his hand. He tells Archie to stay away from his girlfriend Stacey because she has said Archie raped her three months previously, and Bradley leaves. As Archie picks up his snowglobe from the floor, the bust of Queen Victoria is pushed from the bar and hits him on the head.|$|E

There are always tons {{of people around the}} set and Todd loves a lean set and it was always the opposite, so watching a director deal with that – especially when it was Todd Phillips – was interesting." [...] He then went on to say, in a later part of the interview, that [...] "it was the hardest shoot that I <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> that Zach <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> that Ed <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> and that Todd <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> done." ...|$|R

25|$|The pilot {{episode was}} {{broadcast}} on 1 January 1980. Hi-de-Hi! ran for nine series and two Christmas Specials, totalling 60 episodes, between 26 February 1981 and 30 January 1988. Because of the programme's popularity, the BBC decided to air series 3 and 4 back-to-back, {{the only time}} the BBC <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> this with one of their own (first run) shows, which means that some sources refer to both series as series 3.|$|E
25|$|His {{first class}} {{performances}} include many achievements. Nine times he scored {{a century and}} took 10 wickets in the one match. Twice he scored a century and {{took more than a}} dozen wickets. No other cricketer in the world <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> it. He is the only bowler in the world to snare 16 wickets in a match five times. He was the first to take 17. When he was 24 he became the first bowler outside England to get a whole side out with 10-66.|$|E

500|$|In Bright Lights, Big City, Fox {{played a}} fact-checker for a New York magazine, who spends his nights partying {{with alcohol and}} drugs. The film {{received}} mixed reviews, with Hal Hinson in The Washington Post criticizing Fox by claiming that [...] "he was the wrong actor for the job". Meanwhile, Roger Ebert praised the actor's performance: [...] "Fox is very good in the central role (he has a long drunken monologue {{that is the best}} thing he <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> in a movie)". During the shooting of Bright Lights, Big City, Fox co-starred again with Tracy Pollan, his on-screen girlfriend from Family Ties.|$|E
500|$|Opponents {{continued}} to make the carpetbagging issue a focal point throughout the race and during debates. [...] Talk radio hammered on this, with New York-based Sean Hannity issuing a daily mantra, [...] "Name me three things Hillary Clinton <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> {{for the people of}} New York!" [...] Clinton's supporters pointed out that the state was receptive to national leaders, such as Robert F. Kennedy who was elected to the Senate in 1964 despite similar accusations. In the end, according to exit polls conducted in the race, a majority of the voters dismissed the carpetbagging issue as unimportant.|$|E

[...] Writing for the Los Angeles Daily News, David Kronke failed to find the series very remarkable, writing that [...] "notwithstanding some lurid sex and gruesome violence, [...] as conventional as anything the network <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done.</b> Sword-and-sandals epics have become familiar Hollywood staples...and those expecting something that takes up where the legendarily decadent BBC/PBS series I, Claudius left off may be in for something of a disappointment." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode with a B.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bathurst, {{a former}} Footlights president, was cast as Mark Taylor. He was {{performing}} on a live topical programme on BSB called Up Yer News. A fellow performer {{on that show}} also auditioned for the part at {{what is now the}} Soho Theatre, then the old Soho Synagogue in Dean Street, and claimed that he would break Bathurst's legs if the latter got the job. In a 2005 interview, Bathurst recalls that the threat seemed not to be entirely jocular. Bathurst speaks very highly of Joking Apart, identifying it as a [...] "career highlight" [...] and the most enjoyable job he <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done.</b> Retrospectively, he wishes that he had [...] "roughened up" [...] Mark, as he was [...] "too designery".|$|E
500|$|... "I {{was stunned}} by their performance" [...] was Sinden's assessment. Former Montreal Canadiens' coach Claude Ruel commented that the Soviets' {{forwards}} {{were one of the}} most finely honed units he had ever seen. [...] "They are always moving, never standing around, they head-man the puck as well as anyone <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> — and they always seem to be in the right place." [...] According to Canada's goaltender Ken Dryden: [...] "We didn't play our game at all. After they tied it up, we started playing a panic type of game. Sometimes there were five men going for the puck at once." [...] At the end of the game, Team Canada accidentally snubbed the Soviets by returning to the dressing room directly without shaking hands with the Soviets after the game.|$|E

500|$|... "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] {{was written}} by Ken Keeler and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. It guest-starred Martin Sheen as the real Seymour Skinner. Although it aired during the show's ninth season, it was a holdover from season eight. The episode {{is one of the}} most controversial episodes of The Simpsons. Many fans and critics reacted extremely negatively to the revelation that Principal Skinner, a recurring character since the first season who had undergone a lot of character development, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by series creator Matt Groening, and by Harry Shearer, who provides the voice of Principal Skinner. Despite this, Ken Keeler considers the episode the best work he <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> for television. Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein have also defended the episode.|$|E

The next day, after the tank is impounded by Joe, the family is shown watching the CBS television drama Ghost Whisperer, with Jennifer Love Hewitt then appearing on screen. Meg then interrupts, and expresses her anger at her father for allowing the tank to be impounded. Her father then responds by stating that it is [...] "not the worst thing" [...] he <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> with a cutaway of Peter murdering Yogi Bear then being shown.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Ramsey Isler {{rated the}} episode {{with a score}} of 9.2 out of 10. He thought that after a [...] "stereotypical, over-the-top" [...] {{characterization}} in past episodes, Gaston [...] "stepped up his portrayal" [...] as Harris and was [...] "annoying... {{in a much more}} believable way." [...] Isler found the revelation surrounding Harris to be [...] "deliciously surprising," [...] and wrote that the [...] "last twenty minutes of the episode really ramped up the suspense and action." [...] However, the IGN reviewer thought that while the conversation with Grayson was an [...] "hilarious homage to Leonard Nimoy, it seemed completely superfluous in terms of the overall storyline." [...] Isler concluded his review on a positive note by focusing on Noble's performance, calling it [...] "one of the best scenes [...] <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> as Walter Bishop. It was emotional, believable, and perfectly accurate for a character that has a high level of self-loathing and remorse for what he's done, and the hopeless frustration {{of not being able to}} remember exactly why he did it." ...|$|E
500|$|Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club {{commented on}} the [...] "finality" [...] of the episode, noting that {{although}} the creators were still under contract until 2013, [...] "there are already scores of people questioning on IMDB boards and Twitter whether it was, in fact, a surprise series finale." [...] O'Neal saw {{the use of the}} Fleetwood Mac song [...] "Landslide" [...] (the only song in the episode that does not feature the sounds of defecation) in the episode's closing moments to have served as [...] "both a parody of a self-serious drama's season finale and an actual, self-serious, dramatic season finale." [...] James Poniewozik of Time remarked that the episode moved him to tears, commenting that it is [...] "one of those episodes that managed to combine the many different things lesser South Park episodes do individually: pop-culture parody, scatological hilarity and stories about childhood." [...] He described the dialogue between the Marshes as [...] "stunningly genuine," [...] summarizing the episode as [...] "simultaneously one of the most juvenile episodes South Park <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> and possibly its most mature." ...|$|E

Jyll Saskin of MTV {{said it was}} [...] "super trippy, makes no sense plot-wise" [...] and was a [...] "totally awesome Glee moment"; Entertainment Weekly Erin Strecker wrote that [...] "the entire cast deserved an MVP award for their completely on-point mannerisms", and singled out [...] "Finn and Puck all snuggly together, holding hands and dressed up like Kurt and Blaine". VanDerWerff, however, {{described it as a}} [...] "totally odd curiosity that comes out of nowhere", and said that the car trip taken by Tina and Rachel later in the episode was more successful at showing Tina [...] "what Rachel's life is like". Kubicek called the offer of the trip and subsequent drive a [...] "sweet bonding moment" [...] between the pair, and called it [...] "great" [...] that [...] "Tina is the one who saves the day" [...] at the meeting with Carmen, but Chaney wondered why it took Rachel two episodes to regain her drive and aspirations.|$|E
