40|$|The {{lightning}} current waveform has a {{major influence}} on the dynamic performance of <b>ground</b> <b>electrodes.</b> While high lightning current intensity improves the dynamic grounding performance due to ionization of the soil, very fast fronted pulses might worsen the performance in case of inductive behaviour. The previous analysis has often been based on quasistatic approximation that is not applicable to very fast fronted pulses. Previous Research focused on analyzing the impulse current dispersal regularity of different branches when injecting at one point. Comparing with the leakage current distribution of a single <b>ground</b> <b>electrode,</b> it is found that the leakage currents along the branches increase with the distance to the current feed point, and the more conductors near the injection point, the more uneven the leakage current distribution is. In this paper by simulation result we indicate that shielding effect should be taken into account when analyzing the impulse characteristics of <b>grounding</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Based on the simulation results, new empirical formulas applicable for slow and very fast fronted lightning current pulses are proposed. The effects of the ionization of the soil are disregarded; therefore, the new formulas are applicable for a conservative estimate of the upper bound of the impulse impedance of <b>ground</b> <b>electrodes.</b> In this paper we also analyze and compare by the MATLAB.

40|$|Differences in {{the liquid}} {{chemistry}} due to different <b>ground</b> <b>electrode</b> materials (titanium, stainless steel) were compared for corona discharges in water. The plasma was generated by applying positive high voltage pulses that {{are characterized by}} short rise times of about 20 ns, a peak voltage of 80 kV and pulse lengths of about 150 – 160 ns (FWHM). Phenol was admixed to the water for quantification of the bulk reaction chemistry, such as phenol decomposition and H 2 O 2 -formation. Optical emission spectroscopy was conducted to relate chemistry to plasma processes. Possible electrode corrosion was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The post-discharge chemistry strongly depends on <b>ground</b> <b>electrode</b> material. With stainless steel electrodes, decomposition efficiency of phenol increased by about three quarters (74. 9 %) when compared with titanium electrodes. This result {{can be explained by}} dissolved metal ions corroded from the <b>ground</b> <b>electrode,</b> which catalytically decomposed the H 2 O 2 that had been formed into hydroxyl radicals again. <b>Ground</b> <b>electrodes</b> were corroded due to electrochemical processes.
