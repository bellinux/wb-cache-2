40|$|Study of {{the revised}} Institute of Petroleum Model Code of Safe Practice for area {{classification}} of petroleum installations {{has raised the}} question of whether pressurized systems of high-flashpoint liquids (e. g. diesel, kerosene) should be considered hazardous in respect of their potential to atomize to produce <b>flammable</b> <b>aerosol</b> systems. This work collates relevant scientific studies to assist in investigation of the possibility of combustion hazards posed by these systems. It is envisaged that it will serve as an initial assessment in an area where industry acknowledges that insufficient information exists. A simple method is presented for characterizing liquid leaks in terms of their potential to atomize, which is considered a necessary condition to give rise to a flammable atmosphere. A cloud of very finely atomized liquid near stoichiometric concentration is shown to be hazardous with regard to a ‘low-energy’ spark. Empirical formulae for estimating the initial ‘average’ droplet size and the functional form of the volume of fuel contained in droplets that are less than a particular droplet size for this type of leak give an indication of the nature and potential severity of the hazard. These correlations need to be validated for use outside their ranges of applicability or to be updated. Information collated here facilitates what {{is likely to be a}} very conservative assessment of the hazard potential. Identification of areas where there is a dearth of information is just as important, and it is hoped that this paper will provoke further interest leading to improved methodologies for hazard quantification. However, at this stage, it has to be concluded that, even under low pressures, the possibility of creating aerosols that result in flammable systems cannot be eliminated for commonly-handled high-flashpoint liquids. Two practical illustrations, a large-scale study and a real incident, are given to support this conclusion. Finally, in the specific context of area classification, a simple solution to some potentially hazardous aerosol leaks is suggested...|$|E
50|$|The {{efficacy}} of thermal detonation is greatly {{limited by the}} flammability of some agents. For <b>flammable</b> <b>aerosols,</b> the cloud is sometimes totally or partially ignited by the disseminating explosion in a phenomenon called flashing. Explosively disseminated VX will ignite roughly {{one third of the}} time. Despite a great deal of study, flashing is still not fully understood, and {{a solution to the problem}} would be a major technological advance.|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of <b>flammable</b> <b>aerosols</b> presents a high potential for fire hazards {{in the process}} industry. Various industrial fluids, most of which operate at elevated temperatures and pressures, can be atomized when released under high pressure through a small orifice. Because of the complexity {{in the process of}} aerosol formation and combustion, the availability of data on aerosol flammability and flame propagation behaviors is still quite limited, making it difficult to evaluate the potential fire and explosion risks from released aerosols in the process industry and develop safety measures for preventing and/or mitigating aerosol hazards. A study is needed to investigate the relationship between aerosol combustion behaviors and the properties of the aerosols. This dissertation presents research on the combustion behaviors of <b>flammable</b> <b>aerosols.</b> Monodisperse aerosols created by industrial heat transfer fluids were generated using electrospray. The characteristics of flame propagations in aerosols and the influence of the presence of fuel droplets in the system are studied in the aerosol ignition tests. Flames in aerosols are characterized by non-uniform shapes and discrete flame fronts. Flames were observed in different burning modes. Droplet evaporation was found {{to play an important role}} in aerosol burning modes. Droplet evaporation behaviors and fuel vapor distributions are further related to aerosol droplet size, droplet spacing, movement velocity, and liquid volatility. The burning mode of a global flame with rapid size expansion is considered the most hazardous aerosol combustion scenario. This burning mode requires a smaller droplet size and smaller space between droplets. Larger droplet sizes and spacing may hinder the appearance of global flames. But when the liquid fuel has a certain level of volatility, there is an uneven distribution of fuel vapor in the system and this may cause the unique phenomenon of burning mode variations combined with enhanced flame propagation speed. Using an integrated model, the minimum ignition energy values of aerosols were predicted. The aerosol minimum ignition energy is influenced by the fuel-air equivalence ratio and the droplet size. Higher equivalence ratios, up to 1. 0, significantly reduce the minimum ignition energy, while larger droplet sizes result in a higher minimum ignition energy...|$|R
50|$|The {{copolymer}} mixture, solubilizing agents, and propellants {{are usually}} highly volatile and <b>flammable</b> (like most <b>aerosols).</b> For this reason, hair sprays have been classically used for combustion in potato cannons, {{and have been}} banned as carry-on items by most airport security agencies.|$|R
50|$|A potato cannon (sometimes {{known as}} a spud gun, not to be {{confused}} with a toy of the same name) is a pipe-based cannon which uses air pressure (pneumatic), or combustion of a <b>flammable</b> gas (<b>aerosol,</b> propane, etc.), to launch projectiles at high speeds. They are built to fire chunks of potato, as a hobby, or to fire other sorts of projectiles, for practical use. Projectiles or failing guns can be dangerous and result in life-threatening injuries, including cranial fractures, enucleation, and blindness if a person is hit.|$|R
5000|$|A {{flammable}} solid {{is one that}} is readily combustible or may cause or contribute to fire through friction. Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances which are dangerous if they can be easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly. it is further divided into • {{flammable solid}}s, • polymerizing substances and • self-reactive substances, i.e., thermally unstable solids liable to undergo a strongly exothermic thermal decomposition even without participation of oxygen (air) other than materials classified as explosive, organic peroxides or as oxidizing.Spontaneously combusting solids or pyrophoric solids are solids that, even in small quantities, are liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category {{on the basis of the}} outcome of the UN Test N.2. Self-heating substances are solids or liquids, other than a pyrophoric substance, which, by reaction with air and without energy supply, are liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances which on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of UN Test N.5, which measures gas evolution and speed of evolution. <b>Flammable</b> <b>aerosols</b> can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if they contain any component, which is classified as flammable.|$|R
40|$|The goal {{of these}} {{simulation}} studies was {{to demonstrate the}} capability of the GASFLOW computer code to predict detailed concentration distributions of toxic gases released in a subway station and in an airplane hangar, which represents an open building like a gymnasium. GASFLOW is a finite-volume computer code for solving transient, three-dimensional, compressible, Navier-Stokes equations for multiple gas species. It calculates the transport, mixing, and combustion of <b>flammable</b> gases and <b>aerosols</b> in geometrically complex domains...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} computer codes {{were reviewed}} by the In-Facility Transport Working Group for application to the in-facility transport of radioactive <b>aerosols,</b> <b>flammable</b> gases, and/or toxic gases: (1) CONTAIN, (2) FIRAC, (3) GASFLOW, (4) KBERT, and (5) MELCOR. Based on the review criteria as described in this report and the versions of each code {{available at the time}} of the review, MELCOR is the best code for the analysis of in-facility transport when multidimensional effects are not significant. When multi-dimensional effects are significant, GASFLOW should be used...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of <b>flammable</b> <b>aerosols</b> creates fire and explosion hazards {{in the process}} industry. Due to the operation condition of high pressure circumstances, heat transfer fluids tend to form aerosols when accidental leaking occurs on pipelines or storage vessels. An aerosol system is a complicated reactive system; there are neither systematic flammability data similar to the case with pure gases, nor clearly described ignition-to-combustion process of a droplet-air mixture system. The flammable regions of three main, widely-used commercial heat transfer fluids: Paratherm NF (P-NF); Dowtherm- 600 (D- 600); and Plate Heat Exchange Fluid (PHE), were analyzed by electro-spray generation with laser diffraction particle analysis method. The aerosol ignition behavior depends on the droplet size and concentration of the aerosol. From the adjustment of differently applied electro-spray voltages (7 - 10 kV) and various liquid feeding rates, a flammable condition distribution was obtained by comparison of droplet size and concentration. All of the fundamental study results are {{to be applied to}} practical cases with fire hazards analysis, pressurized liquid handling, and mitigation system design once there is a better understanding of aerosols formed by high-flash point materials. On the other hand, the process of combustion from initial stage to global flame formation was simulated with COMSOL-multi-physics in terms of heat transfer, droplet evaporation, and fluid dynamics of liquid-air interaction. The local temperature change through time, as an indicator of luminous flame appearance, was analyzed to describe the flame development and ignition delay time of aerosols. We have conducted a series of simulation regarding physical formula in description of this combustion process, and will conclude with how temperature distribution influenced the appearance of luminous flames, which was the symbol of successful ignition of aerosol. The mitigation implementing timing and location can be characterized with further understanding of this combustion process. The potential application of the ignition delay will be beneficial to the mitigation timing and detector sensor setting of facilities to prevent aerosol cloud fires. Finally, the scientific method of aerosol flammability study was discussed for its potential impacts on experimental results. A modeling point of view was introduced, with the analysis of electric field application on fuel droplets, and the related fundamental study of the ignition phenomenon on aerosol system. Existing charges from electrospray is beneficial for the monodispersity and control of aerosols for fundamental study. However, the additional charges accumulated on the droplet surfaces are likely to have impacts on flammability due to the excess energy they applied to the aerosols system and droplet-droplet distraction or turbulences. This is a re-visit of aerosol flammability study method, with a conclusion that charges did have positive impact on droplets? ignition concentration range with a balancing effect on turbulence increase to reduce the ignition chance...|$|R
25|$|A {{relatively}} small energy, often {{as little as}} 0.2–2 millijoules, is needed to ignite a flammable mixture of a fuel and air. For the common industrial hydrocarbon gases and solvents, the minimum ignition energy required for ignition of vapor-air mixture is lowest for the vapor concentration roughly in the middle between the lower explosive limit and the upper explosive limit, and rapidly increases as the concentration deviates from this optimum to either side. <b>Aerosols</b> of <b>flammable</b> liquids may be ignited well below their flash point. Generally, liquid aerosols with particle sizes below 10 micrometers behave like vapors, particle sizes above 40 micrometers behave more like flammable dusts. Typical minimum <b>flammable</b> concentrations of <b>aerosols</b> lay between 15 and 50 g/m3. Similarly, presence of foam {{on the surface of}} a flammable liquid significantly increases ignitability. <b>Aerosol</b> of <b>flammable</b> dust can be ignited as well, resulting in a dust explosion; the lower explosive limit usually lies between 50 and 1000 g/m3; finer dusts tend to be more explosive and requiring less spark energy to set off. Simultaneous presence of flammable vapors and flammable dust can significantly decrease the ignition energy; a mere 1 vol.% of propane in air can reduce the required ignition energy of dust by 100 times. Higher than normal oxygen content in atmosphere also significantly lowers the ignition energy.|$|R
