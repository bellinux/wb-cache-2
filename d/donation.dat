40|$|Using household-level data, {{we explore}} the {{relationship}} between <b>donations</b> {{to the victims of}} the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami disaster and other charitable <b>donations.</b> The empirical evidence suggests that <b>donations</b> specifically for the victims of the tsunami are positively associated with the amount previously donated to other charitable causes, which accords with complementary rather than substitution effects. This relationship exists when we decompose overall charitable <b>donations</b> into different types of philanthropy, with charitable contributions to caring, needy and religious organizations having the largest positive association with <b>donations</b> to the victims of the tsunami. When we explore the impact of <b>donations</b> to the victims of the tsunami on future <b>donations</b> to charity, however, our findings suggest an inverse relationship with the largest inverse association with <b>donations</b> to needy and caring organizations. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{charitable}} organisations do {{not produce}} commercially viable outputs and, consequently, rely heavily on private <b>donations.</b> As they operate in an increasingly competitive environment for <b>donations</b> and grants, organisational sustainability is increasingly a critical issue. Empirical results explaining levels of private <b>donations</b> to individual charities are presented and are consistent with a Cournot oligopolistic structure in the competition for private <b>donations.</b> Thus, the level of <b>donations</b> increases with an organisation’s level of fundraising expenditure, but the effect of inter-charity competition for grants reduces individual levels. Other influences on <b>donations</b> are volunteer numbers, government grants and organisational size and administrative expenditure. ...|$|R

40|$|Do {{corporate}} <b>donations</b> enhance shareholder wealth or reflect agency problems? We {{address this}} question {{for a global}} sample of firms whereby we distinguish between charitable and political <b>donations,</b> {{as well as between}} <b>donations</b> in cash and in kind. We find that charitable <b>donations</b> are positively related to financial performance and firm value, which is consistent with the value-enhancement hypothesis. This positive effect on firm value is stronger for cash than in-kind <b>donations.</b> In contrast, political <b>donations</b> do not appear to enhance shareholder value, but rather tend to reflect agency problems, as they are higher for firms with poor internal corporate governance and strong managerial entrenchment. We address endogeneity concerns by using peer firms’ <b>donations</b> as an instrument in a two-stage least squares (2 SLS) setting and by conducting a difference-indifference analysis around a general election...|$|R
