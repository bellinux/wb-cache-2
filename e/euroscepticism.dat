5|$|In the 1970s green {{became the}} color of the third biggest Swiss Federal Council {{political}} party, the Swiss People's Party SVP. The ideology is Swiss nationalism, national conservatism, right-wing populism, economic liberalism, agrarianism, isolationism, <b>euroscepticism.</b> The SVP was founded on September 22, 1971 and has 90,000 members.|$|E
5|$|The party gained over 7% in four constituencies. Much media {{attention}} {{was focused on}} the seat of Putney, where Goldsmith had stood as the Referendum candidate against incumbent Conservative MP David Mellor; Goldsmith secured 3.5% of the local vote and the seat was won by the Labour candidate. Although it failed to win any seats, the party exhibited the strongest performance of a minor party in recent UK political history. Support had been strongest in the south and east of England, in particular in areas with high elderly populations and high rates of agricultural employment. Support for the party was considerably weaker in Inner London, Northern England, and Scotland; it secured only 1.1% of the Scottish vote. This may have reflected greater pro-EU sentiment in Scotland or a perception that the Referendum Party's <b>Euroscepticism</b> was a form of English nationalism rather than British nationalism. The Referendum Party had proved more electorally successful than its Eurosceptic rival, UKIP, which averaged 1.2% of the vote in the 194 constituencies that it contested.|$|E
25|$|The Conservative Party has {{a variety}} of {{internal}} factions or ideologies, including: One-nation conservatism, Liberal conservatism, Social conservatism, Thatcherism, Traditional conservatism, Neoconservatism, Hard <b>euroscepticism,</b> Pro-Europeanism, Christian democracy, Localism and Green conservatism.|$|E
25|$|One of ADR's {{hallmark}} positions is its <b>euroscepticism,</b> {{and it is}} {{the only}} eurosceptic party in the Chamber of Deputies. It was the only parliamentary party that actively campaigned against the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which was put to a referendum and narrowly passed with 56.5% of voters in favour.|$|E
25|$|Since the UK {{referendum}} on {{membership of the}} European Union {{which resulted in a}} vote to leave, the Union Flag became a symbol of <b>euroscepticism</b> in Italy in August 2016 as hundreds of local businesses along the Italian riviera hoisted the flags as a protest against the implementation of the Services in the Internal Market Directive 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{involvement}} of the European Commission led metrication to be linked in public debate with <b>Euroscepticism,</b> and traditionally Eurosceptic parts of the British press often exaggerating or inventing the extent of enforced metrication. Example stories include the Daily Star, which on 17 January 2001 claimed that beer would soon have to be sold by the litre in pubs, something not demanded in any EU directive.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent times}} {{change has been}} more {{forthcoming}} because of external trade demands and intrusion in agricultural affairs by {{other parts of the}} EU policy framework, such as consumer advocate working groups and the environmental departments of the Union. In addition, <b>Euroscepticism</b> in states such as the UK and Denmark is fed in part by the CAP, which Eurosceptics consider detrimental to their economies.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Goodwin, Ford, and David Cutts {{published}} {{a study that}} identified <b>Euroscepticism</b> as the main causal factor for voters supporting UKIP, with concern over immigration levels and distrust of the political establishment also featuring as important motives. They noted, however, that during elections for the European Parliament, UKIP was able to broaden its support to gain the vote of largely middle-class Eurosceptics who vote Conservative in other elections.|$|E
25|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} in the UK in 2010 the FT was receptive to the Liberal Democrats' positions on civil liberties and political reform, and praised the then Labour leader Gordon Brown for his response to the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, but on balance it backed the Conservatives while questioning their tendency to <b>Euroscepticism.</b> At the subsequent general election in 2015, the FT called for {{the continuation of the}} Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition that had governed for the previous five years.|$|E
25|$|In September 1962, de Gaulle {{sought a}} {{constitutional}} amendment to allow the president to be directly elected by the people and issued another referendum to this end. After a motion of censure voted by the parliament on 4 October 1962, de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and held new elections. Although the left progressed, the Gaullists won an increased majority—this despite opposition from the Christian democratic Popular Republican Movement (MRP) and the National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP) who criticised de Gaulle's <b>euroscepticism</b> and presidentialism.|$|E
25|$|One {{concrete}} {{economic policy}} {{of recent years}} has been opposition to the European single currency. Anticipating the growing <b>Euroscepticism</b> within his party, John Major negotiated a British opt-out from the single currency in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, although several members of Major's cabinet, such as Kenneth Clarke, were personally supportive of EMU participation. Following Major's resignation after the 1997 defeat, each of the four subsequent Conservative leaders, including David Cameron, have positioned the party firmly against the adoption of the euro. This policy is broadly popular with the British electorate.|$|E
25|$|Poor {{economic}} growth across the European Union {{has led to}} mounting <b>Euroscepticism,</b> the rise of Xenophobia, and successful electoral challenges to the devolution of power from sovereign Member states of the European Union to Institutions of the European Union. France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Greece have signalled {{that they will not}} permit the transfer of any more sovereign powers to the Institutions of the European Union. On 23 June 2016 the UK voted by referendum to sever ties with the European Union (Brexit).|$|E
25|$|In April 2011, Portugal {{confirmed}} {{the receipt of}} a financial bailout from the IMF and the European Union worth €78 billion ($115 billion, £70 billion), following Greece and the Republic of Ireland. Some senior German policymakers publicly stated that emergency bailouts for Greece and future EU aid recipients should be accompanied by harsh penalties, which caused social unrest in Ireland and across Southern European countries, germanophobia, a big increase of <b>euroscepticism</b> {{and the rise of}} far-left and far-right parties in Greece (namely SYRIZA, Golden Dawn, among others), as well as the eurosceptic Five Star Movement and Lega Nord in Italy.|$|E
25|$|The reappointment of some {{of these}} members showed that {{individual}} Commissioners still maintained their own reputations despite the massive loss of face of the institution as a whole, while Cresson would {{have never been able to}} have been reappointed. The Commission itself suffered from a loss of trust and reputation, only compounded by the post-Delors mood. Prodi had to deal with increased <b>euroscepticism</b> which helped bring down the Santer Commission. Since the end of the Delors era, pro-integrationism had given way with greater concern about the Commission's powers. By just 2000 the Council curbed the Commission's powers once more when they believed Prodi overstepped his remit.|$|E
25|$|In parliament, Cook {{joined the}} left-wing Tribune Group of the Parliamentary Labour Party and {{frequently}} opposed {{the policies of}} the Wilson and Callaghan governments. He was an early supporter of constitutional and electoral reform (although he opposed devolution in the 1979 referendum, eventually coming out in favour on election night in 1983) and of efforts {{to increase the number of}} female MPs. He also supported unilateral nuclear disarmament and the abandoning of the Labour Party's <b>euroscepticism</b> of the 1970s and 1980s. During his early years in parliament, Cook championed several liberalising social measures, to mixed effect. He repeatedly (and unsuccessfully) introduced a private member's bill on divorce reform in Scotland, but succeeded in July 1980—and after three years' trying—with an amendment to bring the Scottish law on homosexuality into line with that in England.|$|E
25|$|In Poland itself, {{however, the}} Polish Socialist Party is {{considered}} 'pro-independence, patriotic left-wing' (in {{contrast with the}} internationalist left-wing) rather than left-wing nationalist. The term nationalism is used nearly exclusively for the right-wing national democracy of Roman Dmowski, and other officially far-right movements such as National Radical Camp and National Revival of Poland. Nowadays, notable parties and organizations that come the closest {{to the idea of}} a 'left-wing nationalism' are Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, under the leadership of Andrzej Lepper, and Zmiana led by Mateusz Piskorski. Both advocate patriotism (at times even nationalism), social conservatism, <b>euroscepticism,</b> anti-imperialism (strong criticism of a NATO and US foreign policies), and economic nationalism. The Self-Defence won 53 seats out of 460 in 2001 elections, and 56 in 2005. From 2005 to 2007 it was in the coalition government with two other parties (one right-wing, the other nationalist). Since then it has no representatives in the Polish Sejm.|$|E
25|$|Ideologically {{positioned}} {{on the extreme}} or far-right of British politics, the BNP has been characterised as fascist or neo-fascist by political scientists. Under Tyndall's leadership, it was more specifically regarded as Neo-Nazi. The party is ethnic nationalist, and it espouses the view that only white people should be citizens of the United Kingdom. It calls {{for an end to}} non-white migration into the UK and the removal of settled non-white populations from the country. Initially, it called for the compulsory expulsion of non-whites, although it has since advocated voluntary removals with financial incentives. It promotes biological racism and the white genocide conspiracy theory, calling for global racial separatism and condemning mixed-race relationships. Under Tyndall, the BNP emphasised anti-semitism and Holocaust denial, although Griffin switched the party's focus on to Islamophobia. It promotes economic protectionism, <b>Euroscepticism,</b> and a transformation away from liberal democracy, while its social policies oppose feminism, LGBT rights, and societal permissiveness.|$|E
500|$|Labour {{lost the}} 1970 {{election}} to Edward Heath's Conservatives and upon Heath's application {{to join the}} European Economic Community, a surge in left-wing <b>Euroscepticism</b> emerged. Benn [...] "was stridently against membership", and campaigned in favour of {{a referendum on the}} UK's membership. The Shadow Cabinet voted to support a referendum on 29 March 1972, and as a result Roy Jenkins resigned as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.|$|E
500|$|The Referendum Party {{nevertheless}} {{may have}} cost the Conservatives certain seats. Many Conservatives themselves {{believed that this}} was the case. As noted by Anthony Heath, Roger Jowell, Bridget Taylor, and Katarina Thomson from their analysis of polling data, [...] "voters for the Referendum Party were certainly not a cross-section of the electorate. They were predominantly people who had voted Conservative (and, to a lesser extent, Liberal Democrat) in 1992. Hardly anyone who had voted Labour in 1992 supported Goldsmith's party." [...] Their evidence indicated that just under two-thirds of those who voted for the Referendum Party in 1997 had voted for the Conservatives in 1992, although the analysis also suggested that many of these people were dissatisfied with the Conservative government and would not have voted for them even had the Referendum Party not existed. Heath et al. noted that [...] "voters for the Referendum Party were remarkably Eurosceptic but were unremarkable in most other respects. They show no sign of being right-wing on the economic issues of the left-right dimension and they were not consistently right-wing ideologues." [...] Those who voted for the party held a diversity of ideological positions, the only shared factor being their <b>Euroscepticism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|UKIP {{embraces the}} {{ideology}} of Hard <b>Euroscepticism,</b> also known as 'Eurorejectionism'. Opposition to the United Kingdom's continued membership of the European Union has been its [...] "core issue" [...] and is [...] "central to the party's identity". UKIP characterises the EU as a fundamentally undemocratic institution and stresses the need to regain what it describes as the UK's national sovereignty from the EU. It presents the EU as being an exemplar of non-accountability, corruption, and inefficiency, and views it as being responsible for the [...] "flooding" [...] of the UK with migrants, in particular from Eastern Europe. UKIP emphasises <b>Euroscepticism</b> to a far greater extent than any of Western Europe's other main radical right parties, {{and it was only}} post-2010 that it began seriously articulating other issues. Hayton nevertheless suggested that <b>Euroscepticism</b> still remains [...] "the lens through which most of its other policy positions are framed and understood".|$|E
2500|$|The United Kingdom, {{known for}} its <b>Euroscepticism</b> and {{relative}} isolation from Europe, is [...] "included" [...] as a missing piece (an empty space) at the top-left of the sculpture.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accession}} {{process of}} Croatia was {{complicated by the}} insistence of Slovenia, an EU member state, that the two countries' border issues be dealt with prior to Croatia's accession to the EU. [...] Croatian public opinion was generally supportive of the EU accession process, despite occasional spikes in <b>euroscepticism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The party's core {{ideology}} {{is based on}} Serbian nationalism and the goal of creating a Greater Serbia. The party is also strongly opposed to European integration (<b>euroscepticism)</b> and globalization, advocating for closer ties with Russia instead. The SRS is extremely critical of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), where Šešelj was incarcerated from 2003 to 2014. [...] The party regards former general Ratko Mladić and former Republika Srpska president Radovan Karadžić as [...] "Serbian heroes".|$|E
2500|$|The President is {{the former}} Prime Minister of Portugal; José Manuel Barroso. He took over from former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi who served from 1999 (Prodi Commission). He {{is a member of}} the European People's Party and was {{appointed}} by the European Council in June 2004 in response to the victory of the EPP-ED in the 2004 European elections. Some of Barroso's stated aims are to tackle voter apathy and <b>euroscepticism,</b> visible during those elections, to work with the United States and to develop a [...] "defence identity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dacre {{was also}} {{critical}} of David Cameron, then {{just over a}} year into his leadership of the Conservative Party: [...] "Today's Tories are obsessed by the BBC. They saw what its attack dogs did to [...] Hague, [...] Duncan Smith and [...] Howard. Cameron's cuddly blend of eco-politics and work/life balance, his embrace of Polly Toynbee, a columnist who loathes everything Conservatism stands for, but is a totemic figure to the BBC, his sidelining of Thatcherism and his banishing of all talk of lower taxes, lower immigration and <b>euroscepticism</b> {{are all part of the}} Tories' blood sacrifice to the BBC god." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{progression}} in {{the late}} 1980s {{is known as the}} [...] "Lepénisation des esprits" [...] or [...] "Le Pen-isation" [...] of spirits due to its noticeable effect on mainstream political opinion. Le Pen focuses on issues related to immigration to France, the European Union, traditional culture and values, law and order and France's high rate of unemployment. He advocates immigration restrictions, the death penalty, raising incentives for homemakers, and <b>euroscepticism.</b> His controversial speeches and his integration into public life have made him a figure who polarizes opinion, considered as the [...] "Devil of the Republic" [...] among his opponents or as the [...] "last samurai in politics" [...] among his supporters.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, he {{said that}} he [...] "nearly voted" [...] for the UK Independence Party, expressing his admiration for party leader Nigel Farage and {{endorsing}} his <b>Euroscepticism</b> regarding the UK's membership of the European Union. In October 2016, he praised the outcome of the UK's referendum on EU membership as [...] "magnificent" [...] and said the BBC had [...] "persistently denigrated" [...] supporters of the Leave campaign. In October 2017, he stated his belief that the then recently concluded UKIP leadership election had been rigged against anti-Islam activist Anne Marie Waters. During a live performance on BBC 6 Music, he said: [...] "I was very surprised the other day—it was very interesting to me—to see Anne Marie Waters become the head of Ukip. Oh no, sorry she didn't—the voting was rigged. Sorry, I forgot." ...|$|E
2500|$|UKIP {{began as}} the Anti-Federalist League, a Eurosceptic {{political}} party established in 1991 by the historian Alan Sked. The League opposed the recently signed Maastricht Treaty {{and sought to}} sway the governing Conservative Party toward removing the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU). A former Liberal Party candidate, member of the Bruges Group, and professor at the London School of Economics (LSE), Sked had converted to <b>Euroscepticism</b> while teaching the LSE's European Studies programme. Under the Anti-Federalist League's banner, Sked stood as a prospective Member of Parliament (MP) in Bath at the 1992 general election, gaining 0.2% of the vote. At a League meeting held in the LSE on 3 September 1993, the group was renamed the UK Independence Party, deliberately avoiding the term [...] "British" [...] {{so as to avoid}} confusion with the far-right British National Party (BNP).|$|E
2500|$|Johnson biographer Andrew Gimson {{believed}} that these articles made Johnson [...] "one of [...] most famous exponents". According to later biographer Sonia Purnell, who was Johnson's Brussels deputy, {{he helped to}} make <b>Euroscepticism</b> [...] "an attractive and emotionally resonant cause for the Right", whereas previously it had {{been associated with the}} British Left. Johnson's articles established him as the favourite journalist of the Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, although Thatcher's successor, John Major, was annoyed by Johnson and spent much time attempting to refute his claims. Johnson's articles exacerbated tensions between the Eurosceptic and Europhile factions of the Conservative Party, and it was these tensions which were widely viewed as a contributing factor to the party's failure in the 1997 general election. As a result, Johnson earned the mistrust of many party members. His writings were also a key influence on the emergence of the right-wing Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP) in the early 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|Ideologically {{positioned}} on the right-wing of British politics, political scientists characterise UKIP {{as part of}} a broader European radical right. UKIP's primary emphasis has been on <b>Euroscepticism,</b> calling for the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU). It promotes a British unionist and British nationalist agenda, encouraging a unitary British identity in opposition to growing Welsh and Scottish nationalisms. In doing so, political scientists have argued, it conflates Britishness with Englishness and appeals to English nationalist sentiment. UKIP has also placed strong emphasis on lowering immigration, rejecting multiculturalism, and opposing what it calls the [...] "Islamification" [...] of Britain. Influenced by Thatcherism and classical liberalism, it describes itself as economically libertarian and promotes liberal economic policies. On social issues like LGBT rights, education policy, and criminal justice it is conservative. Having an ideological heritage stemming from the right-wing of the Conservative Party, it distinguishes itself from the mainstream political establishment through heavy use of populist rhetoric, for instance through descriptions of its supporters as [...] "the People's Army".|$|E
2500|$|From their {{analysis}} of the data, Ford and Goodwin stated that UKIP's support base has [...] "strong parallels" [...] both with that of Western Europe's other radical right parties and with the BNP during their electoral heyday. Conversely, an earlier study by Richard Whitaker and Philip Lynch, based on polling data from YouGov, concluded that UKIP voters were distinct from those of far right parties. The authors found that voter support for UKIP correlated with concerns {{about the value of}} immigration and a lack of trust in the political system, but the biggest explanatory factor for their support of UKIP was <b>Euroscepticism.</b> A further study by the same authors suggests that UKIP voters' core beliefs align very closely to those of the UKIP candidates; particularly so on issues surrounding European integration, which has resulted in Conservative voters switching to UKIP due to Conservative divisions on this issue. One study found that 63% of UKIP voters considered themselves to be right-wing, while 22% thought centrist and 16% thought leftist. 81% believed that immigration undermined British culture, a view shared by only half the wider British population. On economic issues, there was a divide between UKIP voters and the party itself. In contrast to the party's economic liberalism, UKIP supporters often held more leftist attitudes to the economy, with almost 80% opining that big business took advantage of working people and almost 70% thinking that privatisation had gone too far.|$|E
50|$|Some {{scholars}} {{consider the}} gradual difference in terminology between 'hard' and 'soft' <b>Euroscepticism</b> inadequate {{to accommodate the}} large differences in terms of political agenda. Therefore, 'hard Euroscepticism' has also {{been referred to as}} 'Europhobia', as opposed to mere 'Euroscepticism'. Other alternative names for 'hard' and 'soft' <b>Euroscepticism</b> include, respectively, 'withdrawalist' and 'reformist' <b>Euroscepticism.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy {{group in}} the European Parliament, typified by such parties as the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), {{displays}} hard <b>Euroscepticism.</b> In western European EU member countries, hard <b>Euroscepticism</b> is currently a characteristic of many anti-establishment parties.|$|E
