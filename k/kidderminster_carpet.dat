50|$|The declining {{fortune of}} the Dudleys saw {{the sale of}} the court after the First World War to a <b>Kidderminster</b> <b>carpet</b> manufacturer. In 1937 a major fire caused great damage to the court, the estate was broken up and sold and the house was {{subsequently}} stripped of its fittings and furnishings. Forty years of decay followed before the house and grounds were taken into the care of Historic England in 1972. Since that point, significant restoration and stabilisation have secured the house as a spectacular ruin.|$|E
50|$|As for the floor, it is {{left bare}} if it {{consists}} of beautiful tile or paving; in the 18th century {{this is the case}} too for handsome parquet floors, which may be set off by a small Turkish rug placed in the centre of the room. At the same time, progress in the textile industry now makes it possible for companies in towns such as <b>Kidderminster</b> to produce <b>carpets</b> to cover the entire floor in the reception rooms.|$|R
50|$|Samuel Cook (1801-1893) bought Healds Hall in 1857. Samuel {{was born}} in 1801 in Sheffield in Yorkshire. His father was William Peabody Cooke who in 1795 had {{established}} a small carpet and rug making firm in Heckmondwike. He built up a successful business and in 1825 divided the firm to create separate units for the making of “Brussels” and “Kidderminster” carpets. He gave the controlling share of the “Brussels” business to his son, Samuel, who moved the undertaking to an old mill in Millbridge, Liversedge. William continued to make the <b>Kidderminster</b> rugs and <b>carpets</b> in Heckmondwike.|$|R
50|$|Ireland was succeeded at the Golden Cross by Robert Ellis and then, in the 1840s, by the {{brothers}} James and William Creech. In 1849, James Creech got into financial difficulties and, after borrowing money against {{the contents of}} the pub, all the property’s goods were seized and sold by the Sheriff of Sussex to pay Creech's creditors. Thanks to the subsequent debt collector's record, we have {{a detailed description of the}} inn's interior and furnishings in 1849. The 20-room inn offered drink, food, lodgings and recreations to gentlemen of comfortable means. On the top floor were four bedrooms, furnished with Japanned (black lacquered) and mahogany bedsteads, dressing tables, wash stands and chests of drawers; white dimity, leather-covered armchairs; and <b>Kidderminster</b> or Brussels <b>carpets.</b> On the second floor were three slightly bigger rooms, with four-poster beds. On the first floor were four comfortable sitting rooms, with open fires, velvet-covered oak chairs and mahogany tables. The third sitting room had a piano in a mahogany case. The first floor also had a ballroom (where the current theatre is). Its fittings included a mahogany board for the game of Racehorse Balls and 20 brown ware spittoons. The ground floor featured the bar, plus a parlour (with 20 iron spittoons) and a coffee room, with a writing desk. The bar featured an 18 x 3 ft counter and a spirit fountain with eight brass taps. The kitchen was well equipped, with numerous pans, fish steamers and a five-foot kitchen range.|$|R
5000|$|The modern carpet {{industry}} {{was founded in}} the area in 1785 by Brintons, and the carpet industry became extremely important to the local economy, {{so much so that the}} local newspaper is still named The Shuttle after the shuttles used on the carpet looms. [...] By 1951 there were over thirty carpet manufacturers in the town, including, for example Quayle & Tranter (now defunct) who commissioned notable artists including George Bain for their traditional designs.Aided by a 2004 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, a museum dedicated to the <b>Kidderminster</b> <b>Carpet</b> Industry was officially opened by Lord Cobham in 2012.|$|E
50|$|In 1920 Witley Court {{was sold}} by the 2nd Earl to Sir Herbert Smith, a <b>Kidderminster</b> <b>carpet</b> manufacturer. Sir Herbert {{maintained}} only a skeleton staff to manage the house whilst {{he and his family}} were away, and many areas were left unused. A major accidental fire broke out in September 1937, whilst Sir Herbert was at another of his houses. It started in the bakery situated in the basement room of the now least preserved tower. The staff tried to put the fire out with the ancient fire pump, which was connected to the fountain, but it failed to work as it had not been maintained for many years. Although only one wing of the house was gutted by the fire {{and the rest of it}} was almost intact, the insurance company declined to cover the major damage, so Sir Herbert resolved to sell the property.|$|E
