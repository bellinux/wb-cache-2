5|$|After the {{groundbreaking}} opticals of Star Wars, The Motion Pictures producers realized the film required similarly high-quality visuals. Douglas Trumbull, a film director with an excellent reputation in Hollywood {{who had worked}} on , was the first choice for director of special effects, but declined the offer. When approached, Trumbull was busy on Close Encounters, and was tired of being ignored as a director and having to churn out special effects for someone else's production; after completing the effects work, Trumbull planned on launching his own feature using a new film process. The next choice, John Dykstra, was similarly wrapped up in other projects. Post-production supervisor Paul Rabwin suggested Robert Abel's production company Robert Abel and Associates might {{be up to the}} task. The scope and size of the effects grew after the television movie became The Motion Picture. Abel and Associates bid $4million <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> film's effects and Paramount accepted. As new effects were added, Abel increased their bid by $750,000, and Roddenberry suggested that the effects costs and schedules be reexamined.|$|E

25|$|Bhakti yoga is one {{of three}} yoga taught in Bhagavad Gita. Bhakti yoga is, {{according}} to Peter Bishop, a devotee's loving devotion to a personal god as the path for spirituality.

25|$|How the {{infinite}} variety {{of plant leaves}} is generated is a subject of intense research. Some common themes have emerged. One {{of the most significant}} is the involvement of KNOX genes in generating compound leaves, as in tomato (see above). But this again is not universal. For example, pea uses a different mechanism <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same thing. Mutations in genes affecting leaf curvature can also change leaf form, by changing the leaf from flat, to a crinky shape, like the shape of cabbage leaves. There also exist different morphogen gradients in a developing leaf which define the leaf's axis. Changes in these morphogen gradients may also affect the leaf form. Another very important class of regulators of leaf development are the microRNAs, whose role in this process has just begun to be documented. The coming years should see a rapid development in comparative studies on leaf development, with many EST sequences involved in the process coming online.|$|E

25|$|Women's lack {{of access}} to higher {{education}} had effectively excluded them from the practice of well-paid and high status occupations. Entry of women into the higher professions like law and medicine was delayed in most countries due to women being denied entry to universities and qualification for degrees; for example, Cambridge University only fully validated degrees for women late in 1947, and even then only after much opposition and acrimonious debate. Women were largely limited to low-paid and poor status occupations for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, or earned less pay than men <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same work. However, through the 20th century, public perceptions of paid work shifted as the workforce increasingly moved to office jobs that do not require heavy labor, and women increasingly acquired the higher education that led to better-compensated, longer-term careers rather than lower-skilled, shorter-term jobs. Despite this, women are still at a disadvantage compared to men because of motherhood. Women are viewed as the primary caregiver to children still to this day, so their pay is lowered when they have children because businesses do not expect them to stay long after the birth.|$|E

500|$|The Cubs hired Leo Durocher {{as manager}} in 1966, hoping he could inspire renewed {{interest}} in the team's fan base. Banks hit only 15 home runs; Cubs finished the 1966 season in last place with a 59–103 win-loss record, the worst season of Durocher's career. From the time Durocher arrived in Chicago, he was frustrated at his inability to trade or bench the aging Banks. In Durocher's autobiography, he says:... was a great player in his time. Unfortunately, his time wasn't my time. Even more unfortunately, {{there was not a}} thing I could do about it. He couldn't run, he couldn't field; toward the end, he couldn't even hit.

500|$|From the {{available}} evidence, {{it was clear}} that this demolition was not carried out with the intent of collecting building stone nor for the clearance of ground for cultivation. Ashbee thought iconoclasm was likely, believing that the burial of the stones likely indicated that Christian zealots were trying to deliberately destroy and defame the pre-Christian monument. Conversely, Alexander believed that {{there was no evidence of}} iconoclasm, and instead believed that this damage resulted from a robbery. Supporting this idea is comparative evidence, with the Close Roll of 1237 ordering the opening of barrows on the Isle of Wight in search for treasure, a practice which may have spread to Kent around the same time. Alexander believed that the destruction may have been brought about by a special commissioner, highlighting that the [...] "expertness and thoroughness of the robbery" [...] would have necessitated resources beyond that which a local community could likely produce. He further suggested that the individuals responsible for damaging the monument might also have been those responsible <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same at Kit's Coty House, Coldrum long barrow, and Addington long barrow, while Ashbee suggested that the same could also be the case for Lower Kit's Coty House.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} in the development, the {{backdrop}} of Rapture had been fleshed out, but they had yet to come on how to represent the drones, protectors, and harvesters from their original game idea. The Big Daddy concept as the protector class was developed early in the process, but the team had yet to reach a satisfying design for the drones, having used several possible designs including bugs and dogs in wheelchairs. The team wanted to have the player care for the drones in some way and create pathos for these characters. The idea of using little girls came out of brainstorming, but was controversial and shocking within the team at first, recognizing that they could easily be killed and make the game more horrific in the style of Night Trap. However, as Levine worked on the story, he started to incorporate the ideas of dystopian and utopian thinkers from the twentieth century, including Ayn Rand, Aldous Huxley, and George Orwell, and considered their ideas [...] "fascinating". He brought in the ideas of Objectivism that Rand primarily outlined in the book Atlas Shrugged, that man should be driven by selfishness and not altruism, and used this to inform the philosophy behind the city of Rapture and Andrew Ryan’s work, tied in with his previous observations on Rockefeller and his writings. This was extended {{to the use of the}} little girls as drones (now Little Sisters), particularly the question whether the player should try to save the girls or harvest the ADAM for their own benefit. 2K Games expressed concern about the initial mechanic of the Little Sisters, where the player would actively prey on the Little Sister, which would have alerted a Big Daddy and setting up the fight with the player. This approach did not sit well with Levine, and 2K Games asserted that they would not ship a game [...] "where the player gets punished <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> right thing". They altered this approach where the Little Sisters would be invulnerable until the player had dealt with their Big Daddy, though LeBreton considered this [...] "a massive kludge" [...] into the game's fiction. The idea of creating the Little Sisters and presenting the player with this choice became a critical part of the game's appeal to the larger gaming market though would still be met with criticism from some outlets. Levine desired only to have one ending to the game, something that would have left the fate of the characters [...] "much more ambiguous", but publisher pressure directed them to craft multiple endings depending on the choice of harvesting Little Sisters. Levine also noted that [...] "it was never my intention to do two endings for the game. It sort of came very late and it was something that was requested by somebody up the food chain from me." ...|$|E
