2500|$|Dupas {{was again}} {{released}} from prison in February 1985. Approximately one month later, he raped a 21-year-old woman on a beach at Blairgowrie. After alighting from his car, Dupas followed the woman and attacked her, holding {{her to the ground}} at knifepoint before raping her. He later told police: [...] "I'm sorry for what happened. Everyone was telling me I'm OK now. I never thought it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again.</b> I only wanted to live a normal life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Puciato later {{commented on}} the act saying; “It was {{early in the day}} and as most people, you kind of get that out of the way early in the day but I never did. I made a point to hold onto it. And you know the turtle, the {{malicious}} turtle, was pretty easy to fire that fucker right out of the hole. There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this is never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again,</b> when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." [...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway. And then just kind of making a statement in a way that I felt would be unavoidable for people to pay attention to.” ...|$|E

6000|$|William Rodney, {{having come}} back earlier {{from the office}} than he expected, sat down {{to pick out the}} melodies in [...] "The Magic Flute" [...] upon the piano. Katharine was late, but that was nothing new, and, as she had no {{particular}} liking for music, and he felt in the mood for it, perhaps it was as well. This defect in Katharine was the more strange, William reflected, because, as a rule, the women of her family were unusually musical. Her cousin, Cassandra Otway, for example, had a very fine taste in music, and he had charming recollections of her in a light fantastic attitude, playing the flute in the morning-room at Stogdon House. He recalled with pleasure the amusing way in which her nose, long like all the Otway noses, seemed to extend itself into the flute, as if she were some inimitably graceful species of musical mole. The little picture suggested very happily her melodious and whimsical temperament. The enthusiasms of a young girl of distinguished upbringing appealed to William, and suggested a thousand ways in which, with his training and accomplishments, he could be of service to her. She ought to be given the chance of hearing good music, as it is played by those who have inherited the great tradition. Moreover, from one or two remarks let fall in the course of conversation, he thought it possible that she had what Katharine professed to lack, a passionate, if untaught, appreciation of literature. He had lent her his play. Meanwhile, as Katharine was certain to be late, and [...] "The Magic Flute" [...] is nothing without a voice, he felt inclined to spend the time of waiting in writing a letter to Cassandra, exhorting her to read Pope in preference to Dostoevsky, until her feeling for form was more highly developed. He set himself down to compose this piece of advice in a shape which was light and playful, and yet did no injury to a cause which he had near at heart, when he heard Katharine upon the stairs. A moment later it was plain that he had been mistaken, it was not Katharine; but he could not settle himself to his letter. His temper had changed from one of urbane contentment--indeed of delicious expansion--to one of uneasiness and expectation. The dinner was brought in, and had to be set by the fire to keep hot. It was now {{a quarter of an hour}} beyond the specified time. He bethought him of a piece of news which had depressed him in the earlier part of the day. Owing to the illness of one of his fellow-clerks, it was likely that he would get no holiday until later in the year, which would mean the postponement of their marriage. But this possibility, after all, was not so disagreeable as the probability which forced itself upon him with every tick of the clock that Katharine had completely forgotten her engagement. Such things had happened less frequently since Christmas, but what if they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> begin <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again?</b> What if their marriage should turn out, as she had said, a farce? He acquitted her of any wish to hurt him wantonly, but there was something in her character which made it impossible for her to help hurting people. Was she cold? Was she self-absorbed? He tried to fit her with each of these descriptions, but he had to own that she puzzled him.|$|R

At the end of the last ice age … that pump shut off and the heat transfer stopped and Europe went back into an ice age for another 900 or 1,000 years. Of course that's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again,</b> because glaciers of North America are not there. Is there any big chunk of ice anywhere near there?

5000|$|While he has {{frequently}} been disappointed by these adaptations (such as Cop), {{he was very}} complimentary of Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland's screenplay for L.A. Confidential {{at the time of}} its release. In succeeding years, however, his comments have been more reserved:L.A. Confidential, the movie, is the best thing that happened to me in my career that I had absolutely nothing to do with. It was a fluke - and a wonderful one - and it is never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again</b> - a movie of that quality.Here’s my final comment on L.A. Confidential, the movie: I go to a video store in Prairie Village, Kansas. The youngsters who work there know me as the guy who wrote L.A. Confidential. They tell all the little old ladies who come in there to get their G-rated family flick. They come up to me, they say, “OOOO… you wrote L.A. Confidential.... Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful movie. I saw it four times. You don’t see storytelling like that on the screen anymore.” ... I smile, I say, “Yes, it’s a wonderful movie, and a salutary adaptation of my wonderful novel. But listen, Granny: You love the movie. Did you go out and buy the book?” And Granny invariably says, “Well, no, I didn’t.” And I say to Granny, “Then what the fuck good are you to me?” ...|$|E
5000|$|He was {{declared}} Albanian Superliga Player of the Month by the association “Sporti na bashkon”. He {{was considered to}} be an unexpected [...] "hero" [...] with his goals, leaving behind the strikers on the team. He had been activated every game for full 90 min, never suspended, substituted or on the bench. On 10 March 2017, during the match against the rivals Skënderbeu Korçë at home, Taku was replaced {{for the first time this}} season by the coach Josa in the last minute of regular time with the score tied at 2-2. Taku, however, was not happy with the decision of missing the last few minutes, waiting by the sidelines for the game to finish. One day later, during the match analysis, Josa asked the players if any of them had anything to say, and Taku was the only one who talked, asking the coach why he was replaced, if he made a mistake. Josa replied by saying that he was not irreplaceable. Based on unverified reports, Taku answered back, which led the coach to exclude him out from dressing room. He also added that he asked the president to leave the club given how negative the situation at KF Tirana had become. Then, he was suspended for 10 days. While suspended, attempts were made by other teams in Superliga to obtain Taku, most notably by Partizani Tirana who are [...] "enemies" [...] with the [...] "White&Blues". After meeting with the club, Taku returned in training on 22 March. Taku apologized to the coach and teammates for the incident and promised that was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again.</b> Overall, Taku did not make any public comments or official announcement about what actually happened. He went on to join the Albania national team within 3 days.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto. [...] "We went to Toronto to record it, and that's when the problems started", Iommi recalled. [...] "Why Toronto? Because of the tax, really. The studio was booked through brochures because {{people thought it}} might be a good one. We got there and it had a dead sound - totally wrong. We couldn't get a real live sound. So what we had to do was rip the carpet up and try to make it as live as we could. They were okay about it, but it took time to get it exactly right. There were no other studios available." [...] In 2001 Iommi elaborated to Dan Epstein of Guitar World, [...] "I booked a studio in Toronto, and we had to find some place to rehearse. So we had this cinema that we'd go into at 10 o'clock in the morning, and it was freezing cold; it was in the heart of winter there, really awful. We'd be there, trying to write songs during the day and go and record them at night." [...] In the same article bassist Geezer Butler added, [...] "Never Say Die was a patch-up kind of an album ... People didn't realize that it was sort of tongue-in-cheek, the Never Say Die! thing. Because we knew that was it; we just knew it was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again.</b> We did this 10th anniversary tour with Van Halen in 1978, and everybody's going 'Here's to another 10 years!' And I'm going, (rolls eyes) 'Yeah, sure!'" [...] Butler was also growing impatient with Osbourne's criticism of his lyrics, telling Guitar World in 1994, [...] "I used to hate doing it towards the end of the Ozzy era. He'd say, 'I'm not singing that.' So you'd have to rethink the whole thing." [...] In the 2004 book How Black Was Our Sabbath, Iommi is quoted as saying, [...] "We were all into silly games ... and we were getting really drugged out ... We'd go down to the sessions and have to pack up because we were too stoned. Nobody could get anything right. We were all over the place. Everybody was playing a different thing." [...] "With Never Say Die!, we were down on our luck", Osbourne reflected to Spin magazine's Kory Grow. [...] "We were just a fucking bunch of guys drowning in the fucking ocean. We weren't getting along with each other and we were all fucked-up with drugs and alcohol. And I got fired. It was just a bad thing. You try to lift your head up above water, but eventually the tide sucks you under." ...|$|E
