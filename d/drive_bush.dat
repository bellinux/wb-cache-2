Some bicycle lane treatments are meant to encourage cyclists to merge with traffic before the intersection, while some treatments channelize cyclists to merge with traffic in a predetermined location. Two intersections (Bizzell/George <b>Bush</b> <b>Drive</b> and Throckmorton/George <b>Bush</b> <b>Drive)</b> at the Texas A&M University were chosen to observe cyclist behavior. Both intersection approaches contained an island separating right turning traffic from straight and left turning traffic. However, the right turn lane at Bizzell begins at the island, while at Throckmorton the right turn lane is present throughout the approach to the intersection. Video cameras were used to record cyclists as they approached and traveled into the intersections. The distance from the intersection where a cyclist merged with motor vehicle traffic, the cyclist maneuvers as they entered the intersection, and the cyclist traffic control compliance was recorded. The motor vehicle volumes were also recorded to determine if they influenced cyclists' decisions to merge with traffic. Using the Chi Square test of independence, the collected behaviors were evaluated to determine if the behaviors were dependent upon the intersection location. Linear regression was used to determine the influence of motor vehicle volumes on cyclists and the test of proportions was used to decide if the proportions of behaviors were equal at both intersections. It was found that the intersection approach geometry, striping and lane configuration does influence cyclists to merge with traffic at different locations and motor vehicle volumes did not influence cyclists' decisions to merge with traffic. The proportions of inappropriate behaviors were different between the locations, while the traffic compliance rates were the same...|$|R

Bush repeatedly invoked images of World War II in this connection, and became very emotional over Iraqi atrocities being committed in Kuwait. He also believed that failure to check Iraqi aggression would lead to more challenges to the U.S.-favored status quo and global stability. While the end of the Cold War increased U.S. security globally, it remained vulnerable to regional threats. Furthermore, Washington believed that addressing the Iraqi threat would help reassert U.S. predominance in light of growing concerns about relative decline, following the resurgence of Germany and Japan.|$|R

40|$|In much of {{the recent}} thought devoted {{to the role of}} states in {{responding}} to catastrophic public health emergencies, as most clearly evidenced by the commentary surrounding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention- sponsored Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (Model Act), there is a focus on state governments being viewed as the exclusive controlling governmental agent supervising the governmental response. Much of that thinking is premised on a view of limitations placed on Congress’ power to act in public health emergencies emanating from Commerce Clause restrictions in the Supreme Court decisions of U. S. v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995) and U. S. v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000). This state-oriented focus has tended to blind state and local emergency responders to the substantial assets that can be deployed by the federal government either as an important supplement to the state and local response; or, in appropriate circumstances and under Congressional authority, that may preempt the state response if it is deemed ineffective by the federal government. Any purported commerce clause limitations are belied by a careful reading of the Supreme Court jurisprudence in this area and the fact that Congress itself has repeatedly authorized a prominent federal role in responding to incidents of national significance through a plethora of enactments. Moreover, the Department of Homeland Security’s National Response Plan (NRP) promulgated in December 2004 in response to a Congressional directive contemplates federal leadership in responding to catastrophic public health emergencies that could override conflicting state actions. The response to Hurricane Katrina only serves to buttress this point. The widely recognized federal ineffectiveness in initially reacting to Katrina has now <b>driven</b> the <b>Bush</b> Administration to state affirmatively that the federal government must assume the leading role in response to future major disasters, including possible use of the active military either pursuant to exceptions to the Posse Commitatus Act or proposed legislation designed to amend that statute.

One thought that [...] "such a medley of fearful discords could never be called music", while another opined that [...] "we should not cry for more Mozart, Haydn or Beethoven if modern composers would all give us sheer beauty like this".

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A coordinated signal system achieves the best traffic progression when the signal plans are optimized at the correct offsets and intervals. When traffic conditions change and a transition to a new timing plan is warranted, it is important to reach the new desired offset as efficiently as possible. The timing plans are adjusted by transition methods in signal controllers to reach the new offset settings. According to Traffic Engineering, 1990, transition methods must satisfy constraints of safety, pedestrian walk time, driver expectancy, and traffic efficiency. However, the methodology for deciding on the type of transition method over another appears very little in literature. In this research, the performance of three different types of transition methods in an Eagle EPAC 300 series Controller unit were evaluated. The three transition methods tested were a Shortway Transition method, Shortway Add Only Transition method, and Infinite Dwell Transition method. The goal was to develop a methodology to determine the "best" transition method when the signal timing plans changed by an offset correction of 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 percent of the cycle length. It was based on hardware-in-the-loop simulation that was used to simulate real-time traffic flow at a coordinated signalized intersection. This real traffic signal control hardware interacts with the simulation model, CORSIM (CORridor SIMulation). The CORSIM simulation calculated the total delay of the intersection caused from the transition of timing plans for the simulation period. The test was implemented at the Wellborn Road and George <b>Bush</b> <b>Drive</b> intersection in College Station, Texas. The simulation runs were all based on a 35 -minute study period. The traffic volume remained constant at approximately 85 % capacity at the coordinated phase for the 30 minutes and at no volume for the remaining 5 minutes. The signal timing plans were fixed at a 120 -second cycle length. The transition methods for each of the offset changes were tested to find the method that resulted in the least amount of delay at the intersection. The Shortway transition method was the "best" method under these constraints for all offset corrections. The Shortway method ads time to the coordinated phase(s) or subtract time equally spread across the phase(s) to reach the new offset. The maximum amount of time that can be added or subtracted during a single cycle while the system is in transition is 18. 75 % of the cycle length. This research provides a better understanding about the transitioning methods of the Eagle EPAC 300 signal controller, responding to the change in offset. The default mode, Shortway method, performs better than the other methods when the time is subtracted from the phase(s) to reach the new offset. Ultimately, this will result in a more efficient utilization of the transition methods at signal control intersections. The signal controllers will provide less stops and delay to improve traffic efficiency. This hardware-in-the-loop methodology of evaluating the performance of transition methods is recommended for future use. The methodology is capable of testing actual signal controller transition methods in a laboratory with accurate results...|$|R
