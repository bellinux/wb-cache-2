2500|$|After Stalin's {{death from}} {{pulmonary}} edema {{brought on by}} the stroke, Beria's ambitions sprang into full force. In the uneasy silence following the cessation of Stalin's last agonies, Beria was the first to <b>dart</b> <b>forward</b> to kiss his lifeless form (a move likened by Sebag-Montefiore to [...] "wrenching a dead King's ring off his finger"). While the rest of Stalin's inner circle (even Molotov, saved from certain liquidation) stood sobbing unashamedly over the body, Beria reportedly appeared [...] "radiant", [...] "regenerated", and [...] "glistening with ill-concealed relish." [...] When Beria left the room, he broke the somber atmosphere by shouting loudly for his driver, his voice echoing with what Stalin's daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva called [...] "the ring of triumph unconcealed." [...] Alliluyeva noticed how the Politburo seemed openly frightened of Beria and unnerved by his bold display of ambition. [...] "He's off to take power," [...] Mikoyan recalled muttering to Khrushchev. That prompted a [...] "frantic" [...] dash for their own limousines to intercept him at the Kremlin.|$|E
60|$|Three {{times the}} bronco tried this trick, {{and the third}} time Dave came close to falling off. Then the bronco gave a <b>dart</b> <b>forward,</b> like an arrow from a bow.|$|E
6000|$|Immediately, {{from the}} quays, the streets, the bridges, dark figures emerged {{out of the}} {{darkness}} and hurried to the spot. Some reached the bridgehead even as Rateau made a <b>dart</b> <b>forward,</b> and two men were upon him before he succeeded in running very far. Others had scrambled down the embankment and were shouting to some unseen boatman to [...] "halt, {{in the name of the}} people!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In {{the name}} of God, no!' shrieked the widow, <b>darting</b> <b>forward.</b> 'Barnaby--my lord--see--he'll come back--Barnaby--Barnaby!' ...|$|R
60|$|Peterkin <b>darted</b> <b>forward,</b> tore open Jack's shirt at the breast, {{and laid}} his hand upon his heart.|$|R
60|$|Laverick {{took the}} bottle from the {{ice-pail}} by his side, but the sommelier <b>darted</b> <b>forward</b> and served them.|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly {{the white}} bunch {{was seen to}} <b>dart</b> <b>forward.</b> Jack, who now {{considered}} the enemy almost beyond the chance of being overtaken, gave the word, [...] "Forward!" [...] {{in the voice of}} a Stentor, following it up with [...] "Hip, hip, hurrah!" [...] and the whole host, musketeers and spearmen in a mingled mass, rushed yelling out upon the plain, and gave chase to the foe.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I were dead!" [...] was {{the startling}} {{statement}} uttered by Schultz {{talking to himself}} in the extremity of some mysterious trouble. Jasper gave him a keen glance, {{but this was not}} the time to investigate the morbid outbreak of a feverish man. He did not look as though he were actually delirious, and that for the moment must suffice. Schultz made a <b>dart</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|E
6000|$|For {{the first}} weeks, the black {{eyes of the}} child were for ever on the watch. Brangwen, good-humoured but impatient, spoiled by Tilly, was an easy blusterer. If {{for a few minutes}} he upset the {{household}} with his noisy impatience, he found at the end the child glowering at him with intense black eyes, and she was sure to <b>dart</b> <b>forward</b> her little head, like a serpent, with her biting: ...|$|E
60|$|The old man <b>darted</b> <b>forward</b> with {{surprising}} haste, and caught Harry's hand {{just as the}} finger rested upon the trigger.|$|R
60|$|To help him, she seizes a {{stick and}} is about to drop it. He <b>darts</b> <b>forward</b> and snatches it from her.|$|R
6000|$|The surgeon {{was first}} to {{discover}} him. He <b>darted</b> <b>forward</b> with a cry of recognition, [...] "Poinsett! Arthur!--what are you doing here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, my {{butterfly}} was resting, poised like a statue, on {{a pretty}} flowering plant {{that grew out}} of a cranny in the sheer wall of rock, a yard or two below the precise point where I was then sitting. Said I to myself, with an eager <b>dart</b> <b>forward,</b> [...] "I shall nab that specimen;" [...] and laying aside my pencil and drawing-pad at once, I proceeded forthwith, {{at the top of my}} speed, incontinently to nab him.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{it was the}} {{distraction}} of the boy's mind, or the potent working of his impertinence, we know not, but certain it is that his left hand slipped somehow, and a round ball, with a delicious smell, {{fell out of the}} pot. The boy half caught it, and wildly yet cleverly balanced it on the lid, but it would have rolled next moment into the sink, if Phil had not made a <b>dart</b> <b>forward,</b> caught it like a football, and bowled it back into the pot.|$|E
60|$|He hopped nearer. Was it a sweet illusion, this {{flashing}} {{fragment of}} rainbow; a beautiful vision to fade upon approach, typical {{of so much}} that is un-understandable in rook life? He made a <b>dart</b> <b>forward</b> and tapped it with his beak. No, it was real--as fine a lump of jagged green glass as any newly-married rook could desire, and to be had for the taking. SHE would be pleased with it. He was a well-meaning bird; the mere upward inclination of his tail suggested earnest though possibly ill-directed endeavour.|$|E
60|$|The {{next moment}} the {{stranger}} had <b>darted</b> <b>forward,</b> slipped his arms round the little man's legs, and toppled {{him into the}} river.|$|R
60|$|The fairy {{had nearly}} {{performed}} her part, when the arrival took place, and Rose <b>darted</b> <b>forward</b> to receive Aunt Ailie's greeting kiss.|$|R
60|$|Having {{said this}} he <b>darted</b> <b>forward,</b> forcing Paul {{to fall into}} line behind him, and I came close at the latter's heels.|$|R
6000|$|... "The avenues {{to death}} are {{numerous}} and strange. A London paper mentions the decease {{of a person}} from a singular cause. He was playing at 'puff the dart,' which is played with a long needle inserted in some worsted, and blown at a target through a tin tube. He placed the needle at {{the wrong end of}} the tube, and drawing his breath strongly to puff the <b>dart</b> <b>forward</b> with force, drew the needle into his throat. It entered the lungs, and in a few days killed him." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, the {{screaming}} had subsided, and faces {{were in a}} glow, and curls in a tangle, and Mr. Pickwick, after kissing the old lady as before mentioned, was standing under the mistletoe, looking with a very pleased countenance on all that was passing around him, when the young lady with the black eyes, after a little whispering with the other young ladies, made a sudden <b>dart</b> <b>forward,</b> and, putting her arm round Mr. Pickwick's neck, saluted him affectionately on the left cheek; and before Mr. Pickwick distinctly knew what was the matter, {{he was surrounded by}} the whole body, and kissed by every one of them.|$|E
60|$|With {{a sudden}} <b>dart</b> <b>forward,</b> I seized {{it with my}} hands, below the part that gave; then--one fierce little run back--and I brought him level with the edge. He {{clutched}} at Elsie's hand. I turned thrice round, to wind the slack about my body. The taut rope cut deep into my flesh; but nothing mattered now, except to save him. 'Catch the cloak, Elsie!' I cried; 'catch it: pull him gently in!' Elsie caught it and pulled him in, with wonderful pluck and calmness. We hauled him over the edge. He lay safe on the bank. Then we all three broke down and cried like children together. I took his hand in mine {{and held it in}} silence.|$|E
60|$|The four {{horsemen}} {{were surrounded}} by their brethren; but one of them, giving and returning blessings, <b>darted</b> <b>forward</b> to the pavilion of the great Sheikh.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought that}} again I might with my skill as a runner elude my enemies at this game, and so {{with all my}} speed <b>darted</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But <b>darting</b> <b>forward</b> {{the instant}} I had the helm, the old cook thundered on the {{forecastle}} with a handspike, [...] "Breakers! breakers close aboard!--'bout ship! 'bout ship!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then, {{with a quick}} double report, as {{of heavy}} guns, both topsails filled at once and the brig fell over swiftly on her side. Shaw was thrown headlong against the skylight, and Lingard, who had encircled the weather rail with his arm, felt the vessel under his feet <b>dart</b> <b>forward</b> smoothly, and the deck become less slanting--the speed of the brig running off a little now, easing the {{overturning}} strain of the wind upon the distended surfaces of the sails. It was only the fineness of the little vessel's lines and the perfect shape of her hull that saved the canvas, and perhaps the spars, by enabling the ready craft to get way upon herself with such lightning-like rapidity. Lingard drew a long breath and yelled jubilantly at Shaw who was struggling up against wind and rain to his commander's side.|$|E
60|$|For a minute, Frida {{thought they}} were really going to fight, and drew back in horror to await the contest. But such a warlike notion never entered the man of peace's head. He took a step {{backward}} {{for a second and}} calmly surveyed his antagonist with a critical scrutiny. Sir Lionel was short and stout and puffy; Bertram Ingledew was tall and strong and well-knit and athletic. After an instant's pause, during which the doughty baronet stood doubling his fat fists and glaring silent wrath at his lither opponent, Bertram made a sudden <b>dart</b> <b>forward,</b> seized the little stout man bodily in his stalwart arms, and lifting him like a baby, in spite of kicks and struggles, carried him a hundred paces {{to one side of the}} path, where he laid him down gingerly without unnecessary violence on a bed of young bracken. Then he returned quite calmly, as if nothing had happened, to Frida's side, with that quiet little smile on his unruffled countenance.|$|E
6000|$|His wife! He winced inwardly. A dismal {{woman with}} startled eyes and dolorously {{drooping}} mouth, that {{would listen to}} him in pained wonder and mute stillness. She was used to those night-discourses now. She had rebelled once--at the beginning. Only once. Now, while he sprawled in the long chair and drank and talked, she would stand at the further end of the table, her hands resting on the edge, her frightened eyes watching his lips, without a sound, without a stir, hardly breathing, till he dismissed her with a contemptuous: [...] "Go to bed, dummy." [...] She would draw a long breath then and trail out of the room, relieved but unmoved. Nothing could startle her, make her scold or make her cry. She did not complain, she did not rebel. That first difference of theirs was decisive. Too decisive, thought Willems, discontentedly. It had frightened the soul out of her body apparently. A dismal woman! A damn'd business altogether! What the devil {{did he want to}} go and saddle himself. [...] . Ah! Well! he wanted a home, and the match seemed to please Hudig, and Hudig gave him the bungalow, that flower-bowered house to which he was wending his way in the cool moonlight. And he had the worship of the Da Souza tribe. A man of his stamp could carry off anything, do anything, aspire to anything. In another five years those white people who attended the Sunday card-parties of the Governor would accept him--half-caste wife and all! Hooray! He saw his shadow <b>dart</b> <b>forward</b> and wave a hat, as big as a rum barrel, {{at the end of an}} arm several yards long. [...] . Who shouted hooray? [...] . He smiled shamefacedly to himself, and, pushing his hands deep into his pockets, walked faster with a suddenly grave face. Behind him--to the left--a cigar end glowed in the gateway of Mr. Vinck's front yard. Leaning against one of the brick pillars, Mr. Vinck, the cashier of Hudig & Co., smoked the last cheroot of the evening. Amongst the shadows of the trimmed bushes Mrs. Vinck crunched slowly, with measured steps, the gravel of the circular path before the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{he seems}} to be getting about as much as he wants," [...] Walter replied, grimly, as he <b>darted</b> <b>forward</b> to assist Sewatis in case it should become necessary.|$|R
60|$|The crab <b>darted</b> <b>forward,</b> and in {{the next}} instant the great teeth of her pincers were {{fastened}} with a tremendous grip upon the rudder and rudder-post of the Scarabaeus.|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} of its weakly gambols the terrier chanced to {{discover}} a dead fish on the sands. Instantly it <b>darted</b> <b>forward</b> and began to devour it with great voracity.|$|R
5000|$|Like other woodpeckers, {{this species}} has a {{straight}} pointed bill, a stiff tail {{to provide support}} against tree trunks, and zygodactyl or “yoked" [...] feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. The long tongue can <b>dart</b> <b>forward</b> to capture insects.|$|E
50|$|Following the Second Battle of El Alamein a {{plan was}} put forth {{to use the}} remains of the {{division}} as a self-contained pursuit force to <b>dart</b> <b>forward</b> into the German-Italian rear as far as possibly Tobruk; however the plan to use the division was shelved and units in the forward area were used instead.|$|E
50|$|With {{exception}} for the benthic species Spadella, arrow worms are all adapted for planktonic existence. They swim {{to the surface}} at night, and descend during daytime. Most {{of the time they}} drift passively, but they can <b>dart</b> <b>forward</b> in swift spurts, using their caudal fin and longitudinal muscles. Horizontal fins bordering the trunk serve largely as stabilizers, and are used in flotation rather than in active swimming.|$|E
60|$|Thus apostrophised, brother Ned, who {{had entered}} with Mrs Nickleby, {{and who had}} been before unobserved by the young men, <b>darted</b> <b>forward,</b> and fairly hugged brother Charles in his arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha, {{my little}} heart of gold!" [...] he cried, <b>darting</b> <b>forward</b> {{suddenly}} and throwing his arms round Sir Nigel. [...] "I {{heard that you}} were here and have been seeking you." ...|$|R
60|$|Shaggy had <b>darted</b> <b>forward,</b> {{and embraced}} his newly found brother with both his arms. The brother also embraced Shaggy, who then led him forward and {{introduced}} him to all the assembled company.|$|R
