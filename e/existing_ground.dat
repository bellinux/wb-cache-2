25|$|In 1847 {{a bowling}} club started {{playing on the}} Smirthwaite Street green. A year later Wakefield Cricket Club was formed to play on Grove Hall grounds – which {{neighbour}} the <b>existing</b> <b>ground.</b> A new club was formed under the title of Wakefield Cricket and Bowling Club.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not long}} before the club was forced out again, this time because of the {{expansion}} of the railway. The South Melbourne ground was in the path of Victoria’s first steam railway line from Melbourne to Sandridge (now Port Melbourne). Governor La Trobe offered the MCC a choice of three sites; an area adjacent to the <b>existing</b> <b>ground,</b> a site at the junction of Flinders and Spring Streets or a ten-acre (about 4hectares) section of the Government Paddock at Richmond next to Richmond Park.|$|E

25|$|One {{obstacle}} that {{conventional and}} hybrid airships face is {{their inability to}} control buoyancy without venting helium. Another operational challenge faced by airships and hybrid airships is the inability to control or adjust static lift during operations. Traditional airships' requirement for external ballast exchange and <b>existing</b> <b>ground</b> infrastructure has significantly limited their cargo utility. Once the cargo is off-loaded, traditional helium-dependent airships become extremely light, and this static lift causes them to float away. To combat these forces, they require external ballast exchange, using rocks, ice, water, or lead bags, to keep the airship anchored to the ground.|$|E
25|$|A new plan, {{based on}} {{wholesale}} redevelopment of the <b>existing</b> <b>ground,</b> {{was announced in}} 2000 {{which at the time}} would cost an estimated £9m. The stadium would be built in two phases, with the first phase seeing the complete redevelopment of the Devonport End, Lyndhurst Stand, and Barn Park End. The second phase involved the Mayflower Grandstand which would be replaced by a new three-tiered structure to complete an 18,500 capacity all-seater bowl. The green light came in June 2001 when the club and Plymouth City Council agreed a new long-term lease for the ground. The building firm Barr Construction moved onto the site two months later.|$|E
500|$|The {{route is}} {{constructed}} as a , two lane single carriageway with [...] hardstrips and a [...] verge, with a [...] speed limit. The road has some sections on low embankment {{and others in}} shallow cutting where it runs close to existing residential properties, but is mostly close to <b>existing</b> <b>ground</b> level. Surface drainage is collected by a kerb and gully system and discharged into four new attenuation ponds. The route is only lit where there are specific safety reasons for doing so, such as at junctions and crossings along the route. There are no footways along the route other than specific pedestrian crossing points.|$|E
50|$|The 1990s saw {{the closure}} {{of some of the}} oldest {{football}} stadiums in England, including Middlesbrough's Ayresome Park and Sunderland's Roker Park, in favour of new sites which were more suitable for all-seater capacities that would have been practically impossible {{on the site of the}} <b>existing</b> <b>grounds.</b>|$|R

500|$|In November 1999, Arsenal {{examined}} {{the feasibility of}} building a new stadium in Ashburton Grove. Anthony Spencer, estate agent and club property adviser, recommended the area to director Danny Fiszman and vice-chairman David Dein having scoured over North London for potential areas. The land, [...] from Highbury was composed of a rubbish processing plant and industrial estate, 80% owned by the Islington Council, Railtrack and Sainsbury's. After passing the first significant milestone at Islington Council's planning committee, Arsenal submitted a planning application for a new-build 60,000 seater stadium in November 2000. This included a redevelopment project at Drayton Park, converting the <b>existing</b> <b>ground</b> Highbury to flats and building a new waste station in Lough Road. As part of the scheme, Arsenal intended to create 1,800 new jobs for the community and 2,300 new homes. Improvements to three railway stations, Holloway Road, Drayton Park and Finsbury Park, were included {{to cope with the}} increased capacity requirements from matchday crowds.|$|E
500|$|The line {{began on}} the east side of {{downtown}} Cincinnati, at the corner of Eggleston Avenue and Court Street. The site of the brick freight depot, closed in 1969 and demolished in 1975, is now owned by Greyhound Lines, which uses it as an intercity bus terminal. A track built in 1887 crossed Court Street, connecting with the Little Miami Railroad's Eggleston Avenue Connection for freight transfer. The line began by climbing the Deer Creek Valley, the only feasible rail entrance to downtown Cincinnati that did not follow a river valley. When the railroad was built in the late 1870s, the valley was used by the city as a dump. An 1852 city ordinance provided for raising the ground level, beginning with the raising of Court Street by as much as [...] To follow the eventual surface level and avoid the steep hillsides, the railroad was built on trestles for much of its ascent, with a maximum grade of 3.5%. After leaving the depot, the line traversed an S-shaped trestle to the east side of the valley, before crossing Elsinore Place and Eden Park Drive at grade, with a second trestle between these streets. (The former was replaced in January 1889 with a straighter single-track trestle.) A bridge took the line over Florence Avenue, and it then passed through the neighborhood of Mount Auburn before passing under the summit through the cut-and-cover Oak Street Tunnel north of McMillan Street. The line started its gradual descent as it left the tunnel, generally following the <b>existing</b> <b>ground</b> level and crossing streets at grade.|$|E
2500|$|The one {{chosen for}} the new ground was a large [...] site with good quality soil for a cricket square located some two miles (3km) away from the <b>existing</b> <b>ground.</b> Carmel proudly began their first season at their new Pen-y-Gelli ground in 1991 and Conwy CC {{provided}} the opponents in the inaugural match. Backed by ambitious club secretary Stan Taylor Carmel continued to develop their facilities at the ground and in July 1998 former England cricket international Tom Cartwright and Mrs Dorothy Taylor opened the new pavilion.|$|E

2500|$|Hanoi {{with its}} more than 6 million {{inhabitants}} receives 80% of its water from groundwater. Groundwater is polluted by ammonium with a concentration that is 5 to 10 times (7–20mg/l) higher than the allowed standard. Surface water comes from the Gia Lam plant completed in 1994 [...] and the Thang Long North-Van Tri plant completed in 2004, both financed by Japanese development assistance. It is planned that surface water from the Da River, the Red River and the Duong River will satisfy the growing water demand {{in the future and}} gradually replace the <b>existing</b> <b>ground</b> water. During the dry season in 2013 several districts of Hanoi went completely without water. A transmission pipeline from the existing plant on the Da River suffered numerous breaks, exacerbating water scarcity. The Vietnamese company Vinaconex built the pipeline with fibreglass-reinforced pipes that it manufactured itself using. With anti-Chinese sentiment riding high in Vietnam, the faults have been blamed on the perceived low-cost Chinese technology behind the manufacturing process.

2500|$|In early 2007, a developer, {{proposed}} {{the construction of}} a 37 story market-rate condominium skyscraper at 1439 Alice Street, directly {{across the street from the}} Malonga Casquelord Arts Center, and adjacent to the three story 1920's Cliff Apartments. The building would be one of the tallest in Oakland, second only to the Ordway Building in the neighboring Downtown district. The building would be built on a parcel that currently features a combined two story parking garage and retail shop space with an active, longtime retail tenant. The project would maintain the current parking garage facade, with its existing design for the first two levels, with a modern, angular glass tower springing out of the top, and rising to a height of [...] [...] Though the developer did propose a ground floor wine bar/cold food cafe space for a small portion of the first floor, he proposed an overall reduction in the square footage of the <b>existing</b> <b>ground</b> floor retail space and a substantial square footage for the proposed building resident lobby, and elimination of a current first floor exterior retail space entrance. The developer also proposed a mid-building [...] "wellness center"/"personal services" [...] commercial space. Depending upon a final zoning designation and the planning process however, this commercial space could also be used as medical or professional office or an inclusive, approachable space with a neighborhood-serving retail tenant. Supporters of the Arts Center had concerns that those would move into the building could eventually have a reverse sensitivity to the music and drumming across the street.|$|E
