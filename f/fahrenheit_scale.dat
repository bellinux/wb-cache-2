25|$|In the United States, the <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scale</b> {{is widely}} used. On this scale the {{freezing}} point of water corresponds to 32°F and {{the boiling point}} to 212°F. The Rankine scale, still used in fields of chemical engineering in the U.S., is an absolute scale based on the Fahrenheit increment.|$|E
25|$|The lowest {{theoretical}} {{temperature is}} absolute zero, {{at which the}} thermal motion of all fundamental particles in matter reaches a minimum. Although classically described as motionless, particles still possess a finite zero-point energy in the quantum mechanical description. Absolute zero is denoted as 0K on the Kelvin scale, −273.15°C on the Celsius scale, and −459.67°F on the <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E
25|$|Temperature is a {{physical}} quantity expressing the subjective perceptions of hot and cold. Temperature is measured with a thermometer, historically calibrated in various temperature scales and units of measurement. The most commonly used scales are the Celsius scale, denoted in °C (informally, degrees centigrade), the <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scale</b> (°F), and the Kelvin scale. The kelvin (K) is the unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI), in which temperature {{is one of the}} seven fundamental base units.|$|E
5000|$|In colloquial usage, [...] "negative temperature" [...] may {{refer to}} {{temperatures}} that are expressed as negative {{numbers on the}} more familiar Celsius or <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scales,</b> with values that are colder than the zero points of those scales but still warmer than absolute zero.|$|R
25|$|Temperature {{measurement}} using modern scientific thermometers {{and temperature}} scales goes {{back at least}} as far as the early 18th century, when Gabriel Fahrenheit adapted a thermometer (switching to mercury) and a scale both developed by Ole Christensen Rømer. <b>Fahrenheit's</b> <b>scale</b> is still in use in the United States for non-scientific applications.|$|R
50|$|The {{properties}} of water {{have historically been}} used to define various temperature scales. Notably, the Kelvin, Celsius, Rankine, and <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scales</b> were, or currently are, defined by the freezing and boiling points of water. The less common scales of Delisle, Newton, Réaumur and Rømer were defined similarly. The triple point of water is a more commonly used standard point today.|$|R
25|$|Two of the {{earliest}} such units of measure to come into use were the horsepower and the degree Fahrenheit. The horsepower was defined by James Watt in 1782 as the power required to raise 33,000 pounds of water through a height of one foot in one minute and the degree Fahrenheit was first defined by Daniel Fahrenheit in about 1713 as being a temperature scale having its lower calibration point (0°F) at temperature where a supersaturated salt/ice mixture froze and its upper calibration point at body temperature (96°F). In 1777 the Royal Society, under the chairmanship of Henry Cavendish, proposed {{the definition of the}} <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scale</b> be modified such that the temperature corresponding to the melting point of ice be 32°F and the boiling point of water under standard atmospheric conditions be 212°F.|$|E
25|$|After getting only 2 {{points on}} draws {{in the first}} two games of the four-game homestand, United was desperate for a win when Portland Timbers came to town. The start of the game was delayed an hour because of record-setting heat that {{exceeded}} 100 degrees (on the <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scale),</b> but United got off to a hot start themselves. An early corner was headed on by Boswell to Birnbaum, who took his chance on a sharp volley to give D.C. an early lead. The team doubled that lead in the 29th minute, just before a scheduled heat break, when Acosta finished a chance in front of goal, set up by a nifty chipped pass from Mullins. Thanks to the usual heroics by Hamid, the team held on for a 2-0 shutout win that lifted United ahead of New England and at least temporarily holding the sixth and final postseason spot in the East.|$|E
25|$|Large, {{explosive}} {{volcanic eruptions}} inject water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF) and ash (pulverized rock and pumice) {{into the stratosphere}} to heights of 16–32 kilometres (10–20nbsp&mi) above the Earth's surface. The most significant impacts from these injections come from the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which condenses rapidly in the stratosphere to form fine sulfate aerosols. The SO2 emissions alone of two different eruptions are sufficient to compare their potential climatic impact. The aerosols increase the Earth's albedo—its reflection of radiation from the Sun back into space—and thus cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the stratosphere. Several eruptions during the past century have caused {{a decline in the}} average temperature at the Earth's surface of up to half a degree (<b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scale)</b> for periods of one to three years; sulfur dioxide from the eruption of Huaynaputina probably caused the Russian famine of 1601–1603.|$|E
50|$|The Rankine {{temperature}} scale {{was based upon}} the <b>Fahrenheit</b> temperature <b>scale,</b> with its zero representing absolute zero instead.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after this}} sad event the winter began to exhibit unwonted signs of severity. It had begun earlier, and {{continued}} later than usual. The snow averaged three feet {{deep in the}} plains and four feet in the woods, and the cold was intense, being frequently down to forty-five degrees below zero of <b>Fahrenheit's</b> <b>scale,</b> while the ice measured between five and six feet in thickness on the rivers.|$|R
60|$|The cold {{experienced}} by these navigators {{of the northern}} seas is terribly intense. Their thermometers have frequently indicated a temperature as low as 75 degrees below zero, or 107 degrees of frost, on <b>Fahrenheit's</b> <b>scale.</b> The thermometers of arctic explorers are always filled with spirits of wine, as quicksilver freezes at about 40 degrees below zero, and is therefore unsuitable. It would be frozen, indeed, {{the greater part of}} the winter.|$|R

2500|$|Absolute zero is {{the lower}} {{limit of the}} {{thermodynamic}} temperature scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reaches its minimum value, taken as 0. Absolute zero is {{the point at which}} the fundamental particles of nature have minimal vibrational motion, retaining only quantum mechanical, zero-point energy-induced particle motion. [...] The theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law; by international agreement, absolute zero is taken as −273.15° on the Celsius scale (International System of Units), which equates to −459.67° on the <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scale</b> (United States customary units or Imperial units). The corresponding Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition.|$|E
2500|$|Temperature is {{measured}} with thermometers {{that may be}} calibrated {{to a variety of}} temperature scales. In most of the world (except for Belize, Myanmar, Liberia and the United States), the Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. Most scientists measure temperature using the Celsius scale and thermodynamic temperature using the Kelvin scale, which is the Celsius scale offset so that its null point is [...] = , or absolute zero. Many engineering fields in the U.S., notably high-tech and US federal specifications (civil and military), also use the Kelvin and Celsius scales. Other engineering fields in the U.S. also rely upon the Rankine scale (a shifted <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scale)</b> when working in thermodynamic-related disciplines such as combustion.|$|E
60|$|It is {{well known}} that when fresh water becomes so cold that its {{temperature}} is 32 degrees of <b>Fahrenheit's</b> <b>scale,</b> it loses its liquid form and becomes ice. A somewhat lower temperature than this is necessary to freeze salt water; the reason being, that greater force is required to expel the salt which the sea holds in solution,--which salt is always more or less expelled in the process of freezing.|$|R

50|$|A {{negative}} number {{is a real}} number that is less than zero. Such numbers are often used to represent the amount of a loss or absence. For example, a debt that is owed may {{be thought of as}} a negative asset, or a decrease in some quantity may {{be thought of as a}} negative increase. Negative numbers are used to describe values on a scale that goes below zero, such as the Celsius and <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scales</b> for temperature.|$|R
2500|$|The Kelvin {{scale is}} called {{absolute}} for two reasons. One is Kelvin's, that its formal character {{is independent of}} the properties of particular materials. The other reason is that its zero is in a sense absolute, in that it indicates absence of microscopic classical motion of the constituent particles of matter, so {{that they have a}} limiting specific heat of zero for zero temperature, according to the third law of thermodynamics. Nevertheless, a Kelvin temperature does in fact have a definite numerical value that has been arbitrarily chosen by tradition and is dependent on the property of a particular materials; it is simply less arbitrary than relative [...] "degrees" [...] scales such as Celsius and Fahrenheit. [...] Being an absolute scale with one fixed point (zero), there is only one degree of freedom left to arbitrary choice, rather than two as in relative scales. For the Kelvin scale in modern times, this choice of convention is made to be that of setting the gas–liquid–solid triple point of water, a point which can be reliably reproduced as a standard experimental phenomenon, at a numerical value of 273.16 kelvins. The Kelvin scale is also called the thermodynamic scale. However, to demonstrate that its numerical value is indeed arbitrary, it is useful to point out that an alternate, less widely used absolute temperature scale exists called the Rankine scale, made to be aligned with the <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scale</b> as Kelvin is with Celsius.|$|E

50|$|The {{inventor}} of the <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scale</b> Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit learned of Rømer's work and visited him in 1708; {{in one of his}} letters Fahrenheit narrates how he borrowed the idea for the scale from this visit, increasing the number of divisions and eventually establishing what is now known as the <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scale,</b> in 1724.|$|E

But they may {{appreciate}} the situation in some degree when I tell them that on that occasion I suddenly found myself about twenty miles from home, fatigued, hungry, with the night descending over the wilderness, the thermometer about thirty-five below zero, of <b>Fahrenheit's</b> <b>scale,</b> with the snow for my bed, and without that all important flint, steel and tinder, wherewith to procure fire for the cooking of my food and the warming of my frame! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{period of}} flight was {{an hour and}} three-quarters, which, for those {{early days of the}} art, was a pretty long voyage. By {{throwing}} over ballast the voyagers ascended, and by letting off gas they descended at pleasure; and they observed that during an hour, while they were exposed to the sun's rays, the gas was heated up to the temperature of fifty-five degrees of <b>Fahrenheit's</b> <b>scale,</b> which had the effect of sensibly increasing the buoyancy of the balloon. They descended safely on the meadow of Nesle, about twenty-five miles from Paris.|$|R

25|$|Temperatures {{that are}} {{expressed}} as negative {{numbers on the}} familiar Celsius or <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scales</b> are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain systems can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their thermodynamic temperature (expressed in kelvins) can be of a negative quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than any system with a positive temperature, {{in the sense that}} if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the negative to the positive-temperature system.|$|R

5000|$|Due to thermal expansion, {{precision}} length measurements {{need to be}} made at (or converted to) a defined temperature. ISO 1 helps in comparing measurements by defining such a reference temperature.

[...] It soon replaced worldwide other reference temperatures for length measurements that manufacturers of precision equipment had used before, including 0 °C, 62 °F, and 25 °C. Among the reasons for choosing 20 °C was that this was a comfortable and practical workshop temperature and that it resulted in an integer value on both the Celsius and <b>Fahrenheit</b> <b>scales.</b>|$|R
