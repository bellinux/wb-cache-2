25|$|In the 1950s, {{most people}} {{diagnosed}} with SLE lived {{fewer than five}} years. Today, over 90% now survive {{for more than ten}} years, and many live relatively symptom-free. 80–90% can <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> a normal lifespan.|$|E
25|$|Persistent {{hypertension}} {{is one of}} {{the risk}} factors for strokes, heart attacks, heart failure and arterial aneurysms, and {{is the leading cause of}} chronic kidney failure. Even moderate elevation of arterial pressure leads to shortened life expectancy. At severely high pressures, mean arterial pressures 50% or more above average, a person can <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> no more than a few years unless appropriately treated.|$|E
25|$|The Preston curve {{indicates}} that individuals born in richer countries, on average, can <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> longer than those born in poor countries. However, {{the link between}} income and life expectancy flattens out. This means that at low levels of per capita income, further increases in income are associated with large gains in life expectancy, but at high levels of income, increased income has little associated change in life expectancy. In other words, if the relationship is interpreted as being causal, then there are diminishing returns to income in terms of life expectancy.|$|E

25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} may be self-limiting, frequently recurring, chronic or progressive. Most {{patients have}} severe symptoms lasting {{a few weeks}} to six months. 15 to 50 percent of cases involve recurrent bouts of arthritis. Chronic arthritis or sacroiliitis occurs in 15–30 percent of cases. Repeated attacks over many years are common, and patients sometimes end up with chronic and disabling arthritis, heart disease, amyloid deposits, ankylosing spondylitis, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, cardiac conduction abnormalities, or aortitis with aortic regurgitation. However, most people with reactive arthritis can <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> normal life spans and maintain a near-normal lifestyle with modest adaptations to protect the involved organs.|$|E
25|$|For myself, I am now in my 63rd year, yet my {{constitution}} is not seriously impaired, {{as you may}} conclude when I mention that I still am able to skate, to play at cricket occasionally with my sons, and that last year I rowed with them upon the Tay, a distance of eight miles, as stroke of a Four-oar? Nor when I think of others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised. It is true we used to be told, even in those days, that no man in a Racing-Boat could <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> to the age of thirty.|$|E
25|$|There {{are serious}} and {{controversial}} issues about {{differences in the}} situation of women with different races and ethnicities in Brazil. As a whole, black and Amerindian women enjoy considerably less quality of life than white women, with this being {{a reflection of the}} general characteristics of the social and economic gap that has separated social classes in Brazil for centuries, thus not indicating any specific problem about gender and women's rights. Black women's life expectancy in 2004 was 69.52 years, while white women could <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> 73.80 on average. However, there is, at least apparently, no legal or institutional circumstance that generates those ethnic differences, but lower standards of life have always been related to a much larger percentage of mulatto, black and Amerindian people in Brazil, as in many other countries. In the last years, there is a tendency of soft decrease in Brazil's racial inequality.|$|E

500|$|On March 24, 2012, Cheney {{underwent}} a seven-hour heart transplant procedure at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia, {{at the age}} of 71. [...] He had been on a waiting list for more than 20 months before receiving the heart from an anonymous donor. Cheney's principal cardiologist, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, advised his patient that [...] "it would not be unreasonable for an otherwise healthy 71-year-old man to <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> another 10 years" [...] with a transplant, saying in a family-authorized interview that he considered Cheney to be otherwise healthy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} assess the quality of these {{additional}} years of life, 'healthy life expectancy' has been calculated for the last 30 years. Since 2001, the World Health Organization has published statistics called Healthy life expectancy (HALE), defined as {{the average number of}} years that a person can <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in [...] "full health" [...] excluding the years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury. Since 2004, Eurostat publishes annual statistics called Healthy Life Years (HLY) based on reported activity limitations. The United States uses similar indicators in the framework of the national health promotion and disease prevention plan [...] "Healthy People 2010". More and more countries are using health expectancy indicators to monitor the health of their population.|$|E
2500|$|More {{detailed}} {{versions of}} the story largely alleged that Zhang Heng personally killed Emperor Wen by pounding his chest and breaking his ribs. [...] The advocates for the theory that Emperor Wen was killed on Emperor Yang's orders also pointed to other circumstantial evidence, including how immediately after Emperor Wen's death Emperor Yang took Consorts Chen and Cai as his concubines. [...] Further, after Zhang lost Emperor Yang's favors and eventually was executed in 612, Zhang lamented at the execution field, [...] "What did I do for him that I can <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> long?" [...] The warden, apparently believing in the murder theory himself, immediately covered his ears to avoid hearing any details and had Zhang immediately executed. [...] They further pointed out how Liu Shu and Yuan Yan were exiled and Yang Yong executed immediately following Emperor Wen's death.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2005, Japanese news sources {{reported}} that Ichigo had attempted suicide in her Tokyo apartment. According to the sources, on July 13, 2005, {{she tried to}} commit suicide by taking 20 sleeping pills and then slashing her wrists. A suicide note said it was due to Shintaro Yoshitake (...) [...] Yoshitake was a relief pitcher for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks baseball team with whom Ichigo was having an affair. Ichigo had only known Yoshitake (who was married) for a short time but had developed a deep attachment for him and became despondent when he broke off their relationship. Ichigo was taken to the hospital by police, who had been alerted by Ichigo's mother who was worried by her daughter's hints about suicide. Ichigo appeared soon afterwards in a magazine photo showing her scarred wrist. As an aside, in an interview years before, Ichigo had declared jokingly that she did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> past 24 - her age {{at the time of her}} suicide attempt.|$|E
2500|$|Xiahou Dun's subordinate, Han Hao, led his men {{to outside}} Xiahou's camp, where he gave orders for the other {{officers}} to remain in their respective camps and not make any move. The situation in the other camps became stable. He then headed towards Xiahou Dun's tent and shouted at the hostage-takers, [...] "You murderous traitors, how dare you take the commander hostage! Do you still <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>live?</b> I've received orders to attack the enemy, so I won't let you have your way {{just for the sake}} of one officer." [...] With tears in his eyes, he told Xiahou Dun, [...] "This is the law. I've to follow it." [...] Han Hao then ordered {{his men to}} attack the hostage-takers, who were shocked by his response and immediately gave up. The hostage-takers kowtowed and begged for their lives, [...] "We only want to obtain some money for our use and we'll leave after that." [...] Han Hao reprimanded them sternly and had them all executed. Xiahou Dun was saved.|$|E
2500|$|Native (or [...] "pani", a {{corruption}} of Pawnee) slaves were {{much easier to}} obtain and thus more numerous than African slaves in New France, but were less valued. The average native slave died at 18, and the average African slave died at 25 (the average European could <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> {{until the age of}} 35). By 1790 the abolition movement was gaining ground in Canada and the ill intent of slavery was evidenced by an incident involving a slave woman being violently abused by her slave owner on her way to being sold in the United States. The Act Against Slavery of 1793 legislated the gradual abolition of slavery: no slaves could be imported; slaves already in the province would remain enslaved until death, no new slaves could be brought into Upper Canada, and children born to female slaves would be slaves but must be freed at age 25. The Act remained in force until 1833 when the British Parliament's Slavery Abolition Act finally abolished slavery {{in all parts of the}} British Empire. Historian Marcel Trudel has documented 4,092 recorded slaves throughout Canadian history, of which 2,692 were Aboriginal people, owned by the French, and 1,400 blacks owned by the British, together owned by approximately 1,400 masters. Trudel also noted 31 marriages took place between French colonists and Aboriginal slaves.|$|E
