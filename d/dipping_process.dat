50|$|Dipping {{consists}} of simply immersing the wood in a bath of creosote or other preservative {{for a few}} seconds or minutes. Similar penetrations to that of brushing and spraying processes are achieved. It has the advantage of minimizing hand labor. It requires more equipment and larger quantities of preservative and is not adequate for treating small lots of timber. Usually the <b>dipping</b> <b>process</b> is useful in the treatment of window sashes and doors. Treatment with copper salt preservatives is no longer allowed with this method.|$|E

An electrostatic charging medium is placed inside the bed so that the powder material becomes charged as the fluidizing air lifts it up. Charged particles of powder move upward and form a cloud of charged powder above the fluid bed.

50|$|During the mid 19th century {{operators}} {{connected to}} the booming waste-generated fertilizer (night soil) business circulated cities and towns emptying vaults. In rural areas where vaults are usually much smaller and shallower farmers and other property owners often conducted this task themselves. Despite lying in human waste and other decaying refuse for years, many recyclable bottles of the time, and other reusable items, were retrieved during the <b>dipping</b> <b>process.</b> Genuine garbage would be taken to landfills and other suitable locations and dumped, along with a never ending supply of stove and fireplace ashes.|$|E
50|$|Ripening {{of fruits}} is not simultaneous. Several harvests are necessary. In climates with little annual variation, tamarillo trees can flower and set fruit {{throughout}} the year. In climates with pronounced seasons (such as New Zealand), fruits ripen in autumn. Premature harvest and ethylene induced ripening in controlled-atmosphere chambers is possible with minimal loss of fruit quality. The fragile lateral branches can break easily when loaded with fruits, so premature harvest helps to reduce this risk and allows storage of fruits up to 20 days at room temperature. A cold-water <b>dipping</b> <b>process,</b> {{developed by the}} New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research also allows further storage of 6-10 weeks.|$|E

40|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry’s move to pure-tin finishes {{is creating}} a dilemma for the high-reliability community. Most military and aerospace companies forbid the use of pure-tin {{because of the risk}} of tin whiskers. To resolve this dilemma, hot solder dip is being implemented to convert components to alternative finishes. However, poorly designed solder dip temperature profiles can induce severe thermal gradients within components, which can cause acute and/or latent defects. This paper addresses the thermodynamic aspects of the solder <b>dip</b> <b>process</b> and provides solutions for minimizing these thermal gradients. The temperature distribution in a component was modeled using finite element analysis during three different solder <b>dip</b> <b>processes.</b> It was determined that differential temperatures were minimized when profiles with gradual preheat and gradual cool down were utilized. In addition, the model was verified by experimental results, which demonstrated a good correlation between simulated and actual measurements.

50|$|Aluminized steel can be {{made using}} a variety of processes, cladding, hot dipping, {{galvanic}} coating, metallizing, and calorizing, but the most effective process is hot dipping. The process of hot dipping starts by cleaning the steel, then placing the steel in a bath of Al-11%Si at a temperature of 988K and shaken, then pulled out and air dried. The aluminium diffuses into the steel, creating an intermetallic layer above the steel base layer, but below the outside aluminum coating. The aluminium coating is oxidized to help protect the inner steel from corrosion and further aluminium diffusion. The silicon is added to the aluminium bath to create a thinner layer of aluminium on the steel. The hot <b>dipping</b> <b>process</b> is cheaper and more effective to produce aluminized steel than any other process.|$|E
50|$|Hunter Boot Ltd {{enjoyed a}} record season in summer 2007 announcing, in August, an 85% sales {{increase}} against {{the same period}} in 2006 Despite this, Hunter remained faced with major financial challenges regarding production. High manufacturing and fuel costs that contributed to the company's move into administration in 2006 remained prominent and, like many UK manufacturing businesses, Hunter was forced to consider whether it was commercially viable to keep making boots in the UK. The company also had to negotiate a volatile relationship with its landlord and an expensive and inefficient 96-year-old factory. Eventually, alternative supply sources were sought and developed in Europe and the Far East and plans were made to exit the Dumfries plant and relocate the company HQ to Edinburgh. This move was finally made in September 2008. The Chinese made gumboots are visually similar to the original Scottish made gumboots apart from the addition of an internal seam. Some manufacturing efficiencies have also been made including the removal of the latex <b>dipping</b> <b>process,</b> making the boots virtually identical to those from many other manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{workpiece}} travels down {{a conveyor}} belt towards a paint booth, or paint tank, where it is sprayed with, or dipped into, electrostatically charged paint particles. Integrated into a powder paint booth is a powder recovery unit, which recovers between 95% and 100% of the paint over-spray coatings. After the workpiece is coated, it continues on the conveyor belt to an oven, where the paint is cured. The benefits {{to the process of}} electrostatic coating is the ability to recover the little over-spray and having the process automated which will cut costs. The reason for the little over spray is the paint particles that do not hit the piece will turn in the air {{and go back to the}} piece. There are also some drawbacks to the process: everything in the area of the coating must be grounded to prevent static buildup and can easily arc, damaging the hanging devices and/or the locations where the hanging devices rest on the conveyor. All hangers, conveyors, etc. must be cleaned often to ensure a good ground and prevent anyone in the area from getting a severe shock. In an airborne system, any recesses on the piece that is being coated can be missed because the electrostatic paint is more attracted to corners and sharp edges; this means that another process for coating can be a better option if the piece has recesses. In the <b>dipping</b> <b>process,</b> air entrapment can occur in blind holes and deep recesses, so the positioning of the part as it enters the paint tank is critical in removing any trapped air that will restrict paint coverage.|$|E

40|$|Hardwood lumber drying in the South {{is subject}} to hot and humid weather that {{promotes}} enzymatic stain in sapwood. Research has long studied the problem and certain remedies have been proposed. Chemical dipping is {{the most commonly used}} method of preventing enzymatic stain. However, its application is only topical and does not prevent stain. A private operator, Danny Elder of Jasper, Texas, developed, through trial and error, a pre-drying treatment method called the Elder Process. The claimed benefits of the Elder Process include prevention of enzymatic stain; darkening sapwood color which more closely match that of heartwood and increases color consistency of lumber; reduce drying degrade; and reduction in air drying time.
