Later, Nuthall explored the Indian Territory (Oklahoma), the Oregon Trail, and even Hawaii. His book A Journal of Travels into the Arkansas Territory {{was an important}} account of frontier life. Although Nuthall was the most traveled Western naturalist before 1840, unfortunately most of his documentation and specimens were lost. Artist George Catlin (1796–1872) traveled up the Missouri as far as North Dakota, producing accurate paintings of Native American culture. A Swiss visitor Karl Bodmer (1809–93), was in the U.S. in 1832–34 with the Prince Maximilian expedition; he made compelling landscapes and portraits. In 1803, John James Audubon (1785–1851) immigrated from Haiti and established {{a reputation as a}} leading explorer, woodsman, painter, and naturalist. His greatest achievement involved classifying and painting in minute details 500 species of birds, published in Birds of America.|$|E

[...] Their first reputation establishing event was to build a small suspension bridge across the Schuylkill {{in order to better}} demonstrate their factory. When the US President put an embargo in place on Bituminous Coal imports from Great Britain in the tension prior to the War of 1812, the partners moved to secure an anthracite supply, which was an barely known, much misunderstood unexploited commodity at that time. Its discovery was credited to various individuals in widely varying locales by different historians but history speaks more clearly about that find which was first to be regularly commercially exploited, and inspire a revolution in energy use in the young United States. It was the outcrop stumbled over by the hunter Philip Ginter in 1791 that lead to the Lehigh Coal Mining Company (LCMC, 1792), then in 1818, the Lehigh Coal Company and the Lehigh Navigation Company a few months afterwards. White and Hazard were principals in both.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — For {{transportation}} of fluid, steam or air piping system is widely used. For installing the piping system pipes, flanges, piping supports, valves, piping fittings etc. are used, which are piping elements. They are manufactured as per Codes and standards. Equipment and piping layout design as per process requirement and available space. Above layout made {{out by the}} help of General arrangement <b>drawing,</b> <b>plant</b> layout and P & ID. Then after flexibility providing to piping system, for compensate the different loads by the engineer. Stresses in pipe or piping systems are generated due to loads like expansion & contraction due to thermal load, seismic load, wind load, sustained load, reaction load etc. the stress analysis is done by help of software like CAESAR II. In this paper, a Flare pipe line is designed and 3 D modeling is prepared in PDMS software. Attention is focused for stress analysis by Caesar-II software. So that various stress values, forces and deflections are analyzed at each node to make the design at safe operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|For space {{projecting}} architecture {{we understand}} (Boudon and Blanchot) {{the scope of}} the architect (and the student) designing, the situation in which it is installed to set conjectures. This part is linked to the slim design theories circulating through our schools and with the understanding of anthropological meaning of projecting environmental situations. The space required to design projects deal with miniature replicas of the material world. The modes of miniaturization involve ways of imagining the world and their artificial transformations. This approach is not properly referenced from the architecture but the philosophy and sociology of cognitive knowledge what has developed in some depth. The paper reviews the tools that make miniatures more general (and <b>drawing</b> <b>plant</b> section, programs 3 D morphing, animation and layout, etc.) and links to specific forms of imagination and control buildings budding (projected). The architectural education, whatever its approach would be, can not escape away of miniaturization techniques’ including the draw that is the most powerful, because it permits live inside better than the others (cognitive realism) and it allows scores very fast, and provides freedom...|$|E
40|$|In {{the sheet}} metal forming {{industry}} lubricants are applied in forming processes to expand the technological boundaries by reducing friction and wear. The friction between tool and sheet metal {{is crucial to the}} deep drawing process. Due to economic and ecological reasons the aim of the manufacturers is to reduce or even avoid the use of lubricants. Consequently, this approach enables both a shortening of the process chains and an essential saving of resources. The advantages of structured forming tools in lubricated processes concerning the reduction of the coefficient of friction by the appearance of lubricating micro pockets are well-known. However, without using any lubricant this effect does not work. In this case the contact area is reduced by structuring the forming tool which affects the tribological system. In this paper the influence of microstructures with different geometries and surface treatments (uncoated / a-C:H:Si-coating) on the coefficient of friction in dry metal forming of the alloy AA 5182 is compared to the frictional behaviour of unstructured forming tools using lubricant as reference. Before coating, the forming tools are machined by milling to generate tribologically effective microstructures. With the use of a strip <b>drawing</b> <b>plant</b> the effects of different surface microstructures and materials on the coefficient of friction are investigated...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{logarithm}} {{of the number of}} solutions of a random planted k-SAT formula concentrates around a deterministic n-independent threshold. Specifically, if F^*_k(α,n) is a random k-SAT formula on n variables, with clause density α and with a uniformly <b>drawn</b> <b>planted</b> solution, there exists a function ϕ_k(·) such that, besides for some α in a set of Lesbegue measure zero, we have 1 /n Z(F^*_k(α,n)) →ϕ_k(α) in probability, where Z(F) is the number of solutions of the formula F. This settles a problem left open in Abbe-Montanari RANDOM 2013, where the concentration is obtained only for the expected logarithm over the clause distribution. The result is also extended to a more general class of random planted CSPs; in particular, it is shown that the number of pre-images for the Goldreich one-way function model concentrates for some choices of the predicates.
