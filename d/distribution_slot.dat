If flux density distribution can be described by geometric parameters {{that are related to}} the force ripple and force ripple is described by the flux density distribution, the optimal design can be done by considering force ripple as cost function and geometric parameters as design variables.

40|$|Wireless data {{broadcasting}} is a promising way of disseminating {{information to a}} massive number of clients in an asymmetric communication environment where client-to-server communication is infeasible.

Due to the lack of communication from clients to the server, the server cannot know what a client needs at the current slot. We consider a broadcasting policy in which the server transmits, at each slot, the page which is most likely to be requested by the client, given the history of previous broadcasts. The policy is easily implementable since a simple recursive algorithm provides the conditional distribution of page requests at slot n from the same <b>distribution</b> at <b>slot</b> n- 1. The policy derives broadcasting sequences which are periodic in steady state and incurs low latency for page requests as it is verified by extensive numerical experiments with a wide variety of page request processes.
