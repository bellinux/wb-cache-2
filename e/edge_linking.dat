40|$|Traditional traffic {{engineering}} adapts the routing of traffic within the network to maximize performance. We propose {{a new approach}} that also adaptively changes where traffic enters and leaves the network—changing the “traffic matrix”, {{and not just the}} intradomain routing configuration. Our approach does not affect traffic patterns and BGP routes seen in neighboring networks, unlike conventional inter-domain {{traffic engineering}} where changes in BGP policies shift traffic and routes from one <b>edge</b> <b>link</b> to another. Instead, we capitalize on recent innovations in edge-link migration that enable seamless rehoming of an <b>edge</b> <b>link</b> to a different internal router in an ISP backbone network—completely transparent to the router in the neighboring domain. We present an optimization framework for traffic engineering with migration and develop algorithms that determine which <b>edge</b> <b>links</b> should migrate, where they should go, and how often they should move. Our experiments with Internet 2 traffic and topology data show that edge-link migration allows the network to carry 18. 8 % more traffic (at the same level of performance) over optimizing routing alone...|$|R

40|$|Feature {{detection}} in aerial images {{entails a}} number of specific problems, depending on the feature to be detected {{as well as the}} method to be used. This thesis focuses on the problem of automatically detecting roads in grayscale aerial images. The challenges of this particular problem are discussed and two systems are proposed as solutions. Both systems are edge-based methods and have two key steps: an edge detection step followed by an <b>edge</b> <b>linking</b> procedure. One system uses a variant of the Nevatia-Babu edge detector for the first step. This edge detection method revolves around convolutions of the aerial image with a series of masks and is quite simple to implement. The other system applies a wavelet edge detector to the images. Wavelets are briefly introduced and then a set of wavelet filters, developed by Mallat and Zhong, are detailed. In both road detection systems, the <b>edge</b> <b>linking</b> technique is the same. A new <b>edge</b> <b>linking</b> algorithm is developed using a zone-based technique, and is designed to link the long, low-curvature edges which represent roads. The results of applying each edge detection technique individually, followed by the <b>edge</b> <b>linking</b> procedure, to three test images are displayed. These results are compared and contrasted to try t...|$|E
40|$|Edges {{produced}} by existing edge detection algorithms often contain discontinuities. <b>Edge</b> <b>linking</b> as a post-processing step {{is very important}} for computer vision and pattern recognition. Nevertheless, subject to the lacking of information in the image, difficulties arise when it is tackled. The clonal selection algorithm (CSA), inspired by the basic features of adaptive immune response to antigenic stimulus, can exploit and explore the solution space parallelly and effectively. In this paper, by introducing receptor editing and making the proportions of receptor editing and hypermutation change adaptively, we propose an improved CSA for <b>edge</b> <b>linking</b> of images. The algorithm is tested on a set of artificial images devised with the aim of demonstrating the sort of features that may occur in real images. For all problems, the algorithm produced smooth contours while the details of the object shape are preserved.

40|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>linking</b> is a {{fundamental}} computer-vision task, yet presents difficulties arising {{from the lack of}} information in the image. Viewed as a constrained optimisation problem, it is NP hard [...] being isomorphic to the classical travelling salesman problem.

This paper examines the suitability of four well-known unsupervised techniques for the task of <b>edge</b> <b>linking,</b> by applying them to a test bed of edge point images and then evaluating their performance. Techniques studied are the elastic net, active contours (`snakes'), Kohonen map and Burr's modified elastic net.

40|$|One {{approach}} {{to understanding the}} complex global routing dynamics is to identify the impact of various factors in the routing system. In this paper we focus {{on one of these}} factors, the location of link failures. We build a formal analysis framework to examine whether link failures occurring at the network core and network edges have different impact on routing dynamics, as measured by the number of affected nodes, number of affected routes, and total number of updates. We validate our analytical results by simulations. Our results show that, on average, <b>edge</b> <b>link</b> failures tend to affect more nodes than core link failures, and core links failures tend to affect more routes. As the network grows in size, most of the routing updates will be caused by <b>edge</b> <b>link</b> failures. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>linking</b> is an {{important}} task in a boundary extraction problem. In this paper, a fuzzy approach is proposed. The proposed system consists of a fuzzy edge detection module and a fuzzy <b>edge</b> <b>linking</b> module, respectively. The fuzzy edge detector gives a fuzzy membership matrix and an initial edge map. Once the initial edge map is obtained, the pairing of the start and end points of the edges {{as well as the}} linking of appropriate segments of edges in the map can be found using the fuzzy <b>edge</b> <b>linking</b> module, as follows: First, for any start point, the corresponding end point is found by searching for the shortest distance between the points. Second, for any start point as a reference point, we search for the greatest fuzzy membership value among its neighbors, and connect the reference point to that neighbor. Then with that neighbor as the new reference point, this step of searching is repeated until the end point is reached. After applying the above technique to all the pairs of start and end points, all the open boundaries will be connected. A simulation evaluation of the proposed technique was carried out on an image “Cancer”. The simulation result shows an improvement on the outlines of the cancer cells. The proposed algorithm is simple and low cost, and can be implemented easily in some real-time applications...|$|E
