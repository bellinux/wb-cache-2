He prefers to employ a 4–3–3 formation, explaining it allows his teams to play entertaining football and makes them hard to beat, and it brought him success when at Tamworth and York. He has stuck with this formation despite charges from some of being tactically stubborn, saying: [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> way my teams play, the systems.

Nothing he could say or do was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> way people perceived him because of that moment. I wanted him to feel at home with us, to feel wanted." [...] Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.|$|E

500|$|U.S. Soccer {{was criticized}} after the {{match for the}} secretive bid process that allows teams to outspend their opponents for hosting rights. [...] Both the blind bidding process for hosting tournament matches {{and the manner in}} which MLS teams {{qualified}} for the tournament were widely criticized. [...] An example of the concerns raised around hosting came from FC Dallas midfielder Daniel Hernandez on Twitter, where he complained about Seattle's home-field advantage throughout the 2011 tournament. [...] Following the final, MLS and U.S. Soccer officials met to discuss rule changes to the tournament's host bidding system and team qualification processes. [...] Sounders FC owner Adrian Hanauer commented on the changes and the possibility of raising the profile of the tournament, [...] "I don’t think the bidding process is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> profile of the tournament, necessarily.

Silva remained relatively quiet until a UFC 148 media call in June 2012, when he stated through an interpreter: [...] "Chael Sonnen's {{going to get his}} ass kicked like he's never gotten his ass kicked before. What I'm going to do inside the Octagon is something that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> image of the sport. This is going to be violent and I am sorry.

I can guarantee that. He will need a plastic surgeon afterwards. And I know that he’s listening, so the game’s over. No more shit talking. It’s on now."

This [...] "Empire" [...] idea has been cadging about the British empire, trying to collect enthusiasm and devotion, since the days of Disraeli. It is, I submit, too big for the mean-spirited, and too tawdry and limited for the fine and generous. It leaves out the French and the Italians and the Belgians and all our blood brotherhood of allies. It has no compelling force in it. We British are not naturally Imperialist; we are something greater--or something less. For two years and a half now we have been fighting against Imperialism in its most extravagant form. It is a poor incentive to right living to propose to parody the devil we fight against.|$|E
60|$|Then Miss Stanbury went down, almost {{trembling}} as she went. The {{matter to}} her was one of vital importance. She was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> whole tenour of her life for the sake,--as she told herself,--of doing her duty by a relative whom {{she did not even}} know. But we may fairly suppose that there had in truth been a feeling beyond that, which taught her to desire to have some one near her to whom she might not only do her duty as guardian, but whom she might also love. She had tried this with her nephew; but her nephew had been too strong for her, too far from her, too unlike to herself. When he came to see her he had smoked a short pipe,--which had been shocking to her,--and he had spoken of Reform, and Trades' Unions, and meetings in the parks, as though they had not been Devil's ordinances. And he was very shy of going to church,--utterly refusing to be taken there twice on the same Sunday. And he had told his aunt that owing to a peculiar and unfortunate weakness in his constitution he could not listen to the reading of sermons. And then she was almost certain that he had once kissed one of the maids! She had found it impossible to manage him in any way; and when he positively declared himself as permanently devoted to the degrading iniquities of penny newspapers, she had thought it best to cast him off altogether. Now, thus late in life, she was going to make another venture, to try an altogether new mode of living,--in order, as she said to herself, that she might be of some use to somebody,--but, no doubt, with a further unexpressed hope in her bosom, that the solitude of her life might be relieved by the companionship of some one whom she might love. She had arrayed herself in a clean cap and her evening gown, and she went down-stairs looking sternly, with a fully-developed idea that she must initiate her new duties by assuming a mastery at once. But inwardly she trembled, and was intensely anxious as to the first appearance of her niece. Of course there would be a little morsel of a bonnet. She hated those vile patches,--dirty flat daubs of millinery as she called them; but they had become too general for her to refuse admittance for such a thing within her doors. But a chignon, a bandbox behind the noddle,--she would not endure. And then there were other details of feminine gear, which shall not be specified, as to which she was painfully anxious,--almost forgetting in her anxiety that the dress of this young woman whom she was about to see must have ever been regulated by the closest possible economy.|$|E
