50|$|LVDS {{does not}} specify a bit {{encoding}} scheme {{because it is}} a physical layer standard only. LVDS accommodates any user-specified encoding scheme for sending and receiving data across an LVDS link, including 8b/10b encoded data. An 8b/10b encoding scheme embeds the clock signal information and has the added benefit of DC balance. DC balance is necessary for AC-coupled transmission paths (such as capacitive or transformer-coupled paths). There are also DC-balance encoding methods for the start bit/stop bit embedded clock, which usually include a <b>data</b> <b>scrambling</b> technique. The key point in LVDS is the physical layer signaling to transport bits across wires. It is compatible with almost all data encoding and clock embedding techniques.|$|E
40|$|Abstract DeKaRT {{primitives}} are key-dependent reversible circuits {{presented at}} CHES 2003. According to the author, the circuits described {{are suitable for}} <b>data</b> <b>scrambling</b> but also as building blocks for block ciphers. <b>Data</b> <b>scrambling</b> of internal links and memories on smart card chips is intended for protecting data against probing attacks. In this paper, we analyze the DeKaRT primitive using linear cryptanalysis. We show that despite its key-dependent behavior, DeKaRT still has strongly linear structures, that can be exploited even under the particular hypothesis that only one bit of the ciphertexts is available to the attacker (as {{it is the case}} in the context of probing attacks), and using very few plaintext-ciphertext pairs.

However, current SNS sites such as Facebook or Twitter assume that users trust SNS providers with the access control of their data. In this paper we propose Scramble, the im-plementation of a SNS-independent Firefox extension that allows users to enforce access control over their <b>data.</b> <b>Scramble</b> lets users define ac-cess control lists (ACL) of authorised users for each piece of data, based on their preferences. The definition of ACL is facilitated through the possibility of dynamically defining contact groups. In turn, the confiden-tiality and integrity of one data item is enforced using cryptographic techniques. When accessing a SNS that contains <b>data</b> encrypted using <b>Scramble,</b> the plugin transparently decrypts and checks integrity of the encrypted content. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) {{have always}} {{received}} considerable attention {{in computer science}} especially in coding theory and in cryptography. The scope of applications of LFSRs is wide: <b>data</b> <b>scrambling,</b> spread spectrum, build in self tests (BISTs) [...] . They have to be implemented either in hardware or in software. Unlike hardware, software applications have not been very popular. The main reason is that, even if the LFSR synthesis in software {{is very similar to}} the LFSR synthesis on Xilinx FPGA, the overall processing is parallel in hardware while it is almost sequential in software, leading to low throughput implementations. If the naive LFSR implementation is in favor of hardware, increasing the number of LFSR steps computed at the same time can considerably improve software implementation. For instance, we obtain a 103 speedup factor for a 128 -bit LFSR on 64 -bit processors. Unfortunately, this cannot be obtain for all LFSRs. We here describe how LFSR parameters must be chosen to obtain an efficient implementation. ...|$|E

30|$|As {{electronic}} communications {{become more}} prevalent, mobile and universal, {{the threats of}} data compromises also accordingly loom larger. In {{the context of a}} body sensor network (BSN), which permits pervasive monitoring of potentially sensitive medical data, security and privacy concerns are particularly important. It is a challenge to implement traditional security infrastructures in these types of lightweight networks since they are by design limited in both computational and communication resources. A key enabling technology for secure communications in BSN's has emerged to be biometrics. In this work, we present two complementary approaches which exploit physiological signals to address security issues: (1) a resource-efficient key management system for generating and distributing cryptographic keys to constituent sensors in a BSN; (2) a novel <b>data</b> <b>scrambling</b> method, based on interpolation and random sampling, that is envisioned as a potential alternative to conventional symmetric encryption algorithms for certain types of data. The former targets the resource constraints in BSN's, while the latter addresses the fuzzy variability of biometric signals, which has largely precluded the direct application of conventional encryption. Using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as biometrics, the resulting computer simulations demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of these methods for delivering secure communications in BSN's.|$|E

30|$|Some trial {{encoding}} algorithms were proposed. Their implementation {{is quite}} simple relative to some comparable encoders. performance comparisons with some well-known similar algorithms were conducted. The results show better or no worse performance: the symmetric cipher has a slight edge over some common block ciphers, the digital signature can run considerably faster than some common schemes, the hash and the bit compressor {{are near the}} same {{with some of the}} most common. To sum up the approaches: optional encryption of the IV at the outset, followed by 2 rounds of data randomization with 1 round of <b>data</b> <b>scrambling</b> sandwiched in between in the symmetric cipher, adaptation of Hill cipher by use of un-invertible matrices as part of the verification keys in the signature scheme, chaining of addition/XOR/multiplication, followed by bit permutation and ending with some AND’s in the hash. The bit compressor is slightly different from Huffman coding that uses an array rather than a binary tree as the data structure, with an advantage and a disadvantage. Compression may be enhanced through bytes concatenation and Rice coding. A non-cryptographic version of the hash is for burst error correction.|$|E

Side-channel attacks such as differential power or differential electromagnetic analysis have proven to be very effective against memory security. Furthermore, blending cold-boot attacks with DPA or DEMA can overpower even a high-level of security in cache or main memories. In this scope, <b>data</b> <b>scrambling</b> techniques have been explored and employed to improve the security, with a minor penalty in performance. Enforcing security techniques and methods in cache memories is risky because any substantial reduction in the cache memory speed might be devastating to the CPU, which is why the performance penalty must be minimal. In this paper, we introduce an improved scrambling technique which uses random masking of the scrambling vector and it is designed to protect cache memories against cold-boot and differential power or electromagnetic attacks.

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{validate}} user requirements, tests are often conducted on real data. However, developments and tests {{are more and}} more outsourced, leading companies to provide external staff with real confidential data. A solution to this problem is known as <b>Data</b> <b>Scrambling.</b> Many algorithms aim at smartly replacing true data by false but realistic ones. However, nothing has been developed to automate the crucial task of the detection of the data to be scrambled. In this paper we propose an innovative approach- and its implementation as an expert system- to achieve the automatic detection of the candidate attributes for scrambling. Our approach is mainly based on semantic rules that determine which concepts have to be scrambled, and on a linguistic component that retrieves the attributes that semantically correspond to these concepts. Since attributes can not be considered independently from each other we also address the challenging problem of the propagation of the scrambling among the whole database. An important contribution of our approach is to provide a semantic modelling of sensitive data. This knowledge is made available through production rules, operationalizing the sensitive data detection. Keywords-data privacy; semantic rule; sensitive data; I...|$|E
