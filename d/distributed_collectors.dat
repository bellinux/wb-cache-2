40|$|With the {{continued}} growth in interest in distributed systems, garbage collection is actively receiving attention by designers of distributed languages [Bal, 1990]. Distribution adds another dimension of complexity {{to an already}} complex problem. A comprehensive review and bibliography of distributed garbage collection literature up to 1992 is presented. As <b>distributed</b> <b>collectors</b> are largely based on nondistributed collectors these are first briefly reviewed.

It was configured as a prototype for plants in the 1000 to 10, 000 -kWe size range for application to small communities or industrial users either grid-connected or isolated from a utility grid.

40|$|In South Africa, the {{indigenous}} mussel Perna perna {{is threatened by}} both an invasive species and excessive human exploitation. The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is an invasive species that has been introduced to {{many parts of the}} world. In South Africa, this species arrived in the 1970 s and spread rapidly along the west coast where today it is the dominant mussel species. Along the west coast, M. galloprovincialis is competitively superior in all aspects to {{the indigenous}} mussel species, and, as a result, has displaced some of them. On the south coast, M. galloprovincialis found more oligotrophic waters, higher species richness, and a stronger competitor in the indigenous mussel P. perna. The rate of spread of M. galloprovincialis along the south coast has decreased over the last 10 years and the present eastern limit of its distribution in South African is East London. On the south coast, M. galloprovincialis has not yet completely replaced P. perna; instead, the two exhibit spatial segregation, with P. perna dominating the low shore, M. galloprovincialis the high shore and an overlap zone between the two. An experiment on competition was carried out at one site on the south coast. The results showed that, on the low shore, P. perna is a more dominant competitor for space than M. galloprovincialis. Also byssus attachment of the two species differs, P. perna being much stronger than M. galloprovincialis, which suffers high mortality due to wave action on the low shore, especially in monospecific beds. As a result, mortality of M. galloprovincialis through wave action is reduced by the presence of P. perna, which seems to confer protection against dislodgement. However, in the absence of strong wave action, P. perna competitively excludes M. galloprovincialis. Human exploitation along 160 km of coast was examined by sampling mussel populations and using aerial surveys to determine where harvesters were <b>distributed.</b> <b>Collectors</b> did not seem to discriminate between species. The study has shown that higher abundances of mussels were found in protected or inaccessible sites, while in unprotected sites mussels were scarce.

40|$|In {{this report}} {{we present a}} {{fault-tolerant}} and efficient algorithm for distributed garbage collection and prove its correctness. The algorithm is a generalization of reference counting; it maintains a set of identifiers for processes with references to an object.

The primary cost for maintaining the set is one remote procedure call when an object reference is transferred to a new process for the first time.

Explicitly stopping a whole distributed application is becoming increasingly difficult. In that context, there is a strong need to free resources a soon as they become useless, leading to automatic termination, using distributed garbage collecting techniques. We propose in this paper a new <b>distributed</b> garbage <b>collector</b> for active objects taking into account cycles but with a complexity similar to the <b>distributed</b> garbage <b>collector</b> of Java/RMI. The algorithm is based on a different approach to collect acyclic and cyclic garbage. On one hand, acyclic garbage is collected by knowing the immediate referencers of an active object and detecting the lack of these referencers. This behavior with respect to acyclic garbage is common to the <b>distributed</b> garbage <b>collector</b> of RMI. On the other hand, cyclic garbage is detected by considering the recursive closure of all the referencers of an active object and finding cycles of active objects waiting for requests. These cycles are found by letting idle active objects make a consensus on a common final activity. The algorithm is fully distributed and has been implemented with no modifications to the local garbage collector. Benchmarks have shown the scalability of the algorithm in a grid context...|$|R
