25|$|Pierre and Eugénie Savoye {{approached}} Corbusier {{about building}} a country home in Poissy {{in the spring of}} 1928. The site was on a green field on an otherwise wooded plot of land with a magnificent landscape view to the north west that corresponded with the approach to the site along the road. Other than an initial brief prepared by Emile for a summer house, space for cars, an extra bedroom and a caretaker's lodge, Corbusier had such freedom with the job that he was only limited by his own architectural palette. He began work on the project in September 1928. His initial ideas were those that eventually manifested themselves in the final building but between Autumn 1928 and Spring 1929 he undertook a series of alternatives that were influenced primarily by the Savoye's concern about cost. The eventual solution to this problem was to reduce the volume of the building by moving the master bedroom down to the first floor and reducing the <b>grid</b> <b>spacing</b> down from 5 metres to 4.75 metres.|$|E

The projective reconstruction is one way to reduce the effort of the calibration because it does not need Euclid metric information, but rather only correspondences of several points between the images. For demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed projective grid definition, we modify the voxel coloring algorithm for the projective voxel scheme.

The study area {{is a part of the}} Narmada river basin in Madhya Pradesh state, which is located in the central part of India and the area covered 20, 558  km 2.

Vertical accuracy of DEMs has been assessed using actual heights of the sample points that have been taken considering planimetric survey based map (toposheet). Elevations of DEMs are converted to the same vertical datum from WGS 84 to MSL (Mean Sea Level), before the accuracy assessment and modelling.
