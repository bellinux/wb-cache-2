25|$|Other {{research}} findings report {{a projection of}} opposite trend. Although the demand <b>for</b> <b>nurses</b> continues to increase, the rate of employment has slowed down since 1994 because hospitals were incorporating more less-skilled nursing personnel to substitute <b>for</b> <b>nurses.</b> With the decrease in employment, the earnings <b>for</b> <b>nurses</b> decreased.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present work in {{progress}} on the assessment of numeracy <b>for</b> <b>nursing</b> in two interdisciplinary projects. The background to these studies is that despite widespread recognition that numeracy is a key competence for safe and effective professional practice in nursing, and research studies in various countries which reveal a lack of proficiency within both the student population and amongst registered nurses, there is no international consensus on the nature and scope of numeracy <b>for</b> <b>nursing.</b> The studies are: 'Medication dosage calculation: a benchmark assessment for nursing' and 'Numeracy for nursing'. The first study aims to create a national benchmark <b>for</b> numeracy <b>for</b> <b>nursing</b> in Scotland against which numeracy <b>for</b> <b>nursing</b> may be assessed, initially at point of registration but potentially thereafter at other stages of nurse preparation and in practice. The second study is an exploratory investigation of aspects of teaching, learning and assessment of numeracy <b>for</b> <b>nursing</b> in the undergraduate/Diploma Nursing programme in a large School of Nursing in England...|$|R

25|$|International {{recruitment}} {{is often}} used to fill the nursing gap but gives rise to concern now that the U.S. Homeland Security has stopped the issuance of the H-1C visa, which was deemed specifically <b>for</b> <b>nurses.</b> Because of the Affordable Care Act, which will result in an increased number of insured Americans, it is estimated that there will be an even greater need <b>for</b> <b>nurses</b> in the near future.
