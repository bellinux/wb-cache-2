5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} {{that in some}} people, development of schizophrenia is related to intestinal tract dysfunction such as seen with non-celiac <b>gluten</b> sensitivity or abnormalities in the intestinal flora. A subgroup of persons with schizophrenia present an immune response to <b>gluten</b> different from that found in people with celiac, with elevated levels of certain serum biomarkers of <b>gluten</b> sensitivity such as anti-gliadin IgG or anti-gliadin IgA antibodies.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} coeliac disease or non-celiac <b>gluten</b> {{sensitivity}} and occipital calcifications, a gluten-free diet may decrease {{the frequency of}} seizures.|$|E

He sits {{on the board of}} In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre and has served as co-chair of the capital campaign of the Little Earth for United Tribes. Schiff is gay and does not eat <b>gluten.</b>|$|E
5|$|Proteins were {{recognized}} as a distinct class of biological molecules {{in the eighteenth century}} by Antoine Fourcroy and others, distinguished by the molecules' ability to coagulate or flocculate under treatments with heat or acid. Noted examples at the time included albumin from egg whites, blood serum albumin, fibrin, and wheat <b>gluten.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} links epilepsy and coeliac {{disease and}} non-celiac <b>gluten</b> sensitivity, while other evidence does not. There {{appears to be}} a specific syndrome which includes coeliac disease, epilepsy and calcifications in the brain. A 2012 review estimates that between 1% and 6% of people with epilepsy have CD while 1% of the general population has the condition.|$|E
5|$|Gardein (a {{portmanteau}} {{of garden}} and protein) {{is a product}} line of meat-free foods made by Garden Protein International in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. In November 2014, Pinnacle Foods purchased Gardein for $154 million. Founder Yves Potvin stayed on with the company, and has stated that the buy-out assisted Gardein to access more capital and expand manufacturing facilities to Hagerstown. All Gardein products are vegan, and they are certified by Vegan Action. Most of Gardein's products are certified Kosher pareve by Kosher Check (The Orthodox Rabbinical Council of BC). In 2014, they added gluten-free beefless products to their range {{in response to the}} expanding <b>gluten</b> allergy market.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of non-infectious causes of {{inflammation}} of the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the more common include medications (like NSAIDs), certain foods such as lactose (in those who are intolerant), and <b>gluten</b> (in those with celiac disease). Crohn's disease is also a non-infectious source of (often severe) gastroenteritis. Disease secondary to toxins may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: ciguatera poisoning due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish, scombroid associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, tetrodotoxin poisoning from the consumption of puffer fish among others, and botulism typically due to improperly preserved food.|$|E

25|$|In a {{small part}} of the general population, <b>gluten</b> – the major part of wheat protein – can trigger coeliac disease, non-coeliac <b>gluten</b> sensitivity, <b>gluten</b> ataxia and {{dermatitis}} herpetiformis.|$|E
25|$|As {{buckwheat}} {{contains no}} <b>gluten,</b> {{it may be}} eaten by people with gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease, non-celiac <b>gluten</b> sensitivity or dermatitis herpetiformis. Nevertheless, buckwheat may have <b>gluten</b> contamination.|$|E
25|$|The {{quality of}} the wheat protein <b>gluten.</b> This protein can {{determine}} the suitability of a wheat to a particular dish. A strong and elastic <b>gluten</b> present in bread wheats enables dough to trap carbon dioxide during leavening, but elastic <b>gluten</b> interferes with the rolling of pasta into thin sheets. The <b>gluten</b> protein in durum wheats used for pasta is strong but not elastic.|$|E
25|$|While coeliac {{disease is}} caused by a {{reaction}} to wheat proteins, it {{is not the same as}} a wheat allergy. Other diseases triggered by eating <b>gluten</b> are non-coeliac <b>gluten</b> sensitivity, (estimated to affect 0.5% to 13% of the general population), <b>gluten</b> ataxia and dermatitis herpetiformis.|$|E
25|$|Breastfeeding or {{introduction}} of <b>gluten</b> while breastfeeding don't protect against celiac disease among at-risk children. Breast milk of healthy human mothers who eat gluten-containing foods presents {{high levels of}} non-degraded gliadin (the main <b>gluten</b> protein). Early {{introduction of}} traces of <b>gluten</b> in babies to potentially induce tolerance doesn't {{reduce the risk of}} developing celiac disease. Delaying the introduction of <b>gluten</b> does not prevent, but is associated with a delayed onset of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Celiac disease, an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{caused by}} an immune response to the protein <b>gluten,</b> results in <b>gluten</b> intolerance {{and can lead to}} temporary lactose intolerance.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to wheat <b>gluten,</b> products containing rice protein {{have also been}} contaminated with melamine. Natural Balance Pet Foods recalled two products on 16 April due to kidney damage associated with melamine contamination despite the products not containing wheat <b>gluten.</b> Melamine has also been implicated in corn <b>gluten</b> in South Africa.|$|E
25|$|In November 2012, O’Keeffe {{appeared}} on CBS’s The Talk and {{teamed up with}} Udi’s <b>gluten</b> free to make several <b>gluten</b> free recipes for the holiday season.|$|E
25|$|Reports of {{widespread}} and possibly intentional adulteration of Chinese animal feed with melamine {{have raised the}} issue of melamine contamination in the human food supply, both in China and abroad. On 27 April, the U.S. FDA subjected all vegetable proteins imported from China, intended for human or animal consumption, to detention without physical examination, including: wheat <b>gluten,</b> rice <b>gluten,</b> rice protein, rice protein concentrate, corn <b>gluten,</b> corn <b>gluten</b> meal, corn byproducts, soy protein, soy <b>gluten,</b> proteins (includes amino acids and protein hydrosylates), and mung bean protein. In a teleconference with reporters on 1 May, officials from the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture said between 2.5 and 3 million people in the United States had consumed chickens that had consumed feed containing contaminated vegetable protein from China.|$|E
25|$|Wheat {{is often}} a cryptic {{contaminant}} of many foods; more obvious items are bread crumbs, maltodextrin, bran, cereal extract, couscous, cracker meal, enriched flour, <b>gluten,</b> high-gluten flour, high-protein flour, seitan, semolina wheat, vital <b>gluten,</b> wheat bran, wheat germ, wheat <b>gluten,</b> wheat malt, wheat starch or whole wheat flour. Less obvious sources of wheat could be gelatinized starch, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, modified food starch, modified starch, natural flavoring, soy sauce, soy bean paste, hoisin sauce, starch, vegetable gum, specifically Beta-glucan, vegetable starch.|$|E
25|$|The {{immunochemistry}} of Triticeae glutens {{is important}} in several inflammatory diseases. It can be subdivided into innate responses (direct stimulation of immune system), class II mediated presentation (HLA DQ), class I meditiated stimulation of killer cells, and antibody recognition. The responses to <b>gluten</b> proteins and polypeptide regions differs according {{to the type of}} <b>gluten</b> sensitivity. The response is also dependent on the genetic makeup of the human leukocyte antigen genes. In <b>gluten</b> sensitive enteropathy, there are 4 types of recognition, innate immunity (a form of cellular immunity priming), HLA-DQ, and antibody recognition of gliadin and transglutaminase. With idiopathic <b>gluten</b> sensitivity only antibody recognition to gliadin has been resolved. In wheat allergy, the response pathways are mediated through IgE against other wheat proteins and other forms of gliadin.|$|E
25|$|Celiac disease (coeliac disease) is a {{permanent}} intolerance to <b>gluten</b> proteins in genetically predisposed people, having a prevalence of about 1% in the developed world. <b>Gluten</b> is present in wheat, barley, rye, oat, and all their species and hybrids and contains hundreds of proteins, with high contents of prolamins.|$|E
25|$|Like wheat, rye, {{and their}} hybrids and derivatives, barley {{contains}} <b>gluten,</b> {{which makes it}} an unsuitable grain for consumption by people with gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease, non-celiac <b>gluten</b> sensitivity and wheat allergy sufferers, among others. Nevertheless, some wheat allergy patients can tolerate barley or rye.|$|E

25|$|Antibody {{recognition}} of <b>gluten</b> is complex. Direct binding to <b>gluten</b> such as anti-gliadin antibodies has an ambiguous pathogenesis in coeliac disease. The crosslinking of gliadin with tissue transglutaminase {{leads to the}} production of anti-transglutaminase antibodies, but this is mediated through T-cell {{recognition of}} gliadin. The allergic recognition of gliadin by mast cells, eosinophiles in the presence of IgE has notable direct consequences, such as exercise-induced anaphylaxis.|$|E
25|$|Non-celiac <b>gluten</b> {{sensitivity}} (NCGS) may be {{an underlying}} cause of fibromyalgia symptoms but further research is needed.|$|E
25|$|Menu Foods: Over 50 {{brands of}} dog food, and over 40 brands of cat food. Almost {{all of the}} foods are wet foods, {{specifically}} the 'cuts and gravy' varieties. As a precautionary measure, Menu Foods also recalled all brands of food with wheat <b>gluten</b> in them even though {{the source of the}} <b>gluten</b> was {{not the same as the}} source behind the contaminated findings.|$|E
25|$|Wheat and soy {{macaroni}} products – {{begins as}} macaroni products {{with the addition}} of at least 12.5% of soy flour as a fraction of the total soy and wheat flour used. The addition the various forms of egg whites and disodium phosphate are not permitted. Gum <b>gluten</b> may be added with a limitation that the total protein content derived from the combination of the flours and added <b>gluten</b> not exceed 13%.|$|E
25|$|Celiac disease, a {{disorder}} {{characterized by an}} auto-immune response to <b>gluten,</b> also commonly results in demineralization of the enamel.|$|E
25|$|In July 2010, {{before the}} Davis Cup clash away at Croatia, Djokovic made another {{addition}} to his team – nutritionist Igor Četojević who additionally focuses on Chinese medicine and does acupuncture. He allegedly discovered that the tennis player suffers from <b>gluten</b> intolerance, using applied kinesiology, and that he cannot eat <b>gluten,</b> purging it from his diet. It appeared to have worked as Djokovic began feeling stronger, quicker, and much more fit.|$|E
25|$|Durum– Very hard, translucent, light-colored grain {{used to make}} {{semolina}} flour for pasta & bulghur; high in protein, specifically, <b>gluten</b> protein.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, it was {{hypothesized}} that autism can be caused or aggravated by opioid peptides like casomorphine that are metabolic products of <b>gluten</b> and casein. Based on this hypothesis, diets that eliminate foods containing either <b>gluten</b> or casein, or both, are widely promoted, and many testimonials can be found describing benefits in autism-related symptoms, notably social engagement and verbal skills. Studies supporting these claims have had significant flaws, so these data are inadequate to guide treatment recommendations.|$|E
25|$|GSE {{has been}} found to be {{associated}} with alopecia areata (patchy baldness) whereas regrowth did not necessarily occur on a <b>gluten</b> free diet.|$|E
25|$|Celiac {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder triggered by <b>gluten</b> proteins such as gliadin (present in wheat, rye, and barley). It is a non-IgE-mediated food allergy by definition.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all types}} of rice, glutinous rice does not contain dietary <b>gluten</b> (i.e. does not contain {{glutenin}} and gliadin), and should be safe for gluten-free diets.|$|E
25|$|Also {{while many}} probiotics have major allergens {{in the growth}} solution, GLB44 has no major allergens {{as part of its}} growth medium. For example, the growth medium for L. plantarum 299v {{includes}} barley that has small content of <b>gluten,</b> and L. rhamnosus GG has small content of casein. The fact that GLB44 is grown in vegetable juice means GLB44 does not contain any of the seven major allergens for which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires additional labeling: lactose, <b>gluten,</b> soya, peanuts, tree nuts, fish or crustacean shellfish.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{varieties}} and hybrids of wheat, emmer is unsuitable {{for people with}} gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease, non-celiac <b>gluten</b> sensitivity and wheat allergy sufferers, among others.|$|E
25|$|Oat prolamins, named avenins, {{are similar}} to {{gliadins}} found in wheat, hordeins in barley, and secalins in rye, which are collectively named <b>gluten.</b> Avenins toxicity in celiac people depends on the oat cultivar consumed because of prolamin genes, protein amino acid sequences, and the immunoreactivities of toxic prolamins which vary among oat varieties. Also, oats products are frequently cross-contaminated with other gluten-containing cereals during grain harvesting, transport, storage or processing. Pure oats contain less than 20 parts per million of <b>gluten</b> from wheat, barley, rye, or any of their hybrids.|$|E
