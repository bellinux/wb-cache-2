40|$|Rapid {{escalation}} in {{fuel prices}} has motivated {{the manufacturers of}} heavy commercial vehicles to focus their attention towards efficient aerodynamic design of surface transport systems such as trucks–trailers, railways etc. In {{order to reduce the}} drag force acting on truck–trailer assemblies, the flow separation phenomena, occurring {{on the roof of the}} trailers, need to be controlled. A number of add-on devices have been developed for this purpose by different investigators but most of these devices are still not being used for several reasons including difficult integration with the structure and non-optimal configuration. In the present study, based on the theory of moving surface boundary layer control, a novel <b>fuel</b> <b>saving</b> <b>device</b> has been developed, and its operation optimised, in order to control the flow separation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based techniques have been employed to analyse the aerodynamic performance of a truck–trailer assembly, integrated with a moving surface boundary layer control device (MSBC). The device has been shown to be very effective in reducing the flow drag force being imparted on the truck – trailer assembly, and hence reducing the fuel consumption. Operation of MSBC device has been optimised to obtain a range of rotational speeds of the device over which it provides maximum reduction in aerodynamic drag...|$|E
40|$|Small, {{high power}} density {{turbocharged}} engines coupled to {{kinetic energy recovery}} systems {{are one of the}} key areas of development for both passenger and racing cars. In passenger cars, the KERS may reduce the amount of thermal energy needed to reaccelerate the car following a deceleration recovering part of the braking energy. This translates in a first, significant fuel energy saving. Also considering the KERS torque boost increasing the total torque available to accelerate the car, large engines working at very low brake mean effective pressures and efficiencies over driving cycles may also be replaced by small higher power density engines working at much higher brake mean effective pressures and therefore much higher part load efficiencies. In racing cars, the coupling of small engines to KERS may improve the perception of racing being more environmentally friendly. The KERS is more a performance boost than a <b>fuel</b> <b>saving</b> <b>device,</b> permitting about same lap times with smaller engines. The actual fuel saving is therefore only the one of the smaller thermal engine having less thermal power. New F 1 2014 power train rules may pave the way for a fuel economy KERS development for racing that may also be beneficial to road applications. The paper presents 2014 F 1 engine and KERS hypotheses and simulation of lap times...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the aerodynamic impact of various <b>fuel</b> <b>saving</b> <b>devices</b> used in a commercial vehicle (i. e., semi-trailer truck). To measure the aerodynamic drag produced by the vehicle, a wind tunnel study was undertaken using a 1 / 10 th scale model truck. The aerodynamic drags on the baseline vehicle including different external attachments (i. e., front faring, side skirting and gap filling) were measured for a range of vehicle operating speeds and yaw angles, and with different combinations. The results show that these external attachments (fairing and covering) have notable impact on aerodynamic drag as they can reduce up to around 26 % aerodynamic drag over the baseline model depending on cross wind effects. The full-skirting (using the front fairing, side skirting and gap filling) has maximum impact whereas only front fairing has minimum impact on aerodynamic drag reduction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{fuel cost}} {{of the motor vehicle}} {{operating}} on its common route {{is an important part of}} the operating cost. Therefore, the importance of the <b>fuel</b> <b>saving</b> is increasing day by day. One of the parameters which improve <b>fuel</b> <b>saving</b> is the regulation of driving characteristics. The number and duration of stop is increased by the heavy traffic load. It is possible to improve the <b>fuel</b> <b>saving</b> with regulation of traffic flow and driving characteristics. The researches show that the regulation of the traffic flow decreases fuel consumption, but it is not enough to improve <b>fuel</b> <b>saving</b> without the regulation of driving characteristics. This study analyses the fuel consumption of two trips of city bus operating on its common route and determines the effect of traffic density and driving characteristics on fuel consumption. Finally it offers some suggestions about regulation of driving characteristics to improve the <b>fuel</b> <b>saving.</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>saving</b> is determined according to the results obtained from simulation program.

40|$|Due to {{the innate}} {{complexity}} of the task drivers have to manage multiple goals while driving {{and the importance of}} certain goals may vary over time leading to priority being given to different goals depending on the circumstances. This study aimed to investigate drivers' behavioral regulation while managing multiple goals during driving. To do so participants drove on urban and rural roads in a driving simulator while trying to manage <b>fuel</b> <b>saving</b> and time saving goals, besides the safety goals that are always present during driving. A between-subjects design was used with one group of drivers managing two goals (safety and <b>fuel</b> <b>saving)</b> and another group managing three goals (safety, <b>fuel</b> <b>saving,</b> and time saving) while driving. Participants were provided continuous feedback on the <b>fuel</b> <b>saving</b> goal via a meter on the dashboard. The results indicate that even when a <b>fuel</b> <b>saving</b> or time saving goal is salient, safety goals are still given highest priority when interactions with other road users take place and when interacting with a traffic light. Additionally, performance on the <b>fuel</b> <b>saving</b> goal diminished for the group that had to manage <b>fuel</b> <b>saving</b> and time saving together. The theoretical implications for a goal hierarchy in driving tasks and practical implications for eco-driving are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. federal {{government}} enacted fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy trucks {{for the first}} time in September 2011. Rationales for using this policy tool typically depend upon frictions existing in the marketplace or consumers being myopic, such that vehicle purchasers undervalue the future <b>fuel</b> <b>savings</b> from increased <b>fuel</b> efficiency. We measure by how much long-haul truck owners undervalue future <b>fuel</b> <b>savings</b> by employing recent advances to the classic hedonic approach to estimate the distribution of willingness-to-pay for fuel efficiency. We find significant heterogeneity in truck owners' willingness to pay for fuel efficiency, with the elasticity of fuel efficiency to price ranging from 0. 51 at the 10 th percentile to 1. 33 at the 90 th percentile, and an average of 0. 91. Combining these results with estimates of future <b>fuel</b> <b>savings</b> from increases in fuel efficiency, we find that long-haul truck owners' willingness-to-pay for a 1 percent increase in fuel efficiency is, on average, just 29. 5 percent of the expected future <b>fuel</b> <b>savings.</b> These results suggest that introducing fuel efficiency standards for heavy trucks might be an effective policy tool to raise medium and heavy trucks' fuel economy...|$|R
