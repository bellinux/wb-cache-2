5|$|Another <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> Sahure had not {{faded from}} memory during the Middle Kingdom is the Westcar Papyrus, {{which was written}} during the 12th Dynasty. The papyrus tells the mythical story {{of the origins of}} the 5th Dynasty, {{presenting}} kings Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai as three brothers, sons of Ra and a woman named Rededjet.|$|E
5|$|Benson in 2010 {{concluded}} {{from its}} size and common distribution that Megalosaurus was the apex predator of its habitat. He saw the absence of Cetiosaurus on the French Armorican Massif as an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> Megalosaurus too did not live on that island and {{was limited to the}} London-Brabant Massif.|$|E
5|$|Early critics, such as Thomas Campbell in 1838, {{saw this}} {{constant}} {{allusion to the}} theatre as an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> Prospero was meant to represent Shakespeare; the character's renunciation of magic thus signalling Shakespeare's farewell to the stage. This theory persists among later critics, and remains solidly within the critical canon.|$|E
50|$|From an {{economic}} perspective, poor soil {{was only one}} problem Athens had to deal with. There are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> unemployment was a substantial and on-going problem for much of Athens' history. Solon's reforms encouraged economic diversity and trade. If more people began to leave agriculture, there are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> Athens had problems keeping them employed. Even if they found work, there are <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> many were not fully benefiting from Athens' economy.|$|R

5|$|Like Compsognathus, {{and unlike}} Sinosauropteryx, {{a patch of}} fossilized skin from the tail and hindlimb of the {{possible}} relative Juravenator starki shows mainly scales, though there is some <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> simple feathers were also present in the preserved areas. This may mean that a feather covering was not ubiquitous in this group of dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria contain {{their own}} genome, an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> they {{are derived from}} {{bacteria}} through endosymbiosis. However, the ancestral endosymbiont genome has lost most of its genes so that the mitochondrial genome {{is one of the}} most reduced genomes across organisms.|$|E

5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} of {{the chest}} wall is commonly among the first signs to appear that barotrauma, damage caused by excessive pressure, has occurred, {{and it is an}} <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the lung was subjected to significant barotrauma. Thus the phenomenon may occur in diving injuries.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it appears}} that the Council of Chelsea {{approved}} Lichfield's elevation to an archdiocese, Hygeberht, who was present, remained a bishop at its conclusion; he signed the council's report still as a bishop. There is no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> he played any significant part in the council nor in the actions that led to him becoming an archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> {{feet and}} other {{tetrapod}} traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} investigation, police had noted {{undisturbed}} human excrement {{in the elevator}} shaft, which Conley said he had left there before the murder. Use of the elevator on the Monday after the murder crushed the excrement, which Slaton concluded was an <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the elevator {{could not have been}} used as described by Conley, casting doubt on his testimony.|$|E

5|$|Greek mythology {{is known}} today {{primarily}} from Greek literature and representations on visual media {{dating from the}} Geometric period from c. 900–800 BC onward. In fact, literary and archaeological sources integrate, sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict; however, in many cases, {{the existence of this}} corpus of data is a strong <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots.|$|E
5|$|Marrella was {{the first}} Burgess Shale fossil that Whittington re-examined, and gave the first <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> surprises were on the way. Although clearly an {{arthropod}} that walked on the sea-floor, Marella {{was very different from}} the known marine arthropod groups (trilobites, crustaceans and chelicerates) in the structure of its legs and gills, and above all in the number and positions of the appendages on its head, which are the main feature used to classify arthropods. A fossil of Marrella from the Burgess Shale has also provided the earliest clear evidence of molting.|$|E

5|$|On February 4, 2009, a posting on the 4chan /b/ {{board said}} there would be a school {{shooting}} at St Eskils Gymnasium in Eskilstuna, Sweden, leading 1250 students and 50 teachers to be evacuated. A 21-year-old man was arrested after 4chan provided the police with the IP address of the poster. Police said that the suspect called it off as a joke, and they released him after they found no <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the threat was serious.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} widely practiced {{treatments}} for speech disorders associated with Parkinson's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT). Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve speech. Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as many of their daily living activities as possible. There have been few studies on the effectiveness of OT and their quality is poor, although there is some <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> it may improve motor skills and quality of life {{for the duration of the}} therapy.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford's {{relationship}} with organized labour was never easy. Historian L.G.

In 1908, Labour candidate Donald McNabb was elected in a Lethbridge by-election; the riding had previously been held by a Liberal.
