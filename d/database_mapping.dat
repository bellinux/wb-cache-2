2500|$|Redlands-based mapping company Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). Between 2001 and 2006, Lewis {{earmarked}} {{more than}} $90 million for ESRI projects that included defense intelligence {{systems such as}} <b>database</b> <b>mapping</b> to assist in rebuilding war-torn Iraq. Work included such efforts as building software that assesses the fire danger of the San Bernardino Mountains, helping move troops in the Iraq war, and assisting in reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina. From 1998-2003, the company also received another $60 million in defense contracts outside of those earmarks. [...] ESRI has paid Lowery's firm $320,000 since 1998. Jack Dangermond, the {{president and founder of}} ESRI, and his wife, Laura, have consistently been two of the top individual contributors to Lewis' campaign fund, giving a combined $13,900 between 2000 and 2005. The couple has donated a combined $32,900 to the campaign fund and Lewis' PAC since the 2000 election cycle. [...] In late June, ESRI became [...] "the first private company reported to be subpoenaed by investigators from the U.S Attorney's Office in Los Angeles." [...] On September 5, 2006, the Associated Press reported that federal investigators were looking into a donation of [...] of land to the city of Redlands by the owners of ESRI in 2001, land adjacent to the home of Lewis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Map</b> <b>databases</b> are {{integral}} to many ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) applications in navigation, traffic forecasting, and route planning. With the increasing deployment of ITS technology demands for accurate and complete digital <b>map</b> <b>databases</b> of the nation's road network are surging. The development {{and maintenance of}} high quality digital <b>map</b> <b>databases</b> is expensive and time-consuming. Database sharing will be a sensible approach whenever possible {{in order to reduce}} cost. In the US <b>map</b> <b>databases</b> are being produced by a variety of public agencies and private vendors. Quality and levels of accuracy vary depending on data sources and production procedures. Verifying the quality and accuracy of <b>map</b> <b>databases</b> for purposes of navigation is a pragmatic and important concern. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed a Truth-in-Labeling Standard (SAE document J 1663), the goal of which is to provide a consistent method for describing and comparing <b>map</b> <b>databases.</b> While the standard requires that database vendors provide a standardized label that lists basic database characteristics such as lineage, coverage, accuracy, content and scope of a database, there are currently no guidelines for feature representation (such as the layout of road intersections) in digital databases. Comparison of two different <b>map</b> <b>databases</b> reveals significant representational differences due to differences in precision of source material, data model and intended uses...|$|R

As image features are not noise-free, we carry out error analysis and use Kalman Filters to track the 3 D landmarks, resulting in a <b>database</b> <b>map</b> with landmark positional uncertainty. By matching a set of landmarks as a whole, our robot can localize itself globally based on the database containing landmarks of sucient distinctiveness.
