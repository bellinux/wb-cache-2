25|$|The {{simplest}} {{descriptions of}} diffraction {{are those in}} which the situation {{can be reduced to}} a two-dimensional problem. For water waves, this is already the case, as water waves propagate only {{on the surface of the}} water. For light, we can often neglect one dimension if the diffracting object extends in that direction over a distance far greater than the wavelength. In the case of light shining through small circular holes we will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account the full three-dimensional nature of the problem.|$|E
25|$|The minimum control speed (VMC) of an {{aircraft}} (specifically an airplane) is a V-speed that specifies the calibrated airspeed below which directional or lateral {{control of the}} aircraft {{can no longer be}} maintained, after the failure of one or more engines. The VMC only applies if at least one engine is still operative, and will depend on the stage of flight. Indeed, multiple VMCs have to be calculated for landing, air travel, and ground travel, and there are more still for aircraft with four or more engines. These are all included in the aircraft flight manual of all multi-engine aircraft. When design engineers are sizing an airplane's vertical tail and flight control surfaces, they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account the effect this will have on the airplane's minimum control speeds.|$|E
25|$|Suppose that a Brownian {{particle}} of mass M {{is surrounded}} by lighter particles of mass m which are traveling at a speed u. Then, reasons Smoluchowski, in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles, the velocity transmitted to the latter will be mu/M. This ratio is {{of the order of}} 10−7cm/s. But we also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> consideration that in a gas there will be more than 1016 collisions in a second, and even greater in a liquid where we expect that there will be 1020 collision in one second. Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle; others will tend to decelerate it. If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 108 to 1010 collisions in one second, then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10 and 1000cm/s. Thus, even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion, just as the ballot theorem predicts.|$|E

The new design will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> account proper seismic design techniques and parameters. When you go with the old-style buildings and old-style engineering you're looking for trouble so we're going to change it now." [...] Horst Indorf, a representative for permanent shelter issues from ASB, a German non-government organization, frowned on the use of iron structures in the city given its movement during an earthquake, saying [...] "The best architecture for this area is clay brick (with nets) but this means 80 to 90cm thick walls and a very good insulated roof".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{all this}} research, there were {{relatively}} few recordings {{available to the}} general public. This changed in 1998, when Hermann Max conducted a CD of Graupner works on the CPO label. Montreal harpsichordist Geneviève Soly came across a Graupner manuscript in the Beinecke Library at Yale University in the year 2000 and started performing and recording his works. Graupner was [...] "always {{on the cutting edge}} for his time and very innovative in his ideas for harmony, notation, and the use of instruments," [...] as Soly has noted. [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>into</b> consideration his various styles in relation to the actual period and the ideas he was interested in developing at that moment. The size of the catalogue imposes added difficulties in this respect, because another composer might have written for just as long, but in one style only. Mozart comes to mind: although he composed over a shorter period, his style was always well defined." ...|$|E
