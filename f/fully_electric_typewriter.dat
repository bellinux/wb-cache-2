50|$|George Blickensderfer's {{invention}} dramatically {{reduced the}} complexity of the typewriter design. A typical Blick contained only 250 parts, compared to the 2,500 parts of a standard typewriter. It was much smaller, lighter and cheaper than others. Some of the first aluminum typewriters, marketed as the Blickensderfer 6 and the Blick Featherweight, were made by Blickensderfer, as was the world's first <b>fully</b> <b>electric</b> <b>typewriter,</b> the Blickensderfer Electric.|$|E
50|$|The Flexowriter {{can trace}} its roots {{to some of}} the {{earliest}} <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters.</b> In 1925, the Remington Typewriter Company wanted to expand their offerings to include <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters.</b> Having little expertise or manufacturing ability with electrical appliances, they partnered with Northeast Electric Company of Rochester and made a production run of 2500 <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters.</b> When the time came to make more units, Remington was suffering a management vacuum and could not complete contract negotiations, so Northeast began work on their own <b>electric</b> <b>typewriter.</b> In 1929, they started selling the Electromatic.|$|R

2500|$|In 1928, Delco, a {{division}} of General Motors, purchased Northeast <b>Electric,</b> and the <b>typewriter</b> business was spun off as Electromatic Typewriters, Inc. In 1933, Electromatic was acquired by IBM, which then spent [...] on a redesign of the Electromatic Typewriter, launching the IBM <b>Electric</b> <b>Typewriter</b> Model 01 in 1935.

50|$|In 1923 the Northeast Electric Company of Rochester, New York {{entered into}} a {{contract}} with Smathers {{for the production of}} <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters.</b> Northeast was interested in finding new markets for their electric motors and developed Smathers' design so that it could be marketed to typewriter manufacturers, and from 1925 Remington <b>Electric</b> <b>typewriters</b> were produced powered by Northeast's motors.|$|R
5000|$|The IBM <b>Electric</b> <b>typewriters</b> were {{a series}} of <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters</b> that IBM manufactured, {{starting}} in the mid-1930s. They used the conventional moving carriage and typebar mechanism, {{as opposed to the}} fixed carriage and type ball used in the IBM Selectric, introduced in 1961. After 1944, each model came in both Standard and Executive versions, the latter featuring proportional spacing.|$|R

25|$|Although <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters</b> {{would not}} achieve {{widespread}} popularity until {{nearly a century}} later, the basic groundwork for the <b>electric</b> <b>typewriter</b> was laid by the Universal Stock Ticker, invented by Thomas Edison in 1870.

25|$|The IBM Selectric {{typewriter}} was {{a highly}} successful model line of <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters</b> introduced by IBM on 31 July 1961.|$|R
50|$|A {{heavy duty}} <b>electric</b> <b>typewriter</b> was {{provided}} for the Occupational Therapy Department and proved so useful that a second one was added in 1970.|$|R
50|$|After the war, {{the company}} {{concentrated}} on making its typewriters more convenient and efficient {{for use in}} business offices. Typewriter sales peaked after World War II; {{in response to a}} demand for typewriters capable of faster output, Smith Corona introduced <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters</b> in 1955. <b>Electric</b> portables, intended for traveling writers and business people, but later widely purchased for general home use, were introduced in 1957. The new portable <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters</b> would become an essential tool for generations of U.S. high school and college students.|$|R
25|$|In 1931, an <b>electric</b> <b>typewriter</b> was {{introduced}} by Varityper Corporation. It was called the Varityper, because a narrow cylinder-like wheel could be replaced to change the font.|$|R
50|$|Soviet {{embassies}} used manual <b>typewriters,</b> {{rather than}} <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters,</b> for classified information—apparently {{because they are}} immune to such bugs.As of 2013, Russian special services still use typewriters.|$|R

50|$|Around 1974, Crouwel was {{commissioned}} by typewriter manufacturer Olivetti to design a typeface for their new <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters.</b> The result was a sans serif monoline (all lines are of equal thickness) typeface. Olivetti called it Politene. All characters {{are based on a}} square grid, with the 45-degree corners. Before Crouwel could finish the design, the interest for <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters</b> declined, so much so that they did not need the type design anymore. As a consequence, the copyrights of the design went back to Crouwel. At the same time they commissioned Crouwel, they asked Josef Müller-Brockmann to design a typeface as well.|$|R
5000|$|IBM {{experimented with}} several {{accessories}} and enhancements for its <b>electric</b> <b>typewriter.</b> In 1942, IBM filed a patent {{application for a}} typewriter that could print justified and proportionally spaced text. This required recording each line of text on a paper tape before it was printed. [...] IBM experimented with a 12-hole paper tape compatible with their punched-card code.Eventually, IBM settled on a 6-hole encoding, as documented in their automatic justifying typewriter patents filed in 1945. [...] Equipping an <b>electric</b> <b>typewriter</b> with both a paper-tape reader and punch created the basic foundation for {{what would become the}} Flexowriter.|$|R
50|$|Eventually Wharton {{considered}} publishing {{his writing}} and, after buying an <b>electric</b> <b>typewriter</b> with {{a grant from}} the Australia Council for the Arts, he wrote his first book of poems, Kings with Empty Pockets.|$|R
2500|$|Dry {{correction}} products (such as correction paper) under {{brand names}} such as [...] "Ko-Rec-Type" [...] were introduced in the 1970s and functioned like white carbon paper. A strip of the product was placed over the letters needing correction, and the incorrect letters were retyped, causing the black character to be overstruck with a white overcoat. Similar material was soon incorporated in carbon-film <b>electric</b> <b>typewriter</b> ribbons; like the traditional two-color black-and-red inked ribbon common on manual typewriters, {{a black and white}} correcting ribbon became commonplace on <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters.</b> But the black or white coating could be partly rubbed off with handling, so such corrections were generally not acceptable in legal documents.|$|R
50|$|The Friden Flexowriter was a teleprinter, a {{heavy-duty}} <b>electric</b> <b>typewriter</b> {{capable of being}} driven not only by a human typing, but also automatically by several methods, including direct attachment to a computer and by use of paper tape.|$|R
5000|$|Before computers, on <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters</b> the [...] "Return" [...] key {{was kept}} {{comparatively}} large. This {{is due to}} the frequency of usage (which also includes the space bar), and therefore, is kept large to reduce the likelihood of finger slips.|$|R
25|$|Selectrics {{and their}} {{descendants}} eventually captured 75 percent of the United States market for <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters</b> used in business. IBM replaced the Selectric line with the IBM Wheelwriter in 1984 and transferred its typewriter business to the newly formed Lexmark in 1991.|$|R
50|$|After Davis' {{death in}} 1904, his son, Thurber P. Davis, left the University of Michigan {{to take over}} the {{management}} of Davis Business College. Under the leadership of the younger Davis, <b>electric</b> <b>typewriters</b> were added. Stenotype and data processing augmented the expanding curriculum.|$|R

5000|$|Courier is a {{monospaced}} {{slab serif}} typeface designed {{to resemble the}} output from a strike-on typewriter.

50|$|The 5250 is a block-oriented {{terminal}} {{similar to}} the IBM 3270 but is not compatible with the 3270. Robustly constructed, 5251 terminals weigh roughly 36 kg.

2500|$|The first <b>electric</b> <b>typewriter</b> was {{produced}} by the Blickensderfer Manufacturing Company, of Stamford, Connecticut, in 1902. Like the manual Blickensderfer typewriters, it used a cylindrical typewheel rather than individual typebars. It was not a commercial success, {{which may have been}} because at the time electricity had not been standardized and voltage differed from city to city. The next step {{in the development of the}} <b>electric</b> <b>typewriter</b> came in 1910, when Charles and Howard Krum filed a patent for the first practical teletypewriter. The Krums' machine, named the Morkrum Printing Telegraph, used a typewheel rather than individual typebars. [...] This machine was used for the first commercial teletypewriter system on Postal Telegraph Company lines between Boston and New York City in 1910.|$|R
