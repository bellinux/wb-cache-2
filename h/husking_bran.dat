40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to perform quantitative analysis and comparison of Nitrogen, Potassium and Phosphorus contents in rice <b>husk</b> and wheat <b>bran</b> samples. Rice and wheat are leading staple food and are cultivated in Pakistan at large scale. During refining process the rick <b>husk</b> and wheat <b>bran</b> are removed from rice and wheat grains. Both rice <b>husk</b> and wheat <b>bran</b> contain nutrients in specific proportion, that’s why these can be used effectively for different purposes such as soil amendment and organic fertilizer to retain yield and increase soil fertility. In this study the detection of Nitrogen in rice <b>husk</b> and wheat <b>bran</b> samples was done by using elemental analyzer, Potassium detection was done by using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer and Phosphorus was detected by using X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry. The result of this study shows that rice husk contains more Nitrogen (0. 476 ± 0. 0687) and Phosphorus (0. 0504 ± 0. 007211) contents as compared to wheat bran (0. 410 ± 0. 0679) and (0. 0101 ± 0. 00387) respectively. However in wheat bran, Potassium content (26. 706 ± 2. 47) was slightly higher than rice husk (25. 986 ± 1. 573). It can be concluded that rice husk contains comparatively more nutrient value as eco-friendly organic fertilizer than wheat bran...|$|R
50|$|The germ of a cereal is the {{reproductive}} part that germinates {{to grow into}} a plant; it is the embryo of the seed. Along with bran, germ is often a by-product of the milling that produces refined grain products. Cereal grains and their components, such as wheat germ oil, rice bran oil, and maize, {{may be used as}} a source from which vegetable oil is extracted, or used directly as a food ingredient. The germ is retained {{as an integral part of}} whole-grain foods. Non-whole grain methods of milling are intended to isolate the endosperm, which is ground into flour, with removal of both the <b>husk</b> (<b>bran)</b> and the germ. Removal of bran is aimed at producing a flour with a white rather than a brown color, and eliminating fiber, which reduces nutrition. The germ is rich in polyunsaturated fats (which have a tendency to oxidize and become rancid on storage) and so germ removal improves the storage qualities of flour.|$|R
40|$|Arsenic (As) {{contamination}} of rice grains and the generally low concentration of micronutrients in rice {{have been recognized}} as a major concern for human health. Here, we investigated the speciation and localization of As {{and the distribution of}} (micro) nutrients in rice grains because these are key factors controlling bioavailability of nutrients and contaminants. Bulk total and speciation analyses using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) -inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) was complemented by spatially resolved microspectroscopic techniques (mu-XANES, mu-X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF) and particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE)) to investigate both speciation and distribution of As and localization of nutrients in situ. The distribution of As and micronutrients varied between the various parts of the grains (<b>husk,</b> <b>bran</b> and endosperm) and was characterized by element-specific distribution patterns. The speciation of As in bran and endosperm was dominated by As(III) -thiol complexes. The results indicate that the translocation from the maternal to filial tissues may be a bottleneck for As accumulation in the grain. Strong similarities between the distribution of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and phosphorus (P) and between zinc (Zn) and sulphur (S) may be indicative of complexation mechanisms in rice grains...|$|R

40|$|Paddy rice {{has been}} likened to nictiana sp {{in its ability}} to {{scavenge}} cadmium (Cd) from soil, whereas arsenic (As) accumulation is commonly an order of magnitude higher than in other cereal crops. In areas such as those found in parts of Hunan province in south central China, base-metal mining activities and rice farming coexist. Therefore there is a considerable likelihood that lead (Pb), in addition to Cd and As, will accumulate in rice grown in parts of this region above levels suitable for human consumption. To test this hypothesis, a widespread provincial survey of rice from mine spoilt paddies (n = 100), in addition to a follow-up market grain survey (n = 122) conducted in mine impacted areas was undertaken to determine the safety of local rice supply networks. Furthermore, a specific Cd, As, and Pb biogeochemical survey of paddy soil and rice was conducted within southern China, targeting sites impacted by mining of varying intensities to calibrate rice metal(loid) transfer models and transfer factors {{that can be used to}} predict tissue loading. Results revealed a number of highly significant correlations between shoot, <b>husk,</b> <b>bran,</b> and endosperm rice tissue fractions and that rice from mining areas was enriched in Cd, As, and Pb. Sixty-five, 50, and 34 % of all the mine-impacted field rice was predicted to fail national food standards for Cd, As, and Pb, respectively. Although, not as elevated as the grains from the mine-impacted field survey, 4 was demonstrated that metal(loid) tainted rice was entering food supply chains intended for direct human consumption...|$|R

In this experiment four levels of nitrogen fertilizer (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N ha - 1 from urea source) and four levels of potassium fertilizer (0, 75, 150 and 225 kg K 2 O ha - 1 from potassium sulfate source) have been applied using a split factorial design with 3 replications. Nitrogen fertilizer have been applied in three stages (1 / 3 in transplanting stage, 1 / 3 in tillering stage and finally 1 / 3 in flowering initiation stage) and potassium fertilizer have been applied in two stages (1 / 2 in transplanting stage and 1 / 2 in shooting stage). Results showed that application of nitrogen cause an increase in amount of bran production and have shown significant effects on percentages of bran, head and brewers rice, husking efficiency and transformation degree. However, potassium application has increased percent of <b>bran</b> and <b>husking</b> efficiency and has decrease percentages of brewers rice and has not demonstrated significant effects on percentages of husk, head rice and transformation degree. Furthermore, simultaneous application of nitrogen and potassium in Tarrom genotype has not shown significantly effects on percentages of husk, head and brewers rice and transformation degree.

Moreover, production medium {{has a significant}} impact on the attributes of resulting propagules, such as biocontrol efficacy, desiccation tolerance, and persistence of fungal pathogens. This study optimized various agricultural by-products as substrate medium in SSF study in expectation of their utilization in mass multiplication of ENPF, B. bassiana. Several of the agricultural wastes; such as rice <b>husk,</b> wheat <b>bran</b> and tea waste supported excellent sporulation in B. bassiana, showing potentiality to be used as substrate of choice for mass production of this fungi. Addition of nutrient supplements to the substrates showed slight (pongamia seed cake) to significant (rice husk, tea leaf waste) increase in spore production, revealing further possibility of improvement in SSF output.

40|$|The present review {{deals with}} {{parameters}} influencing the rice breakage during rice milling operations {{and the effect}} of rubber roll Sheller in rice husk removal process. The main objective of rice milling system is to remove the <b>husk</b> and <b>bran</b> layer to produce the white rice. In this process, rubber roll sheller is used to remove husk from the grains by friction process. If the rubber material is too soft, there may not be sufficient shear force to husk the paddy.

Hence, for efficient husking the rubber roll material should possess the balance of physico-mechanical properties. Rice breakage depends on several other parameters like the type of harvest, drying temperature, drying methods, physical characteristics of paddy, husking characteristics, paddy moisture content, rubber roller speed, rubber roll pressure, paddy feed rate and fissures.

30|$|With current {{scientific}} {{focus on}} functional foods and functional ingredients, {{the contribution of}} edible fungi to this category of foods has been investigated. Edible fungi are cultured in media that usually consist of sawdust, cottonseed <b>husk,</b> wheat <b>bran,</b> and other substances. They also contain lignocelluloses, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, which can induce edible fungi to secrete cellulose, hemicellulose, and other extracellular hydrolases (Huai-Liang 2010; Lechner and Papinutti 2006; Rani et al. 2008). Lignocellulolytic enzymes are carbohydrate-active enzymes that perform important roles in the carbohydrate metabolism of organisms. Lignocellulolytic enzyme secretion during the fermentation of edible fungi is a necessary physiological function for the transformation of lignocellulolytic matrix during fungal growth (Elisashvili et al. 2002). Therefore, the decomposition degree and efficiency of edible fungi can be understood by detecting the extracellular enzyme activities of edible fungi under different conditions to provide a rapid and enhanced environment for hyphal and sporophore growth. We could understand the trend {{of changes in the}} extracellular enzyme activities of edible fungi from the aspect of edible fungal growth. As such, we can further explore the pharmacological activity of edible fungi and improve cultivation techniques.|$|R

Addition of biochars from rice residues (straw, <b>husk,</b> and <b>bran)</b> significantly decreased shoot Cd, Zn, and Pb concentrations by up to 71 %, 37 %, and 60 %, respectively, but increased As by up to 199 %. Biochar additions decreased the NH 4 NO 3 -extractable concentrations of Cd, Zn, and Pb in soil by 23 to 81 %, 29 to 94 %, and 31 to 92 %, respectively, especially straw-char treatment, though biochar treatment increased the concentration of As by 64 to 2650 %. A decrease in biochar particle size generally favored the immobilization of Cd, Zn, and Pb in soil and reductions in their accumulation in wheat shoot, but this was reversed for As. Increases of up to 21 %, 70 %, 59 %, and 40 % in shoot biomass, root length, and shoot P and K levels, respectively, of wheat seedlings were caused by biochar amendments.

Rice shoot concentrations of Cd, Zn and Pb decreased by up to 98 %, 83 % and 72 %, respectively, due to biochar amendment, though that of As increased by up to 327 %. Biochar amendments significantly decreased pore water concentrations (C-pw) of Cd and Zn and increased that of As. For Pb it depended on the amendment. Porewater pH, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved phosphorus, silicon in pore water and iron plaque formation on root surfaces all increased significantly after the amendments. The proportions of Cd and Pb in iron plaque increased by factors 1. 8 - 5. 7 and 1. 4 - 2. 8, respectively; no increase was observed for As and Zn. Straw-char application significantly and noticeably decreased the plant transfer coefficients of Cd and Pb. This study, the first to investigate changes in metal mobility and iron plaque formation in rice plants due to amending a historically contaminated soil with biochar, indicates that biochar has a potential to decrease Cd, Zn and Pb accumulations in rice shoot but increase that of As.

A higher sugar yield was obtained with the addition of small amounts of sulphuric acid, although only the pretreatment conditions without the addition of acid were optimised for starch-free fibres A and B. The highest sugar yields obtained after hydrolysis of starch-free bran, starch-free fibres A, starch-free fibres B and barley husk corresponded to 80 %, 69 % 87 % and 68 % of the theoretical, respectively. The hydrolysates from starch-free <b>bran</b> and barley <b>husks</b> showed no inhibition in fermentability tests. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation with S. cerevisiae of a 10 % total DM steam-pretreated barley husk resulted in 81 % of the theoretical ethanol yield, corresponding to 71 % of the ethanol yield based on carbohydrate composition. The use of the wheat fibres and the wheat bran in the combined starch and ethanol factory would increase the ethanol yield in 25 and 20 %, respectively. Utilisation of the husk fraction in plants producing ethanol from barley grain could increase the ethanol yield by more than 10 %...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{production}} of short-chain fatty acids and ammonia {{was measured in}} 16. 6 % fecal homogenates from 50 subjects incubated at 37 &deg;C for 6 and 24 hours. All 50 homoge-nates produced ammonia and short-chain fatty acids of any chain length (C 2 -C 5). Incubation for 24 hours with dietary fiber (ispaghula <b>husk</b> or wheat <b>bran),</b> albumin, or glucose (10 mg/ mL) increased the short-chain fatty acid production (43. 6 &plusmn; 2. 8, 45. 4 &plusmn; 2. 0, 60. 3 &plusmn; 3. 2, and 65. 8 &plusmn; 3. 1 mmol/L, respectively) compared with controls (21. 4 &plusmn; 1. 3 mmol/L). The degradation of different substrates {{was associated with the}} {{production of}} different amounts of ammonia and short-chain fatty acids. Ispaghula, wheat bran, albumin, and glucose were fermented to acetate (> 2 mmol/L; 24 -hour incubations) in 86 %, 96 %, 98 %, and 98 % of the homogenates, to propionate in 80 %, 76 %, 100 %, and 68 %, and to butyrate in 32 %, 94 %, 88 %, and 54 % of th...|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{assessment}} of value of irrigation water used in paddy field and cost of irrigation water services in Sam Chuk O&M project, Suphan Buri province, Central part of Thailand. Specifically, the study involves primary and secondary data collection from the study site related to production cost of rice farmers, yield of rice production, climates, soil type, crop calendar, and the rice marketing channel system of Suphan Buri province. The amount of irrigation water applied in paddy field was used CROPWAT 8. 0 model in estimation then used this amount to calculate the value of irrigation water using the Residual Imputation Method (RIM). Results show that the average value of irrigation water had contributed into 2 cases. For case without government subsidy, the value of irrigation water is 0. 017 US$/m 3 and 0. 019 US$/m 3 for dry and wet season, respectively. For case with government subsidy, the value of irrigation water is 0. 033 US$/m 3 and 0. 045 US$/m 3 for dry and wet season, respectively. In addition, the cost of irrigation project was based on Sam Chuk O&M project investment. Results show that {{the average cost of}} irrigation water service per area is 140. 95 US$/ha/year or in form the mass unit of paddy production is 13. 063 US$/ton and 13. 477 US$/ton for dry and wet season, respectively. Moreover, the added value of paddy production is considered at the primary milling process that consisted brown rice <b>bran,</b> <b>husk,</b> white rice <b>bran</b> and broken white rice. In addition, milling process of white rice 1 ton had used the material production or paddy 2 tons. Therefore, the added value of by-product from milling process is 138. 433 US$/ton. Moreover, the total paddy production for each season is around 50 % that is 940, 000 tons and 950, 000 tons for dry and wet season, respectively. Therefore, 90 % of white rice production in Suphan Buri province is selling to export market and another 10 % is selling to domestic market. In conclude the new finance irrigation service to cover irrigation water service and maintenance costs is provided by 4 scenarios from the output that mention above. This is only scenario of sharing cost of irrigation water service. In addition, there are needs supporting from the related institutional offices. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: From August 2009 to October 2010, International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh and the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research {{together}} investigated 14 {{outbreaks of}} anthrax which included 140 animal and 273 human cases in 14 anthrax-affected villages. Our investigation objectives were {{to explore the}} context in which these outbreaks occurred, including livestock rearing practices, human handling of sick and dead animals, and the anthrax vaccination program. Methods: Field anthropologists used qualitative data-collection tools, including 15 hours of unstructured observations, 11 key informant interviews, 32 open-ended interviews, and 6 group discussions in 5 anthrax-affected villages. Results: Each cattle owner in the affected communities raised a median of six ruminants on their household premises. The ruminants were often grazed in pastures and fed supplementary rice straw, green grass, water hyacinth, rice <b>husk,</b> wheat <b>bran,</b> and oil cake; lactating cows were given dicalcium phosphate. Cattle represented a major financial investment. Since Islamic law forbids eating animals that die from natural causes, when anthrax-infected cattle were moribund, farmers often slaughtered them on the household premises while they were still alive so that the meat could be eaten. Farmers ate the meat and sold it to neighbors. Skinners removed and sold the hides from discarded carcasses. Farmers discarded the carcasses and slaughtering waste into ditches, bodies of water, or open fields. Cattle in the affected communities did not receive routine anthrax vaccine due to low production, poor distribution, and limited staffing for vaccination. Conclusion: Slaughtering anthrax-infected animals and disposing of butchering waste and carcasses in environments where ruminants live and graze, combined with limited vaccination, provided a context that permitted repeated anthrax outbreaks in animals and humans. Because of strong financial incentives, slaughtering moribund animals and discarding carcasses and waste products will likely continue. Long-term vaccination coverage for at-risk animal populations may reduce anthrax infection...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{data shows}} that Portugal has a rice consume of 15. 8 kg/capita/year, {{the largest in}} Europe. The Sado estuary, located in the West Coast of Portugal, is a major area for rice {{production}} in Portugal. Although this area is partially classified as a natural reserve, it is also threatened by many sources of anthropogenic pressure and runoff from agriculture grounds, originating a moderately contaminated estuary in some hot-spot areas. The present work aims at evaluating the level of inorganic contaminants present in different rice varieties including whole grain, white rice, <b>husk</b> and <b>bran.</b> A total of 33 samples were obtained from Sado region and from distribution stores. Contents in manganese, copper, zinc, vanadium, chromium, cobalt, nickel, arsenic, selenium, strontium, cadmium and lead, were evaluated using an ICP-MS. Samples with the highest content of arsenic, were analyzed for arsenic speciation by coupling an HPLC to the ICP-MS. Samples were analyzed {{in compliance with the}} internal quality criteria established by the laboratory. In most samples levels of lead, cadmium, cobalt, and vanadium were below or near to the LOQ. Arsenic content varies between 98 and 250 µg/kg. Speciation data, showed that the species present were mainly arsenite (AsIII), representing about 80 % of total arsenic, and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). After comparing this data with other analytical results used in risk assessment studies we can infer that inorganic contaminants in samples are not a matter of concern. This study also shows the need of powerful analytical techniques with very low detection limits to measure inorganic contaminants in foods. This work was completed on behalf of project “ 23290 – ValCAP” funded by the Portuguese Innovation Agency (ADI) and project “ORQUE SUDOE”, Ref. SOE 3 /P 2 /F 591.

40|$|A multienzymatic complex {{production}} was evaluated, {{as well as}} endoglucanase and total cellulase characterization, during solid-state fermentation of rice industry wastes with Rhizopus oryzae CCT 7560 (newly isolated microorganism) and Trichoderma reesei QM 9414 (control). R. oryzae produced enzymes with higher activity at 15 h of fermentation (5. 1 and 2. 3 U g− 1 to endoglucanase and total cellulase), while T. reesei produced them at 55 h (15. 3 and 2. 8 U g− 1 to endoglucanase and total cellulase). The optimum temperature for total cellulase and endoglucanase was 60 °C. For Trichoderma and Rhizopus, the optimum pH was 5. 0 and 6. 0 for total cellulase and 6. 0 and 5. 0 for endoglucanase, respectively. The enzymes produced by Rhizopus presented higher stability at the temperature range evaluated (25 – 100 °C); the endoglucanase KM value was 20 times lower than the one found for Trichoderma. The characterization of the cellulolytic enzymes from the fungal species native of rice husk revealed {{that they can be}} more efficient than the genetically modified enzymes when rice <b>husk</b> and rice <b>bran</b> are used as substrates...|$|R
40|$|The {{report is}} {{structured}} as follows. Chapter 2 presents {{the background to}} this study. Based on secondary data, it first describes the rice milling sector to illustrate {{the characteristics of the}} sector and to establish the importance of small scale parboiling rice mills. No secondary data were available either on the socio-economic characteristics of the user group or on the attitudes to technological change among owners and operators of rice mills. This information was important to the design of the project methodology; for indicating the nature of technological improvements acceptable to user groups; for issues of affordability and for subsequent dissemination activities. Section 2. 3, draws on the baseline survey carried out in Phase 1, to analyse these characteristics. Chapter 3 first analyses the characteristics of the traditional furnace design and then demonstrates how the new design of furnace-boiler unit has increased combustion efficiency by more than the project objective; improved the working conditions of the workers and increased profitability of the owners. It also sets out the potentials and limitations for wider replications. Chapter 4 focuses on enhancing the production of briquettes using husk from parboiled rice. It describes the current procedures used for briquette production, the difficulties of using husk of parboiled rice, and the improvements developed by this project to address these constraints. Chapter 5 discusses the wider socio-economic benefits that could be generated by the rice <b>husk</b> and <b>bran</b> saved by improved combustion efficiency. It also shows that briquettes, where available, have become the poor man's fuel. Chapter 6 initially set out the characteristics of the rice husk ash in Bangladesh. It then describes the current uses in other countries and identifies potential alternative uses in Bangladesh. Chapter 7 describes the dissemination activities already undertaken and their outcomes and then outlines further dissemination activities that could potentially enhance uptake. Chapter 8 will conclude the report with recommendations and identify further research needs in biomass fuel use...|$|R
40|$|Pesticides {{are used}} to prevent pests from attacking grains in order to {{preserve}} the crops. This paper aims at evaluating the distribution of the pesticides bispyribac-sodium, carbofuran, clomazone and tebuconazole in different fractions of milled rice (white rice, rice <b>bran,</b> <b>husked</b> rice, parboiled rice, parboiled rice <b>bran,</b> and <b>husked</b> parboiled rice) which is planted on experimental fields under controlled conditions. The QuEChERS method was adapted to the extraction of pesticides and validated by using HPLC-DAD for quantification and LC-MS for confirmation. The analytical method of extracting pesticides, as well as the chromatographic conditions for identification and quantification, were suitable, according to certain efficiency indicators: 0. 07 mg kg- 1 LOD and 0. 2 mg kg- 1 LOQ for the mixture of pesticides and rice and rice bran recoveries of 119 and 116 %, 84 and 119 %, 113 and 96 %, 103 and 97 % for carbofuran, bispyribac-sodium, clomazone and tebuconazole, respectively. The method under development was applied to rice fractions: bran had the highest residue concentration of the studied pesticides, when compared to milled rice, showing 8. 0, 2. 3, 2. 2 and 1. 6 times more contamination, in average, with tebuconazole, clomazone, carbofuran and bispyribac-sodium, respectively. Only clomazone and tebuconazole were in the acceptable limits established by Codex Alimentarius (0. 1 mg kg- 1) for milled rice...|$|R
