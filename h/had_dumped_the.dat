5|$|While {{under house}} arrest, Bhimsen smuggled {{a letter to}} the Resident Hodgson {{appealing}} him to intervene on his behalf, which Hodgson refused at that moment, but sought permission from his superiors to do so. Meanwhile, Bhimsen's third wife, Bhakta Kumari, happened to insult the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi, who upon hearing about this insult, was so angered that she order Bhakta Kumari to be removed from Bagh Durbar and put in a common jail. After this, a rumor started to spread around Kathmandu that Bhakta Kumari would be stripped off her clothes and paraded through the streets of the city. This rumor also fell on Bhimsen's ears; and unable to bear such indignity, Bhimsen attempted suicide by slitting his throat with a khukuri on 28 July 1839. The news of this attempted suicide further angered the King and the Queen, who came to look at his body, and instead of feeling sympathy for the old minister and ordering immediate medical care, Bhimsen's blood soaked, unconscious body was ordered that same day to be dragged through the streets and dumped by the same bank of Bishnumati river, where Bhimsen <b>had</b> <b>dumped</b> <b>the</b> dead bodies of 45 people 33 years ago during the Bhandarkhal massacre. Bhimsen finally died nine days later, surrounded by vultures, jackals, and dogs, on 5 August 1939, at the age of 64. Since suicide was considered a grave crime, soldiers were stationed at his death spot so that his body would not be removed and given ordinary cremation rites; and his body was allowed to be devoured by scavenging animals. On the spot where Bhimsen drew his last breath, a Shiva temple by the name Bhim-Mukteshowr was later constructed by his nephew Mathabar Singh Thapa.|$|E

25|$|Harris {{revealed}} {{the existence of}} the group to the police, and told them of a homicide that did not make the papers; it was that of a homeless man whom they had kidnapped from Ghirardelli Square. They had brought the man to Black Self-Help Moving's warehouse, gagged and tied him up, and while he was still conscious, took turns hacking away his limbs. Harris told the detectives that they <b>had</b> <b>dumped</b> <b>the</b> body into the bay. He told his story in such detail that the police were convinced of its veracity, especially since the police had, on the previous December 24, recovered the bound and badly butchered torso of a male, missing its hands, feet and head, that had washed up in the city's Ocean Beach district at the foot of Pacheco Street. Harris provided the police with names, dates, addresses and details — enough information to issue arrest warrants against the suspects. Harris subsequently sought, and received, immunity for his help in breaking the Zebra case, as well as new identities for himself, his girlfriend, and her child.|$|E

50|$|As {{the penguin}} refuses food from humans it is {{unlikely}} to survive {{more than a few days}} away from its parents. The zoo initially offered a reward of £1,000, which was swelled by additional offers of money from around the world (including $600 from America). Zoo staff speculated that the film March of the Penguins may have inspired the crime. By Thursday, hopes of finding Toga alive were fading. There was also a caller to the morning television programme GMTV claiming to <b>have</b> <b>dumped</b> <b>the</b> body of Toga in Portsmouth Harbour.|$|R
60|$|I {{shouted the}} words to Audrey {{in the act of}} {{snatching}} up the Nugget and starting to run. She understood. She did not hesitate {{in the direction of the}} house for even the instant which might have undone us, but was with me at once; and we were across the open space and in the stable-yard before the first of the men in the drive loomed up through the darkness. Half of the wooden double-gate of the yard was open, and the other half served us as a shield. They fired as they ran--at random, I think, for it was too dark for them to have seen us clearly--and two bullets slapped against the gate. A third struck the wall above our heads and ricocheted off into the night. But before they could fire again we were in the stables, the door slammed behind us, and I <b>had</b> <b>dumped</b> <b>the</b> Nugget on the floor, and was shooting the heavy bolts into their places. Footsteps clattered over the flagstones and stopped outside. Some weighty body plunged against the door. Then there was silence. The first round was over.|$|E

40|$|Margin Call, {{which starts}} {{screening}} this week, {{is a reminder}} that finance is both necessary and dangerous, writes John Quiggin in Inside Story • THE plot of Margin Call is simple, in fact minimal.

We see the outcome of this rescue bid as the film draws to a close. The tension in this understated but compelling movie arises from {{the fact that most of}} the participants face the possibility that their careers are over, either because the firm no longer needs them, or because the trading partners on whom they <b>have</b> <b>dumped</b> <b>the</b> assets will never trust them again… Read the full article Photo: Susan Blackwell as HR manager Lauren Bratberg in Margin Call...|$|R

50|$|In 1911 two miners, David Pugh and James Hart, {{were hired}} to mine for bat guano {{from the cave}} {{to be used as}} fertilizer. They removed a layer of guano {{estimated}} to be three to six feet deep and weighing about 250 tons.

The miners were aware of the artifacts but only the most interesting specimens were saved.

Loud of the Paleontology Department at the University of California was contacted by the mining company when the refuse left by the ancient people proved so plentiful that fertilizer could no longer be collected.|$|E
