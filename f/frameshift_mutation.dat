5|$|W5 {{is found}} in Thoroughbreds {{descending}} from Puchilingui, a 1984 stallion with sabino-like white spotting and roaning. Horses with the W5 allele exhibit a huge range in white phenotype: a few have been pure white or near-white, while others have sabino-like spotting limited to high, irregular stockings and blazes that covered the face. Twenty-two members of this family were studied, and the 12 {{with some degree of}} dominant white spotting were found to have a deletion in exon 15 (p.T732QfsX9), {{in the form of a}} <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutation.</b> A later study found that the members of this family with the greatest depigmentation were compound heterozygotes who also carried the W20 allele.|$|E

The nucleotide sequence of the suspected gene is provided from published gene sequences or from cloning and sequencing of the suspect gene. The amino acid sequence encoded by the gene is then predicted.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the rules}} that govern the genetic code and the various {{mechanisms}} present in a cell to ensure the correct transfer of genetic information {{during the process of}} DNA replication as well as during translation, mutations do occur; <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutation</b> is not the only type. There are at least two other types of recognized point mutations, specifically missense mutation and nonsense mutation. A <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutation</b> can drastically change the coding capacity (genetic information) of the message. Small insertions or deletions (those less than 20 base pairs) make up 24% of mutations that manifest in currently recognized genetic disease.|$|E

25|$|Several {{diseases}} have <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> as {{at least}} part of the cause. Knowing prevalent mutations can also aid in the diagnosis of the disease. Currently there are attempts to use <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> beneficially in the treatment of diseases, changing the reading frame of the amino acids.|$|R
25|$|<b>Frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> {{can occur}} {{randomly}} or {{be caused by}} an external stimulus. The detection of <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> can occur via several different methods.

25|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} is {{the most}} common cause of sudden death in young people, including trained athletes, and is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins of the cardiac sarcomere. Mutations in the Troponin C gene (TNNC1) are a rare genetic cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A recent study has indicated that a <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutation</b> (c.363dupG or p.Gln122AlafsX30) in Troponin C was the cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (and sudden cardiac death) in a 19-year-old male.|$|E
25|$|A <b>frameshift</b> <b>{{mutation}}</b> is a mutation {{caused by}} insertion or deletion {{of a number}} of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a DNA sequence. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, the insertion or deletion can disrupt the reading frame, or the grouping of the codons, resulting in a completely different translation from the original. The earlier in the sequence the deletion or insertion occurs, the more altered the protein produced is.|$|E
25|$|Recently, two {{damaging}} de novo NAA15 mutations {{were reported}} by exome sequencing in parent-offspring trios with congenital heart disease. Patient 1 harbors a <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutation</b> (p.Lys335fs) and displays heterotaxy (dextrocardia, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, left superior vena cava, hypoplastic TV, double outlet right ventricle, hypoplastic RV, D-transposition of the great arteries, pulmonic stenosis) and hydronephrosis, asplenia, malrotation and abnormal neuro-development, the second patient harbors a nonsense mutation (p.S761X) and displays conotruncal defects (tetralogy of Fallot, single left coronary artery).|$|E
2500|$|Frameshifting {{may also}} occur during {{prophase}} translation, producing different proteins from overlapping open reading frames, {{such as the}} gag-pol-env retroviral proteins. This is fairly common in viruses and also occurs in bacteria and yeast (Farabaugh, 1996). Reverse transcriptase, as opposed to RNA Polymerase II, {{is thought to be}} a stronger cause of the occurrence of <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations.</b> In experiments only 3–13% of all <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> occurred because of RNA Polymerase II.

25|$|The {{mutations}} {{found in}} EEC are missense mutations, meaning {{that there is}} a single amino acid change in the protein, as opposed to premature termination of protein synthesis, known as a nonsense mutation. The <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutation</b> introduces a premature stop codon that affected the α isotope, but does not affect the β and γ isotopes of p63. From this, it can be concluded that mutant p63α isotopes seem {{to play a major role}} in the pathogenesis of EEC syndrome. Interestingly, it seems that p63α is the predominant p63 isotope in epithelial basal cell layers, which are the cell type often associated with the anomalies found in patients with EEC syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Sanger {{sequencing}} and pyrosequencing are {{two methods}} {{that have been}} used to detect frameshift mutations, however, it is likely that data generated will not be of the highest quality. Even still, 1.96 million indels have been identified through Sanger sequencing that do not overlap with other databases. When a <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutation</b> is observed it is compared against the Human Genome Mutation Database (HGMD) to determine if the mutation has a damaging effect. This is done by looking at four features. First, the ratio between the affected and conserved DNA, second the location of the mutation relative to the transcript, third the ratio of conserved and affected amino acids and finally the distance of the indel {{to the end of the}} exon.|$|E
25|$|Frameshift {{mutations}} {{are found}} to be more common in repeat regions of DNA. A reason for this is because of slipping of the polymerase enzyme in repeat regions, allowing for mutations to enter the sequence. Experiments can be run to determine the frequency of the <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutation</b> by adding or removing a pre-set number of nucleotides. Experiments have been run by adding four basepairs, called the +4 experiments, but a team from Emory University looked at the difference in frequency of the mutation by both adding and deleting a base pair. It was shown that {{there was no difference in}} the frequency between the addition and deletion of a base pair. There is however, a difference in the end result of the protein.|$|E
5|$|Mutations that {{disrupt the}} reading frame {{sequence}} by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases {{are known as}} <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations.</b> These mutations usually result {{in a completely different}} translation from the original, and likely cause a stop codon to be read, which truncates the protein. These mutations may impair the protein's function and are thus rare in in vivo protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> is rare is that, if the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism faces, absence of a functional protein may cause death before the organism becomes viable. <b>Frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease.|$|R

25|$|CCR5 {{is one of}} {{the cell}} entry co-factors {{associated}} with HIV, most frequently involved with nonsyncytium-inducing strains, is most apparent in HIV patients as opposed to AIDS patients. A 32 base pair deletion in CCR5 has been identified as a mutation that negates the likelihood of an HIV infection. This region on the open reading frame ORF contains a <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutation</b> leading to a premature stop codon. This leads to the loss of the HIV-coreceptor function in vitro. CCR5-1 is considered the wild type and CCR5-2 is considered to be the mutant allele. Those with a heterozygous mutation for the CCR5 were less susceptible to the development of HIV. In a study, despite high exposure to the HIV virus, there was no one homozygous for the CCR5 mutation that tested positive for HIV.|$|E
25|$|Frameshift {{mutations}} {{are known}} to be a factor in colorectal cancer as well as other cancers with microsatellite instability. As stated previously, frameshift mutations are more likely to occur in a region of repeat sequence. When DNA mismatch repair does not fix the addition or deletion of bases, these mutations {{are more likely to be}} pathogenic. This may be in part because the tumor is not told to stop growing. Experiments in yeast and bacteria help to show characteristics of microsatellites that may contribute to defective DNA mismatch repair. These include the length of the microsatellite, the makeup of the genetic material and how pure the repeats are. Based on experimental results longer microsatellites have a higher rate of frameshift mutations. The flanking DNA can also contribute to frameshift mutations. In prostate cancer a <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutation</b> changes the open reading frame (ORF) and prevents apoptosis from occurring. This leads to an unregulated growth of the tumor. While there are environmental factors that contribute to the progression of prostate cancer, there is also a genetic component. During testing of coding regions to identify mutations, 116 genetic variants were discovered, including 61 frameshift mutations. There are over 500 mutations on chromosome 17 that seem to play a role in the development of breast and ovarian cancer in the BRCA1 gene, many of which are frameshift.|$|E
500|$|W10 {{was found}} in a study of 27 horses in a family of American Quarter Horses, 10 of which are white or spotted and 17 that were solid and non-white. The 10 family members with W10 had a {{deletion}} in exon 7 (c.1126_1129delGAAC). Like W5, a wide range of phenotypes were observed. The most modestly marked had large amounts of white on the face and legs and some medium-sized belly spots, while another was nearly all-white. [...] It is a <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutation</b> on Exon7. The founder of this line was GQ Santana, foaled in 2000.|$|E
40|$|Homonucleotide runs in coding {{sequences}} are {{hot spots}} for <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> and {{potential sources of}} genetic changes leading to cancer in humans having a mismatch repair defect. We examined <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> in homonucleotide runs of deoxyadenosines ranging from 4 to 14 bases at the same position in the LYS 2 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the msh 2 mismatch repair mutant, runs of 9 to 14 deoxyadenosines are 1, 700 -fold to 51, 000 -fold, respectively, more mutable for single-nucleotide deletions than are runs of 4 deoxyadenosines. These <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> can account for up to 99 % of all forward mutations inactivating the 4 -kb LYS 2 gene. Based on results with single and double mutations of the POL 2 and MSH 2 genes, both DNA polymerase epsilon proofreading and mismatch repair are efficient for short runs while only the mismatch repair system prevents <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> in runs of > or = 8 nucleotides. Therefore, coding sequences containing long homonucleotide runs {{are likely to be}} at risk for mutational inactivation in cells lacking mismatch repair capability...|$|R

40|$|A {{portion of}} the avian sarcoma virus (ASV) primary RNA {{transcripts}} is alternatively spliced in chicken embryo fibroblast cells to two different messages, the src and env mRNAs. <b>Frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> of the viral genome causing premature translation termination within the src gene result in a decreased steady-state level of the src mRNA. In marked contrast, <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> at various positions of the env gene do not decrease {{the level of the}} env mRNA. We show that the src gene product is not required in trans for splicing and accumulation of src mRNA. Conversely, the truncated Src proteins do not act negatively in trans to decrease specifically the levels of src mRNA. Taken together, these results indicate that the <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> act in cis to reduce src mRNA levels. A double mutant with a lesion in the src initiator AUG and a frameshift within the src gene demonstrated wild-type RNA levels, indicating that the src mRNA must be recognized as a translatable mRNA for the effect on src mRNA levels to occur. Our results indicate that the reduced levels do not result from decreased cytoplasmic stability of the mature src mRNA. We also show that the src gene <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> affect src mRNA levels when expressed from intronless src cDNA clones. We conclude that the reduction of src mRNA levels triggered by the presence of <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> within the src gene occurs while it is associated with the nucleus. Our data also strongly suggest that this occurs at a step of RNA processing or transport independent of RNA splicing...|$|R
2500|$|A <b>frameshift</b> <b>{{mutation}}</b> (also {{called a}} framing error or a reading frame shift) is a genetic mutation caused by indels (insertions or deletions) {{of a number}} of nucleotides in a DNA sequence that is not divisible by three.

The genetic control of the mutational processes has been analyzed using different Escherichia coli mutants, affected either in the control or in the mutagenesis pathway of the SOS system. We have shown that IQ adducts induce very efficiently both - 1 and - 2 <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> in E. coli. Both types of deletion mutations are induced in bacteria without the need of SOS induction, indicating that no LexA-controlled functions, in particular the UmuDC proteins, are required for mutation fixation. We have also shown that the frequency of IQ-induced - 2 <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> in alternating GC sequences increases with {{the length of the}} repetition. The efficiency of IQ adducts to induce - 1 and - 2 <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> {{is similar to that of}} N- 2 -acetylaminofluorene (AAF) adducts. Both chemicals are potent carcinogens which form covalent adducts at the C 8 position of guanines.

40|$|Abstract Background Microsatellite {{instability}} (MSI) {{occurs in}} 15 % of colorectal cancers (CRC). The genetic targets for mutation in the MSI phenotype include somatic mutations in the transforming growth factor beta receptor typeII (TGFbetaRII), BAX, hMSH 3 and hMSH 6. It {{is not clear}} how mutations of these genes mediate tumor progression in the MSI pathway, and the temporal sequence of these mutations remains uncertain. In this study, early stage CRCs were examined for <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> in these target genes, and compared with late stage tumors and CRC cell lines. Methods We investigated 6 CRC cell lines and 71 sporadic CRCs, including 61 early stage cancers and 10 late stage cancers. Mutations of repetitive mononucleotide tracts in the coding regions of TGFbetaRII, BAX, hMSH 3, hMSH 6, IGFIIR and Fas antigen were identified by direct sequencing. Results Thirteen (18. 3 %) of 71 CRC, including 9 / 61 (14. 7 %) early stage cancers and 4 / 10 (40 %) late stage cancers, were identified as MSI and analyzed for <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations.</b> No mutation in the target genes was observed in any of the 9 early stage MSI CRCs. In contrast, <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> of TGFbetaRII, BAX, hMSH 3 and hMSH 6 were present in 3 / 4 late stage MSI tumors. There is a statistical association (p = 0. 014) between mutation in any one gene and tumor stage. Conclusions TGFbetaRII, BAX, hMSH 3 and hMSH 6 mutations are relatively late events in the genesis of MSI CRCs. The <b>frameshift</b> <b>mutations</b> in these target genes might mediate progression from early to late stage cancer, rather than mediating the adenoma to carcinoma transition. </p...|$|R
