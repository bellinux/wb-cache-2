5|$|The {{continuing}} {{search for}} Burgess Shale fossils {{since the mid-1970s}} <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> description in the 1980s of an arthropod Sanctacaris and in 2007 of Orthrozanclus, which looked like a slug with a small shell at the front, chain mail over the back and long, curved spines round the edges. Recent digs have discovered species yet to be formally described and named. They have also unearthed more and sometimes better fossils of animals that were discovered earlier, for example Odontogriphus was for many years known from just one poorly preserved specimen, but {{the discovery of a}} further 189 formed the basis for a detailed description and analysis in 2006. Re-examination of Walcott's collection also continues, and <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reconstruction of the large marine animal Hurdia in 2009.|$|E

5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 {{has the potential to}} be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has proven to be 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E

5|$|An {{increase}} in intermarriage in the United States <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> blurring of ethnic lines. Anti-miscegenation laws (laws banning interracial marriages) were abolished in the United States in 1967 {{and now it}} is estimated that one-fifth of the population in the United States by 2050 {{will be part of the}} polyethnic population. In 2000, self-identified Multiracial Americans numbered 6.8 million or 2.4% of the population.|$|E
5|$|At the time, no type {{specimen}} was specified, as the practice only arose later, in the 19th century. When a lectotype (type selected amongst original material) was designated, it {{was assigned to}} specimen 242.1 of Linnaeus' herbarium, the only V.thapsus specimen. The species had previously been designated as type species for Verbascum. European plants exhibit considerable phenotypical variation, which <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plant acquiring many synonyms over the years. Introduced American populations show much less variation.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated by humans both as pets and for {{practical}} purposes. Colourful birds, such as parrots and mynas, are bred in captivity or kept as pets, {{a practice that}} <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> illegal trafficking of some endangered species. Falcons and cormorants have long been used for hunting and fishing, respectively. Messenger pigeons, used since at least 1 AD, remained important as recently as World War II. Today, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism, or for sports such as pigeon racing.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{may also}} be planted {{outdoors}} in regions with suitable climates. Concern for water conservation in arid regions <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> promotion of gardens requiring less watering (xeriscaping).

Cacti are one group of drought-resistant plants recommended for dry landscape gardening.|$|E
5|$|DKA most {{frequently}} occurs {{in those who}} already have diabetes, {{but it may also}} be the first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic. There is often a particular underlying problem that <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, a urinary tract infection), pregnancy, inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke or the use of cocaine. Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying eating disorder, or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{uses the}} unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus {{used as a}} structural material {{rather than as a}} carrier of biological information. This <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> creation of two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the DNA origami method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins.|$|E
5|$|Home to Aboriginal {{groups for}} over 40,000 years, the Riverina was {{originally}} settled by Europeans in {{the mid-19th century}} as a pastoral region providing beef and wool to markets in Australia and beyond. In the 20th century, the development of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> introduction of crops such as rice and wine grapes. The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria, and the region {{was the source of}} much of the impetus behind the federation of Australian colonies.|$|E
5|$|In comparison, the South Island has {{experienced}} fewer large earthquakes. The magnitude 7.1 Mw event of 4 September 2010 produced {{by far the}} strongest ground motions ever recorded in the Canterbury region, triggering {{a large number of}} aftershocks. Although similar aftershock sequences have historically occurred around the world, such occurrences were extremely unusual in the region, which had shown low levels of seismic activity for thousands of years. The event <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discovery of previously dormant geological faults across central-eastern South Island, in particular beneath regional plains and the adjacent seabed.|$|E
