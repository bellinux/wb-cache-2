5|$|Other {{blood tests}} are often taken to help {{understand}} a person's general health and risk <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> contribute to heart disease. These often include a {{full blood count}} investigating for anaemia, and basic metabolic panel that may reveal any disturbances in electrolytes. A coagulation screen is often required {{to ensure that the}} right level of anticoagulation is given. Fasting lipids and fasting blood glucose (or an HbA1c level) are often ordered to evaluate a person's cholesterol and diabetes status, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the positions of the}} thrust levers, the report points to several <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have contributed to the accident, such as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles on the runway, as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length of the runway for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect thrust lever positions which TAM had rejected.|$|E
5|$|Manta {{rays are}} subject to other {{anthropogenic}} threats. Because mantas must swim constantly to flush oxygen-rich water over their gills, they are vulnerable to entanglement and subsequent suffocation. Mantas cannot swim backwards and, because of their protruding cephalic fins, are prone to entanglement in fishing lines, nets, and even loose mooring lines. When snared, mantas often attempt to free themselves by somersaulting, tangling themselves further. Loose, trailing line can wrap around and cut its way into its flesh, resulting in irreversible injury. Similarly, mantas become entangled in gill nets designed for smaller fish. Some mantas are injured by collision with boats, especially in areas where they congregate and are easily observed. Other threats or <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> affect manta numbers are climate change, tourism, pollution from oil spills, and the ingestion of microplastics.|$|E

5|$|The edmontosaurs {{also showed}} enriched carbon isotope values, which for modern mammals would be {{interpreted}} as a mixed diet of C3 plants (most plants) and C4 plants (grasses); however, C4 plants were extremely rare in the Late Cretaceous if present at all. Thomas and Carlson put forward several <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have been operating, and found the most likely to include a diet heavy in gymnosperms, consuming salt-stressed plants from coastal areas adjacent to the Western Interior Seaway, and a physiological difference between dinosaurs and mammals that caused dinosaurs to form tissue with different carbon ratios than would be expected for mammals. A combination of factors is also possible.|$|E
5|$|The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on {{a monthly}} basis back to 1854; {{according}} to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe. <b>Factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the establishment of deposit insurance {{in the form of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933, increased regulation of the banking sector, the adoption of interventionist Keynesian economics, and the increase in automatic stabilizers in the form of government programs (unemployment insurance, social security, and later Medicare and Medicaid). See Post-World War II economic expansion for further discussion.|$|E
25|$|Understanding how {{a corpse}} {{decomposes}} and the <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> alter {{the rate of}} decay is extremely important for evidence in death investigations. Campobasso, Vella, and Introna consider the <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> inhibit or favor the colonization of insects to be vitally important when determining the time of insect colonization.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> {{have contributed}} to Cochems' story fading from the public's memory was the {{decision}} of St. Louis University to discontinue intercollegiate football in 1949.|$|R
2500|$|One risk <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> lead to genericization {{is the use}} of a {{trademark}} as a verb, plural or possessive, unless the mark itself is possessive or plural (e.g., [...] "Friendly's" [...] restaurants).|$|R
50|$|Another {{transcription}} <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be a downstream {{target of}} Ngn3 is Nkx2.2 because it’s often coexpressed with it. Studies {{have shown that}} disrupting Nkx2.2 expression results in problems with α and β cell differentiation.|$|R

40|$|Adaptive {{tensor product}} wavelet methods are applied for solving Poisson’s equation, {{as well as}} {{anisotropic}} generalizations, in high space dimensions. It will be demonstrated that the resulting approximations converge in energy norm with {{the same rate as}} the best approximations from the span of the best N tensor product wavelets, where moreover the constant <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> we <b>may</b> lose is independent of the space dimension n. The cost of producing these approximations will be proportional to their length with a constant <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> grow with n, but only linearly...|$|R
50|$|Other {{members of}} the family are {{alpha-tocopherol}} transfer protein and phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein (Sec14). They transport their substrates (alpha-tocopherol and phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylcholine, respectively) between different intracellular membranes.

25|$|<b>Factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> {{affect the}} {{accuracy}} of bite mark identification include time-dependent changes of the bite mark on living bodies, effects of where the bite mark was found, damage on soft tissue, and similarities in dentition among individuals. Other factors include poor photography, impressions, or measurement of dentition characteristics.|$|E
50|$|One <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> {{indicate}} increased severity {{this season}} is that the predominant circulating type of influenza virus is Influenza A (H3N2) viruses, which account for about 76 percent of the viruses reported. Typically, H3N2 seasons have been more severe, with higher numbers of hospitalizations and deaths.|$|R
50|$|Another <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> {{have contributed}} to the trend was The Equal Pay Act of 1963, which aimed at abolishing wage {{disparity}} based on sex. Such legislation diminished sexual discrimination and encouraged more women to enter the labor market by receiving fair remuneration to help raising families and children.|$|R

25|$|Nutritional <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> {{increase}} risk of gallstones include constipation; eating fewer meals per day; low {{intake of}} the nutrients folate, magnesium, calcium, and vitamin C; low fluid consumption; and, {{at least for}} men, a high intake of carbohydrate, a high glycemic load, and high glycemic index diet. Wine and whole-grained bread may decrease the risk of gallstones.|$|E
25|$|Additional <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> {{have contributed}} to the onset of the Neoproterozoic snowball include the {{introduction}} of atmospheric free oxygen, which may have reached sufficient quantities to react with methane in the atmosphere, oxidizing it to carbon dioxide, a much weaker greenhouse gas, and a younger — thus fainter — Sun, which would have emitted 6 percent less radiation in the Neoproterozoic.|$|E
40|$|Background Comorbidity between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and {{depression}} is high, also in older adults.

50|$|This event {{sufficiently}} {{impressed the}} Sardar (Governor) of Gujarat, who reported {{it to the}} Emperor. Thereafter the Emperor was more favourable towards the English than the Portuguese. Another <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have influenced him was that the Portuguese were very anti-Islam, and often harassed Mecca-bound pilgrim ships along the West coast of India.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to pressure, friction, and shear, {{there are more}} risk factors of pressure ulcers. Physiological (intrinsic) and non physiological (extrinsic)) <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> place a patient at risk include diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, cerebral vascular accident and hypotension. Other factors are age of 70 years and older, current smoking history, dry skin, low body mass index, impaired mobility, altered mental status, urinary and fecal incontinence, malnutrition, physical restraints, malignancy, history of pressure ulcers.|$|E
25|$|ATSDR is {{starting}} a new registry for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's Disease). President George W. Bush signed the ALS Registry Act, which provided for establishment of the registry, on October 8, 2008. It is hoped that the registry will provide information on the prevalence of ALS and lead {{to a better understanding}} of <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be associated with the disease.

25|$|The {{significant}} intrafamilial variability {{observed in}} the severity of renal and extrarenal manifestations points to genetic and environmental modifying <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> influence the outcome of ADPKD, and results of {{an analysis of the}} variability in renal function between monozygotic twins and siblings support the role of genetic modifiers in this disease. It is estimated that 43–78% of the variance in age to ESRD could be due to heritable modifying factors, with parents as likely as children to show more severe disease in studies of parent-child pairs.|$|E
30|$|An extra <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> can {{contribute}} to the morning increasing trend of PG is thunderstorm activity in Asia, which was at its maximum at that time (Harrison 2013; Blakeslee et al. 2014). The contribution of that parameter is considered rather low compared with the aforementioned factors, yet it is mentioned here as the only global <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> act on the local primary PG maximum.|$|R
30|$|Yet another <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> {{influence}} reliability are {{the researchers}} themselves, by misinterpretation and errors in transcriptions. We {{tried to avoid}} the “halo effect” (Porta et al. 2014), which would influence {{the interpretation of the}} findings by the previously gained knowledge. The fact that two researchers were conducting the survey leads to reciprocal control.|$|R
50|$|A <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> {{aid in the}} {{differentiation}} of costochondritis from Tietze syndrome is {{the location of the}} pain on the sternum. Costochondritis typically affects the third, fourth, and fifth costosternal joints in contrast to Tietze's syndrome, which usually affects the second or third costosternal joint. Pain from costochondritis typically resolves within one year.|$|R
