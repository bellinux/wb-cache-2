40|$|In many landscapes, an {{important}} <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> <b>objective</b> {{is to reduce}} the negative impacts from unplanned fires on people, property and ecological values. In Australia, there exists an inherent assumption that high spatial variability in fire ages and hence fuel loads will have negative effects on both the incidence and spread of subsequent fires, and will enhance ecological values. A recent study using the process-based computer simulation model FIRESCAPE-SWTAS predicted several relationships between prescribed burn treatment levels and spatial patterning and management objectives in south-west Tasmania, Australia. The present study extended this investigation to additionally explore the effects of prescribed burning treatment unit size on unplanned fire incidence and area burned both in the general landscape and specifically in fire-intolerant vegetation. Simulation results suggest that treatment level had the greatest influence on modifying fire effects, whereas treatment unit size had the least effect. The model predicted that all three parameters interacted to determine the mean annual area burnt by unplanned fires. In fire-intolerant vegetation, treatment unit size did not influence the incidence of unplanned fires and the area burnt by unplanned fires in these communities. Where significant differences were evident, fire risk was reduced by higher treatment levels, deterministic spatial patterns of burning units, and smaller burning unit sizes...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{northern}} temperate regions, sedge meadows {{dominated by}} the tussocksedge Curex strictu Lam. (Cyperaceae) were historically a fire-maintained community type. In two Wisconsin natural areas (Lulu Lake and Summerton), we assessed the effects of time since prescribed spring burning on plant composition and aboveground biomass in eight sedge meadows representing a partial chronosequence of zero to seven years since burning, plus no burning. We recorded plant species cover in line-intercept transects and measured live biomass and litter in sample plots along transects. Responses were prominent {{during the first two}} years after burning. In the Lulu Lake meadows, live biomass and annual forb cover reached their highest values during the first growing season after burning, whereas cover and frequency of perennial forbs were elevated for two seasons. Plant litter was removed by burning but returned to prebum levels in one to two years. In the Summerton meadows, where seven years had elapsed since the last fire, burned and unburned meadows did not differ in live biomass, litter, or relative cover of plant life-forms. It appears that periodic bums do not cause major shifts in the relative dominance of sedges and grasses, which are long-lived clonal perennials. However, because litter removal promotes recruitment of shorter-lived forbs, prescribed fire can enhance sedge meadow diversity by allowing plant species with different life histories to temporarily share dominance with the more abundant graminoids. Periodic seed inputs by forbs to the wetland seed bank may be a desirable <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> <b>objective</b> for maintaining sedge meadow diversity.

40|$|Abstract: Wildfires do {{not respect}} {{property}} boundaries. Whole geographic regions are typically impacted by major wildfire outbreaks. Various fire related resources {{can be shared}} to solve such crises; whether they are shared, {{and how they are}} shared depends to a great extent upon the rapport among the agencies involved. Major progress has been achieved over the past decade largely through the adoption of some formalized processes, such as the National Wildfire Coordinating Group. More progress can be made on into the 21 st century at the local, state, and national levels if managers will support the cost effective use of shared resources in the attainment of wildland <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> <b>objectives.</b> The topic "Shared Resources " at first struck me as being somewhat out of place in the setting of the 21 st century. The more I explored it however, the more it appeared to be the epoxy that will bond us together and enable us to move efficiently into the future. Before launching into this discussion of shared resources, it is important to define the term "share. " According to Webster, a share is "one's full or fair portion, " (Webster 1985).

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{research}} has proven that remote sensing can provide very useful support to fire managers. This chapter {{provides an overview}} of the types of information remote sensing can provide to the fire community. First, it considers <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> information needs {{in the context of a}} <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> information system. An introduction to remote sensing then precedes a description of fire information obtainable from remote sensing data (such as vegetation status, active fire detection and burned areas assessment). Finally, operational examples in five African countries illustrate the practical use of remotely sensed fire information. As indicated in previous chapters, <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> usually comprises activities designed to control the frequency, area, intensity or impact of fire. These activities are undertaken in different institutional, economic, social, environmental and geographical contexts, as well as at different scales, from local to national. The range of <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> activities also varies considerably according to the management issues at stake, as well as the available means and capacity to act. Whatever the level, effective <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> requires reliable information upon which to base appropriate decisions and actions. Information will be required at many different stages of this <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> system. To illustrate this, we consider a typical and generic description of a fire 2 ̆ 2 management loop 2 ̆ 2, as provided in Figure 8. 1. <b>Fire</b> <b>management</b> <b>objectives</b> result from <b>fire</b> related 2 ̆ 2 knowledge 2 ̆ 2. For example, they may relate to sound ecological reasons for prescribed burning in a particular land management context, or to frequent, uncontrolled fires threatening valuable natural or human resources. Whatever the issues, appropriate objectives require scientific knowledge (such as fire impact on ecosystems components, such as soil and vegetation), as well as up-to date monitoring information (such as vegetation status, fire locations, land use, socioeconomic context, etc.). Policies, generally at a national and governmental level, provide the official or legal long term framework (e. g. five to ten years) to undertake actions. A proper documentation of different fire issues, and their evolution, will allow their integration into appropriate policies, whether specific to <b>fire</b> <b>management,</b> or complementary to other policies in areas such as forestry, rangeland, biodiversity, land tenure, etc. Strategies are found at all levels of <b>fire</b> <b>management.</b> They provide a shorter-term framework (e. g. one to five years) to prioritise <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> activities. They involve the development of a clear set of objectives and a clear set of activities to achieve these objectives. They may also include research and training inputs required, in order to build capacity and to answer specific questions needed to improve <b>fire</b> <b>management.</b> The chosen strategy will result from a trade-off between priority <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> <b>objectives</b> and the available capacity to act (e. g. institutional framework, budget, staff, etc.), and will lead towards a better allocation of resources for <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> operations to achieve specific objectives. One example in achieving an objective of conserving biotic diversity may be the implementation of a patch-mosaic burning system (Brockett et al., 200 1) instead of a prescribed block burning system, based on an assumption that the former should better promote biodiversity in the long-term than the latter (Parr 2 ̆ 6 Brockett, 1999). This strategy requires the implementation of early season fires to reduce the size of later season fires. The knowledge of population movements, new settlements or a coming El Nino season, should help focus the resources usage, as these factors might influence the proportion as well as the locations of area burned. Another strategy may be to prioritise the grading of fire lines earlier than usual based on information on high biomass accumulation. However, whatever the strategies, they need to be based on reliable information...|$|R
40|$|Fire {{is used as}} a {{management}} tool for biodiversity conservation worldwide. A common objective is to avoid population extinctions due to inappropriate fire regimes. However, in many ecosystems, it is unclear what mix of fire histories will achieve this goal. We determined the optimal fire history of a given area for biological conservation with a method that links tools from 3 fields of research: species distribution modeling, composite indices of biodiversity, and decision science. We based our case study on extensive field surveys of birds, reptiles, and mammals in fire-prone semi-arid Australia. First, we developed statistical models of species 2 ̆ 7 responses to fire history. Second, we determined the optimal allocation of successional states in a given area, based on the geometric mean of species relative abundance. Finally, we showed how conservation targets based on this index can be incorporated into a decision-making framework for <b>fire</b> <b>management.</b> Pyrodiversity per se did not necessarily promote vertebrate biodiversity. Maximizing pyrodiversity by having an even allocation of successional states did not maximize the geometric mean abundance of bird species. Older vegetation was disproportionately important for the conservation of birds, reptiles, and small mammals. Because our method defines <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> <b>objectives</b> based on the habitat requirements of multiple species in the community, it could be used widely to maximize biodiversity in fire-prone ecosystems. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the turn}} of the 20th century, various federal and state {{agencies}} have been involved in wildland <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> in one form or another. In the early 20th century, for example, the federal government, through the U.S. Army and the U.S. Forest Service, solicited fire suppression as a primary goal of managing the nation's forests. At this time in history fire was viewed as a threat to timber, an economically important natural resource. As such, {{the decision was made to}} devote public funds to fire suppression and fire prevention efforts. For example, the Forest Fire Emergency Fund Act of 1908 permitted deficit spending in the case of emergency fire situations. [...] As a result, the U.S. Forest Service was able to acquire a deficit of over $1 million in 1910 due to emergency fire suppression efforts. [...] Following the same tone of timber resource protection, the U.S. Forest Service adopted the [...] "10 AM Policy" [...] in 1935. [...] Through this policy, the agency advocated the control of all fires by 10 o'clock of the morning following the discovery of a wildfire. Fire prevention was also heavily advocated through public education campaigns such as Smokey Bear. Through these and similar public education campaigns the general public was, in a sense, trained to perceive all wildfire as a threat to civilized society and natural resources. The negative sentiment towards wildland fire prevailed and helped to shape wildland <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> <b>objectives</b> throughout most of the 20th century.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Two {{meanings}} of human community compete for public attention: (1) {{community as a}} sense of belonging to a particular social group within a society, and (2) community as a global ideal consisting of political expression. religious fulfillment, and/or harmony with the world at large. The latter meaning has become increasingly prevalent as we approach the year 2000. This idealistic sense of community is represented in the Clementian theory of ecological succession that formed traditional fire suppression practices. Modern <b>fire</b> <b>management,</b> as practiced by the Forest Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture, is a very recent attempt to substitute rational <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> and particularistic thought for fire suppression practices motivated by such unrealistic ideals. There are signs that rational <b>fire</b> <b>management,</b> as legitimated by responsiveness to particular social groups, is competing with the pursuit of an ideal of a self-regulating natural world-where a "natural harmony " is produced by cycles of disturbance uninfluenced by human volition. Such "millennial fire management" substitutes idealism and aristocratic suffrage of fire scientists for particularistic social and political processes used to identify <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> <b>objectives.</b> Will the year 2000 bring the return of fire to the "Act of God" [...] even though it is a god whose design for natural ecosystems is revealed by scientists?

While a high population persists on Rottnest Island, {{there is evidence}} that the mainland population has declined since European settlement. The species is declared threatened under the WA Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. The conservation status of the quokka requires that particular attention be paid to protecting extant meta-populations and managing habitat. Controlling introduced predators, especially the fox and feral pigs and the wise use of fire, are fundamental to quokka conservation. Fire {{plays an important role in}} protecting and maintaining quokka habitat, but inappropriate fire regimes, including intense wildfires, can threaten quokka populations and other values. The quokka is recognized as one of a small group of forest dwelling organisms that are known to be fire regime specific (or fire sensitive) and it often shares its habitat with other organisms (plants and animals) that have similar fire regime requirements. Current knowledge suggests that a managed fire regime based on the requirements of fire regime specific taxa such as the quokka, is likely to benefit other organisms (focal species approach).

Wildfire simulation and network analysis were used to quantify the exchange of fire among land tenures and communities and analyze the relative contributions of human versus natural ignitions to wildfire exposure. Among the land tenures examined, the area burned by incoming fires averaged 57 % of the total burned area. Community exposure from incoming fires ignited on surrounding land tenures accounted for 67 % of the total area burned. The number of land tenures contributing wildfire to individual communities and surrounding wildland urban interface (WUI) varied from 3 to 20. Community firesheds, i. e. the area where ignitions can spawn fires that can burn into the WUI, covered 40 % of the landscape, and were 5. 5 {{times larger than the}} combined area of the community core and WUI.

Examples include the invasion of cheat grass (Bromus tectorum) in the Great Basin, melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia) in the Everglades, spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) in the Rocky Mountains, and yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis) in California. On the other hand, fire can also be an important tool for managing plant invasions. Managers of wildland fire use programs should consider the potential interactions of invasive plants with fuels, fire behavior, and fire regimes to ensure that their <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> goals and <b>objectives</b> can be met in the presence of these non-native plants. At the very least, land managers should monitor for invasive plants following fires and take mitigating measures as appropriate.|$|R
40|$|The {{restoration}} of historical fuel conditions and fire regimes {{is one of}} the primary land management goals in the Shivwits Plateau region of northwestern Arizona. Fire is the primary tool used in this region to reduce fuel loads and shift landscapes back to historical conditions of a low intensity, 8 - 15 year return interval, surface fire regime. However, the invasive plant cheatgrass has become the dominant understory vegetation and fuel type following initial fire treatments in many areas. There is significant concern that repeated burning at historically appropriate fire return intervals for ponderosa pine forest will benefit this invasive plant to the detriment of native species. There is additional concern that the high flammability of cheatgrass fuelbeds will lead to fire return intervals that are more frequent than occurred historically and that are prescribed in the agency <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> plans, potentially preventing recruitment of pine seedlings and leading to type conversion of native forests to alien grasslands. Federal land managers and research scientists have noted that cheatgrass does not typically cooccur with two of the dominant perennial grasses in the Shivwits plateau region, bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis). This suggests that these natives may be competing with and excluding the establishment of cheatgrass. If these species can be established in postfire landscapes, {{they may be able to}} pre-empt the establishment of cheatgrass and promote the {{restoration of}} native plant communities and natural fuel characteristics. This report provides results of an experimental seedings of these two perennial grasses. Seeding with or without raking had no detectable effects on any of the species or groups of species in this study as measured by: 1) the density, cover, and species diversity of standing vegetation during the first 5 post-treatment years; or 2) the density and species diversity of the soil seedbank during the first 3 post-treatment years. Blue grama had an overall low standing density and cover, and seedbank density, at the study site, whereas bottlebrush squirreltail had relatively high standing density and cover, and seedbank density, at least during some of the sampling years. Cheatgrass did not differ among treatments, including raked and unraked plots, and only increased from 1. 1 seeds per 18 cubic cm of soil immediately following the fire in fall 2003 to 1. 5 seeds by the fall of the third postfire year. These results suggest that blue grama may be an inappropriate species for seeding at this study site, whereas bottlebrush squirreltail may be an appropriate species. Although the natural recovery of the latter species within a few years following fire suggest that seeding may not be necessary. In addition, cheatgrass may not be a significant postfire management concern at this study site. Additional research is needed to more definitively evaluate the effects of seeding treatments, document the postfire recovery rates of cheatgrass and other species under a wider range of environmental conditions, and determine if there is a specific fire prescription that can both control cheatgrass and accomplish other <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> <b>objectives...</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{recognize}} that land managers face many constraints (legal and social) and often competing regulatory and <b>management</b> <b>objectives</b> that limit wildfire management options. However, the Planning Rule and the National Cohesive Wildland <b>Fire</b> <b>Management</b> Strategy (USDI and USDA 2014) offer opportunities {{to put more}} fire back on the landscape whether through prescribed burning or managed wildfires. We provide some general concepts that managers might apply with pyrodiversity outcomes realized through mixed-severity fires that meet ecosystem integrity objectives.|$|R
40|$|Char as a carbon-rich material, can be {{produced}} under pyrolytic conditions, wildfires or prescribed burn offs for <b>fire</b> <b>management.</b> The <b>objective</b> {{of this study was}} to elucidate mechanistic interactions of copper (Cu 2 +) and nickel (Ni 2 +) with different chars produced by pyrolysis (green waste, GW; blue-Mallee, BM) and forest fires (fresh-burnt by prescribed fire, FC; aged char produced by wild fire, AC). The pyrolytic chars were more effective sorbents of Cu 2 + (∼ 11 times) and Ni 2 + (∼ 5 times) compared with the forest fire chars. Both cross-polarization (CPMAS-NMR) and Bloch decay (BDMAS-NMR) 13 C NMR spectroscopies showed that forest fire chars have higher woody components (aromatic functional groups) and lower polar groups (e. g. O-alkyl C) compared with the pyrolytic chars. The polarity index was greater in the pyrolytic chars (0. 99 – 1. 34) than in the fire-generated chars (0. 98 – 1. 15), while aromaticity was lower in the former than in the latter. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies indicated the binding of carbonate and phosphate with both Cu 2 + and Ni 2 + in all chars, but with a greater extent in pyrolytic than forest fire-generated chars. These findings have demonstrated the key role of char's oxygen-containing functional groups in determining their sorption capacity for the Cu 2 + and Ni 2 + in contaminated lands.

30|$|Under certain {{conditions}} wildland fire can promote significant ecological benefits {{and reduce the}} risk that high intensity fires will spread to areas of high value into the future (Noss et al. 2006). Although there is broad scientific consensus regarding {{the need for more}} fire on the landscape, almost all <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> entities within western states require and promote aggressive suppression of all wildfires. Within federal land management agencies knowledge and experience allowing wildfires to burn for beneficial effects has been growing over time and is established within the land <b>management</b> <b>objectives</b> of the different federal agencies. The published 2009 interpretation of US Federal Wildfire Policy (Fire Executive Council 2009) expanded the opportunity of managers to better consider beneficial aspects of wildfire when determining <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> strategies. However, achieving increased beneficial wildfire opportunities in practice has been far more challenging. Existing land and <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> plans have not sufficiently considered the role of existing beneficial use on future <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> opportunities (Doan et al. 2006; Calkin et al. 2011) and managers are subject to a status quo bias that makes them reluctant to select beneficial use strategies when full suppression has been previously established (Wilson et al. 2011). Despite increased scientific recognition of the need to allow wildfire in fire adapted ecosystems to burn for resource benefit and examples of successful wildland fire use programs suppression persists as the dominant <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> strategy.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this policy}} is to outline {{scientific}} issues of interest to BirdLife Australia {{in relation to the}} <b>management</b> of <b>fire</b> in Australia. Position Statement 1. In dealing with unplanned fires and in implementing planned fires, human life and property is of primary concern. Nevertheless, priority should be given to <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> strategies that, while managing threat to human life and property, are designed to minimise any detrimental impacts on biodiversity. 2. When fire is planned for the purpose of achieving ecological <b>management</b> <b>objectives,</b> it should be carried out in accordance with an area-specific, integrated management plan that has clearly enunciated objectives. These plans should specify the role and purpose of using fire for the persistence of particular species and ecological communities, and describe procedures for evaluating the success of management actions in relation to the specified objectives 3. BirdLife Australia supports the development of four key areas of scientifically based <b>fire</b> <b>management.</b> a. The preparation of <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> guidelines for managing the habitats of birds and other faunal species of conservation significance. b. On-ground implementation of scientific knowledge in fire ecology and conservation biology. This includes the employment of skilled technicians in the field of <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> to ensure that scientific guidelines are appropriately applied. c. Monitoring and evaluation of the impacts of <b>fire</b> and <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> on <b>fire</b> patterns, birds and their habitats, which is ongoing and adequately resourced. Such monitoring is particularly important given the uncertainties about future environmental change due to climate change. d. An adaptive-management approach that ensures that the results of monitoring the effectiveness of <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> in asset protection and achieving ecological objectives are constantly fed into planning of future burns...|$|R
30|$|There {{are three}} general <b>fire</b> and fuels <b>management</b> {{approaches}} for achieving resource objectives {{in the southern}} Sierra Nevada: mechanical treatments, prescribed fire, and wildfires managed to meet resource <b>management</b> <b>objectives.</b> These <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> tools have specific advantages and constraints when applied exclusively or in combination at different spatial scales (Collins et al. 2010, Quinn-Davidson and Varner 2011, Ryan et al. 2013). The extent to which land managers implement each of these approaches varies among the federal agencies in the ecoregion, with relatively greater use of wildland fire by the NPS, and mechanical treatments by the FS and BLM. The BLM currently does not manage wildfires for resource objectives in the ecoregion.|$|R
40|$|Forests in the United States {{generate}} many non-market {{benefits for}} society {{that can be}} enhanced and diminished by wildfire and wildfire management. The Federal Wildland <b>Fire</b> <b>Management</b> Policy (1995, updated 2001), and subsequent Guidance to the Implementation of that policy provided in 2009, require <b>fire</b> <b>management</b> priorities be set {{on the basis of}} values to be protected (including natural and cultural resources), costs of protection, and natural resource <b>management</b> <b>objectives</b> (including beneficial <b>fire</b> effects). Implementation of this policy is challenging because those charged with executing the policy have limited information about the value that society places on non-market goods and services at risk. This paper reviews the challenges of accommodating non-market values affected by wildfire in social costbenefit analysis and proposes an economic research agendum to support more efficient management of wildfire in the United States. © IAWF 2011...|$|R
