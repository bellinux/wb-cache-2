2500|$|Gold was {{identified}} by the geologist Rev. W. B. Clarke at Gundagai in 1842. A gold rush hit the area in 1858 following further discoveries of gold and mining continued initially until 1875 and following a second gold rush in 1894, mines operated again {{until well into the}} 20th Century with some mining activity still occurring in 2007. [...] The best known historical mines were the 'Robinson and Rice's Mine' (Long Tunnel Mine) a few miles to the south west of Gundagai and the 'Prince of Wales Mine' (where Herbert Hoover, the future President of the United States, was the mining engineer in about 1900) a few miles to the immediate west of Gundagai.

50|$|Calaverite, or <b>gold</b> <b>telluride,</b> is an {{uncommon}} telluride of gold, a metallic mineral with the chemical formula AuTe2, with approximately 3% {{of the gold}} replaced by silver.

50|$|Many metal tellurides are known, {{including}} some telluride minerals. These include natural <b>gold</b> <b>tellurides,</b> like calaverite and krennerite (AuTe2), and sylvanite (AgAuTe4). Commercially, the tellurides are minor ores of gold, although they comprise the major naturally occurring compounds of gold. (A few other natural compounds of gold, {{such as the}} bismuthide maldonite (Au2Bi) and antimonide aurostibite (AuSb2), are known).

50|$|Gold is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Au (from aurum) and atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is {{a transition metal}} and a group 11 element. It {{is one of the}} least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (<b>gold</b> <b>tellurides).</b>|$|R
50|$|Krennerite is an {{orthorhombic}} <b>gold</b> <b>telluride</b> mineral {{which can}} contain variable amounts of {{silver in the}} structure. The formula is AuTe2 varying to (Au0.8,Ag0.2)Te2.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{the report on}} the results of work {{undertaken}} to find the methods best adapted to the determination of the distribution of the valuable metals in the minerals of an ore. The carriers of the noble metals, particularly gold, are a problem difficult of solution, but of very great commercial import. The ore from the Noranda Mine was chosen for study. It is a gold bearing ore with an admixture of other minerals. A knowledge of the distribution of the gold between native <b>gold,</b> <b>tellurides,</b> and solid solution or fine distribution through other minerals, would give the limits beyond which further dressing of the ore would be unprofitable, and might give a clue to new provisions that would make for a greater recovery of gold: also a more effective recovery of other minerals.

40|$|The {{mineralogy}} and {{occurrence of}} gold varies {{in a systematic}} manner in volcanic-hosted massive sulfide deposits of eastern Australia. In deposits where it is concentrated with zinc {{at or near the}} top of the massive sulfide deposit, gold occurs in auriferous arsenopyrite and pyrite in the center of the lens, and electrum of variable fineness (300 - 900) in the baritic top of the lens. The former occurrence results from precipitation of the gold into the lattice of arsenopyrite and coprecipitation of submicroscopic gold grains in arsenic-poor pyrite. The latter occurrence results from direct precipitation of electrum from thio complexes owing to the decrease in aH•s caused by dilution and oxidation as hydrothermal fluids mix with seawater. In deposits where gold is concentrated with copper at the base of the sulfide lens and in the stringer zones, the gold occurs as electrum of high fineness (750 - 1, 000) or as <b>gold</b> <b>tellurides</b> that are commonly associated with chalcopyrite and/or pyrite.

40|$|Gold {{mineralization}} at Sukhoi Log {{in eastern}} Siberia is hosted in a deformed Neoproterozoic organic-bearing and pyritic black shale and siltstone sequence that is folded {{into a tight}} overturned anticline. The deposit contains about 30 million ounces of gold at an average grade of 2. 0 g/t Au {{and is one of}} the largest known undeveloped gold resources. The high-grade gold zone forms a gently dipping tabular body in the core of the anticline. The best gold grades occur in narrow, bedding-parallel pyrite-quartz veinlets that have been folded during the main deformation event. Lower grade gold is associated with disseminated pyrite developed in and around the high-grade core of the deposit. Detailed paragenetic studies of the mineralization and host rocks have defined six stages of pyrite development in the carbonaceous sediments. The two earliest forms of pyrite, termed py 1 and py 2, are commonly developed in stratiform layers of micron-sized crystals, framboids and fine euhedra, which are interpreted as synsedimentary to early diagenetic in origin. Coarser grained, bedding-parallel aggregates of inclusion-rich pyrite, termed py 3, contain inclusions of arsenopyrite, native <b>gold</b> and <b>gold</b> <b>tellurides</b> and are interpreted to form during late diagenesis and earliest deformation. Coarse euhedral pyrite, py 4, overgrows the earlier pyrite (py 1, py 2, and py 3), and the slaty cleavage developed in the host rocks, indicating a syndeformation timing. Late- stage, inclusion-free pyrite, py 5, overgrows and replaces earlier sulfides and is considered to be syn- to late deformation. Laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) analyses of the various pyrite types indicate that the synsedimentary py 1 contains the highest levels of invisible gold, varying from 0. 4 to 12. 1 ppm, with a mean of 3. 22 ppm Au, and 1, 900 ppm As. Py 1 is also enriched in a suite of trace elements (Mo, Sb, Ni, Co, Se, Te, Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn, Ba, Cr, U, V), which are similar to those concentrated by organic processes in euxinic sedimentary environments. Later generations of pyrite, from py 2 to py 5, including pyrite in bedding- parallel pyrite-quartz veinlets, contain progressively lower contents of invisible gold and most other trace elements. However, this metamorphic and postmetamorphic pyrite contains microinclusions of free gold, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite. The paragenetic, textural, and chemical relationships at Sukhoi Log suggest that gold was clearly initially introduced prior to cleavage development, accompanying sedimentation of the organic-rich shales and fixed during diagenesis within the structure of diagenetic arsenian pyrite. Subsequently, accompanying deformation, gold was liberated from recrystallized diagenetic pyrite to become concentrated as free <b>gold</b> and <b>gold</b> <b>tellurides</b> within metamorphic pyrite and folded bedding-parallel pyrite-quartz veinlets. Two key processes are considered vital to the formation of the Sukhoi Log deposit: original synsedimentary and early diagenetic concentration of gold, dissolved within arsenian pyrite in organic-rich black shales, and metamorphic processes that liberated gold from the early forms of arsenian pyrite, to be concentrated as free <b>gold,</b> and <b>gold</b> <b>tellurides</b> within late diagenetic and metamorphic pyrite and associated pyrite-quartz veinlets in the core of an overturned anticline. These ore-forming processes are unlikely to be unique to Sukhoi Log; other black-shale and turbidite-hosted deposits that occur in rifted continental margin environments, which have undergone collision and basin inversion, may form by similar processes...|$|R

40|$|During {{the process}} of {{prospecting}} for gold aggregates in the stream sediments that are adjacent to the ore bodies in the Alshar deposit (Carlin Type), it was established that the content of this metal is much lower in the sediment materials compared with its concentration in the ores. This fact, {{as well as the}} high content of Au in the ore bodies and the assumption ofpre~ious researchers for the small size of the gold (about and less than I ILm), enable to conclude that gold aggregates are not concentrated in the stream sediments which are closely located to the ore bodies, but are rather transported along the lower course of the streams. Therefore, the broadly applied methods ofprospecting for gold deposits by analyzing stream sediments should be considered ineffective for the Alshar deposit,· and probably for other deposits of the Carlin Type. The statistic processing (cluster analysis) of the element associations in the stream sediments confinns the presence of a number of typomorphic minerals for the ores, as well as the relation of Au with Sb and Te.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation was}} made of the geology and petrology of Poorman Mine and adjacent area. The region is about five miles west of Boulder, Colorado, along the road to Gold Hill. It is underlain by Boulder Creek granitegneiss cut by two well known 2 ̆ 7 dikes 2 ̆ 7, named Poorman and Maxwell, which intersect at the south-east corner of Poorman Hill. A careful study of the rocks indicates that the pegmatitic and aplitic material of the 2 ̆ 7 dikes 2 ̆ 7 is closely related to Boulder Creek granite-gneiss. The granite-gneiss intruded this area, the upper zone solidified and fractured, but differentiation of the lower portion continued to produce an acidic magma, which was injected into previous fractures to form the 2 ̆ 7 dikes 2 ̆ 7. These 2 ̆ 7 dikes 2 ̆ 7 do not contain ore. They acted as impermeable barriers which controlled the trend and position of the channels penetrated by the ore solutions. The veins in this area are of fissure-filling type, consisting of <b>gold</b> <b>tellurides,</b> silver ore and some common sulphides, within a black dense quartz material.

Genth found that the telluride formula for calaverite generally corresponded with the gold-silver telluride mineral sylvanite, but had a far lower percentage of ionic silver in place of ionic gold (3 to 3.5% in Genth's analysis, vs. 11 to 13% silver typical for sylvanite). Since silver is isomorphous with gold in telluride minerals (i.e. gold atoms replace silver without automatically changing the crystal character), Genth more importantly reported the calaverite differed from sylvanite in having no distinct crystalline cleavage line, whereas sylvanite was known to have a distinct line of cleavage. (As discussed above, both sylvanite and calaverite have since {{been found to be}} basically monoclinic, whereas the third known gold-silver telluride mineral krennerite is orthorhombic, with yet a different characteristic line of cleavage parallel to the crystal base). Genth was later also able to characterize a sample of calaverite from Boulder, Colorado, finding that his two specimens from that location were 2.04 and 3.03% silver.|$|E
