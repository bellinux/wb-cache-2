40|$|The {{stability}} and dynamics of nonlinear Schrodinger superflows past a two-dimensional disk are investigated using a specially adapted pseudo-spectral method based on mapped Chebychev polynomials. This efficient numerical method allows {{the imposition of}} both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions at the <b>disk</b> <b>border.</b> Small coherence length boundary-layer approximations to stationary solutions are obtained analytically. Newton branch-following is used to compute the complete bifurcation diagram of stationary solutions. The dependence of the critical Mach number on the coherence length is characterized. Above the critical Mach number, at coherence length larger than fifteen times {{the diameter of the}} disk, rarefaction pulses are dynamically nucleated, replacing the vortices that are nucleated at small coherence length...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} energy {{balance between the}} input and the output per unit area for garlic in Hamedan {{province}} of Iran. In this study, data were collected by using random sampling method for 136 face to face questioners. Results showed that the highest share of energy consumption belongs to chemical fertilizers (41. 7 %) followed by diesel (13. 94 %). The results indicated that a total energy input of 40307. 89 MJ ha - 1 was consumed for garlic production. The energy productivity and net energy value were estimated as 0. 416 kg MJ - 1 and- 13477. 82 MJ ha - 1, respectively. The ratio of energy outputs to energy inputs was approximately 0. 665. The benefit-cost ratio was estimated as 1. 36. mechanization degree (MD) was calculated for plowing and <b>disk</b> <b>border</b> were 100 % and 20. 65 %, as the highest and lowest, respectively.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{new point}} is that ultra-high spin of the elementary particles makes Einstein's gravity so strong, that its influence to metric is shifted from Planck to the Compton scale! Compatibility of the Kerr-Newman (KN) gravity with quantum theory is achieved by implementation of the supersymmetric Higgs model without modification of the Einstein-Maxwell gravity. We consider the nonperturbative bag-like solution to supersymmetric generalized LG field model, which creates a flat and supersymmetric vacuum state inside the bag, forming the Compton zone for consistent work of quantum theory. The bag is deformable, and its shape is controlled by BPS bound, providing compatibility of the bag boundary with external gravitational and electromagnetic (EM) field. In particular, for the spinning KN gravity the bag {{takes the form of}} oblate disk with a circular string placed on the <b>disk</b> <b>border.</b> Excitations of the KN EM field create circular traveling waves. The super-bag solution is naturally upgraded to the Wess-Zumino supersymmetric QED model, indicating a bridge from the nonperturbative super-bag to perturbative formalism of the conventional QED.

Dubbed the graph multiplihedron, we provide a realization using integer coordinates.

40|$|The Froissart () {{asymptotic}} behavior of high energy cross-sections, if considered in a parton picture, is usually {{represented as a}} kind of behavior that occurs in the process of a collision of two almost black disks, filled with partons, when radiuses of these - disks grow proportional to log's of there energies. In this article we briefly summarize the main asymptotic properties of - disks that one can expect in QCD. Then we consider if it is possible to guarantee the boost-invariance of transparency T(s,b) = 1 - σ_in(s,b), where σ_in(s,b) is the total inelastic cross-section at a definite impact parameter b, in process of collision of two such -disks. Such a question arise because the mean transverse area of the overlapping of colliding - disks, at the same impact parameter b and total energy √(s), is varying with the Lorentz frame. We show that the value of T(s,b) is not boost-invariant at some b close to the - <b>disk</b> <b>border</b> for the - disks usually expected in QCD. As result the type behavior seems contradictory, or the multiparton system in the high energy Fock wave function must be arranged in rather unusual way.

40|$|We {{report the}} first case of nonarteritic {{anterior}} ischemic neuropathy (NAION) associated with double thrombophilia: protein S deficiency and prothrombin G 20210 A mutation. A 58 -year-old man is presented including the clinical and laboratory findings, cardiovascular profile and thrombophilia screening. The patient presented with 3 / 10 vision and an inferior altitudinal defect in the right eye. Funduscopic examination of the right eye revealed a hyperemic optic disk with blurred superior optic <b>disk</b> <b>border</b> and sectoral nerve fiber layer edema. Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were normal, suggesting a NAION. A workup of cardiovascular risk factors revealed hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension and high-risk asymptomatic coronary artery disease. Due to the family history of deep vein thrombosis in the patient’s daughter, a thrombophilia screening was additionally performed. The results revealed a double thrombophilic defect, namely congenital protein S deficiency and heterozygosity for prothrombin G 20210 A mutation, which were also identified in the patient’s daughter. Anticoagulant warfarin therapy was initiated and the patient underwent a triple bypass surgery. At three-month follow-up, the right optic disk edema had resolved, leaving a pale superior optic nerve head. Visual acuity in the right eye had slightly improved to 4 / 10; however, the dense inferior altitudinal field defect had remained unchanged. The patient is currently treated with warfarin, atorvastatin, irbesartan and metoprolol. This case suggests that {{the first line of}} investigation in all patients with NAION involves assessment of cardiovascular risk factors. However, careful history taking will identify NAION patients who are eligible for additional thrombophilia screening: young patients without vasculopathic risk factors, bilateral or recurrent NAION, idiopathic or recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), positive family history of VTE, and VTE in young age or in unusual sites (e. g. cerebral, hepatic, mesenteric, or renal vein) ...|$|E
40|$|AK Sco {{stands out}} among pre-main {{sequence}} binaries {{because of its}} prominent ultraviolet excess, the high eccentricity of its orbit and the strong tides driven by it. AK Sco consists of two F 5 type stars that get as close as 11 R_* at periastron passage. The presence of a dense (n_e ∼ 10 ^ 11 cm^- 3) extended envelope has been unveiled recently. In this article, we report the results from a XMM-Newton based monitoring of the system. We show that at periastron, X-ray and UV fluxes are enhanced {{by a factor of}} ∼ 3 with respect to the apastron values. The X-ray radiation is produced in an optically thin plasma with T∼ 6. 4 × 10 ^ 6 K and it is found that the N_H column density rises from 0. 35 × 10 ^ 21 cm^- 2 at periastron to 1. 11 × 10 ^ 21 cm^- 2 at apastron, in good agreement with previous polarimetric observations. The UV emission detected in the Optical Monitor band seems to be caused by the reprocessing of the high energy magnetospheric radiation on the circumstellar material. Further evidence of the strong magnetospheric disturbances is provided by the detection of line broadening of 278. 7 km s^- 1 in the N V line with HST/STIS. Numerical simulations of the mass flow from the circumbinary disk to the components have been carried out. They provide a consistent scenario with which to interpret AK Sco observations. We show that the eccentric orbit acts like a gravitational piston. At apastron, matter is dragged efficiently from the inner <b>disk</b> <b>border,</b> filling the inner gap and producing accretion streams that end as ring-like structures around each component of the system. At periastron, the ring-like structures come into contact, leading to angular momentum loss, and thus producing an accretion outburst. Comment: Accepted in Ap...|$|E

40|$|Context. Planetesimals {{and planets}} {{embedded}} in a circumstellar disk are dynamically perturbed by the disk gravity. It causes an apsidal line precession {{at a rate that}} depends on the disk density profile and on the distance of the massive body from the star. Aims: Different analytical models are exploited to compute the precession rate of the perihelion ϖ˙. We compare them to verify their equivalence, in particular after analytical manipulations performed to derive handy formulas, and test their predictions against numerical models in some selected cases. Methods: The theoretical precession rates were computed with analytical algorithms found in the literature using the Mathematica symbolic code, while the numerical simulations were performed with the hydrodynamical code FARGO. Results: For low-mass bodies (planetesimals) the analytical approaches described in Binney & Tremaine (2008, Galactic Dynamics, p. 96), Ward (1981, Icarus, 47, 234), and Silsbee & Rafikov (2015 a, ApJ, 798, 71) are equivalent under the same initial conditions for the disk in terms of mass, density profile, and inner and outer borders. They also match the numerical values computed with FARGO away from the outer border of the disk reasonably well. On the other hand, the predictions of the classical Mestel disk (Mestel 1963, MNRAS, 126, 553) for disks with p = 1 significantly depart from the numerical solution for radial distances beyond one-third of the disk extension because of the underlying assumption of the Mestel disk is that the outer <b>disk</b> <b>border</b> is equal to infinity. For massive bodies such as terrestrial and giant planets, the agreement of the analytical approaches is progressively poorer because of the changes in the disk structure that are induced by the planet gravity. For giant planets the precession rate changes sign and is higher than the modulus of the theoretical value by a factor ranging from 1. 5 to 1. 8. In this case, the correction of the formula proposed by Ward (1981) to account for the presence of a gap is a better approximation, at least in predicting a positive precession rate. Conclusions: Analytical modeling of the precession rate of massive bodies {{embedded in a}} circumstellar disk is accurate for planetesimals and terrestrial planets, but it becomes inaccurate when Jupiter-sized planets are considered. The changes they induce in the disk reverse the precession rate and increase it by more than 50...|$|E
