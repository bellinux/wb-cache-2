In a QR code a passenger specific URL is stored, when <b>Hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>Terminal</b> device running on android OS encodes this URL by the Check-in an passenger which is updated in the central database and any passenger who don’t board on the train his QR code check-in procedure is not done and after the specific time interval the ticket for it is automatically made available in the system for booking to other passengers...|$|E
40|$|Present 3 G {{capability}} to cater for subscriber demand for {{high data rate}} and QoS [Quality of Service] is substantially less than 4 G networks. It is expected that 3 G networks {{will not be able}} to meet the needs of services like video-conferencing, full motion video etc in terms of QoS. 4 G networks provide subscriber with a higher bandwidth (5 GHz), and mobile data rate greater than 100 Mbps. However all these could be achieved along with interoperability and seamless mobility with high QoS in a single <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> <b>terminal</b> in 4 G heterogeneous environment by using Cross-Layer Feedback Design. The conventional ISO-OSI Layered architecture is not well suited for mobile multimedia application due to the varying nature of wireless channel. In order to cope up the problems of layered architecture, cross-layer design is used in 4 G architecture to facilitate interaction among layers for better adaptability of resources as per users demand. This paper provides past accomplishment and future avenues related to enhancing QoS in 4 G networks...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increase}} in demand for video streaming services on the <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> mobile <b>terminals</b> with limited battery life, {{it is important to}} maintain the user Quality of Experience (QoE) while taking the resource consumption into consideration. Hence, the goal is to offer as good quality as feasible, avoiding as much user-annoyance as possible. Hence, it is essential to deliver the video, avoiding any uncontrollable quality distortions. This can be possible when an optimal (or desirable) throughput value is chosen such that exceeding the particular threshold results in entering a region of unstable QoE, which is not feasible. Hence, the concept of QoE-aware sustainable throughput is introduced as the maximal value of the desirable throughput that avoids disturbances in the Quality of Experience (QoE) due to delivery issues, or keeps them at an acceptable minimum. The thesis aims at measuring the sustainable throughput values when video streams of different resolutions are streamed from the server to a mobile client over wireless links, in the presence of network disturbances packet loss and delay. The video streams are collected at the client side for quality assessment and the maximal throughput at which the QoE problems can still be kept at a desired level is determined. Scatter plots were generated for the individual opinion scores and their corresponding throughput values for the disturbance case and regression analysis is performed to find the best fit for the observed data. Logarithmic, exponential, linear and power regressions were considered in this thesis. The R-squared values are calculated for each regression model and the model with R-squared value closest to 1 is determined to be the best fit. Power regression model and logarithmic model have the R-squared values closest to 1.  Better quality ratings have been observed for the low resolution videos in the presence of packet loss and delay for the considered test cases. It can be observed that the QoE disturbances can be kept at a desirable level for the low resolution videos and from the test cases considered for the investigation, 360 px video is more resilient in case of high delay and packet loss values and has better opinion score values. Hence, it can be observed that the throughput is sustainable at this threshold...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{handheld}} {{computers in}} medicine {{has increased in}} the last decade, they are now used {{in a variety of}} clinical settings. There is an underlying assumption that electronic data capture is more accurate that paper-based data methods have been rarely tested. This report documents a study to compare the accuracy of <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computer data capture versus more traditional paper-based methods. Methods Clinical nurses involved in a randomised controlled trial collected patient information on a <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computer in parallel with a paper-based data form. Both sets of data were entered into an access database and the <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computer data compared to the paper-based data for discrepancies. Results Error rates from the handheld computers were 67. 5 error per 1000 fields, compared to the accepted error rate of 10 per 10, 000 field for paper-based double data entry. Error rates were highest in field containing a default value. Conclusion While popular with staff, unacceptable high error rates occurred with <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computers. Training and ongoing monitoring are needed if <b>hand</b> <b>held</b> computers are to be used for clinical data collection. </p...|$|R
