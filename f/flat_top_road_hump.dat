50|$|As of 1965, {{the route}} {{was located in}} northwestern Hancock and {{southern}} Pearl River counties. MS 602 started at MS 43, where which {{is now part of}} the Stennis Space Center. The <b>road,</b> known as <b>Flat</b> <b>Top</b> <b>Road,</b> traveled northeast through the dense forest. About 2 mi north of the southern terminus, MS 602 intersected Texas Flat Road. The road then crossed over Dead Tiger Creek, and shifted back slightly to the west. MS 602 crossed Stall and Everett Branches before turning northwest. It intersected Lott McCarty Road before entering Pearl River County. The route turned west shortly inside the county, traveling toward Picayune. A short section of the former route is now part of MS 43. As MS 602 entered Picayune, it became East Canal Street. The route ended at US 11, next to a railroad track. The road continued as West Canal Street. The road was maintained by the Mississippi State Highway Commission and Hancock County, as part of the state highway system.|$|R

40|$|In {{its most}} simple terms, traffic calming is about {{preserving}} {{the functions of}} local streets. As local streets are intended to provide primarily land-access services, hence, when traffic begins to use local streets for through movements, traffic volume and speed levels become incompatible with this primary function. To respond, {{a study on the}} effectiveness of traffic calming measures in reducing vehicles speed at Taman Setapak residential area was undertaken. Field observations and spot speed survey were conducted to collect primary data. The field observation was carried out to collect data on road geometrics and design characteristics of the <b>road</b> <b>humps.</b> The spot speed survey was administered to collect vehicles speed at different points near the <b>road</b> <b>humps.</b> The major findings include first, the <b>road</b> <b>humps</b> proved effective in reducing the speed of the vehicles and second the design characteristics of the <b>road</b> <b>humps</b> {{is an important factor in}} reducing the speed of the vehicles. The average speed of the vehicles before approaching the <b>road</b> <b>humps</b> was about 30 km/hr and at the <b>road</b> <b>humps</b> below 10 km/hr. The findings showed that the design profiles of the <b>road</b> <b>humps</b> have an impact on the speed of the vehicles; the gentle the design profiles of the <b>road</b> <b>humps</b> especially in terms of its height and slope, the higher the speed of the vehicles near and at the <b>road</b> <b>hump.</b> The findings also showed a clear difference in the average speed of the motorcars approaching the <b>road</b> <b>hump</b> and at the <b>road</b> <b>hump...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>humps</b> are {{synonymous with}} traffic calming seeing as {{this type of}} speed control device has the {{distinction}} of being highly effective in reducing speeds. Speed reduction brought about by <b>road</b> <b>humps</b> {{can be attributed to the}} drop in discomfort levels as vehicle speeds are lowered. Factors that influence speed choice across <b>road</b> <b>humps</b> include drivers’ perception of speed that is suitable for safe and comfortable passing, the design of <b>road</b> <b>humps,</b> and the type and condition of the vehicle. This research was aimed at determining the effect of hump width (with respect to road with) on device operating speed of 100 mm Watts profile <b>road</b> <b>humps</b> with fixed length of 3. 7 m. It was found that smaller <b>hump</b> width to <b>road</b> width (WH/WR) ratios produced lower device operating speeds, and that the use of smaller hump widths is more viable for wide roads (10 m or greater in width) ...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{well-documented}} {{relationship between}} motorists speed and the number, respectively severity, of accidents in urban streets. Also, {{studies have shown}} that vehicle emissions can increase on streets where speed reducing measures are installed, if the driving pattern of the motorists becomes more jerky. Hence, to decrease vehicle emissions and improve traffic safety in built up areas, it is important to motivate or even enforce motorists to drive with a low and even speed. Since most motorists do not always follow the speed limits, different kinds of forcing measures, such as <b>road</b> <b>humps,</b> chicanes and chokers, are used to force motorists to drive slower. The most common of these measures is the <b>road</b> <b>hump.</b> To this date, not many studies, concerning how <b>road</b> <b>humps</b> affect the driving pattern of motorists, have been done. To be able to study the driving pattern of motorists, a method to measure speed continuously over segments of streets has been developed. With this method, speed profiles showing how mean and 85 th percentile speed vary along streets, before and after the streets were re-designed, have been produced. The analyses of these speed profiles reveal that previous studies in this area of interest, have underestimated how much motorists increase their speed between <b>road</b> <b>humps.</b> The analyses also show that motorists always increase their speed between <b>road</b> <b>humps,</b> even if the distance between the humps is only 20 metres. This leads to the conclusion that it is impossible, only using <b>road</b> <b>humps,</b> to make motorists drive with both low and even speed...|$|R

Priority T-junction with <b>road</b> <b>hump</b> on one major arm was investigated for kinematic waves. Automatic traffic counters were installed at each lane of the T-junction for six weeks. Traffic volume, headway, vehicle type and travel speed data were collated and analysed. Results show that right turn movement from the minor will trigger positive traffic shockwave of about 20 km/h, whereas the other turning movements are merely subjected to rarefaction waves.
