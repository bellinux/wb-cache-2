Scaling laws always reveal an important property of the analysed system: self-similarity or multifractality. The observed ground-based and satellite ionospheric time series contain a mix of fluctuations of different physical origin (solar, geomagnetic, neutral atmosphere variability etc.). Description based on scaling features can be applied in the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction studies for further comparison of basic characteristics of intermittent fluctuations in solar wind, magnetosphere and ionosphere systems. Finding the similar scaling features of the solar and geomagnetic data in the ionospheric response might be a signature of common nature of the observed fluctuations.

40|$|The earth's {{ionosphere}} is well {{recognized as}} a dynamical system and non-linearly coupled with the magnetosphere above and natural atmosphere below. The shape and time variability of the ionosphere indeed shows chaos, pattern formation, random behavior and self-organization. The present paper studies the propriety of Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) technique for the <b>ionospheric</b> scintillation <b>index</b> time series. MF-DFA is used to identify the scaling behavior of the ionospheric scintillation time-series data of two different nature. The obtained results show the robustness and the relevancy of the MF-DFA technique for the <b>ionospheric</b> scintillation <b>index</b> time series. The comparison of the MF-DFA results of original data to those of shuffled and surrogate series shows that the multifractal nature of considered time series is almost due to long-range correlations. Subsequently, the Hurst exponents derived from two parallel methods namely Re-scaled range analysis (R/S) and Auto Correlation Function (ACF) are also suggesting the presence of long range correlation. The presented results in this work may be of assistance for future modeling and simulation studies.

The choice of the index should be based on other criteria. It is also shown that there is a slight degree of favourability for a quadratic law between f 0 F 2 and each index of solar activity.

Automation of the channel quality measurement process allowed observation of short term behaviour of the link for comparison with predictions.

40|$|The unusually {{deep and}} {{extended}} solar minimum of cycle 2324 {{made it very}} difficult to predict the solar indices 1 or 2 years into the future. Most of the predictions were proven wrong by the actual observed indices. IRI gets its solar, magnetic, and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>indices</b> from an indices file that is updated twice a year. In recent years, due to the unusual solar minimum, predictions had to be corrected downward with every new indices update. In this paper we analyse how much the uncertainties in the predictability of solar activity indices affect the IRI outcome and how the IRI values calculated with predicted and observed indices compared to the actual measurements. Monthly median values of F 2 layer critical frequency (foF 2) derived from the ionosonde measurements at the mid-latitude ionospheric station Juliusruh were compared with the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI- 2007) model predictions. The analysis found that IRIprovides reliable results that compare well with actual measurements, when the definite (observed and adjusted) indices of solar activityare used, while IRI values based on earlier predictions of these indices noticeably overestimated the measurements during the solar minimum. One of the principal objectives {{of this paper is to}} direct attention of IRI users to update their solar activity indices files regularly.

The multiquadric method allows a surface to be drawn strictly over a given set of points unlike many other currently used ionosphere mapping methods. A non-linear dependence of f 0 F 2 and M(3000) F 2 on solar activity level (expressed by MF 2 index) is used to establish local models for each ionosonde station. Observations on 28 ionosondes for f 0 F 2 and 19 for M(3000) F 2 over 10 - 30 years were used for model derivation. The MQMF provides better accuracy than the CCIR model in retrospective mode over Europe.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an hourly local <b>ionospheric</b> <b>index</b> f n F 2 is {{proposed}} {{to define the}} normal level of the undisturbed ionosphere. For the determination of this index a model is developed where the normal values of the f 0 F 2 parameter were reproduced using multiple regression analysis. For each month of the year, for a given station, a set of 48 or 72 coefficients are calculated, depending on the monthly sunspot activity. Then, the normal values of the f 0 F 2 parameter are computed {{as a function of}} the daily sunspot number. The analysis of the model results revealed the following characteristics for the f n F 2 index: first, the temporal variations that characterize the normal ionosphere, imposing some artificial effects on the monthly median values, are eliminated from the newly derived f n F 2 index. Second, the f n F 2 index does not follow the false steplike variations observed in the monthly median f 0 F 2 time series, in transition periods from one month to another. Third, during intervals of low magnetospheric activity,the f n F 2 index presents a very good degree of fit with the observed f 0 F 2 parameter, compared to the monthly median f 0 F 2 behaviour. During disturbed conditions, the f n F 2 index remains at the normal level, whereas median values are affected by ionospheric disturbances. In general, the data analysis showed that the f n F 2 index varies only with the daily sunspot number Rz and is independent of the magnetospheric activity, approaching the level of the normal ionosphere with a high degree of confidence...|$|E
30|$|The modeled monthly VTEC {{values are}} larger than the {{corresponding}} measured values for all months in 2009 and 2010. For instance, when the NeQuick and IRI- 2001 options are used, the largest deviations observed for August 2009 will be around 43 and 210  %, respectively (top right panel of Fig.  5). During 2010, {{there is a good}} agreement between the modeled and experimental monthly VTEC values for March (especially in using the NeQuick option). However, in other months, the model is found to entirely overestimate the monthly VTEC values, with the highest overestimation (by about 140  %) observed for June when the IRI- 2001 option is used. However, overestimation of the VTEC values by the model decreases as the Sun shifts from low to high solar activity (see Figs.  5, 6, and 7). This could be due to a misrepresentation of solar activity trends in the IRI model for the height maximum of the F 2 layer (hmF 2) (Bilitza et al. 2012). According to their findings, the discrepancy in the IRI model increases when solar activity moves toward a solar minimum; however, good agreement between the IRI model and ionosonde data of the hmF 2 is observed during solar maximum years. Hence, the authors conclude that the sunspot number (Rz 12) is not a good index to describe ionospheric conditions during the solar minimum, particularly for the recent solar minimum, and they recommend using the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>index</b> (IG 12) for the hmF 2 model instead. Furthermore, Kakinami et al. (2012) describe that the overestimation of the TEC by the IRI model increases with a decrease of EUV irradiance (during low solar activity) and decreases with an increase of EUV (during high solar activity). As shown in Figs.  5, 6, and 7, as the Sun moves from relatively low (2009) to high (2011) solar activity, the modeled VTEC values increase more slowly than the measured values. As a result, the performance of the IRI- 2012 model in estimating the monthly and seasonal VTEC variations improves as we traverse from 2009 to 2011. Moreover, the overall monthly variation of the VTEC shows that it is generally better to use the model with the NeQuick option for topside electron density.|$|E

40|$|A techique {{for filling}} the gaps {{of the missing}} F 2 -layer {{critical}} frequency is proposed and applied for the derivation of the <b>ionospheric</b> weather <b>index,</b> characterizing the degree of disturbance at each particular station. A daily-hourly analysis of ionosonde observations of foF 2 for 16 stations at latitude range 37 &deg; to 70 &deg; N, longitudes of 10 &deg; W to 150 &deg; E, is performed during the solar minimum, 2006. Missed ionosonde observations are reconstructed by cloning data of another station. The process of gap filling considers hourly values of the F peak density NmF 2 (deduced from foF 2), normalized to the respective median, and assumes that this ratio remains {{the same for the}} parent and cloned data. It is shown that the correlation coefficient between cloned fcF 2 and observed foF 2 is greater than 0. 75 for the positive and negative ionospheric disturbed days during a year at solar minimum, independent of the distance between the stations in high and middle latitudes. The quiet reference is determined as a running daily-hourly median for 27 days, preceding the day of observation calibrated for a seasonal trend with ITU-R foF 2 predictions.

40|$|Existence {{of random}} electron-density {{fluctuations}} cause scintillation of radio waves on trans-ionospheric links. Ionospheric irregularities {{that account for}} scintillation may vary significantly in spatial range and drift with the background plasma at speeds of 45 m/sec to more than 130 m/sec. These patchy irregularities may occur several times during night, e. g. in equatorial region, with the patches move through the ray paths of the GNSS satellite signals. These irregularities are often characterized as either `large scale' (which can be as large as several hundred km in East-West direction and many times that in the North-South direction) or `small scale' (which can be as small as 1 m). In normal solar activity conditions, the mid-latitude ionosphere is not much disturbed. However, during severe magnetic storms, the aurora oval extends towards the equator and the equator anomaly region may be stretched towards poles extending the scintillation phenomena into mid-latitudes. In such stormy conditions, the predicted total electron content (TEC) may deviate largely from the true value of the TEC both at low and mid-latitudes due to which GNSS applications may be strongly degraded. This work {{is an attempt to}} analyze ionospheric scintillation using <b>ionospheric</b> asymmetry <b>index.</b> The asymmetry index is based on trans-ionospheric propagation between GPS and LEO in radio occultation (RO) scenario, using background ionospheric data provided by MIDAS.

30|$|An {{enhancement}} in rate of TEC change index (ROTI) {{derived from}} GPS-TEC data was also observed around Yamagawa after 1700 UT (NICT). ROTI {{is a standard}} deviation of time differential TEC in 5 min, often used as the <b>ionospheric</b> irregularity <b>index</b> with a scale size of several tens of kilometers in plasma bubble structures (Nishioka et al. 2008). The ROTI enhancement disappeared before 2000 UT, different from the spread-F signatures in ionosondes. We speculate that this difference is not due to the difference of sensitive scale sizes between ROTI and ionosondes but due to the difference of physical parameters that cause spread-F and GPS ROTI. ROTI is the standard deviation of TEC variations for time scales of 30 to 300 s. If the horizontal drift speed of ionospheric plasma is 100 m/s, this time scale gives the horizontal plasma structures with scale sizes of 3 to 30 km, which can also cause spread-F in the ionosonde signal. However, since ROTI is the variation of the TEC, it would be less sensitive to the bottomside variation of the ionosphere measured as spread-F.|$|R

In this work, we have applied numerical ray-tracing to identify the location of the effective scattering volume of the ionosphere and to estimate the <b>ionospheric</b> refractive <b>index.</b> The simulations show that the major contribution to the radar echoes should be provided by the Pedersen and/or escaping rays that are scattered {{in the vicinity of the}} F-layer maximum. This conclusion is supported by a statistical analysis of the experimental elevation angle data, which have a signature consistent with scattering from the F-region peak. A detailed analysis of the simulations has allowed us to propose a simple velocity correction procedure, which we have successfully tested against the SuperDARN/DMSP comparison data set...|$|R
40|$|Ionospheric {{perturbations}} can {{adversely affect}} {{the performance of}} Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). This {{is due to the}} fact that extremes in plasma density, their rate of change and spatial distribution may cause unusually high range errors, phase and signal strength fluctuations of GNSS signals. Hence, performance parameters of GNSS systems such as accuracy, availability, continuity and integrity may strongly deviate from their average behaviour. In the presence of extreme ionospheric perturbations the limits of one of these quantities can be exceeded and thus the functionality of the GNSS system is threatened. Reported are selected ionospheric events such as moving ionization fronts and severe scintillation events whose characteristic features may threat specific GNSS applications. The events are analysed by using observational data computed in DLR Neustrelitz by using ground and space based measurements of the ionosphere since more than one solar cycle period. It has been found that large signal amplitude fluctuations my cause even loss of lock. Statistical studies are performed to quantify the ionospheric threat by computing the occurrence probability of severe events exceeding a certain threshold. In order to quantify the ionospheric perturbation degree and to reduce ionospheric threats by early warning, the use of <b>ionospheric</b> perturbation <b>indices</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{dispersive}} {{nature of}} the ionosphere, dual frequency GNSS measurements may effectively be used to derive robust and accurate information of the ionospheric state under quiet and perturbed space weather conditions. Well established ground based and innovative space based GNSS measurements offer a unique chance for a permanent monitoring of the electron density structure of the global ionosphere-plasmasphere system under perturbed conditions. The analyzed storms propagate primarily from high towards low latitudes at the European sector. Analysis of GPS measurements reveals different perturbation types such as large scale ionization fronts, wavelike Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs) and small scale irregularities producing radio scintillations. Since strong horizontal ionization gradients {{play an important role}} in safety of life applications, gradient characteristics is considered using the available large data set. Strongest gradients are observed in North - South direction. To quantify the ionospheric perturbation degree in GNSS applications, preliminary ideas how to define an <b>ionospheric</b> perturbation <b>index</b> are discussed. Reported are scintillation measurements carried out at high rate GPS receivers located at high and low latitudes in Kiruna / Sweden and Bandung / Indonesia. The occurrence rate of scintillations shows typical dependencies from local time, season and solar cycle. It has been found that large amplitude fluctuations my cause loss of lock. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This letter {{proposes a}} novel {{extremely}} low frequency (ELF) radar for localized D-region (altitude< 95 km) ionospheric anomalies that have been generated by natural geophysical processes. The proposed system would use the former U. S. Navy Wisconsin Transmitting Facility as a distant well-characterized impulsive ELF source. Sample calculations that demonstrate how passive vertical E-field detectors could characterize ionospheric conductivity depressions of variable diameter located above Los Angeles are provided. These calculations have been obtained us-ing our recently developed three-dimensional whole-Earth elec-tromagnetic wave propagation model based upon the rigorous finite-difference time-domain solution of Maxwell’s equations. A key potential application of the proposed ELF radar system is the detection of hypothesized <b>ionospheric</b> earthquake precursors. <b>Index</b> Terms—Earthquakes, {{extremely low frequency}} (ELF), finite difference time domain (FDTD), ionospheric disturbances, radar, remote sensing.

40|$|The auroral electrojet, and {{associated}} current systems {{are an important}} source of the magnetic field observed on the ground, and in space. In main magnetic field modelling we'd like to minimise the influence of such non-uniform current systems. This is usually done using careful date-selection based on <b>indices.</b> <b>Ionospheric</b> equivalent currents derived independently from the ground and the CHAMP satellite {{have been shown to be}} in good agreement (Ritter et al. 2004). This offers the possibility of a non-index based data selection e. g. by estimating the ionospheric current density as a function of time and space ground based observatory data, and then selecting suitable time intervals for modelling.

40|$|Ionospheric {{perturbations}} {{can have}} a strong influence {{on the use of}} global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and other space-based systems. The detection and estimation of spatial and temporal variations of electron density in near real-time is challenging and subject to current research. Based on former studies on the Disturbance Ionosphere Index (DIX) [1], here we present preliminary results concerning its capability to deduce also directional information on horizontal structures of the ionospheric electron content. Related results are derived from GNSS data sets obtained over Europe during a moderate ionospheric storm in October 2011. Although being limited due to the uneven data coverage over Europe, the derived index indicates the potential of providing valuable information on the actual performance of GNSS applications. The index is designed to be reliable and robust and allows an easy and objective interpretation. The calculation of the <b>ionospheric</b> disturbance <b>index</b> is based on the Total Electron Content (TEC) which has been confirmed in many publications to be an outstanding parameter for quantifying the range error and the strength of ionospheric perturbations. The quality of the index is dependent on the density of the used GNSS data base. The shown analysis results are calculated using the IGS and EUREF GNSS reference networks. DIX shall be made available to registered users in near real-time via the Ionospheric Monitoring and Prediction Center (IMPC) just established at DLR ([URL]...|$|R
