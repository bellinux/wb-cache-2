40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for robot <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> <b>assembly</b> tasks. We consider that robot pro-gramming can be made more efficient, precise and intuitive if we leverage the advantages of complementary approaches such as learning from demonstration, learning from feedback and knowledge transfer. Starting from low-level demonstrations of assembly tasks, the system is able to extract a high-level relational plan of the task. A graphical user interface (GUI) allows then the user to iteratively correct the acquired knowl-edge by refining high-level plans, and low-level geometrical knowledge of the task. This combination leads to a faster programming phase, more precise than just demonstrations, and more intuitive than just through a GUI. A final process allows to reuse high-level task knowledge for similar tasks in a transfer learning fashion. Finally we present a user study illustrating the advantages of this approach. I...|$|E

However, there exist barriers for many laboratories to acquire two-photon microscopes. Additionally, if owned, typical systems are difficult to modify to rapidly evolving methodologies.

Here we present a detailed hardware resource and protocol for building an upright, highly modular and adaptable two-photon {{laser scanning}} fluorescence microscope {{that can be used for}} in vitro or in vivo applications.

In a validation study we demonstrate that the step-by-step structure of the visual instructions created by the tool corresponds to the natural event boundaries, which are assessed by event segmentation and are known {{to play an important}} role in memory processes. In one part of the study, twenty participants created instructions based on videos of two different scenarios by using the proposed tool.

40|$|Optical {{projection}} tomography (OPT) is an {{imaging modality}} that has, {{in the last}} decade, answered numerous biological questions owing to its ability to view gene expression in 3 dimensions (3 D) at high resolution for samples up to several cm 3. This has increased demand for a cabinet OPT system, especially for mouse embryo phenotyping, for which OPT was primarily designed for. The Medical Research Council (MRC) Technology group (UK) released a commercial OPT system, constructed by Skyscan, called the Bioptonics OPT 3001 scanner that was installed in {{a limited number of}} locations. The Bioptonics system has been discontinued and currently there is no commercial OPT system available. Therefore, a few research institutions have built their own OPT system, choosing parts and a design specific to their biological applications. Some of these custom built OPT systems are preferred over the commercial Bioptonics system, as they provide improved performance based on stable translation and rotation stages and up to date CCD cameras coupled with objective lenses of high numerical aperture, increasing the resolution of the images.

An automated motion planning subsystem computes a collision-free path for each part from its initial posture in a crowded scene onto its final posture in the current subassembly. Visualization of this computed motion results in generation of 3 D animations. The system also consists of an automated part identification module that enables the human to identify, and pick, the correct part from a set of similar looking parts. The system’s ability to automatically translate assembly plans into instructions enables a significant reduction in the time taken to generate instructions and update them in response to design changes. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the design, characterization and optimization of a low-cost additive rapid-prototyping tool {{head for a}} technology known as Fused Filament Fabrication for use in an educational curriculum. Building a 3 D printer represents an excellent educational opportunity as it requires knowledge in electronics, mechanics, and thermal-fluids engineering; this particular design also includes a flexural bearing, introducing students to a new and important class of machine element. Polymer flow through the extruder is modeled as pipe flow with pressure drops using Bernoulli's equation with viscous losses; the model predicts that the pressure required to extrude is proportional to 1 /d⁴', where d is the nozzle diameter. Three different extruder designs are considered; a piston-based design, an auger-based design, and a pinch-wheel design. The pinch wheel design best meets the functional requirements after comparing the designs based on factors such as complexity and controllability. Flexural bearings are selected to provide a preload against the polymer filament; HDPE was chosen to be the flexure material after considering factors such as water-jet machinability and yield stress to elastic modulus ratio. Thermal imaging shows that the temperature profile along the heater barrel is not uniform, with the largest variation being 80 ± 2. 8 °C in large part due to errors in heater wire distribution during assembly. An exponential relationship is observed between the force required to extrude versus {{the temperature of the}} heater barrel with the force required to extrude dropping to between 1 and 2 N in the range of 200 to 240 °C. This data suggests trade-offs between maintaining a reasonable extruding pressure and maintaining good build resolution and speed.

40|$|The {{field of}} epigenetics looks at {{changes in the}} {{chromosomal}} structure that affect gene expression without altering DNA sequence. A large-scale modelling project to better understand these mechanisms is gaining momentum. Early advances in genetics led to the all-genetic paradigm: phenotype (an organism's characteristics/behaviour) is determined by genotype (its genetic make-up). This was later amended and expressed by the well-known formula P = G + E, encompassing {{the notion that the}} visible characteristics of a living organism (the phenotype, P) is a combination of hereditary genetic factors (the genotype, G) and environmental factors (E). However, this method fails to explain why in diseases such as schizophrenia we still observe differences between identical twins. Furthermore, the identification of environmental factors (such as smoking and air quality for lung cancer) is relatively rare. The formula also fails to explain cell differentiation from a single fertilized cell. In the wake of early work by Waddington, more recent results have emphasized that the expression of the genotype can be altered without any change in the DNA sequence. This phenomenon has been tagged as epigenetics. To form the chromosome, DNA strands roll over nucleosomes, which are a cluster of nine proteins (histones), as detailed in Figure 1. Epigenetic mechanisms involve inherited alterations in these two structures, eg through attachment of a functional group to the amino acids (methyl, acetyl and phosphate). These 'stable alterations' arise during development and cell proliferation and persist through cell division. While information within the genetic material is not changed, <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> its <b>assembly</b> and interpretation may be.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the integration of automated fixture design and automated fixture assembly activities. This is an important requirement due to the continually growing demand for efficient and agile manufacturing technologies. The concurrent fixturing approach developed in this research provides a framework for the integration and capability enhancement in these two areas. A one to one functional mapping of workholding capability to the fixture design domain has been devised. This is utilized in the hierarchical development of innovative fixturing hardware solutions which meet automation, integration and concurrency criteria. Issues of cost, complexity and rigidity are addressed. A device <b>for</b> programmable <b>assembly</b> assistance to the operator is proposed. At the CAD based automated fixture design stage, the same functional mapping is utilized to impose workholding constraints on a 3 D solid model representation of the workpiece. Design criteria used includes modeling of cutter path interference and surface conditions of the workpiece. Accessibility, surface incidence and topological constraints of the workpiece are processed. Optimal placement of the workpiece over the pallet is determined by shift and scan evaluation of all constraints based on which the fixture layout is automatically generated. The design approach has been implemented using the TWIN solid modeler on a Silicon Graphics workstation. Very fast processing times are demonstrated for 3 D workpieces of industrial complexity, using fixturability algorithms developed in this research.
