40|$|Objective(s) There {{are some}} {{reports that the}} {{teratogenic}} effects of cyclophosphamide (CPA) can be prevented by application of antioxidant drugs and stimulation of the maternal immune system. Echinacea purpurea extract is antioxidative and immunomodulator drug. Mesna (Sodium 2 -mercaptoethane sulfonate) is used for decreasing side effects of CPA, especially hemorrhagic cystitis. In this study, we compared the prophylactic effects of mesna and <b>Echinacea</b> <b>extract</b> on teratogenic effects of CPA. Materials and Methods This study was performed on 32 pregnant rats that were divided into 4 groups. The first group (control group) received normal saline and the other groups received CPA (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally) on 13 th day of gestation. Mesna and E. purpurea extracts were administrated at doses of 100 and 400 mg/kg by IP injection, respectively, along with it and 12 hr later, after CPA injection. Rats were dissected on day 20 of gestation, embryos harvested and after determination of gross malformations they were stained by Alizarin red-Alcian blue method.

40|$|Abstract: Echinacea {{preparations}} {{are widely}} used herbal medicines for the prevention and treatment of colds and minor infections. There is little evidence for the individual components in Echinacea that contribute to immune regulatory activity. Activity of an ethanolic <b>Echinacea</b> <b>extract</b> and several constituents, including cichoric acid, have been examined using three in vitro measures of macrophage immune function – NF-κB, TNF-α and nitric oxide (NO). In cultured macrophages, all components except the monoene alkylamide (AA 1) decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated NF-κB levels. 0. 2 µg/ml cichoric acid and 2. 0 µg/mL Echinacea Premium Liquid (EPL) and EPL alkylamide fraction (EPL AA) were found to significantly decrease TNF-α production under LPS stimulated conditions in macrophages. In macrophages, only the alkylamide mixture isolated from the ethanolic <b>Echinacea</b> <b>extract</b> decreased LPS stimulated NO production.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the gastro protective effects of <b>Echinacea</b> <b>extract,</b> Green tea extract and Boswellia extract on a pyloric ligation-induced gastric ulcer. Six groups of rats were intraperitoneally pre-treated with saline as normal group, saline as ulcer group, 20 mg/kg of ranitidine as positive group, <b>Echinacea</b> <b>extract</b> (25 mg/kg, I. P), Green tea extract (25 mg/kg, I. P) and Boswellia extract (200 mg/kg, I. P) for 15 consecutive days before pyloric ligation. Gastric acidity, ulcer index and histology were assessed. Gastric homogenates were determined for Malondialdehyde (MDA) content, Glutathione (GSH) content in addition to blood Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity. Pyloric ligation elevated gastric acidity, ulcer index and malondialdehyde content, while glutathione content and superoxide dismutase activity were significantly decreased. Prior administration of extracts mitigated the injurious effects of pyloric ligation. Echinacea, Green tea and Boswellia extracts separately ameliorated all the altered biochemical parameters. These results were confirmed histologically.

40|$|The use of Echinacea as a {{medicinal}} herb is {{prominent in the}} United States, and many studies have assessed the effectiveness of Echinacea as an immunomodulator.

Echinacea is a widely used over-the-counter HMP, with proven immunomodulatory properties. Its increasing use makes research into its safety an urgent concern. Previously, we showed that Echinacea extracts and its alkylamides (thought to be important for Echinacea's immunomodulatory activity) mildly inhibit the enzymatic activity of the main drug metabolising CYP isoforms, but to this date, there is insufficient work on its ability to alter CYP expression levels. We now report {{for the first time the}} effect of a commercial <b>Echinacea</b> <b>extract</b> (Echinaforce) and four Echinacea alkylamides on the transcription of the major drug metabolizing enzyme CYP 3 A 4. HepG 2 cells were exposed for 96 h to clinically relevant concentrations of Echinaforce (22, 11. 6 and 1. 16 [*]μg mL− 1) or the alkylamides (1. 62 and 44 nM). CYP 3 A 4 mRNA levels were quantified using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Neither Echinaforce nor the alkylamides produced any significant changes in the steady-state CYP 3 A 4 mRNA levels, under these conditions.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Leishmaniasis is {{a disease}} caused by {{intracellular}} protozoa parasites of the genus Leishmania and is endemic {{in some areas of}} Iran. Echinacea purpurea is a native plant from North America {{which is one of the}} most important medical herbs known with immuno-stimulant properties. This study was performed to determine the effect of alcoholic extract of Echinacea purpurea on prophylaxis and treatment of Leishmania cutaneous lesions. Materials & Methods: In this experimental study which was conducted at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in 2009, eighteen mice were divided into 3 groups. Group one received Echinacea purpurea extract (200 mg/ml) in their water, for 2 weeks before parasite injection, while group two were first injected with parasite amastigotes, followed by administration of Echinacea purpurea extract for 2 weeks. Group three was the control group, which received parasites, but not the extract. The size of Leishmania lesions in the tail base, right and left foot were measured with vernier caliper. The lesion areas were calculated and the collected data were analyzed with SPSS software. Results: The mean of lesion size in each group of mice were compared and analyzed. No significant differences in the lesions size were found between the three mice groups. Therefore, Echinacea purpurea extract was not effective against Leishmania major based on the findings of this study.

A major safety concern {{with the use of}} herbal medicinal products (HMP) is their interactions with conventional medicines, which are often mediated via the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) system. Echinacea is a widely used over-the-counter HMP, with proven immunomodulatory properties. Its increasing use makes research into its safety an urgent concern. Previously, we showed that Echinacea extracts and its alkylamides (thought to be important for Echinacea’s immunomodulatory activity) mildly inhibit the enzymatic activity of the main drug metabolising CYP isoforms, but to this date, there is insufficient work on its ability to alter CYP expression levels. We now report {{for the first time the}} effect of a commercial <b>Echinacea</b> <b>extract</b> (Echinaforce) and four Echinacea alkylamides on the transcription of the major drug metabolizing enzyme CYP 3 A 4. HepG 2 cells were exposed for 96 h to clinically relevant concentrations of Echinaforce (22, 11. 6 and 1. 16 μg mL − 1) or the alkylamides (1. 62 and 44 nM). CYP 3 A 4 mRNA levels were quantified using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Neither Echinaforce nor the alkylamides produced any significant changes in the steady-state CYP 3 A 4 mRNA levels, under these conditions. In contrast, treatment with 50 μM rifampicin resulted in a 3. 8 -fold up-regulation over the vehicle control. We conclude that Echinaforce i...|$|E
40|$|The plant {{commonly}} known as echinacea, used widely as an alternative medical technique in Europe, is becoming increasingly popular in the United States. It is native to the central United States and, historically, {{is one of the}} most important plants used medicinally by North American Indians. Today, echinacea is primarily used for its immune–stimulating and anti–inflammatory effects. Recent studies have indicated that several of its active components–high molecular weight polysaccharides, alkamides, and echinacoside–are very effective in mediating these effects. The polysaccharides have been shown to induce acute phase reactions in humans, activate phagocytes in humans and mice, and protect mice against lethal infection doses with Listeria monocytogenes and Candida albicans (3, 5). Inflammatory responses have been proven to be alleviated by alkamide inhibition of the enzymes 5 –lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase, both responsible for arachidonic acid metabolism to leukotrienes and prostaglandins respectively (2). Echinacoside was shown to strongly protect collagen from free radical attack, suggesting the use of <b>echinacea</b> <b>extracts</b> for the prevention of skin photodamage (1). Increasing concentrations of <b>echinacea</b> <b>extracts</b> given to normal individuals and patients with either chronic fatigue syndrome or AIDS caused increased antibody–dependent cellular cytotoxicity and natural killer cell function (4). The long history of successful echinacea use both in the United States and in Europe combined with the research which is now coming to light prove that it is deserving of continued attention by scientists and especially by clinicians seeking alternative ways to help their patients...|$|R
30|$|Alkamides, {{caffeic acid}} {{derivatives}} and polysaccharides {{are the principal}} phytochemical constituents of <b>Echinacea</b> <b>extracts</b> (Bauer 1998). The potential active compounds of Echinacea are caffeic acid derivatives (CADs) such as cichoric acid, chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid {{have been identified in}} Echinacea species. Cichoric acid (a major compound in Echinacea purpurea) exhibits phagocytic, antihyaluronidase activity (Bergeron et al. 2002) and immunostimulatory properties (Choffe et al. 2000). It has also shown to inhibit HIV- 1 integrase and replication (Lin et al. 1999). The potential active compounds in Echinacea including CADs, alkamides, polysaccharides and glycoproteins exhibit various clinical effects such as antioxidative, antibacterial, antifungal properties and are also used for treating common cold and respiratory and urinary diseases (Barrett 2003).|$|R
40|$|Echinacea {{has gained}} {{considerable}} attention {{because of its}} increasing economic value and use as a me-dicinal plant. The genus Echinacea, Asteraceae, is represented by eleven taxa found in the United States and in south central Canada. Echinacea purpurea is the most widespread species (McGregor 1968) and the most widely cultivated medicinal species of the genus (McKeown 1999). Echinacea species have long been recog-nized as important medicinal plants and were used by Native Americans {{for the treatment of}} many diseases, including colds, toothaches, snake bites, rabies, and wound infections (Bauer and Wagner 1991). The pharmacological activity of <b>Echinacea</b> <b>extracts</b> has been widely studied with over 350 published studies to date (Briskin 2000) together providing strong evidence for an immune modulating activity of these extracts. However, little scientific research has been directed toward understanding the biosynthetic pathways of the several classes of compounds that are thought to be responsible for the biological activity of <b>Echinacea</b> <b>extracts</b> or the physiology regulating their accumulation. The transfer of foreign genes into plants has provided new ways to study regulation of development and biosynthetic processes. Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation is preferred because of its sim-plicity and efficiency in providing stable integration of transferred DNA into the plant genome. In vitro shoot regeneration of E. purpurea has been reported from petiole explants (Choffe et al. 2000 a) and leaf tissue (Koroch et al. 2001) while root organogenesis has been obtained from hypocotyl and cotyledon explants (Choffe et al. 2000 b). The objective of this work was to develop an efficient in vitro regeneration method and an Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation method for E. purpurea leaf explants...|$|R
