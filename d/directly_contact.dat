2500|$|The key {{defining}} {{attribute of}} SLiMs, having {{a limited number}} of residues that <b>directly</b> <b>contact</b> the binding partner, has two major consequences. First, only few or even a single mutation can result in the generation of a functional motif, with further mutations of flanking residues allowing tuning affinity and specificity. This results in SLiMs having an increased propensity to evolve convergently, which facilitates their proliferation, as is evidenced by their conservation and increased incidence in higher Eukaryotes. It has been hypothesized that this might increase and restructure the connectivity of the interactome. Second, SLiMs have relatively low affinity for their interaction partners (generally between 1 and 150 μM), which makes these interactions transient and reversible, and thus ideal to mediate dynamic processes such as cell signaling. In addition, this means that these interactions can be easily modulated by post-translational modifications that change the structural and physicochemical properties of the motif. Also, regions of high functional density can mediate molecular switching by means of overlapping motifs (e.g. the C-terminal tails of integrin beta subunits), or they can allow high avidity interactions by multiple low affinity motifs (e.g. multiple [...] in [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Experiments {{have shown}} {{evidence}} that the ligand-binding site {{is located at the}} interface of two adjacent subunits. The ligand binding site is formed by three loops (A-C) from the principal ligand binding subunit (principal face) and three β-strands (D-F) from the adjacent subunit (complementary face). The amino acid residue E129 on loop A faces into the binding pocket and forms a critical hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of 5-HT. [...] Loop B contains W183, a critical tryptophan ligand binding residue that contributes to a cation-π interaction between the pi electron density of tryptophan and the primary amine of 5-HT. [...] Loop C residues have been considered as candidates for the differing pharmacology of rodent and human 5-HT3 receptors because of their divergence between species. [...] The most important aromatic residue within loop C is probably Y234 that lies opposite to the loop B tryptophan in the ligand binding pocket and is involved in ligand binding. [...] Loops D and F are in fact β-strands not loops. [...] W90 in loop D is critical for ligand binding and antagonists may <b>directly</b> <b>contact</b> R92. The azabicyclic ring of the competitive antagonist granisetron is located close to W183 forming a cation-pi interaction. [...] Loop E residues Y143, G148, E149, V150, Q151, N152, Y153 and K154 may be important for granisetron binding. [...] The structure of loop F has yet to be clarified but W195 and D204 seem to be critical for ligand binding.|$|E
