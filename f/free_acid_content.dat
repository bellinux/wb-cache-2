50|$|Acid leach {{solutions}} {{from some}} copper mines can contain {{large quantities of}} Fe(III) as well as Cu(II). The “free acid” (sulfuric acid) content of these leach solutions is a critical process parameter. While thermometric titrimetry can determine the <b>free</b> <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> with modest amounts of Fe(III), in some solutions the Fe(III) content is so high as to cause serious interference. Complexation with necessarily large amounts of oxalate is undesirable due to the toxicity of the reagent. A thermometric titration was devised by diluting the aliquot with propan-2-ol and titration with standard KOH in propan-2-ol. Most of the metal content precipitated prior to the commencement of the titration, and a clear, sharp endpoint for the sulfuric acid content was obtained.|$|E

The pH and conductivity of the rainwater were measured immediately after sample collection. There is a strong correlation between the two free hydrogen ion concentrations (R 2 ≃ 0. 92) and an even stronger one between the conductivities (R 2 ≃ 0. 99). Statistically, there is no difference at the 0. 05 level of significance between the means of either the two free hydrogen ion concentrations or the two conductivities. The conductivity results suggest that the total dissolved solids in the two samplers is probably quite similar in magnitude. No relationship is observed between thee <b>free</b> <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> and daily rainfall Volume in either sampler, a result similar to that obtained in previous studies involving bulk fall at the KARC and wet fall in urban Hong Kong as a whole. A weak hyperbolic relationship exists between the rainfall volume and the conductivity, and their log-log plot indicates only a somewhat weak inverse linear relationship, with correlation coefficients of - 0. 60 and - 0. 61 for the two samplers, considered individually. Finally, the unbiased estimates of the product of rainfall volume and conductivity for the collocated samples suggest that the microscale variability (≥ 4 m) of the mean wet mass flux of total dissolved material in rural Hong Kong rainfall is negligible. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The Impala Platinum Limited Base Metals Refinery in Springs, South Africa, refines {{convertor}} matte containing {{base metals}} and PGM 2 ̆ 7 s (platinum group metals) using a hydrometallurgical process. In {{addition to a}} PGM-rich concentrate that is further refined, the Base Metals Refinery produces nickel (in powder or briquette form), copper cathodes and cobalt powder. Five leaching stages are utilized to remove the base metals and impurities from the PGM concentrate. The project described in this paper involves a radical redesign of the second stage leach autoclave {{with the aim of}} reducing maintenance costs and downtime, increasing throughput and ensuring a safer working environment. The second stage leach process at the Base Metals Refinery, produces a PGM-rich residue through the extraction of copper and any remaining base metals from the first stage leach solid residue material. Leaching is performed in an autoclave operating at a pressure of 600 kPaG and a temperature of 140 °C to 150 °C. Concentrated H 2 SO 4 is added to the feed to produce a solution with a <b>free</b> <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> between 10 and 30 g/L and a pH of less than 2. Oxygen is passed into the 1 st and 2 nd compartments of the autoclave. As a result of the aggressive, highly oxidizing conditions within the autoclave, the original design utilized a heavy wall carbon steel shell with lead lining and two layers of acid bricks. The bricks acted as a wear resistant material and ensured a low surface temperature at the skin of the lead lining, whereas the lead lining acted as a corrosion barrier to protect the steel shell. These brick lined autoclaves were heavy, maintenance intensive and prone to catastrophic failure. A radical autoclave redesign was needed to reduce the high costs of manufacturing, installation and operation. Finite element modelling was used to optimize the design and various high alloy materials were investigated for the application. Based on extensive test work, the carbon steel shell was replaced with duplex SAF 2205 stainless steel in the new design. The use of this highly corrosion resistant material, eliminates the need for the lead and brick linings and reduces the wall thickness requirements substantially, resulting in an increase in the available volume for the same external shell dimensions. The vessel is welded in circular sections to form an elongated, impermeable, cylindrical body, with several agitator nozzles and compartments. The first new duplex stainless steel unit has been in continuous operation for more than 24 months and its performance has exceeded the highest expectations. The design was so successful that a patent has been registered. The major benefits of the new stainless steel design include increased throughput, improved performance, less downtime and a safer working environment. Lead has been eliminated and replaced with a more environmentally safe material, and the total lifespan of the vessel has been extended. In addition, the autoclave project has made significant developments in advancing the field of welding and optimizing the integrity of welding quality standards in South Africa...|$|E

Samples taken at the be ginning of storage and every month thereafter were analyzed for {{moisture content}}, fungal population, aflatoxin and <b>free</b> fatty <b>acid</b> <b>contents.</b> Statistical analyses showed that moisture content, fungal population, and <b>free</b> fatty <b>acid</b> <b>contents</b> were signifi cantly higher in jute and polypropylene bags than in PE-dou,bled jute bags. No significant differences were obtained in aflatoxin contents among bag types {{but at the end}} of six months storage, toxin level in jute bag exceeded the 30 ppb limit. Polypropylene had second highest toxin level at 23 ppb. The PE-doubled bags ha d 17 and 19 ppb total aflatoxins for thin and thick films, respectively. The results indicated that the immediate packag ing of dried shelled peanuts at safe moisture level in plastic films with water vapor transmission rated of 1 g/m 2 / 24 hr or lower is recommended. This p ackaging will delay critical increases in moisture content, fungal population, aflatoxin and <b>free</b> fatty <b>acid</b> <b>contents</b> of peanut kernels at ambient storage conditions...|$|R
40|$|Prosopis farcta {{is one of}} prosopis species {{native to}} Asia whose origin is from India to Iran. In this study, three Persian {{mesquite}} grains has been study. Each oil sample was extracted by solvent. A series of physical and chemical tests including phospholipid, unsaponifiable matters, metals, <b>free</b> fatty <b>acid</b> <b>contents,</b> peroxide index, iodine values, color, induction period measurements and fatty acid composition were carried out on extracted oils. It was concluded that Garmsar farm (growing by itself in the farmland) sample has the highest amount of oil, unsaponifiable matters, iodine value and phospholipids, compared to other samples. Yazd region (growing by itself in desert) sample has the highest stability against oxidation. Mesquite seed oil samples growing by itself in the southern desert Garmsar has the highest iron content but the lowest <b>free</b> fatty <b>acid</b> <b>contents</b> and peroxide index than other samples...|$|R
40|$|P>The aim of {{the study}} was (i) to detect changes of dry matter, NaCl and twenty-two <b>free</b> amino <b>acids</b> <b>contents,</b> pH and levels of {{selected}} microorganisms in four layers of cheese (from edge to core) during ripening and storage period and (ii) to describe the changes of the above-mentioned parameters caused by early relocation of cheese from optimum ripening conditions to refrigeration temperatures. The number of mesophilic aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria differed significantly (P < 0. 05) during the experiment dependent on the analysed layer and ripening/storage conditions. The <b>free</b> amino <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> differed significantly in individual analysed layers of cheese and also according to individual ripening/storage conditions. The highest <b>content</b> of <b>free</b> amino <b>acids</b> was found in samples stored at optimal ripening temperatures. Cheese hardness was also analysed and the lowest one was detected in samples ripened under optimal temperatures for the whole period. Early release of cheeses into storage rooms with lower temperature significantly affected properties of these products...|$|R
40|$|Biodiesel as fuel {{is crucial}} for future energy sustainability. Feedstock {{selection}} is an important consideration for biodiesel preparation because of high amounts of <b>free</b> fatty <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> that hinders conversion. In present work, Jatropha oil {{was used as a}} feedstock for producing biodiesel. Jatropha oil was esterified using acid catalyst (sulphuric acid) by esterification process and reduces the <b>free</b> fatty <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> of Jatropha oil. Important variables are studied that affect acid value during esterification such as <b>free</b> fatty <b>acid</b> to methanol ratio, catalyst concentration and reaction time on were studied. Initial acid value of Jatropha oil was found 17 mg-KOH/g-oil and it reduces below 8. 1 mg-KOH/g-oil in 1 h under the conditions of 1 : 50 molar ratio of FFA: methanol, 20 wt % H 2 SO 4 of oil at 63 - 64 °C. Alkaline catalyst (Sodium Methoxide) was used for transesterification process to produce biodiesel using Jatropha oil as source material (reduced acid value) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBoth galactolipase {{activity}} and <b>free</b> fatty <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> {{are much higher}} in chloroplasts of chilling-sensitive plants (bean, broad bean, tomato and maize) than in those of chilling-resistant ones (spinach, pea and lettuce). However, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol content in chloroplasts of these two groups of plants relates neither to <b>free</b> fatty <b>acid</b> levels nor galactolipase activity. It seems that chloroplast galactolipase {{activity and}} <b>free</b> fatty <b>acid</b> level may be useful biochemical parameters discriminating chilling-sensitive from chilling-resistant plants...|$|R
40|$|Nuptial {{gifts that}} are {{manufactured}} by the male {{are found in}} numerous insect species and some spiders, {{but there have been}} very few studies of the composition of such gifts. If, as has been proposed recently, nuptial gifts represent sensory traps, males will be selected to produce gifts that are attractive to females but such gifts will not necessarily provide the female with nutritional benefits (the ‘Candymaker’ hypothesis). We examined the <b>free</b> amino <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> of the spermatophylax of the cricket Gryllodes sigillatus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The spermatophylax (dry weight) consisted of approximately 7 per cent <b>free</b> amino <b>acids.</b> The <b>free</b> amino <b>acid</b> composition was highly imbalanced, with a low proportion of essential amino acids (18. 7 %) and a high proportion of proline and glycine. The main <b>free</b> amino <b>acids</b> found in the spermatophylax appeared to act as phagostimulants: the duration of feeding on artificial gels by females was positively related to the <b>free</b> amino <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> of the gels. The results therefore suggest that males use <b>free</b> amino <b>acids</b> to ‘sweeten’ a relatively low-value food item. A possible function of glycine in inhibiting female movement is also proposed...|$|R
