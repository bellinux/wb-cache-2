5|$|NuScale is {{expected}} to be the first SMR to market, because its cooling is similar to the systems used in conventional power plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and $931 at a <b>gas-fired</b> plant or in excess of $1,800 for a <b>gas-fired</b> plant with carbon sequestration. David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma Gas & Electric, {{commonly}} referred to as OG (NYSE: OGE) operates four base electric power plants in Oklahoma. Two of them are coal-fired power plants: one in Muskogee, and the other in Redrock. Two are <b>gas-fired</b> power plants: one in Harrah and the other in Konawa. OG was the first electric company in Oklahoma to generate electricity from wind farms in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The South Australian Government {{has stated}} that the price {{increase}} due to the Australian Government's carbon price (in place from July 2012 to June 2014) was approximately half of that experienced by other states due to the high installed capacity of wind and <b>gas-fired</b> generation.|$|E
25|$|Coal and <b>gas-fired</b> {{thermal power}} {{stations}} and hydroelectricity are {{the second and}} third largest kinds of power generation in the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{first move}} {{to plug the}} United Kingdom's {{projected}} energy gap was {{the construction of the}} conventionally <b>gas-fired</b> Langage Power Station and Marchwood Power Station which became operational in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Below Chester {{water is}} also {{abstracted}} as cooling water by the <b>gas-fired</b> power station at Connah's Quay. Process and cooling water is also abstracted {{for the paper}} mill and power station at Shotton.|$|E
25|$|Power grids with {{significant}} amounts of dispatchable pumped storage, hydropower with reservoir or pondage or other peaking power plants such as natural <b>gas-fired</b> power plants are capable of accommodating fluctuations from intermittent power more easily.|$|E
25|$|During the {{electricity}} crisis in 2001, the government launched {{a program to}} build 55 <b>gas-fired</b> power stations with a total capacity of 22 GW, but only 19 power stations were built, with a total capacity of 4,012 MW.|$|E
25|$|The Irving {{family is}} also hoping to take {{advantage}} of deregulation of utility markets in the region by building natural <b>gas-fired</b> electrical generating stations and is currently building a liquified natural gas terminal near its Saint John refinery.|$|E
25|$|Electricity for New Haven is {{generated}} by a 448MW oil and <b>gas-fired</b> generating station located on the shore at New Haven Harbor. Pennsylvania Power and Light (PPL) Inc. operates a 220MW peaking natural gas turbine plant in nearby Wallingford.|$|E
25|$|Policymakers were {{accustomed}} to an energy system based on big, centralised projects like nuclear or <b>gas-fired</b> power stations. A change of mindsets and incentives are bringing microgeneration into the mainstream. Planning regulations may also require streamlining to facilitate the retrofitting of microgenerating facilities onto homes and buildings.|$|E
25|$|To provide {{affordable}} and efficient heating {{to the residents}} of the new post-war developments, Pimlico became {{one of the few places}} in the UK to have a district heating system installed. District heating became popular after World War II to heat the large residential estates that replaced areas devastated by the Blitz. The Pimlico District Heating Undertaking (PDHU) is just north of the River Thames. The PDHU first became operational in 1950 and continues to expand to this day. The PDHU once relied on waste heat from the now-disused Battersea Power Station on the South side of the River Thames. It is still in operation, the water now being heated locally by a new energy centre which incorporates 3.1 MWe /4.0 MWTh of <b>gas-fired</b> CHP engines and 3×8 MW <b>gas-fired</b> boilers.|$|E
25|$|This may be by {{increased}} photosynthesis (through {{practices such as}} reforestation / preventing deforestation and genetic engineering); by enhanced soil carbon trapping in agriculture; or {{by the use of}} algal bio sequestration (see algae bioreactor) to absorb the carbon dioxide emissions from coal, petroleum (oil) or natural <b>gas-fired</b> electricity generation.|$|E
25|$|The {{electricity}} {{sector in}} Argentina constitutes {{the third largest}} power market in Latin America. It relies mostly on thermal generation (60% of installed capacity) and hydropower generation (36%). The country still has a large untapped hydroelectric potential. The prevailing natural <b>gas-fired</b> thermal generation is at risk due to the uncertainty about future gas supply.|$|E
25|$|American Electric Power (formerly West Texas Utilities) owns a <b>gas-fired</b> {{electric}} generating {{power plant}} located at Lake Stamford. The plant has a generating capacity of 218 MW. When operating, water is pumped {{directly from the}} lake for industrial (cooling) purposes. The plant was put into inactive status and mothballed in September 2002.|$|E
25|$|An {{ignition}} system generates a spark or heats an electrode {{to a high}} temperature to ignite a fuel-air mixture in spark ignition internal combustion engines oil-fired and <b>gas-fired</b> boilers, rocket engines, etc. The widest application for spark ignition internal combustion engines is in petrol (gasoline) road vehicles: cars (autos), four-by-fours (SUVs), motorcycles, pickups, vans, trucks, and buses.|$|E
25|$|Natural gas is most {{commonly}} used for heating applications in homes and businesses but natural <b>gas-fired</b> power generation is also a significant component of the power supply mix, accounting for 8% of Ontario's power generation capacity, with 102 natural gas generating stations. This capacity is set to increase from 5,103 MW to 9,300 MW by 2010.|$|E
25|$|Peak demand {{refers to}} fluctuating, or varying, needs for {{electricity}} {{above and beyond}} base load levels. Added to this base load, the peak load raises Ontario's maximum electricity demand to 27,000 MW. This peak is typically met by oil/natural <b>gas-fired,</b> coal and select hydro-electric power plants. These plants can respond to changes in demand rapidly, but have higher operating costs.|$|E
25|$|The oxides of {{nitrogen}} are a natural product of the burning of gas in air and are produced in large quantities by <b>gas-fired</b> furnaces. Some factories in cities with particular air pollution problems will mitigate this by using liquid oxygen, however the logic of this given the cost in carbon of (1) not using regenerators and (2) having to liquefy and transport oxygen is highly questionable.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand (ECNZ) {{proposed}} {{to build the}} Stratford Power Station, a 400 megawatt <b>gas-fired</b> thermal power station in Stratford, Taranaki. ECNZ applied for a resource consent to discharge contaminants including carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Environment Minister Simon Upton established a board of inquiry under the Resource Management Act to hear and advise him on the proposal.|$|E
25|$|Light {{industry}} is {{present on the}} Island Carr and Atherton Way industrial estates. A 260 MW <b>gas–fired</b> power station, owned by Centrica, sits to the south–west of the town. A second, 40 MW straw–fired, power station has been approved for construction alongside. A significant number of residents commute to work in nearby Scunthorpe and Grimsby, although the town is not characterized as a dormitory town.|$|E
25|$|The Pimlico District Heating Undertaking (PDHU) {{first became}} {{operational}} in 1950 {{and continues to}} expand to this day. The PDHU once relied on waste heat from the now-disused Battersea Power Station on the South side of the River Thames. It is still in operation, the water now being heated locally by a new energy centre which incorporates 3.1MWe / 4.0MWth of gas fired CHP engines and 3 × 8MW <b>gas-fired</b> boilers.|$|E
25|$|Despite these complexities, most of {{the data}} {{indicate}} that wind energy {{is one of the}} most cost efficient sources of renewable energy but approximately two times the cost of coal generated power in 2006. When the costs associated with pollution are factored in it was competitive with coal- and <b>gas-fired</b> power stations even then. By 2014, wind had the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of any power source in Australia.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study from}} 1997, Delaware Solid Waste Authority found that, for same amount of {{produced}} energy, incineration plants emitted fewer particles, hydrocarbons and less SO2, HCl, CO and NOx than coal-fired power plants, but more than natural <b>gas–fired</b> power plants. According to Germany's Ministry of the Environment, waste incinerators {{reduce the amount of}} some atmospheric pollutants by substituting power produced by coal-fired plants with power from waste-fired plants.|$|E
25|$|According to the Energy Information Administration, New Hampshire's energy {{consumption}} and per capita {{energy consumption}} {{are among the}} lowest in the country. The Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, located near Portsmouth, is the largest nuclear reactor in New England and provides about 30 percent of New Hampshire's electricity. Two natural <b>gas-fired</b> plants and some fossil-fuel powered plants, including the coal-fired Merrimack Station plant in Bow, provide most of the rest.|$|E
25|$|The {{region has}} been in regular {{industrial}} use since the 1860s, first as a location of a powder magazine and small maritime industries along the steep shoreline and early industries such as Pacific Rolling Mills, and later the famous Union Iron Works plus shipyards and related production, service and shipping-related industries, coal- and <b>gas-fired</b> power plants and energy generating facilities that eventually became Pacific Gas and Electric (PG).|$|E
25|$|However, due to {{reducing}} {{demand in the}} late-2000s recession removing any medium term gap, and high gas prices, in 2011 and 2012 over 2 GW of older, less efficient, gas generation plant was mothballed. In 2011 electricity demand dropped 4%, and about 6.5 GW of additional <b>gas-fired</b> capacity is being added over 2011 and 2012. Early in 2012 the reserve margin stood at {{the high level of}} 32%.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, gas was {{discovered}} in Morecambe Bay, {{and to this day}} the products have been processed onshore at Rampside Gas Terminal in south Barrow. The complex is operated jointly by Centrica and ConocoPhillips. Directly adjacent to Rampside Gas Terminal is Roosecote Power Station which was the first CCGT power station to supply electricity to the United Kingdom's National Grid. Although originally coal-fired, the station became <b>gas-fired</b> until it was mothballed in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Power {{projects}} in 2016 include natural <b>gas-fired</b> combined cycle facilities for Panda Power Funds: the Panda Hummel Station Power Plant in Pennsylvania and the Stonewall Energy Center in Virginia. For Advanced Power, Bechtel {{is working on}} three combined cycle plants, South Field Energy and Carroll County Energy in Ohio, and Cricket Valley Energy in New York. It is also building the Keeyask Generating Station, a hydroelectric power plant for Manitoba Hydro in Manitoba, Canada.|$|E
25|$|To {{meet this}} {{increasing}} demand, Peru {{will rely on}} natural gas, {{which is the most}} cost competitive option among all other fuel types. As such, it is expected that installed capacity of <b>gas-fired</b> electricity generation increases from 0.3 GW in 2002 to 6.0 GW in 2030. It is expected that, from 2026 onwards, natural gas will acquire the dominant share in the electricity generation mix, reaching 44% in 2030 compared with hydroelectricity's 37% share for the same year.|$|E
25|$|Demographic {{trends and}} {{intensified}} industrialization have caused electric power demand {{to grow by}} 8% per year. The government's goal of 53,000 megawatts of installed capacity by 2010 is to be reached by bringing on line new <b>gas-fired</b> plants, and adding hydropower and nuclear power generation capacity. Iran’s first nuclear power plant at Bushire went online in 2011. It is the second nuclear power plant ever built in the Middle East after the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant in Armenia.|$|E
25|$|Including the two nuclear plants, Turkey Point {{operates}} three power-generating units. It comprises two retired 404megawatt fuel oil/natural gas/used oil/propane-fired generation units (Units 1 and 2), two 802 MWe Westinghouse {{pressurized water}} reactors (Units3 and 4), and a 1,150MW combined-cycle <b>gas-fired</b> Unit5. It serves the entire southern portion of Florida. With a combined operational capacity of 2754 MW, {{the site is}} the largest generating station in Florida and the sixth largest power plant in the United States.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{electricity}} generation stations {{located within the}} city. There were two natural <b>gas-fired</b> power stations (the 380MW Otahuhu B owned by Contact Energy and the 175 Southdown owned by Mighty River Power) have been shut down. Since {{there is very little}} generation north of Auckland, almost all of the electricity for Auckland and Northland must be transmitted from power stations in the south, mainly from Huntly Power Station and the Waikato River hydroelectric stations.|$|E
25|$|Adelaide derives {{most of its}} {{electricity}} from the Torrens Island Power Station <b>gas-fired</b> plant operated by AGL Energy and the Pelican Point Power Station, along with wind power and connections to the national grid. Gas is supplied from the Moomba Gas Processing Plant in the Cooper Basin via the Moomba Adelaide Pipeline System and the SEAGas pipeline from Victoria. South Australia generates 18% of its {{electricity from}} wind power, and has 51% of the installed capacity of wind generators in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Electricity {{generation}} is handled by Powergen, a privately owned electricity producer, while electrical distribution is {{handled by the}} Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission (T) a state owned enterprise. Powergen had one natural <b>gas-fired</b> generation plant located on Wrightson Road in Port of Spain however this plant was closed on January 14, 2016 ending 121 years of power generation in Port of Spain. Port of Spain is supplied by power from power generation facilities located in Point Lisas, Penal and La Brea.|$|E
25|$|China {{decided to}} close the last four {{coal-fired}} power and heating plants out of Beijing's municipal area, replacing them with <b>gas-fired</b> stations, {{in an effort to}} improve air quality in the capital. The four plants, owned by Huaneng Power International, Datang International Power Generation Co Ltd, China Shenhua Energy and Beijing Jingneng Thermal Power Co Ltd, had a total power generating capacity of about 2.7gigawatts (GW). The first power plant closed in 2014, two other ones in 2015 and the last one will close in 2017.|$|E
