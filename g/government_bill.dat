In the Reichstag, the SPD resorted to a policy of tactical compromise in order to exert direct influence on legislation. In 1894, the parliamentary SPD voted for a <b>government</b> <b>bill</b> for the first time ever. It reduced the import duty on wheat, which led to a reduction in the price of food. In 1913, the votes of SPD parliamentarians helped to bring in new tax laws affecting the wealthy, which were necessary due to the increase in military spending.|$|E

500|$|Pleydell was a Protestant, {{and he is}} {{described}} by P.W. Hasler as [...] "a religious and political radical" [...] under Queen Mary, and voted against a <b>government</b> <b>bill</b> in 1555 {{while he was a}} Member for Marlborough. This, combined with his previous offences, may have been the reason for his internment at the notorious Fleet Prison at the dissolution of Parliament that year. A fervent supporter of Sir Anthony Kingston in the House of Commons, Pleydell came to be associated with Sir Henry Dudley's plot to exile Mary and ensure the succession of the future Queen Elizabeth to the throne (a foiled venture which led to Kingston's unexplained death and Dudley's voluntary exile to France); the Star Chamber accused Gabriel of inciting riots opposing Mary's reign. He was therefore [...] "regarded as a ringleader" [...] of the conspiracy and claimed parliamentary privilege when the Star Chamber found him guilty during the Michaelmas term of the 1555 session. The charges were supported by a £500 bond and a writ ordered by the court, possibly a crown action to intimidate future opposition in Parliament. The Commons accepted his claim that his privilege had been infringed and sent a delegation led by Sir Robert Rochester on 6 December to the House of Lords in support of his immunity.|$|E
500|$|Stelmach {{ran for the}} Legislative Assembly of Alberta as a Progressive Conservative in the 1993 provincial election, {{defeating}} incumbent New Democrat Derek Fox in {{the riding}} of Vegreville-Viking. Stelmach {{became a member of}} the Deep Six, a group of enthusiastically fiscally conservative rookie MLAs; in addition to supporting Premier Ralph Klein's aggressive deficit-cutting, Stelmach practiced fiscal restraint himself, incurring low office expenses and declining a government vehicle. [...] During his first term, Stelmach served as Deputy Whip and, later, Chief Government Whip for the P.C. caucus. [...] As a backbencher, he sponsored the Lloydminster Hospital Act Repeal Act. This was a <b>government</b> <b>bill</b> that dissolved the then-existing Lloydminster hospital board in preparation for an arrangement compliant with both the Alberta government's new system of regional health authorities and the Saskatchewan government's system. Lloydminster sits on the border of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and the hospital, although built and operated by the Alberta government, sits on the Saskatchewan side. It passed the legislature with little debate. In 1996, shortly before an April by-election in Redwater, Stelmach was accused of [...] "pork barrel politics" [...] for presenting, along with colleague Peter Trynchy and P.C. candidate Ross Quinn, a large cheque to a local seniors centre. Stelmach said that he had only stepped in to help the riding after its MLA, Nicholas Taylor, had been appointed to the Senate.|$|E

500|$|While McKellen {{had made}} his sexual {{orientation}} known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, {{it was not until}} 1988 that he came out to the general public, in a programme on BBC Radio. The context that prompted McKellen's decision– overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career– was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local <b>Government</b> <b>Bill,</b> known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament. Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality [...] "... as a kind of pretended family relationship". McKellen became active in fighting the proposed law, and, during a BBC Radio 3 programme where he debated Section 28 with the conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne, declared himself gay. McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin. In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking. He has said of this period: My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [...] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps {{it would be all right}} for other people to be as well, gay and straight. Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.|$|E
500|$|Consensus in the Potteries {{was against}} coming {{under the control}} of Staffordshire County Council and the idea {{developed}} of the Potteries seeking to become a county in their own right. Accordingly, a proposal was submitted to the Local Government Board on 2 July 1888 {{for the creation of a}} county of the Staffordshire Potteries. However, on 9 July 1888 it was proposed to amend the bill to reduce the population requirement for county borough status from 100,000 to only 50,000, which if adopted would allow Hanley to become a county borough in its own right, and the rest of the towns would come {{under the control of}} Staffordshire. On 13 July 1888 Captain Heathcote, MP for Staffordshire North West, moved an amendment to the bill that [...] "he district of the Staffordshire Potteries, comprising the municipal boroughs of Hanley, Stoke-upon-Trent, Longton, and Burslem, the urban sanitary district of the Fenton Local Board of Health, and the urban sanitary district of the Tunstall Local Board of Health, the six towns comprising the Pottery District should be formed into a county". In response, the President of the Local Government Board, Charles Ritchie, proposed the matter be resolved by way of a provisional order bill in the next parliamentary session and that he would undertake to introduce such a bill. William Woodall, MP for Hanley, supported the amendment but accepted Ritchie's assurance. However, he was also bound to protect Hanley's interests and moved that Hanley be added to the proposed list of county boroughs under the Local <b>Government</b> <b>bill,</b> but would surrender that right if all of the Potteries were to become a county borough or county in their own right. Ritchie re-iterated his hope that the matter could be resolved by way of provisional order bill and with that both amendments were withdrawn.|$|E

During the debates associated with the Local <b>Government</b> <b>Bill,</b> Terry Davis MP (Bromsgrove) tabled Amendment Numbers 73, 74 and 100 which proposed maintaining Worcestershire and Herefordshire as separate counties. He also stated that the bill [...] "is not welcomed in Halesowen or Stourbridge or the county as a whole" [...] and [...] "The situation has therefore been reluctantly accepted in Worcestershire, and this group of amendments would not change {{this part of the}} Bill." [...] He said that whilst agreement was in place for Worcester to be [...] "included in the County of Worcestershire", the merger with Herefordshire was [...] "intensely unpopular", especially from within the neighbouring county. Dr. John Gilbert MP (Dudley) said in the amendment debate regarding the future of Seisdon Rural District that whilst Dudley has [...] "no imperialist ambitions. ... We have no wish to engorge Stourbridge or Halesowen. Although the merger is going through smoothly, {{as a result of the}} exercise of tact and co-operation on the part of all the local authorities and between and within all the political parties...". These amendments were defeated in the subsequent vote paving the way for the future [...] "Hereford & Worcester", as were with Amendment Numbers 294 and 295 which would have consented to the transfer of Kinver Parish from Seisdon in Staffordshire to the new combined Herefordshire & Worcestershire authority. In the accompanying debates in the House of Lords, Worcestershire Peer Lord Sandys said that Stourbridge and Halesowen's respective borough council's [...] "duly elected, are wholly opposed to being joined to the conurbation". He continued by stating that [...] "a reason for the support of the county council, which is wholeheartedly for the boroughs of Halesowen and Stourbridge in their opposition to joining the conurbation, is the question of the Green Belt." [...] which could become threatened by future development.|$|E
