40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the study reported in this thesis was to show whether fibre of value as a reinforcing agent in newsprint production could be produced economically from hemp and flax grown in Tasmania. This involved an integrated analysis of the whole potential industry, with studies into the key areas of crop production, pulp and paper manufacture and economic viability. Another {{objective of the}} study was to develop a computer model for simulating the growth, development and yield of hemp in response to climatic, soil and management inputs. This would enable the results of this project to be extrapolated to other suitable production areas and hence assist in the initial assessment of cropping potential and the identification of optimum site and management conditions. Of the nine hemp cultivars that were assessed, Kompolti and Futura 77 were the best performing, producing crops in excess of 2 m high and yielding up to 1500 g/m 2 of oven dry stem. The results from sowing date trials suggest that September is the optimum month for sowing hemp in Tasmania. Later sowings resulted in a reduction in stem yield associated with a shortening of the thermal time duration from sowing to flowering. Furthermore, van der Werf etal. (1996) reported yield declines from later sowings due to delays in canopy closure and a subsequent reduction in intercepted radiation. Sowings prior to September appear to be limited by premature flowering in response to short daylengths. In an irrigation trial conducted in north west Tasmania, significant stem yield differences were not apparent for irrigation regimes based on refill to field capacity at deficits down to 120 mm. Maximum bark yield was obtained from regimes based on a 60 mm deficit or less (water consumption of 535 mm). The stem yields under rainfed conditions were substantially below those of the irrigated treatments. Stem yield responded in a parabolic manner to plant densities ranging from 50 to 300 plants/m 2, with maximum yields at about 110 plants/m 2. The results from a flax cultivar trial showed that stem yields of selected European cultivars were superior to a number of older Australian cultivars, developed for the Australian flax industry during the mid 1900 's. The cultivar Ariane was selected for further field trials and produced crops with oven dry stem yields of up to 1000 g/m 2. Field studies with a range of sowing date and irrigation treatments demonstrated that flax could be sown from autumn through to spring, under either rainfed or irrigated conditions. Maximum stem and seed yields were from an autumn sowing with supplementary irrigation from flowering to late grain fill. The optimum seeding rate for autumn sown flax was found to involve a compromise between maximising yield and minimising the potential losses from lodging apparent at densities in excess of about 1000 plants/m 2. Lodging was not a major problem at the optimum seeding rates for spring sowings of flax. Controlled environment studies were conducted into the response of pre-emergent development to temperature, and the flowering response of selected hemp cultivars to photoperiod. Parameters, constants and functions derived from these studies, the field trials and from selected references, were then used to develop a hemp simulation model. The model adequately predicted phenology, leaf area and biomass production for cv. Kompolti grown in north west Tasmania. The Australian newsprint industry currently uses a mixture of locally sourced eucalypt, radiata pine and recycled paper pulps, blended with an imported kraft (chemical) pulp. The purpose of the kraft pulp is to reinforce the newsprint. The primary aim of the pulping trials conducted in this study was to investigate the potential of using flax and <b>hemp</b> <b>bark</b> and whole stem pulps as alternative reinforcing agents in newsprint production. The existing cold caustic soda (CCS) and thermomechanical (TMP) processes were trialled with a view to harnessing the existing infrastructure and expertise. Cold caustic soda pulp made from the bark fraction formed paper of very high tear index, but with lower tensile index and tensile energy absorption than would be desirable from softwood kraft. This limitation might be overcome by using a higher proportion of non-wood pulp in the overall newsprint blend or through breeding improvements. The use of pulping (& pre-pulping) equipment more suited to non-woods may overcome handling difficulties associated with excessive fibre length. Pulps were also made from the core fraction to assess its suitability as a supplement to the short fibred component of the existing newsprint blend. Whilst potentially suited for use as a short fibred supplement in newsprint manufacture, the properties of the core pulps are not currently in demand within the industry. Interest from the newsprint industry in taking the financial risk of adopting hemp and flax based pulps as an alternative to kraft, would require that the total cost be somewhat less than the imported option. Similarly, interest from primary producers requires that the gross returns from these crops are at least comparable with a range of crop alternatives. The minimum bark price (mill gate) that is likely to attract farmers would vary between flax and hemp and between growing conditions. Dual purpose flax grown under dryland conditions would require a separated bark price in the vicinity of 400 /t to 450 /t. Irrigated hemp and flax crops grown in the more productive north west area of the state would require a price in excess of about 650 /t. These minimum bark prices are not attractive to the newsprint industry at present. Future financial viability will depend on a number of factors, including: fibre yield and quality (eg bark proportion in the stem and fibre tensile strength properties) improvements, elevated kraft pulp prices, and the establishment of strong markets for the stem core fraction and the seed of flax...|$|E
50|$|As listed above, the {{papermaking}} process {{included the}} use of materials like <b>bark,</b> <b>hemp,</b> silk, and fishing net; his exact formula has been lost. Emperor He {{was pleased with the}} invention and granted Cai an aristocratic title and great wealth.|$|R
40|$|Tripitaka is the world’s most {{comprehensive}} version of Buddhist sutra. There are limited numbers of Tripitaka currently preserved, {{most of them}} present various patterns of degradation. As {{little is known about}} the materials and crafts used in Tripitaka, it appeared necessary to identify them, and to further define adapted conservation treatment. In this work, a study concerning the paper source and dyestuff of the Tripitaka from approximate 16 th century was carried out using fiber analysis and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The results proved that the papers were mainly made from <b>hemp</b> or <b>bark</b> of mulberry tree, and indigo was used for colorizing the paper. At the end, we provide with suggestions for protecting and restoring the ancient Tripitaka...|$|R
5000|$|Herer {{claimed that}} hemp hurds, {{which make up}} 60 to 80% of the stem dry weight, contain 77% cellulose. Van der Werf argued that is wrong. Cellulose content of hemp hurds {{has been found to}} vary between 32 and 38% (Bedetti and Ciaralli 1976, van der Werf 1994). Possibly, Herer {{confused}} the hurds, which form the woody core of the hemp stem, with the bark, which forms the outer layer of the <b>hemp</b> stem. The <b>bark</b> contains the long bast fibers which are used in textile manufacturing.|$|R
25|$|Currently {{there is}} a small niche market for hemp pulp, for example as {{cigarette}} paper. Hemp fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp. In 1994 there was no significant production of 100% true hemp paper. World hemp pulp production was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05% of the world's annual pulp production volume. The total world production of hemp fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons. This can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The cost of hemp pulp is approximately six times that of wood pulp, mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the Western world, and because hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (mostly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles. Another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production. While the wood products industry uses nearly 100% of the fiber from harvested trees, only about 25% of the dried <b>hemp</b> stem—the <b>bark,</b> called bast—contains the long, strong fibers desirable for paper production. All this accounts for a high raw material cost. Hemp pulp is bleached with hydrogen peroxide, a process today also commonly used for wood pulp.|$|R

He would say, 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was that of a common arrow, a curved arrow, a barbed, a calf-toothed, or an oleander arrow.'

5|$|While maps {{drawn in}} ink on flat silk cloths {{have been found}} in the tomb of the Marquess of Dai (interred in 168 BCE at Mawangdui, Hunan province), the {{earliest}} known paper map found in China, dated 179–41 BCE and located at Fangmatan (near Tianshui, Gansu province), is incidentally the oldest known piece of paper. Yet Chinese hempen paper of the Western Han and early Eastern Han eras was of a coarse quality and used primarily as wrapping paper. The papermaking process was not formally introduced until the Eastern Han court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121 CE) created a process in 105 CE where mulberry tree <b>bark,</b> <b>hemp,</b> old linens, and fish nets were boiled together to make a pulp that was pounded, stirred in water, and then dunked with a wooden sieve containing a reed mat that was shaken, dried, and bleached into sheets of paper. The oldest known piece of paper with writing on it comes from the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, Inner Mongolia, dated precisely 110 CE when the Han garrison abandoned the area following a nomadic Xiongnu attack. By the 3rd century, paper became one of China's chief writing mediums.|$|R
5|$|Although it is {{recorded}} that the Han Dynasty (202 BC– AD 220) court eunuch Cai Lun (50 AD– AD 121) invented the pulp papermaking process and established {{the use of}} new materials used in making paper, ancient padding and wrapping paper artifacts dating to the 2nd century BC {{have been found in}} China, the oldest example of pulp papermaking being a map from Fangmatan, Tianshui; by the 3rd century, paper as a writing medium was in widespread use, replacing traditional but more expensive writing mediums such as strips of bamboo rolled into threaded scrolls, strips of silk, wet clay tablets hardened later in a furnace, and wooden tablets. The earliest known piece of paper with writing on it was discovered in the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, where Han Dynasty troops had deserted their position in AD 110 following a Xiongnu attack. In the paper making process established by Cai in 105, a boiled mixture of mulberry tree <b>bark,</b> <b>hemp,</b> old linens and fish nets created a pulp that was pounded into paste and stirred with water; a wooden frame sieve with a mat of sewn reeds was then dunked into the mixture, which was then shaken and then dried into sheets of paper that were bleached under the exposure of sunlight; K.S. Tom says this process was gradually improved through leaching, polishing and glazing to produce a smooth, strong paper. Paper is used a lot.|$|R
