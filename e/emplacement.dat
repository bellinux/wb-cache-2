5|$|During the Second World War, Royal Artillery {{military}} fortifications {{were established}} at the beach end of the reserve, including two 6-inch (15.24cm) guns, five buildings, two pillboxes, a minefield, and concrete anti-tank blocks. A spigot mortar <b>emplacement</b> and an Allan Williams Turret machine gun <b>emplacement</b> were sited closer to the village. One of the pillboxes and remains of the beach gun emplacements were still surviving as of 2012.|$|E
50|$|Within its {{brickwork}} walls, {{were four}} cannon <b>emplacements,</b> two central, while the remaining cannon <b>emplacements</b> guarded the lateral flanks, yet not parallel. Between the <b>emplacements</b> are bunks for fuzilheres. On {{the eastern end}} of the structure was a small building that acted as a powder magazine and storehouse.|$|R

50|$|PFC Joseph C. Rodríguez was the {{assistant}} squad {{leader of the}} 2d Platoon. His squad's advance was halted by enemy hostile fire coming from 5 different <b>emplacements.</b> Rodriguez then took the mission upon himself of destroying these <b>emplacements.</b> He charged the <b>emplacements</b> and hurled grenades into each of the foxholes. Rodriguez destroyed the <b>emplacements</b> and annihilated 15 enemy soldiers. As a result, the enemy was routed and the strategic strongpoint secured. PFC. Rodriguez was promoted {{to the rank of}} Sergeant and nominated for the Medal of Honor.|$|R

50|$|The battery has an oval {{plan with}} four gun <b>emplacements,</b> which {{originally}} contained two 9.2 inch and two 6 inch BL guns. The gun <b>emplacements</b> {{are surrounded by}} a shallow ditch, which was originally defended by barbed wire entanglements. The rear of the battery was sealed off by an iron fence. The battery also had machine gun <b>emplacements,</b> {{and it was the}} first fortification in Malta to have these features.|$|R

5|$|Sir Arthur Churchman bought Orford Castle in 1928, and in 1930 {{gave the}} {{property}} to the Orford Town Trust; an appeal for money to maintain and restore it began shortly afterwards. During the Second World War the castle was refortified with barbed wire to form what was originally intended to be an anti-aircraft <b>emplacement,</b> with Nissen huts erected around the keep. The castle was instead used as a radar <b>emplacement,</b> and a concrete floor was installed in the south-east tower to support the equipment. These buildings were removed {{at the end of}} the conflict.|$|E

50|$|One may {{visit the}} gun <b>emplacements</b> at any time. Two cannon barrels {{recovered}} from {{the foot of the}} nearby cliffs are on display in one of the <b>emplacements.</b> These two salvaged barrels were not originally located at Moltke.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{armed with}} ten 24-pounder cannon, the Redoubt was remodelled {{in order to}} {{accommodate}} increasingly heavy guns, as technology and the perceived threat changed. In 1861-2, work was carried out to accommodate 68-pounder cannon, and the <b>emplacements</b> were strengthened (by adding granite facing) to withstand improved enemy artillery. Only a decade later in 1872, three of the <b>emplacements</b> were altered to take enormous 12 ton RML(Rifled Muzzle Loading) guns. In 1903, three <b>emplacements</b> received 12 pounder QF(quick firing) guns.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} <b>emplacements,</b> nineteen 64 pounder (29 kg) RML artillery {{pieces were}} almost completely demolished in 1894 when concrete <b>emplacements</b> for three disappearing guns and two quick firing guns were built. A mining station was added in 1886 and searchlights followed in 1907.|$|R
5|$|No. 1 Bastion – a demi-bastion {{linked to}} a tenaille, forming Point Battery. It {{originally}} contained an echaugette but this was dismantled {{to make way for}} a directing station for the Brennan Torpedo System. A gun <b>emplacement</b> for a RML 12.5 inch 38 ton gun is located on the bastion's face.|$|E
5|$|Only 160 {{men out of}} the 600 {{members of}} the 9th Battalion tasked with {{eliminating}} the enemy battery at Merville arrived at the rendezvous point. Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway, {{in charge of the}} operation, decided to proceed regardless, as the <b>emplacement</b> had to be destroyed by 06:00 to prevent it firing on the invasion fleet and the troops arriving on Sword Beach. In the Battle of Merville Gun Battery, Allied forces disabled the guns with plastic explosives at a cost of 75 casualties. The <b>emplacement</b> was found to contain 75mm guns rather than the expected 150mm heavy coastal artillery. Otway's remaining force withdrew with the assistance of a few members of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion.|$|E
5|$|The guns {{mounted in}} the open battery were lighter {{than those in the}} casemates and were not {{enclosed}} but traversed on rails in the open air. A covered section between each <b>emplacement</b> led to an ammunition lift shaft up which the shells and cartridges were raised using lifting gear that still survives.|$|E

500|$|On February 19, Sergeant Cole led {{his machine}} gun section ashore in the D-Day assault of Iwo Jima. Moving {{forward with the}} initial assault wave, a hail of fire from two enemy <b>emplacements</b> halted his section's advance. Sergeant Cole {{personally}} destroyed them with hand grenades. His unit continued to advance until pinned down {{for a second time}} by enemy fire from three Japanese gun <b>emplacements.</b> One of these <b>emplacements</b> was destroyed by a machine-gunner in Cole's squad. When his machine guns jammed, armed only with a pistol and one hand grenade, Sergeant Cole made a one-man attack against the two remaining gun <b>emplacements.</b> Twice he returned to his own lines for additional grenades and continued the attack under fierce enemy fire until he had succeeded in destroying the enemy strong points.|$|R
50|$|The two gun <b>emplacements</b> are {{constructed}} from reinforced concrete and consist of an enclosed gun platform with metal blast doors and rooms beneath which are actually underground. The <b>emplacements</b> were originally situated behind the first dunes however as the beach has lost sand due to erosion the <b>emplacements</b> are now {{close to the}} tide line. Most of the walls have shifted and tilted as the erosion has undermined the gun platforms and the platforms on both <b>emplacements</b> have separated from the rear sections and tipped forwarded onto the beach. As erosion proceeds, the potential for ongoing collapse is high. In addition, structural timbers have become decayed, been destroyed by fires, or have been removed. The lack of structural support means that walls are not tied together and are in an advanced state of collapse.|$|R
5|$|A gun <b>emplacement</b> is a {{position}} or platform specially prepared to support large heavy guns and artillery. The first type of gun put on Fort Pasir Panjang was the 7-inch Rifled Muzzle-Loading (R.M.L.). Two of these guns were first installed in 1878 {{so as to}} provide a temporary defence for the fort. They were, however, removed soon after.|$|E
5|$|After {{an initial}} {{explosive}} eruption, extrusion of gas-depleted dacite magma commonly forms lava domes. Growing lava domes are inherently unstable, and collapse of their steep sides often generates pyroclastic flows of lava blocks and ash that can travel several miles. Such {{a sequence of}} events is recorded by the deposits related to the <b>emplacement</b> of Chaos Crags domes between 1,100 and 1,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|An {{embankment}} dam {{is a massive}} artificial water barrier. It is typically created by the <b>emplacement</b> and compaction of a complex semi-plastic mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such a dam impervious to surface or seepage erosion.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, gun {{batteries}} {{were built}} on the island. A twin six pounder <b>emplacement</b> at Galtness Battery on the coast at Salt Ness protected the Wide Firth from German torpedo boats. A Castle Battery was operational from 1941–43, as was an anti-aircraft battery. Mains electricity arrived on Shapinsay in the 1970s, when an underwater cable was laid from Kirkwall.|$|E
5|$|Elevation rise {{across the}} park results from land uplift along the Burnside-Eden fault zone. This zone {{is a major}} land fault {{separating}} the Adelaide Plains from the Mount Lofty Ranges and runs north-north-east across the park from its southwest corner. The park is underlain by neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Burra Group overlying a Precambrian crystalline basement. Sediments were formed approximately 700million years ago (mya) from sand washed into a shallow sea. Sand layers were then folded and slightly metamorphosed during the delamerian orogeny, a period of mountain building caused by tectonic plate movements and resulting east–west compression of Australia. This pushed up a mountain range, {{on the site of}} the present Mount Lofty Ranges, approximately 450mya. The range was eroded to a level plain over the following 350million years. Approximately 40mya, the location of today's ranges and plains were flat, with a hard sedimentary capping. About 2mya, block faulting raised the Mount Lofty Ranges, and much of the former land surface west of the ranges eroded away. The Gun <b>Emplacement</b> is a small remnant of this pre-erosion surface. It is a raised semi-circular flat area and has views over much of Adelaide from the southwestern corner of the park. The <b>Emplacement</b> is seen as an important regolith deposit, particularly for its role in understanding Adelaide's landscape's evolution. The <b>Emplacement</b> was declared a Geological Monument in 1978 for this geologic importance as well as its aesthetic and recreational value.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>emplacement</b> of late Pliocene lava domes, lesser {{activity}} {{continued into}} the Quaternary period (2.58 million years ago to present). Initial volcanism began on {{the summit of the}} volcano, depositing lava in and adjacent to the Level Mountain Range. This activity is indirectly dated as Pleistocene age , on the bases of the presence of subglacial and/or intraglacial deposits. Meszah Peak, the highest point of both Level Mountain and the Level Mountain Range, was volcanically active during this eruptive period.|$|E
