OH-PBDEs are toxic to adult and developing zebrafish and shown to be potent disruptors of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Disturbed OXPHOS can result in altered energy metabolism and weight loss. In herring, the concentration of OH-PBDEs (i. e. 2 '-OH-BDE 68 and 6 -OH-BDE 47) has increased during the period 1980 - 2010 in the Baltic Proper.
