25|$|The FirstEnergy Dam {{was built}} by the Northern Ohio Traction and Light Co. in 1912 to serve the dual {{functions}} of generating hydropower for its local streetcar system and providing cooling-water storage for a coal-burning power plant; however, the hydropower operation was discontinued in 1958, and the coal-burning plant was decommissioned in 1991. Some environmental groups and recreational groups want the dam removed. Others contend such an effort would be expensive and complicated, {{for at least two}} reasons: first, the formerly <b>hollow</b> <b>dam</b> was filled in with concrete in the early 1990s, and second, because of the industrial history of Cuyahoga Falls, the sediment upstream of the dam is expected to contain hazardous chemicals, possibly including heavy metals and PCBs. The Ohio EPA estimated removal of the dam would cost $5–10 million, and removal of the contaminated sediments $60 million. The dam is licensed through 2041.|$|E

5000|$|... ==History== SR 325 west of Byrdstown was {{originally}} {{a part of}} SR 53 {{that served as a}} direct route to Byrdstown to Celina, in Clay County until sometime around 1942-43, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers impounded the Obey River to create Dale <b>Hollow</b> Lake. The <b>dam</b> was built just off the current SR 53. The lake’s formation disconnected the roadway between the two cities, and parts of SR 53 in that area is now under water. After the dam was built in Clay County, SR 53 was rerouted to the Kentucky state line to become a then-new alignment of KY 61, which also followed a path directly into the lake.As a result, the quickest way to get from Celina to Byrdstown is to drive a route from the two cities via Livingston, in Overton County using State Routes 52 and 111.|$|R
50|$|Originally, Haweswater was {{a natural}} lake about four {{kilometres}} long, nearly divided by a tongue of land at Measand; the two reaches of the lake were known as High Water and Low Water. The building of the dam raised the water level by 29 metres (95 feet) and created a reservoir six kilometres (four miles) long and around 600 metres (almost half a mile) wide. The dam wall measures 470 metres long and 27.5 metres high; {{at the time of}} construction it was considered to be cutting-edge technology as it was the world's first <b>hollow</b> buttress <b>dam,</b> using 44 separate buttressed units joined by flexible joints. A parapet, 1.4 metres (56 inches) wide, runs the length of the dam and from this, tunnelled supplies can be seen entering the reservoir from the adjoining valleys of Heltondale and Swindale. When the reservoir is full, it holds 84 billion litres (18.6 billion gallons) of water. The reservoir is now owned by United Utilities PLC. It supplies about 25% of the North West's water supply.Before the valley was flooded in 1935, all the farms and dwellings of the villages of Mardale Green and Measand were demolished, as well as the centuries-old Dun Bull Inn at Mardale Green. The village church was dismantled and the stone used in constructing the dam; all the bodies in the churchyard were exhumed and re-buried at Shap. Today, when the water in the reservoir is low, the remains of the submerged village of Mardale Green can still be seen, including stone walls and the village bridge.|$|R

Its owner, {{president}} of the Otter Tail Power Company Vernon Wright, received enough advance warning to reach his dam by 6:15 a.m. and open the flood gates. Following the disaster, Otter Tail Power was engaged by the city to build their transmission lines into town. This helped spawn a local rumor, fueled by radical newspaper editor Haldor E. Boen, that Wright had deliberately destroyed City Dam by secretly distributing quicksilver from a rowboat to undermine it. Later it was determined natural springs under its foundation made the dam's failure inevitable.|$|E

40|$|The Mississippian (Kinderhookian-Osagean) Lodgepole Formation {{contains}} a diverse fossil assemblage. Taxa present include brachiopods, crinoids, gastropods, cephalopods, trilobites and corals. Corals and associated fauna {{were collected from}} four localities within the Bear River Range. These are, from north to south, Beirdneau Hollow, Spring Hollow, Leatham <b>Hollow</b> and Porcupine <b>Dam.</b> The well-preserved tabulate and rugose (compound and solitary) corals exhibit {{a high degree of}} morphologic variability. The colonial corals of the Lodgepole Formation (particularly Lithostrotionella, Syringopora) exhibit a morphologic gradient from platy to hemispherical forms. The six morphologic categories of colonial corals discussed in this study are identified by mean corallus diameter/corallum height ratios, by the corallite growth direction, and by the shape of the base of the colony. Type I corals have an average mean diameter/height ratio of 3. 4; corallites are directed laterally away from the flat base. Type I corals are interpreted to have been adapted to offshore, quiet-water conditions. Type II corals are flattened hemispheres; they have an average mean diameter/height ratio of 4. 1. Corallites are directed radially (i. e., with vertical as well as a lateral component) away from the flat colony base. Type II corals are interpreted in this study to have been adapted to shallow, moderately-turbulent environments in which vertical growth was inhibited. Type III corals have an average mean diameter/height ratio of 3. 9 and are similar to Type II corals in all respects but one, namely that there is an absence of corallites on the crown of the corallum. This feature is called balding and is interpreted in this study to have been the result of desiccation and subsequent death of coral polyps. Type III corals are thus interpreted to have inhabited very shallow water wherein subaerial exposure of the crown of the corallum occurred during periods of exceptionally low tides. Type IV corals are dome-shaped or slightly-flattened hemispheres; they have an average mean diameter/height ratio of 2. 3. Corallites are directed radially away from the flat base. Type IV corals are interpreted to have inhabited a depth zone intermediate between that of Type II corals (within or barely below tidal range) and Type I corals (near or below wave base). The average mean diameter/height ratio of Type V corals is 1. 7. Corallites are directed almost entirely vertically away from the rounded-to-conical colony base. Type V corals are interpreted to have inhabited areas where sedimentation rates were sufficiently high to encourage vertical growth to the virtual exclusion of lateral growth. Type VI corals are composite corals, consisting of combinations of hemispherical forms and platy forms. This morphologic type is characterized by a change in the direction of growth during the astogenetic development of colony. The combinations of varying growth forms presumably reflect fluctuations in sedimentation rate...|$|R
50|$|Center Hill Lake is a {{reservoir}} in the U.S. state of Tennessee. It {{is located in}} Middle Tennessee near Smithville. Created {{by means of a}} dam constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1948, the lake had a dual purpose: electricity production and flood control. Center Hill Dam is 260 ft high, and it is composed of concrete and earth structures, with 8 gates that are 50 ft wide each. Center Hill Lake is one of four major flood control reservoirs for the Cumberland; the others being J. Percy Priest Dam, Dale <b>Hollow</b> <b>Dam,</b> and Wolf Creek Dam.|$|E
5000|$|Crooks' <b>Hollow</b> <b>Dam</b> (alternatively, Dundas Town Dam) was a buttressed gravity dam, {{built of}} {{concrete}} in 1916 on Spencer Creek in Greensville, Ontario, Canada. About 100 yards upstream from {{the ruins of}} the much earlier Cockburn sawmill and dam, it replaced that dam in supplying water by pipe to Dundas for all uses. It also provided much greater flood control, and, more than the Cockburn dam, supplied a managed flow for water power users in the industries downstream. The Dundas Star commented on its completion: [...] "... an excellent piece of work. It is now hoped there will be no further difficulty about securing an adequate water supply for many years to come." [...] The dam was demolished in early 2013.|$|E
