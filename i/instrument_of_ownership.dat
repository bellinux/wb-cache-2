40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test two agency-based {{hypotheses}} regarding the effect <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> concentration on dividend policy using a large sample of Japanese firms. Design/methodology/approach – Level regressions associating payout rates to ownership concentration are run. Different measures of payout are used to ensure the robustness of our findings. Endogeneity <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> is taken into account. The choice <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> is carefuly motivated and their statistical power and exogeneity are checked. How ownership concentration affects the propensity to increase dividends following changes in variables correlated with free cash flows is also examined. Findings – The results are consistent with rent extraction by large shareholders. Ownership concentration is associated with significantly lower dividends in proportion to earnings as well as relative to book equity. An endogenous relation between ownership concentration and dividend payout is established, but the results are not statistically different. Firms with concentrated ownership are also less likely to increase dividends when earnings increase or when debt decreases. Practical implications – Large shareholders do not appear to use dividend policy to remove excess cash and impose greater financial discipline on managers. Instead, the results underline the conflicts of interest between majority and minority shareholders. Originality/value – The endogeneity <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> is controlled for using firm age and the industry's average ownership concentration as <b>instruments.</b> The effect <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> concentration on dividend changes following changes in proxies for free cash flows is also analyzed.

By 1998, this figure had risen to 15 percent. In major metropolitan areas, 50 percent of new housing units is being built and sold as part <b>of</b> a collective <b>ownership</b> regime. The rapid spread <b>of</b> collective private <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> American housing is creating a social revolution in local governance.

Private neighborhoods operate under different "constitutional" ground rules than traditional local governments in the public sector. The allocation of voting rights in private associations, for example, is based on property ownership rather than numbers of adult residents. The greater flexibility in governing arrangements of private neighborhoods has many advantages. The paper concludes by suggesting that collective private property rights should be made available to many existing neighborhoods in place of their current zoning controls. It would amount to the "privatization" of zoning. Housing; Local Governance; Collective Action; Community Associations; Privatization...|$|R
40|$|Property in {{an elusive}} concept. In many respects {{it has been}} {{regarded}} {{as a source of}} authority to use, develop and make decisions about whatever is the subject matter of this right <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b> This is true whether the holder of this right <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> is a private entity or a public entity. Increasingly a right <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> this kind has been recognised not only as a source of authority but also as a mechanism for restricting or limiting and perhaps even prohibiting existing or proposed activities that impact upon the environment. It is increasingly therefore an <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> control as much as an <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> authorisation. The protection and conservation of the environment are ultimately a matter of the public interest. This {{is not to suggest that}} the individual holders <b>of</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> are not interested in protecting the environment. It is open to them to do so in the exercise of a right <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> as a source of authorisation. However a right <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> – whether private or public – has become increasingly the instrument according to which the environment is protected and conserved. This article addresses these issues from a doctrinal as well as a practical perspective about how the environment is managed.

The section requires a copyright holder {{to sign a}} written <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> conveyance that expressly transfers <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> the copyright to the intended recipient for a transfer to be effective. Prior case law on this issue was conflicting, with some cases espousing a rule similar to section 204 and others reaching a quite different conclusion. In the 1942 New York case Pushman v. New York Graphic Society, for example, {{the court held that}} although a copyright in a work is distinct from a property right in a copy of the work, where the only existing copy of the work is transferred, the copyright is transferred along with the copy, unless expressly withheld by the author. Section 202 of the 1976 Act retains the property right/copyright distinction, but section 204 eliminates the inconsistent common law by assuming that the copyright is withheld by the author unless it is expressly transferred.|$|R

30|$|The {{dissociation}} {{of sense}} of agency and sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> is for sure, but how these two senses {{interact with each other}} is not clear enough. Data from behavioral experiments support the additive model, which indicates that sense of agency seems to promote the integration of the sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> pure sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> is fragmentary, and sense of agency can integrate different body parts into a continuum and form a unified body awareness (Tsakiris, Prabhu, & Haggard, 2006; Synofzik et al, 2008; Stein, 1964). However, brain imaging experiments are more supportive of the independent model, according to which sense of agency and sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> are essentially different experiences, triggered by different inputs, and using different brain networks, there is no direct overlap (Tsakiris, Longo, & Haggard, 2010). From our point of view, such inconsistency may lie in the experimental design. Since we usually experience sense of agency with sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> the role <b>of</b> these two types of experiences may not be separated in normal behavioral experiments. Through our research, we can find that when sense of agency and sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> were properly separated, the results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis proposed by the independent model. However, our findings do not support claims that sense of agency and sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> have no interactions. The interaction of modality and synchronicity {{had a significant impact on}} sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> rather than sense of agency, indicating sense of agency seems to increase sense <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> but not vice versa.|$|R
