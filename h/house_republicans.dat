5|$|Clinton now faced a lesser-known {{candidate}} in Lazio. While a relative moderate among <b>House</b> <b>Republicans,</b> Lazio had frequently supported former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a largely despised figure among many New Yorkers. Lazio did {{bring to the}} table an ethnic suburban background familiar to many New Yorkers, and had a reputation as an energetic campaigner.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Gingrich {{founded the}} Conservative Opportunity Society (COS), {{a group that}} {{included}} young conservative <b>House</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Early COS members included Robert Smith Walker, Judd Gregg, Dan Coats and Connie Mack III. The group gradually expanded to include several dozen representatives, who met each week to exchange and develop ideas.|$|E

50|$|After the 2008 elections, he {{was chosen}} as chief deputy {{minority}} whip, the highest-ranking appointed position in the <b>House</b> <b>Republican</b> Conference. His predecessor, Eric Cantor, was named minority whip. On November 17, 2010, he was selected by the <b>House</b> <b>Republican</b> Conference to be the House majority whip in the 112th Congress. In this post, he was the third-ranking <b>House</b> <b>Republican,</b> behind <b>House</b> speaker John Boehner and majority leader Eric Cantor.|$|R

5|$|Some <b>House</b> <b>Republicans</b> were {{critical}} of Thorne-Begland's {{lying to the}} Navy about his homosexuality, stating that his violation of the military's code of conduct made him unfit for a judgeship. Delegates also stated that they felt Thorne-Begland's homosexuality and previous history of activism would influence his rulings on the bench.|$|E
5|$|Although by tradition, Hastert was {{the leader}} of the <b>House</b> <b>Republicans,</b> he adopted a much lower profile in the media than {{conventional}} wisdom would suggest for a Speaker. This led to accusations that he was only a figurehead for DeLay. In 2005, DeLay was indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges of campaign-finance violations. DeLay stepped down as majority leader and was replaced in that post by Roy Blunt; DeLay resigned from Congress the following year.|$|E
5|$|<b>House</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{planned to}} hold a {{non-binding}} caucus vote on October 8, followed by the official floor vote on October 29. The winning candidate requires a 218-vote majority to win. Multiple ballots may be cast if {{the majority of the}} House cannot agree on a candidate. While McCarthy and Chaffetz both said they would vote for the winner of the caucus vote in the floor vote, Webster did not make the same promise.|$|E
50|$|Lankford {{defeated}} Democrat Tom Guild with 59 {{percent of}} the vote. Following the election, he was named chairman of the <b>House</b> <b>Republican</b> Policy Committee, the fifth-ranking position in the <b>House</b> <b>Republican</b> caucus. This is a very senior position for a second-term House member.|$|R
50|$|Leach {{was elected}} by his colleagues {{to serve on the}} Policy Committee of the Texas <b>House</b> <b>Republican</b> Caucus, which meets {{regularly}} during the legislative session to discuss and analyze legislation and to make official policy recommendations {{to the members of the}} <b>House</b> <b>Republican</b> Caucus.|$|R
50|$|In February 2006, Putnam {{became a}} member of the House leadership, {{assuming}} the role of chairman of the <b>House</b> <b>Republican</b> Policy Committee, the fifth-ranking Republican leadership position in the House. In November 2006, Putnam was elected by his colleagues as <b>House</b> <b>Republican</b> Conference Chairman, the third-highest ranking position. Following <b>House</b> <b>Republican</b> losses in the 2008 general election, he resigned his post as Conference Chairman. In 2010 The Florida Independent reported that Putnam had earmarked $100,000 for an abscission chemical used in citrus harvesting that The Florida Independent said would benefit his family's citrus business.|$|R
5|$|Chances {{the bill}} would be passed ended in November 2004 when <b>House</b> <b>Republicans</b> in the Pennsylvania General Assembly decided not to bring the bill to a vote. Later that year, Governor Rendell {{released}} US$30 million from the Redevelopment Assistance Budget to Liberty Property Trust. Through the state's Department of Economic and Community Development, Comcast received US$12.75 million that included a US$4-million opportunity grant, US$6.75 million in job-creation tax credits, and US$2 million in job training assistance. Despite the failure to gain KOZ status, the project received US$42.75 million in financial incentives from the state.|$|E
5|$|John Boehner, {{a member}} of the Republican Party from Ohio, served as the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives from February 2006 until January 2007. As the Democratic Party assumed control of the House {{following}} the 2006 elections, Boehner served as Minority Leader from January 2007 until January 2011. When Republicans reassumed control of the House of Representatives in January 2011, Boehner was elected as Speaker, with the votes of all 241 of his fellow Republicans. In 2014, some <b>House</b> <b>Republicans</b> reached out to Ben Carson about his interest in becoming Speaker should they be able to oust Boehner; Carson declined, citing his impending candidacy for president. Boehner's Republican opponents formed a congressional caucus, called the Freedom Caucus, in January 2015 to focus their opposition. Though Boehner was reelected as Speaker {{at the beginning of the}} 114th United States Congress that month, 25 conservative members of the Republican caucus did not vote for him. Daniel Webster, a Republican from Florida, received 12 votes.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, McCain {{said he was}} {{temporarily}} suspending his campaign activities, called on Obama to join him, and proposed delaying {{the first of the}} general election debates with Obama, in order to work on the proposed U.S. financial system bailout before Congress, which was targeted at addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and liquidity crisis. McCain's intervention helped to give dissatisfied <b>House</b> <b>Republicans</b> an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement. After Obama declined McCain's suspension suggestion, McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26. On October 1, McCain voted in favor of a revised $700 billion rescue plan. Another debate was held on October 7; like the first one, polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it. A final presidential debate occurred on October 15.|$|E

25|$|He was ineligible {{to run for}} {{a fourth}} House term in 2010 due to term limits. He unsuccessfully ran for Gallatin County Commission in 2010, being {{defeated}} by incumbent commissioner Joe Skinner in the Republican primary election. Sales' primary candidacy sparked an acrimonious and public rift among state Republicans: some <b>House</b> <b>Republicans</b> (such as Jesse O'Hara and Walt McNutt) strongly criticized Sales' leadership as speaker and minority leader, while other <b>House</b> <b>Republicans</b> (such as Tom McGillvray) defended Sales.|$|E

25|$|A {{weakening}} of the Democratic coalition {{leading up to the}} 1908 election allowed Republicans to make gains in the Oklahoma <b>House.</b> <b>Republicans</b> gained an even third of the legislative seats.

25|$|As Speaker, he {{was still}} {{the leader of the}} <b>House</b> <b>Republicans.</b> However, by tradition, he {{normally}} did not take part in debate, although he had the right to do so, and almost never voted from the floor. He was not a member of any House committees during his Speakership.|$|E
25|$|On January 14, 2006, {{he issued}} a release {{claiming}} {{that the majority of}} the Republican caucus had endorsed him as DeLay's successor. However, when the election was held by secret ballot on February 2, 2006, U.S. Representative John Boehner of Ohio won on the second ballot, with 122 votes to 109 for Blunt. In November 2006, Blunt was elected by <b>House</b> <b>Republicans</b> to their second-highest position during the 110th Congress, House Minority Whip. Blunt handily defeated U.S. Representative John Shadegg of Arizona for the position. He announced he would step down from the position in late 2008, following two successive election cycles where <b>House</b> <b>Republicans</b> had lost seats and to avoid a difficult battle with his deputy, Eric Cantor, who was urged by some to challenge Blunt for the position of Republican Whip.|$|E
