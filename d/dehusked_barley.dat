40|$|Arabinoxylans {{consisting}} {{of more than}} 90 % of arabinose and xylose were extracted from water-in-soluble cell wall material of <b>dehusked</b> <b>barley</b> grain, and degraded with a purified endo-(1 -> 4) -beta-D-xylanase from Aspergillus awamori. Twelve of the oligosaccharide fragments released were isolated {{by a combination of}} size-exclusion and anion-exchange chromatography, and their structures were determined by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. The oligosaccharides identified consisted of (1 -> 4) -linked beta-D-xylopyranosyl residues, some of which were substituted at O- 2, at O- 3, or at both O- 2 and O- 3, with alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl groups. Two new structures, a tetrasaccharide and a pentasaccharide, both containing terminal 2 -O-arabinofuranosylxylopyranose as a structural element are described...|$|E
