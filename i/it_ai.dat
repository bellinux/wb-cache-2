5000|$|Frieda Murray in her {{review for}} Booklist praised the novel calling it [...] "a {{marvelous}} thriller that plausibly extrapolates from current possibilities in <b>IT,</b> <b>AI,</b> media, and crime, it also constitutes {{the way for}} newcomers to get acquainted with Modesitt—at his best." [...] Kirkus Reviews was also positive about the novel saying [...] "Modesitt's abundant novelistic virtues--great characters and plotting, impressive attention to detail--aside: this is smart, aware, provocative, and engrossing on several political, economic, and professional levels." [...] Publishers Weekly said [...] "Modesitt strives for emotional rather than intellectual satisfaction. His future has much eye-pleasing chrome, but it lacks infrastructure, making the book seem more contemporary techno-thriller than SF (parents queuing up in hydrogen-powered cars {{to pick up their}} kids after school)." ...|$|E
50|$|It {{is unknown}} {{exactly how the}} surgery Professor Kasukabe worked, {{but it seems to}} have changed Ai significantly. He is not {{explicitly}} shown using Smoke when he fought Shin and Noi or En, but all three of them felt an eerie sense of disquiet when facing him. They feel it again when they encounter him six years later and recognise <b>it.</b> <b>Ai</b> seems to be extremely powerful, being a master of the knife and possessing extreme speed. He easily kills En in Volume 12, decapitating him. He later removes the Devil Tumor from En's head and surprisingly uses En's Magic against Shin and Noi, severely injuring them. The Magic, as noted by Shou, seemed much more potent than En's as even an Elite regenerative Sorcerer like Noi required a month to regain consciousness.|$|E

The TT is an empirical criterion: <b>It</b> sets <b>AI's</b> empirical goal to be to generate human-scale performance capacity.

40|$|Logical {{languages}} {{were developed}} for humans, {{with the main}} objective of stating what is a correct argument. Artificial Intelligence (AI) provided a new motivation and application domain for logicians. The main demand of AI to logics {{is to provide a}} formal language, a semantics, and a set of proof procedures that allow us to represent the various aspects of knowledge, and to reason about <b>it.</b> <b>AI</b> artifacts, such as robots, agents, “intelligent” programs, etc. act in a (sometimes virtual) world, and take decisions {{on the basis of what}} they “know” about this world. Here the need arises to be able to represent and use knowledge. Hence, speaking of Logics for AI largely means speaking of “Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. ...|$|E
40|$|Humans {{confront the}} {{unexpected}} every day, deal with it, and often learn from <b>it.</b> <b>AI</b> agents, {{on the other}} hand, are typically brittle—they tend to break down as soon as something happens for which their creators did not explicitly anticipate. The central focus of our research project is this problem of brittleness which {{may also be the}} single most important problem facing AI research. Our approach to brittleness is to model a common method that humans use to deal with the unexpected, namely to note occurrences of the unexpected (i. e., anomalies), to assess any problem signaled by the anomaly, and then to guide a response or solution that resolves it. The result is the Note-Assess-Guide procedure of what we call the Metacognitive Loop or MCL. To do this, we have implemented MCL-based systems that enable agents to help themselves; they must establish expectations and monitor them, note failed expectations, assess their causes, and then choose appropriate responses. Activities for this project have developed and refined a human-dialog agent and a robot navigation system to test the generality of this approach...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the results of {{different}} consumer surveys conducted between 2004 and 2006 with regard to consumers’ perceptions and reactions concerning AI in Vietnam, (mainly in Hanoi). The main results observed are as follows: A high proportion of consumers consider AI to be a food-related risk. However, over time,there has been a slight shift from a fear of consuming poultry to a fear of preparing it (slaughtering <b>it).</b> <b>AI</b> has {{had a profound effect on}} poultry consumption, even outside peak crisis times, more in terms of the quantity consumed (approximately a third less in 2006) than in terms of the number of consumers (6 % less). Blood and internal organs are considered particularly risky, while eggs are viewed as being safer. Poultry from industrial farms is considered to be more risky than poultry from small farms. Purchasing practices have also been affected by AI: in Hanoi, consumers declare that they prefer to buy poultry directly from producers that they know, or from supermarkets in the case of the wealthiest consumers. A high proportion still buy live poultry from market traders, but more consumers now ask sellers to slaughter it for them. With a view to lessening market shocks in the wake of the crisis while maintaining the priority of consumer safety, a number of measures should nevertheless be implemented: Risk communication should not over-emphasize AI as a food-related risk. Reliable safe distribution channels should be promoted (with reliable quality signs and controls) in order to encourage safe production and poultry consumption. Otherwise, a market recovery will only benefit supermarkets and large-scale farmers capable of supplying supermarkets. As numerous live birds are still slaughtered in urban market places, facilities should be provided for safe slaughter. At the same time, more attention should be paid to the provision of a real “cold chain” with a view to promoting the sale of slaughtered poultry...|$|E

40|$|Compiler {{design for}} stack machines, in {{particular}} register allocation, is an under researched area. In this thesis I present {{a framework for}} analysing and developing register allocation techniques for stack machines. Using this framework, I analyse previous register allocation methods and develop two new algorithms for global register allocation, both of which outperform previous algorithms, and {{lay the groundwork for}} future enhancements. Finally I discuss how effective global register allocation for stack machines can influence the design of high performance stack architectures. Included with this thesis is a portable C compiler for stack machines, which incorporates these new register allocation methods. The C compiler and associated tools (assembler, linker and simulator) are included in the CD.
