50|$|No wagering {{system can}} {{consistently}} beat casino games of pure chance such as craps, {{but that does}} not stop hopeful gamblers believing in them. One of the best known systems is the Martingale System, in which the player starts by betting a given amount, for instance $1, and doubles his bet whenever he loses. Upon winning, he starts over at the <b>initial</b> <b>amount.</b> The idea is to realize a net win equal to the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> after every eventual win.|$|R

50|$|Low {{base effect}} in {{business}} and economics is the tendency of a small absolute change from a low <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> to be translated into a large percentage change.|$|R
50|$|These {{are related}} as follows:where N0 is the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of active {{substance}} — substance {{that has the}} same percentage of unstable particles as when the substance was formed.|$|R
50|$|Melding is {{the act of}} {{displaying}} your cards face-up on {{the table}} to earn points. A team may only begin to place Runs onto the table if they meld a minimum number of initial points. This minimum <b>initial</b> meld <b>amount</b> varies based upon the total number of points already earned by that team in the Match. A team with less than fifteen-hundred points in the Match must initially meld a minimum of fifty points. A team with fifteen-hundred or more points in the Match must initially meld a minimum of seventy-five points. If a team fails to meld the minimum <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of points, then all the Runs are placed back into the Hand of the player and fifteen more points are added to the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> to meld for that team during that Game.|$|R
3000|$|In this case, Q 0 is the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of drug released, Q [...] t [...] is the {{cumulative}} amount of drug released at time t, and K 0 is zero-order release model constant.|$|R
25|$|An {{increase}} of 100% in a quantity {{means that the}} final amount is 200% of the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> (100% of <b>initial</b> + 100% of increase = 200% of initial); in other words, the quantity has doubled.|$|R
60|$|It {{was agreed}} to by all that a strict account should be kept of the <b>amounts</b> <b>advanced,</b> and he be allowed to repay the company at the {{earliest}} opportunity after he was under salary.|$|R

[...] Thus, in the above example, after {{an increase}} and decrease of , the final amount, $198, was 10% of 10%, or 1%, less than the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of $200. The net change is the same for a decrease of [...] percent followed by {{an increase of}} [...] percent; the final amount is [...]|$|R
30|$|PNBN was {{synthesized}} {{as described}} in the method. The LCST is 31.0  °C, and its recovery still reached 96.0  % at the five cycles with relation to <b>initial</b> <b>amount,</b> respectively. This shows that PNBN was stable after repeated dissolution and precipitation. After l-thyroxin was attached to the polymer, the LCST is 31.6  °C, with 0.6  °C rising. Recovery of PNBN–thyroxin was 99.6  % at the five cycles with relation to <b>initial</b> <b>amount.</b> Theoretically, the affinity polymer could be recycled more than 60 times if recovery is over 95  % every recycle. This new affinity polymer can reduce the cost in a large extent, and show great potential application in industry.|$|R
25|$|The excess {{dichromate}} {{is determined}} by titration against sodium thiosulfate. Subtracting the amount of excess dichromate from the <b>initial</b> <b>amount,</b> gives the amount of ethanol present. Accuracy can be improved by calibrating the dichromate solution against a blank.|$|R
3000|$|... where IMT (ng/mL) is the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of {{mycotoxin}} (AFB 1 or DON) in the digestion conical tube; UMT (ng/mL) is {{the residual}} amount of unbound mycotoxin (AFB 1 or DON) in the conical tube after digestion procedure.|$|R
50|$|The excess {{dichromate}} {{is determined}} by titration against sodium thiosulfate. Subtracting the amount of excess dichromate from the <b>initial</b> <b>amount,</b> gives the amount of ethanol present. Accuracy can be improved by calibrating the dichromate solution against a blank.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{mechanisms}} {{that can be}} employed to toughen a given material such as limiting the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of inclusions, dispersing small particles that will not initiate fracture, or the addition of plasticizers {{in the case of}} polymers.|$|R
50|$|The {{discount}} {{is usually}} associated with a discount rate, which is also called the discount yield. The discount yield is the proportional share of the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> owed (<b>initial</b> liability) that must be paid to delay payment for 1 year.|$|R
30|$|Since {{the groups}} are very narrow, the {{variation}} in their intensity increases {{with the increase in}} the initial surfactant content, indicating the intercalation of a larger amount of surfactant in the studied clay with the increase in the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of the surfactant.|$|R
5000|$|This can {{be derived}} by {{considering}} how much is left to be repaid after each month. The Principal remaining after the first month isi.e. the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> has increased less the payment. If the whole loan is repaid after one month then ...|$|R
60|$|The capitalist, then, may {{be assumed}} {{to make all the}} {{advances}} and receive all the produce. His profit consists of the excess of the produce above the advances; his rate of profit is the ratio which that excess bears to the <b>amount</b> <b>advanced.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In general, if an {{increase}} of [...] percent {{is followed by a}} decrease of [...] percent, and the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> was , the final amount is (1 + 0.01)(1 − 0.01) = (1 − (0.01)); thus the net change is an overall decrease by [...] percent of [...] percent (the square of the original percent change when expressed as a decimal number). Thus, in the above example, after {{an increase}} and decrease of [...] = 10 percent, the final amount, $198, was 10% of 10%, or 1%, less than the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of $200. The net change is the same for a decrease of [...] percent followed by {{an increase of}} [...] percent; the final amount is (1 - 0.01)(1 + 0.01) = (1 − (0.01)).|$|R
30|$|Substrate {{loss was}} {{determined}} after {{separation of the}} residual substrate on Whatman grade 2 filter paper and drying at 105  °C. The result was expressed as the percent of the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of feathers introduced into culture media, with the consideration of the initial substrates moisture.|$|R
50|$|The Government {{had refused}} any {{additions}} to the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> and asked the two councils that would be supporting Line One (Liverpool City Council and Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council) to make an agreement not to seek additional funding from the government if the project ran over budget.|$|R
50|$|Meynell {{was the son}} of an {{army officer}} and won a {{scholarship}} to Eton College. He was commended to Cyril Connolly when he arrived there as a boy with character. After an <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of bullying, the two became firm friends as described in Enemies of Promise.|$|R
5000|$|On 11 May 2006 CCB Plc {{signed a}} second Syndicated Term Loan Facility, whereas the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of EUR 11.000.000 was {{increased}} to EUR 27.500.000 {{with the participation}} of 12 foreign banks. The syndicated loan was arranged by HSH Nordbank AG and Raiffeizen Zentralbank Österreich AG.|$|R
30|$|To {{verify the}} {{influence}} of the effect of polymer content, it was varied between 10 to 20  mg/ml of organic phase, and the effect of the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of polymer on the particles morphology and size were studied. The results are concluded by graph (b) in Fig.  2.|$|R
50|$|Peel's investors include Redpoint Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Harrison Metal and TransLink Capital, {{from which}} it has raised a {{combined}} 45 million dollars. More recently, following an <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of 5 million dollars, Chinese internet giant Alibaba has invested 50 million dollars in Peel as of June, 2014.|$|R
5000|$|... where R0 is the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of R in the {{titration}} vessel, [...] is {{the initial}} volume, R is {{the concentration of}} R in the burette and [...] is the volume added. The burette concentration of a reactant not present in the burette is taken to be zero.|$|R
50|$|This system fails {{because the}} player will either {{run out of}} money after having to double his bet several times in a row after a streak of losing bets, or he will be unable to bet the amount {{dictated}} by the system because it would exceed the maximum bet allowed by the casino. The Martingale system also only yields a profit equal to the <b>initial</b> bet <b>amount</b> every time the player wins. If the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> is small, the payout from each Martingale sequence will be just as small.|$|R
50|$|Isochron dating is {{a common}} {{technique}} of radiometric dating and is applied to date certain events, such as crystallization, metamorphism, shock events, and differentiation of precursor melts, {{in the history of}} rocks. Isochron dating can be further separated into mineral isochron dating and whole rock isochron dating; both techniques are applied frequently to date terrestrial and also extraterrestrial rocks (meteorites). The advantage of isochron dating as compared to simple radiometric dating techniques is that no assumptions are needed about the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of the daughter nuclide in the radioactive decay sequence. Indeed, the <b>initial</b> <b>amount</b> of the daughter product can be determined using isochron dating. This technique can be applied if the daughter element has at least one stable isotope other than the daughter isotope into which the parent nuclide decays.|$|R
