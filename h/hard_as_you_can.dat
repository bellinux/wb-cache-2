500|$|After Robinson's hire as manager, Doby {{returned}} {{to work for the}} Expos. In 1976, Bill Veeck purchased the White Sox for a second time and hired Doby to be the team's batting coach. As a team, the White Sox finished the 1976 season with a [...]255 batting average, 586 runs scored and 73 home runs. By June 29, 1977, the team's average was [...]284, and had recorded 382 runs scored and 87 home runs. They finished the season second in team batting average (to the Yankees and Red Sox, each with a [...]281 average) and had 192 home runs and 844 runs scored as a team. After firing the White Sox's manager and former Doby teammate Bob Lemon, Veeck replaced him with Doby on June 30, 1978. At age 53, Doby became the second black manager in the majors after Robinson. [...] "It's so nice to work for a man like Bill Veeck. You just work as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and if the opportunity arises, you will certainly get the opportunity to fulfill your dreams", Doby said after being named White Sox manager.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{ability to}} produce rapid muscle force and joint torque is {{important}} for performance in sports, injury prevention and rehabilitation, and balance recovery. One way to measure rapid torque production is rate of torque development (RTD), which is {{the slope of the}} torque-time curve. Interventions aimed at increasing RTD are of interest. Adopting an external focus of attention, which is focused on one’s environment, has been found to enhance peak torque production compared to an internal focus of attention, which is focused on one’s bodily movements. However, the effects of focus of attention on RTD is unknown. Methods: Thirty participants evenly split between sexes (age = 22. 1 ± 2. 6 years, mass = 78. 98 ± 11. 71 kg, and height = 173. 78 ± 11. 00 cm) completed a minimum of three and a maximum of eight trials of maximal voluntary isometric contractions of the knee extensors under both external and internal focus conditions. External focus instructions were, “While looking straight ahead, try to push out <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> and fast <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> while focusing on the device arm. ” Internal focus instructions were, “While looking straight ahead, try to push out <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> and fast <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> while focusing on the muscles on the front of your thigh. ” Paired t-tests were used to compare the two conditions for both peak torque and RTD. Results: RTD was significantly greater during the external focus condition than during the internal focus condition (external focus 11. 16 ± 4. 98 N·m·kg- 1 ·s- 1 versus internal focus 9. 92 ± 4. 22 N·m·kg- 1 ·s- 1, p = 0. 0248). There {{was no significant difference in}} peak torque between conditions (external focus 2. 14 ± 0. 60 N·m·kg- 1 versus internal focus 2. 08 ± 0. 61 N·m·kg- 1, p = 0. 1887). Conclusion: An external focus of attention elicited a 12. 4 % greater RTD than the internal focus of attention. However, there was no difference in peak torque condition. This improved rapid torque production may be important in situations that require explosive movement, such as in sport performance and the prevention of injuries and falls...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} for transmitting the required secret information by embedding the information into the video after encryption through Salt Cryptography. A 512 bit key value is determined for encryption and positioning of secret {{information in the}} video. The encryption will be done depending upon a password. But along with the password some pseudorandom Salt sequences are also there. We will define salts which are random numbers needed to access the encrypted data, along with the password. If an attacker does not know the password, {{and is trying to}} guess it with a brute-force attack, then every password he tries has to be tried with each salt value. So, for a one-bit salt (0 or 1), this makes the encryption twice <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> to break in this way. A two bit salt makes it four times <b>as</b> <b>hard,</b> a three bit salt eight times <b>as</b> <b>hard,</b> etc. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> imagine {{how difficult it is to}} crack passwords with encryption that uses a 32 -bit salt!. Salts are stored separately from passwords. That way, even if an attacker steals the password database, it is almost useless to him (if the salt has a lot of bits). The purpose of a salt is to add arbitrary random data to the string being hashed, such that you increase the length of input to hash...|$|R
