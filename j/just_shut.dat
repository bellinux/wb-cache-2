He did all the songs with just an acoustic guitar, and later they overdubbed {{the rest of it}} around his tapes." [...] This is, in fact, completely untrue – the live tracks for the sessions were performed by Morrison on vocals and acoustic guitar in a separate vocal booth [...] with the other musicians playing together on upright bass, lead acoustic guitar, vibes, flute, and drums. The strings and horns constituted the only instruments added subsequently to the initial recording sessions.|$|E

Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times summed up her review by writing, [...] "Packaged with Naseeruddin as the adorable old man... and Kalki as the charming young, energetic woman, Waiting is a delight." [...] While acknowledging the [...] "underdeveloped and overwritten" [...] parts of the plot, Gupta was nonetheless appreciative of Koechlin and Shah, calling them good fits for their roles. Rajeev Masand writing for CNN-News18 offered similar observations; he criticized the [...] "weak" [...] plotting, but talked well of the characters: [...] "you yearn for them to <b>just</b> <b>shut</b> up and soak in the silence. Each time they do, the film soars." [...] Also lauding Shah's [...] "real" [...] and Koechlin's [...] "endearing" [...] performances, he wrote that Waiting, [...] "raises important questions about life, love, and letting go.

500|$|Hex Enduction Hour takes {{influence}} from the Velvet Underground's [...] "Sister Ray", Captain Beefheart {{and the early}} 1970s Krautrock band Can. Smith {{has said that the}} title was intended to invoke witchcraft, that he concocted the word [...] "Enduction" [...] to suggest the album could be a listener's induction into the Fall and that [...] "Hex" [...] was a reference to this being the band's sixth release. His vocals are higher in the mix than on previous Fall releases and were described in 1982 by Sounds as [...] "emerg like a loudhailer from a fog of guitar scratch". The songs were deliberately produced in a raw and low-fi approach by Smith, Grant Showbiz and Richard Mazda in a sound described at the time as a [...] "well produced noise" [...] that was acceptable by Fall standards. Critic Mark Storace claimed that he [...] "could {{have done a better job}} on a 4-track if I was pissed out of my head". Smith responded by saying that [...] "nowadays people just can't <b>just</b> <b>shut</b> up if they don't know what they're talking about." [...] Elaborating on the purposely amateurish production values, Smith remarked that [...] "it was all recorded in deliberately bad places...deliberately simple sort of thing.

[...] In response, Palahniuk (who had never responded to a review before) sent an angry e-mail to Salon's Letters section. Palahniuk observed [...] "Until you can create something that captivates people, I'd invite you to <b>just</b> <b>shut</b> up. It's easy to attack and destroy an act of creation.

The reaction was apparent [...] "in newspaper headlines, cable television and on YouTube. His phrase was reproduced on T-shirts, and cellphone ring tones. In Mexico City, the dust-up became a satirical skit, [...] "El Chabo del 8". In El Salvador's capital, the phrase became a playful greeting". In Australia The Sydney Morning Herald reported the king could earn a multimillion-euro business if he claimed rights over the phrase, which generated a Benny Hill Show-style skit and a Nike ad, [...] "Juan do it. <b>Just</b> <b>shut</b> up", with the Brazilian football star, Ronaldinho. Canada's CBC News said an actor's voice was used to mimic the king's voice in the ringtone to avoid legal problems {{over the use of}} the phrase, which also generated sales of coffee mugs.

5000|$|In {{devices such}} as two-way radios (also known as radiotelephones), the squelch on a local {{receiver}} can be adjusted with a knob, others have push buttons or a sequence of button presses. This setting adjusts the threshold at which signals will open (un-mute) the audio channel. Backing off the control will turn on the audio, and the operator will hear white noise (also called [...] "static" [...] or squelch noise) {{when there is no}} signal present. The usual operation is to adjust the control until the channel <b>just</b> <b>shuts</b> off - then only a small threshold signal is needed to turn on the speaker. However, if a weak signal is annoying, the operator can set the control a little higher thereby adjusting the squelch to open only when stronger signals are received.|$|R

2500|$|For Squad 5-O, {{the move}} to Tooth and Nail {{was more than just}} a change of {{approach}} in musical style. The band also began to move away from explicit references to Jesus, and to use metaphor more extensively. They also began to tour in more mainstream venues than churches, as explained by Jeff Fortson: [...] "Jesus said to be fishers of men; we have realized that you can't do that unless you're where the people who need him are." [...] Generally, the band was discontented with the state of the Christian music industry and Christian subculture, which they saw as exploitive and misleading. Jeff Fortson contrasted for HM magazine their experiences playing at a [...] "large Christian event" [...] and a secular one a few days later. At the Christian event (which was headlined by Steven Curtis Chapman) [...] "... the kids were coming out of the seats and standing in the aisles to come up and rock out with us...
