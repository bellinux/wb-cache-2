50|$|By the 1950s Vogel, {{feeling the}} shift in consummer's habits, decided to divided its brands into two. On the one hand, the company kept {{producing}} the luxury watches it was famous for. On the other hand, it started producing lower-cost watches that fitted properly the emerging mass consumption markets. Thanks to this new orientation, Solvil et Titus {{was instrumental in the}} development of mechanical and <b>electronic</b> <b>watches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some <b>electronic</b> <b>watches</b> are {{powered by}} the {{movement}} of the wearer. For instance, Seiko's kinetic-powered quartz watches use the motion of the wearer's arm: turning a rotating weight which causes a tiny generator to supply power to charge a rechargeable battery that runs the watch. The concept {{is similar to that of}} self-winding spring movements, except that electrical power is generated instead of mechanical spring tension.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>watches</b> require {{electricity}} {{as a power}} source, {{and some}} mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also require electricity. Usually the electricity is provided by a replaceable battery. The first use of electrical power in watches was {{as a substitute for}} the mainspring, to remove the need for winding. The first electrically powered watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was released in 1957 by the Hamilton Watch Company of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|The first digital <b>electronic</b> <b>watch,</b> a Pulsar LED {{prototype}} in 1970, {{was developed}} jointly by Hamilton Watch Company and Electro-Data, founded by George H. Thiess. John Bergey, {{the head of}} Hamilton's Pulsar division, {{said that he was}} inspired to make a digital timepiece by the then-futuristic digital clock that Hamilton themselves made for the 1968 science fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey. On 4 April 1972, the Pulsar was finally ready, made in 18-carat gold and sold for $2,100. It had a red light-emitting diode (LED) display.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, Seiko Spring Drive was announced. It was {{developed}} by Yoshikazu Akahane and his team and inspired by Yoshikazu’s vision: “a watch wound by a mainspring and with one-second-a-day accuracy, a precision that only the finest <b>electronic</b> <b>watches</b> could deliver.” This movement achieved high accuracy with 1 second per day, long power reserve (72 hours) with its special developed alloy, fast winding with the “Magic Lever” design and glide-motion movement with the watch hands.|$|R
50|$|The Central Movement Alert List (CMAL) is an <b>electronic</b> <b>watch</b> list, {{containing}} {{information about}} individuals who pose either an immigration or national security {{concern to the}} Australian Government {{as well as information}} on lost, stolen or fraudulent travel documents. CMAL comprises two databases, the Person Alert List (PAL) and the Document Alert List (DAL). The PAL database stores the biographical details of identities of concern and DAL is a list of lost, fraudulent or stolen travel documents. PAL records are categorised according to the reason for listing the identity—the alert reason code (ARC). There are 19 ARCs with each being categorised as high, medium or low risk.|$|E
50|$|Henshel's most {{successful}} product line was {{the introduction of}} the Accutron watch, an early <b>electronic</b> <b>watch,</b> in the 1960s and 1970s. The Accutron was different than previous watches as it did not contain a balance wheel or mainspring. The Accutron contained a battery-powered transistor circuit which sent impulses to a tiny internal tuning fork, which turned the watch's hands. The Bulova Watch Company guaranteed the Accutron to be accurate to within two seconds. The Accutron was a hit and major innovative and financial success for the company. The Johnson Administration used it as a common gift. Ultimately, the Accutron mechanism was adapted for use in the United States space program, including on the Skylab Space Station. Accutron mechanisms were also left behind on the Moon to be used as part of a seismometer moonwalker, which transmitted lunar information back to Earth from the Sea of Tranquility.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the quartz watch in 1969 was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology. In place of a balance wheel which oscillated at 5 beats per second, it used a quartz crystal resonator which vibrated at 8,192 Hz, driven by a battery-powered oscillator circuit. In place of a wheel train to add up the beats into seconds, minutes, and hours, it used digital counters. The higher Q factor of the resonator, along with quartz's low temperature coefficient, resulted in better accuracy than the best mechanical watches, while {{the elimination of all}} moving parts made the watch more shock-resistant and eliminated the need for periodic cleaning. The first digital <b>electronic</b> <b>watch</b> with an LED display was developed in 1970 by Pulsar. In 1974 the Omega Marine Chronometer was introduced, the first wrist watch to hold Marine Chronometer certification, and accurate to 12 seconds per year.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>watches</b> in the 1970s, sales of {{mechanical}} watches from the SSIH Group collapsed massively. In 1980, creditor banks gave Nicolas Hayek the task of restructuring the group. In {{the course of a}} management buy-out, Lemania separated from the SSIH Group in 1981 and changed its name to Nouvelle Lemania. In 1992 the Nouvelle Lemania was bought by Breguet. The Lemania calibers are still used today in watches of numerous well-known brands.|$|R
50|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} or {{potassium hydroxide}} {{are used as}} an electrolyte. Sodium hydroxide cells have nearly constant voltage at low discharge currents, making them ideal for hearing aids, calculators, and <b>electronic</b> <b>watches.</b> Potassium hydroxide cells, in turn, provided constant voltage at higher currents, making them suitable for applications requiring current surges, e.g. photographic cameras with flash, and watches with a backlight. Potassium hydroxide cells also have better performance at lower temperatures. Mercury cells have very long shelf life, up to 10 years.|$|R

40|$|Developing lightweight, flexible, {{foldable}} {{and sustainable}} power sources with simple {{transport and storage}} remains a challenge and an urgent need {{for the advancement of}} next-generation wearable electronics. Here, we report a micro-cable power textile for simultaneously harvesting energy from ambient sunshine and mechanical movement. Solar cells fabricated from lightweight polymer fibres into micro cables are then woven via a shuttle-flying process with fibre-based triboelectric nanogenerators to create a smart fabric. A single layer of such fabric is 320 [*]μm thick and can be integrated into various cloths, curtains, tents and so on. This hybrid power textile, fabricated with a size of 4 [*]cm by 5 [*]cm, was demonstrated to charge a 2 [*]mF commercial capacitor up to 2 [*]V in 1 [*]min under ambient sunlight in the presence of mechanical excitation, such as human motion and wind blowing. The textile could continuously power an <b>electronic</b> <b>watch,</b> directly charge a cell phone and drive water splitting reactions. In light of concerns about global warming and energy crises, searching for renewable energy resources that are not detrimental to the environment {{is one of the most}} urgent challenges to the sustainable development of human civilization 1, 2, 3. Generating electricity from natural forces provides a superior solution to alleviate expanding energy needs on a sustainable basis 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. With the rapid advancement of modern technologies, developing lightweight, flexible, sustainable and stable power sources remains both highly desirable and a challenge 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Solar irradiance and mechanical motion are clean and renewable energy sources 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. Fabric-based materials are most common for humans and fibre-based textiles can effectively accommodate the complex deformations induced by body motion 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. A smart textile that generates electrical power from absorbed solar irradiance and mechanical motion could be an important step towards next-generation wearable electronics. Here, we present a foldable and sustainable power source by fabricating an all-solid hybrid power textile with economically viable materials and scalable fabrication technologies. Based on lightweight and low-cost polymer fibres, the reported hybrid power textile introduces a new module fabrication strategy by weaving it in a staggered way on an industrial weaving machine via a shuttle-flying process. Colourful textile modules with arbitrary size and various weaving patterns are demonstrated. Featuring decent breathability and robustness, the hybrid power textile was demonstrated to harvest energy simultaneously from ambient sunshine and human biomechanical movement in a wearable manner with or without encapsulation. The hybrid power textile is highly deformable in response to human motion. Mixed with colourful wool fibres, the hybrid power textile with a size of 4 [*]cm by 5 [*]cm is capable of stably delivering an output power of 0. 5 [*]mW with a wide range of loading resistances from 10 [*]KΩ to 10 [*]MΩ for a human walking under sunlight of intensity 80 [*]mW[*]cm− 2. More importantly, the power textile can be also adopted for large-area application such as curtains and tents. Under ambient sunlight with movement of a car or wind blowing, the textile delivered sufficient power to charge a 2 [*]mF commercial capacitor up to 2 [*]V in 1 [*]min, continuously drive an <b>electronic</b> <b>watch,</b> directly charge a cell phone, as well as drive the water splitting reactions...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{science is}} {{becoming}} an increasingly important multi-disciplinary area, for not only addressing the worldwide energy crisis, but also realizing desired power sources with advanced features for portable electronic devices and sensor networks. Very recently, based on triboelectric effect and electrostatic induction, a fundamentally new technology, triboelectric nanogenerator, has been demonstrated which shows unique merits. But so far, the main limitation for continuing optimizing their output performance {{is a lack of}} fundamental understanding of their core working mechanism. In this thesis research, we first unveil the fundamental theory and output characteristics of triboelectric nanogenerators. Then, we apply the developed theory to the TENG-based self-powered system design. We have developed the first genuine self-powered system to meet mW requirement of personal electronics. The system includes a multilayered TENG, a power management circuit with 60 % total efficiency, and a low leakage energy storage device. Our power management circuit provides the total efficiency that is about two magnitudes higher than the traditional direct charging. And the total system performance is 330 times higher than the state-of-art designs. Driven by palm tapping, this power unit can provide a continuous DC electricity of 1. 044 mW on average power in a regulated and managed manner that can be universally applied as a standard power source for continuously driving numerous conventional electronics, such as a thermometer, a heart rate monitor (electrocardiograph/ECG system), a pedometer, a wearable <b>electronic</b> <b>watch,</b> a scientific calculator, and a wireless radio-frequency communication system. Our study demonstrates the first power unit that utilizes widely accessible biomechanical energy source to sustainably drive a broad range of commercial mobile and wearable electronic devices. This self-charging unit is a paradigm shift towards infinite-lifetime energy sources that can never be achieved solely by batteries. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) {{has been}} the {{dominant}} technology in electronic information display for several decades. Without static power consumption, LCD finds its applications in both high-end and low-end applications: <b>electronic</b> <b>watch,</b> information board, computer monitor and video projection system, etc. 2 π-Bistable Twisted Nematic (2 π-BTN) LCD is a promising technology for the electronic paper application as it consumes even less power then the usual LCD. It also has a huge viewing angle compared to the ordinary Super Twisted Nematic (STN) LCD. However, the metastability of the 2 π-BTN LCD is still {{a problem for the}} realization of zero-power consumption display device. Recently, different researches on the π-BTN have been conducted. Comb On Plane (COP) BTN LCD cell structure is one of the candidates that has successfully realized the π-BTN display with true bistability. This is a completely new LCD cell structure with three electrodes, the driving is a combination of two electrical pulses and the response is reasonably fast for real applications. Intrinsic gray scale is also achievable by the different combinations of those driving pulses. In this thesis, both 2 π-BTN LCD and COP BTN LCD are discussed extensively in different aspects. The origin and the theories of the bistability of nematic phase liquid crystal display were investigated. The new cell structures and the fabrication process are introduced. And the optically optimized deign for both kinds of BTN LCD were discussed. Two optimized optical modes, one for each BTN, were selected for the experimental measurements. The optimal driving schemes were proposed for the both BTN devices. They are optimized for the driving speed and also the pulses amplitude. In the COP-BTN, different driving approaches to achieve permanent gray scale display were found. The switching mechanism behind this new LCD cell structure is investigated and discussed...|$|E
