Instead of seeing vision as a cinema reel, these patients have trouble perceiving <b>gross</b> <b>motion.</b> Most {{of what is known}} about this extremely rare condition was learned through the case study of one patient, LM. LM described pouring a cup of tea or coffee difficult [...] "because the fluid appeared to be frozen, like a glacier". She did not know when to stop pouring, because she could not perceive the movement of the fluid rising. LM and other patients have also complained of having trouble following conversations, because lip movements and changing facial expressions were missed. LM stated she felt insecure when more than two people were walking around in a room: [...] "people were suddenly here or there but I have not seen them moving". Movement is inferred by comparing the change in position of an object or person. LM and others have described crossing the street and driving cars to also be of great difficulty. LM started to train her hearing to estimate distance.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the pain}} does not resolve {{in the first}} 1-2 weeks, then the patient may benefit from a steroid and {{anesthetic}} mixture fluoroscopically injected into the joint (this also serves in confirming diagnosis), as well as manipulative or manual therapy. For the most severe and chronic forms of sacroiliac dysfunction, treatment should proceed {{with the support of}} a sacroiliac belt, injection therapy, and finally, surgery. [...] The anti-inflammatory effect of injection therapy is not permanent, and the injections do not offer an opportunity to stabilize an incompetent joint. Surgery is often considered a last resort, but for some patients, it is the only method of effectively stabilizing the loose joint. A fixation of the joint (screws or similar hardware only, without the use of bone grafting) is more common than a spinal fusion, as it is much less invasive, surgically straightforward, and results in a quicker recovery time for the patient. [...] Some experts in the field believe {{that it is important to}} make sure the sacroiliac joint is in an anatomically correct position prior to fixation or fusion, but published research contradicts this belief. The problem of alignment of the pelvis is that this does not accurately indicate the true status of the inside articular structure, the SIJ. After over 2 decades of pre-fusion pelvic alignment, there is no objective measure to indicate the utility. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that well intentioned clinicians blame the SIJ as causative for the patient's pelvic misalignment. Aligning the pelvis provides temporary relief or relief of pain may occur because multiple structures respond to malalignment such as the hip and lumbar spine; provoking a self-fulfilling prophecy of so-called [...] "SIJ instability." [...] Numerous studies have indicated poor to fair intertester reliability with pelvic palpation and the dubious nature of palpation and traditional <b>gross</b> <b>motion</b> testing was brought into question.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Motion {{planning}} {{is one of}} the key capabilities for autonomous humanoid robots. Previous researches have focused on weight balancing, collision detection, and gait generation. Most planners either assume that the environment can be simplified to a 2 D workspace or assume that the path is given. In this paper, we propose a motion planning system capable of generating both global and local motions for a humanoid robot in a layered or two and half dimensional environment. The planner can generate a <b>gross</b> <b>motion</b> that moves the humanoid vertically as well as horizontally to avoid obstacles in the environments. The <b>gross</b> <b>motion</b> is further realized by a local planner that determines the most efficient footsteps and locomotion over uneven terrain. If the local planner fails, the failure is feedback to the global planner to consider other alternative paths. The implemented humanoid planning system is an interactive tool that can compute collision-free motions for a humanoid robot in an on-line manner. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{method for}} {{analysing}} flexible multibody systems {{in which the}} elastic deformations are small is presented. The motion is considered a gross non-linear rigid body motion with small linear vibrations superimposed on it. For periodic <b>gross</b> <b>motion,</b> {{this results in a}} system of rheo-linear differential equations for the deformations with periodic coefficients. The determination of the required equations with a program for flexible multibody systems is discussed which calculates, besides the periodic <b>gross</b> <b>motion,</b> the linearized, or variational, equations of motion. Periodic solu-tions are determined with a harmonic balance method, while transient solutions are obtained by an averaging method. The stability of the periodic solutions is considered. The procedure has a high computational efficiency and leads to more insight into the structure of solutions. The method is applied to a pendulum with an elliptical motion of its support point, a slider-crank mechanism with flexible connecting rod, a rotor system, and a Cardan drive shaft with misalignment. Key words: periodic solutions, non-linear vibrations, rheolinear vibrations, flexible multibody sys-tems, general purpose software...|$|E

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of moving-obstacle avoidance in many mission-critical systems, {{the conditions under which}} it is possible to guarantee avoidance are poorly understood. Even more troubling is the fact that most researchers in the field address a static formulation of the problem, implicitly assuming that a solution to such a problem can be generalized to the dynamic demands of a real-time system. This paper exposes a serious flaw in this assumption. In the process of doing so, it also describes an important, unsolved lower-bound problem that is fundamental to real-time avoidance of moving obstacles. Robot Motion Planning Motion planning has been a fundamental component of robotics research from the time the first mobile robots were constructed in the late 1960 's. [Nilsson 69] describes what may be the earliest such robot, and this description includes a discussion of a graph-search algorithm used to determine the shortest collision-free path from the robot's location to a goal position. In the 30 years since that time, a large body of research has focused upon the problems associated with determining how to direct a mechanical robot from one location to another, subject to constraints imposed by the application environment and the mechanical constraints of the robot itself. Broadly speaking, motion planning problems fall into two categories. <b>Gross</b> <b>motion</b> planning focuses on problems involving distances much greater than the size of the robot. Fine motion planning revolves around the problem of moving an object in a narrow space, where the required accuracy of motion approaches, or even exceeds, the positional accuracy of the robot. This paper is solely concerned with problems and issues implicit in <b>gross</b> <b>motion</b> planning. The terms “motion planning ” and “path planning ” are used interchangeably throughout the paper, to refer to problems associated with planning the gross motions of mobile robots.
