40|$|Background: Young {{athletes have}} more {{nutritional}} needs than other adolescents because {{of physical activity}} and physical development. Optimal athletic performance results {{from a combination of}} factors including training, body composition, and nutrition. Despite the increased interest in nutrition and use of dietary supplements to enhance performance, some athletes might be consuming diets that are less than optimal. In wrestling it is common practice to optimize one’s body composition and body weight prior to a competition season. This often includes a change in dietary intake or habits. Methods: Twenty‑eight wrestlers, between the ages of 17 and 25 years, participated in this study. Dietary intakes of micro and macro nutrients were collected by face‑to‑face interview, structured food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Dietary intake of energy, carbohydrates, fats and proteins and micronutrients was evaluated. Results: Mean intakes of energy, carbohydrates, proteins and fat were higher than recommended dietary allowances (RDA). The mean intakes of all vitamins and minerals were higher than the RDAs in these wrestlers, except for vitamin <b>D,</b> <b>biotin,</b> zinc, iodine, chrome and molybdenum. Conclusions: On the basis of our results, nutritional education should be given to these subjects and their families for promoting healthy eating habits...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This summary {{aimed to}} {{synthesize}} the protocol guidelines of Pernambuco, the Ministry of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which deal {{with health care}} related to Zika virus infection during pregnancy and the preliminary procedures for surveillance on microcephaly cases including nutritional care. With the increase of number of cases on this event since August, 2015, {{it was necessary to}} reorganize the prenatal care which is offered to pregnant women, including the protocols {{in order to reduce the}} chances of a possible contamination of the virus, to detect previously suspected cases as well as perform follow up on confirmed cases. The gaps in the knowledge of this morbidity, it should be noted that the information and recommendations are subject to revision due to possible incorporation of new knowledge and other evidence, as well as the need for adequacy of surveillance actions in new epidemiological scenarios. It is known that cases of nutritional deficiencies are capable of producing malformation of the Central Nervous System, including microcephaly. In the analysis of the protocols, there were no changes as to the nutritional recommendations already established for the low-risk pregnant women. The authors presented a hypothesis and conceptually, as a prevention measurement, the inclusion of prenatal care to prevent and control isolated or multiple deficiencies associated to microcephaly, such as protein, vitamin A, iodine, folate, B 12, vitamin <b>D,</b> <b>biotin,</b> zinc and selenium...|$|E
40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} indicates that marginal biotin deficiency is not rare, contrary to previous assumptions. Accordingly, robust indicators of biotin status would be useful. In a study of 10 healthy adults, we recently provided evidence that abnormally increased plasma concentration of 3 -hydroxyisovaleryl carnitine (3 HIA-carnitine) is a sensitive indicator of marginal biotin deficiency. We sought to determine whether urinary excretion of 3 HIA-carnitine (expressed as the ratio to urinary creatinine) significantly increases in marginal biotin deficiency. Marginal, asymptomatic biotin deficiency was induced experimentally in the same 10 healthy adults (8 women) by feeding undenatured egg white with meals for 28 <b>d.</b> <b>Biotin</b> status was repleted by a mixed general diet plus biotin supplementation. Urinary excretion of 3 HIA-carnitine was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem MS on d 0, 14, and 28 (depletion) and on d 35 and 50 (repletion). Mean urinary 3 HIA-carnitine concentration increased with depletion (P < 0. 0001; d 0 vs. 28) and decreased with repletion (P = 0. 0002; d 28 vs. 50). Urinary 3 HIA-carnitine excretion was greater than the upper limit of normal in 9 of 10 participants by d 14 and decreased to within normal limits by d 50 in all participants. This study provides evidence that urinary excretion of 3 HIA-carnitine is an early and sensitive indicator of marginal biotin deficiency. The ease of collection of untimed urine samples and application of a new analytical method with simplified sample preparation suggest that urinary 3 HIA-carnitine {{is likely to be}} a useful indicator for large population studies...|$|E
40|$|Metabolism of {{propionate}} {{in human}} subjects was studied using bolus administration of l- 13 C-propionate i. v. or orally. The study population consisted of five patients with propionic acidemia (PA), eight with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA; four responsive to vitamin B 12), one each with multiple carboxylase deficiency and transcobalamin-II deficiency, and five healthy volunteers. Concentrations of l- 13 C-propionate were measured in blood in three patients with PA, two with MMA, and two controls. Breath samples were obtained at intervals during 3 h after the dose, isotopic enrichment of 13 C 0 2 was measured, and the cumulative percentage of recovery of 13 C was {{calculated from the}} individual’s predicted resting energy expenditure. Recovery of 13 C 0 2 and half-time of l- 13 C-propionate in PA were significantly less than normal. The same parameters in MMA were below normal, but significantly greater than in PA. Recovery of 13 C 0 2 was well correlated with clinical severity in PA, but did not correlate in MMA. Differences between MMA and PA may indicate different distribution of propionate pools, differences in inducibility of residual enzyme activities, or an alternate pathway for decarboxylation of propionate available in MMA but not PA. Only one patient with PA demonstrated increased 13 C 0 2 production during biotin treatment. In a B 12 -responsive MMA patient, no differences were noted within 2 d of initiating treatment with B 12, {{but there was an}} increase in 13 C 0 2 production after 4 mo. Recovery of 13 C 0 2 was normal in the patient with transcobalamin-II deficiency before and after treatment with vitamin B 12. In the patient with multiple carboxylase deficiency, 13 C 0 2 generation was nearly normal while he was receiving his maintenance dose of biotin, and was not significantly changed after 3 and 7 <b>d</b> without <b>biotin</b> treatment, despite a decrease of 30 % in lymphocyte propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity. © 1991 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} dietary patterns among a representative sample of German adolescents and their associations with energy and nutrient intake, socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics, and overweight status. Methods In the analysis, data from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents were used. The survey included a comprehensive dietary history interview conducted among 1272 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Dietary patterns were determined with principal component analysis (PCA) based on 48 food groups, for boys and girls separately. Results Three dietary patterns among boys and two among girls were identified. Among boys, high adherence to the 'western' pattern was associated with higher age, lower socioeconomic status (SES), and lower physical activity level (PA). High adherence to the 'healthy' pattern among boys, but not among girls, was associated with higher SES, and higher PA. Among boys, high adherence to the 'traditional' pattern was associated with higher age. Among girls, high adherence to the 'traditional and western' pattern was associated with lower age, lower SES and more hours watching TV per day. The nutrient density of several vitamins and minerals, particularly of B-vitamins and calcium, increased with increasing scores of the 'healthy' pattern among both sexes. Conversely, with increasing scores of the 'western' pattern among boys, most nutrient densities decreased, particularly of fibre, beta-carotene, vitamin <b>D,</b> <b>biotin</b> and calcium. Among girls with higher scores of the 'traditional and western' pattern, nutrient densities of vitamin A, C, E, K and folate decreased. Among boys, high adherence to the 'traditional' pattern was correlated with higher densities of vitamin B 12 and vitamin D and lower densities of fibre, magnesium and iron. No significant associations between dietary patterns and overweight were found. Conclusions Higher scores for dietary patterns characterized by higher consumption of take away food, meat, confectionary and soft drinks ('western' and 'traditional and western') were found particularly among 16 - to 17 -years old boys and among adolescents with lower SES. These patterns were also associated with higher energy density, higher percent of energy from unsaturated fatty acids and lower percent of energy from carbohydrates as well as lower nutrient densities of several vitamins and minerals. Therefore, nutritional interventions should try to focus more on adolescents with lower SES and boys in general. </p...|$|E
