40|$|The present {{invention}} is {{a system}} and method for reducing the voltage necessary to produce a glow discharge in a gas. This is done by fabricating the cathode in a gas <b>discharge</b> <b>device</b> out of a conductive material that is permeable to the subject gas rather than out of a solid material, as in the prior art. Fabricating the cathode with a permeable material rather than a solid material increases the surface area of the cathode and provides the gas with greater access to the cathode's surface. Increasing the surface area of the cathode increases the total discharge current which can be extracted from the cathode without increasing the extraction voltage. This allows the gas <b>discharge</b> <b>device</b> to be operated at a lower voltage than is possible using a cathode fabricated of a solid material. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The etching rate of MO {{samples in}} a planar glow {{discharge}} configuration using Ar as discharge gas is measured {{as a function}} of applied power density ((HO W/cm*) and pressure inside the discharge cell (365 - 750 mTorr). These etching rates are compared with calculated values obtained by modeling of a one dimensional planar glow discharge. The structure of the cathode fall region is modeled in terms of a set of one-dimensional Boltzmann equations describing the three main particle types, ions, neutrals and electrons. Numerical solution of these equations provide the etching rate of the target and the energy distributions of the components. Satisfactory correlation between the measured and calculated etching rates allowed it to conclude also that other quantities for understanding plasma processes like the diffusion profiles of sputtered neutrals can reliably be predicted.
