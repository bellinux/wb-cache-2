5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, it became {{apparent}} that the facilities at Hampden were in need of renewal. As an amateur club, Queen's Park could not possibly fund the works, while Glasgow District Council withdrew funding and the UK Government decided not to <b>fund</b> <b>it</b> either. Queen's Park considered selling Hampden, but a public appeal and minor repair work kept Hampden open during the 1980s. The riot after the 1980 Scottish Cup Final prompted reforms, as alcohol was banned from football stadia in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Valley Parade, {{also known}} as the Northern Commercials Stadium through {{sponsorship}} rights, is an all-seater football stadium in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. It was built in 1886, and was the home of Manningham Rugby Football Club until 1903, when they changed code from rugby football to association football and became Bradford City. It has been Bradford City's home since, although it is now owned by former chairman Gordon Gibb's pension <b>fund.</b> <b>It</b> has also been home to Bradford (Park Avenue) for one season, and Bradford Bulls rugby league side for two seasons, as well as host to a number of England youth team fixtures.|$|E

5|$|Before 1897, {{there had}} been a ferry at Grovehill, and a {{shipyard}} on the east bank, owned by Joseph Scarr. To assist his workers to reach the shipyard, Scarr designed and built a ferry bridge, which cost him £300. It consisted of a large rectangular pontoon, above which was fitted a bridge deck with handrails. Two jack screws enabled the deck to be raised or lowered in relation to the pontoon, so that it remained at approximately the same height, whatever the state of the tide. On the eastern bank, Scarr constructed a variable-height landing, but the landing on the west bank was constructed by Beverley Council, and was fixed. Scarr campaigned to have a variable landing here as well, and was prepared to <b>fund</b> <b>it,</b> but his requests were always rejected. The fixed landing made access to the bridge difficult at high tides. When a boat needed to pass, the west end was freed, and the pontoon swung round to lie parallel to the bank, either upstream or downstream, depending {{on the state of the}} tide. It would then be winched back into position by a small barrel winch. At night the bridge was closed and moored beside the bank.|$|E
5|$|Noé {{first tried}} to get the film funded in the early 2000s. Several {{producers}} responded positively to the script, and it was briefly under development for Tom Tykwer's German company X-Filme Creative Pool. It was considered too expensive and the producers dropped out. Prospects changed when Irréversible (2002) became a commercial success. Noé had written and directed Irréversible for StudioCanal, and it was sold internationally by their subsidiary, Wild Bunch. When the producers at Wild Bunch asked Noé {{what he wanted to do}} next, he answered Enter the Void. The project was once again considered too expensive in relation to its commercial potential, but when Wild Bunch discovered that Noé had started to develop the film for Pathé instead of them, they said that they were willing to <b>fund</b> <b>it.</b> Since development went slowly at Pathé, Noé chose to not renew his contract with the studio and accepted Wild Bunch's offer.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, 2008, {{a seven-year-old}} boy accidentally started {{a fire in}} a nearby {{campground}} while playing with matches. The fire moved up the riverbank and destroyed the bridge's wooden deck and rails. The county funded a study to determine the feasibility and cost of reconstructing the bridge. The engineers determined that the steel cables and towers most likely did not suffer structural damage and could be reused. The study estimated reconstruction costs at $850,000. The engineers determined the original blueprints, preserved in a museum, were of sufficient quality that only minimal engineering work would be required. The county agreed to direct the effort, but will not <b>fund</b> <b>it</b> with taxpayer money. As replicas do not qualify for historical status, historians are debating if using the original towers and cable is enough for the structure to qualify as historical. Grand County has set up an account for interested parties to donate to the reconstruction effort.|$|E
