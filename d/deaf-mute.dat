Indeed, Truffaut stated that without Massigny there would be no film because it would be too static, and that The Green Room is a tale in which Massigny is the anti-hero. Gruault finished a new version of the script by February 1977. Truffaut worked on it with his assistant Suzanne Schiffman and completed the final draft in May 1977.|$|E

25|$|Frenchman Charles-Michel de l'Épée {{published}} his manual alphabet in the 18th century, which has survived basically unchanged in France and North America until the present time. In 1755, Abbé de l'Épée founded the first school for deaf children in Paris; Laurent Clerc was arguably its most famous graduate. Clerc {{went to the}} United States with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet to found the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817. Gallaudet's son, Edward Miner Gallaudet, founded a school for the deaf in 1857 in Washington, D.C., which in 1864 became the National <b>Deaf-Mute</b> College. Now called Gallaudet University, {{it is still the}} only liberal arts university for deaf people in the world.|$|E

The girl meets them and finds herself attracted to the young Arab and the older man's son, who is also bisexual like his father. She is soon torn between the two in a romantic and sexual dilemma that mirrors France's political turmoil regarding the nation's growing Arab population.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{while the}} Special Education is being {{shifted to the}} Special Needs Education, schools for <b>deaf-mutes</b> are {{required}} to review the way they deal with hearing impaired students.

This study clarifies the current situation and necessity of making conversation by writing as a means of communication by conducting a paper-based survey on hearing impaired students regarding making conversation by writing. Additionally, this study is to develop a unique program at schools for <b>deaf-mutes</b> focusing on making conversation by writing as one of most frequently used means of communication for hearing impaired students after their graduation...|$|R

25|$|By {{winter the}} roof was in place, clad in {{reflective}} aluminum {{to make it look}} more like ice blocks. Larocque set himself to the church's decorative touches. To create the appearance of stained glass in the windows, an old French technique was used. The pattern was drawn and painted on translucent paper, then sandwiched between glass. Larocque created the alcove behind the altar and its crucifix himself. Adam commissioned Mona Sharer, a 17-year-old <b>deaf-mute</b> Inuit woman who had shown talent as an artist at a Catholic school in Aklavik, to paint the Stations of the Cross on the inside walls. She started in January 1960 and completed the work in two months, along with some other paintings of scenes from the life of Christ. Later that year the church was formally consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary by Paul Piché, bishop of the Apostolic Vicariate of Mackenzie (later elevated to the Diocese of Mackenzie-Fort Smith).|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} town, the two swindlers then {{impersonate}} brothers of Peter Wilks, a recently deceased man of property. To match accounts of Wilks's brothers, the king attempts an English accent and the duke {{pretends to be}} a <b>deaf-mute</b> while starting to collect Wilks's inheritance. Huck decides that Wilks's three orphaned nieces, who treat Huck with kindness, do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance. In a desperate moment, Huck is forced to hide the money in Wilks's coffin, which is abruptly buried the next morning. The arrival of two new men {{who seem to be}} the real brothers throws everything into confusion, so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers, but, with everyone else distracted, Huck leaves for the raft, hoping to never see the duke and king again. Suddenly, though, the two villains return, much to Huck's despair. When Huck is finally able to get away a second time, he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold Jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward. Defying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actions—"All right, then, I'll go to hell!"—Huck resolves to free Jim once and for all.|$|E
25|$|In {{the months}} leading up to August 1918, US customs {{officials}} at Nogales killed at least two individuals who were attempting to enter the US along the vaguely defined border. On the afternoon of 31 December 1917 Francisco Mercado, an off-duty Mexican customs agent, attempted to cross into Nogales, Arizona, despite calls from a US Army sentry who asked him, in English, to stop. Before various eyewitnesses, the soldier shot and killed Mercado. The killing of Gerardo Pesqueira, the <b>deaf-mute</b> son of former Sonoran governor Ignacio Pesqueira , further angered the people of Nogales, Sonora. US sentries ordered the unarmed man to halt as he approached the border. Unable to hear the order, Pesqueira continued walking, whereupon the guards opened fire, killing him. Pesqueira “was known for his caring and cheerful nature. Historian Parra, citing US General DeRosey Cabell's August 1918 military investigation on the incident, highlights that this--along with the crude attitude shown by US customs agents towards ordinary Mexican border crossers during day-to-day transiting of the border--created a profound sense of resentment of US guards by Mexican border agents. The seeming impunity of US border guards was becoming increasingly intolerable to nogalenses, a point made by General Cabell and U.S. Consul in Nogales, Sonora, E.M. Lawton and Vice-consul W.A. Maguire. However, in a brief passage from his 1921 book History of the Tenth Cavalry, 1866-1921 Edward Glass indicates that changes in Mexican officials and soldier attitudes helped contribute to the tense situation.|$|E

500|$|Among {{his other}} reforms, Covell {{undertook}} {{to modernize the}} facilities of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind by urging the state to install gas lighting and to install plumbing {{for the purposes of}} providing tap water. In addition to the school's infrastructure, Covell overhauled the school's levels of comprehension in 1875 by introducing a classification system in which students were arranged in grades. Covell also introduced the tradition of publishing biennial reports, then annual reports, which have continued to be released every year since 1876. In 1877, at Covell's recommendation, the schools' board established the Department of Visible Speech in which <b>deaf-mute</b> students were instructed in the manner of articulation and lip reading.|$|E

500|$|It had {{not been}} thought {{necessary}} to inscribe the word [...] "cents" [...] on the nickel; the silver and copper-nickel three-cent pieces had circulated for years with only a Roman numeral to indicate the denomination.

[...] They soon did so, and had success in passing the coin. Some coins were given a reeded edge by the fraudsters, to make them appear more like the gold coins. [...] A widespread tale {{is that one of the}} perpetrators of this fraud was a man named Josh Tatum, who would go into a store, select an item costing five cents or less, and offer the gold-plated piece in payment—and many clerks gave him $4.95 in change. [...] According to the tale, the law had no recourse against Tatum, as he had tendered the value of his purchase and had merely accepted the change as a gift. By some accounts, Tatum could not have misrepresented the value of the coin as he was a <b>deaf-mute.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{pioneer in}} the art of making <b>deaf-mutes</b> speak : Jacob Rodrigue Péreire. Jacob R. Péreire (1715 - 80) was an eminent member of the Portuguese Jewish {{community}} in Paris. In addition to his activities in support of the Jews {{on the eve of the}} Emancipation, he was a distinguished scholar. He played a crucial part in the rehabilitation of <b>deaf-mutes,</b> an unknown art : <b>deaf-mutes</b> were thought to be possessed by the devil. Using methods that were both scientific and intuitive, Péreire accomplishes what at the time were considered true miracles. His pupils are presented along with him to Louis XV and at Cour and he arranges for their progress to be confirmed by the Académie des Sciences in Paris. Taking care of the handicapped was at that time the preserve of the clergy : it was quite exceptional for a Jew to be concerned with <b>deaf-mutes.</b> Péreire, at the end of his life, discovers a rival : the Abbé de l'Epée, who, as a priest, is supported by Louis XVI. He eclipses his predecessor and a «conspiracy of silence » is built up around the name of Péreire. Neher-Bernheim Renée.
