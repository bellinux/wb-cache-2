40|$|Diesel {{engines are}} {{the primary source of}} power for the heavy duty vehicles. The {{advantages}} of diesel engines are high fuel efficiency, reliability and durability. The performance and emission characteristics of diesel engine depend on many parameters. One of the important factors which influence the performance and emission of diesel engine is fuel injection pressure. An experimental study was performed on a light duty direct injection diesel engine at 150 bar, 200 bar and 250 bar injection pressure to study its effect on performance and emission. The injection pressure was changed by adjusting the fuel <b>injector</b> <b>spring</b> tension. The performance and emission characteristics were presented graphically and concluded that they were found better at the fuel injection pressure 200 bar for the light duty engine...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for fossil fuels and environmental threat, a number of {{renewable sources of energy}} have been studied worldwide. An attempt is made to assess the suitability of vegetable oil for diesel engine operation, without any modifications in its existing construction. One of the important factors which influence the performance and emission of diesel engine is fuel injection pressure. In the present investigation a vegetable oil, Sea lemon oil has been investigated in a constant speed, DI diesel engine with varied fuel injection pressures (170, 190, 210 and 230 bar). The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of injection pressures on performance and emissions characteristics of the engine. The injection pressure was changed by adjusting the fuel <b>injector</b> <b>spring</b> tension. The performance and emission characteristics were presented graphically and concluded that increase in injector opening pressure increases the brake thermal efficiency and reduces unburned hydrocarbon and smoke emissions significantly...|$|E
40|$|A {{developmental}} Main Oxidizer Valve (MOV) {{was designed}} by NASA-MSFC using additive manufacturing processes. The MOV is a pneumatically actuated poppet valve to control the flow of liquid oxygen to an engine's <b>injector.</b> A compression <b>spring</b> is used to return the valve to the closed state when pneumatic pressure {{is removed from the}} valve. The valve internal parts are cylindrical in shape, which lends itself to traditional lathe and milling operations. However, the valve body represents a complicated shape and contains the majority of the mass of the valve. Additive manufacturing techniques were used to produce a part that optimized mass and allowed for design features not practical with traditional machining processes...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Diesel engine emits more {{pollutants}} to atmosphere causing air pollution. This necessitates {{the search}} of a renewable alternate fuel which is environment friendly. The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the environmental aspects of pongamia bio-fuel in a single cylinder diesel engine with the influence of fuel injection pressure. Approach: Bio-fuel was prepared from non-edible Pongamia pinnata oil by transesterification and used as a fuel in C. I engine. The effect of fuel injection pressure on the engine emission characteristics of a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine has been experimentally investigated using pongamia pinnata methyl ester and its blends with diesel fuel from 0 - 30 % with an increment of 5 % at full load. The tests were conducted at five different injection pressures (190, 200, 210, 220 and 230 KN m - 2) by means of adjusting <b>injector</b> <b>spring</b> tension. Results: Compared to diesel, blend B 5 exhibits lower engine emissions of unburnt hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon di oxide at full load. The High injection pressure of 220 KN m - 2 shows lesser emissions of unburnt hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide while oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide are found to be slightly higher than diesel and blends at full load. Conclusion: From the test results, it was found that a high injection pressure of 220 KN m - 2 causes better atomization with improved engine emission characteristics for diesel and blends at full load. Moreover blend B 5 showed best results at 220 KN m - 2 injection pressure...|$|E
