Perhaps, some failures are justified. • Prophet's Fear encourages pessimistic <b>forecasts</b> because these <b>forecasts</b> cause hidden opportunity losses while optimistic <b>forecasts</b> cause observable actual losses. • Tested <b>forecasts</b> may appear completely unbiased despite a pessimistic pre-launch bias. • Although no perfect solution exists, clients may lessen bias with experimentation and by seeking more accurate <b>forecasts.</b> Forecasters may lessen bias with <b>forecasts</b> conditioned on launching and by seeking more accurate <b>forecasts.</b> <b>forecasting,</b> new product research, channel relationships, bias, brand management...|$|R

5|$|As Kujira {{began to}} track towards Taiwan, the Taiwanese {{government}} issued land- and sea-based warnings {{in advance of}} the storm. The local weather bureau specifically alerted vessels off the southern and southeastern coasts of the island. Continued strengthening of Kujira prompted the Central Weather Bureau to issue medium typhoon warnings for several portions of Taiwan, though these warnings were downgraded to light typhoon status following the subsequent weakening of the typhoon on April22. This made Kujira the first April typhoon to prompt the issuance of any cyclone-related warnings in Taiwan since 1978. Impacts on the island were expected to be limited to rainfall, though the <b>forecasted</b> precipitation was also expected to lessen ongoing drought conditions. However, mudslides were also a potential impact from the typhoon.

This is carried out through the assessment of four a priori hypotheses 1) High Income Country <b>Forecasts</b> are consistently more accurate than those <b>forecasts</b> made for countries in the Low Income Category. 2) The accuracy of <b>forecasts</b> decreases the more distant the <b>forecast</b> horizon becomes, therefore Current-Year (t) <b>Forecasts</b> will outperform One-Year-Ahead (t+ 1) <b>Forecasts.</b> 3) The EIU <b>Forecasts</b> outperform No-Change-Forecasts as measured by the Theil's U-Statistic. 4) The EIU can <b>forecast</b> turning points better than a Random Probability method of <b>forecasting</b> can. The Tests used to evaluate the above hypotheses are the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Theil U-Statistic and Turning Point Directional Analysis.
