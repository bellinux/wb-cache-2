5|$|Several details {{contribute}} {{to the fact that}} there are only a few technical uses for hafnium: First, the close similarity between hafnium and zirconium makes it possible to use zirconium for most of the applications; second, hafnium was first available as pure metal after the use in the nuclear industry for <b>hafnium-free</b> <b>zirconium</b> in the late 1950s.

However, because of hafnium's neutron-absorbing properties, hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it to be far less useful for nuclear-reactor applications. Thus, a nearly complete separation of zirconium and hafnium is necessary for their use in nuclear power. The production of <b>hafnium-free</b> <b>zirconium</b> is the main source for hafnium.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hafnium-free</b> <b>zirconium</b> carbide and {{niobium carbide}} {{can be used}} as {{refractory}} coatings in nuclear reactors. Because of a low neutron absorption cross-section and weak damage sensitivity under irradiation, it finds use as the coating of uranium dioxide and thorium dioxide particles of nuclear fuel. The coating is usually deposited by thermal chemical vapor deposition in a fluidized bed reactor. It also has high emissivity and high current capacity at elevated temperatures rendering it as a promising material for use in thermo-photovoltaic radiators and field emitter tips and arrays.|$|E
40|$|An {{economic}} evaluation {{has been made}} of the silica gel adsorption process for the separation of hafnium and zirconium. It is estimated that <b>hafnium-free</b> <b>zirconium</b> can be prepared at a cost of $ 7. 10 per pound in the form of ZrOCl- 2 Â· 8 H- 2 O. This salt is satisfactory for the preparation of ZrF- 4 by the Ames wet process...|$|E
40|$|Zirconium {{has been}} used as a {{structural}} material in nuclear reactors because of its corrosion resistance, high-temperature strength, and low neutron absorption. Before zirconium can be utilized, however, the hafnium invariably accompanying it must be removed, since hafnium has a prohibitively high neutron absorption cross-section;A process was developed for the production of <b>hafnium-free</b> <b>zirconium</b> by extraction of a zirconium nitrate solution with tributyl phosphate solvent. The hafnium content was reduced from about 2. 5 per cent to less than 100 parts per million. Particular emphasis was placed upon the following portions of the process: (a) selection of the most economical method of preparing zirconium nitrate feed, (b) demonstration of the use of a production type extraction unit, (c) removal of <b>hafnium-free</b> <b>zirconium</b> from the solvent and regeneration of the solvent, (d) recovery of nitric acid leaving the extraction apparatus, and (e) conversion of the solution of purified zirconium to compounds suitable for metal production.

40|$|The {{three main}} {{industrial}} processes {{for the production}} of <b>hafnium-free</b> <b>zirconium</b> are described in terms of their head-end, zirconium-hafnium separation and zirconium metal forming steps. Possible improvements and alternative processes are outlined. Zirconium-hafnium separation schemes based on selective reduction of the chlorides or distillation and sublimation techniques show the most promise for future development in competition with the established hexone-thiocyanate and TBP-nitric acid solvent extraction schemes. Head-end steps involving direct chlorination of zircon in fluidised beds or caustic fusion and metal production via electrowinning warrant further development...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{conducted}} bench-scale investigations {{leading to the}} design of an integrated process for producing reactor-grade zir-conium oxide (Zr 02) from zircon sand, which avoids the air pollution, water pollution, fire hazard, and odor problems associated with the hexone-thiocyanate process. The integrated process consists of three steps: production of crude zirconyl sulfate solution, solvent extraction, and production of Zr 02 from strip liquor. This report describes the solvent extraction step. Multistage, countercurrent liquid-liquid extraction with a tertiary amine in kerosine was used to separate zirconium from a dilute H 2 S 04 solution containing hafnium and other impurities. Process steps de-scribed include extraction from an aqueous feed solution to form a hafnium-contaminated, zirconium-bearing organic-phase solution, scrubbing to separate zirconium from coextracted hafnium, stripping to transfer <b>hafnium-free</b> <b>zirconium</b> into an aqueous strip liquor, chloride-loading to produce a chloride-bearing organic solution, scrubbing with the chloride-loaded organic solution to remove traces of uranium impur-ity from the zirconium-bearing strip liquor, and regeneration to pre-pare the organic solution for reuse. These steps were performed simul-taneously in steady-state, bench-scale experiments. Zirconium recovery of up to 93 pct was achieved. Results of an economic evaluation are included...|$|E
