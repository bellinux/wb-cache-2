40|$|Artificial Intelligence methods like expert systems, {{fuzzy logic}} and neural {{networks}} {{have proved to}} be excellent tools for the control of mineral processes. This technology is currently being embedded directly into process equipment like flotation cells and <b>dewatering</b> <b>filters.</b> This paper presents the modelling module for a pressure filter. The modelling module of the intelligent system predicts filtration using the two-stage hybrid model. The first stage model is based on a numerical model for compressive cake filtration and the second stage model is the identified grey-box model based on the classical filtration model. The filtration parameters for the compressive cake filtration model were obtained from laboratory tests. The parameters for the classical filtration model are defined during filtration using the recursive least square identification method. The two-stage hybrid model of the on-line support system was tested in a full-size filter at a pilot plant. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The <b>dewatering</b> of <b>filter</b> cake in a {{redundant}} Broadbent batch centrifuge was investigated. With {{some minor}} modifications, the machine reduced {{the mass of}} the incoming cake feed by about 30 percent. At the same time approximately half the pol in the filter cake feed was recovered in the centrate return. The potential gains which could be realised from the mass reduction and pol recovery provide a considerable economic incentive for further consideration of <b>filter</b> cake <b>dewatering</b> on a full scale. Introduction-During the past decade the application of centrifuges, particularly of the solid bowl decanter type, to the problem of sludge dewatering has become increasingly widespread 1.

40|$|Broad Funding Opportunity Announcement Project: Led by CEO Ross Youngs, AVS has {{patented}} {{a cost-effective}} dewatering technology that separates micro-solids (algae) from water. Separating micro-solids from water traditionally requires a centrifuge, which uses significant energy to spin the water mass and force materials of different densities {{to separate from}} one another. In a comparative analysis, dewatering 1 ton of algae in a centrifuge costs around $ 3, 400. AVS’s Solid-Liquid Separation (SLS) system is less energy-intensive and less expensive, costing $ 1. 92 to process 1 ton of algae. The SLS technology uses capillary <b>dewatering</b> with <b>filter</b> media to gently facilitate water separation, leaving behind dewatered algae which can then {{be used as a}} source for biofuels and bio-products. The biomimicry of the SLS technology emulates the way plants absorb and spread water to their capillaries...|$|R

40|$|The {{two most}} {{dominant}} technologies in sludge <b>dewatering</b> are belt <b>filter</b> presses and centrifuges. The {{objective of this}} work is to evaluate the two technologies in parallel operation, using full scale data from two wastewater treatment plants of different size.

Based on a cost analysis performed, the annual sludge dewatering and disposal cost for a small to medium size and a medium to large size WWTP was higher for the belt filter press and ranged from 106 - 147 €/ton DS versus 82 - 114 €/ton DS for the centrifuge dewatering system. © 2009 DEStech Publications, Inc...|$|R
50|$|A vacuum {{ceramic filter}} is {{designed}} to separate liquids from solids for dewatering purposes. The device consists of a rotator, slurry tank, ceramic filter plate, distributor, discharge scraper, cleaning device, frame, agitating device, pipe system, vacuum system, automatic acid dosing system, automatic lubricating system, valve and discharge chute. The operation and construction principle of vacuum ceramic filter resemble those of a conventional disc filter, but the filter medium {{is replaced by a}} finely porous ceramic disc. The disc material is inert, has a long operational life and is resistant to almost all chemicals. Performance can be optimized by taking into account all those factors which affect the overall efficiency of the separation process. Some of the variables affecting the performance of a vacuum ceramic filter include the solid concentration, speed rotation of the disc, slurry level in the feed basin, temperature of the feed slurry, and the pressure during <b>dewatering</b> stages and <b>filter</b> cake formation.|$|R
40|$|Biological sludge {{contains}} a large quantity {{of water and}} the decrease of its content constitutes {{one of the main}} issues for wastewater treatment plant operation. Laboratory tests to estimate the sludge dewaterability, i. e., its capability of being dehydrated, have been developed in the past, but {{there is no evidence of}} the tests’ direct correlation with the behavior of the real-scale dewatering devices. Different methods (specific resistance to filtration at different pressure, capillary suction time, expression tests, and drying test) have been applied on civil sludge conditioned with ferric chloride/lime or polymer/ferric chloride and results have been compared with operational data obtained from a full scale plant. The results presented in this paper highlight the role of the expression phase in the sludge <b>dewatering</b> using frame <b>filter</b> presses. To predict the sludge behavior and then to optimize the conditioning step, the laboratory procedure used for selecting the chemicals and doses has also to consider the effect of the expression of the cake...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Small {{particles}} {{typical of}} liquid swine manure often clog sand filter beds and fine filters. We evaluated the effec-tiveness of polymer flocculants to improve drainage and filtration performance of sand filter beds {{by increasing the}} particle size of manure. A pilot separation unit was evaluated at the Swine Unit of the NCSU Lake Wheeler Road Laboratory in Ra-leigh, North Carolina, in 40 consecutive cycles during a 20 -month period. The unit consisted of a homogenization tank that mixed the flushed swine manure, an in-line polymer mixer, and two sand filter beds (29. 7 m 2) designed to receive 30. 5 cm (1 ft) depth of the polymer-treated effluent. Flocculation treatment using polyacrylamide (PAM) polymer improved drainage characteristics of the sand filter by preventing clogging and surface sealing. The combination of flocculation and filtration treatment removed 97 % of total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS), 85 % of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), and 83 % of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from the flushed manure. Along with the solids, treatment resulted in capture of 61 % total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and 72 % total phosphorus (TP). Most of the nutrients removed in the solids were organic forms. Drying time to produce removable cakes varied significantly with the loading rate of solids applied to the sand filter bed. A load of < 2 kg TSS m− 2 per drying cycle allowed completion of the drying cycle in about 8 days, which is desirable to reduce potential fly problems. Our results indicate that PAM flocculation enhances performance of <b>dewatering</b> sand <b>filter</b> beds for swine manure applications...|$|R
40|$|The fractal {{structure}} and particle size of flocs are generally {{recognized as the}} two most crucial physical properties having impact on the efficiency of operation of several unit processes in water and wastewater treatment. In this study, an experimental investigation is undertaken {{on the effect of}} aggregate structure in water and wastewater treatment in Hong Kong. The fractal dimension of the resulting aggregate is employed as a measure of the aggregate structure. Small angle light scattering technique is used here. Different amounts of polymers are mixed to bacterial suspensions and the resulting structures are examined. The addition of polymer may foster aggregate formation by neutralization of the bacterial surface charge and enhance inter-particle bridging. The aggregation behavior may affect the efficiency of certain water and wastewater treatment processes such as dewatering and coagulation. The impacts of aggregate structure on two representative processes, namely, ultra-filtration membrane fouling and pressure <b>filter</b> <b>dewatering</b> efficiency, are studied. It is found that the looser flocs yield a more porous cake and less tendency to foul whilst more porous filter cakes yield more ready biosolids dewatering.

40|$|In {{the current}} decade, the {{development}} of renewable products to replace fossil products is an essential and important issue from industrial, environment, and academic point of views. In the current study, {{an attempt was made}} to study the tribological behaviour of waste cooking oil blended with SAE 40, investigate their viscosity and moisture content and also optimized the differemt operating parameter of the tribological performance. Waste cooking palm oil (WCO) was chosen from the most common waste oil using in Malaysia. Waste cooking oil was undergone three types of process, the coarse <b>filtering,</b> <b>dewatering</b> and fine <b>filtering.</b> Moisture content and viscosity analysis were investigated to study the physical properties of blended lubricant as well as the effectiveness of filtration method. Wear and friction performance was evaluated using piston-liner contact tester, and the material use is aluminium 6061 which is the standard material for piston. The design of experiment (DOE) was constructed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) method. Influence of different operating parameter such as rotational speeds (200 RPM, 250 RPM, 300 RPM), volume concentration (SAE 40, 5 % and 10 % of waste oil), and applied loads (2 kg, 5. 5 kg and 9 kg) investigated and obtain the optimization for different lubricant in tribological behavior. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) that equipped with EDX system was used to identify the wear mechanism and element {{on the surface of the}} specimen. According to the coefficient of friction versus time result and the weight loss result, the friction coefficient between the three concentrations of oil shows a considerable difference between SAE 40 and two blended lubricant. Based on the properties result, for viscosity, as the concentration of waste cooking oil increases, the viscosity of the bio-lubricant decreases. According to result in moisture content, the moisture content percentage in 0 % volume concentration of waste cooking oil is the same with moisture content percentage in 10 % volume concentration of waste cooking oil while 5 % shows the lowest percentage of the moisture content. Based on SEM result, the wear on the surface specimen decrease as the concentration of waste cooking oil added with engine oil reduce, and it was due to the SAE 40 showed the highest viscosity result compared to 10 % concentration because higher viscosity tends to drag the movements between two contact surfaces. It can be said that using a small amount of WCO in the engine oil was not give much impact in the engine component regarding on their coefficient of friction and wear mechanism. From the lubricant properties analysis, it shows that the properties of the blended lubricant approached with the lubricant baseline (SAE 40) ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{improvement}} is applied at the regeneration stage when the residual filter cake is removed by back-flushing the clean plant water {{to wash the}} internal ceramic <b>filter.</b> <b>Filter</b> cake <b>dewatering</b> of ceramic <b>filters</b> produces low final cake moistures at minimum operation and maintenance costs. The residuals moisture are removed from the filter cake due to capillary action within the ceramic elements, which rotate above the slurry level. This process gives maximum filtration, and the final cake can be maintained at the lowest moisture content due to the effective cleaning of both ceramic sectors. In addition, performance can be optimized by using an ultrasonic cleaning system to achieve efficient operation conditions for regeneration of plates. The use of filtrate in looped water cycle in the design operation can reduce the water consumption up to 30-50%. High filtrate purity can be obtained, as there is only 0.001-0.005 g/l solids in the filtrate produced from this process. This eventually results in the reduction of polymer flocculant consumption in thickeners.Ceramic scraper knives have been introduced to this design as {{they are able to}} shave through the mass formed in <b>filter</b> cake <b>dewatering.</b> The remaining layer of solid residue on the filter provides protection from mechanical abrasion. Therefore, the maintenance costs can be reduced while the service life of the ceramic filter increases.|$|R
40|$|In 2002, Japan enacted {{environmental}} standards for dioxins contaminated sediment. A nationwide sediment dioxins survey of public waters found sediment exceeding {{environmental standards}} in some rivers: a problem requiring countermeasures. The Eco-tube is a permeable geotextile container with soft and {{high water content}} sediment deposited in rivers, lakes, and marshes. It promotes dewatering of the sediment, and the filtering function of the tubes c§an purify the drain and enclose toxic substances such as dioxins. After dewatering, {{they are used to}} build embankments by taking advantage of their tensile strength. This report describes a trial execution of Eco-tubes that enclose dioxins contaminated sediment. The trial followed preliminary testing: measuring the quantity and turbidity of the drain by pressurized filtering test to examine the geotextile’s filtering performance and select the coagulant. Next, 0. 2 m 3 tubes of the selected material were filled with sediment and used for laboratory experiments based on the actual execution, confirming the <b>dewatering</b> speed and <b>filtering</b> effectiveness of the method. The trial applied 2 patterns (5 cases) based on the test results. (1) Filling high density tubes with sediment already containing coagulant. (2 cases) (2) Filling tubes with sediment and adding coagulant into drain. (3 cases) Results: (1) Drain of 130 pg-TEQ/g dioxins contaminated sediment becomes 2. 4 pg-TEQ/l. (2) Drain including the 960 pg-TEQ/l dioxins went down 0. 42 pg-TEQ/l by adding coagulant. Pattern (2) was much easier to execute, and more effectively reduced turbidity of the water. The tube height fell to 1 / 2 to 1 / 7 of maximum height in about 5 months. These findings confirmed that Eco-tube enclose dioxins contaminated sediment and reduce the volume of sediment by dewatering...|$|R
40|$|Cost-effective {{disposal}} is a {{major concern}} for sediment remediation projects that require removal of sediments. To meet landfill criteria sediments must pass tests for hazardous waste content, hazardous waste leachability and residual moisture content. A knowledge of these parameters is essential before the cost of the remediation can be estimated. CRA has developed a laboratory treatability study procedure to obtain the required information rapidly. An example of the application of this procedure is a treatability study that was conducted on heavy metal contaminated dredged sediment from a site in Michigan Three sediment samples were obtained and composited to form a sample that would be representative of site conditions. To be acceptable for disposal at a non-hazardous waste landfill the sediment samples must pass TCLP, stability criteria, and the paint filter test. Sediment leachate data showed that the sediment met only TCLP criteria, therefore stabilization was necessary. Ten polymers were evaluated for their effect on solids settling. A sediment slurry was settled with and without polymer treatment and the supernatant and settled solids were collected. A filter press was used to dewater the settled solids to produce a filter cake, which was tested for water content, TCLP metals, and the paint filter test. The effects of solidification agents on the settled solids were also evaluated. The agents tested were Portland cement, fly ash, and cement kiln dust. The results showed that untreated settled solids did not meet landfill stability requirements. The ability of polymer treatment, solidification and <b>filter</b> cake from <b>dewatering</b> using a <b>filter</b> press to meet the landfill stability requirements will be described. Based on the results of the treatability study a cost-effective technique for sediment treatment and disposal was determined...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{are done}} on lab scale with sludge from Garmerwolde and Heerenveen. The {{goal was to}} {{determine}} important differences between the sludges and coagulants. Garmerwolde sludge had a darker colour than Heerenveen sludge. It was also seen that Heerenveen sludge contained much more pollutions such as twigs and hairs. The odour of Heerenveen sludge was also much stronger. These differences {{can be explained by}} the fact that Garmerwolde sludge is digested and the organic material is therefore lower. An optimum dry solid content for Garmerwolde was not reached yet but with a dosage of 167. 5 g/kg sludge DSC, a dry solid content of 30 % could be reached. However this dosage is too high to use it in practice. In the case of Heerenveen there was an optimum dry solid content with a dosage of 88. 5 g/kg sludge DSC. With this dosage a dry solid content of 27 % is obtained. An improvement of the dry solid content is not acquired with the use of magnesium salts as coagulant. With both sludges it was seen that manually <b>dewatering</b> using a <b>filter,</b> was difficult. There were more flocs formed with MgCl 2 but still the water was more unclear than using FeCl 3. Probably the settle time needs to be increased if higher dry solid contents should be reached. Both sludges require a suitable dosage of coagulant and flocculant. Wrong amounts of coagulant and flocculant cause too large flocs. When the flocs are too thick, the sludge cake will be thicker as well because dewatering is difficult and the filtration resistance will increase. When the dosage of coagulant and flocculant is too low, it is not possible to obtain a sludge cake at all because of the absence of flocs. ...|$|R
