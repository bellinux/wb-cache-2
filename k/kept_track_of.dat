5|$|From 1974 to 1977, Oceanside police <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> over 1,000 {{accidents}} {{that occurred}} along SR 76. A citizen action {{group known as}} Concerned Citizens for Highway 76 formed soon after. Caltrans began holding hearings again in 1979, proposing the building of an expressway {{as opposed to a}} freeway or to widening Mission Avenue. At one hearing, local officials criticized the delay, while others criticized the routing, the decision to build an expressway instead of a freeway, and building a route through an environmentally sensitive area. In May 1980, the state Assembly Transportation Committee approved a resolution that requested an answer from the governor at the time, Jerry Brown, and Caltrans as to why certain projects, including SR76, had not been started.|$|E
5|$|From {{as early}} as the Preclassic period, the ruler of a Maya polity was {{expected}} to be a distinguished war leader, and was depicted with trophy heads hanging from his belt. In the Classic period, such trophy heads no longer appeared on the king's belt, but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives. Right up {{to the end of the}} Postclassic period, Maya kings led as war captains. Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured, tortured, and sacrificed. The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> troop movements in painted books.|$|E

This class includes railway coolies, servants, rickshaw-pullers, labourers, fishermen, guards and other people who earn their living by doing minor chores.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Hague and Brandle {{started to go}} bad in late 1931, during construction of Jersey City Medical Center, an important project to Hague. Leo Brennan, a contractor approved by Hague without consulting Brandle, who was building a backup power station for the hospital, refused to work with Brandle's card-file system, by which he <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> union members and blacklisted those whom he disliked. The annoyed Brandle called a strike, but Brennan's workers refused; the police shut down the site after a brawl, but Brennan got court approval to continue. To placate Brandle, who threatened a strike that would stop all construction work on the center, Hague paid off Brennan and hired another contractor that Brandle had approved.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player campaign mode, Descent 3 features an online multiplayer mode where numerous players can compete {{against each other in}} eight different game types. Notable game types include Anarchy, where the objective is to kill as many opponents as possible, Capture the Flag, where two to four teams compete against each other to capture opposing flags, and Monsterball, in which players must shoot and guide a ball into their opponents' goal. Aspects such as time limit, number of players, map to play on, and selection of what weapons are allowed, among others, can be customized to match player preference. The game also features an observer mode which allows players to watch a multiplayer game as a spectator and a co-operative mode that allows players to work together to complete campaign missions. Multiplayer games support the DirectPlay, IPX, and TCP/IP protocols. Online gameplay was also possible over Parallax Online, an online gaming service which <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> players' statistics and rankings.|$|E

Kaempffert, however, was more lax in his accounting. No wrongdoing was alleged, but the board wanted greater oversight. To achieve that, the board {{created a new}} layer of management, [...] "assistant directors," [...] who reported not only to Kaempffert but also directly to the Board. It was this usurpation of Kaempffert's authority {{that led him to}} ask, in January 1931, the New York Times if he could have his old job back. The Times agreed. He remained with the Times until his retirement in 1956. He was succeeded as science editor by William L. Laurence.|$|R

5|$|The European Winter of 1941-1942 was {{the coldest}} {{of the twentieth}} century. On 30 November, von Bock {{reported}} to Berlin that the temperature was –45 °C (–49 °F). General Erhard Raus, commander of the 6th Panzer Division, <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> the daily mean temperature in his war diary. It shows a suddenly much colder period during 4–7 December: from –36 to –38 °C (–37 to –38 °F). Other temperature reports varied widely. Zhukov said that November's freezing weather stayed around –7 to –10°C (+19 to +14°F) Official Soviet Meteorological Service records show the lowest December temperature reached –28.8°C (–20°F). These numbers indicated severely cold conditions, and German troops were freezing with no winter clothing, using equipment that was not designed for such low temperatures. More than 130,000 cases of frostbite were reported among German soldiers. Frozen grease {{had to be removed}} from every loaded shell and vehicles had to be heated for hours before use. The same cold weather, typical for the season, hit the Soviet troops, but they were better prepared.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, Hutton volunteered for the army and was recruited to the Army Physical Training Corps as a sergeant-instructor. Although no first-class cricket was played during the war, league and charity cricket matches continued and Hutton played several high-profile matches in 1940. But in March 1941, his future in cricket was threatened by a serious injury. On the last day of a commando training course in York, Hutton fell in the gymnasium when a mat slipped from under him. He suffered a fractured left forearm and dislocated his ulna at the wrist. By the summer, surgery and rest initially looked to have repaired the injury; Hutton returned to his unit and resumed cricket, scoring a century in one game. However, he began to suffer increasing pain and underwent more surgery to graft bone from his legs onto the injured arm. A first operation failed, but the second attempt at the end of 1941 eventually proved successful. The surgery left him with a left arm almost two inches shorter than the right. He was discharged from the army in the summer of 1942 and, after a period of recovery, began work as a civilian for the Royal Engineers, inspecting the condition of government-owned properties. Hutton's recovery and return to cricket was closely followed by the wartime press, which <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> many pre-war cricketers.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Cleveland's {{return to}} office, hard times struck {{the nation with}} the Panic of 1893. A {{businessman}} in Youngstown, Robert Walker, had lent money to McKinley in their younger days; in gratitude, McKinley had often guaranteed Walker's borrowings for his business. The governor had never <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> what he was signing; he believed Walker a sound businessman. In fact, Walker had deceived McKinley, telling him that new notes were actually renewals of matured ones. Walker was ruined by the recession; McKinley was called upon for repayment in February 1893. The total owed was over $100,000 and a despairing McKinley initially proposed to resign as governor and earn the money as an attorney. Instead, McKinley's wealthy supporters, including Hanna and Chicago publisher H. H. Kohlsaat, became trustees of a fund from which the notes would be paid. Both William and Ida McKinley placed their property {{in the hands of}} the fund's trustees (who included Hanna and Kohlsaat), and the supporters raised and contributed a substantial sum of money. All of the couple's property was returned to them by the end of 1893, and when McKinley, who had promised eventual repayment, asked for the list of contributors, it was refused him. Many people who had suffered in the hard times sympathized with McKinley, whose popularity grew. He was easily re-elected in November 1893, receiving the largest percentage of the vote of any Ohio governor since the Civil War.|$|E

60|$|He {{kept repeating}} this {{over and over}} to himself and then he fell to {{laughing}} out loud, the cackling, hideous laughter that had terrified Jane. Presently he realized his knees were bleeding and that they hurt him. He looked cautiously behind. No one was in sight. He listened. He could hear no indications of pursuit and so he rose to his feet and continued upon his way a sorry sight--covered with filth and blood, his beard and hair tangled and matted and filled with burrs and dried mud and unspeakable filth. He <b>kept</b> no <b>track</b> <b>of</b> time. He ate fruits and berries and tubers that he dug from the earth with his fingers. He followed the shore of the lake and the river that he might be near water, and when ja roared or moaned he climbed a tree and hid there, shivering.|$|R

[...] The meeting was attended by approximately 20 of the protestors, about whom Adler said, [...] "It's their constitutional right", so long as they pay to attend and dine at the luncheon for the same fee as the membership".

When Sidney Bechet played for a Chicago competitor to Jazz, Ltd and broke his Jazz, Ltd. contract, Ruth won a $5,000 breach of contract award against him and Sidney never played in Chicago again. In 1929 she got financial backing from banks in New York to produce her own show in Japan, which had never before been done by a chorus girl.|$|R
50|$|No baserunning is {{involved}} in the game—the score is <b>kept</b> by keeping <b>track</b> <b>of</b> imaginary runners tagging the bases of a non-existent diamond. Typically, a grounder past the pitcher is a single; if the pitcher fields it before it gets past position, it is an out. Fly balls past the pitcher—unless caught for outs—are doubles, and balls hit to a pre-designated distance are home runs. Triples are agreed upon prior to games. Tournament half-rubber has only singles and home runs, the latter being achieved by hitting the ball 120 feet, or double the distance between batter and pitcher.|$|R

25|$|The online {{component}} of the game uses the in-game massgate system, which is derived from Ground Control. The system helps players keep track of friends, allowing them {{to see whether they}} are online or playing a game. Clans can be created and <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> in-game, with features such as ranks and clan matches. Massgate includes leader boards and a ranking system based on US Army military ranks. Players can increase their rank and leader board position in a way similar to Battlefield 2, by accumulating earnings and scoring points, medals, and badges. Achieving higher ranks becomes progressively more difficult. The leader board also keeps track of clan rankings.|$|E
25|$|Maya rituals {{differ from}} region to region, but many similar {{patterns}} in ceremonies, whether being performed for {{individual or group}} need, have been noted. First, all rituals are preceded by foresight of a medicine man, who determines {{the day of the}} ceremony through calendrical divination. The medicine men of the Ixil Maya of Guatemala, who <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> days in their heads, would lay out red seeds from the coral tree onto the pre-Columbian calendar to count them and figure out what day best suited the specific ritual. As a symbol of a spiritual purification, the individual or individuals would observe a fasting and abstinence period before the ritual day.|$|E

Additionally, the Old Man was capable of telepathic communication with the hero and could grant the child magical abilities for {{short periods of time}} by researching spells in tomes of forbidden magic. The Old Man's ability to see clairvoyantly also enabled him to sense when certain plot elements were occurring such as the kidnapping of the great fairy or the washing up of useful items by the seashore. These events would be relayed to the hero telepathically.|$|E
5000|$|On Sunday {{afternoon}} November 16, 1952, Hopkins {{was struck}} by a tornado which greatly damaged the downtown business district.

50|$|In 1863, {{during the}} American Civil War (1861-1865), Campbell {{purchased}} his freedom for $233 and hired his wife. Campbell {{and his wife}} worked for government clerks in Nicholasville, Kentucky near Camp Nelson, with half of his wife's earnings going to her slaveholder. Campbell was a very active leader {{in the church and}} organized three other churches at Mt. Pleasant, Otter Creek, Mt. Nebo, New Liberty in Bobtown (in 1866), Kirksville, and Goodloe Chapel. He helped establish the Baptist Church South Elkhorn District and the Mt.

5000|$|Boyd's espionage {{career began}} by chance. According to her 1866 account, on July 4, 1861, {{a band of}} Union army {{soldiers}} heard she had Confederate flags in her room, and they came to investigate. They hung a Union flag outside her home. This made her angry enough, but {{when one of them}} cursed at her mother, she was enraged. Boyd pulled out a pistol and shot and killed the man. A board of inquiry exonerated her, but sentries were posted around the house and officers <b>kept</b> close <b>track</b> <b>of</b> her activities. She profited from this enforced familiarity, charming {{at least one of the}} officers, Captain Daniel Keily, [...] "To him," [...] she wrote later, [...] "I am indebted for some very remarkable effusions, some withered flowers, and a great deal of important information." [...] Boyd conveyed those secrets to Confederate officers via her slave, Eliza Hopewell, who carried the messages in a hollowed-out watch case. On her first attempt at spying, she was caught and told she could be sentenced to death, but was not. She was not scared and realized she needed to find a better way to communicate.|$|R
25|$|When the King traveled, Marshals {{supervised}} the local Voivodes. The Marshals decided {{who would be}} admitted to royal audience.

Each Marshal wielded a marshal's staff, which he had received from the Chancellor (Kanclerz). In exchange, all Chancellor nominations were heralded by the Marshals. If no Marshal was present, his functions were carried out by a Grand Treasurer or secular Grand Chancellor. On formal occasions and during travel, where appropriate, a Marshal with his staff of office preceded the King. Close after the Marshals in the hierarchy were the Chancellors.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for the wall is the degree of control it would have provided over immigration, smuggling and customs. Limites did not strictly mark the boundaries of the empire: Roman power and influence often extended beyond the walls. People within and beyond the limes travelled through it each day when conducting business, and organised check-points like those offered by Hadrian's Wall provided good opportunities for taxation. With watch towers only a short distance from gateways in the limes, patrolling legionaries could have <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> entering and exiting natives and Roman citizens alike, charging customs dues and checking for smuggling. Another theory is of a simpler varietythat Hadrian's Wall was partly constructed to reflect the power of Rome and was used as a political point by Hadrian. Once its construction was finished, it is thought to have been covered in plaster and then whitewashed: its shining surface reflected the sunlight and was visible for miles around.|$|E
25|$|FiveThirtyEight's {{predictions}} for each state primary, {{both for the}} Republican and the Democratic party nominations, were based on statistical analysis, not on the analyst's opinions.

In the 2016 primaries, the projections also took into account endorsements. The website also <b>kept</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> the accumulation of national party convention delegates. In a comparison of prediction success published by Bloomberg News after the primary season was completed, FiveThirtyEight's prediction success tied for {{the highest percentage of}} correct primary poll winners, at 92%; but it lagged behind PredictWise in predicting a larger set of primaries.

50|$|Stewart Pixley {{proved an}} {{aggressive}} rival. He won {{much of the}} 10-ounce 998 gold bar business with India, ordering from Johnson Matthey's new refinery. He also <b>kept</b> close <b>track</b> <b>of</b> silver, whose price fell 50% between 1850 and 1900 as European nations turned from gold and silver. In pursuit of American silver, he took a train to Montana (his great-grandson prized the ticket a hundred years later) and bought {{a stake in the}} Drum Lummon mine. However, Frederick Wilkins (son of the first 1847 partner) had retained the connections with Mexican and South American mines that James Sharp had fostered half a century earlier. Wilkins gave a precise analysis of silver output in Mexico (the foremost producer) to the 1876 House of Commons Select Committee on the Depreciation of Silver. The firm's status as silver broker also secured them the chairmanship of the London Silver Fixing, which was held in their office at 32 Great Winchester Street, from 1897. They were joined by Mocatta & Goldsmid, Pixley & Abell and Samuel Montagu & Co. at 1.45 pm Monday through Friday and 11.45 am on Saturday.|$|R
50|$|The ships {{original}} {{echo sounding}} equipment and Hydrographic Data Acquisition System (HDAS) {{consisted of a}} very early seagoing data processing system made up of two Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-9 computers that shared a central drum disk drive. KSR-35 TTYs were used as the primary system consoles and a Calcomp flatbed plotter <b>kept</b> a real-time <b>track</b> <b>of</b> the ships position. This equipment was all replaced in the mid 1970s by a new narrow beam swath system. The swath array, replacing the single beam system, was the Bottom Topography Survey Subsystem (BOTOSS) and the processing system, replacing HDAS, was the Bathymetric Survey System (BASS). The initial BOTOSS hull mounting was subject to air bubble interference so that a new arrangement on a fairing and foil mounted on the keel was required to house the array elements during a 1974-1975 period in a West Coast yard.|$|R
