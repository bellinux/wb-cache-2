40|$|This {{investigation}} {{compares the}} effectiveness of two methods of teaching production work in beginning typewriting. One method {{is defined as the}} traditional approach, which adheres to suggestions and materials for teaching found in current typewriting textbooks. Students are paced, drilled, and timed on straight copy to build speed and accuracy, but not on production work; they usually type from perfectly arranged copy; and they circle their errors for at least half the course. The other method, developed at North Texas State University by Payne and Anderson, is defined as the teacher-directed approach. Students are intensively paced, drilled, and timed by the teacher on short, simple jobs or parts of jobs; they usually type from unarranged copy; they learn to <b>erase</b> <b>errors</b> on production work during the first production unit; and they are evaluated {{on the basis of the}} number of mailable items produced during a specific time period...|$|R
40|$|To answer {{questions}} related to keying errors and error corrections, performance {{data were collected from}} typists as they keyed text into a simulated word-processing system. Data are presented on the frequency of error detection, {{the amount of time spent}} correcting errors, the number of characters <b>erased</b> per <b>error</b> correction, and the types of errors corrected. Comparisons are also made between corrected and uncorrected errors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Free-viewpoint video {{conferencing}} allows a partic-ipant {{to observe the}} remote 3 D scene from any freely chosen viewpoint. An intermediate virtual viewpoint image is commonly synthesized using two pairs of transmitted texture and depth maps from two neighboring captured viewpoints via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). To maintain high quality of synthesized images, {{it is imperative to}} contain the adverse effects of network packet losses that may arise during texture and depth video transmission. Towards this end, we develop an integrated approach that exploits the representation redundancy inherent in the multiple streamed videos—a voxel in the 3 D scene visible to two captured views is sampled and coded twice in the two views. In particular, at the receiver we first develop an error concealment strategy that adaptively blends corresponding pixels in the two captured views during DIBR, so that pixels from the more reliable transmitted view are weighted more heavily. We then couple it with a sender-side optimization of reference picture selection (RPS) during real-time video coding, so that blocks containing samples of voxels that are visible in both views are more error-resiliently coded in one view only, given adaptive blending will <b>erase</b> <b>errors</b> in the other view. Further, synthesized view distortion sensitivities to texture versus depth errors are analyzed, so that relative importance of texture and depth code blocks can be computed for system-wide RPS optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can outperform the use of a traditional feedback channel by up to 0. 82 dB on average at 8 % packet loss rate, and by as much as 3 dB for particular frames.

5|$|For pharmacology, Shen {{wrote of}} the {{difficulties}} of adequate diagnosis and therapy, {{as well as the}} proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs. He held great concern for detail and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture. In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China. For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly <b>erase</b> writing <b>errors</b> on paper.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{invention}} of Tipp-Ex, it became possible to <b>erase</b> a typographical <b>error</b> typed with a typewriter. The typewriter would be backspaced to the letter that was to be changed, the correction paper would be placed in front of the ribbon, and the mistyped letter would be re-typed. The system only worked if the typewriter repositioned the re-typed letter in exactly the same place as originally typed, which could be problematic if returning to a previous line.|$|R
50|$|If {{the bomber}} was {{to one side}} of the target, or {{drifting}} away from the proper approach, the line control wheel was used to rotate the entire sight to place the crosshair back on the target. Simply flying at that angle will not bring the bomber back along the proper approach, it will cause the bomber to fly parallel to the correct line. In order to re-capture the approach, the bomber has to turn past the correct heading and <b>erase</b> the accumulated <b>error,</b> then turn back onto the proper line.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{expansion}} of urban Glasgow. (Abstract.) — In 1945 {{the problems of}} urban Glasgow had a magnitude unknown in other important towns in Britain; it had inherited very poor housing conditions (51. 6 p. 100 of its dwellings were officially classified as unhealthy; Industrial and residential areas were completely mixed together; there was notorious lack of commercial, cultural and leisure facilities and green spaces were rare. The application of a vast renovating project in the most deprived areas (29 districts, affecting 118 000 dwellings and some 2 500 industrial establishments) necessitated the « expulsion » of 300 000 people. In {{the face of this}} pro-blem of overspill from Glasgow and the fact that building of huge suburban schemes had been stopped, two solutions were envisagea. Firstly : — A large number of agreements with Scottish towns which were anxious to expand. Secondly : — The more original idea of setting up satellite towns. The first results of this scheme were not satisfactory. This study emphasises the diversity of the problem, the conflicting interests and the difflculties encountered in this willing attempt to <b>erase</b> the <b>errors</b> accumulated over a century {{in the development of the}} city.

50|$|Pytlak was the Indians' catcher on October 2, 1938, when Bob Feller set {{a modern}} major league record of 18 strikeouts against the Detroit Tigers. Between September 10, 1938 and September 18, 1940, Pytlak handled 571 {{consecutive}} chances for the Indians without an <b>error,</b> <b>erasing</b> the previous major league mark of 452 set by Gabby Hartnett of the Chicago Cubs. A rivalry between Pytlak and Rollie Hemsley for the Indians starting catcher's role erupted during spring training in 1939, with Pytlak threatening {{to quit the}} team if he wasn't named the team's number one catcher. Pytlak was also resentful of Hemsley when, the latter became known as Bob Feller's personal catcher during the 1938 season. When Pytlak suffered an injury in the 1939 season, Hemsley replaced him as the Indians' starting catcher, and played well enough to keep Pytlak from regaining the number one position. Even so, Indians' pitcher Johnny Allen refused to pitch unless Pytlak was the catcher.|$|R
40|$|We have {{irradiated}} engineering {{samples of}} Freescale 4 M nonvolatile memories with heavy ions. They use Silicon nanocrystals as the storage element, {{rather than the}} more common floating gate. The irradiations were performed using the Texas A&M University cyclotron Single Event Effects Test Facility. The chips were tested in the static mode, and in the dynamic read mode, dynamic write (program) mode, and dynamic erase mode. All the errors observed appeared {{to be due to}} single, isolated bits, even in the program and <b>erase</b> modes. These <b>errors</b> appeared {{to be related to the}} micro-dose mechanism. All the errors corresponded to the loss of electrons from a programmed cell. The underlying physical mechanisms will be discussed in more detail later. There were no errors, which could be attributed to malfunctions of the control circuits. At the highest LET used in the test (85 MeV/mg/sq cm), however, there appeared to be a failure due to gate rupture. Failure analysis is being conducted to confirm this conclusion. There was no unambiguous evidence of latchup under any test conditions. Generally, the results on the nanocrystal technology compare favorably with results on currently available commercial floating gate technology, indicating that the technology is promising for future space applications, both civilian and military...|$|R
5000|$|The {{memory of}} Earth, and its {{location}} {{may be lost}} to the sands of time or shrouded in myth as mankind abandons the Earth. Isaac Asimov's Foundation and Empire series depict a common theme of a destroyed Earth. In other works, such as Battlestar Galactica, it is largely forgotten except by the religious. In the numerous books of the Dumarest saga by E.C. Tubb, the adventurer protagonist was born on a [...] "galactic backwater" [...] Earth and {{at a young age}} had stowed away on a rare spaceship touching down on the planet; having seen more than enough of the galaxy he wants to go back, but no one else had ever heard of the planet. The first Terran inhabitants of the Koprulu Sector are Earth-born criminals in sleeper ships in StarCraft. The expansion also mentions about Earth: upon hearing of the United Earth Directorate's forces' arrival, Zeratul remarks [...] "Raynor [...] spoke to me of the distant Terran homeworld of Earth." [...] This implies that the Terrans still know about Earth but its location is lost (StarCraft manual mentions that the sleeper ships have become lost in hyperspace when an <b>error</b> <b>erased</b> the intended destination's coordinates, {{as well as those of}} Earth's, resulting in the ships going at full speed for several decades until the engines broke down). Also, the Terran Confederacy uses the same flag as the Confederacy in the American Civil War. Also, in the Zodiac series by Romina Russell, it states that [...] "history tells us the original human colonizers came from a distant and long-gone planet called Earth, and they traveled through a portal in Helios to get here—but the portal is just another myth." ...|$|R
