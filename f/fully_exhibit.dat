60|$|There {{is another}} and closely allied {{difficulty}} consequent on {{the doctrine of}} the descent of our domestic dogs from several wild species, namely, that they {{do not seem to be}} perfectly fertile with their supposed parents. But the experiment has not been quite fairly tried; the Hungarian dog, for instance, which in external appearance so closely resembles the European wolf, ought to be crossed with this wolf: and the pariah dogs of India with Indian wolves and jackals; and so in other cases. That the sterility is very slight between certain dogs and wolves and other Canidae is shown by savages taking the trouble to cross them. Buffon got four successive generations from the wolf and dog, and the mongrels were perfectly fertile together. (1/48. M. Broca has shown ('Journal de Physiologie' tome 2 page 353) that Buffon's experiments have been often misrepresented. Broca has collected (pages 390-395) many facts on the fertility of crossed dogs, wolves, and jackals.) But more lately M. Flourens states positively as the result of his numerous experiments that hybrids from the wolf and dog, crossed inter se, become sterile at the third generation, and those from the jackal and dog at the fourth generation. (1/49. 'De la Longevite Humaine' par M. Flourens 1855 page 143. Mr. Blyth says ('Indian Sporting Review' volume 2 page 137) that he has seen in India several hybrids from the pariah-dog and jackal; and between one of these hybrids and a terrier. The experiments of Hunter on the jackal are well-known. See also Isid. Geoffroy St.-Hilaire, 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 217, who speaks of the hybrid offspring of the jackal as perfectly fertile for three generations.) But these animals were closely confined; and many wild animals, as we shall see in a future chapter, are rendered by confinement in some degree or even utterly sterile. The Dingo, which breeds freely in Australia with our imported dogs, would not breed though repeatedly crossed in the Jardin des Plantes. (1/50. On authority of F. Cuvier quoted in Bronn's 'Geschichte der Natur' b. 2 s. 164.) Some hounds from Central Africa, brought home by Major Denham, never bred in the Town of London (1/51. W.C.L. Martin 'History of the Dog' 1845 page 203. Mr. Philip P. King, after ample opportunities of observation, informs me that the Dingo and European dogs often cross in Australia.); and a similar tendency to sterility might be transmitted to the hybrid offspring of a wild animal. Moreover, it appears that in M. Flourens' experiments the hybrids were closely bred in and in for three or four generations; and this circumstance would most certainly increase the tendency to sterility. Several years ago I saw confined in the Zoological Gardens of London a female hybrid from an English dog and jackal, which even in this the first generation was so sterile that, as I was assured by her keeper, she did not <b>fully</b> <b>exhibit</b> her proper periods; but this case was certainly exceptional, as numerous instances have occurred of fertile hybrids from these two animals. In almost all experiments on the crossing of animals there are so many causes of doubt, that it is extremely difficult to come to any positive conclusion. It would, however, appear, that those who believe that our dogs are descended from several species will have not only to admit that their offspring after a long course of domestication generally lose all tendency to sterility when crossed together; but that between certain breeds of dogs and some of their supposed aboriginal parents a certain degree of sterility has been retained or possibly even acquired.|$|E

30|$|Realizing {{the uniform}} {{dispersion}} of nanocarbons such as carbon nanotube and graphene in metals, {{is an essential}} prerequisite to <b>fully</b> <b>exhibit</b> their enhancement effect in mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of metal matrix composites (MMCs). In this work, we propose an effective method to achieve uniform distribution of nanocarbons in various metal flakes through a slurry-based method. It relies on the electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged nanocarbons and the positively charged metal flakes when mixed in slurry. For case study, flake metal powders (Al, Mg, Ti, Fe, and Cu) were positively charged in aqueous suspension by spontaneous ionization or cationic surface modification. While nanocarbons, given examples as carboxylic multi-walled carbon nanotubes, pristine single-walled carbon nanotube, and carbon nanotube–graphene oxide hybrid were negatively charged by the ionization of oxygen-containing functional groups or anionic surfactant. It was found that through the electrostatic interaction mechanism, all kinds of nanocarbons can be spontaneously and efficiently adsorbed {{onto the surface of}} various metal flakes. The development of such a versatile method would provide us great opportunities to fabricate advanced MMCs with appealing properties.|$|E

In this study, we focused on interactions between CaANCs and keratinocytes in culture and examined toxicity, internalization and drug release. Prior to cellular interactions, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy images showed that CaANCs appear as regular, spherical and dense particles, giving evidence of the surface gelation of CaANCs. Their size, around 200 nm, was stable under tested conditions (temperature, culture media, presence of serum and presence of encapsulated dye), and their toxicity on keratinocytes was very low. Flow cytometry assays showed that CaANCs are internalized into keratinocytes by endocytosis with a predominant implication of the caveolae-mediated route. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) demonstrated that after a 2 h contact, the release of CaANC contents in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes was almost complete. The endocytosis of CaANCs by a lysosome-free pathway, and the rapid release of their contents inside keratinocytes, will allow vectorized molecules to <b>fully</b> <b>exhibit</b> their pharmacological or cosmetic activity...|$|E

Cell surface-exposed TF is mainly cryptic and requires activation to <b>fully</b> <b>exhibit</b> the procoagulant potential.

In this study, we analyzed PDI contribution to coagulation using an in vitro endothelial cell model. In this model, extracellular PDI is detected by imaging and flow cytometry. Inhibition of cell surface PDI induces a marked increase in TF procoagulant function, whereas exogenous addition of PDI inhibits TF decryption. The coagulant effects of PDI inhibition were sensitive to annexin V treatment, suggesting exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), which {{was confirmed by}} prothrombinase assays and direct labeling. In contrast, exogenous PDI addition enhanced PS internalization. Analysis of fluorescent PS revealed that PDI affects both the apparent flippase and floppase activities on endothelial cells.

The notion of occupational communities has received considerable attention in the literature. More recently research findings report the existence of occupational cultures.

Support for the argument is gained from results of a qualitative study which indicated {{that there is a}} common occupational culture, which influences hotel workers to behave in a similar way regardless of the organisation they work for. A number of factors were identified that confirmed the existence of a hospitality occupational culture.

From this it is proposed that there exists a hospitality occupational culture which transcends the culture of organisations within which these individuals work, which does not <b>fully</b> <b>exhibit</b> defining characteristics of occupational communities and which governs the behaviour and performance of hospitality workers.

The model and associated theory provide a comprehensive explanation for deficits, such as semantic dementia, by appealing to the breakdown of attractors within a recurrently connected system following damage. We report findings from an attempted replication of the Rogers et al. model. While normal behaviour was reproduced, lesioning the reimplementation did not fully replicate the behaviour of the original model, meaning that the reimplementations contain healthy semantic representations which are in line with the hub theory, but the effects of damage on the structure of the semantic representations are not theoretically accounted for. The hub theory predicts that after damage semantic representations must decay in certain ways in order to give rise to patient behaviour. Our results show that the reimplementations do not <b>fully</b> <b>exhibit</b> these symptoms. This suggests that while semantic impairments reminiscent of patients may arise following lesioning of the hub model, such patterns are not a necessary consequence of the model as initially described.

The scorpion toxin α-KTx 12. 1 interacts with various K+ channels, suggesting its capacity to match diverse channel pores. It is recognized that tissue injuries may affect the pH at toxins site of action, thereby modulating both protein conformation and activity. To better understand its molecular mechanism of action, we studied α-KTx 12. 1 using pH {{as a tool to}} explore its plasticity and NMR in combination with MD calculations to detect it. The toxin solution structure consists of an α-helix and a triple-stranded β-sheet stabilized by four disulfide bridges. The NMR results show, in addition, that His 28 possesses an unusually low pKa of 5. 2. The best set of protein conformers is obtained at pH 4. 5, while at pH 7. 0, the reduced number of NOEs resulting from a faster hydrogen exchange does not allow to reach a good structural convergence. Nonetheless, MD calculations show that the toxin structure does not vary significantly in that pH range, while conformational changes and modifications of the surface charge distribution occur when His 28 is fully protonated. Moreover, essential dynamics analysis reveals variations in the toxin’s coherent motions. In conclusion, His 28, with its low pKa value, provides α-KTx 12. 1 with the ability to preserve its active conformation over a wide pH interval, thus expanding the range of cellular conditions where the toxin can <b>fully</b> <b>exhibit</b> its activity.

It is hence expected that ℓ 1 regularized channel estimation methods can improve channel estimation performance in the broadband wireless channels. However, it is well-known that the ℓ 2 multiburst (MB) channel estimation achieves the Cram´er-Rao bound (CRB) asymptotically. This is because the ℓ 2 MB technique formulated as a {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) problem improves the mean squared error (MSE) performance by utilizing the subspace projection. Performance analysis shows that ℓ 1 regularized channel estimation does not improve the MSE performance significantly over the ℓ 2 MB technique so far as the subspace channel model assumption is correct. We demonstrate, however, a receiver with ℓ 1 regularized channel estimation can improve bit error rate (BER) performance if the assumption is not always correct. For this purpose, we focus on intermittent transmission (TX) scenario which is defined as a generalized TX sequence having arbitrary length interruption between two continuous TX bursts. A receiver with the ℓ 2 MB method suffers from BER deterioration in an intermittent TX scenario having abrupt channel changes. As a solution to the problem, we propose a new algorithm which is a hybrid of ℓ 1 regularized least square (LS) and ℓ 2 MMSE channel estimation techniques. Simulation results show that the receiver with the proposed algorithm achieves a significant BER gain over that of the ℓ 2 MB technique in the intermittent TX scenario...|$|E

In an attempt to define genetic determinants of viral pathogenicity, we have molecularly cloned, sequenced, and characterized an attenuated isolate of HIV type 2 (HIV- 2 /ST) that differs from prototype HIV- 2 strains in its inability to fuse with and kill susceptible CD 4 -bearing target cells.

Nucleotide sequence analysis of this clone revealed a genomic organization {{very similar to that}} of cytopathic HIV- 2 strains and an overall nucleotide sequence homology of 88 to 90 %. Amino acid sequence comparison confirmed the integrity of all major viral gene products in JSP 4 - 27 but identified two amino acid sequence substitutions in its envelope fusion region. To investigate whether these mutations were responsible for the nonfusogenic phenotype of JSP 4 - 27, we amplified, cloned, and sequenced the envelope fusion regions of four additional HIV- 2 /ST strains, two of which represented in vitro-generated, fusogenic and cytopathic variants of HIV- 2 /ST. The analysis showed that all HIV- 2 /ST strains examined, including the fusogenic variants, contained the same amino acid sequence changes. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the attenuated phenotype of JSP 4 - 27, and that of its parental virus, is not due to a direct alteration of the envelope fusion domain.

Initially, we plan to digitize the four lifetime editions (1798, 1800, 1802, 1805) by compiling transcripts based on original printed volumes, marking these up with SGML in conformity with the TEl guidelines, and collating them with special software to discover variants and generate an apparatus criticus.

Every page of the digital transcription will be linked to digital images of the printed text, so that features like font, margins, and layout of stanzas on a page will be accessible. Our purpose is to show the development of the poems in the Lyrical Ballads collection, {{and in the case of}} the poems by Wordsworth to show how these evolved towards their 'final authorized' form. Cambridge University Press has undertaken to publish this electronic edition on CD-ROM in 1998, to commemorate the bicentenary of the first edition.

[...] Lyrically, the release furthers Lamar's exploration of psychological and politically-charged ideas, with references to spirituality and race featured throughout. Drowned in Sound also noted the thematic interplay between sexuality and oppression present in the release.|$|R
5000|$|The {{partnership}} {{was selected}} in 1897 to build three private residences, the [...] "La Fetra Mansion" [...] in Summit, New Jersey, a three-story Georgian mansion [...] "Laurel Hill" [...] in Columbia, North Carolina, and Donald McRae House in Wilmington, North Carolina. The [...] "La Fetra Mansion" [...] {{was designed and}} built by Bacon, and his design {{was published in the}} September 1901 issue of Architecture, the pre-eminent architectural professional journal of its time. The LeFetra Mansion <b>fully</b> <b>exhibits</b> Bacon's preference for Beaux-Arts Neo-Greek and Roman architecture style. His simple and elegant lines and his skill in dimensions and proportions gave rise to a stately elegance, peaceful tranquility, and a sense of divine protection. In 1897, Bacon was also approached by a group which was organized with the intent to raise public and private funds to build a monument in Washington, DC to memorialize Abraham Lincoln. Bacon began his conceptual, artistic, and architectural design for the Lincoln Memorial that year, and continued in the effort even though the funding for the building of the project did not materialize until years later. The Brite and Bacon Partnership dissolved in 1902 partly resulting from Brite's disagreement over Bacon's passion and the unpaid time he spent on the design. After that, Bacon practiced under his own name with significant success, building a large number of famous public buildings and monuments, until his death in 1924.|$|R

The cohesiveness of injectable bonegraft products is of high relevance when filling complex volume tric boned efects. With this motivation behind, BG particulates with mean sizes within 11 14 μm were mixed indifferent proportions with glycerol(G) and polyethyleneglycol(PEG) as organic carriers and the mixtures were <b>fully</b> injectable <b>exhibiting</b> Newtonian flow behavior...|$|R
