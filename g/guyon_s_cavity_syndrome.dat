The target chamber was subject to house the 18 O-enriched water bombarded with high energy proton beam to produce 18 F. A range of SRIM-computer simulations have also been conducted to calculate the ranges of several energetic proton beams (of up to 20 MeV) into pure water target. A study of radioactive impurities which might be produced from the proton-irradiated chamber 2 ̆ 7 s materials was also included based on some references. Due to concern over the heat produced during target irradiation, a heat transfer analysis - particularly for the target 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cavity</b> - was also included in the presented studies to obtain a brief preliminary calculation of the heating impacts prior to irradiation tests. The calculation was performed for various proton beam currents and energies of up to 30 μA and 20 MeV respectively.

40|$|Cornell University, in {{collaboration}} with Jefferson Labo-ratory, has proposed {{the construction of a}} prototype energy-recovery linac (ERL) to study the energy recovery con-cept with high current, low emittance beams [1]. The beam with a current of up to 100 mA will excite significant higher-order-mode (HOM) power in the superconducting (<b>s.</b> c.) RF <b>cavities</b> with frequencies up to 100 GHz. Strong damping of the HOMs is essential for beam stability and to reduce the HOM losses to a few hundred Watts per me-ter. To achieve this demanding goal we plan to place RF absorbing material in the beam tubes between the cavities in the linac. However, this will require operating the HOM absorbers at temperatures below 80 K to simplify the ther-mal transition to the cavities at 2 K with low static losses to 2 K. One possible material candidate is ferrite, as it is used at room temperature in the HOM absorbers in the <b>s.</b> c.

40|$|An {{inclusion}} complex between β-cyclodextrin and insoluble guest compounds {{has been reported}} by several researchers. The main purpose of forming an {{inclusion complex}} between β-CD and sparingly soluble guests is to enhance the guest 2 ̆ 7 s solubility and mask its undesirable properties. Preliminary {{studies have shown that}} when conjugated with target-specific moieties, these inclusion complexes can be used in pharmaceutical applications for drug delivery. β-Sitosterol, a plant sterol, has been well documented to reduce tumor cell growth and migration as well as exhibit apoptotic characteristics. An issue with this plant sterol and most pharmaceutical compounds is their lack of solubility. In this study, we propose that an inclusion complex will enhance the solubility of this sterol and change the physicochemical properties of the sparingly soluble guest. We first prepared the β-CD: β-Sitosterol inclusion complex and characterized the samples in both solid and solution state. The complex was characterized using FT-IR, DSC, SEM and NMR. IR studies of the inclusion complex and physical mixture revealed changes in the characteristic peaks of the inclusion complex suggestive of the formation of a new compound. 1 H NMR studies revealed an upfield resonance shift of β-CD internal protons (H 3 and H 5) as an equal molar ratio of β-Sitosterol is introduced into the β CD mixture. 2 D NOESY NMR studies suggest that the initial sites of interaction of β-CD and βSitosterol occur between the aliphatic tail of β-Sitosterol and H 3 of β-CD. 2 D ROESY NMR reveals that the cyclic head of β-Sitosterol also interacts with the cavity of β-CD suggesting that P-Sitosterol may be completely encapsulated inside β-CD 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cavity.</b> From these initial studies, we hypothesize that the β-CD-PEG-F A will facilitate absorption of β-Sitosterol and increase the drug delivery vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s solubility as a whole.
