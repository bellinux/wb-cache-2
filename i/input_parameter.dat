40|$|Preliminary notes The {{calibration}} {{process is}} a basic condition of traffic model application in local conditions. The choice of <b>input</b> <b>parameters,</b> which are used in calibration process, influences {{the success of the}} calibration process itself; therefore, the goal is to choose parameters with a larger influence on the modelling process. This paper offers a detailed analysis of car-following <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> and their influence on the modelled travelling time. The experimental basis was a one-lane roundabout, and the tool used for traffic simulation was the VISSIM microsimulation traffic model. The results show that the car-following <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> should {{be a part of the}} set of <b>input</b> <b>parameters,</b> which will enter the process of calibration.

30|$|Method to {{estimate}} shrinkage stress required several <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> which {{have to be}} experimentally determined simultaneously.

Thus, <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> may be used to set criteria for assessing shrinkage cracking tendency of repair material. If a model is developed with huge variety of parameters to be taken into account, it certainly will create complexity in setting criteria for assessing shrinkage cracking.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, two {{formulas}} {{were chosen}} {{among those that}} estimate the suspended sediment discharge in rivers. These two formulas were Lane and Kalinske and Bagnold. For studying and knowing the correlation between <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> and calculated suspended sediment discharge (CSSD), the SPSS 17 software was used. <b>Input</b> <b>parameters</b> in these two formulas were as: water velocity, water discharge, suspended sediment concentration, hydraulic radius, and depth. By entering <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> of these formulas into model, the results of both methods showed no significant correlation between CSSD and <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> except water discharge in Lane and Kalinske and water velocity in Bagnold. Other <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> have no good correlations with CSSD. Therefore, if Lane and Kalinske suspended sediment concentration and water discharge multiplied by each other and then equation powered by 0. 5, the correlation between this equation and CSSD become better than supposing them individually with CSSD...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> {{is essential to}} ensure the accuracy and reliability of hydrologic and water quality modelling. Calibration is an approach to obtain accurate <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> for comparing observed and simulated results. However, the calibration approach is limited as it {{is only applicable to}} catchments where monitoring data is available. Therefore, methodology to estimate appropriate model <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> is critical, particularly for catchments where monitoring data is not available. In the research study discussed in the paper, pollutant build-up parameters derived from catchment field investigations and model calibration using MIKE URBAN are compared for three catchments in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Additionally, the sensitivity of MIKE URBAN <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> was analysed. It was found that Reduction Factor is the most sensitive parameter for peak flow and total runoff volume estimation whilst Build-up rate is the most sensitive parameter for TSS load estimation. Consequently, these <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> should be determined accurately in hydrologic and water quality simulations using MIKE URBAN. Furthermore, an empirical equation for Southeast Queensland, Australia for the conversion of build-up parameters derived from catchment field investigations as MIKE URBAN <b>input</b> build-up <b>parameters</b> was derived. This will provide guidance for allowing for regional variations in the {{estimation of}} <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> for catchment modelling using MIKE URBAN where monitoring data is not available...|$|R
40|$|Pavement {{design is}} a {{probabilistic}} process as it involves many random variables. Through {{the incorporation of}} reliability, pavement design methods consider <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> variabilities effect on pavement performance. Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) is a typical example of reliability-based design procedure. In LRFD, a set of partial safety factors are developed by modelling <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> variabilities with representative average conditions. This paper evaluates the impact <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> variabilities have on estimated target reliability in the case when actual variabilities are different from assumed conditions. This was achieved by evaluating a field pavement section with various combinations of <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> variabilities. The optimized section for a given target reliability was achieved through the mechanics-based LRFD procedure and the actual reliabilities of the various cases were obtained using a methodology that uses response surface approach and first order reliability method (FORM).

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{studies the}} NGI-ADP soil model, which can realistically {{simulate}} the anisotropic undrained stress strain responses and undrained shear strengths of clays. The model requires direct <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> of undrained shear strengths and failure shear strains, including triaxial compression test, triaxial extension test and direct simple shear. However, parametric studies {{in this paper}} clearly show that trial-and-error testing of some <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> is {{necessary in order to}} determine the optimal set of <b>input</b> <b>parameters.</b> The paper proposes the equations of anisotropic stress strain curves of this soil model and the technique of soil parameter optimization so that the optimal set of <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> can be determined automatically and efficiently. The technique of soil parameter optimization is based on the statistical approach of least squares where proposed stress strain curves are used to compute model predictions. Finally, the proposed technique of soil parameter optimization of the NGI-ADP model is employed to determine the optimal set of <b>input</b> <b>parameters</b> for Bangkok soft clay...|$|R
