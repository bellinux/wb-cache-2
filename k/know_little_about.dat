A good analogy is trying to observe a marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies.

While such studies may tell us whether pre-modern Homo species had speech capacities, we still don't know whether they actually spoke. While no one doubts that they communicated vocally, the anatomical and genetic data lack the resolution necessary to differentiate proto-language from speech.|$|E

25|$|Lübeck {{remained}} organist of St. Nikolai {{until his}} death in 1740. One of his sons (also named Vincent, 16841755) assisted him from 1735 and succeeded him. During much of his career, Lübeck was a renowned teacher and organ consultant (passing judgements on, among others, Schnitger instruments). But we <b>know</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> his teaching activities; his pupils, aside from the two sons, included Michael Johann Friedrich Wiedeburg, a renowned keyboard pedagogue. Although J.S. Bach may have been influenced by Lübeck, they almost certainly never met. Lübeck's works were quickly forgotten with {{much of the rest of}} 17th and 18th century organ music. The first modern edition of the composer's work appeared in 1921 in Germany (G. Harms (Klecken, 1921)). A school in Stade was named in his honor, the Vincent Lübeck Gymnasium.|$|E

500|$|There was no duty {{to report}} a death to anyone in authority. Instead, each parish {{appointed}} two or more 'searchers of the dead', whose duty was to inspect a corpse and {{determine the cause of}} death. A searcher was entitled to charge a small fee from relatives for each death they reported, and so habitually the parish would appoint someone to the post who would otherwise be destitute and would be receiving support from the parish poor rate. Typically, this meant searchers would be old women who were illiterate, might <b>know</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> identifying diseases and who would be open to dishonesty. Searchers would typically learn about a death either from the local sexton who had been asked to dig a grave, or from the tolling of a church bell. Anyone who did not report a death to their local church, such as Quakers, Anabaptists, other non-Anglican Christians or Jews, frequently did not get included in the official records. Searchers during times of plague were required to live apart [...] from the community and stay indoors except when performing their duties, for fear of spreading the diseases. Outside they should avoid other people and always carry a white stick to warn of their occupation. Searchers reported to the Parish Clerk, who made a return each week to the Company of Parish Clerks in Brode Lane. Figures were then passed to the Lord Mayor and then to the Minister of State once plague became a matter of national concern. The reported figures were used to compile the Bills of Mortality, which listed total deaths in each parish and whether by plague. The system of Searchers to report the cause of death continued until 1836.|$|E
500|$|Terra's role in Birth by Sleep has {{received}} mixed critics with Adam Ghigiino from PALGN criticizing his naive personality when finding the three protagonists unappealing. VideoGamer.com writer Emily Gera stated that players may <b>know</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> them {{due to their}} role in Kingdom Hearts II, but with Birth by Sleep, players will able to know about them. Writing for GamesRadar, Crhis Antista commented {{that he did not}} understand the importance of him and the other characters being briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II, although it could be explained once the player finishes Birth by Sleep. PlayStation LifeStyle's Thomas Williams found the trio as welcome additions to the franchise, finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds. X-Play found Terra to be very similar to Riku due to his personality and vulnerability to evil's allure. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot criticized Jason Dohring's work as Terra's English voice actor, saying he [...] "can't express angst, excitement, sincerity, or any other emotion", affecting the storyline. VanOrd also pointed this out when Terra interacts with Disney characters, finding the latters' voice actors to be [...] "uniformly excellent and absolutely comparable to the original source." [...] Bob Miur from Destructoid compared Terra's storyline with the film [...] due to the struggles he faces, and found that gamers familiar to the series may realize that his fate in the game [...] "won't turn out to be very pretty." [...] Miur also commented on Dohring's work, praising how he makes Terra [...] "tortured and conflicted", but still criticizing the result. UGO Networks listed Terra's Helmet nineteenth on their list of [...] "The Coolest Helmets and Headgear in Video Games", stating [...] "For a minute, but only a minute, the two-horned helmet will get you feeling like the Keyblade is a viable weapon." [...] In a Famitsu poll, Terra was voted as the fifth most popular Kingdom Hearts character. Kimberly Wallace from Game Informer expected Terra, alongside his friends, to appear in the upcoming game, Kingdom Hearts III.|$|E

2500|$|The art {{historian}} Nancy Kelker of Middle Tennessee State University {{argues that a}} vague provenance, atypical stone, unusual carving of the back, nonstandard posture, recent publication of scholarly material on Olmec jades, and an urgent interest among Mexicans to find a myth for their origin in antiquity all {{suggest that it is}} a modern sculpture. [...] In response to these arguments, the archaeologist Michael Coe and the {{art historian}} Mary Miller, both of Yale University, defended the sculpture as authentic, arguing that its similarity to Monument 34 from the Olmec site San Lorenzo, {{and the fact that we}} <b>know</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> Olmec art make it probable that this is an Olmec masterpiece from antiquity. [...] At a separate time Coe stated that if Heizer felt the sculpture was a fake based on the petrographic analysis, then [...] "something must be wrong with the petrographic analysis!". [...] Susan Milbrath also argues against the possibility of a forgery. [...] Milbrath maintains that its 1933 discovery, well before archaeologists defined Olmec culture or excavated Olmec sites, precludes falsification.

2500|$|Two street racers, the Driver (Taylor) and the Mechanic (Wilson) live on {{the road}} in their highly modified, primer-gray, 1955 Chevrolet 150 two-door sedan drag car and drift from town to town, making their income by {{challenging}} local residents to impromptu drag races. [...] As they drive east on Route 66 from Needles, California, they pick up the Girl (Bird), a female hitchhiker, in Flagstaff, Arizona when she gets into their car at a diner. Although the Driver develops a crush on the Girl, she sleeps with the Mechanic when the Driver goes out drinking one night. In New Mexico, they begin to encounter another car driver, GTO (Oates), on the highways. An atmosphere of hostility develops between the two parties. Although GTO is not an overt street racer, and, in fact, seems to <b>know</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> cars, a cross-country race to Washington, D.C. is suggested. The Driver proposes that the prize should be [...] "for pinks," [...] or legal ownership of the loser's car.

After the 1998 embassy bombings by Al Qaeda, the CIA offered two targets to be hit in retaliation. One of them was the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, where traces of chemical weapon precursors had been detected. In the aftermath it was concluded that [...] "the decision to target al Shifa continues a tradition of operating on inadequate intelligence about Sudan."

2500|$|The Court {{has been}} criticized for keeping its {{deliberations}} hidden from public view. According to a review of Jeffrey Toobin's expose [...] "Its inner workings are difficult for reporters to cover, like a closed [...] "cartel", only revealing itself through [...] "public events and printed releases, with nothing about its inner workings". The reviewer writes: [...] "few (reporters) dig deeply into court affairs.

[...] A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll conducted in 2010 found that 61% of American voters agreed that televising Court hearings would [...] "be good for democracy", and 50% of voters stated they would watch Court proceedings if they were televised. In recent years, many justices have appeared on television, written books and made public statements to journalists. In a 2009 interview on C-SPAN, journalists Joan Biskupic (of USA Today) and Lyle Denniston (of SCOTUSblog) argued that the Court is a [...] "very open" [...] institution with only the justices' private conferences inaccessible to others.
