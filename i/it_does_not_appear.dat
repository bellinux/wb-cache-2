50|$|Council first {{appeared}} on the 1910 U.S. Census as Council City, although it was an unincorporated village. In 1920, the name was shortened to Council. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> on the 1930 census, but returned again in 1940 and 1950. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> again until 1990 when it was classified an Alaska Native Village Statistical Area (ANVSA).

5|$|B.spinulosa {{does not}} appear to be under threat.

5|$|These {{concerns}} aside, B.integrifolia {{does not}} appear to be under threat. It has excellent resistance to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, which poses a major threat to many other Banksia species; and its wide distribution protects against the threat of habitat loss due to land clearing.

5|$|A {{study of}} short-finned pilot whales off the {{southwest}} coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands {{has found the}} members of a pod maintained contact with each other through call repertoires unique to their pod. A later study found, when foraging at around 800 m deep, short-finned pilot whales make tonal calls. The number and length of the calls seem to decrease with depth despite being farther away from conspecifics at the surface. As such, the surrounding water pressure affects the energy of the calls, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> to affect the frequency levels.|$|E

It had a palace on the south side with three interior courtyards, the westernmost of which had a cross-shaped altar. The palace was smaller than those of the Ahpo Sotz'il and the Ahpo Xahil and {{is believed to have been}} the palace of the Ahuchan.|$|E

5|$|Predators of {{the tree}} sparrow include a variety of accipiters, falcons and owls, such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, common kestrel, little owl, and {{sometimes}} long-eared owl and white stork. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> to be at {{an increased risk of}} predation during its autumn moult, despite having fewer flight feathers at that time.

5|$|St Briavels Castle {{appears to}} date from Norman times, {{although}} the village itself predates the Norman period. The area {{was acquired by}} William FitzOsbern, the first Earl of Hereford in 1067, who built a number of castles across the region, including Chepstow, Monmouth, Clifford and Wigmore. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> that FitzOsbern built a castle on the St Briavels site, however, and the revolt of FitzOsbern's son, Roger de Breteuil resulted in the village being taken into the possession of the royal bailiffs of the Forest of Dean.|$|E
5|$|Superstition in the {{northeast}} (Maine and New Brunswick) relates how woodsmen would not harm gorbeys as they believed that whatever they inflicted on the bird would be done to them.

5|$|This bird may {{sometimes}} join mixed-species feeding flocks in winter, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> {{to share the}} resources found by accompanying tits and goldcrests, and may just be benefiting from the extra vigilance of a flock. Wood ants share the same habitat as the treecreeper, and also feed on invertebrates on tree trunks. The Finnish researchers found that where the ants have been foraging, there are fewer arthropods, and male treecreepers spent a shorter time on spruce trunks visited by ants.|$|E
5|$|Various {{stories have}} been told about Bregowine's origins, {{including}} {{that he was a}} nobleman and a continental Saxon who converted to Christianity and came to Canterbury because of the saintly reputation of Theodore of Tarsus. Others say that he owed his elevation to King Ã†thelbert II of Kent, but all these stories rest on works that were written after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. There are no contemporary records of Bregowine before he was archbishop. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear,</b> however, that he was of Mercian origins like his predecessors Tatwin and Nothhelm.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{appointed}} one {{justice to}} the Supreme Court of the United States, Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925. Stone was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus, a Wall Street lawyer and conservative Republican. Stone was serving as dean of Columbia Law School when Coolidge appointed him to be attorney general in 1924 to restore the reputation tarnished by Harding's Attorney General, Harry M. Daugherty. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> that Coolidge considered appointing anyone other than Stone. Stone {{proved to be a}} firm believer in judicial restraint and was {{regarded as one of the}} court's three liberal justices who would often vote to uphold New Deal legislation. President Franklin D. Roosevelt later appointed Stone to be chief justice.|$|E

5|$|Ruislip parish {{was owned}} by the Benedictine Bec Abbey of Normandy between 1096 and 1404 during which time the prior built a home for himself on the site, {{surrounded}} by a moat. During the 16th century, {{the remains of the}} motte-and-bailey site were used as the gardens of the Manor Farm House when it was built. In 1888 the moat extension was filled in by Henry James Ewer, who farmed on the site. The moat's shape and the presence of traces of a fortified building have allowed this part of the site to be dated to the 11th century. However, the castle {{is believed to have been}} built around 1066 then either demolished or changed significantly as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> as a castle in Domesday Book.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana further adds: Kabandha {{spent his}} days near the hermitage of the sage Matanga in the Krauncha forest. There, he spent his time scaring sages. Once, Kabandha {{attacked}} the sage Stulashira, who cursed him to remain in his hideous form for eternity. Upon Kabandha's pleading, the sage reduced his curse and said that Kabandha would be freed of his form, once Rama and Lakshmana sever his arms. So Kabandha waited in that forest for Rama's arrival. Growse suspected the tale to be a later interpolation arguing that <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> in all versions/translations of the original Ramayana.|$|E
5|$|While {{the cause}} of Crohn's disease is unknown it is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of environmental, immune and bacterial factors in genetically susceptible individuals. It results in a chronic inflammatory disorder, in which the body's immune system attacks the gastrointestinal tract possibly directed at microbial antigens. While Crohn's is an immune related disease, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> to be an autoimmune disease (in that the immune system is not being triggered by the body itself). The exact underlying immune problem is not clear; however, it may be an immunodeficiency state. About half of the overall risk is related to genetics with more than 70 genes found to be involved.|$|E
