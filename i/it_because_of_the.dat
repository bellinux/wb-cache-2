5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near <b>it.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E
5|$|Corrective rape is on {{the rise}} in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as {{estimated}} by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit. It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape live in fear of being sexually assaulted, as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008. Yet, victims of corrective rape are less likely to report <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E

50|$|Dreyfus {{claims that}} <b>the</b> {{plausibility}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> psychological assumption rests on two others: the epistemological and ontological assumptions. The epistemological {{assumption is that}} all activity (either by animate or inanimate objects) can be formalised (mathematically) in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> predictive rules or laws. The ontological assumption is that reality consists entirely {{of a set of}} mutually independent, atomic (indivisible) facts. <b>It's</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epistemological assumption that workers in the field argue that intelligence is the same as formal rule-following, and <b>it's</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ontological one that they argue that human knowledge consists entirely of internal representations of reality.|$|R

Although he is in love with Chloe, he does not admit <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clark-Lana-Chloe love {{triangle}} already in place. Ross was written out of the series at the end of season three, but made a guest appearance in season seven. Jones was the last of the series regulars to be cast, with Gough and Millar seeing him four days before they began filming the pilot. In the comics Ross is Caucasian, but the producers chose to cast Jones (who is African-American).|$|E
5|$|The curial {{cardinals}} {{entered the}} conclave seeking to elect Gregorio Barbarigo as pope. Leopold I, the Holy Roman Emperor, considered {{him to be}} an unacceptable choice {{because he was a}} Venetian. While Leopold did not formally exclude Barbarigo, he did not wish for him to be elected. In addition to Leopold, the Spanish ambassador in Rome worked against Barbarigo's election, and Louis XIV of France opposed <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wishes of his allies.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, the United States Weather Bureau began issuing {{tropical}} cyclone warnings as a collaborative observation network for cities along the U.S. coastline, and {{the season was}} defined between June 15 and November 15. In 1964, the season was extended to begin on June 1 and end on November 30, which remains the official length of the season. About 97% of all {{tropical cyclone}}s form within this time span, and activity usually peaks between August and October. After Tropical Storm Ana formed in May 2015, former American Meteorological Society president Marshall Shepherd used Twitter to question whether the season should begin earlier. James Franklin of the National Hurricane Center believed there was little advantage to changing <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rarity of off-season storms, noting that May storms only formed on average once every six years {{since the advent of}} satellite imagery. Franklin opined that the season could begin on May15 with little difficulty, coinciding with the beginning of the Pacific hurricane season, but an earlier start would be costlier and interfere with off-season work.|$|E

5|$|Music {{from the}} opera became {{the subject of}} {{numerous}} virtuoso works of the time. The brilliant transcription of its themes (Reminiscences de Robert le diable) made by the composer and virtuoso Franz Liszt was so popular that it became his calling card: {{on more than one occasion}} he was forced to interrupt his programmed concerts to play <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demands of the audience. On the day of its publication by Maurice Schlesinger, the edition of 500 was completely sold out and it had to be immediately reprinted. Indeed, the success of Robert, whose score was also published by Schlesinger, was said to have saved him from bankruptcy. Frédéric Chopin and Auguste Franchomme jointly composed a Grand duo concertant on themes from the opera, for cello and piano, in 1832, and the Italian pianist and composer Adolfo Fumagalli composed an elaborate fantasy on the opera for left hand alone as his Op. 106.|$|E
5|$|She later {{made her}} {{debut in the}} Winston Cup Series in the No. 84 Michael Kranefuss Racing Ford Taurus, and planned to run six races. The events were chosen because they were at tracks where Robinson felt comfortable, located in large markets where they would receive more attention. Her {{schedule}} was devised to allow Robinson time to test. She planned to race at Talladega Superspeedway but decided against <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rules regarding restrictor plate racing. Robinson failed {{to qualify for the}} first race she attempted (at California Speedway) when her car's rear-end gearing became detached causing her to collide with the wall. Four races later, she started from 32nd at Michigan International Speedway, and became the first woman to start a NASCAR Cup Series race since Patty Moise in 1989. Robinson finished 34th after spinning her car in the track's second turn but avoided damage. After she failed to qualify for her next two races, she was unable to complete her schedule due to sponsorship issues. Robinson stated that she used the season as motivation; she hoped to be driving consistently in five years, and wanted to be a spokesperson for women.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, Pillai is released. He brings {{news that}} Jackson has been {{transferred}} back to England on Davison's recommendation. At Kattabomman's court, a British messenger sent by Colonel Ooshington, Tirunelveli's new collector, reports that Pillai {{and his men}} have looted their granaries and killed their men at Srivaikuntam. Pillai justifies his act, saying that he instructed his men to do <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> famine conditions prevalent in their kingdom. Ashamed of Pillai's act, Kattabomman accuses him of injustice. Pillai apologises and offers himself as a prisoner to the British, but Kattabomman refuses to hand him over; instead he offers money to the British as compensation for the looted rice. Ooshington does not agree and, with Major Bannerman's and Ettappan's help, incites the neighbouring rulers to attack Kattabomman. Bannerman is placed {{in charge of the}} British troops. He and Ettappan plan to attack Panchalankurichi when the people are away attending a festival in Tiruchendur.
