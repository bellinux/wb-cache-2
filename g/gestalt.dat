40|$|Presented to 42 {{schizophrenic}} {{patients and}} 19 normals, {{by means of}} a percept-genetic technique, two motifs of mother and infant in close interaction (feeding and nursing). The motifs were tagged, by subliminal presentation, with aggressive resp. "healing" sentences, in a balanced design. No effects of this tagging were discernible. A cluster-analysis (Ward s method) of the material yielded 4 fairly well defined clusters characterised by 1) lack of <b>gestalts</b> 2) "groping" for <b>gestalts</b> 3) finding human <b>gestalts</b> 4) securing human <b>gestalts.</b> This was especially true of the Feeding-scene, being somewhat diffuse as regards figure/ground Prägnanz. The Nursing-scene clusters were characterised by 1) groping for <b>gestalts</b> 2) finding human <b>gestalts</b> 3) securing human <b>gestalts</b> 4) elaborating human <b>gestalts.</b> It was hypothesised that the (submanifest) anxiety produced by the motifs overshadowed and rendered too weak the effects of the verbal stimulation. A structured clinical interview, designed by the author, was administered to the sample and the results thorougly analysed (factor-analyses, item intercorrelations). This yielded in essence three factors: Anxiety-anger, Depression-distress and Relations to love-objects. These factors and many items had the discriminatory power to differ the two test groups fairly well. Finally interview-measures were related to percept-genetic measures by one way ANOVA yielding sometimes very clearcut relations. On the basis of the results the author suggests that schizophrenia should be considered a very heterogenous ailment, the cause of symptoms ranging from deficits to conflicts, the deficits ranging from organic to functional. Interesting differences were found between schizophrenic men and women, the women more "alert". A psychodynamic view of psychic development is recommended as the best possible frame of reference, well suited {{to the understanding of the}} results. An exstensive discussion of the dynamics of schizophrenia is included; lack of capacity for dissociation, primitive regression (non-linear as opposed to normal "linear"), disintegration and a conspicuous lack of <b>gestalting</b> capacity is advocated...|$|R

Four ovals on the horizontal midline were either unconnected or pairwise connected by circles, forming ears of {{left and right}} heads (<b>gestalts).</b> Relevant to responding was the position of one colored oval, either within its pair or relative to fixation ("object-based" or "fixation-based" instruction). Responses were faster under fixation- than object-based instruction, less so with <b>gestalts.</b> Previously reported increases of N 1 when evoked by features within objects were replicated for fixation-based instruction only. There was no effect of instruction on N 2 pc. However P 1 increased under the adequate instruction, object-based for <b>gestalts,</b> fixation-based for unconnected items, which presumably indicated how foci of attention were set by expecting specific stimuli under instructions that specified how to bind these stimuli to objects...|$|R

The role and impact of information architecture on the strategy-structure relationship are even less understood. Drawing on well developed theory and research {{in each of these}} areas, organizational <b>gestalts</b> or configurations are developed.

40|$|A storyscape is the {{new medium}} of storytelling. It {{originates}} in the model of transmedia storytelling defined by Henry Jenkins (2006 a) in Convergence Culture and applied to The Matrix franchise. The storyscape medium is conceptualized from the author/designer perspective as four <b>gestalts</b> that create a whole from stand-alone parts. The four <b>gestalts</b> are mythopoeia, character, canon, and genre. This approach frames the authoring of this story-centric model {{in opposition to the}} design approaches of world-building or storyworlds. The four <b>gestalts</b> also provide an academic approach that unites theory and practice with a unified design vocabulary and an orientation toward the creation of a cultural and creative product that is defined as the storyscape medium. Storyscapes, such as The Star Wars franchise or the Marvel Universe, consume the lion’s share of our cultural capital (Johnson 2014). Therefore, the development of a consistent vocabulary, a design approach, and an understanding of how they create meaning and define worldviews is critical to our understanding and practice of a new medium (Dena 2009). Starting with the frame of storytelling as a practice and previous aesthetic models such as The Poetics, this research charts the evolution of the storyscape medium across topics of academic transmedia approaches, principles, affordances, and the connecting or conceptualizing principles that act as <b>gestalts.</b> Ph.

Vygotsky shared Whorf's interest in <b>gestalt</b> psychology, and he also read Sapir's works. Others have seen similarities between Whorf's work and the ideas of literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, who read Whorf and whose approach to textual meaning was similarly holistic and relativistic. Whorf's ideas have also been interpreted as a radical critique of positivist science.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence for}} a path to multi-word combinations that differs from the generally acknowledged sequence: single words, successive single words, two-word combinations, longer constructions. The assumption {{has been that the}} major skill that a child needs to develop is how to produce one word and then follow it with another, incorporating both words in a single contour (Dore et al 1976, Branigan & Stokes 1981). However, a more detailed list of skills needed to combine words syntactically includes: 1) understanding the conventional nature of words; 2) learning a minimal number of conventionalized lexemes (both comprehension and production); 3) understanding the utility of verbal communication and several of its functions; 4) sufficient articulatory skill to allow the distinction at least some of these lexical items, although there will be transient homonymy; 5) the ability to produce coherent multisyllabic strings; 6) the ability to produce different prosodic contours. These skills eventually converge in the incorporation of two or more morphemes within a single intonational contour. In longitudinal data for one child we find a more convoluted path: there is a period of 1 - 2 months in which he produces multi-syllabic utterances with adult sounding contours that incorporate marginally identifiable adult words. We call these <b>Gestalts</b> after Peters 1977, 1983. On a 15 -minute tape at 1; 5. 06 he produces 22 different lexical items along with 10 "gestalty" utterances, all with conversational intonation. The longest is 11 syllables; five contain possible words or phrases: dontcha know, xx shoes on, a gonna fit'chu, xx a went away. A month later, during a half-hour at 1; 6. 07 he produces 40 different lexical items and 14 possible <b>Gestalts,</b> of which 12 seem to contain identifiable words or phrases, none of which he is "combining" in a conventional way. This phenomenon is noteworthy because, although not all children take this particular path, it is probably not confined to one child. It is all too easy to ignore <b>Gestalts,</b> both because we haven't expected them, and because there are neither tools nor theoretical frameworks for dealing with them. In the process of audiolinking and adding phonetics to a transcript at 18 months - one we had thought was completely analyzed - we heard a number of <b>Gestalts</b> not previously noticed. One of us had an analogous experience many years ago listening to a Norwegian colleague's phonetic transcriptions: she had noticed some extraneous uninterpretable vowels that she merely noted as V. From these and similar vowels in other languages we developed the notion of Filler Syllables (Peters 2001) Once a framework had been developed for Fillers they have been observed in many languages. It is now time to create an analytical framework for <b>Gestalts</b> and to look for them more widely. This talk will present audio examples of <b>Gestalts,</b> discuss how they change as more combinatorial language emerges, and explore how they could have been influenced by the input...|$|R

This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person.|$|E

40|$|Disturbances in the {{conscious}} access to visual information {{are a common}} consequence of brain damage to {{areas of the brain}} involved in visual and attentional processing. Recent advances in behavioural psychophysics have provided new paradigms with which to influence {{the conscious}} access to information in the visual system. Here we focus on one paradigm, which uses a continuously updating mask presented in one eye to suppress stimuli presented in the other eye in a situation of binocular rivalry. We ask whether this technique (Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS)) can provide a good model for the deficits in conscious access to information in visual neglect by asking whether the breakdown of suppression through CFS shows the same sensitivity to visual <b>Gestalts</b> as the release of extinction in patients with visual neglect. We tested this by adapting the 21 paradigm developed by Mattingley, Davis and Driver (1997) (and extended by Conci et al. (2009)) into the CFS paradigm. Our results suggest that <b>Gestalts</b> per se cannot be constructed without awareness for healthy observers when suppressing input using CFS, indicating that the changes in awareness in human observers using CFS may be different from those experienced in neglect. This does not help with our initial goal of using CFS as a model of neglect, but could provide {{a better understanding of the}} changes to consciousness in neglect and CFS.
