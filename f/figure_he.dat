5|$|On March 6, 1887, Beecher {{suffered}} a stroke and died in his sleep on March 8. Still a widely popular <b>figure,</b> <b>he</b> was mourned in newspapers and sermons across the country. Henry Ward Beecher is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
5|$|Alphonse Amadou Alley (April 9, 1930 – March 28, 1987) was a Beninese {{army officer}} and {{political}} <b>figure.</b> <b>He</b> was most active when his country {{was known as}} Dahomey. He was born in Bassila, central Dahomey, and enrolled in schools in Togo, Cote d'Ivoire, and Senegal before enlisting in the French army in 1950. He saw combat in Indochina from 1950 to 1953, in Morocco from 1955 to 1956, and in Algeria from 1959 to 1961. After the coup in 1965, President Christophe Soglo promoted Alley Chief of Staff of the Army. Young army officer Maurice Kouandété was appointed Alley's chef de cabinet in 1967.|$|E
5|$|As Nixon {{prepared}} for the August 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, he discussed possible running mates with his staff. Among these were Ronald Reagan, the conservative Governor of California, and the more liberal Mayor of New York City, John Lindsay. Nixon felt that these high-profile names could split the party, and looked for a less divisive <b>figure.</b> <b>He</b> did not indicate a preferred choice, and Agnew's name was not raised at this stage. Agnew was intending {{to go to the}} convention with his Maryland delegation as a favorite son, uncommitted to any of the main candidates.|$|E

50|$|<b>He</b> {{worked on}} <b>figure</b> carving and sold figurines {{in the local}} market in Oskarshamn. Most of the <b>figures</b> <b>he</b> sold were refined {{traditional}} wood carvings. Sometime around 1900 he began to carve in a minimalist style. These are the carved <b>figures</b> <b>he</b> is most famous for. Many of these carvings sold in the local market for ($1.00-$2.00)USD. Adjusted for inflation what cost $1.50 in 1900 would cost $33.23 in 2005.|$|R
5|$|Aside {{from his}} death, remarkably {{little is known}} of Cooke's circumstances. Even his date of birth is unclear, and unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society <b>figure.</b> <b>He</b> was however well {{respected}} in his profession and following his death {{was the subject of}} tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in St Paul's Cathedral and his local church in Wiltshire.|$|E
5|$|Having {{dominated}} Zimbabwe's {{politics for}} nearly four decades, Mugabe has been a controversial and divisive <b>figure.</b> <b>He</b> has been praised as a revolutionary hero of the African liberation struggle who helped to free Zimbabwe from British colonialism, imperialism, and white minority rule. Conversely, he has been derided as a dictator responsible for economic mismanagement, widespread corruption, anti-white racial discrimination, human rights abuses, suppression of political critics and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, he {{was elected}} as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives from Arizona's 1st congressional district. After serving two terms there and making an {{impression}} as a rising political <b>figure,</b> <b>he</b> was elected U.S. Senator from Arizona in 1986. He {{became one of the}} senators entangled in the Keating Five scandal of the late 1980s, but survived it and was re-elected in 1992 and 1998.|$|E

5|$|Moore's {{signature}} form is a reclining figure. Moore's {{exploration of}} this form, {{under the influence}} of the Toltec-Mayan <b>figure</b> <b>he</b> had seen at the Louvre, was to lead him to increasing abstraction as he turned his thoughts towards experimentation with the elements of design. Moore's earlier reclining figures deal principally with mass, while his later ones contrast the solid elements of the sculpture with the space, not only round them but generally through them as he pierced the forms with openings.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2009, Randazza {{was interviewed}} {{about the case}} on the WPRR radio program, Declaring Independence. He {{explained}} why Beck did not file a libel lawsuit in the United States. He pointed out that because Beck was a public <b>figure</b> <b>he</b> had to prove a legal standard referred to as actual malice, and show that Eiland-Hall knew his assertions were inaccurate. He explained that this {{did not apply to}} Eiland-Hall's website even if it was knowingly inaccurate, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell that no proof is needed for an absurd statement made in the context of satire.|$|E
5|$|Since 2002, he has {{operated}} the Jarome Iginla Hockey School in Calgary as a non-profit organization, donating proceeds to the Diabetes Research Association. In 2004, {{he was awarded}} the NHL Foundation Player Award for his community service and the King Clancy Memorial Trophy in recognition of his humanitarian contributions. Iginla supports many charities. In 2000, he began donating $1,000 per goal he scored to KidSport, a <b>figure</b> <b>he</b> doubled to $2,000 in 2005.

5|$|After {{the success}} of The Combat, Etty {{continued}} with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude <b>figure.</b> <b>He</b> was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, {{at that time the}} most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.|$|E

Hysteria erupts, and Michael becomes {{self-conscious}} over the commotion he has caused. He goes outside to fix the cable. There he is discovered by Erin, who throughout the evening {{has been trying to}} encourage Michael to bond with Gabe. Michael, still indignant over the idea that his office views Gabe as his boss, is initially irritated by her efforts, but eventually realizes that Erin views him as a father <b>figure.</b> <b>He</b> jokes around and tells her to go to her room, leading to a bonding moment between the two. As he leaves the party, Michael brings Gabe into the joke by threatening to kill him if he breaks Erin's heart.|$|E
5|$|Early Heian period works {{before the}} mid-10th century appear heavy {{compared}} to Nara period statues, carved from single blocks of wood, and characterised by draperies carved with alternating round and sharply cut folds. Stylistically, they followed high to later Tang style. In the Heian period the zōbussho were replaced with temple-run and independent workshops; wood became the primary medium; and a specific Japanese style emerged. By the mid-10th century, the style was refined presenting a more calm and gentle appearance, with attenuated proportions. Jōchō {{was the most}} important sculptor of this time, and he used the yosegi technique, in which several pieces of wood are joined to sculpt a single <b>figure.</b> <b>He</b> was the ancestor of three important schools of Japanese Buddhist statuary: the , Inpa and Keiha school. The Amida Nyorai at Byōdō-in is the only extant work by Jōchō.|$|E

5|$|Gauguin {{made three}} casts in 1894, each in {{partially}} glazed stoneware. Several other copies exist in plaster or bronze. His {{sale of the}} casts were not successful, and at a low financial and personal ebb he asked that {{for one of the}} reproductions to act as a marker for his grave. A cast was not placed there until 1973. There are only three other surviving comments of his on the figure: on an 1895 presentation mount of two impressions of a woodcut of the Oviri <b>figure</b> <b>he</b> made to Stéphane Mallarmé where he called the figure a strange and cruel enigma; in an 1897 letter to Ambroise Vollard where he referred to it as La Tueuse ("The Murderess"); and in a c. 1899 drawing where he appends an inscription referencing Honoré de Balzac's novel Séraphîta. Oviri was exhibited at the 1906 Salon d'Automne (no.57) where it influenced Pablo Picasso, who based one of the figures in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon on it.|$|E
5|$|Having seen Xavier chasing his son, Eric brutally assaults John {{and forces}} him {{to lead him}} to the house. John's sitting area is {{revealed}} to be a lift, which they use to leave the factory. The tech team tracks the video's source and Rigg leads his team to a house, where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images. As Kerry realizes the game took place before they found John, the timer expires and a large safe opens, revealing Daniel bound and breathing into an oxygen mask. Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked <b>figure.</b> <b>He</b> awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe; a tape recorder left by Amanda reveals that she is John's accomplice and intends to continue his work after he dies. Amanda {{appears in the doorway}} and seals the door, leaving Eric to die.|$|E
5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national <b>figure.</b> <b>He</b> decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter. He was surprised at {{how easy it was to}} get close to the president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his parents, would be good for the country. He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E

5|$|In October 1776, {{at the age}} of 17, Wilberforce went up to St John's College, Cambridge. The {{deaths of}} his {{grandfather}} and uncle in 1777 had left him independently wealthy and as a result he had little inclination or need to apply himself to serious study. Instead he immersed himself in the social round of student life and pursued a hedonistic lifestyle enjoying cards, gambling and late-night drinking sessions – although he found the excesses of some of his fellow students distasteful. Witty, generous and an excellent conversationalist, Wilberforce was a popular <b>figure.</b> <b>He</b> made many friends including the more studious future Prime Minister William Pitt. Despite his lifestyle and lack of interest in studying he managed to pass his examinations and was awarded a B.A. in 1781 and an M.A. in 1788.|$|E
5|$|Jervis {{was also}} {{recognised}} by {{both political and}} military contemporaries as a fine administrator and naval reformer. As Commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean, between 1795 and 1799 he introduced a series of severe standing orders to avert mutiny. He applied those orders to both seamen and officers alike, a policy {{that made him a}} controversial <b>figure.</b> <b>He</b> took his disciplinarian system of command with him when he took command of the Channel Fleet in 1799. In 1801, as First Lord of the Admiralty he introduced a number of reforms that, though unpopular at the time, made the Navy more efficient and more self-sufficient. He introduced innovations including block making machinery at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard. St Vincent was known for his generosity to officers he considered worthy of reward and his swift and often harsh punishment of those he felt deserved it.|$|E
5|$|This {{was how he}} {{personally}} designed many of the Sagrada Família's sculptures. He would thoroughly study the anatomy of the figure, concentrating on gestures. For this purpose, he studied the human skeleton and sometimes used dummies made of wire to test the appropriate posture of the <b>figure</b> <b>he</b> was about to sculpt. In a second step, he photographed his models, using a mirror system that provided multiple perspectives. He then made plaster casts of the figures, both of people and animals (on one occasion he made a donkey stand up so it would not move). He modified the proportions of these casts to obtain the figure's desired appearance, depending on {{its place in the}} church (the higher up, the bigger it would be). Eventually, he sculpted the figures in stone.|$|E
