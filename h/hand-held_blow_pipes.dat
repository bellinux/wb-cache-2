50|$|The <b>blow</b> <b>pipe</b> is a short, conical wooden or bone tube {{in which}} the player blows to refill the bag. At {{the end of the}} <b>blow</b> <b>pipe</b> that is within the bag, there is a small return valve of leather or felt which allows air into the bag via the <b>blow</b> <b>pipe</b> but not back out. In some more {{primitive}} gaida there is no flap, but the player blocks returning air with his tongue during breaths.|$|R

50|$|The cylindro-conoidal bullet {{was invented}} by Captain John Norton of the British 34th Regiment in 1832. It had a hollow base, so that, when fired, the bullet would expand and seal the bore. The origin of his idea is an {{interesting}} one: when in southern India, he examined the <b>blow</b> <b>pipe</b> arrows used by the natives and found that their base was formed of elastic locus pith, which by its expansion against the inner surface of the <b>blow</b> <b>pipe</b> prevented the escape of air past it.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{specific}} process {{devoted to the}} biorientation of PVC pipes is studied. It consists of the simultaneous blowing and stretching of an extruded pan: The tensile and impact properties of these pipes are analysed and compared to the performances of an usual extruded <b>pipe</b> and a <b>blown</b> <b>pipe</b> (no stretching). The blowing significantly increases {{the properties of the}} pipes in the orthoradial theta-direction. In the longitudinal z-direction, the tensile properties remain almost unchanged. Nevertheless, when impact properties are considered, the monooriented PVC exhibits very weak performances. The biorientation induced by an additional stretching makes the properties in the z-direction increase without decreasing the theta performance. Impact properties are significantly increased compared both to extruded <b>pipes</b> and <b>blown</b> <b>pipes.</b> This improvement in the properties is related to an important modification of the microstructure. The molecules of the PVC are oriented and the material behaves like a laminate composed of a great number of bioriented (theta-z) layers. The damage induced by impacts seems to be a delamination...|$|R

50|$|When a {{resonant}} system {{such as a}} <b>blown</b> <b>pipe</b> or plucked string is excited, {{a number}} of overtones may be produced along with the fundamental tone. In simple cases, such as for most musical instruments, the frequencies of these tones {{are the same as}} (or close to) the harmonics. Examples of exceptions include the circular drum, - a timpani whose first overtone is about 1.6 times its fundamental resonance frequency, gongs and cymbals, and brass instruments. The human vocal tract is able to produce highly variable amplitudes of the overtones, called formants, which define different vowels.|$|R
5000|$|The Bladder pipe (German: Platerspiel or Blaterpfeife) is {{a medieval}} {{simplified}} bagpipe, consisting of an insufflation tube (<b>blow</b> <b>pipe),</b> a bladder (bag) and a chanter; sounded by a double reed, which is fitted into a reed {{seat at the}} top of the chanter. The reed, inside the inflated bladder, is sounded continuously, and cannot be tongued. Some bladder pipes were made with a single drone pipe, and reproductions are similar to a loud, continuous crumhorn. The chanter has an outside tenon, at the top, near the reed, which fits into a socket or stock, which is then tied into the bladder.|$|R

25|$|In Central Africa simple {{crossbows}} {{were used}} for hunting and as a scout weapon, previously {{thought to have been}} first introduced by the Portuguese. Until recently they were especially in use by different tribes of the pygmy-people, usually with poisoned and relatively small arrows. This silent technique of hunting in the tropical forest is quite {{similar to that of the}} South American indigenous hunting method with <b>blow</b> <b>pipe</b> and poisoned arrows. It makes sure not to startle up the prey, for example if a first shot goes astray. Since the small arrow is rarely deadly itself, the animal will drop from the trees after some time because of the poisoning.|$|R

The tools for glass-blowing have changed little over the centuries and remain simple. An old Murano saying goes [...] "Good tools are nice, but good hands are better," [...] reinforcing the artistic nature of the glass-making process, which relies on the skill of the worker rather than the use of special tools.|$|R

50|$|The smithy, or the Panikkalari (literally: workplace), {{played an}} {{important}} role in the lives of ancient Tamils. Some of the essential items forged or repaired in the smithy include weapons of war, tools such as the plough, domestic utensils and the iron wheel. These ancient factories used a <b>blow</b> <b>pipe</b> or a pair of bellows (a turutti) to light the fire that was used for smelting and welding. These workplaces were not numerous, especially in the rural areas. Each smithy catered to the needs of many neighboring villages and hence was overworked. The art of the goldsmith seems to have caught the fancy of foreign markets and Tamil made ornaments were shipped to foreign lands mainly from karur.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} bottles or vessels {{were made}} by ancient man. Ingredients were melted to make glass and then clay forms were dipped into the molten liquid. When the glass cooled off, the clay was chipped out of the inside leaving just the hollow glass vessel. This glass was very thin as the fire was not as hot as modern day furnaces. The blowpipe was invented around 1 B.C. This allowed molten glass to be gathered {{on the end of}} the <b>blow</b> <b>pipe</b> and <b>blown</b> into the other end to create a hollow vessel. Eventually, the use of a mold was introduced, followed by the invention of a semi-automatic machine called the Press and Blow. In 1904 Michael Owens invented the automatic bottle machine.|$|R
