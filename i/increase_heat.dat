5|$|Some 2010 {{structural}} {{comparisons of}} Stegosaurus plates to Alligator osteoderms {{seem to support}} {{the conclusion that the}} potential for a thermoregulatory role in the plates of Stegosaurus definitely exists. This hypothesis has been seriously questioned,> since its closest relatives, such as Kentrosaurus, had more low surface area spikes than plates, implying that cooling was not important enough to require specialized structural formations such as plates. Another possible function is that the plates may have helped the animal <b>increase</b> <b>heat</b> absorption from the sun. Since a cooling trend occurred {{towards the end of the}} Jurassic, a large ectothermic reptile might have used the increased surface area afforded by the plates to absorb radiation from the sun.|$|E
25|$|The use of countercurrent heat {{exchange}} with blood flow allows for regulated conservation/ elimination of heat of appendages. When ambient temperatures are low, heterotherms will constrict their arterioles to reduce heat loss along skin surfaces. The reverse occurs at high ambient temperatures, arterioles dilate to <b>increase</b> <b>heat</b> loss.|$|E

Known as the thermoneutral range, this extends from [...] Below this temperature range, its metabolic rate increases significantly, although an individual can maintain its core temperature from [...] down to [...] Movement by swimming, walking, and shivering are three mechanisms for increasing metabolism; a fourth process involves an increase in the breakdown of fats by enzymes, which is induced by the hormone glucagon. At temperatures above , an emperor penguin may become agitated as its body temperature and metabolic rate rise to <b>increase</b> <b>heat</b> loss.

30|$|Besides, the HTC ratio <b>increases</b> with <b>increasing</b> <b>heat</b> flux at all {{operating}} temperatures. This {{effect can}} be explained by the Brownian motion, and the thermophoresis effect [28]. The thermophoresis effect holds that nanoparticles can diffuse under the effect of a temperature gradient. The diffusion increases with increasing temperature gradient. In the boiling heat transfer, a great temperature gradient exists for the nanofluid near the <b>heated</b> surface. It <b>increases</b> with <b>increasing</b> <b>heat</b> flux and correspondingly increases the diffusion of nanoparticles, and hence the heat transfer is enhanced. Meanwhile, higher temperature leads to stronger Brownian motion, which also enhances the energy transportation.
