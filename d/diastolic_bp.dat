This study examines the effects of HEx on BP in resistant hypertensive patients. MethodsThis is a parallel, randomized controlled trial. 125 nonconsecutive sedentary patients with resistant hypertension from a hypertension outpatient clinic in a university hospital were screened; 32 patients fulfilled the study requirements. The training was performed for 60 -minute sessions in a heated pool (32 °C), {{three times a week}} for 12 weeks. The HEx protocol consisted of callisthenic exercises and walking inside the pool. The control group was asked to maintain habitual activities. The main outcome measure was change in mean 24 -hour ambulatory BP (ABPM). Results 32 patients (HEx n= 16; control n= 16) were randomized; none were lost to follow-up. Office BPs decreased significantly after heated water exercise (36 / 12 mmHg). HEx decreased 24 -hour systolic (from 137 ± 23 to 120 ± 12 mmHg, p= 0. 001) and <b>diastolic</b> <b>BPs</b> (from 81 ± 13 to 72 ± 10 mmHg, p= 0. 009); daytime systolic (from 141 ± 24 to 120 ± 13 mmHg, p< 0. 0001) and <b>diastolic</b> <b>BPs</b> (from 84 ± 14 to 73 ± 11 mmHg, p= 0. 003); and nighttime systolic (from 129 ± 22 to 114 ± 12 mmHg, p= 0. 006) and <b>diastolic</b> <b>BPs</b> (from 74 ± 11 to 66 ± 10 mmHg, p< 0. 0001).

40|$|Background: Blockade of the reninâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 angiotensinâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 {{aldosterone}} {{system is}} a cornerstone in cardiovascular disease prevention and hypertension treatment. The relevance of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has been widely confirmed for both increasing the accuracy of blood pressure (BP) measurements, particularly in pharmacological trials, and focusing on 24 h BP prognostic parameters. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effects of canrenone addition on ambulatory BP in uncontrolled hypertensive patients already treated with the highest tolerated dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) antagonists plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCT). Methods: ABPM was performed at baseline and after 3 months of combination therapy in 158 outpatients with stage 1 or 2 hypertension who were randomized to add canrenone (50 or 100 mg) to the pre-existing therapy with ACE inhibitors or AT 1 R antagonists plus HCT. Twenty-four-hour systolic and <b>diastolic</b> <b>BPs</b> were considered normalized when the values were, 130 and, 80 mmHg, respectively.

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether ocular pulse amplitude (OPA) measured with dynamic contour tonometry (DCT) is related to systemic blood pressure (BP) parameters. METHODS: Blood pressure was measured continuously and simultaneously with OPA in one randomly selected eye in 29 healthy subjects. Systemic parameters of interest were: systolic and <b>diastolic</b> <b>BPs</b> and their difference (BP amplitude), and left ventricle ejection time (LVET; defined as the time between the diastolic trough and the incisural notch in the BP curve). In addition, the axial length (AL) of the eye was measured. Associations between OPA, AL and systemic cardiovascular parameters were analysed in a multivariate regression model. RESULTS: Measurements of OPA ranged from 1. 0 mmHg to 4. 9 mmHg (mean 2. 3 +/- 0. 9 mmHg, median 1. 9 mmHg). In a univariate analysis with one predictor at a time, means of intraocular pressure (IOP) (p = 0. 008), AL (p = 0. 046) and LVET (p = 0. 037) were significantly correlated with OPA, whereas systolic and <b>diastolic</b> <b>BPs</b> and their amplitude were not. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that mean IOP (p > 0. 005), AL (p = 0. 01) and LVET (p = 0. 002) all independently contributed to OPA. CONCLUSIONS: The OPA readings measured with DCT in healthy subjects were not related to BP levels and amplitude. It seems that the OPA strongly depends on the time-course of the cardiac contraction.

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that low diastolic blood pressure (BP) while receiving antihypertensive treatment (hereinafter called on-treatment BP) is harmful in older patients with systolic hypertension. We examined the association between on-treatment <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP,</b> mortality, and cardiovascular events in the prospective placebo-controlled Systolic Hypertension in Europe Trial. METHODS: Elderly patients with systolic hypertension were randomized into the double-blind first phase of the trial, after which all patients received active study drugs (phase 2). We assessed the relationship between outcome and on-treatment <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> by use of multivariate Cox regression analysis during receipt of placebo (phase 1) and during active treatment (phases 1 and 2). RESULTS: Rates of noncardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events were 11. 1, 12. 0, and 29. 4, respectively, per 1000 patient-years with active treatment (n = 2358) and 11. 9, 12. 6, and 39. 0, respectively, with placebo (n = 2225). Noncardiovascular mortality, but not cardiovascular mortality, increased with low <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> with active treatment (P <. 005) and with placebo (P <. 05); for example, hazard ratios for lower <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP,</b> that is, 65 to 60 mm Hg, were, respectively, 1. 15 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 00 - 1. 31) and 1. 28 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 03 - 1. 59). Low <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> with active treatment was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events, but only in patients with coronary heart disease at baseline (P <. 02; hazard ratio for BP 65 - 60 mm Hg, 1. 17; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 98 - 1. 38). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that antihypertensive treatment can be intensified to prevent cardiovascular events when systolic BP is not under control in older patients with systolic hypertension, at least until <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> reaches 55 mm Hg. However, a prudent approach is warranted in patients with concomitant coronary heart disease, in whom <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> should probably not be lowered to less than 70 mm Hg. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Many factors {{appear to}} {{influence}} diastolic left ventricular (LV) filling, including age, hypertension, and myocardial and coronary disease. Doppler-echocardiography {{was used to}} asses the influences of blood pressure (BP) on LV filling in 43 normotensive volunteers aged 12 ± 0. 98 years with heart rates ^ 90 beats/min. Doppler peak dia stolic transmitral flow velocities, diastolic flow integrals, and early diastolic deceleration were measured. An interesting difference was noted between the influence of systolic and <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP.</b> Systolic BP was related to LV mass (r = 0. 43; Ń < 0. 005), but was unrelated {{to any of the}} Doppler filling indices. <b>Diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> was unrelated to LV mass, but was inversely related to peak early diastolic flow velocity (ô = — 0. 37; Ń < 0. 05), early diastolic flow velocity integral (r = — 0. 34; Ń < 0. 05). The ratio of late-to-early filling (A/E) was directly related to <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> (r = 0. 42; Ń < 0. 005). The relationship between A/E and <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> was strong in subjects (n = 21) with bimodal Ń waves in electrocardiogram (ECG) lead Vj (r — 0. 61; Ń < 0. 005), but absent in those (n = 15) with unimodal Ń waves (ô = 0. 18; Ń = NS). Thus, the pattern of LV filling is related to the level of <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> in normal adolescents, especially in those with bimodal Ń waves on ECG.

The limited evidence suggests ethnic inequalities in BP in adults in some non-industrialised countries. However, {{it is unclear whether}} these ethnic inequalities in BP patterns in adults reflect on adolescents. Hence, we assessed ethnic differences in BP, and the association of BP with body mass index (BMI) among adolescents aged 12 – 17 years in Paramaribo, Suriname. Methods Cross-sectional study with anthropometric and {{blood pressure}} measurements. A random sample of 855 adolescents (167 Hindustanis, 169 Creoles, 128 Javanese, 91 Maroons and 300 mixed-ethnicities) were studied. Ethnicity was based on self-reported ethnic origin. Results Among boys, Maroons had a lower age- and height-adjusted systolic BP than Creoles, and a lower <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> than other ethnic groups. However, after further adjustment for BMI, only <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> in Maroons was significantly lower than in Javanese (67. 1 versus 70. 9 mmHg). Creole boys had a lower <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> than Hindustani (67. 3 versus 70. 2 mmHg) and Javanese boys after adjustment for age, height and BMI. Among girls, {{there were no significant differences}} in systolic BP between the ethnic groups. Maroon girls, however, had a lower <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> (65. 6 mmHg) than Hindustani (69. 1 mmHg), Javanese (71. 2 mmHg) and Mixed-ethnic (68. 3 mmHg) girls, but only after differences in BMI had been adjusted for. Javanese had a higher <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> than Creoles (71. 2 versus 66. 8 mmHg) and Mixed-ethnicity girls. BMI was positively associated with BP in all the ethnic groups, except for <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> in Maroon girls. Conclusion The study findings indicate higher mean BP levels among Javanese and Hindustani adolescents compared with their African descent peers. These findings contrast the relatively low BP reported in Javanese and Hindustani adult populations in Suriname and underscore the need for public health measures early in life to prevent high BP and its sequelae in later life. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{new blood}} {{pressure}} (BP) sensor, also named sphygmomanometer, is developed {{in this paper}} for estimating BPs accurately from fingertips. The hardware of the sensor is a low-cost optical CMOS imaging device for detecting pho-toplethysmography (PPG) signals at fingertips. Therefore, the sensor neither needs to contact human skin nor pressurize it for accurate BP predictions. To calculate BPs based on captured PPG signals, the modified radial resonance theory is applied {{to develop a new}} BP transport theory (BPTT), and then composes a computation algorithm for implementing BPTT in a typical smart phone with limited computation load required. The algorithm is successfully implemented in a typical smart phone with minimum computation load and equipped with an efficient calibration process. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the designed BP-sensing techniques. The resulted data clearly show that the difference between the systolic BPs (SBPs) sensed by the propose sensor and a validated cumbersome instrument is 1. 37 mmHg, while for <b>diastolic</b> <b>BPs</b> (DBPs) is − 1. 40 mmHg.

Such comparison proved that the elderly athletes have a significantly lower value in: systolic 24 -h BP; systolic and <b>diastolic</b> 24 -h <b>BP</b> variability; systolic and <b>diastolic</b> day-time <b>BP</b> variability; systolic night-time BP variability; 24 -h, day-time and night-time mean HR, as well as HR variability. Prolonged physical training improves, therefore, the parasympathetic control on the cardiovascular system in the elderly, which causes a low BP, HR, and a low related variability. Regular exercise induces {{a shift in the}} sympathetic:parasympathetic tone ratio towards a stronger parasympathetic influence. Such a neurovegetative tone seems to confer juvenile characteristics to the cardiovascular system of elderly athletes. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Previous Italian {{paediatric}} {{blood pressure}} (BP) tables overestimated {{the prevalence of}} hypertension in adolescents of specific geographic areas, such as Sardinia, {{an island in the}} Mediterranean Sea. This is probably due to a not very homogeneous distribution of the subjects studied, most from Middle and Northern Italy, and the long period from the survey. Methods BPs were repeatedly measured over a period of 3 years in 839 children (52. 6 % males. Age range: from 11 to 14 years during this period), using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer. For each gender, the specific percentile curves of systolic and <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> were constructed. Results (corrected by the 50 th percentile of height) Males (11 - 14 years) mean systolic BP (50 th centile) : from 111 to 115 mmHg. Hypertensive systolic BP (> 95 th percentile) : from 127 to 135 mmHg. Mean <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> (50 th centile) : from 65 to 69 mmHg. Hypertensive <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> (> 95 th percentile) : from 78 to 82 mmHg. Females(11 - 14 years) mean systolic BP (50 th centile) : from 110 to 112 mmHg. Hypertensive systolic BP (> 95 th percentile) : from 127 to 130 mmHg. Mean <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> (50 th centile) : from 65 to 67. Hypertensive <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> (> 95 th percentile) : from 78 to 80 mmHg. Conclusions Sardinian BP tables emphasizes the need to integrate the previous standards with more up-to-date and representative reports on Italian children, as periodically performed in the USA, in order {{to increase the number of}} subjects to be checked, and to obtain a national coverage better and more completely representative of every geographic area of our country. </p...|$|E
40|$|Summary Objective: To {{characterize}} the maximum P-wave duration (Pmax) and P-wave dispersion (PWD) according to blood pressure (BP) and uric acid (UA) levels in geriatric patients. Method: An analytical study {{was performed in}} 83 patients aged over 60 years treated at the Family Medical Office 5 of the Aracelio Rodríguez Castellón Polyclinic, in Cienfuegos, Cuba between January and December 2015. The sample was {{divided into two groups}} (patients with hyperuricemia and patients with normal UA levels). Results: We found a linear and significant correlation between <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> and Pmax in patients with hyperuricemia (r= 0. 695; p= 0. 026), but not in patients with normal UA (r= 0. 048; p= 0. 757). A linear and significant correlation was demonstrated between <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> and PWD in patients with hyperuricemia (r= 0. 657; p= 0. 039), but not in patients with normal UA (r= 0. 054; p= 0. 730). Conclusion: There is correlation between <b>diastolic</b> <b>BP</b> and Pmax plus PWD in elderly patients with hyperuricemia...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe prodrug {{droxidopa}} increases {{blood pressure}} (BP) {{in patients with}} neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. The BP profile of droxidopa in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension patients (n =  18) was investigated using ambulatory BP monitoring. Following dose optimization and a washout period, 24 -hour “off-drug” data were collected. “On-drug” assessment was conducted after 4 – 5  weeks of droxidopa treatment (mean dose, 444  mg, three times daily). Ambulatory monitoring off drug revealed that 90 % of patients already had abnormalities in the circadian BP profile and did not meet criteria for normal nocturnal BP dipping. On treatment, both overall mean 24 -hour systolic and <b>diastolic</b> <b>BPs</b> were higher compared to off drug (137 / 81  mm Hg vs. 129 / 76  mm Hg; P = . 017 /. 002). Mean daytime systolic BP was significantly higher with droxidopa (8. 4  ±  3. 1  mm Hg; P = . 014). Although nocturnal BP was not significantly higher on droxidopa versus off treatment (P = . 122), increases in nocturnal (supine) BP ≥ 10  mm Hg were observed in four cases (22 %). Severe supine systolic hypertensive readings at night (> 200  mm Hg) were captured in one case and only while on treatment. These data demonstrate that ambulatory BP monitoring is useful to evaluate the circadian BP profile after initiating treatment with a pressor agent...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Accurate blood {{pressure}} (BP) measurement {{depends on the}} reliability of oscillometric cuff pressure pulses (OscP) and Korotkoff sounds (KorS) for automated oscillometric and manual techniques. It has been widely accepted that respiration {{is one of the}} main factors affecting BP measurement. However, little is known about how respiration affects the signals from which BP measurement is obtained. The aim was to quantify the modulation effect of respiration on oscillometric pulses and KorS during clinical BP measurement. METHODS Systolic and <b>diastolic</b> <b>BPs</b> were measured manually from 40 healthy subjects (from 23 to 65  years old) under normal and regular deep breathing. The following signals were digitally recorded during linear cuff deflation: chest motion from a magnetometer to obtain reference respiration, cuff pressure from an electronic pressure sensor to derive OscP, and KorS from a digital stethoscope. The effects of respiration on both OscP and KorS were determined from changes in their amplitude associated with respiration between systole and diastole. These changes were normalized to the mean signal amplitude of OscP and KorS to derive the respiratory modulation depth. Reference respiration frequency, and the frequencies derived from the amplitude modulation of OscP and KorS were also calculated and compared. RESULTS Respiratory modulation depth was 14 and 40...|$|R

BackgroundProlonged antihypertensive therapy might be less effective in reversing the left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in uremics bearing the deleted (DD) allele of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene than in patients with the inserted (II) allele or in those heterozygous (ID) for the gene. MethodsThirteen DD and 17 II+ID hemodialyzed uremics were followed-up with yearly echocardiography and 24 -hour blood pressure (BP) monitoring over five years while on an antihypertensive therapy that included ACE inhibitors as first line drugs. ResultsIn the II+ID group there were significant decreases of the left ventricular mass index (LVMi) and of both systolic and <b>diastolic</b> <b>BPs.</b> These changes were less pronounced in the DD group, but {{the difference was not}} statistically significant given the wide overlap between the two groups. Further analysis of the data revealed that the only factor associated to a decreased LVMi was the decrease of the systolic BP irrespective of the ACE gene genotype of each individual patient. ConclusionsThe ACE-gene genotype does not necessarily predict the extent to which LVMi will be lowered by ACE-inhibitors therapy. The LVH of hypertensive uremics is amenable by long-term antihypertensive therapy provided that it results in significantly decreased systolic blood pressure...|$|R
