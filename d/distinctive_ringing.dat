It is a large crow-like bird, around [...] long on average, with yellow irises, and a heavy bill, and dark plumage with white undertail and wing patches. The male and female are similar in appearance. Six subspecies are recognised and are distinguished by overall plumage colour, which ranges from slate-grey for the nominate from New South Wales and eastern Victoria and subspecies plumbea from Western Australia, to sooty black for the clinking currawong of Tasmania and subspecies halmaturina from Kangaroo Island. All grey currawongs have a loud <b>distinctive</b> <b>ringing</b> or clinking call.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a very}} secretive bird, {{and despite}} its size is {{difficult}} to see as it slips through dense undergrowth.

50|$|Distinctive ring, marketed under {{a variety}} of names, is a service offered by a {{telephone}} company that establishes additional telephone numbers on the same line as an existing number, each number ringing with a <b>distinctive</b> <b>ringing</b> pattern.

50|$|The tone of {{the sound}} {{generated}} depends on the shape {{and size of the}} bell or gong resonator. Where several bells are installed together, they may be given <b>distinctive</b> <b>rings</b> by using different size or shapes of gong, even though the strike mechanisms are identical.|$|R
5000|$|On an {{external}} modem {{the status of}} the Ring Indicator pin is often coupled to the [...] "AA" [...] (auto answer) light, which flashes if the RI signal has detected a ring.

5000|$|On multi-party lines, ringers would {{typically}} {{be connected}} {{from one side}} of the two-wire line to ground; a [...] "tip party" [...] and [...] "ring party" [...] would have bells connected from opposite sides of the line. On a two-party service, each user would not hear ringing for calls to the other party. Some 20th-century independent telephone companies deployed four-party lines which used differing frequencies for selective ringing of individual parties (the four possible combinations were 20Hz or 30Hz from tip to ground, 20Hz or 30Hz from ring to ground). If additional parties were added to the same line, <b>distinctive</b> <b>ringing</b> patterns would need to be used to identify the called subscriber; these were audible to the multiple users on the line.|$|E

50|$|The {{three classes}} of prostanoids have <b>distinctive</b> <b>rings</b> {{in the center}} of the molecule. They differ in their structures.

In prostacyclins, this ring is conjoined to another oxygen-containing ring. In thromboxanes the ring becomes a 6-member ring with one oxygen.|$|R

2500|$|... {{literally}} means [...] "the three ranks", {{even though}} it actually comprises four ranks. The discrepancy arose because the yokozuna was traditionally regarded as an ōzeki with a special license to wear a particular rope around his waist and perform a <b>distinctive</b> <b>ring</b> entry ceremony.
