40|$|A vector {{approach}} is presented here to analyze survey questions. The survey questions are designed as bi-polar constructs. Participants rated the usefulness, ease of use, and {{look and feel}} of six tools on a scale from 1 to 7. The vector method treats each answer as an element in a p-dimensional vector, where p corresponds to the number of participants. The response vectors are then compared to a reference vector. The percentages of usefulness, ease of use, and look and feel are calculated using the projection of the response vectors onto the reference vector. A clear advantage of the vector approach over statistical methods {{is that it does not}} invoke assumptions typically associated with those statistical methods. Thus the vector method can be applied to a wider variety of data sets, and the results are non-ambiguous compared to the statistical techniques. While the statistical method indicates that the participants seemed to have interpreted the three questions equally, the vector method shows clearly that the questions are not coincident and care must be taken in drawing the right conclusions. Other results specific to the experiment described herein are that the highest rating from the participants was for the Info Workspace tool and the lowest was the EBP tool suite. Also, Common Intent depended on variables other than technology. Nevertheless, the technology should be optimized to eliminate it as a potential <b>detrimental</b> <b>variable...</b>|$|E
40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that water {{can act as a}} <b>detrimental</b> <b>variable</b> in performance of pharmaceutical dosage forms. Derivatives of various starches and cellulose are widely used as excepients, generally in high proportions to the total amount making up the dosage form. A complete understanding of the uptake of moisture by cellulose polymers is important because moisture-polymer interaction affects various properties such as compressibility and stability. In this study I) hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), 2) modified HPMC (SEPPIC®), 3) microcrystaline cellulose containing carrageenan (Lusterclear®) were used for studies of moisture polymer interaction. The interaction of moisture with these polymers was assessed using a simple and precise sorption system, which allows a rapid measure of uptake and loss of moisture. The effect of temperature on the sorption behavior of the film was alsoexamined. All the three excepient films displayed sorption isotherms that were classified as type II (Langmuir) and demonstrated hysteresis during desorption. The BET model could be used restrictively but the GAB model fitted the data over the entire range of water activity under study. The Young 2 ̆ 6 Nelson model was successful in modeling hysteresis phenomenon but did not offer any mechanistic details. Thermodynamic analysis of water-excepient film system has also been performed to understand the mechanistic details of moisture-excepient interactions. Partial molal free energies, enthalpies and entropies were calculated for the three 11 (polymeric films. Results from the theoretical methods are useful for the predictive purpose where as thermodynamic studies offered mechanistic details of water-excepient interaction. A comparative study of the theoretical models and thermodynamic studies showed that the results from both the approaches were not always analogues to each other. In conclusion, I) dynamic vapor sorption is very useful in investigation of waterexcepient interaction 2) it is necessary to apply both theoretical models and thermodynamic concepts for complete understanding of water-excepient interactions...|$|E
50|$|The Landsat-MSS {{is one of}} {{the most}} common used tools. It is capable of {{detecting}} and categorizing snow cover into three zones for data calculations.The first zone is an area with 100% snow cover. The second zone is known as the transition zone, which is a mixture of snow covered regions and non snow covered regions. This zone is commonly measured at a 50% snow composition value. The Final zone is snow-free (=aper). The combined reading of these three measurements creates a relatively accurate estimate for the amount of snow within the scanned region. Several <b>detrimental</b> <b>variables</b> for this technique are cloud cover, extreme sunlight and heavy vegetation.|$|R
40|$|Weak {{disposability}} of outputs {{means that}} firms can abate harmful emissions by decreasing the activity level. Modeling weak disposability in nonparametric production analysis has caused some confusion. This article identifies a dilemma in these approaches: conventional formulations implicitly and unin-tentionally assume all firms apply uniform abatement factors. However, {{it is usually}} cost-effective to abate emissions in those firms where the marginal abatement costs are lowest. This article presents a simple formulation of weak disposability that allows for non-uniform abatement factors and preserves the linear structure of the model. Key words: activity analysis, data envelopment analysis, environmental performance analysis, non-parametric productivity analysis, pollution abatement, production theory, undesirable outputs. Modeling undesirable outputs (such as emis-sions of harmful substances in air, water, and ground) and other detrimental side-effects of production activities (such as noise) has attracted considerable attention among production economists. A common approach is to treat <b>detrimental</b> <b>variables</b> as inputs, based on the economic argument that both inputs and detrimental side-effects incur costs for a firm and thus firms are usually interested in decreasing both types of variables {{as much as possible}} (Cropper and Oates). From technical perspective, however, emissions to the envi-ronment usually represent outputs for a firm. According to Färe and Grosskopf (2003, 2004), the treatment of undesirable outputs as inputs is inconsistent with the physical laws and the standard axioms of production theory. These authors advocate an alternative approach that models undesirable emissions as outputs, im-posing an assumption that these undesirable outputs are weakly disposable. Weak dispos-ability generally means {{that it is possible to}} abate emissions by decreasing the level of pro-duction activity...|$|R

This method allows estimation of adsorption (k 1) and desorption (k 2) microrate constants. It was found that k 1 varied exponentially with water activity for the polymeric film showing predictive utility of such a relationship. The dramatic influence that film thickness and temperature may have on water sorption of films has been demonstrated. Results from application of theoretical models and thermodynamic analysis were not always consistent. Established models are useful for quantitative analysis, whereas thermodynamic analysis allows qualitative insights into water-excipient film interaction. Young 2 ̆ 6 Nelson model was successful in accurately modeling the hysteresis phenomena but did not offer any information on the mechanistic details. Computation of isoteric heats of adsorption confirmed hydrogen bonding as the reason for hysteresis and allowed determination of number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule. Comparison of weighted relative partial molal free energies of excipient film and water showed that assumption of adsorbent to be an inert participant in the sorption process as being incorrect for both excipients at all temperatures. In conclusion, (a) hot melt coating methods {{are an interesting}} alternative to aqueous coating techniques (b) dynamic vapor sorption is very useful in investigation of water-excipient film interactions, and (c) it is necessary to apply both theoretical models and thermodynamic concepts for complete characterization of water interaction with excipient films...|$|E
40|$|There {{is often}} a {{significant}} trade-off between formulation strength and size in mixed integer programming (MIP). When modelling convex disjunctive constraints (e. g. unions of convex sets) this trade-off can be resolved by adding auxiliary continuous variables. However, adding these variables {{can result in a}} deterioration of the computational effectiveness of the formulation. For this reason, there has been considerable interest in constructing strong formulations that do not use continuous auxiliary variables. We introduce a technique to construct formulations without these <b>detrimental</b> continuous auxiliary <b>variables.</b> To develop this technique we introduce a natural non-polyhedral generalization of the Cayley embedding of a family of polytopes and show it inherits many geometric properties of the original embedding. We then show how the associated formulation technique can be used to construct small and strong formulation {{for a wide range of}} disjunctive constraints. In particular, we show it can recover and generalize all known strong formulations without continuous auxiliary variables...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{agriculture}} having high complexity, especially {{related to}} the choice of using inputs that could potentially harm the environment or often called a detrimental input. In order to realize sustainable agriculture, the level of efficiency {{of the use of}} these inputs must be able to measure, especially from the aspect of environmental efficiency. The objective of this research in to analyze the environmental efficiency (EEnv) with a <b>detrimental</b> input <b>variable</b> namely the Nitrogen surplus in shallot farming through approach Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). At the initial stage has been built translog stochastic frontier regression model consisting of the response variable namely the production of onion, five independent variables, namely land, seed, Phospor fertilizer, Kalium fertilizer, labor and pesticides, as well as one independent variable is a surplus of nitrogen as a detrimental input. Stochastic frontier translog regression models were built to explain some of the interactions between several independent variables affect the production of shallot. Some interactions are significant, namely seeds and pesticides, fertilizer P with a surplus of nitrogen, and the interaction between K fertilizer with nitrogen surplus. From the regression model can also be calculated value of elasticity, where the elasticity of independent variables namely seed is the highest, equal to 0. 1687. Furthermore stochastic frontier translog model can be calculated value EEnv, the results show the value of EEnv still low at only at 0. 2765. This may imply inefficient shallot farmers from the aspects of the environment, especially if {{associated with the use of}} nitrogen fertilizer. Although technically shallot farmers have achieved a level of technical efficiency (ET), which is indicated on the ET value of 0. 9475...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of this work was to verify the response of basil cultivars to the salinity of irrigation water {{during the period from}} January 15 to March 20, 2013, in a greenhouse, at the Federal Rural University of the Semi-Arid, Mossoró, RN, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized, with treatments arranged in 2 x 4 factorial scheme, constituted of two cultivars of basil (&# 8216;Verde&# 8217; and &# 8216;Roxo&# 8217;) and four levels of irrigation water salinity (0. 5; 2. 0; 3. 5 and 5. 0 dS m- 1), with four replicates. The plants were collected at 65 days after transplanting and the following variables were evaluated: stem diameter; plant height; number of stems and leaves; leaf area; dry matter of leaves, stems, roots, and total dry matter. The increase in salinity was <b>detrimental</b> to all <b>variables</b> evaluated in both cultivars, but the cultivar &# 8216;Roxo&# 8217; proved to be more tolerant than the cultivar &# 8216;Verde&# 8217;.

40|$|Vegetable {{production}} {{could be}} increased through horizontal expansion, development {{of modern technology}} and vertical expansion such as efficient use of readily available resources. Third approach of using available resources more efficiently is more viable since, {{there is no need}} to make extra efforts to bring new area under vegetable cultivation and or changing cropping pattern. Similarly, new investment is not needed to develop modern technology. This implies that vegetable production could be increased through boosting up productivity. This will not only increase availability of vegetables in the country but it will also pick up income of vegetable growing farmers. Keeping in view the importance of vegetables in terms of income and essential nutrients, the present study was designed to determine technical efficiency and profitability of growing vegetables in Punjab. Four vegetables namely potato, carrot, radish and bitter gourd were chosen. Stochastic frontier production function was employed to ascertain level of technical efficiency and its determinants. Stochastic frontier production function and ordinary least square (OLS) estimates were used to determine yield level of vegetable production. On the basis of these estimates, profitability of vegetables was estimated. Results of the study showed that OLS was not appropriate method for the given data-sets of vegetables. Moreover, translog production function was preferable over Cobb-Douglas production function on the basis of log likelihood ratio test. Derived production elasticity estimates indicated that seed, plant protection measures, irrigation, labour used to perform various farming activities and use of NPK nutrients were significantly contributing in vegetable yields with few exceptions. It was also found out that irrigation in radish and NPK nutrients in potato production were negatively influencing the yield of respective vegetables. The reasons lie in the fact that the radish growing farmers were using sewage water to irrigate radish crop during shortage of canal water and the use of sewage water badly distressed radish yield, whereas in case of potato production, farmers were using NPK nutrients above the recommended level. Considering determinants of technical efficiency, it was found out that with an increase in age of the vegetable growers, level of technical efficiency declined except in potato production where it was positively related to respondents' age. Education was positively related to technical efficiency implying that the highly educated vegetable growers were using available resources more efficiently. Family size was negatively related to level of technical efficiency in cultivation of all vegetables except bitter gourd. Ownership status had a mixture of effect on the level of technical efficiency. One of the important findings of the study was impact of farm area on technical efficiency. This variable indicated that with increased farm area, technical efficiency declined due to the fact that vegetable growers were able to apply latest technology on the farms because of availability of financial resources. Access to extension services were found declining level of technical inefficiency in vegetable cultivation. Environmental <b>detrimental</b> <b>variables</b> namely fertilizer and plant protection measures were positively related to level of technical efficiency indirectly indicating that vegetable yield had increased at the expense of environmental degradation. Therefore, research is required to determine optimum level of these inputs in vegetable production and other crops. Mean level of technical efficiency was 82 percent in radish, 72 percent in carrot, 70 percent in potato and 66 percent in bitter gourd indicating that there existed potential to increase vegetable production by using existing resources more efficiently. The most profitable vegetable was found bitter gourd followed by carrot, potato and radish. The lowest cost per kg was estimated in carrot cultivation whereas the highest one was found out in bitter gourd production. Coefficient of variation (CV) was determined for net income per acre. Results showed that the minimum value of CV was found out in carrot production and the maximum was recorded in potato production showing that potato production is more risky compared to other vegetables...|$|R

Their etiology is multifaceted. There is scientific evidence pointing to environmental variables being risk factors. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze and quantify the impact on a daily and a weekly basis of PM 2. 5, NO 2 and O 3 (μg/m 3), noise levels (Leq), and temperature (°C) on <b>variables</b> <b>detrimental</b> to health in Madrid from 2001 till 2009. Poisson regression models were prepared from an ecological study of time series, and the results were expressed in terms of the Relative Risk (RR). The environmental variables were included in previously identified explanatory delays. 298, 705 births were analyzed: the average weekly prematurity was 7. 5, the average low weight 6. 9, and the average fetal mortality 3. 7. In the case of preterm births, a relation with PM 2. 5 during the 2 nd quarter of pregnancy [RR: 1. 026 (1. 018 - 1. 034) ] and with Leq in the week prior to childbirth [RR: 1. 020 (1. 012 - 1. 028) ] was detected. This impact was also noticeable in the daily results. In addition, heat waves also affect prematurity.
