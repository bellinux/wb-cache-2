40|$|According to the {{situation}} that almost all the power quality systems (PQM) focus on the transmission network rather than the distribution network (DN), a distribution network power quality monitoring system (DNPQMS) based on metering automation systems is proposed in this paper. This DNPQMS can {{take full advantage of}} the power data collected by the existing <b>intelligent</b> <b>terminals</b> that set throughout the DN. The DNPQMS is divided into three parts, including equipment layer, data layer and application layer. The equipment layer consists of power quality monitoring devices, including the power quality monitoring device based on dual-CPU platform and <b>intelligent</b> <b>terminals</b> of other manufacturers. The data layer completes the power data storage and integrated that collected by the <b>intelligent</b> <b>terminals.</b> The application layer completes the day-to-day maintenance and management of the system {{as well as a number}} of advanced applications.

50|$|The Intel 8008 was the world’s first single-chip 8-bit CPU and, {{like the}} 4004, was built with {{p-channel}} SGT. The 8008 development was originally assigned to Hal Feeney in March 1970 but was suspended until the 4004 was completed. It was resumed in January 1971 under Faggin’s direction utilizing the basic circuits and methodology {{he had developed}} for the 4004, with Hal Feeney doing the chip design.

IBM executives did not recognize value in software as a revenue-generation product until after federal law required software unbundling. In 1980, IBM executives failed to heed Ben Riggins' strong suggestions that IBM should provide their own EBCDIC-based operating system and integrated-circuit microprocessor chip for use in the IBM Personal Computer as a CICS <b>intelligent</b> <b>terminal</b> (instead of the incompatible Intel chip, and immature ASCII-based Microsoft 1980 DOS).|$|E

40|$|The last 15 {{years have}} seen a {{tremendous}} growth in the exchange of bibliographic records between organizations which has been assisted by advances in information technology. The library community has developed UNIMARC and the abstracting and indexing community are using the UNISIST Reference Manual to facilitate the transfer of bibliographic data between databases. Unesco is establishing a Common Communication Format {{in an attempt to}} bridge the gap between the library and A & I communities. However, different practices in record creation between organizations providing records mean that records from different sources cannot always be merged com fortably into one database even if they have been converted into the same exchange format. One way of achieving the necessary compatibility between records from different sources is by editing the records as they are received. This can be time-consuming and can make the use of records from outside sources uneconomic. New technology, in the form of <b>intelligent</b> <b>terminals,</b> can make this more of a practical proposition. Records can be obtained on-line from external databases and can then be changed either by the intervention of the operator or by programs in the terminal which can make changes to the data or tags of particular fields before adding the records to the file. Very little research has been done on the economics of using <b>intelligent</b> <b>terminals</b> to edit records but this kind of operation is likely to increase in the future as more bibliographic systems using <b>intelligent</b> <b>terminals</b> are developed...|$|R

50|$|Ray and Roche {{wanted to}} develop a new more <b>intelligent</b> <b>terminal,</b> and {{employed}} a trio of engineers who knew each other from their interests in Amateur Radio: Victor Poor, Harry Pyle and undergraduate Jonathan Schmidt. While working his notice from Maryland-based Frederick Electronics during the 1969 Thanksgiving holiday, Poor and Pyle produced the underlying architecture of the modern microprocessor on a living room floor. They then asked Schmidt to write the accompanying communications software. Pitching the idea to both TI and Intel, the partnership developed the Intel 8008, the forerunner of the microprocessor chips found in today's personal and computing devices.|$|E
50|$|One of the 90x's biggest {{advantages}} over {{the competition was}} its asynchronous serial port controller (the ITS or <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Terminal</b> Server) based on a 16-bit bit-slice processor. The ITS interfaced to 16 serial ports, and it could run them at very high speeds, using DMA to feed from daisy-chained output data blocks. A machine could have many ITSs installed, each one with its own I/O processor. Other machines at the time (including the 11/780) required CPU intervention every few bytes for interactive users, which added significantly to the system component of the CPU load. As a result, the 90x scored very well on benchmarks with a realistic amount of serial I/O.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{commercial}} licensing of CP/M {{took place in}} 1975 with contracts between Digital Systems and Omron of America for use in their <b>intelligent</b> <b>terminal,</b> and with Lawrence Livermore Laboratories where CP/M was used to monitor programs in the Octopus network. Little {{attention was paid to}} CP/M for about a year. In my spare time, I worked to improve overall facilities … By this time, CP/M had been adapted for four different controllers. … In 1976, Glenn Ewing approached me with a problem: Imsai, Incorporated, for whom Glenn consulted, had shipped a large number of disk subsystems with a promise that an operating system would follow. I was somewhat reluctant to adapt CP/M to yet another controller, and thus the notion of a separated Basic I/O System (BIOS) evolved. In principle, the hardware dependent portions of CP/M were concentrated in the BIOS, thus allowing Glenn, or anyone else, to adapt CP/M to the Imsai equipment. Imsai was subsequently licensed to distribute CP/M version 1.3 which eventually evolved into an operating system called IMDOS. [...] Gary Kildall ...|$|E
