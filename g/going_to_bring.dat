5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt was especially difficult for Jodie Foster, who was hounded relentlessly {{by the media}} during 1981 because she was Hinckley's target of obsession. Since then, Foster has only commented on Hinckley on three occasions: a press conference {{a few days after}} the attack, an Esquire magazine article she wrote in 1982, and during an interview with Charlie Rose on 60 Minutes II in 1999; she has otherwise ended or canceled several interviews after the event was mentioned or if the interviewer was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> up Hinckley.|$|E

He then reportedly said that his son and his son's friend had slit the throat of Özgecan, before severing her hands. He claimed that his son wanted to keep her body at his father's house, but as he refused, they burned the body at a remote area, after which he also burned Özgecan's blouse, scarf, books and the strap of her bag.|$|E

25|$|Still, in {{his three}} outings {{he had done}} a respectable enough job, and he was {{thought to have been}} in the frame for a few Formula One seats come 1995. As it turned out, Larrousse folded, and the only deal that came his way was to drive the Simtek {{in the second half of}} 1995 as Jos Verstappen's teammate, with Schiattarella racing in the first half of the year. Even so, the deposit Noda paid for the seat and the money he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> to the team was of massive {{importance}} to the cash-strapped operation.|$|E
25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and they thought I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives.

500|$|Libby is {{a mysterious}} {{character}}, {{seated at the}} tail-section of the plane. Her character was written {{to be in her}} late forties to early fifties, easy on the eyes, amicably maladjusted, and a compulsive liar so good at what she does, most people will not know she is not what she seems. Damon Lindelof was quoted in Variety as saying the character [...] "is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> a flavor to the show that doesn't exist right now.

500|$|The {{cast and}} crew were very {{emotional}} during filming, as they were concerned {{that this might be}} the last episode ever filmed and the series cancelled if the strike was a lengthy one.

500|$|Trevor Noah also avoided talking {{too much}} about Fox News, as Stewart was {{previously}} known for. [...] "The Daily Show {{was based on an}} emerging 24 hour news cycle, that’s everything it was, that’s what inspired The Daily Show. Now you look at news and it’s changed. It’s no longer predicated around 24 hour news. There are so many different choices. Half of it is online now. Now you’ve got the 'Gawker's, the 'Buzzfeed's. The way people are drawing their news is soundbites and headlines and click-bait links has changed everything. The biggest challenge {{is going to be an}} exciting one I'm sure is how are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> all of that together looking at it from a bigger lens as opposed to just going after one source — which was historically Fox News" [...] Noah said at a press conference before the shows debut.|$|E

500|$|The {{video is}} similar to the director's cut, but has a few differences. The choreography cut offers lengthier shots of Spears and her dancers, and much of the apocalypse storyline is edited out. The clip's ending is also {{different}} from the original: instead of emerging from the manhole Spears just looks into the camera, apparently still hiding in the underground party and hinting at a darker ending in which the world does end. On April 9, 2011, Spears tweeted that she had seen the final cut of the dance version, and was not sure which one she liked best. Ray Kay tweeted on April 14, 2011, that the original version of the video was better, [...] "but it's fun to watch the choreography too." [...] The video, titled [...] "DANCE Till the World Ends" [...] premiered on April 15, 2011.

In the finals, Tarwater was exactly tied with Phelps and on world-record pace through the first 50 meters. He stayed near Phelps for 150 meters before fading on the last 50. In the last 25 meters, he was passed by Gil Stovall, who beat his personal best by a second and a half, to finish third. Tarwater also swam a new personal best – 1:54.46 – but it was not good enough to make the Olympic team, missing out by six-tenths of a second. After the race, he briefly considered retiring before deciding to finish the meet.

5000|$|Some {{opponents of}} Molinism claim that God's fore{{knowledge}} {{and knowledge of}} counterfactuals are examples of what God is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> actively <b>bring</b> about. That is, when Christ describes {{the response of the}} Sodomites in the aforementioned example, God was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> actively <b>bring</b> it about that they would remain until today. [...] Molinists have responded to this objection by noting that scripture contains examples of God's foreknowledge of evil acts. For example, the Israelites forsaking God, or Peter's denial of Christ, are both examples of what one would call overt acts of sin. Yet, according to opponents of Molinism, God is actively bringing about these overt acts of sin. This is fallacious according to the Molinist. In order for this account of prophecy to be valid all prophecies must be wholly good, and never contain evil acts; but this is not what opponents believe to be the case.|$|R
