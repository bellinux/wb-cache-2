Within the social {{group of the}} priests at court, it had by Classical times become customary to deify the numbers {{as well as the}} basic <b>day-unit,</b> and – particularly in the south-eastern kingdoms of Copan and Quirigua – to conceive the mechanism of time as a sort of relay or estafette in which the 'burden' of the time-units was passed on from one divine numerical 'bearer' to the next one. The numbers were personified not by distinctive numerical deities, but by some of the principal general deities, who were thus seen to be responsible for the ongoing 'march of time'. The day-units (k'in) were often depicted as the patrons of the priestly scribes and diviners (ah k'in) themselves, that is, as Howler Monkey Gods, who seem to have been conceived as creator deities in their own right. In the Postclassic period, the time-unit of the katun was imagined as a divine king, as the 20 named days still are among the traditional 'day-keepers' of the Guatemalan Highlands. On a more abstract level, the world was assumed to be governed by certain fundamental numbers, first of all the numbers 13 and 20 that, multiplied, defined both the mantic day count and, on a vast scale, the amount of time elapsed before the first day (5 Imix 9 Kumk'u) of the Long Count.|$|E

40|$|Stroke is {{a leading}} cause of {{disability}} worldwide and affects mostly elderly people. Neurorehabilitation is important for reducing the long-term consequences of stroke, aiming to achieve an optimal functional recovery for home and community reintegration. Physiotherapy is the most common rehabilitation intervention, {{and the role of the}} physiotherapist is mainly focussed on improvement in motor function. One of the most important functions of the central nervous system is to coordinate posture and movement to stabilise the body during movements and perturbations. Trunk control is a central aspect of postural control, and has been found to be impaired after stroke. There is limited knowledge on trunk control after stroke, and further studies are warranted. The thesis comprises three studies; one methodological, one translational and one intervention study. The overall aim was to broaden our understanding and knowledge of trunk control in patients with stroke. The objective of Paper I was to translate the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), a measure of trunk control in patients with stroke, into Norwegian and to explore its construct validity, internal consistency, intertester and test-retest reliability. Data from 201 patients with stroke were used to explore construct validity by Item Response Theory and factor analysis. In this process, one of the subscales, static sitting balance, was omitted, and the remaining 14 items were included in six ordinal scales, and named the Trunk Impairment Scale – modified Norwegian version, TIS-modNV. After this modification, the TIS-modNV fitted well to a locally dependent unidimensional Item Response Theory model with one general factor which we call trunk control, and two content specific factors: lower and upper trunk stability. The scale demonstrated excellent construct validity, high internal consistency (alpha 0. 85) and high intertester (ICC 0. 77) and test-retest (ICC 0. 85) reliability for the total score, supporting its use to evaluate trunk control in patients after stroke as well as other central nervous system disorders. We believe that we achieved a satisfactory translation and cross-cultural adaptation. The objective of Paper 2 was to explore the relationship between middle cerebral artery lesion locations (MCA) and trunk control post stroke, and to compare trunk control between patients with lesions in different single and multiple locations, and between left and right hemispheres. A total of 109 patients with acute stroke in the MCA territory were examined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tested for trunk control using TIS-modNV. To determine the location and extent of the lesion, the MRI scans were scored using the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS), which scores 10 areas in the supply area of the MCA. Single lesion locations were found in 38 of the patients, and data from these formed the basis for further analyses. We found that an ASPECT lesion location in the anterior part of the MCA territory, called M 5, demonstrated a hemispheric differentiation for trunk control. Patients with right M 5 lesion locations achieved significantly poorer scores on trunk control as compared to left, p = 0. 030. However, there were few patients with M 5 lesion locations (n = 19), and too few patients to investigate a relationship between other ASPECT locations and trunk control. The results indicate that there is a cortical regulation of trunk control and that the two hemispheres may have different roles in this regard. Paper III was a group comparison study in the context of a randomised controlled trial. Three different rehabilitation models: two for early supported discharge either in a <b>day-unit</b> or in the patients’ own homes, and one traditional uncoordinated treatment were compared for change in physical function after acute stroke. Several outcome measures for balance and walking were used. The Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke was the primary outcome, and TIS-modNV one of the secondary outcome measures. We used data from 167 patients at baseline, 52 in the <b>day-unit</b> group, 60 in the home-rehabilitation group and 55 in the control group. There were no differences between the groups for baseline characteristics or physical function, and no differences between the groups for length of stay in the stroke unit; mean (SD), min-max: 8. 6 (3. 3) days, 3 - 17, p = 0. 948. The patients had an overall mild to moderate disability, and high scores on PASS. There was a substantial loss to follow-up with 62. 9 % of the patients being retested at three months, but no significant differences between the retested groups for baseline characteristics. We found no differences in change between the groups for PASS, p > 0. 05. We did find differences between the groups for some secondary measures: trunk control, median (95 %CI) : <b>day-unit,</b> 2 (0. 28, 2. 31); home-rehabilitation, 4 (1. 80, 3. 78); control, 1 (0. 56, 2. 53), p = 0. 044, and self-report on walking, p = 0. 021, and ADL, p = 0. 016, with a tendency to favour the intervention groups over the control group. Mean walking speed improved above minimally important change only in the <b>day-unit</b> group. Bonferroni adjusted pairwise comparisons gave no differences between the groups for trunk control; for self-report on walking, the <b>day-unit</b> group improved more than control, p = 0. 004. For self-report on ADL there was a difference between the home-rehabilitation and the control group, p = 0. 006. We concluded that with regard to secondary outcomes, multidisciplinary, coordinated rehabilitation tended to be more effective than traditional treatment. In summary, we found that the TIS-modNV has satisfactory measurement properties and can be recommended for use in clinical practice as well as in research. Using the TIS-modNV and ASPECTS, we found indication for a cortical regulation of trunk control, as well as a relationship between lesion location, hemispheric differentiation and trunk control. PASS demonstrated a substantial ceiling effect, and three months after acute stroke no difference was found in change between the groups. On a group level, rehabilitation using coordinated multidisciplinary rehabilitation favoured trunk control, and self-reported walking and ADL. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Guidelines advise that {{patients}} receiving palliative {{care should be}} given realistic information about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and encouraged to participate in decisions about this. For many patients attending a hospice, CPR {{is unlikely to be}} successful because of advanced disease. It is difficult to predict which patients would like to discuss CPR and whether such discussion might cause distress. Aim: This research set out to determine the acceptability and understanding of a patient information leaflet about CPR given to inpatients and <b>day-unit</b> patients in one hospice, and to seek patients’ views on communication about resuscitation. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with five hospice inpatients and one dayunit patient and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis for emergent themes. Results and conclusions: The leaflet was acceptable to the participants but was interpreted {{in the context of their}} understanding of their illness and prognosis. The leaflet alone is not a reliable method of communicating resuscitation policy and should be followed up by the opportunity to ask questions, if the patient wishes. Many factors influence patient choices about CPR. Realistic information about prognosis and about the risks and harms of CPR would allow patients to make a better-informed decision. However, if a patient prefers not to talk about their prognosis and end-of-life issues, then this should be respected...|$|E
40|$|The study {{took place}} at a public {{psychiatric}} hospital’s <b>day-unit,</b> in the municipal district of Fortaleza-Ceará-Brazil. Its main objective was to identify {{the meaning of the}} mental disorders for the relatives of the diseases carriers. This study consisted on a qualitative-ethnographic research. The informers who took part on the investigation were 20 disease carriers’ relatives, mostly mothers, from predominant low socioeconomic level. Data were collected through the following instruments: participative observation, semi-structured interviews containing eight opened questions and a field diary. Data were analyzed by means of the content analysis referential. In what concerns the meaning that the relatives attribute to the mental upsets, it was possible to observe that they relate such phenomena to disease, unbalance, suffering and great complication. In respect to the causes they attribute to the disease there were detected biological, psychological and social causes. Concerning companionship, it was observed that it varied from harmonious to blocked. In relation to the supposed consequences and marks of that conviviality, there were configured the following categories: trauma, disharmony, frustration and stress. When asked about handlings and feelings in face of the presented crises, it was observed that they demonstrate anguish as well as patience. After this research, it was possible to conclude that a mental upset is still a not understood phenomenon, difficult to deal with, filled with preconceptions and stigmas by the disease carrier’s relatives...|$|E
40|$|Background: Day care is {{increasingly}} {{being used for}} complications of pregnancy, {{but there is little}} published evidence on its efficacy. We assessed the clinical, psychosocial, and economic effects of day care for three pregnancy complications in a randomised trial of day care versus standard care on an antenatal ward. Methods: 395 women were randomly assigned day (263) or ward (132) care in a ratio of two to one, stratified for major diagnostic categories (non-proteinuric hypertension, proteinuric hypertension, and preterm premature rupture of membranes). The research hypothesis was that for these disorders, as an alternative to admission, antenatal day care will reduce specified interventions and investigations, result in no differences in clinical outcome, lead to greater satisfaction and psychological wellbeing, and be more cost-effective. Data were collected through case-note review, self-report questionnaires (response rates 81 · 0 % or higher) and via the hospital's financial system. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings: All participants were included in the analyses. There were no differences between the groups in antenatal tests or investigations or intrapartum interventions. The total duration of antenatal care episodes was shorter in the day-care group than in the ward group (median 17 [IQR 5 – 9] vs 57 [35 – 123] h; p= 0 · 001). Overall stay was also significantly shorter in the day-care group (mean 7 · 22 [SE 0 · 31] vs 8 · 53 [0 · 44]; p= 0 · 014). The median number of care episodes was three (range one to 14) in the day-care group and two (one to nine) in the ward group (p= 0 · 01). There were no statistically or clinically significant differences in maternal or perinatal outcomes. The day-care group reported greater satisfaction, with no evidence of unintended psychosocial sequelae. There {{was no significant difference in}} either average cost per patient or average cost per day of care. Interpretation: Since clinical outcomes and costs are similar, adoption by maternity services of a policy providing specified women with the choice between admission and <b>day-unit</b> care seems appropriate...|$|E
