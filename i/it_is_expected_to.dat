5|$|A ruling of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 6 August 2017 {{decided that}} a disputed {{military}} facility in Han Pijesak is to be registered as property of Bosnia and Herzegovina. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be a precedent for all other similar facilities, and could thus be the final factor that will enable the activation of the MAP for Bosnia. An August 2010 poll showed that 70 {{percent of the country}} supports NATO membership, but results were very different in the two constituent entities. While 90 percent of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina supported NATO membership, only 33 percent in Republika Srpska did.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> have different electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E

5|$|Due to its extreme {{distance}} from the Sun, Planet Nine would reflect little sunlight, potentially evading telescope sightings. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> have an apparent magnitude fainter than 22, making it at least 600 times fainter than Pluto. If Planet Nine exists and is close to its perihelion, astronomers could identify it based on existing images. For its aphelion, the largest telescopes would be required. However, if the planet is currently located in between, many observatories could spot Planet Nine. Statistically, the planet {{is more likely to}} be closer to its aphelion at a distance greater than 500 AU. This is because objects move more slowly when near their aphelion, in accordance with Kepler's second law.|$|E

In 2012, the European Space Agency's selected the JUpiter ICy moon Explorer (JUICE) as its first Large mission, replacing its contribution to EJSM, the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter (JGO). The partnership for the Europa Jupiter System Mission has since ended, but NASA will continue to contribute the European mission with hardware and an instrument.|$|E
