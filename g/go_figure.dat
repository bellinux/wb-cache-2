500|$|While {{brainstorming}} {{for ideas}} to the game's plot, Sakamoto decided to create an original story instead of remaking a Metroid game because he [...] "always [...] to do something really unprecedented, something people have never played before". He continued, saying, [...] "Many of our designers and creators want to challenge something new rather than simply porting over an old title. That's something I hope we'll always do. If you can challenge something new, you {{can look forward to}} the public response, be it good or bad." [...] The game introduces gameplay mechanics that are new to the Metroid series. Metroid Fusion offers a more direct, almost mission-based structure that supports the player to explore areas. Objectives are also flexible in how they can be completed, acting [...] "more as a guide for what the player should do instead of giving a completely blank map and saying 'Here you <b>go,</b> <b>figure</b> out what to do and how to do it.|$|E
500|$|Variety Brian Lowry {{deemed the}} adult cast of early Glee [...] "over-the-top buffoons", however opined that Emma offered [...] "modest redemption".

[...] Harris commented that, [...] "Despite the sad {{seriousness}} of , the tightly wound Emma also {{is one of the}} funniest characters in Glee. <b>Go</b> <b>figure.</b> It's funny, because everything is kind of heavy that's going on in her life, with these phobias and this guy she loves who’s married, yet she still is a bit of the comic relief." [...] Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly noted of the episode [...] "Vitamin D" [...] that she had hoped Emma would decline Ken's proposal: [...] "I want Emma to be strong and know it’s better to be without someone for the right reason than to be with someone for the wrong one." [...] Mike Hale for the New York Times praised Mays' performance in the episode. He noted: [...] "Jayma Mays registered Emma’s devastation with just the slightest widening of those enormous eyes. In fact all the best non-singing moments in the episode were hers." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Rush" [...] has {{generally}} received critical acclaim from music critics. Rachel Brodsky of MTV gave a positive review towards the song, writing [...] "It's true -- we're not totally {{used to hearing}} Kelly exploring her country side (though she is from Texas, so <b>go</b> <b>figure),</b> but judging by the vocals on [...] "Don't Rush," [...] we think we could get used to Country Kelly". Sam Wilbur of AOL Radio complimented the song for being [...] "a feel-good track with a nostalgic, classic country feel". Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song four stars and a half, writing [...] "It’s difficult for a female vocalist to sound sexy without drawing criticism. Clarkson’s voice is a wine and roses romance, instead of the wanton yearn of a beauty in a too-short skirt. The original ‘American Idol’ may have found her niche." [...] Michaelangelo Matos of New York Post gave the song three stars out of five and praised Clarkson for [...] "getting completely into character" [...] and successfully delivering the emotion of the song. Mark Blankenship of Logo complimented Clarkson for embracing her country side. Calling the song as [...] "a good song", he concluded his review by writing [...] "Even better, it’s a flirty, seductive love song, not a furious break-up anthem, which is a nice change after ten years of Kelly’s heartbroken rage." [...] Chuck Dauphin of Billboard ranked [...] "Don't Rush" [...] at number eight in his list of Top 10 Country Songs of 2012, writing [...] "One of the most luscious sounding love songs I have heard in a while. It's the definition of 'Ear Candy.' If you’re not in love, you'll want to be after hear it." ...|$|E
