25|$|Ice {{cream is}} a {{colloidal}} emulsion having dispersed phase as fat globules. It is an emulsion {{which is in}} the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which is frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, ice, milk <b>fat,</b> <b>milk</b> protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in far are non polar and will adhere to itself by van der Waals interactions. Water is polar thus, emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and will not give hard texture.|$|E

40|$|A pair of monozygous twin cows {{was used}} to {{investigate}} {{the influence of the}} increased availability of linoleic acid (18 : 2) to the mammary gland, on the structure and physical properties of the milk triacylglycerols (TGs). The cows were grazing fresh pasture, and in addition one of the pair was provided with a daily supplement of encapsulated sunflower oil. The <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> of the cow given the supplement (18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat)</b> contained 15. 5 % 18 : 2 compared with 1. 8 % 18 : 2 in the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> of the other cow (control <b>milk</b> <b>fat).</b> This increase in the proportion of 18 : 2 in the <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> was accompanied by decreases in the proportions of myristic acid (14 : 0) and palmitic acid (16 : 0). The effect of this altered fatty acid (FA) composition on the TG composition of the 18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> was to increase the proportions of TGs with 40, 52 and 54 acyl carbons and to decrease the proportions of TGs with 34, 36, 38, 44, 46, 48 and 50 acyl carbons relative to the proportions in the control <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> Both <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> samples were separated, by column chromatography on silicic acid, into TG fractions of high, medium and low molecular weight. The relative proportions of the TG fractions of high, medium and low mol. wt. in the 18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> were 43. 0, 19. 5 and 37. 5 % respectively compared with 36. 1, 19. 7 end 44. 2 % respectively in the control <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> Stereospecific analysis of these triacylglycerol fractions demonstrated that in fractions of similar mol. wt., the distribution of fatty acids within the TG molecule in the presence of high levels of 18 : 2, was not appreciably altered from that in the triacylglycerol fractions of the control <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> The positional distribution of fatty acids in the triacylglycerols of the total <b>milk,</b> <b>fats</b> was also similar. In the <b>milk</b> <b>fat,</b> containing high levels of linoleic acid, 18 : 2 showed a preference for positions 1 and 2 in the triacylglycerols of the low and medium mol. wt. fractions, and for positions 2 and 3 of the high mol. wt. fraction. The three TG fractions of each <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> were further resolved into TG classes of differing levels of unsaturation. The 18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> contained higier levels of the unsaturated TGs, namely the diene, triene and tetraene TGs, and lower levels of the saturated TGs {{and to a lesser extent}} the monoene TGs. The diene TGs of the 18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> included combinations of 18 : 2 with two saturated FAs, which are a minor constituent of normal <b>milk</b> <b>fats.</b> Likewise the triene TGs reflected the presence of 18 : 2 in combination with 18 : 1 and a saturated FA. The thermal properties of the two <b>milk</b> <b>fats</b> were examined to investigate the influence of the altered TG composition and structure on the physical characteristics of the <b>milk</b> <b>fat.</b> The 18 : 2 -rich <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> melted at a lower temperature than the control <b>milk</b> <b>fat</b> with a large proportion of the sample melting over the narrow temperature range between 5 and 15 °C.

Proper feeding management of dairy herds can both improve {{the economy of}} production and provide a healthier cow.
