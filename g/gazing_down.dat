5|$|Until the 1980s, {{the most}} {{reproduced}} and publicized of Bauer's works were two paintings depicting the princess and the moose from Sagan om älgtjuren Skutt och lilla prinsessan Tuvstarr (The Tale of the Moose Hop and the Little Princess Cotton Grass), published in 1913. The first picture {{is of the}} princess riding on the moose {{and the second is}} of the moose standing guard over the sleeping princess. They were mainly used as pictures on the wall in nurseries. The same tale also contains the picture of Tuvstarr <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> into the tarn looking for her lost heart, an allegory of innocence lost. Bauer made several studies of this motif. During the 1980s the painting of Tuvstarr and the tarn was used in advertising for a shampoo. This started a debate in Sweden about how works of art, considered part of the national heritage, should be used. In 1999, the picture again appeared in advertising, this time in a manipulated version in which all the trees had been cut down and Tuvstarr seemed to be lamenting them. The award-winning advertising campaign was made by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and helped further the newly awakened environmental movement in Sweden. In his biography on Bauer, Gunnar Lindqvist argues that the picture has become too commercialized.|$|E

500|$|In 1994 in the UK, the (Sara Lee) Wonderbra {{achieved}} {{a high profile}} for its racy Hello Boys campaign. The most famous campaign poster presented model Eva Herzigová in a Wonderbra <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> at her breasts with the caption [...] "Hello Boys", ambiguously addressing either male admirers or her breasts. Urban myth attributed a number of car accidents to (male) drivers being distracted by the advertisements. The influential poster was featured in an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and it was voted in at number 10 in a [...] "Poster of the Century" [...] contest.|$|E

2500|$|In the episode's {{emotional}} last moments, Jeff {{has returned}} to the Miller farmhouse and waits anxiously on the doorstep with his mother and grandfather for Lassie to join him.

[...] "She's mine now, isn't she, Gramps?" [...] Jeff cries joyously to his grandfather. [...] "Yes, she's all yours," [...] Gramps replies, [...] "She done her deciding." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unger’s {{subsequent}} {{solo exhibition}} at the Trans Hudson Gallery in 1997 featured five sculptures that display her strong interest in organic forms. [...] Shanks consists of three nine-foot vertical bony shafts, each with a rounded point {{on the floor and}} topped with a bulbous knob. [...] Two knobs, imitating the ball of a ball-and-socket joint, protrude just above the middle of each shaft. [...] The white hydrocal was roughly scarred to give the appearance of bone. [...] One critic got the impression that the sculpture was the leg bone of some huge prehistoric animal. [...] Another believed the sculptures were like stern goddesses <b>gazing</b> <b>down</b> on their followers. [...] The sculpture exemplified Unger’s inclinations – rational yet connected to nature, serene but passionate, rigorously formed yet playful. [...] Unger also included a wall-mounted sculpture titled Black Heart, a darkly poetic version of a heart that hovers without apparent support. [...] Its black scorched and pitted surface looks like damaged skin over muscle. [...] Its mythic presence is in line with the symbolism of the origin of emotion. [...] It suggests that life processes are just as metaphysical as they are scientific.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ridge of}} the Mount Tom Range was formed 200 {{million years ago}} during the late Triassic and early Jurassic periods and is {{composed}} of traprock, also known as basalt, an extrusive volcanic rock. Basalt is a dark colored rock, but the iron within it weathers to a rusty brown when exposed to the air, lending the ledges a distinct reddish appearance. Basalt frequently breaks into octagonal and pentagonal columns, creating a unique [...] "postpile" [...] appearance. Huge slopes made of fractured basalt talus are visible beneath many of the ledges; they are particularly noticeable beneath Mount Tom, Whiting Peak, and Deadtop along the Mount Tom State Reservation park road, or along Metacomet-Monadnock Trail on the summit crest <b>gazing</b> <b>down.</b> The basalt ridges {{are the product of}} several massive lava flows hundreds of feet deep that welled up in faults created by the rifting apart of North America from Eurasia and Africa. These basalt floods of lava happened over a period of 20 million years. [...] Erosion occurring between the eruptions deposited deep layers of sediment between the lava flows, which eventually lithified into sedimentary rock. The resulting [...] "layer cake" [...] of basalt and sedimentary sheets eventually faulted and tilted upward. Subsequent erosion wore away the weaker sedimentary layers faster than the basalt layers, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the basalt sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today. One way to imagine this is to picture a layer cake tilted slightly up with some of the frosting (the sedimentary layer) removed in between.|$|E
