5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} as a testbed for the PlayStation Vita. During development, Studio Liverpool staff sent feedback to Sony regarding aspects of the game that could affect the design of the new console.

5|$|Blonde on Blonde is {{the seventh}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, {{released}} on May 16, 1966, on Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, {{including members of}} Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made <b>it</b> <b>onto</b> the final album—"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.|$|E

5|$|Despite playing {{just one}} game during England's 2010 World Cup {{qualification}} campaign, {{he was named}} in Capello's 30-man preliminary squad for the 2010 World Cup on 11 May 2010. He played 61 minutes of their 3–1 warm-up friendly win over Mexico before being replaced by Tom Huddlestone. On 2 June, Carrick was then named in the final 23-man squad to fly to South Africa for the tournament, before being given the squad number 22. During the World Cup Carrick failed to make <b>it</b> <b>onto</b> the pitch, remaining an unused member of the squad. England were eventually knocked out of the tournament as they lost 4–1 to Germany in their second round tie on 27 June.|$|E
5|$|In 1603, the {{unification}} of the Scottish and English crowns eliminated any residual need for Dunstanburgh Castle as a royal fortress. The following year, King James I sold the castle to Sir Thomas Windebank, Thomas Billott and William Blake, who in turn sold <b>it</b> <b>onto</b> Sir Ralph Grey, a nearby landowner, the following year. Ralph's son, William Lord Grey, was affirmed {{as the owner of}} the castle in 1625.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the MTA filed {{to change}} the {{location}} of Entrance 1, moving <b>it</b> <b>onto</b> from the sidewalk, away from its original proposed location inside 301 East 69th Street. This was because designs for entrances inside the building failed to both satisfy the building's residents as well as meet the MTA's engineering requirements. With the New York City Department of Transportation planning a bike lane along {{the east side of}} Second Avenue after construction is finished, the MTA could widen the sidewalk {{to make room for the}} entrances without ultimately disrupting traffic flow.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the confusion and loss of leadership aboard the American vessel, the British boarding party was being effectively organised. A number of small-arms men rushed aboard Chesapeake, led by Broke, including the purser, Mr G. Aldham, and the clerk, Mr John Dunn. Aldham and Dunn were killed as they crossed the gangway, {{but the rest of}} the party made <b>it</b> <b>onto</b> Chesapeake. Captain Broke, at the head of not more than twenty men, stepped from the rail of the waist-hammock netting onto the muzzle of the after-carronade of Chesapeake, and from there he jumped down to her quarterdeck. As the British boarded there were no American officers left on the quarterdeck to organise resistance.|$|E
5|$|It {{was finally}} {{accepted}} by BBC North in 1986, {{a result of}} a spare budget being assigned for a second series of Happy Families that would never arise, and producer Paul Jackson's insistence that Red Dwarf should be filmed instead. The show was lucky to be remounted after an electricians' strike partway through rehearsals in early 1987 shut the entire production down (the title sequence was filmed in January 1987). The filming was rescheduled for September, and the pilot episode finally made <b>it</b> <b>onto</b> television screens on 15 February 1988.|$|E
5|$|One {{beneficial}} effect of Hurricane Dennis was the rolling {{of the former}} USS Spiegel Grove.

Efforts to roll the ship were partially successful, bringing <b>it</b> <b>onto</b> its starboard side, but Hurricane Dennis completed the roll, bringing Spiegel Grove into its intended upright position.|$|E

During the action the frigates outmanoeuvred the much larger French vessel and drove <b>it</b> <b>onto</b> shore in heavy seas, {{resulting}} in the deaths of between 400 and 1,000 of the 1,300persons aboard. One of the British frigates was also lost in the engagement with six sailors drowned after running onto a sandbank while failing to escape a lee shore.|$|E
5|$|The Calculus Affair {{marked a}} return to the single volume format which was to persist for the rest of The Adventures of Tintin.

With the development of his own Studios Hergé, he selected the best sketch from a number of versions and traced <b>it</b> <b>onto</b> the page he was creating.|$|E
5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} company Rexar reformulated their popular weight loss drug Obetrol following its mandatory {{withdrawal from the}} market in 1973 under the Kefauver Harris Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act due to the results of the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) program (which indicated a lack of efficacy). The new formulation simply replaced the two methamphetamine components with dextroamphetamine and amphetamine components of the same weight (the other two original dextroamphetamine and amphetamine components were preserved), preserved the Obetrol branding, and despite it utterly lacking FDA approval, it still made <b>it</b> <b>onto</b> the market and was marketed and sold by Rexar for a number of years.|$|E
