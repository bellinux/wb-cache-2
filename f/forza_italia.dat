25|$|Italy's {{three major}} {{political}} parties are the Democratic Party, <b>Forza</b> <b>Italia</b> and the Five Star Movement. During the 2013 general election these three parties won 579 out of 630 seats available in the Chamber of Deputies and 294 out of 315 in the Senate. Most of the remaining seats were won by a short-lived electoral bloc formed to support the outgoing Prime Minister Mario Monti, the far left party Left, Ecology, Freedom or by parties that contest elections only {{in one part of}} Italy: the Northern League, the South Tyrolean People's Party, Vallée d'Aoste and Great South. On 15 November 2013, 58 splinter MPs from <b>Forza</b> <b>Italia</b> founded New Centre-Right.|$|E
25|$|While <b>Forza</b> <b>Italia</b> {{had never}} held a formal party {{congress}} to formulate its rules, procedures, and democratic balloting for candidates and issues, (since 1994 three party conventions of <b>Forza</b> <b>Italia</b> have been held, {{all of them}} resolving to support Berlusconi and reelecting him by acclamation) on 27 March 2009, at the foundation congress of the People of Freedom political movement the statute of the new party was subject to a vote of approval.

According to the official minutes of the congress the result favoured Berlusconi, with 100 per cent of the delegates voting for him.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Forza</b> <b>Italia's</b> aim was {{to attract}} {{moderate}} voters who were [...] "disoriented, political orphans and who risked being unrepresented" [...] (as Berlusconi described them), especially if the Democratic Party of the Left (the direct heirs of the Italian Communist Party) {{had been able to}} win the next election and enter in government {{for the first time since}} 1947.|$|R
50|$|It was co-founded by twelve other {{international}} figures.

50|$|Its leading members {{included}} Benedetto Della Vedova (a libertarian {{economist who}} had been leader of the Italian Radicals), Alfredo Biondi (a former Liberal who is currently President of <b>Forza</b> <b>Italia's</b> National Council), Daniele Capezzone (former leader of the Italian Radicals), Andrea Pastore, Giuseppe Calderisi, Marco Taradash, Enrico Musso, Enrico Nan, Mauro Mellini, Arturo Diaconale, Davide Giacalone, Alberto Mingardi, Raimondo Cubeddu, Giordano Bruno Guerri, Filippo Facci, Donato Robilotta, and Ernesto Caccavale.|$|R
25|$|Centrist parties {{such as the}} Union of Christian and Centre Democrats {{immediately}} conceded The Union's victory, {{while other}} parties, like Berlusconi's <b>Forza</b> <b>Italia</b> and the Northern League, refused to accept its validity, right up until 2 May 2006, when Berlusconi submitted his resignation to President Ciampi.|$|E
25|$|Distinguishing {{itself from}} the MSI, the party distanced itself from Benito Mussolini and Fascism and made efforts to improve {{relations}} with Jewish groups. With most hardliners leaving the party, it sought to present itself as a respectable conservative party and to join forces with <b>Forza</b> <b>Italia</b> in the European People's Party and, eventually, in a united party of the centre-right.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the party}} {{approved}} {{the market economy}} and held favourable views on liberalizations and the privatization of state industries, however AN was {{to the left of}} <b>Forza</b> <b>Italia</b> on economic issues and sometimes supported statist policies. That is why the party was strong in Rome and Lazio, where most civil servants live. Moreover, AN presented itself as a party promoting national cohesion, national identity and patriotism.|$|E
50|$|Decide! was {{launched}} in June 2007 by Daniele Capezzone, {{former secretary of the}} Italian Radicals and member of the Chamber of Deputies for the Rose in the Fist, before leaving both. At the beginning the association was affiliated neither to centre-left The Union, from which Capezzone hailed, nor to the centre-right House of Freedoms, but it seemeed definitely closer to the latter. Capezzone himself became closer to <b>Forza</b> <b>Italia's</b> leader Silvio Berlusconi and was harshly critical of Prodi II Cabinet, which he did not support anymore.|$|R
50|$|The Italian Electoral law of 2015, officially Law 6 May 2015, no. 52, colloquially {{known by}} the {{nickname}} Italicum, given to it in 2014 by the Democratic Party secretary and subsequently head of government Matteo Renzi, who was its main proponent (until the end of January 2015 {{with the support of}} <b>Forza</b> <b>Italia's</b> leader Silvio Berlusconi) provides for a two-round system based on party-list proportional representation (the former being ruled out as unconstitutional), corrected by a majority bonus and a 3% election threshold. Candidates run for election in 100 multi-member constituencies with open lists, except for a single candidate chosen by each party who is the first to be elected.|$|R
50|$|Christian {{democrats and}} liberal-centrists were {{undoubtedly}} the strongest factions within the party, but all four were mainstream {{for a special}} issue: for example liberals and liberal-centrists were highly influential over economic policy, Christian democrats led the party over ethical issues (although there was a substantial minority promoting a more progressive outlook), while social democrats had their say in defining the party's policy over labour market reform and, moreover, it is thanks to this group (and to those around Tremonti, he himself a former Socialist) that constitutional reform {{was at the top}} of <b>Forza</b> <b>Italia's</b> political agenda. It is difficult to say to what faction Berlusconi was closer, what is sure is that his political record was a synthesis of all the political tendencies within the party.|$|R
