Along with Laurence Olivier, Schell is considered [...] "one of the greatest Hamlets ever," [...] according to some. Schell recalled that when he played Hamlet for the first time, [...] "it was like {{falling in love with}} a woman.... not until I acted the part of Hamlet did I have a moment when <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> love with acting." [...] Schell's performance of Hamlet was featured as one of the last episodes of the American comedy series Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1999.|$|E

60|$|RANKIN. Excuse my delay, Captain Kearney. The leddy sent me on an errand. (Kearney grunts.) I thought I {{should be}} late. But {{the first thing}} I heard when I arrived was your officer giving your {{compliments}} to Leddy Ceecily, and would she kindly allow the prisoners to come in, as you were anxious to see her again.

60|$|We held {{on through}} the maze, past trench-sweepers of a handy light pattern, with their screw-tailed charge all ready; and a grave or so; and when I came on men who merely stood within easy reach of their rifles, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the second line.

6000|$|The {{dying man}} feebly waved a deprecation with his maimed hand, and even smiled faintly. [...] "I knew you'd say that. I knew what you'd think about it, but it's {{all the same}} now.

60|$|History {{had been}} {{thrust into the}} background. I was never more aware of this than when, shortly after dawn Wednesday, the massive grey pile of the Palace of Versailles {{suddenly}} rose before me. As the motor shot through the empty Place d'Armes I made {{a desperate attempt to}} summon again a vivid impression, when I had first stood there many years ago, of an angry Paris mob beating against that grill, of the Swiss guards dying on the stairway for their Queen. But it was no use. France has undergone some subtle change, yet <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> France. I knew it when we left Paris and sped through the dim leafy tunnels of the Bois; when I beheld a touch of filtered sunlight on the dense blue thatch of the 'marroniers' behind the walls of a vast estate once dedicated to the sports and pleasures of Kings; when I caught glimpses of silent chateaux mirrored in still waters.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is a nice}} kettle of fish, Malcolm, {{about young}} Leslie. I have had the justices down here, asking me all sorts of questions, and they have got into their minds that I taught him not only swordplay but treason, {{and they have been}} {{threatening}} to put me in the stocks as a vagabond; but I snapped my fingers in their faces, saying I earned my money as honestly as they did, and that I concern myself in no way in politics, but teach English officers and the sons of Glasgow tradesmen {{as well as those of}} Highland gentlemen. They were nicely put out, I can tell you; but I didn't care for that, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the right of it. But what on earth made the young cock meddle in this matter? How came he to be mixed up in a Jacobite plot? Have you got your finger in it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{recollection}} of {{about three days}} and nights succeeding this is very dim in my mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but few thoughts framed, and no actions performed. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a small room and in a narrow bed. To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from {{it would have been}} almost to kill me. I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change from morning to noon, from noon to evening. I observed when any one entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible. Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor. Her coming disturbed me. I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me. Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day. They would whisper sentences of this sort at my bedside-- ...|$|E
60|$|There I {{stood alone}} and unarmed, in {{the centre of}} six {{athletic}} men--for Lowiny {{had been sent to}} assemble her brothers, a business in which she was aided by Prudence's blowing a peculiar sort of blast on her conch--and as unable to resist as a child {{would have been in the}} hands of its parent. As a fruitless scuffle would have been degrading, as well as useless, I at once determined to submit, temporarily at least, or so long as submission did not infer disgrace, and was better than resistance. There did not seem to be any immediate disposition to lay violent hands on me, however, and there I stood, a minute or two, after I had missed Sureflint, surrounded by the whole brood of the squatter, young and old, male and female; some looking defiance, others troubled, and all anxious. As for myself, I will frankly own my sensations were far from pleasant; for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the hands of the Philistines, in the depths of a forest, fully twenty miles from any settlement, and with no friends nearer than the party of the Chainbearer, who was at least two leagues distant, and altogether ignorant of my position as well as of my necessities. A ray of hope, however, gleamed in upon me through the probable agency of the Onondago.|$|E
6000|$|And I {{believe that}} having {{anything}} {{on my mind}} puts me in wilder spirits, apparently, than usual, but I am sure that my merriment to-day was no proof that I was happy. It was partly, I believe, from a mad spirit, like what drives wicked men to drinking, and partly from folly and levity. It was the same when Mamma's sister, Miss Dorothea Hazleby, died; I am sure I was very sorry for Aunt Dorothy, for she was a most amiable person, and had always been particularly kind to me, and I was very sorry too for Mamma and old Mrs. Hazleby, who were broken-hearted about it; yet would you believe it? the very day that Papa was gone to Hastings, to the funeral, and Mamma was at home, too ill and too wretched to go, even to her mother, I {{was out in the}} garden with Horace and Dora, forgot all about her distress, and began a noisy game with them close under her window. She sent Kate to tell them not to make such a noise; and when we came in, and she found that it was my doing, she gave me such a kind, grieved, reproachful look, that I think I shall never forget it. And now it is most strange to think how wildly and merrily I laughed at all Rupert's jokes, when <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> disgrace, and after having behaved so very ill.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I--I--I--no--no. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very foolish--ungrateful. But I do hate you,' he said, with {{a sudden}} impulse, 'and I'll tell you why.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't trust me, dear, don't trust what I say," [...] poor Miss Frost ejaculated hurriedly, even wildly. [...] "Don't {{notice what}} I have said. Act for {{yourself}}, dear. Act for yourself entirely. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure <b>I</b> <b>am</b> wrong {{in trying to}} influence you. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> wrong. It is wrong and foolish of me.

6000|$|... . I WAS {{over last}} night, {{contrary}} {{to my own}} wish, in Leven, Fife; and this morning I had a conversation of which, I think, some account might interest you. I was up with a cousin who was fishing in a mill-lade, and a shower of rain drove me for shelter into a tumbledown steading attached to the mill. There I found a labourer cleaning a byre, with whom I fell into talk. The man was to all appearance as heavy, as HEBETE, as any English clodhopper; but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Scotland, and launched out forthright into Education and Politics and the aims of one's life. I told him how I had found the peasantry in Suffolk, and added that their state had made me feel quite pained and down-hearted. 'It but to do that,' he said, 'to onybody that thinks at a'!' Then, again, {{he said that he}} could not conceive how anything could daunt or cast down a man who had an aim in life. 'They that have had a guid schoolin' and do nae mair, whatever they do, they have done; but him that has aye something ayont need never be weary.' I have had to mutilate the dialect much, so that it might be comprehensible to you; but I think the sentiment will keep, even through a change of words, something of the heartsome ring of encouragement that it had for me: and that from a man cleaning a byre! You see what John Knox and his schools have done.|$|E

6000|$|THURSDAY. - I {{suppose there}} must be a cycle in the fatigue of travelling, for when I awoke next morning, I was entirely renewed in spirits and ate a hearty breakfast of porridge, with sweet milk, and coffee and hot cakes, at Burlington upon the Mississippi. [...] Another long day's ride followed, with but one feature worthy of remark. At a place called Creston, a drunken man got in. He was aggressively friendly, but, {{according}} to English notions, not at all unpresentable upon a train. For one stage he eluded the notice of the officials; but just as we were beginning {{to move out of the}} next station, Cromwell by name, by came the conductor. There was a word or two of talk; and then the official had the man by the shoulders, twitched him from his seat, marched him through the car, and sent him flying on to the track. It was done in three motions, as exact as a piece of drill. The train was still moving slowly, although beginning to mend her pace, and the drunkard got his feet without a fall. He carried a red bundle, though not so red as his cheeks; and he shook this menacingly in the air with one hand, while the other stole behind him to the region of the kidneys. It was the first indication that I had come among revolvers, and I observed it with some emotion. The conductor stood on the steps with one hand on his hip, looking back at him; and perhaps this attitude imposed upon the creature, for he turned without further ado, and went off staggering along the track towards Cromwell followed by a peal of laughter from the cars. They were speaking English all about me, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a foreign land.|$|E
