5|$|At Briton Ferry, {{the canal}} ends under the M4 {{motorway}} at a scrapyard, {{but there are}} plans to refurbish Brunel's Briton Ferry dock, just to the south, and a short extension to it would provide a good terminus.

5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E
5|$|Fowles's {{presentation}} of Sarah, {{one of the}} most enigmatic female characters in literary history, is also psychoanalytically informed. Fowles himself was interested in the psychology of men and women.The enigma of femininity, myth of masculinity, and impossibility of man-woman relationship are some of the crucial themes. Through Sarah's deliberate spreading of lies about herself and her relationship with Charles, Fowles brilliantly brings about the various aspects of femininity that <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> authenticate, threaten, and expose the vanity of the male subjects.|$|E

5|$|MOX fuel {{improves}} total burnup. A {{fuel rod}} is reprocessed {{after three years}} of use to remove waste products, which by then account for 3% of the total weight of the rods. Any uranium or plutonium isotopes produced during those three years are left and the rod goes back into production. The presence of up to 1% gallium per mass in weapons-grade plutonium alloy <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> interfere with long-term operation of a light water reactor.|$|E

Southern Electric runs the local electricity distribution network, while SGN runs the gas distribution network.

5|$|The {{main effect}} of humans on this species is indirect, through {{woodland}} clearance which affects the habitat, predation by cats, and collisions with windows, buildings and cars.

Weizenbaum was {{disturbed}} that Colby saw his mindless program as a serious therapeutic tool. A feud began, and the situation was not helped when Colby did not credit Weizenbaum for his contribution to the program. In 1976, Weizenbaum published Computer Power and Human Reason which argued that the misuse of artificial intelligence <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> devalue human life.|$|E

It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|A galactic bar also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> {{affect the}} size of the galactic {{habitable}} zone. Galactic bars are thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there. High-metallicity stars like our Sun, for example, located at an intermediate location between the low-metallicity galactic halo and the high-radiation galactic center, may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting the definition of the galactic habitable zone. It has been suggested that for this reason, it may be impossible to properly define a galactic habitable zone.|$|E
