40|$|Natural Ca-targets were bombarbarded with 7. 7 MeV deutereons. Magnetic {{analysis}} was used to obtain [alpha]-particle spectra at angles of 50 [deg], 70 [deg] and 90 [deg]. About 35 levels in K 38 were found up to an excitation energy of 4. 8 MeV. There are the following low-lying states: (Eexc, J[pi], T) = (0. 00 MeV, 3 +, 0); (0. 12 MeV, 0 +, 1); (0. 43 MeV, 1 +, 0); (1. 69 MeV, 1 +, 0); (2. 41 MeV, 2 +, 1). They are in agreement with recent intermediate coupling shell model calculations. Most of the levels above 2. 5 MeV result from configurations with one or more nucleons raised into the shell. The nuclear temperature derived from an Ericson plot is 1. 05 +/- 0. 15 MeV. Angular distributions for the low excited states were measured from 10 [deg] to 165 [deg]. The angular distributions and the total cross section show the effect of the [Delta]T = 0 <b>isobaric</b> <b>spin</b> selection rule which inhibits direct interaction leading to T = 1 final states. Compound nucleus transitions to the T = 1 states take place, however, because of <b>isobaric</b> <b>spin</b> mixing in the intermediate nucleus, and the selection rule seems to be completely violated. The total cross sections are in agreement with the theory of Hauser and Feshbach. This theory also makes it possible to estimate the compound nucleus contributions for the transitions leading to T = 0 states. About of the total cross section for these transitions are due to direct interaction, which produces a pronounced structure of the angular distributions in the forward and backward hemisphere. The significance of this structure in terms of the various direct interaction modes is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Capture {{reactions}} will {{be considered}} here {{from the viewpoint of}} the nuclear spectroscopist. Especially important to him are the capture of neutrons, protons, and alpha particles, which may proceed through narrow resonances, offering a well defined initial state for the subsequent deexcitation process. Each of these particles mentioned above has its own advantages and disadvantages, largely depending on particle energy and on the mass number region in which one is going to work. The γ-radiation produced at a resonance may be investigated through measurements of the γ-ray spectrum and its angular distribution, and through coincidence and angular correlation measurements. The theory is well established, and has been fully supported by experiment in a large number of cases. Complications in the interpretation may arise from interference between different resonances (if these are broad), and from mixing of different channel spins, of different orbital momenta of the incoming particle, and of different γ-ray multipolarities. Very fruitful have proved (p, γ) reactions on light elements. They offer an almost ideal opportunity for spin and parity determinations of resonance levels and lower levels.

40|$|Background: Single-reference density {{functional}} {{theory is}} {{very successful in}} reproducing bulk nuclear properties like binding energies, radii, or quadrupole moments throughout the entire periodic table. Its extension to the multireference level allows for restoring symmetries and, in turn, for calculating transition rates. Purpose: We propose a new variant of the no-core-configuration-interaction (NCCI) model treating properly isospin and rotational symmetries. The model is applicable to any nucleus irrespective of its mass and neutronand proton-number parity. It properly includes polarization effects caused by an interplay between the long- and short-range forces acting in the atomic nucleus. Methods: The method is based on solving the Hill-Wheeler-Griffin equation within a model space built of linearly dependent states having good angular momentum and properly treated <b>isobaric</b> <b>spin.</b> The states are generated {{by means of the}} isospin and angular-momentum projection applied to a set of low-lying (multi) particle-(multi) hole deformed Slater determinants calculated using the self-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach. Results: The theory is applied to calculate energy spectra in N ≈ Z nuclei that are relevant {{from the point of view}} of a study of superallowed Fermi β decays. In particular, a new set of the isospin-symmetry-breaking corrections to these decays is given. Conclusions: It is demonstrated that the NCCI model is capable of capturing main features of low-lying energy spectra in light and medium-mass nuclei using relatively small model space and without any local readjustment of its low-energy coupling constants. Its flexibility and a range of applicability makes it an interesting alternative to the conventional nuclear shell model...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurements}} {{described in}} the preceding paper (I) are used to obtain the position, spin and <b>isobaric</b> <b>spin</b> of energy levels in 26 Al. All the observed intensive high-energy γ-rays can be explained as transitions from resonance levels to the levels found by Browne 7) from the 28 Si(d, a) 26 Al reaction and to one additional level at Ex = 2. 57 ± 0. 04 MeV. The low-energy γ-rays fit the same level scheme, plus one more additional level at Ex = 0. 235 ± 0. 009 MeV. The latter level is actually the first excited state in 26 Al, {{which turns out to}} be an isomeric state decaying by β+ emission with the long known half life of 6. 6 sec. Spins J, parities and isobaric spins T can be assigned as follows: Ex = 0 (J = 5 +, T = 0), Ex = 0. 235 MeV (J = 0 +, T = 1), Ex = 0. 419 MeV (J = 3 +, T = 0), Ex = 1. 055 MeV (J = 1 +, T = 0), Ex = 1. 750 MeV (J = 2 +, T = 0), Ex = 2. 064 MeV (J = 2 +, T = 0). The resonance level at Ex = 6. 73 MeV has J = 4 −, T = 0. Tentative assignments to the other resonance levels will be discussed. The 6. 6 sec β+ decay is remarkable by being one of the few known 0 + → 0 + transitions. The β+ endpoint can best be arrived at by using a cycle involving the 0. 820 MeV γ-ray from 25 Mg(p, γ) 26 Al, the Q-value of the 28 Si(d, a) 26 Al transition to the 1. 055 MeV level in 26 Al, and a reevaluation of the 28 Si- 26 Mg mass difference. This yields Eβ+ = 3. 225 ± 0. 015 MeV, and ft = 3200 ± 80 sec. The ft value of this β+ transition can now be used for direct evaluation of the Fermi coupling constant gF.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityEnergy {{levels are}} {{characterized}} by the following properties: excitation energy, Q, angular momentum, parity, level width, <b>isobaric</b> <b>spin,</b> magnetic moment and configuration. They may be studied experimentally by the following methods: (1) measurement of the energy spectra of nuclear reaction products, (2) measurement of peaks in the yield curve {{as a function of}} incident particle energy to obtain levels in the compound nucleus, (3) measurement of gamma ray intensity as a function of bombarding particle energy, (4) measurement of the maximum beta decay energy to locate levels in the residual nucleus, (5) measurement of input particle energy thresholds for production of neutrons, (6) measurement of angular distributions and angular correlations to find the spin and parity of a level. The accurate measurement of neutron spectra is difficult because the uncharged neutron must be detected by indirect means. Cloud chambers, proportional counters, threshold detectors, time-of-flight methods, and nuclear emulsions have all been used successfully. Nuclear emulsions detect neutrons by the track of developable silver halide crystals left by a recoil proton after being struck by a neutron. The range of the recoil proton and the angle it made with the incident neutron beam are measured. Knowledge of the range-energy curve for the emulsion and application of the laws of conservation of energy and momentum determines the energy of the incident neutron. The emulsion consists of a high concentration of silver halide crystals embedded in gelatin. The following is a description of the nuclear emulsion method: A beam of particles strikes a target, neutrons are emitted, and they are detected by plates placed at several different angles with respect to the incident beam. Development of the plates must be done soon after exposure, since the latent image fades rapidly. In this experiment, a combination of the two-solution and low temperature development techniques was used. The plates are scanned with a microscope and the following quantities are measured: (1) θ, the dip angle in the processed emulsion, (2) l, the projection in the x-y plane of the track length in the processed emulsion, and (3) φ the angle l makes with the x axis. φ and θ are measured {{at the beginning of the}} track. To avoid large errors, only tracks which fall within certain acceptance criteria are measured. This experiment required the following criteria to be satisfied: (1) if φ≤ 10 °, tan θ≤ 0. 075, (2) if 10 ° 15 ° it is not accepted, and (4) the track must lie wholly within the emulsion. Scanning is done in strips one field of view wide and about half the plate length long. At each x and y coordinate setting the entire depth of the emulsion is searched for tracks, then the x coordinate is changed by about half a field of view, and the process is repeated. Strips are separated by two or three fields of view so that overlapping does not occur. Length measurements are made in eyepiece scale divisions, which must be converted to microns by calibrating against a stage micrometer. The emulsion thickness must be measured daily since it varies with humidity. Neutron energies are calculated by converting the measured track length to length in the unprocessed emulsion, and then applying conservation of energy and momentum. The number of tracks obtained per energy interval as a function of energy is tabulated. Two corrections are needed because: (1) the neutron-proton scattering cross section is strongly energy dependent, and (2) the probability of the recoil proton escaping from the emulsion increases with energy. Results are plotted in histogram form. The Q value for each neutron group is calculated; the highest neutron energy group usually represents formation of the ground state, the next highest represents the first excited state, etc. The energy resolution of the nuclear emulsion method is limited by the following factors: (1) Range straggling of protons in the emulsion, (2) energy straggling of the beam in the target, (3) energy spread of the beam, (4) multiple scattering of the protons in the emulsion, (5) length and angle measurement errors, (6) finite target size and angular spread of neutrons incident on the emulsion. This experiment was performed to measure the mass of p^ 28, by means of the reaction Si^ 28 (p,n) p^ 28. The target, a suspension of natural silicon in polystyrene, was bombarded by protons from the Princeton cyclotron, with an energy of 17. 45 ± 0. 15 Mev. The target thickness corresponded to an energy loss of 100 kev for 17 Mev protons, so the average proton energy reaching the plates was 17. 4 ± 0. 2 Mev. Ilford C- 2 plates, 400 microns thick, were placed 4. 5 in. from the target in an evacuated scattering chamber. Plates were mounted at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 degrees. At each angle two plates were sandwiched together, emulsions facing, and wrapped in aluminun 1 and lead foils. The beam was collimated by graphite apertures and was stopped by a graphite cup, relatively far from the plates. Plates were scanned at 30, 60, and 90 degrees. The range-energy relation of Rotblat was used. Data was corrected for n-p scattering and geometry. Five hundred tracks were measured at 30 ° and 90 °, and 250 tracks at 60 °. The ground state of p^ 28 was resolved only at 30 °, and actually the peak found in the 30 ° spectrum is probably due to both the ground and first excited states in p^ 28. Q for the ground state is - 14. 71 ± 0. 22 Mev; the mass defect of p^ 28 is 0. 68 ± 0. 22 Mev; the mass of p^ 28 is 28. 00073 ± 0. 00024 amu. The differential cross section at 30 ° for formation of the ground and first excited states of p^ 28 is 0. 27 ±. 018 mb/steradian. If one corrects for the Coulomb energy difference and the neutron-proton mass difference, the mass of p^ 28 is 9. 39 Mev greater than that of Si^ 28. This means that the ground state of p^ 28 probably corresponds to the lower of two levels in Si^ 28, located at about 9. 39 Mev. This is in excellent agreement with the hypothesis of charge independence of nuclear forces. The reactions Si^ 29 (p,n) p^ 29 and Si^ 30 (p,n) p^ 30 were observed. No new levels were found in either p^ 29 or p^ 30...|$|E
