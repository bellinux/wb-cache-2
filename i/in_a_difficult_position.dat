5|$|The French {{followed}} after Kutuzov, {{but soon}} found themselves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> Prussian intentions were unknown {{and could be}} hostile, the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French lines of communication were extremely long, requiring strong garrisons to keep them open. Napoleon realized that {{to capitalize on the}} success at Ulm, he had to force the Allies to battle and defeat them.|$|E
5|$|At 1.15 pm, Parker {{was waiting}} outside the harbour with the reserve {{and raised a}} signal {{ordering}} Nelson to withdraw. Nelson acknowledged the signal but ignored it, while Nelson's second in command, Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves, repeated the signal but too did not obey it. Riou now found himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> Too junior an officer to risk disobeying a direct order, he remained in action for a further {{half an hour before}} reluctantly giving the order for his small squadron to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Like other Spanish liberals, Goya {{was left}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position</b> after the French invasion. He had {{supported}} the initial {{aims of the}} French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.|$|E

50|$|In several episodes, Southerlyn {{is portrayed}} as {{opposing}} the death penalty, which often puts her <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> ethical <b>position</b> when working with McCoy and Branch, who both support capital punishment.|$|R
5|$|The Dallachy Wing was {{on alert}} to attack any ships {{found by the}} {{reconnaissance}} patrol. Although the group of five merchant ships were highly vulnerable to attack and a worthwhile target, Coastal Command came under the operational command of the Admiralty and was bound by its decision to give higher priority to attacking warships than merchant vessels. As a result, the wing was dispatched against Z33 even though the destroyer and its escorts were well protected and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position</b> for aircraft to attack.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking part}} in a tour of Jamaica by the Yorkshire team, on which he scored 115 and 75 in {{successive}} games, Leyland scored 1,790 runs at 45.89 in 1936. He hit seven centuries, including an innings of 263 runs against Essex in the season, the highest first-class score of his career. He played in two of the three Tests against India that season—he missed the second with injury—but only batted twice. In the first Test, he scored 60 runs against a strong bowling attack when England were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> The home side won the series 2–0. During the season, Leyland was among the first players chosen to tour Australia with the MCC in the forthcoming winter.|$|E
5|$|Greece emerged victorious {{after the}} 1912-1913 Balkan Wars, with her {{territory}} almost doubled. The unstable international political {{climate of the}} early 20th century placed Greece <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> The ownership of the Greek occupied eastern Aegean islands was contested by the Ottoman Empire which claimed them as their own. In the north, Bulgaria, defeated in the Second Balkan War, was engineering revanchist strategies against Greece and Serbia. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. This caused Germany and Austria-Hungary, and countries allied with Serbia (the Triple Entente) to declare war on each other, starting World War I.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, {{pledging}} {{its commitment}} to women's education, the university bought the financially struggling Hartford College for Women (HCW). Since the university itself was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> financial <b>position,</b> several years later HCW was closed.|$|R

5|$|In February 1956 Khrushchev denounced Stalin's cult of {{personality}} at the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party and {{embarked on a}} reform course. The de-Stalinization of official Soviet ideology left Poland's Stalinist hardliners <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> While unrest and desire for reform and change among both intellectuals and workers was beginning to surface throughout the Eastern Bloc, the death of Stalin's ally Bierut in March 1956 in Moscow (the veteran hardliner chief was attending the Soviet party's congress) exacerbated an existing split in the Polish party. In March Bierut was succeeded by Edward Ochab as first secretary. As the 20th Congress launched also a process of partial democratisation of Polish political and economic life, Ochab engaged in reforms intended to promote industrial decentralization and improve living standards.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to his homeland, Pyrrhus found himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> His Italian sojourn had emptied his coffers and {{crippled}} his army, leaving him reliant on Sicilian mercenaries who required payment. In order to secure funds to pay his troops, Pyrrhus planned a war against Antigonus II Gonatas, the new king of Macedon. Citing Antigonus' refusal to provide him with aid during his Italian expedition as a casus belli, Pyrrhus invaded Macedon {{in the spring of}} 274 BC. He was accompanied by an army consisting of 8,000 infantry and 500 cavalry although their numbers were probably augmented by Gallic mercenaries. It has been speculated that by invading Macedon, Pyrrhus was acting as the agent of the monarchs of Ptolemaic Egypt, Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, however N. G. L. Hammond posits that this is highly unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} concerned {{who should}} invest a new bishop {{with his staff}} and ring: traditionally, this had been {{carried out by the}} king in a symbolic demonstration of royal power, but Pope Urban II had condemned this practice in 1099, arguing that only the papacy could carry out this task, and declaring that the clergy should not give homage to their local temporal rulers. Anselm returned to England from exile in 1100 having heard Urban's pronouncement, and informed Henry that he would be complying with the Pope's wishes. Henry was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> On one hand, the symbolism and homage was important to him; on the other hand, he needed Anselm's support in his struggle with his brother Duke Robert.|$|E
5000|$|The French {{received}} {{scores of}} Fox slaves {{during the previous}} four years, placing themselves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> diplomatic <b>position</b> between their allies and the Fox. By accepting these slaves, French colonists had symbolically acknowledged their enmity against the Fox, implicitly committing military support to their allies in future disputes.|$|R

The high quality of Güssefeld's work is credited with saving Homann Heirs, a formerly famous publisher which before Güssefeld's arrival had been <b>in</b> <b>an</b> increasingly <b>difficult</b> <b>position</b> due to mismanagement.|$|R
5|$|One of Mary's first {{actions as}} queen was {{to order the}} release of the Roman Catholic Duke of Norfolk and Stephen Gardiner from {{imprisonment}} in the Tower of London, as well as her kinsman Edward Courtenay. Mary understood that the young Lady Jane was essentially a pawn in Dudley's scheme, and Dudley was the only conspirator of rank executed for high treason {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the coup. Lady Jane and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, though found guilty, were kept under guard in the Tower rather than immediately executed, while Lady Jane's father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, was released. Mary was left <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position,</b> as almost all the Privy Counsellors had been implicated in the plot to put Lady Jane on the throne. She appointed Gardiner to the council and made him both Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor, offices he held until his death in November 1555. Susan Clarencieux became Mistress of the Robes. On 1 October 1553, Gardiner crowned Mary at Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli {{was ordained}} in Constance, {{the seat of}} the local diocese, and he celebrated his first Mass in his hometown, Wildhaus, on 29 September 1506. As a young priest he had studied little theology, but this was not {{considered}} unusual at the time. His first ecclesiastical post was the pastorate of the town of Glarus, where he stayed for ten years. It was in Glarus, whose soldiers were used as mercenaries in Europe, that Zwingli became involved in politics. The Swiss Confederation was embroiled in various campaigns with its neighbours: the French, the Habsburgs, and the Papal States. Zwingli placed himself solidly {{on the side of the}} Roman See. In return, Pope Julius II honoured Zwingli by providing him with an annual pension. He took the role of chaplain in several campaigns in Italy, including the Battle of Novara in 1513. However, the decisive defeat of the Swiss in the Battle of Marignano caused a shift in mood in Glarus in favour of the French rather than the pope. Zwingli, the papal partisan, found himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position</b> and he decided to retreat to Einsiedeln in the canton of Schwyz. By this time, he had become convinced that mercenary service was immoral and that Swiss unity was indispensable for any future achievements. Some of his earliest extant writings, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), attacked the mercenary system using allegory and satire. His countrymen were presented as virtuous people within a French, imperial, and papal triangle. Zwingli stayed in Einsiedeln for two years during which he withdrew completely from politics in favour of ecclesiastical activities and personal studies.|$|E
25|$|The town's {{teachers}} were also placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> They {{were forced to}} swear loyalty to Faubus's bills. Even though Faubus's idea of private schools never played out, the {{teachers were}} still expected to attend school every day and prepare {{for the possibility of}} their students' return. The teachers were completely under Faubus's control and the many months that the school stayed empty only served as a cause for uncertainty in their professional futures.|$|E
50|$|Game 6 {{was another}} win for Anand. Anand played <b>a</b> novelty <b>in</b> the Nimzo-Indian (9 h3). Kramnik, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{somewhat}} <b>difficult</b> <b>position,</b> sacrificed <b>a</b> pawn with 18...c5?!, {{but it did}} not work and he was a pawn down for little compensation. Anand then converted the pawn advantage into a win.|$|R
50|$|Just like in {{the second}} tiebreak game, Kramnik {{displayed}} his skill in positions where the queens have been exchanged. Topalov's small inaccuracy on move 20 was punished by a precise sequence of moves from Kramnik, which eventually won him <b>a</b> pawn. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>position,</b> Topalov made one final blunder, and the match was over.|$|R

25|$|Bellarmine {{found no}} problem with heliocentrism {{so long as it}} was treated as a purely {{hypothetical}} calculating device and not as a physically real phenomenon, but he did not regard it as permissible to advocate the latter unless it could be conclusively proved through current scientific standards. This put Galileo <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position,</b> because he believed that the available evidence strongly favoured heliocentrism, and he wished to be able to publish his arguments.|$|E
25|$|The {{alliance}} with Labour had put Forrest <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position,</b> {{as he had}} repeatedly opposed it. Before the December 1906 federal election, he continued to attack the Labour Party despite sharing government with it and depending on its support. In the following months, Forrest was himself heavily criticised in the press for his willingness {{to work with the}} Labour Party when Cabinet was in session and for his attacks on the party during election campaigns.|$|E
25|$|Mozart died in 1791, leaving {{debts and}} placing Constanze <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> At this point Constanze's {{business}} skills came into fruition: she obtained a pension from the emperor, organized profitable memorial concerts, and {{embarked on a}} campaign to publish the works of her husband. These efforts gradually made Constanze financially secure and ultimately, wealthy. She sent Karl and Franz to Prague to be educated by Franz Xaver Niemetschek, with whom she collaborated on the first full-length biography of Mozart.|$|E
60|$|He was {{so anxious}} to proceed {{that he would have}} made no excuse, {{although}} he saw that he might find himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> Pete's insistence, therefore, on taking all expenses upon himself, was a considerable relief to him; for although determined to go, he had had an uneasy consciousness that it was a foolish step. He therefore expressed his warm thanks.|$|R
25|$|After the 2012 {{regional}} election resulted in Convergence and Union (CiU) unexpectedly losing seats, President Mas was placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> political <b>position,</b> {{as he fell}} 18 seats short of the absolute majority. He was forced to sign an agreement with Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), in which the latter pledged to support the government, albeit without entering <b>a</b> formal coalition, <b>in</b> return for <b>a</b> faster process to obtain the independence of Catalonia.|$|R
25|$|WEVD {{found itself}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> {{financial}} <b>position</b> {{that was a}} veritable Catch-22 — unions and other left wing institutions were difficult to motivate to make donations due to the station's limited broadcast time and poor signal coverage, but without these donations {{it would be impossible}} to improve the transmission situation which would make the donations happen. To make up the financial shortfall the station became aggressive in pushing for contributions from its listeners.|$|R
25|$|Fighting many wars with Ottoman Empire {{could not}} stop the Turkish side to grow and take more land in east, west and south. Sigismund found himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> He already took a loan from Polish king when signing the Treaty of Lubovla but the royal coffers were empty since he used every penny {{in the war against}} rebellious Venice. Since he could not pay back the loan given by Polish king, he lost 16 towns in Spiš area to Polish side.|$|E
25|$|The Bogd Khaanate was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> On the one hand, {{it lacked}} the {{strength}} to repel a pan-Mongolist attack; on the other, they were profoundly disquieted {{by the thought of}} more Chinese troops in Mongolia. The first detachment of Chinese troops arrived to Urga in July 1919. Prince N.A Kudashev, the old Imperial Russian ambassador to Beijing, indicated a violation of the Kyakhta Agreement by China. This step in conflict with the Kyakhta agreement was considered by the Chinese as the first step toward Chinese sovereignty over Mongolia. In any event, the threatened pan-Mongolian invasion never materialized because of dissension between the Buryats and Inner Mongolians, and Semyonov's dream of a pan-Mongolian state died.|$|E
25|$|The Sri Lankans {{having won}} the toss {{and put the}} Indians to bat, had them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>position</b> early when both their openers were out with the total on 44. However, Robin Singh and Rahul Dravid built up a strong {{partnership}} and took their team {{to a total of}} 206 runs, before Dravid was out for 78. Singh had just completed his maiden century when he was dismissed. Azharuddin had become the third batsman to pass 7,000 ODI runs before he was dismissed for 34 with the total on 273. The rest of the batsmen scored low, with the last six wickets being taken by the Sri Lankans in 33 balls while conceding 23 runs. The Indians completed their 50 overs with a score of 291/9.|$|E
