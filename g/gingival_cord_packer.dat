40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of making impression for fixed protheses directly in the mouth, impresions material or negative form resembling the tooth and surrounding structures are used to get a working model. Impression received must be a real replica of a tooth that has been prepared. The impressions that are not clear between the borders with gingival preparation are the common cause of failure when impression was made. Good impression {{is one of the}} supporting factors to produce a fixed protheses which can well adapted to the tooth tissue that does not cause leaks and dissolve the cement. So the tooth is protected from caries and the fixed denture can have a better function, durable and good aesthetic. These problems can be overcome by performing gingival retraction on abutment teeth that have been prepared. Gingival retraction can be done mechanically, chemically on prepared abutment teeth by using <b>gingival</b> <b>cord</b> or paste, and by using electrosurgery...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{impression}} {{techniques used}} in restorative dentistry require displacementof gingival tissue {{to expose the}} subgingival finish lines on the tooth preparation. Many different medications are used on <b>gingival</b> retraction <b>cords</b> {{in order to minimize}} hemorrhage from the gingival sulcus during impression making. A common method of accomplishing gingival displacement is by packing <b>cord</b> into the <b>gingival</b> crevice. This is especially critical when using hydrophobic impression materials such as polyvinyl siloxanes. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether any of the commonly used gingival retraction medications could inhibit the polymerization of polyvinyl siloxane impression materials when they are in direct contact with the setting material and to evaluate the clinical performance of retraction <b>cords.</b> Many <b>gingival</b> retraction <b>cords</b> in various shapes, sizes and medications are available on the market. The literature is replete with reports on the effects of medicated and non-medicated cords on impression and gingival tissue. In this study, the number of the criteria of evaluation was increased and both in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted together by three prosthodontists...|$|R
40|$|This study aims at {{comparing}} {{the appearance of}} the finish line using the observational method, and a new method in taking the impression and displacement of the gingival tissue without the <b>gingival</b> <b>cord.</b> In this research, Twenty one (21) patients were chosen. Who did not suffer from any supportive tissue diseases (such as inflammation or gingival bleeding). The patients needed crowns for their molars. Three impressions were taken from each patient, and the total number of impressions was 63. After preparation, the first impression was handled with the traditional method (putty – wash) without the gingival retraction. The second impression was handled with the observational method. All the final impressions were filled by Acryl, either completely or only for the prepared tooth area. After that, the bases were filled with gypsum. Cochran and McNemar test were used to study the differences among the two groups’ averages. Results have shown that there are statistical differences {{between the first and second}} group. It was concluded that the Traditional Method is better than the other one. Although the observational method is good, the traditional one is much better...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{use of a}} <b>gingival</b> {{displacement}} <b>cord</b> with a <b>gingival</b> displacement {{substance is}} a common procedure for taking a quality impression of the cervical terminal in teeth for prosthetic purposes. Objective To evaluate whether the mechanical-chemical method with 0. 05 % tetryzoline hydrochloride or 25 % aluminum chloride is capable of reducing crevicular fluid, and displacing a statistically significant larger quantity of gingival tissue vertically, compared with the mechanical method (without chemical substances). Material and method Ten patients were selected, and then No. 000 and 1 Ultrapak cords were randomly positioned on teeth 13, 21 and 23. Group I – cord with no chemical substance; Group II – cords impregnated with tetryzoline hydrochloride and Group III – cords impregnated with aluminum chloride. Using dental stone models, thirty images were captured with a camera coupled to a loupe to analyze the degree of gingival displacement. Crevicular fluid was quantified using a high-precision scale and individualized strips of absorbent paper for each tooth on which gingival displacement was performed. Result There was no statistical difference between the three groups relative {{to the amount of}} vertical gingival displacement (Anova, p= 0. 26). As regards reduction in crevicular fluid, {{there was no difference between}} the test and control groups (Wilcoxon and Friedman, p < 0. 05). Conclusion The use of tetryzoline hydrochloride or aluminum chloride to impregnate the <b>gingival</b> displacement <b>cord</b> did not improve the quantity of vertical gingival displacement and did not reduce the amount of crevicular fluid...|$|R
40|$|Soft tissue {{collapse}} around prepared {{teeth and}} pontic is inevitable after {{removal of the}} provisional restoration during the impression taking procedures. When inserting <b>gingival</b> retraction <b>cord,</b> soft tissue is displaced to an undesired contour. Viscosity of impression material also causes gingival displacement. Therefore, the consideration to transfer the prosthetically contoured soft tissue to master cast is required, especially in the esthetic area. In this report, the methods to maintain the soft tissue contour and transfer to the mastercast will be introduced. Harmonious contour of the soft tissue can be achieved with provisional restoration and {{be transferred to the}} master cast with two different techniques mentioned in this case report.

50|$|Communication {{with the}} oral {{environment}} is maintained via {{the opening of}} the periodontal pocket. However, if the opening of a periodontal pocket becomes obstructed, as may occur if the pocket has become very deep (e.g. with furcation involvement), then plaque and calculus are trapped inside. Food packing may also obstruct a periodontal pocket. Food packing is usually caused by failure to accurately reproduce the contact points when dental restorations are placed on the interproximal surfaces of teeth. Another potential cause occurs when a periodontal pocket is scaled incompletely. Following this procedure, the gingival cuff tightens around the tooth, which may be enough to trap the bacteria left in the pocket. A <b>gingival</b> retraction <b>cord</b> which is accidentally left in situ is an occasional cause of a periodontal abscess.|$|R
30|$|Considering the {{restorative}} treatment attitudes for {{the direct}} restorations of NCCLs (Table  3), {{it was observed}} that 86.6 % assumed to use relative isolation. Furthermore, 51.6 % did not use gingival retraction/separation techniques and 34.4 % use hemostatic solution associated with the <b>gingival</b> retraction <b>cord.</b> With regard the restorative materials, 67.7 % stated that uses glass-ionomer cement (GIC) or resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (RMGIC) as liners depending on the cavity depth. The two-step etch and rinse adhesive systems were the most chosen one (61.7 %)—where 82.7 % of the dentists that consider self-etching systems assumed to use of phosphoric acid in enamel—and 56.4 % prefer the use of hybrid/microhybrid resins to restore NCCCLs. Considering restoration longevity based their clinicians experiences, only 8.3 % (28) believe that NCCLs restorations can last for more than 5  years in service.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{investigated}} the possible interactions between three addition silicone materials (Express®, Aquasil Ultra® and Adsil®), three hemostatic agents (ferric sulfate, StatGel FS®; aluminum sulfate, GelCord®; and aluminum chloride, Hemostop®) and <b>gingival</b> retraction <b>cords</b> previously handled with latex gloves to determine whether direct contact with medicaments or indirect contamination by latex in conditions {{similar to those found}} in clinical practice inhibit or affect the setting of the impression materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A portable device for the simultaneous test of several specimens was specifically developed for this study. Polymerization inhibition was analyzed by examination of the impressions and the molded surface. Ten trials were performed for each addition silicone material used in the study, at a total of 240 study samples. RESULTS: All the samples tested (N= 240) were nonreactive regardless of the type of combination used. CONCLUSIONS: Aluminum sulfate, ferric sulfate and aluminum chloride hemostatic solutions did not show any inhibitory potential on the addition silicone samples under study, and there were no changes in polymerization as a result of contact between addition silicone and retraction cords handled with latex gloves...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the cytotoxicity of some recently introduced tissue retraction materials and to compare their cytotoxic effects on the human gingival tissue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One representative brand of the commonly used conventional tissue retraction materials (Gingi-pak) along with two recent types (Expasyl and SnoWhite as a part of PerfectlM systems) were used in this project. A total of 27 specimens were prepared and divided into three groups, nine of each tested material. The cytotoxicity of the tested specimens was judged using the cell viability method along with direct contact test in an especially prepared culture at different time periods. RESULTS: The obtained results showed qualitatively that Gingi-pak material did inhibit the cell growth of the used culture media. On the other hand, Expasyl and SnoWhite (as a part of PerfectlM Systems) materials produced very slight growth inhibition of the cultured cells with some observed detached cell linings. CONCLUSIONS: The conventional <b>gingival</b> retraction <b>cord</b> impregnated with adrenaline; Gingi-pak was the most toxic material among the tested materials at all time periods.

40|$|Objective: To {{measure the}} {{thickness}} of five different brands of <b>gingival</b> retraction <b>cords</b> and verify whether {{there would be a}} relationship among the sizes and their numbers and a coherent increasing from the thinnest to the largest thickness. Material and Methods: the following cords were evaluated: Gengiret(G), Retraflex(RF), Retractor(RT), Ultrapack(UP), and Pro Retract(PR). Pieces of the cords were placed beside a metallic ruler and photographed standardly regarding to the distance and light. The measurements of the thickness were performed through imaging software (Adobe Photoshop CS 6 - Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA). The obtained data were submitted to statistical analysis (one-way ANOVA and post hoc Sheffé test (p = 0. 05)). Results: The number and {{the thickness of}} the cords mismatched for most of the brands evaluated. Two brands (UP and PR) showed a thickness increasing that mismatched the size increasing between the thinnest and largest cord. Conclusion: The number assigned to the cords by the manufactures did not correspond to a standard thickness, so that the dentist must observe the risk of using cords from different brands during gingival retraction procedures during techniques requiring more than one retraction cord...|$|R
40|$|Background: Exposure of the gingival sulcus while {{controlling}} hemorrhage is {{prerequisites for}} maximizing treatment outcomes of cervical carious lesions and for obtaining quality impressions for the fabrication of indirect restorations with cervical finish lines. <b>Gingival</b> retraction <b>cords</b> saturated with different chemical agents {{are widely used}} for this purpose. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate and compare the inflammatory potential of 15. 5 %ferric sulfate on connective tissue when placed at different times. Materials and Methods: All procedures were performed on three dogs under general anesthesia. Retraction cords saturated with a 15. 5 % ferric sulfate solution were placed into the gingival sulcus and evaluated after 3 min and 10 min of exposure to the chemical agent. Excisional biopsies of the exposed gingival tissue were then obtained at intervals of 1 h, 24 h, and 7 days. For all specimens, histology evaluation was performed using light microscopy. Data collected from the microscopic images of all tissue specimens were analyzed by using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank and Kruskal-Wallis Tests. P value less than 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results: Histopathologic examination of the biopsied gingival tissue revealed that the ferric sulfate solution caused significant tissue changes at the beginning of both the 3 -min and 10 -min gingival exposure time (P > 0. 05). However, the tissue returned to a normal histological appearance by the end of day 7 in all cases (P > 0. 05). Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that the biologic effects of 15. 5 % ferric sulfate solution are clinically acceptable and reliable when gingival exposure times of 3 min and 10 min are used for gingival retraction...|$|R
