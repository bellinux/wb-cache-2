25|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} is industrially {{produced as}} a 50% solution by {{variations of the}} <b>electrolytic</b> chloralkali process. <b>Chlorine</b> gas is also produced in this process. Solid sodium hydroxide is obtained from this solution by the evaporation of water. Solid sodium hydroxide is most commonly sold as flakes, prills, and cast blocks.|$|R
50|$|In the mercury-cell process, {{also known}} as the Castner-Kellner process, a {{saturated}} brine solution floats on top of a thin layer of mercury. The mercury is the cathode, where sodium is produced and forms a sodium-mercury amalgam with the mercury. The amalgam is continuously drawn out of the cell and reacted with water which decomposes the amalgam into sodium hydroxide, hydrogen and mercury. The mercury is recycled into the <b>electrolytic</b> cell. <b>Chlorine</b> is produced at the anode and evaporates out of the cell. Mercury cells are being phased out due to concerns about mercury poisoning from mercury cell pollution such as occurred in Canada (see Ontario Minamata disease) and Japan (see Minamata disease).|$|R
2500|$|RuO2 is {{extensively}} {{used for}} the coating of titanium anodes for the <b>electrolytic</b> production of <b>chlorine</b> and for the preparation of resistors or integrated circuits.

It can be also used as active material in supercapacitor because has very high charge transfer capability. [...] Ruthenium oxide has great capacity to store charge when used in aqueous solutions. Average capacities of ruthenium(IV) oxide have reached 650nbsp&F/g when in H2SO4 solution and annealed at temperatures lower than 200nbsp&°C. In attempts to optimise its capacitive properties, prior work has looked at the hydration of ruthenium oxide, its crystallinity and particle size.|$|R

40|$|Performance {{improvement}} in electrode coatings plays {{a critical role}} in reducing energy consumption (i. e., overpotential) in the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>chlorine</b> production. The performance dependence on the chemical composition, surface morphology and phase structure of the oxide coatings has been investigated systematically. The multi-component RuTiMOx system prepared by the sol-gel route improved effectively the catalytic performance with M = Ir, Sn, V. The impermeable crack-free coatings obtained by controlling the coating/drying process are expected to protect the Ti-substrate against passivation. Nano-pores created by lanthanum leaching from the La-containing oxide matrix provided highly accessible surface. A novel in-situ supported rutile RuTiO 2 /anatase TiO 2 structure with enhanced catalytic activity was achieved by the solvothermal crystallization of the Ru-O-Ti xerogel. Cl 2 bubble evolution behaviour at the RuTiMOx/Ti electrodes has been studied in a first approach by analyzing the bubble-induced potential noise using wavelet transform. I...|$|E
40|$|A mercury-resistant {{bacterial}} strain which {{is able to}} reduce ionic mercury to metallic mercury was used to remediate in laboratory columns mercury-containing wastewater produced during <b>electrolytic</b> production of <b>chlorine.</b> Factory effluents from several chloralkali plants in Europe were analyzed, and these effluents contained total mercury concentrations between 1. 6 and 7. 6 mg/liter and high chloride concentrations (up to 25 g/liter) and had pH values which were either acidic (pH 2. 4) or alkaline (pH 13. 0). A mercury-resistant {{bacterial strain}}, Pseudomonas putida Spi 3, was isolated from polluted river sediments. Biofilms of P. putida Spi 3 were grown on porous carrier material in laboratory column bioreactors. The bioreactors were continuously fed with sterile synthetic model wastewater or nonsterile, neutralized, aerated chloralkali wastewater. We found that sodium chloride concentrations up to 24 g/liter did not inhibit microbial mercury retention and that mercury concentrations up to 7 mg/liter could be treated with the bacterial biofilm with no loss of activity. When wastewater samples from three different chloralkali plants in Europe were used, levels of mercury retention efficiency between 90 and 98 % were obtained. Thus, microbial mercury removal is a potential biological treatment for chloralkali electrolysis wastewater. Industrial use of mercury, a highly toxic metal, has led to significant mercury pollution of the environment (4, 16) ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1861, the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay {{developed}} {{a more direct}} process for producing soda ash from salt and limestone {{through the use of}} ammonia. The only waste product of this Solvay process was calcium chloride, and so it was both more economical and less polluting than the Leblanc method. From the late 1870s, Solvay-based soda works on the European continent provided stiff competition in their home markets to the Leblanc-based British soda industry. Additionally the Brunner Mond Solvay plant which opened in 1874 at Winnington near Northwich provided fierce competition nationally. Leblanc producers were unable to compete with Solvay soda ash, and their soda ash production was effectively an adjunct to their still profitable production of chlorine, bleaching powder etc. (The unwanted by-products had become the profitable products). The development of <b>electrolytic</b> methods of <b>chlorine</b> production removed that source of profits as well, and there followed a decline moderated only by [...] "gentlemen's' agreements" [...] with Solvay producers. By 1900, 90% of the world's soda production was through the Solvay method, or on the North American continent, through the mining of trona, discovered in 1938, which caused the closure of the last North American Solvay plant in 1986. The last Leblanc-based soda ash plant closed in the early 1920s. [...] However, because of solubility of the bicarbonate, the Solvay process does not work for the manufacture of potassium carbonate, and the Leblanc process continued in limited use for its manufacture until much later.|$|R
40|$|Mercury {{was known}} to ancient civi-lizations and is a modern problem. It has been mined at Almaden, in Spain, for 27 centuries and its toxic {{properties}} were known to Hippocrates 400 years before the birth of Christ. In recent years mercury has become an environ-mental problem with many deaths in Japan (Minamata disease), banning of fishing in parts of Sweden, Canada, and the United States, and {{the closing of the}} game bird season in the prairie provinces of Canada. The total world production of mer-cury during the period 1963 - 67 was 8 to 9 million kilograms (18 to 20 million pounds) per year. The U. S. usage of mercury during this period has been 2. 2 to 2. 7 million kilograms (5 to 6 million pounds) per year. King (1957) has estimated that 80 industries use mer-cury in more than 3000 different ways. The two biggest users of mercury in the United States are in electrical apparatus (13. 1 to 19. 9 %) and in the <b>electrolytic</b> preparation of <b>chlorine</b> and caustic soda (10. 2 to 20. 6 %). The usage of mercury as a fungicide over this period has varied from 81 to 127 thousand kilograms (180, 000 lb. to 280, 000 Ib) (2. 9 - 5. 6 % of total usage) in the United States (U. S. Bureau of Mines, 1967). Approxi-mately half of the mercury used was recycled in 1967; there are reports that the situation has improved since then. Unlike many global contaminators that are causing concern today mercury is naturally occurring. Beside the direct use of mercury by man, other human activities such as the burning of fossil fuel and land clearance leading to great-er erosion increase the cycling rate of mercury. The overall cycling of mercury is given in Figure 1. The earliest defini-tive measurements are those of Stock and Cucuel (1934). At this time the world production of mercury was about a quarter of current levels. Stock and Cucuel gave a value of 0. 03 ng/g fo...|$|R
