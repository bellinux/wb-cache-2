The original publication {{is available at}} [URL] term ‘covert research’ refers to research on human subjects for which informed consent is not, and allegedly cannot, be solicited – not because of wilful negligence or the <b>deliberate</b> <b>transgression</b> <b>of</b> research ethics guidelines {{on the part of}} the researcher(s), but because the revelation of the nature of the research to the involved research participants would necessarily invalidate the research results. While covert research is deemed necessary in a number of sciences, such as ethnography, such research nevertheless elicits major ethical concern due to the fact that it seemingly violates the values of respect for autonomy and the protection of research subjects – values that have, since the first formulations of the Nuremberg Code, the Belmont Declaration and the series of Helsinki accords, become almost axiomatic in our understanding of the basic tenets of responsible and ethical research on human subjects. In this article, I contend that while subject autonomy is a pivotal value in morally legitimate research generally, there is more to morally legitimate research than informed consent. I conclude by formulating a few guidelines for the identification of circumstances under which covert research might and might not be morally in order. [URL] versio...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} examines {{concepts of}} Home and Otherness in selected nineteenth-century fairy tales (by Amalia Schoppe, Heinrich Heine, Elisabeth Ebeling, Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach, Hugo von Hofmannsthal). Influenced by Benedict Anderson 2 ̆ 7 s concept of 2 ̆ 2 imagined communities 2 ̆ 2 and Susanne Zantop 2 ̆ 7 s investigations of 2 ̆ 2 colonial fantasies, 2 ̆ 2 I analyze {{the fairy tale}} 2 ̆ 7 s traditional plot (home/stasis, journey/crisis, homecoming/stasis) and its juxtaposition of home and foreignness as a template for group affiliations based on race, gender, religion, culture, and nation. Rather than viewing the spheres of home and the foreign land as separate entities, however, I center my discussion on the hero(ine) 2 ̆ 7 s <b>deliberate</b> <b>transgression</b> <b>of</b> the imagined boundaries that establish and segregate two distinct spaces. ^ The fairy tale 2 ̆ 7 s plot, the hero(ine) 2 ̆ 7 s quest, is traditionally characterized by essential differences between familiar and unfamiliar spheres and by an effort to (re) construct a primordial harmony. Taking into consideration recent debates on cultural and individual identity in postcolonial, feminist and cultural studies (e. g., Bhabha, Stanford Friedman, Sollors, Clifford), I focus {{on the process of}} border-crossing as negotiations and constructions of (cultural, national, racial, gender, or modern) identity. I interpret the hero(ine) 2 ̆ 7 s quest as an ongoing formation and reformation of home (roots) through the encounter of Otherness (routes), and the protagonist 2 ̆ 7 s return [...] -the fairy tale 2 ̆ 7 s happy end [...] -as a possible 2 ̆ 2 symbiosis between roots and routes 2 ̆ 2 (Stanford Friedman). ^ This approach establishes nineteenth-century fairy tales as spaces of identity that do not only (re) present a certain cultural community but also, and more importantly, identify an increasing need to defend, negotiate or reject an isomorphism of Home in a century of enormous sociopolitical changes, increasing individual choices, and multiplying meanings of identity. Thus, my dissertation offers an original perspective on the cultural importance and the (ongoing) popularity of the genre: I argue that the imagination of hybrid identities, produced by varying practices of border-crossing, is a crucial characteristic of the genre, and that it is the attraction and/or aversion to hybridity that causes the 2 ̆ 2 German obsession with fairy tales 2 ̆ 2 (Zipes) in the nineteenth century and ever after. ...|$|R
60|$|Major Melville {{had been}} versed in camps and cities; he was {{vigilant}} by profession and cautious from experience, {{had met with}} much evil in the world, and therefore, though himself an upright magistrate and an honourable man, his opinions of others were always strict, and sometimes unjustly severe. Mr. Morton, on the contrary, had passed from the literary pursuits of a college, where he was beloved by his companions and respected by his teachers, to the ease and simplicity of his present charge, where his opportunities of witnessing evil were few, and never dwelt upon {{but in order to}} encourage repentance and amendment; and where the love and respect of his parishioners repaid his affectionate zeal in their behalf by endeavouring to disguise from him what they knew would give him the most acute pain, namely, their own occasional <b>transgressions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duties</b> which it was the business of his life to recommend. Thus it was a common saying in the neighbourhood (though both were popular characters), that the laird knew only the ill in the parish and the minister only the good.|$|R

Therefore, policy messages that proscribe these drinking practices with moral force are likely to be subverted and rendered counter-productive. The qualitative analysis draws on critical geography and literary theories of the carnivalesque to delineate three categories <b>of</b> transgression: <b>transgressions</b> <b>of</b> space and place, <b>transgressions</b> <b>of</b> the body, and <b>transgressions</b> <b>of</b> the social order.

Hence, ‘wilful negligence’ is defined by listing specific <b>transgressions</b> <b>of</b> law: for example, police officers not putting down accurately in writing the victim’s complaint; not reading out to the victims what has been recorded prior to getting their signature; not registering FIR under the Act; not registering it under appropriate sections of the Act; etc.|$|R

50|$|The {{symbolic}} code {{produces a}} structure of (often paired) symbolic meanings that accumulate throughout the text to establish a larger structure in which the meanings of the story unfold. These symbolic clusters of meanings might be around such oppositions as male/female, inside/outside, hidden/revealed, hot/cold. Some of the key symbolic processes in 'Sarrasine', according to Barthes, are (1) rhetorical (<b>transgression</b> <b>of</b> the rhetorical figure: antitheses), (2) sexual (<b>transgression</b> <b>of</b> the sex: castration), and (3) economic (<b>transgression</b> <b>of</b> the origin of wealth) (XCII). This structure is not itself stable {{and the work of}} the 'writerly' reader is to pursue these structures until they begin to break down, a symbolic collapse that is {{a key part of the}} pleasures of the text.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{continue}} our study <b>of</b> the <b>transgression</b> <b>of</b> characteristic classes of hyperholomorphic bundles on hyperkähler manifolds [2]. In the previous paper the global construction for the fourth order <b>transgression</b> <b>of</b> the Chern character form on a compact hyperkähler manifold was proposed. In addition, the explicit expression for the <b>transgression</b> <b>of</b> the Chern character arising {{in the application of}} the local families index theorem was found. This construction was local over the base of the fibration. It is natural to look for a local derivation <b>of</b> the <b>transgression</b> <b>of</b> the Chern character forms for an arbitrary hyperholomorphic bundle. In this paper we give the general local construction for an arbitrary hyperholomorphic bundle on a four-dimensional dimensional hyperkähler manifold. Note that in d = 4 the condition on a hermitian bundle to be hyperholomorphic is equivalent to the (anti) self-duality condition on the corresponding connection. We propose an explicit expression for the fourth order <b>transgression</b> T(E) <b>of</b> the top degree part of the Chern character form for an arbitrary vector bundle E supplied with a self-dual connection. The construction is local and thus is applicable to an arbitrary four dimensional hyperkähler manifold M. Locally the Chern character form is exact and we have: ch [2](E) = volM ∆ 2...|$|R
