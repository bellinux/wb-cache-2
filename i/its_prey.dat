5|$|Bleating: Similar to the meow of the {{domestic}} cat, the cheetah can bleat, and sometimes moan, when a larger predator deprives it of <b>its</b> <b>prey.</b>|$|E
5|$|The broad, heavily calcified {{jaws and}} nearly {{terminal}} mouth, combined with robust, serrated teeth, enable the tiger shark {{to take on}} these large prey. In addition, excellent eyesight and acute sense of smell enable it to react to faint traces of blood and follow them to the source. The ability to pick up low-frequency pressure waves enables the shark to advance towards an animal with confidence, even in murky water. The shark circles <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> and studies it by prodding it with its snout. When attacking, the shark often eats <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> whole, although larger prey are often eaten in gradual large bites and finished over time.|$|E
5|$|A protocarnivorous plant (sometimes also paracarnivorous, subcarnivorous, or {{borderline}} carnivore), {{according to}} some definitions, traps and kills insects or other animals but lacks the ability to either directly digest or absorb nutrients from <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> like a carnivorous plant. The morphological adaptations such as sticky trichomes or pitfall traps of protocarnivorous plants parallel the trap structures of confirmed carnivorous plants.|$|E
25|$|In general {{countryside}} : Because of its acute {{sense of}} smell, it {{is capable of}} outmanoeuvring many of <b>its</b> <b>prey's</b> tactics.|$|R

5|$|A {{study in}} 2014 shows that Dimetrodon {{was in an}} arms race against <b>its</b> <b>prey.</b> The smaller species, D.milleri had no {{serrations}} since it ate small prey. As the prey grew larger, Dimetrodon started developing serrations and increasing in size. D.limbatus had enamel serrations that help it cut through flesh, and the same serrations {{can be found on}} Secodontosaurus. The second largest dimetrodon species, D.grandis, has denticle serrations similar to sharks and theropod dinosaurs, making its teeth even more specialized to slice through flesh. This study not only shows the evolution of Dimetrodon over millions of years, but also shows that Dimetrodon was in an arms race against <b>its</b> <b>prey.</b> As prey grew larger, Dimetrodon countered it by growing larger and having sharper teeth.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{example that}} does not involve any luring is the zone-tailed hawk, which resembles the turkey vulture. It flies amongst the vultures, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing <b>its</b> <b>prey.</b> Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the Ice Age, with the loss of cold and dry {{conditions}} and the extinction of much of <b>its</b> <b>prey,</b> the Beringian wolf became extinct. The extinction of <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> has been attributed to the impact of climate change, competition with other species, including humans, or a combination of both factors. Local genetic populations were replaced by others from within the same species or of the same genus. Of the North American wolves, only the ancestor of the modern North American gray wolf survived. The remains of ancient wolves with similar skulls and dentition have been found in western Beringia (north-east Siberia). In 2016 a study showed that some of the wolves now living in remote corners of China and Mongolia share a common maternal ancestor with one 28,000-year-old eastern Beringian wolf specimen.|$|E

5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{may also}} have used its neck to capture <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> via suction feeding. After flexing its neck to the side (which would have been {{facilitated}} by the slenderness of the cervical ribs), the act of straightening the neck would have caused the cervical ribs to splay outwards due to {{the action of the}} neck muscles attached to the ribs. As the head lunged forward, the volume of the esophagus would have increased, creating suction. Once the prey was caught, the fang-like teeth would have secured the prey in the mouth. Like other aquatic amniotes, Dinocephalosaurus would have swallowed and digested <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> head-first, as evinced by the preservation of a perleidid fish in the abdominal region of LPV 30280 from Luoping.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis or cryptic {{aggressive}} mimicry {{is where}} the predator mimics an organism that <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> is indifferent to. Unlike in all cases above, the predator is ignored by the prey, allowing it to avoid detection until the prey are close enough for the predator to strike. This is effectively a form of camouflage. The zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus), which resembles the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), may provide one such example. It flies amongst them, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing <b>its</b> <b>prey.</b> Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively. There is some controversy over {{whether this is a}} true case of mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Seals {{typically}} consume {{their prey}} underwater {{where it is}} swallowed whole. Prey that is too large or awkward is taken to the surface to be torn apart. The leopard seal, a prolific predator of penguins, is known to violently swing <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> back and forth until it is decapitated. The elaborately cusped teeth of filter-feeding species, such as crabeater seals, allow them to remove water before they swallow their planktonic food. The walrus is unique in that it consumes <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> by suction feeding, using its tongue to suck the meat of a bivalve out of the shell. While pinnipeds mostly hunt in the water, South American sea lions are known to chase down penguins on land. Some species may swallow stones or pebbles for reasons not understood. Though they can drink seawater, pinnipeds get most of their fluid intake from the food they eat.|$|E
50|$|The laced moray is carnivorous, {{it leaves}} its lair {{at night to}} {{actively}} hunt <b>its</b> <b>preys</b> along the reef.It feeds mainly on small fish and cephalopods. Large adults are prone to be aggressive in the wild.|$|R
50|$|Epinephelus flavocaeruleus is solitary and sedentary, it's {{defending}} a well bounded territory. It hunts from a hide <b>its</b> <b>preys</b> rather at dusk. Like other groupers, it's carnivorous and its diet is mainly many different fishes, crustaceans and squids.|$|R
50|$|Actinia schmidti leads a benthic way of {{life and}} is an active {{carnivorous}} which catches <b>its</b> <b>preys</b> at night by displaying its stinging tentacles.Its diet consists in zooplankton, small fishes, tiny crustaceans and organic detritus drifting in the water.|$|R
5|$|The European {{nightjar}} {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, including moths, beetles, mantises, dragonflies, cockroaches and flies. It will pick glowworms off vegetation. It consumes grit to aid with digesting <b>its</b> <b>prey,</b> but any plant material and non-flying invertebrates consumed are taken inadvertently while hunting other food items. Young chicks have been known to eat their own faeces.|$|E
5|$|The Man-of-War (as it {{is called}} by the English) is about the bigness of a Kite, and in shape like it, but black; and the neck is red. It lives on Fish yet never lights on the water, but soars aloft like a Kite, and when it sees <b>its</b> <b>prey,</b> it flys down head {{foremost}} to the Waters edge, very swiftly takes <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> out of the Sea with his Bill, and immediately mounts again as swiftly; never touching the Water with his Bill. His Wings are very long; his feet are like other Land-fowl, and he builds on Trees, where he finds any; but where they are wanting on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} mostly forages in the {{understory}} {{instead of}} the canopy. The large leaves and long branches in the understory affect its foraging behaviors. The black-throated blue warbler more often hovers rather than gleans <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> {{because it is more}} difficult to glean among thick understory foliage.|$|E
50|$|The conger moray is {{a solitary}} {{carnivorous}} fish, it leaves its lair {{at night to}} actively hunt <b>its</b> <b>preys</b> along the reef {{but it can also}} been observed hunting during daytime.It feeds mainly on small invertebrates like crustaceans and mollusks, rarely on small fishes.|$|R
50|$|This {{is where}} one {{organism}} hunts and eats the other organism. The organism hunting {{is called the}} predator, while the organism being hunted is called the prey. Energy received from the Sun is transferred from animals when the prey is eaten by the predator. The predator now has <b>its</b> <b>prey's</b> energy.|$|R

5|$|The cookiecutter shark {{exhibits}} {{a number of}} specializations to its mouth and pharynx for its parasitic lifestyle. The shark first secures itself to the body surface of <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> by closing its spiracles and retracting its basihyal (tongue) to create pressure {{lower than that of}} the surroundings; its suctorial lips ensure a tight seal. It then bites, using its narrow upper teeth as anchors while its razor sharp lower teeth slice into the prey. Finally, the shark twists and rotates its body to complete a circular cut, quite possibly aided by the initial forward momentum and subsequent struggles of <b>its</b> <b>prey.</b> The action of the lower teeth may also be assisted by back-and-forth vibrations of the jaw, a mechanism akin to that of an electric carving knife. This shark's ability to create strong suction into its mouth is likely also of utility in capturing smaller prey such as squid.|$|E
5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Its large and {{powerful}} jaws serve as an effective tool for dismantling <b>its</b> <b>prey.</b> Young loggerheads are exploited by numerous predators; the eggs are especially vulnerable to terrestrial organisms. Once the turtles reach adulthood, their formidable size limits predation to large marine animals, such as sharks.|$|E
5|$|Their diet {{consists}} {{primarily of}} small aquatic prey, such as insects and small fishes. Crayfish are its preferred food in most regions, {{but it can}} adjust its diet according to the habitat and prey abundance. Its main foraging behavior is probing with its beak {{at the bottom of}} shallow water to feel for and capture <b>its</b> <b>prey.</b> It does not see the prey.|$|E
50|$|Acrochordus javanicus is {{an ambush}} {{predator}} that likes to capture fishes and amphibians. It usually catch <b>its</b> <b>preys</b> by folding firmly its body around it. Its loose, baggy skin and its sharp scales find their utility by limiting any risk of escape of the prey, in particular fishes which have bodies {{is covered with}} a viscous, protective mucus.|$|R
50|$|With {{some other}} species from the Lanius genus, {{like the great}} grey shrike (Lanius excubitor), the bull-headed shrike is known to impale some of <b>its</b> <b>preys</b> upon a sharp point - usually thorns - so the food can be ripped into {{bite-sized}} pieces more easily. It may also do this to cache food and to mark a territory boundary.|$|R
5000|$|Haast's eagles preyed on large, flightless bird species, {{including}} the moa, which {{was up to}} fifteen times {{the weight of the}} eagle. It is estimated to have attacked at speeds up to 80 km/h, often seizing <b>its</b> <b>prey's</b> pelvis with the talons of one foot and killing with a blow to the head or neck with the other.|$|R
5|$|This species forages in {{the early}} morning or late {{afternoon}} either alone or in small groups in leaf litter and on dead tree trunks. It is also known to leap upwards to grab prey on overhanging foliage. It looks for <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> either by standing still and scanning the surrounding area or by tossing the leaf litter away with its beak. It also frequently follows columns of Dorylus ants, feeding on the insects flushed by the ants. It also is known to hunt in streams for crabs and fish. It crushes snails with its beak and, if <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> struggles, smashes it against the ground. While an uncommon occurrence, male rockfowl have been observed giving food to a female.|$|E
5|$|Another fossil {{from the}} Yixian Formation {{provides}} direct evidence of Psittacosaurus as a prey animal. One skeleton of Repenomamus robustus, a large triconodont mammal, is preserved with {{the remains of}} a juvenile Psittacosaurus in its abdominal cavity. Several of the juvenile's bones are still articulated, indicating that the carnivorous mammal swallowed <b>its</b> <b>prey</b> in large chunks. This specimen is notable in that it is the first known example of Mesozoic mammals preying on live dinosaurs. Heavy predation on juvenile Psittacosaurus may have resulted in R-selection, the production of more numerous offspring to counteract this loss.|$|E
5|$|Ectoparasites {{known to}} infest weasels include the louse Trichodectes mustelae and the mites Demodex and Psoregates mustela. The species may catch fleas from the nests and burrows of <b>its</b> <b>prey.</b> Flea species known to infest weasels include Ctenophthalmus bisoctodentatus and Palaeopsylla m. minor, which {{they get from}} moles, P. s. soricis, which they get from shrews, Nosopsyllus fasciatus, which they get from rodents and Dasypsyllus gallinulae which they get from birds.|$|E
