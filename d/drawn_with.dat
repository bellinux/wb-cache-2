5|$|Celtic {{began the}} 2013–14 season with further Champions League success in their sights. Celtic were <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> Cliftonville {{in their first}} {{qualifying}} round and easily disposed of the Northern Irish champions 50 on aggregate. They were next <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> IF Elfsborg and squeezed by with a 10 aggregate win, with Kris Commons scoring the only goal in the first leg at Celtic Park. Although favoured {{to qualify for the}} group stages with minimal challenge after being <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> Kazakh champions Shakhter Karagandy, Celtic found themselves losing the first leg in Karagandy 20. Celtic returned to Scotland to an electric atmosphere at Celtic Park in the home leg, in what proved to be the high point of their 2013–14 Champions League campaign. They overcame the 20 deficit to level the aggregate thanks to goals by Kris Commons and Georgios Samaras. James Forrest completed the comeback for Celtic with a 90th-minute strike, sending Celtic Park into a frenzy.|$|E

5|$|He {{returned}} to the county matches and scored 162 against Lancashire, before scoring 27 and 19 as England squared the series in the Third Test at Headingley.

5|$|As I {{made clear}} in my {{telegram}} to the FIDE delegates, the match conditions I proposed were non-negotiable. Mr. Cramer informs {{me that the}} rules of the winner being the first player to win ten games, draws not counting, unlimited number of games and if nine wins to nine match is <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> champion regaining title and prize fund split equally were rejected by the FIDE delegates. By so doing FIDE has decided against my participation in the 1975 World Chess Championship. Therefore, I resign my FIDE World Chess Championship title. Sincerely, Bobby Fischer.|$|E

50|$|Bertos {{played in}} all three games at the World Cup, putting in gritty {{performances}} to earn New Zealand a 1-1 <b>draw</b> <b>with</b> Slovakia, a 1-1 <b>draw</b> <b>with</b> reigning world champions Italy, and their final 0-0 <b>draw</b> <b>with</b> Paraguay.|$|R

5|$|At the World Cup, Croatia were <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> host-nation Brazil, Mexico and Cameroon. In {{the opening}} {{game of the}} tournament, Croatia lost 3–1 to Brazil. The match {{garnered}} heavy media attention as Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura was scrutinized {{for a number of}} controversial decisions. In their second game, Croatia won 4–0 against Cameroon, but did not progress from the group as they lost 3–1 to Mexico in their final fixture.|$|E
5|$|Belldandy is {{regarded}} by commentators {{as an example}} of the magical girlfriend character, and comparisons have been <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> the characters of Samantha from Bewitched and Jeannie from I Dream of Jeannie. The character's very conservative nature, however, which almost completely subordinates her to her fictional boyfriend, Keiichi, has led to some concerns from critics and has polarized the audience.|$|E

His British Lions career added a further 30international points, {{with a single}} try, 3conversions, 5penalties and 2dropped goals. For Cardiff he played 5seasons, playing 93matches, during which he scored 24tries and 30dropped goals. His dropped goal total for Cardiff was the club's second highest total, <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> Wilf Wooller but short of Percy Bush's tally of 35.|$|E

6000|$|... 46. Do not, therefore, {{think your}} drawing must be weak {{because you have}} a finely pointed pen in your hand. Till you can <b>draw</b> <b>with</b> that, you can <b>draw</b> <b>with</b> nothing; when you can <b>draw</b> <b>with</b> that, you can <b>draw</b> <b>with</b> a log of wood charred at the end. True boldness and power are only to be gained by care. Even in fencing and dancing, all {{ultimate}} ease depends on early precision in the commencement; much more in singing or drawing.|$|R
50|$|Sittenfeld played several {{matches in}} Paris. In 1891 he <b>drew</b> <b>with</b> Jean Taubenhaus and won against Dawid Janowski. In 1892 he lost to Janowski and <b>drew</b> <b>with</b> him in 1893.|$|R
5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an Enlightenment belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> what she claims is genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical tableaux.|$|E
5|$|On {{one side}} of the road is a barber surgeon whose sign advertises Shaving, bleeding, and teeth <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> a touch. Ecce signum! Inside the shop, the barber, who may be drunk, haphazardly shaves a customer, holding his nose like that of a pig, while spots of blood darken the cloth under his chin. The {{surgeons}} and barbers had been a single profession since 1540 and would not finally separate until 1745, when the surgeons broke away to form the Company of Surgeons. Bowls on the windowsill contain blood from the day's patients.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{methods can}} be used to enclose an {{arbitrary}} simple polygon within a curve of constant width, whose width equals the diameter of the given polygon. The resulting shape consists of circular arcs (at most as many as sides of the polygon), can be constructed algorithmically in linear time, and can be <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> compass and straightedge. Although the regular-polygon based Reuleaux polygons all have an odd number of circular-arc sides, it is possible to construct constant-width shapes based on irregular polygons that have an even number of sides.|$|E

5|$|The {{intended}} dive {{profile is}} {{useful as a}} planning tool {{as an indication of}} the risks of decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity for the exposure, and also for estimating the volume of open-circuit breathing gas needed for a planned dive, as these depend in part upon the depth and duration of the dive. A dive profile diagram is conventionally <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> elapsed time running from left to right and depth increasing down the page.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} {{expected}} {{to participate in the}} 2010 African Women's Championship and was scheduled to play against Mali but withdrew before the competition started. The same occurred in the 2016 Africa Women Cup of Nations qualification process, where Togo was <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> Algeria, but withdrew before playing any game. The team was replaced by Ethiopia, and were excluded from participating in the 2018 edition in Ghana.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Celtic found {{themselves}} <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> AC Milan, Ajax and again Barcelona {{in the group}} stage. The campaign was dismal, winning only once with a 21 home win over Ajax, and slumping to a 61 rout away against Barcelona in the final group match. That game saw Celtic concede the most goals they had ever done in a single European tie, and equalled their previous heaviest defeat in Europe, a 5–0 loss to Artmedia Bratislava.|$|E

5|$|Van Meegeren was a {{prolific}} artist and produced thousands of original paintings {{in a number}} of diverse styles. This wide range in painting and drawing styles often irritated art critics. Some of his typical works are classical still lifes in convincing 17th century manner, Impressionistic paintings of people frolicking on lakes or beaches, jocular drawings where the subject is <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> rather odd features, Surrealistic paintings with combined fore- and backgrounds. Van Meegeren's portraits, however, are probably his finest works.|$|E
5|$|A fifth-place {{finish in}} the Premier League in 2004–05 meant Liverpool were not {{guaranteed}} entry into the Champions League, and faced the prospect {{of not being able}} to defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would be allowed to do so, but would be required to start in the first qualifying round, with no country protection, meaning they could face a team from England in the group stages. This turned out to be the case—Liverpool advanced through three qualifying rounds and were <b>drawn</b> <b>with</b> Chelsea in the group stages. They progressed from their group as winners but were beaten by Benfica in the first knock-out round.|$|E
5|$|A team {{must win}} a series {{to hold the}} Wisden Trophy. A drawn series results in the {{previous}} holders retaining the trophy. To date, a total of 23 Wisden Trophy series have been played, with West Indies winning 13 and England 6. The remaining 3 series were <b>drawn,</b> <b>with</b> West Indies retaining the Wisden Trophy on each occasion (1973–74, 1991 and 1995). In the series' 44-year history the Wisden Trophy has changed hands on five occasions (1968, 1973, 2000 and twice in 2009) with England regaining the trophy in 1968, 2000 and May 2009, while the West Indies regained it in 1973 and April 2009.|$|E
