The occurrence in an implementation, of all the faults of a given diagnosis, allows the explanation of all observed implementation outputs. The algorithm guarantees the correct diagnosis of certain configurations of faults (output and/or transfer) in an implementation, which are characterized by a certain type of independence of the different faults.

This new formalism allows the specification of concurrency between inputs and outputs in a very general, direct and concise way. In this paper, we give a formal definition of this formalism, and define several conformance relations for comparing system specifications expressed in this formalism.

40|$|Detecting {{abnormal}} operating conditions, {{which will}} lead to faults developing later, has important economic implications for industries trying to meet their performance and production goals. It is unacceptable to wait for failures that have potential safety, environmental and financial consequences. Moving from a “reactive” strategy to a “proactive” strategy can improve critical equipment reliability and availability while constraining maintenance costs, reducing production deferrals and decreasing the need for spare parts. Once the fault initiates, predicting its progression and deterioration can enable timely interventions without risk to personnel safety or to equipment integrity. This work presents an online-integrated condition monitoring and prognostics framework that addresses the above issues holistically. The proposed framework aligns fully with ISO 17359 : 2011 and derives from the I-P and P-F curve. Depending upon the running state of machine with respect to its I-P and P-F curve an algorithm will do one of the following: (1) Predict the ideal behaviour and any departure from the normal operating envelope {{using a combination of}} Evolving Clustering Method (ECM), a normalised fuzzy weighted distance and tracking signal method. (2) Identify the cause of the departure through an automated diagnostics system using a modified version of ECM for classification. (3) Predict the short-term progression of fault using {{a modified version of the}} Dynamic Evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (DENFIS), called here MDENFIS and a tracking signal method.

40|$|Séminaire des jeudis de la com' de l'équipe SCNUsually, {{there are}} two ways that a combinational logic {{function}} can be implemented in FPGAs, i) Multiplexer-based and ii) Memory-based (Look-Up Tables [LUT]). ARDyT CLE architecture plans to have LUT-based structure, {{as in the case of}} Xilinx Virtex architectures, due to the advantage of implementing maximum possible logic functions in it, when compared to multiplexer-based architectures. The content of LUT-SRAM cells are part of FPGA's configuration bitstream and they are protected using built-in configuration bitstream scheme. The focus here is to deal with the faults occurring in the multiplexers. It is very important to understand the fault models and their consequences before applying fault mitigation schemes to any given logic resource. As far as multiplexers are concerned, it does not contain any storage element to get affected by radiation-induced single event upsets and thereby to create a consequence of single-bit or multi-bit upsets. Faults in multiplexers are more of transient effects and circuit faults. The circuit level faults include radiation-induced stuck-at-faults and bridging faults. Unlike fabrication faults, the effect of these radiation induction faults could be temporary as well as permanent according to the nature and intensity of the radiation particle. Figure shown above demonstrates, how to check the 4 : 1 multiplexer with the 'Two-Rail Checker' circuit. The transistor pairs (Q 17 -Q 18 and Q 19 -Q 20) used in the checker circuit, are characterized by different aspect ratios to achieve different voltage thresholds VT 1 and VT 2. If the 'OUT' node is at an intermediate voltage, the checker circuit outputs E 1 and E 2 produce different voltage levels, if not, E 1 and E 2 are at same voltage level. The 'OUT' node is at intermediate voltage when there is a fault in the circuit. Hence it is interpreted as, in the absence of <b>fault,</b> <b>output</b> of the checker circuit E 1 and E 2 assume the value 11 or 00. If a fault occurs in the multiplexer, E 1 and E 2 shall assume the value 01 or 10.

40|$|According to {{the fact}} that the {{performance}} of power management systems depends on generation forecasts, a scheme is proposed to detect the shading fault and the converter failure in a PV system and determine the maximum available solar power in the presence of these faults. Since the MPP of a PV array under uniform and partial shading faults is smaller than that of non-shading condition, for MPP tracking operations, difference between acquired and estimated power is an indicator for the shading fault. However, when the load power is small enough to be satisfied by the shaded PV array, the defined voltage ratio is used to detect the shading fault. In the case of shading fault, maximum available solar power is determined based on the output power of the PV system. Converter failure, which is modeled as the switch stuck-open fault or the switch stuck-on fault, is also considered in this paper. It is shown that under the switch stuck-open <b>fault,</b> the <b>output</b> power of the PV system will be zero; while, under the switch stuck-on <b>fault,</b> the <b>output</b> power shows a sinusoidal behavior.

40|$|A new fault {{simulation}} method is presented here. The method relies on simulation cycle timing of event-driven simulators (delta delays in VHDL). This timing {{is used for}} propagation of faulty values in faulty sections of a circuit. This method is based on concurrent {{fault simulation}} and is implemented in VHDL. VHDL gate models {{that are capable of}} propagating faults in fault queues perform this fault simulation. Gate models process their fault queues and propagate them in delta time units. In these models, gates with faulty input values are expanded in delta time to evaluate faulty output values and propagate them to other sections of the circuit. Using ISCAS benchmarks, a performance improvement of up to 500 X over serial fault simulation has been obtained. This work is useful for fault simulation of post-synthesis VHDL <b>outputs.</b> <b>Fault</b> simulation methodology The VHDL-based fault simulation method discussed here is referred to as Sequentially Propagated Concurrent Fault Simulation (SPC-FS). Implementing fault simulation in an event-driven simulation environment like VHDL requires circuit components or primitive gates to be sensitive to faults on their inputs as they are sensitive to changing like values in an ordinary simulation. A primitive gate that receives a fault on its input propagates the <b>fault</b> to its <b>output</b> unless it is masked by its good value or by faults on gate’s other inputs (the latter situation occurs when gate is on a reconvergent point of a fanout). Each gates receives a list of faults on its inputs and processes each fault independently and sends a list of propagatable <b>faults</b> to its <b>output.</b> These lists are referred to as fault queues. A queue contains a begin marker (that also contains the line good value), fault elements, and an end marker. A fault element consists of a faulty value and fault’s unique id. In addition to propagating faults at its inputs, a fault simulation gate model adds its own faults (the faults that are injected on gate’s inputs) to the queue of <b>faults</b> on its <b>output.</b> This i...|$|R
