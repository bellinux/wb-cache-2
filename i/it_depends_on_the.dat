5|$|The {{nominal volume}} of gas stored is {{commonly}} quoted as the cylinder {{capacity in the}} USA. It {{is a measure of}} the volume of gas that can be released from the full cylinder at atmospheric pressure. Terms used for the capacity include 'free gas volume' or 'free gas equivalent'. <b>It</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> internal volume and the working pressure of a cylinder. If the working pressure is higher, the cylinder will store more gas for the same volume.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of the {{recognized}} moons of the planets and of the largest dwarf planets of the Solar System. The 19 moons that are large enough to have been rounded by their own gravity are listed in bold. The seven largest moons, which are larger than any of the known dwarf planets, are listed in bold and italic. Sidereal period differs from semi-major axis because <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mass of the primary as well as the satellite's distance from it.|$|E
5|$|Khonsari first {{discussed}} {{the game in}} February 2011, announcing it as 1979: The Game. It was initially intended to be episodic, consisting of three or nine episodes, but was later reduced to one game. A crowdfunding campaign for the game was launched on Kickstarter in 2013 with a goal of US$395,000, but failed to reach its goal, {{with a total of}} US$304,741 raised. Additional fundraising was set up on the game's website. Following the failed campaign, the team partnered with the New Frontier Story Lab at Sundance in 2014 and 2015, the Museum of the Moving Image in New York, and the Doris Duke Foundation. 1979 Revolution was approved through Steam Greenlight in July 2015, and was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X on April 5, 2016, for iOS devices on June 10, 2016, and for Android devices on December 14, 2016; console versions are also in development. The game is also planned to have Oculus Rift support; the team rewrote one of the interrogation scenes to fit with the experience. 1979 Revolution runs on the Unity game engine. Khonsari has expressed interest in a sequel, stating that <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> commercial success of the first game. He is also interested in developing additional games about other historical events.|$|E
