She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{discusses}} the possible economic effect on regional development by developing applicable methodology and analysing differences in costs, both operational costs and <b>initial</b> <b>investments,</b> of {{two types of}} buses serving urban public transportation systems – diesel fuelled internal combustion engine bus and battery electric bus. Comparison of <b>initial</b> <b>investments</b> to operate the both types of buses shows large <b>initial</b> <b>investments</b> involved when electric energy is being added/used. At the same time operational costs, including energy costs, show opposite picture, especially with large annual distances covered – electrical energy is substantially cheaper. The research shows, that within current state of affairs in Latvia, <b>initial</b> <b>investments</b> of changing public transportation fleet to electric buses {{and the costs of}} battery replacement still outweighs the monetary advantages gained from lower operational costs and additional environmental benefits...|$|R

Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} the film {{originated}} from a suggestion by Michael Ferris Gibson, {{who had made the}} 2005 documentary 24 Hours on Craigslist. Gibson, a producer on the film, met with co-director Nic Hill. Gibson financed Hill's travels while making the film. The working title for the film was Truth in Numbers: The Wikipedia Story. Gibson chose to finance the film through a request for funding from Internet visitors; the initial request drew in US$20,000 in <b>initial</b> <b>investment.</b> The production team made their initial work on the project known to Internet viewers via the website www.wikidocumentary.org. Another collaborative website focused on the documentary was formed at Wikia, located at wikidocumentary.wikia.com. Regarding his financing strategy, Gibson commented to the San Francisco Chronicle, that smaller incremental donations from multiple individuals showed genuine interest in his initiative.|$|E

40|$|We compare certain {{bankruptcy}} {{rules in}} a bankruptcy model with an en-dogenous estate {{on the basis}} of normative criteria.

The proportional rule receives the strongest support from this normative analysis among the rules consid-ered. We also observe that the performance of the proportional rule improves in the family of bankruptcy problems with endogenous estates compared to the general set of bankruptcy problems. Our results complement those in Karago-zoglu (2008) and provide a broader perspective to bankruptcy problems with endogenous estates...|$|R
