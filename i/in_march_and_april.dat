In any event, the SAO Krajina was declared, which consisted of any Croatian territory with a substantial Serb population. The Croatian government viewed this move as a rebellion.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} few months, the wing was not {{assigned}} any aircraft, and thus worked with other units who were in possession of the B-36 Peacemaker. <b>In</b> <b>March</b> <b>and</b> <b>April,</b> the base began preparing for operations of the B-36, which arrived later in April.

Additionally, more buildings were constructed on base, making it more of a home for airmen and their families.|$|E

5|$|In {{most places}} on Fishing Creek, {{there is not}} enough {{dissolved}} aluminum to be toxic, although East Branch Fishing Creek has aluminum concentrations of over 100μg per liter, approaching a lethal level for fish. Fishing Creek itself and all its other tributaries have concentrations of less than 70μg per liter. The concentration is seasonal: aluminum trapped in frozen ground is released into the streams when the soil thaws. As a result, aluminum levels in the creek peak <b>in</b> <b>March</b> <b>and</b> <b>April</b> and drop to almost zero in the summer.|$|E

The 49th Pursuit Group became its {{principal}} defense. Conditions in the area were still primitive, and spare parts and equipment were scarce. Lacking adequate logistical support, the Americans were heavily dependent on their Australian allies. Morale was low, but the sight of Wurtsmith's aircraft patrolling the skies provided an important boost.|$|E

Estimates of the number of Indonesian fighters killed in the lead up and during the Battle of Surabaya range from 6,300 to 15,000. The Japanese forces lost around 1,000 soldiers and the British forces registered 660 soldiers, mostly British Indians, as killed (with a similar number missing in action).
