40|$|<b>Kindling</b> {{involves}} the progressive development of epileptiform activity that culminates in generalized seizures {{in response to}} repeated electrical stimulation of the brain. <b>Kindling</b> induces widespread changes in synaptic sensitivity and neuronal reactivity. These neuroplastic changes are evident in altered memory and behavior. 	This research was designed to further our understanding of kindling-induced deficits in spatial cognition. Two questions were examined: 1) does entorhinal cortex <b>kindling</b> disrupt spatial cognition; and 2) can bilateral bifocal <b>kindling,</b> of two brain regions known to participate in spatial cognition, produce larger cognitive deficits than unifocal <b>kindling?</b> This research attempted to confirm the spatial cognitive effects produced by unifocal dorsal hippocampal (dHPC) <b>kindling,</b> as a positive control. In contrast, the spatial cognitive effects produce by unifocal entorhinal cortex (EC) and bifocal <b>kindling</b> (i. e., EC <b>kindling</b> with subsequent contralateral dHPC <b>kindling)</b> are unknown and were examined here. Rats were subjected to unifocal EC <b>kindling,</b> unifocal dHPC <b>kindling,</b> or bifocal <b>kindling.</b> Rats exhibited fully generalized seizures prior to Morris water maze training from days 2 to 31. Visible platform trials were used to examine escape motivation and gross motor coordination, and all groups performed adequately. 	Consistent with previous research, dHPC <b>kindling</b> disrupted performance during acquisition trials; however, EC and bifocal <b>kindling</b> failed to disrupt acquisition. During retention trials, the bifocal <b>kindling</b> group displayed a disruption in performance; however, dHPC and lateral EC <b>kindling</b> failed to affect retention. The bifocal <b>kindled</b> group failed to display larger deficits than the unifocal <b>kindled</b> groups.

Ten-week-old rats, implanted with bipolar electrodes, were separated by various initial <b>kindling</b> stages into 5 groups of rats, partially <b>kindled</b> to stages 1 (n = 7) and 2 (n = 10), fully <b>kindled</b> to stages 4 (n = 11) and 5 (n = 11), and control rats (n = 12) which were implanted but not stimulated initially. The number of stimulations required to elicit the first stage 5 seizure during rekindling was significantly lower in the fully <b>kindled</b> groups (P < 0. 01 in the stage 4 group and P < 0. 001 in the stage 5 group) than the control group. The cumulative afterdischarge duration during rekindling was sig-nificantly shorter in the fully <b>kindled</b> groups (P < 0. 01 in both groups) than the control group.

40|$|Purpose: To study anticonvulsive and antiepileptogenic {{effects of}} singe {{levetiracetam}} (LEV) {{administration in the}} model of audiogenic <b>kindling.</b> Methods: Rats of Krushinsky-Molodkina (KM) strain genetically susceptible to severe audiogenic seizures received one intraperitoneal injection of saline, low (6 mg/kg) or high (50 mg/kg) dose of LEV before or after audiogenic <b>kindling.</b> One hour postinjection, an audiogenic seizure was induced to assess anticonvulsive effect of LEV in nonkindled and <b>kindled</b> rats. To examine antiepileptogenic activity of LEV, nonkindled rats injected with the drug or saline were <b>kindled</b> with repeated sound stimulations. Audiogenic <b>kindling</b> development manifested in an appearance and progressive prolongation of an additional seizure phase, post-tonic–clonus. The latency and duration of audiogenic seizures and the duration of every seizure phase (running, tonic, post-tonic–clonic) were measured. Results: One hour posttreatment, LEV dose-dependently lengthened the latency and reduced the duration of audiogenic seizures in both nonkindled and <b>kindled</b> rats. The seizure shortening resulted from selective suppression of tonic and <b>kindled</b> post-tonic–clonic phases. The dose of 50 mg/kg completely blocked tonic and clonic convulsions 1 h postinjection. The anticonvulsive effect of LEV was more pronounced in <b>kindled</b> than in nonkindled rats. Single LEV injection in the dose of 50 mg/kg prior audiogenic <b>kindling</b> significantly suppressed subsequent <b>kindling</b> progression indicating profound antiepileptogenic potency of the drug. Conclusions: The present study shows that LEV exerts both short-lasting anticonvulsive effect on audiogenic seizures and very long-lasting antiepileptogenic effect on audiogenic <b>kindling.</b> Remarkably, a single injection of LEV is enough to significantly suppress <b>kindling</b> progression in KM rats...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} partial hippocampal <b>kindling,</b> {{a model of}} {{temporal}} lobe seizure, on monosynaptic inhibition mediated by GABA was studied. <b>Kindled</b> rats were given 15 nonconvulsive hippocampal afterdischarges, and control rats were given low frequency or no stimulations. At 1 – 2 d after <b>kindling,</b> pairedpulse depression (PPD) of the IPSCs recorded in CA 1 neurons in vitro was significantly smaller in <b>kindled</b> as compared with control rats. The difference in PPD persisted for at least 21 d after <b>kindling.</b> The decrease in PPD of the IPSCs after partial hippocampal <b>kindling</b> was likely caused by a reduced GABA autoinhibition after downregulation of presynaptic GABA B receptors. The GABA B antagonist CGP 35348 (1 mM) suppressed PPD of the IPSCs more strongly in control than in <b>kindled</b> rats. Direct activation of the presynaptic GABAB receptors by baclofen suppressed the monosynaptic IPSCs significantly more in control than in <b>kindled</b> rats. The decay rate of a single-pulse IPSC was faster in <b>kindled</b> than in control rats on day 1 or day 21 after partial <b>kindling.</b> The difference in IPSC decay between <b>kindled</b> and control rats was found {{with or without a}} GABAB receptor antagonist.

40|$|Vagus nerve {{stimulation}} (VNS) is an adjunctive treatment for refractory epilepsy. Using a seizure-prone Fast-kindling rat strain with known comorbid behavioral features, we investigated {{the effects of}} VNS on spatial memory, epileptogenesis, <b>kindled</b> seizures and body weight. Electrodes were implanted in both amygdalae and around the left vagus nerve of 17 rats. Following recovery, rats were tested in the Morris water-maze utilizing a fixed platform paradigm. The VNS group received 2 h of stimulation prior to entering the Morris water-maze. Rats were then tested in the <b>kindling</b> paradigm wherein the VNS group received 2 h of stimulation prior to daily <b>kindling</b> stimulation. Finally, the abortive effects of acute VNS against kindling-induced seizures were determined in fully <b>kindled</b> rats by applying VNS immediately after the <b>kindling</b> pulse. Body weight, water consumption and food intake were measured throughout. Memory performance in the Morris water-maze was not different between control and vagus {{nerve stimulation}} rats. Similarly, <b>kindling</b> rate was unaffected by antecedent VNS. However, pro-convulsive effects (P < 0. 05) were noted, when VNS was administered prior to the <b>kindling</b> pulse in fully <b>kindled</b> rats. Yet, paradoxically, VNS showed anticonvulsant effects (P < 0. 01) in those rats when applied immediately after the <b>kindling</b> stimulus. Body weight was significantly lower throughout <b>kindling</b> (P < 0. 01) in VNS-treated rats compared with controls, which was associated with reduced food intake (P < 0. 05), but without difference in water consumption. VNS appears to be devoid of significant cognitive side effects in the Morris water-maze in Fast rats. Although VNS exhibited no prophylactic effect on epileptogenesis or seizure severity when applied prior to the <b>kindling</b> stimulus, it showed significant anti-convulsant effects in fully <b>kindled</b> rats when applied after seizure initiation. Lastly, VNS prevented the weight gain associated with <b>kindling</b> through reduced food intake. (c) 2006 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

It has been known that genetic factors {{are involved in the}} development of amygdala <b>kindling.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the loci that are responsible for the development of amygdala <b>kindling.</b> To achieve this, rat strains from a LEXF/FXLE recombinant inbred (RI) strain panel were used. The phenotypes of amygdala kindling-related parameters for seven RI strains and parental LE/Stm and F 344 /Stm strains were determined. They included the afterdischarge threshold (ADT), the afterdischarge duration (ADD), and the <b>kindling</b> rate, an incidence of development of <b>kindling.</b> Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis was performed to identify linkage relationships between these phenotypes and 1, 033 SNP markers.

40|$|Introduction: Previous {{studies have}} been shown that low {{frequency}} stimulation (LFS) has an inhibitory effect on <b>kindling</b> acquisition. However, the mechanism of this effect has not been completely determined. In the present study, the effect of LFS of the perforant path on seizures induced by rapid perforant path <b>kindling</b> was investigated. Methods: Animals were <b>kindled</b> by electrical stimulation of perforant path. One group of animals (n= 6) received LFS (0. 1 ms pulses at 1 Hz, 200 pulse, and 50 - 150 µA) after termination of each <b>kindling</b> stimulations. In control groups, animals received only <b>kindling</b> stimulations (n= 8) or LFS (n= 4). Basal field potential recording and paired pulse stimulations were done before <b>kindling</b> stimulations every days. Results: Application of LFS significantly retarded the <b>kindling</b> acquisition and {{increased the number of}} stimulations to achieve different seizure stages [F(4, 60) = 10. 9, P< 0. 0001]. LFS also prevented increment of slope of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials and population spike amplitude during <b>kindling</b> (P< 0. 001) (There was % 88. 6 ± 1. 7 increment in fEPSP and % 94 ± 2. 3 increment in PS in <b>kindled</b> group and % 3. 5 ±. 05 increment in fEPSP and % 12. 3 ± 0. 1 decrease in PS in kindled+LFS group). In addition, LFS prevented the marked increase in early (10 - 50 ms intervals) and late (300 - 1000 ms intervals) paired pulse depression induced by <b>kindling</b> significantly (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: According to obtained results, it may be suggested that LFS of perforant path has a significant antiepileptogenic effect on perforant path <b>kindled</b> seizures through inhibition of synaptic transmission in dentate gyrus.

40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) {{has been}} used to treat a variety of neurological disorders including epilepsy. However, we have limited knowledge about effective target areas, optimal stimulation parameters, and long-term effect of DBS on epileptic seizures. Here we examined the effects of DBS of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) on amygdala-kindled seizures. Microwire electrodes were implanted into the SNr and amygdala of adult male rats. When stage 5 -kindled seizures were achieved by daily amygdala <b>kindling,</b> high frequency stimulation was delivered to the SNr bilaterally 1 s after cessation of <b>kindling.</b> Our DBS protocol completely blocked <b>kindled</b> seizures in 10 out of 23 (43. 5 %) rats studied. Furthermore, when the same amygdala <b>kindling</b> procedure was performed 24 h later without DBS, the <b>kindling</b> failed to elicit any seizure signs in 6 of these 10 rats. Some of the post-DBS period of seizure suppression lasted for up to 4 days. In other 3 rats, only mild stage 1 to 2 seizures appeared following amygdala <b>kindling.</b> Only I of the 10 rats for which DBS had blocked <b>kindled</b> seizures exhibited full-scale 5 stage-kindled seizures 24 h after DBS. These results suggest that highly plastic neural networks are involved in amygdala-kindled seizures and that DBS, if well timed with the onset of amygdala <b>kindling,</b> may exert long lasting effects on the networks that may prevent the recurrence of <b>kindled</b> seizures. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) {{has been used}} to treat a variety of neurological disorders including epilepsy. However, we have limited knowledge about effective target areas, optimal stimulation parameters, and long-term effect of DBS on epileptic seizures. Here we examined the effects of DBS of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) on amygdala-kindled seizures. Microwire electrodes were implanted into the SNr and amygdala of adult male rats. When stage 5 -kindled seizures were achieved by daily amygdala <b>kindling,</b> high frequency stimulation was delivered to the SNr bilaterally 1 s after cessation of <b>kindling.</b> Our DBS protocol completely blocked <b>kindled</b> seizures in 10 out of 23 (43. 5 %) rats studied. Furthermore, when the same amygdala <b>kindling</b> procedure was performed 24 h later without DBS, the <b>kindling</b> failed to elicit any seizure signs in 6 of these 10 rats. Some of the post-DBS period of seizure suppression lasted for up to 4 days. In other 3 rats, only mild stage 1 to 2 seizures appeared following amygdala <b>kindling.</b> Only I of the 10 rats for which DBS had blocked <b>kindled</b> seizures exhibited full-scale 5 stage-kindled seizures 24 h after DBS. These results suggest that highly plastic neural networks are involved in amygdala-kindled seizures and that DBS, if well timed with the onset of amygdala <b>kindling,</b> may exert long lasting effects on the networks that may prevent the recurrence of <b>kindled</b> seizures.
