40|$|The {{hypothalamic}} feeding-center model, {{articulated in}} the 1950 s, held that the hypothalamus contains the <b>interoceptors</b> sensitive to blood-borne correlates of available or stored fuels {{as well as the}} integrative substrates that process metabolic and visceral afferent signals and issue commands to brainstem mechanisms for the production of ingestive behavior. A number of findings reviewed here, however, indicate that sensory and integrative functions are distributed across a central control axis that includes critical substrates in the basal forebrain {{as well as in the}} caudal brainstem. First, the <b>interoceptors</b> relevant to energy balance are distributed more widely than had been previously thought, with a prominent brainstem complement of leptin and insulin receptors, glucose-sensing mechanisms, and neuropeptide mediators. The physiological relevance of this multiple representation is suggested by the demonstration that similar behavioral effects can be obtained independently by stimulation of respective forebrain and brainstem subpopulations of the same receptor types (e. g., leptin, CRH, and melanocortin). The classical hypothalamic model is also challenged by the integrative achievements of the chronically maintained, supracollicular decerebrate rat. Decerebrat...|$|R

5000|$|In 1906, Charles Scott Sherrington {{published}} a landmark work that introduced the terms [...] "proprioception", [...] "interoception", and [...] "exteroception". The [...] "exteroceptors" [...] are the organs that provide information originating outside the body, {{such as the}} eyes, ears, mouth, and skin. The <b>interoceptors</b> provide information about the internal organs, and the [...] "proprioceptors" [...] provide information about movement derived from muscular, tendon, and articular sources. Using Sherrington's system, physiologists and anatomists search for specialised nerve endings that transmit mechanical data on joint capsule, tendon and muscle tension (such as Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles), which play {{a large role in}} proprioception.|$|R
50|$|Peripheral chemoreceptors (of the carotid and aortic bodies) are {{so named}} because they are sensory {{extensions}} of the peripheral nervous system into blood vessels where they detect changes in chemical concentrations. As transducers of patterns of variability in the surrounding environment, carotid and aortic bodies count as chemosensors {{in a similar way}} as taste buds and photoreceptors. However, because carotid and aortic bodies detect variation within the body’s internal organs, they are considered <b>interoceptors.</b> Taste buds, olfactory bulbs, photoreceptors, and other receptors associated with the five traditional sensory modalities, by contrast, are exteroceptors in that they respond to stimuli outside the body. The body also contains proprioceptors, which respond to the amount of stretch within the organ, usually muscle, that they occupy.|$|R
40|$|Most {{vertebrates}} show respiratory and circulatory reflexes {{which can}} be traced to stimulation of various extero- or <b>interoceptors.</b> Widely distributed groups of exteroceptors, with a variety of stimulus modalities, are associated with defence reflexes which protect the respiratory passages and gas exchange surfaces. Other exteroceptors are associated only with the gas exchange surfaces. These are either mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors and have a range of different dynamic characteristics, but are none-the-less amazingly uniform in their role in control of the normal breathing pattern. Intravascular receptors stimulated by the arterial blood pressure are located on all the gills in fishes, yet appear to be restricted to the pulmocutaneous arteries in anuran amphibians and to the truncal region or aortic root in reptiles and birds. On the other hand, the distribution of glomus-sustentacular-nerve cell complexes, associated with intravascular chemoreception, appears to be much more diffuse in higher than lower vertebrates. The wide distribution of these cell complexes may be attributed to their embryological origin from neural crest cells. Even so, the presence of these complexes {{does not appear to be}} essential for respiratory responses to environmental hypoxia since they have not been located in teleost fishes. The role of peripheral receptors in controlling cardiovascular and respira-tory functions, under steady state conditions in non-mammalian vertebrates, is not well defined and it may be that they are only modulators of circulatory and respiratory patterns arising from hormonal or humoral effects on the central nervous system...|$|R
40|$|We aim to {{summarise}} the impact and mechanisms of work-rate pacing during individual cycling time trials (TTs). Unlike time-to-exhaustion tests, a TT provides an externally valid model for examining how an initial work rate is chosen and maintained by an athlete during self-selected exercise. The selection {{and distribution of}} work rate {{is one of many}} factors that influence cycling speed. Mathematical models are available to predict the impact of factors such as gradient and wind velocity on cycling speed, but only a few researchers have examined the inter-relationships between these factors and work-rate distribution within a TT. When environmental conditions are relatively stable (e. g. in a velodrome) and the TT is > 10 minutes, then an even distribution of work rate is optimal. For a shorter TT (350 watts). During a TT, pacing strategy is regulated in a complex anticipatory system that monitors afferent feedback from various physiological systems, and then regulates the work rate so that potentially limiting changes do not occur before the endpoint of exercise is reached. It is critical that the endpoint of exercise is known by the cyclist so that adjustments to exercise work rate can be made within the context of an estimated finish time. Pacing strategies are thus the consequence of complex regulation and serve a dual role: they are both the result of homeostatic regulation by the brain, as well as being the means by which such regulation is achieved. The pacing strategy 'algorithm' is sited in the brain and would need afferent input from <b>interoceptors,</b> such as heart rate and respiratory rate, as well as exteroceptors providing information on local environmental conditions. Such inputs have been shown to induce activity in the thalamus, hypothalamus and the parietal somatosensory cortex. Knowledge of time, modulated by the cerebellum, basal ganglia and primary somatosensory cortex, would also input to the pacing algorithm as would information stored in memory about previous similar exercise bouts. How all this information is assimilated by the different regions of the brain is not known at present...|$|R
