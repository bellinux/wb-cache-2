5|$|By 1982 16 {{per cent}} of Yorkshire's public houses {{were tied to}} Stones. Bass closed the Cannon Brewery in April 1999 {{with the loss of}} 57 jobs. Bass blamed the closure on the steep decline <b>in</b> <b>sales</b> of cask {{conditioned}} beers (nationally there had been a 14 per cent decline <b>in</b> <b>sales</b> of cask beer over the previous 12 months) which the brewery produced. The brewer realised £1 million in efficiency savings by closing the brewery. The Campaign for Real Ale blamed the brewery's closure on Bass' failure to promote their cask conditioned products. As well as Stones Bitter, the Cannon brewed the small scale Bass Special, Bass Light and Bass Mild brands from the mid-1990s as declining Stones volumes left the brewery with spare capacity. Bass Light and Bass Mild had been sold in the Sheffield area as Stones Mild and Stones Dark Mild respectively.|$|E

5|$|From Russia, with Love was {{released}} in the UK as a hardback on 8 April 1957, by the publishers Jonathan Cape. The American edition was published {{a few weeks later}} by Macmillan. In November 1956 the Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, had visited Fleming's Jamaican Goldeneye estate, to recuperate from a breakdown in his health. This was much reported in the British press, and the publication of From Russia, with Love was accompanied by a promotional campaign that capitalised on Fleming's raised public profile. The serialisation of the story in The Daily Express in 1957 provided a boost to the sales of the book; a bigger rise <b>in</b> <b>sales</b> was to follow four years later. In an article in Life on 17 March 1961, the US President John F. Kennedy listed From Russia, with Love as one of his ten favourite books. This accolade, and its associated publicity, led to a surge <b>in</b> <b>sales</b> that made Fleming the biggest-selling crime writer in the US. There was a further boost to sales following the release of the film of the same name in 1963, which saw the sales of the Pan paperback rise from 145,000 in 1962 to 642,000 in 1963 and 600,000 in 1964.|$|E
