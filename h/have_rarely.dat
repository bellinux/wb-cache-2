5|$|Aberdeen <b>have</b> <b>rarely</b> {{played in}} the same {{division}} as their geographically closest rivals: Peterhead, Brechin City, Montrose, Arbroath, Elgin City, and Forfar Athletic, so rivalries have tended to come from further afield. Currently, Aberdeen have a minor rivalry with Inverness Caley Thistle, {{due to the fact}} both Aberdeen and Inverness are the two largest settlements in the north of Scotland. This is known as the North derby and has arisen since Inverness were first promoted to the SPL in 2004.|$|E
5|$|As the two nearby Manchester clubs <b>have</b> <b>rarely</b> been in {{the same}} {{division}} as Stockport, historically there has been little rivalry with either club. However, the rivalry between Stockport County and Manchester City took form between 1997 and 2002, when the two clubs spent three out of five seasons in the same division and during the 1998/99 season, Stockport were a division above City.|$|E

5|$|Bolton's main rivals {{historically}} {{have been with}} near neighbours Bury, though this has lessened since the Second World War as the two clubs <b>have</b> <b>rarely</b> {{been in the same}} league. The club also has a rivalry with Blackburn Rovers, as the two sides are separated by just fifteen miles and are both founder members of the Football League. More recently, Bolton have developed an enmity with Wigan Athletic, whose fans generally regard Bolton as their main rivals. Bolton fans maintain a mutual dislike with the fans of Tranmere Rovers, Burnley, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E
5|$|In recent decades, {{pitchers}} <b>have</b> <b>rarely</b> won the award. When Justin Verlander won the AL {{award in}} 2011, {{he became the}} first pitcher in either league to be named the MVP since Dennis Eckersley in 1992. Verlander also became the first starting pitcher to win this award since Roger Clemens had accomplished the feat in 1986. The National League went even longer without an MVP award to a pitcher—after Bob Gibson won in 1968, no pitcher in that league was named MVP until Clayton Kershaw in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, with its {{significant}} rainfall, wildfires {{are relatively small}} and <b>have</b> <b>rarely</b> posed great risk to life and property. As white settlements moved further west into drier areas, the first large scale fires were encountered. Range fires on the Great Plains and forest fires in the Rocky Mountains were far larger and more destructive than what had ever {{been seen in the}} east. A number of catastrophic fire events over the years greatly influenced fire management policies.|$|E

5|$|Like {{almost any}} herbivore, they consume other plants if {{presented}} with them, but their diet in nature consists {{almost entirely of}} grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. Hippos are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mothers' feces to digest vegetation. Hippos <b>have</b> (<b>rarely)</b> been filmed eating carrion, usually close to the water. There are other reports of meat-eating, and even cannibalism and predation. The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by aberrant behaviour or nutritional stress.|$|E
5|$|The courts <b>have</b> <b>rarely</b> treated {{content-based}} {{regulation of}} journalism with any sympathy. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974), the Court unanimously {{struck down a}} state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses. The state claimed that the law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility. The Supreme Court found that freedom, but not responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish.|$|E
5|$|The rectors {{were almost}} all royal favourites or up-and-coming ecclesiastical leaders, who would <b>have</b> <b>rarely</b> visited the church. Perhaps {{the most notable}} of the rectors at this time was Antony Bek, who held the living from 1277–84. He was brother to Thomas Bek, bishop of St David’s 1280–93. Antony Bek became bishop of Durham and Patriarch of Jerusalem, but was more noted as a warrior than for his piety.|$|E

5|$|Further afield, {{the club}} has a rivalry with Bristol City, known as the Severnside derby, {{and to a lesser}} extent, Bristol Rovers. There is also a lesser rivalry with Welsh {{neighbours}} Newport County due to the proximity of the two Welsh cities. However, they <b>have</b> <b>rarely</b> played against each another since the 1980s due to Cardiff being in higher leagues. In total they have only ever played 20 football league games against each other. A survey by Football Fans Census in 2003 saw Swansea, Bristol City and Newport listed as Cardiff's main three rivalries, with Stoke City matching Newport in third.|$|E
5|$|Millwall's fiercest rival is West Ham United. It {{is one of}} {{the most}} passionately contested local derbies in football. The two clubs <b>have</b> <b>rarely</b> met in recent years due to them playing in {{different}} leagues; the majority of their meetings happened before the First World War, with some 60 meetings between 1899–1915. The clubs have played 99 times since the first contest in 1899. Millwall have won 38, drawn 27 and lost 34. Despite violence between the two sets of supporters and calls for future games between the clubs to be played behind closed doors, they last met in the Football League Championship in 2011–12 with no outright ban on either set of fans, and no repeat of crowd trouble. The rivalry between the sides, specifically the clubs' two hooligan firms has been depicted on the big screen several times, in films such as Green Street.|$|E
5|$|The cheetah, {{especially}} {{mothers with}} young cubs, are highly vigilant; {{they need to}} remain on a lookout for large carnivores who might steal the prey or harm the cubs, and for any potential prey. In Africa, the cheetah will surrender its kill to sturdier carnivores such as lions, leopards, spotted and brown hyenas, and wild dogs. Cheetahs lose around 10 to 15% of their kills to other predators; the percentage {{was found to be}} as high as 50% in a 1986 study. Cheetahs <b>have</b> <b>rarely</b> been observed to feed on the kills of other carnivores; {{this may be due to}} vultures and spotted hyena adroitly capturing and consuming heavy carcasses within a short time. In Eurasia, in the past, the cheetah's range overlapped not just with those of the lion, leopard and hyena, but also other carnivores, such as the tiger, wolf and bear.|$|E

5|$|The meat, blubber, baleen, and oil of baleen whales have {{traditionally}} {{been used by the}} indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for these products, cetaceans are now protected by international law. However, the North Atlantic right whale is ranked critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, baleen whales also face threats from marine pollution and ocean acidification. It has been speculated that man-made sonar results in strandings. They <b>have</b> <b>rarely</b> been kept in captivity, and this has only been attempted with juveniles or members of one of the smallest species.|$|E
5|$|While {{defended by}} those {{cultures}} {{in which it}} constitutes a tradition, FGC is opposed by many medical and cultural organizations {{on the grounds that}} it is unnecessary and harmful. Short term health effects may include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, and even result in death, while long term effects include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, vaginitis and cystitis. In addition FGC leads to complications with pregnancy, labor and delivery. Reversal (defibulation) by skilled personnel may be required to open the scarred tissue. Amongst those opposing the practice are local grassroots groups, and national and international organisations including WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and Amnesty International. Legislative efforts to ban FGC <b>have</b> <b>rarely</b> been successful and the preferred approach is education and empowerment and the provision of information about the adverse health effects as well the human rights aspects.|$|E
