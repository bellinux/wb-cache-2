6000|$|It may {{not seem}} easy to {{understand}} this; but I will explain what I mean by an example. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> that in earthly matters we must stoop to conquer; we must obey the laws which God has given to anything, before we can master and use that thing. And in matters about our own soul--about our behaviour to God--about our behaviour to our fellow-men, believe me {{there is no rule}} like the golden one of Lord Verulam's--stoop to conquer--obey if you wish to rule. For see now. What is there more common than this? It happens to each of us every day. We meet a fellow- man our equal, neither better nor worse than ourselves, and we want to make him do something. Now there are two ways in which we may set about that. We may drive our man, or we may lead him. You know well enough which of those two ways is likely to succeed best. If you try to drive the man, you say to yourself, [...] "I know I am right. I see the thing in this light, and he is a fool if he does not see it in the same light. I choose to have the thing done, and done it shall be, and if he is stupid enough not to take my view of it, I will let him know who I am, and we will see which of us is the stronger!" [...] So says many a man in his heart. But what comes of it? Nothing. For the other man gets angry, and determines to have his way in his turn. There is a quarrel {{and a great deal of}} noise; and most probably the thing is not done. Instead of the man getting what he wants, he has a fresh quarrel on his hands, and nothing more. So his blustering is no sign that he is really strong. For the strong man is the man who can get what he wants done. Is he not? Surely we shall all agree to that. And the proud, hot, positive, dictatorial, self-willed man is just the man, in a free country like this, who does not get what he wants done. He will not stoop--therefore he will not conquer.|$|E

For this ought, the question of what I ought to do seems just to be the question of what to do Let’s experiment, then, with accepting this suggestion. It commits us to something of theoretical import. The answer to an ought question is a state-ment; I can state this: I ought to speak loudly enough in public that people can hear. If I settle what to do, though, I voice my conclusion not with a statement, but with something like an imperative: “Speak audibly, ” I migh...|$|E

The circumstances of the apparition are so similar to those <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that it would only bore you if I repeated them.

6000|$|As {{soon as the}} two {{brothers}} were at liberty to speak together privately, Henry explained the motive which had led to his strange inquiries about the bedrooms. Francis had informed him of the meeting with the Countess at Venice, and of all that had followed it; and Henry now carefully repeated the narrative to his brother in all its details. 'I am not satisfied,' he added, 'about that woman's purpose in giving up her room.

The true law of bas-relief is to begin with a depth of incision proportioned justly to the distance of the observer and the character of the subject, and out of that rationally determined depth, neither increased for ostentation of effect, nor diminished for ostentation of skill, to do the utmost that will be easily visible to an observer, supposing him to give an average human amount of attention, but not to peer into, or critically scrutinize the work.|$|R

60|$|The Americans {{are not a}} shoving people, {{like their}} cousins the English. Their fault in this {{particular}} lies in a morbid pride, with a stubbornness that {{is the result of}} a limited experience, and which is too apt to induce them to set up their own provincial notions, as the standard, and to throw them backward into the intrenchments, of self-esteem. This feeling is peculiarly fostered by the institutions. It is easy to err in this manner; and it is precisely the failing of the countryman, everywhere, when he first visits town. It is, in fact, the fault of ignorance of the world. By referring to what <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> it will be seen that these are the very propensities which will be the most likely to make one uncomfortable in Europe, where so much of the initiative of intercourse is thrown upon the shoulders of the stranger.|$|R
6000|$|One meets, here, with droll evidences of {{the truth}} of what <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> have made the {{acquaintance}} of a Russian of very illustrious family, and he has always been loud and constant in his eulogiums of America and her liberty. Alluding to the subject, the other day, he amused me by naïvely observing, [...] "Ah, you are a happy people--you are free--and so are the English. Now, in Russia, all rank depends on the commission one bears in the army, or on the will of the Emperor. I am a Prince; my father was a Prince; my grandfather, too; but it is of no avail. I get no privileges by my birth; whereas, in England, where I have been, it is so different--And I dare say it is different in America, too?"

Amelius! my poor darling was born with my deformity--and I {{want you to know}} exactly what it is, because neither you nor I can say what reason for remembering it there may not be in the future." [...] She stopped, as if to give him an {{opportunity}} of speaking. A man shallow and flippant by nature might have seen the disclosure in a grotesque aspect. Amelius was sad and silent. [...] "I like you better and better," [...] she went on. [...] "You are not like the common run of men. Nine out of ten of them would have turned what <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> into a joke--nine out of ten would have said, 'Am I to ask every girl I meet to show me her left foot?' You are above that; you understand me. Have I no means of recognizing my own child, now?" ...|$|R

I own that I do not see that she is {{altogether}} to blame, but it is a most unfortunate occurrence. As <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> she had, when she put the children to bed, put your child in one of her baby's night-gowns, as it happened there were none of your child's clean. In the morning she took them out and laid them on a rug on the ground before beginning to wash and dress them. She went out to the canteen to get something for her husband's breakfast, and when she returned she could not remember the order in which she had taken them out of bed and laid them down, and could not distinguish her own child from yours." ...|$|R

She saw laboratory equipment {{for the first time}} while studying towards her degree at Vista University in Soweto, which is now part of the University of Johannesburg. Buyisiwe graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Physics, Chemistry and Statistics.|$|R

[...] "It is felony, as <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> for a Roman Catholic priest to celebrate a marriage which may be lawfully celebrated by a parochial clergyman, a Presbyterian mini ster, and a Non-conformist minister. It is also felony (by another law) {{on the part of}} a parochial clergyman to celebrate a marriage that may be lawfully celebrated by a Roman Catholic priest. And it is again felony (by yet another law) for a Presbyterian minister and a Non-conformist minister to celebrate a marriage which may be lawfully celebrated by a clergyman of the Established Church. An odd state of things. Foreigners might possibly think it a scandalous state of things. In this country we don't appear to mind it. Returning to the present case, the results stand thus: Mr. Vanborough is a single man; Mrs. Vanborough is a single woman; their child is illegitimate, and the priest, Ambrose Redman, is liable to be tried, and punished, as a felon, for marrying them." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{seven days}} I hurried on, resting {{only when the}} {{darkness}} stopped me, and living chiefly upon cocoanuts, which afforded me both meat and drink, and on the eighth day I reached the seashore and saw a party of white men gathering pepper, which grew abundantly all about. Reassured {{by the nature of}} their occupation, I advanced towards them and they greeted me in Arabic, asking who I was and whence I came. My delight was great on hearing this familiar speech, and I willingly satisfied their curiosity, telling them how I had been shipwrecked, and captured by the blacks. [...] "But these savages devour men!" [...] said they. [...] "How did you escape?" [...] I repeated to them what <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> at which they were mightily astonished. I stayed with them until they had collected as much pepper as they wished, and then they took me back to their own country and presented me to their king, by whom I was hospitably received. To him also I had to relate my adventures, which surprised him much, and when I had finished he ordered that I should be supplied with food and raiment and treated with consideration.|$|R

[...] "If you leave me, Sir Percival, after what you have just heard, you do not leave me to marry another man, you only allow me to remain a single woman {{for the rest of}} my life. My fault towards you has begun and ended in my own thoughts. It can never go any farther.

At the time, Berle was discussing the emotional fallout from an experience {{he had with}} impregnating a woman he was not married to, and having {{to decide whether or}} not they would keep the child. During his talk, Pryor let out a laugh, to which Berle took exception and confronted him, stating, [...] "I wish, I wish, Richard, that I could have laughed at that time at your age, when I was your age, the way you just laughed now, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> couldn't... <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> this nine years ago, and now I'll tell you on the air in front of millions of people: Pick your spots, baby."

I have already <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that my {{stepfather}} made an attempt to discover me some years after I had turned my back on the Scotch school. He took that step out of no anxiety of his own, but simply as the agent of my father's trustees. In the exercise of their discretion, they had sold the estates in Barbadoes (at the time of the emancipation of the slaves, and the ruin of West Indian property) for what the estates would fetch. Having invested the proceeds, they were bound to set aside a sum for my yearly education. This responsibility obliged them to make the attempt to trace me--a fruitless attempt, as you already know. A little later (as I have been since informed) I was publicly addressed by an advertisement in the newspapers, which I never saw. Later still, when I was twenty-one, a second advertisement appeared (which I did see) offering a reward for evidence of my death. If I was alive, I had a right to my half share of the proceeds of the estates on coming of age; if dead, the money reverted to my mother. I went to the lawyers, and heard from them what <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> After some difficulty in proving my identity--and after an interview with my stepfather, and a message from my mother, which has hopelessly widened the old breach between us--my claim was allowed; and my money is now invested for me in the funds, under the name that is really my own." ...|$|R
