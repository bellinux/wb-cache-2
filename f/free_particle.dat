25|$|In {{scattering}} theory, the S-matrix is {{an operator}} mapping <b>free</b> <b>particle</b> in-states to <b>free</b> <b>particle</b> out-states (scattering channels) in the Heisenberg picture. This is very useful because often we cannot describe the interaction (at least, {{not the most}} interesting ones) exactly.|$|E
25|$|For this viewpoint, {{one should}} {{consider}} how the archetypical scattering experiment is performed. The initial particles are prepared in well defined states where they are so far apart that they don't interact. They are somehow made to interact, and the final particles are registered when they are so far apart that they have ceased to interact. The idea {{is to look for}} states in the Heisenberg picture that in the distant past had the appearance of <b>free</b> <b>particle</b> states. This will be the in states. Likewise, an out state will be a state that in the distant future has the appearance of a <b>free</b> <b>particle</b> state.|$|E

25|$|The {{systematic}} {{treatment of}} the dynamic behavior of interconnected bodies {{has led to a}} large number of important multibody formalisms in the field of mechanics. The simplest bodies or elements of a multibody system were treated by Newton (<b>free</b> <b>particle)</b> and Euler (rigid body). Euler introduced reaction forces between bodies. Later, a series of formalisms were derived, only to mention Lagrange’s formalisms based on minimal coordinates and a second formulation that introduces constraints.|$|E
25|$|Here a {{slightly}} more rigorous approach is taken {{in order to address}} potential problems that were disregarded in the interaction picture approach of above. The final outcome is, of course, the same as when taking the quicker route. For this, the notions of in and out states are needed.

40|$|An easy-to-implement {{technique}} for pool {{boiling heat transfer}} enhancement is proposed and evaluated through an experimental investigation. This free-particle technique brings about nucleate boiling at a low degree of superheat by means of metal particles that are not fixed to the heated surface, but rather are free to move {{with respect to the}} surface. The effects of copper particles with sizes ranging from tens of nanometers to 9 mm on nucleate boiling heat transfer and critical heat flux (CHF) of the wetting dielectric fluid FC- 72 are investigated. Visualizations of the bubble nucleation characteristics due to the <b>free</b> <b>particles</b> are presented. Experimental results show that the introduction of microscale <b>free</b> <b>particles</b> onto a superheated surface effectively facilitates bubble nucleation and thus increases the nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficients. Millimeter-sized as well as nanoscale <b>free</b> <b>particles</b> do not have a strong effect on the boiling heat transfer performance of this wetting fluid. Introduction of a large quantity of microscale <b>free</b> <b>particles</b> reduces CHF by increasing the resistance to liquid replenishment and vapor departure; however, by properly selecting particle size and quantity, an improvement in both nucleate boiling heat transfer and CHF is observed. For the case where 0. 2 g of 10 μm-diameter <b>free</b> <b>particles</b> are placed on a polished copper surface, corresponding to a particle layer thickness of approximately 67 μm, the average nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficient is enhanced by 76. 3 % over the heat flux range of 10 to 159 kW/m 2, while CHF is increased by 10 %...|$|R
25|$|It {{is useful}} to compare the {{situation}} to the classical case. In both cases, the particle behaves as a <b>free</b> <b>particle</b> outside of the barrier region. A classical particle with energy E larger than the barrier height V0 will be slowed down but never reflected by the barrier, while a classical particle with E < V0 incident on the barrier from the left would always be reflected.

25|$|For the Klein–Gordon {{equation}}, {{the general}} {{form of the}} Schrödinger equation is inconvenient to use, and in practice the Hamiltonian is not expressed in an analogous way to the Dirac Hamiltonian. The equations for relativistic quantum fields can be obtained in other ways, such as starting from a Lagrangian density and using the Euler–Lagrange equations for fields, or use the representation theory of the Lorentz group in which certain representations {{can be used to}} fix the equation for a <b>free</b> <b>particle</b> of given spin (and mass).|$|E
25|$|Wave {{functions}} {{change as}} time progresses. The Schrödinger equation describes how wave functions change in time, {{playing a role}} similar to Newton's second law in classical mechanics. The Schrödinger equation, applied to the aforementioned example of the <b>free</b> <b>particle,</b> predicts that {{the center of a}} wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity (like a classical particle with no forces acting on it). However, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more uncertain with time. This also has the effect of turning a position eigenstate (which {{can be thought of as}} an infinitely sharp wave packet) into a broadened wave packet that no longer represents a (definite, certain) position eigenstate.|$|E
40|$|The mean {{arrival time}} of <b>free</b> <b>particles</b> is {{computed}} using the quantum probability current.

Since the Dirac probability current involves a spin-dependent term, an {{arrival time distribution}} based on the probability current shows an observable spin-dependent effect, even for <b>free</b> <b>particles.</b> This arises essentially from relativistic quantum dynamics, but persists even in the non-relativistic regime.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is shown that exact {{decoherence}} to minimal uncertainty Gaussian pointer states is generic for <b>free</b> quantum <b>particles</b> coupled to a heat bath.

500|$|In 1935, Vladimir Fock {{showed that}} the quantum {{mechanical}} bound Kepler problem {{is equivalent to the}} problem of a <b>free</b> <b>particle</b> confined to a three-dimensional unit sphere in four-dimensional space. [...] Specifically, Fock {{showed that the}} Schrödinger wavefunction in the momentum space for the Kepler problem was the stereographic projection of the spherical harmonics on the sphere. [...] Rotation of the sphere and reprojection results in a continuous mapping of the elliptical orbits without changing the energy; quantum mechanically, this corresponds to a mixing of all orbitals of the same energy quantum number n. [...] Valentine Bargmann noted subsequently that the Poisson brackets for the angular momentum vector L and the scaled LRL vector D formed the Lie algebra for SO(4). [...] Simply put, the six quantities D and L correspond to the six conserved angular momenta in four dimensions, associated with the six possible simple rotations in that space (there are six ways of choosing two axes from four).
