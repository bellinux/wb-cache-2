25|$|The balance {{consisted}} of a circular steel balance wheel with two bimetallic strips attached diametrically. Each bimetallic strip terminated with a screw thread mounted with a weight or balance nut. The further along the strip this nut was screwed, the greater the compensating effect. Another part of the patent concerned an addition to {{the form of the}} balance springâ€”a coil of smaller radius {{at each end of the}} <b>helical</b> <b>spring,</b> which offered increasing resistance to the rotating balance as it turned towards the end of each vibration. This was an important invention, as it largely eliminated the problem of the positional adjustment of balance controlled watches. This device, known as the Overcoil balance spring is still used today in most precision mechanical watches.|$|E

The element transfer matrix used in the solution is calculated using the Scaling and Squaring method and Pad'e approximations. Three examples are presented for three types of springs with different cross-sectional shapes under clamped-clamped boundary condition. The accuracy of the proposed method has been compared with the FEM results using three-dimensional solid elements (Solid 45) in ANSYS code.

2500|$|A Slinky or [...] "Lazy Spring" [...] is a toy {{consisting}} of a <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> that stretches and can bounce up and down. It can perform a number of tricks, including traveling {{down a flight of}} steps end-over-end as it stretches and re-forms itself with the aid of gravity and its own momentum. The Slinky was invented in 1943 by American engineer Richard T. James while working in his home laboratory to invent a set of springs {{that could be used to}} support sensitive instruments on board ships and stabilize them even in rough seas. When he once accidentally knocked one of his springs off a shelf, James saw that, rather than flopping in a heap onto the floor, the spring [...] "stepped" [...] in a series of arcs from the shelf, to a stack of books, to a tabletop, to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. In 1945, the James first exhibited his new toy at the Gimbels, a department store located in Philadelphia. He sold 400 Slinkys in 90 minutes which was the start of a sensation that continues to this day.|$|E

This thesis investigates the energy absorption of a multi-body system impacted by a suddenly contracting pretensioned <b>helical</b> extension <b>spring.</b> The system {{consists of a}} <b>helical</b> extension <b>spring</b> and other common components used in a consumer application. Impact tests were performed on the system with varying input energies; resulting damage included plastic and brittle failure. Impact tests were also performed on individual components from the system to characterize {{the amount of energy}} each component absorbed given a specific energy input. Component models were created by carrying out regression analysis on the results from each of the components, including the <b>helical</b> extension <b>spring.</b> Through inverse prediction, component models were used to determine the amount of energy each component absorbed during system tests. System models were created, estimating the amount of energy transfered from the <b>helical</b> extension <b>spring</b> to each of the components in the system. Further analysis of the data from a prior study on the energy absorption of <b>helical</b> extension <b>springs</b> was also conducted. The energy absorption models developed in this thesis provide an understanding of the energy being absorbed in the system due to an impact event. The system models predicted energy absorption between 88 and 120 percent of the initial potential energy stored in the <b>helical</b> extension <b>spring.</b> Energy absorptions of over 100 percent indicate that the component models have over-predicted the amount of energy actually absorbed.

Recently, multiaxial loading has become more common-place, with devices such as flexible shaft couplings. Through static mechanical experiments, coupled with finite element analysis, the equivalent stress distribution in uniformly deformed springs is developed based solely upon visual inspection of the bent helix. Equivalent strains are also approximated, with satisfactory correlation between predicted and observed strains. In situations that involve space constraints, stress monitoring equipment may be intrusive; as such, approximations have been based solely on visual inspection of the deformed helix...|$|R
