The main drivers of public health spending are income growth, insurance coverage, demographics, and, above all, technological change. According to the projections of the major international institutions (European Commission, OECD, International Monetary Fund), public health spending for the of EU- 15 countries could significantly increase by 2050. These projections vary in an extremely wide range, between + 27 % and + 84 %, depending on the assumptions made. However, the big challenge will be the growth of public spending on long-term care which could more than double over the 2010 - 2050 period, owing to the sharp rise of frailty and disability at older ages, especially amongst the very old (aged 80 +) which will be the fastest growing segment of the EU population in the decades to come.

The project took the form of five case-studies, set in schools which each had well established pastoral strategies in place. The schools plans and policies were influenced by contexts of State and Federal education programmes, by the community setting of each school, by community concerns, and by other priorities within the school itself. In the study, information was collected through interviews and written responses from school staff, through documentary evidence of plans and policies for pastoral care, and through the observation of meetings which related to pastoral concerns. The study found that each school had complex structures in place which were resource intensive and which were designed to deliver pastoral care. The basis of those structures rested upon the presumption that pastoral care delivery took place at classroom level, particularly in Form classes. Findings suggested that such delivery was adversely affected by time constraints, and by deficiencies in pre-service and in-service training For teachers in the area of pastoral care. The services of specialists in the schools had decreased due to <b>expenditure</b> <b>restraints,</b> at a time of increased pastoral demands.

Nakon analize autor zaključuje da je u promatranom razdoblju nesumnjivo bio prisutan proces restrukturiranja u prerađivačkoj industriji Hrvatske, a dobici u rastu proizvodnosti rada proizlazili su najvećim dijelom iz racionalizacije broja zaposlenih. Increase of {{competitiveness}} {{on the world}} market and growth of exports are significant signs of success in the process of restructuring in the post-socialist economies. In Croatia, however, exports (of goods) were explicitly stagnant in the entire period 1999 - 2000. In this paper various factors are investigated which can be responsible for such an outcome. Attention is aimed at: costs of production and profitability of firms in manufacturing industry, features of investments, development of small and medium size enterprises and foreign-exchange regime. Author comes to the conclusion that process of restructuring in manufacturing industry in Croatia was present in the period under observation. However, given low investment activity, gains in productivity were obtained mainly as a result of reduction in the redundant labor force. A rise in costs triggered by introduction of the VATsystem and subsequent expansion of public expenditure in 1998, as well as new costs stemming from an explosion of arrears in 1999, have not been offset by analogous decrease in the unit labor cost. At the same time, due to high liberalization of imports and de facto fixed foreign-exchange regime and consequent overvaluation of domestic currency, highstability of prices was sustained. In such circumstances losses in the firms in manufacturing industry were continuously present, being in some years more than twofold greater than profits. Conclusion is that the fixed foreign-exchange regime should be abandoned and a kind of a crawling band with asymmetric interventions should be adopted. With a support of an appropriate monetary and wage policy and further efforts for public <b>expenditure</b> <b>restraints,</b> competitiveness of Croatian exports {{on the world market}} could be enhanced...|$|R

40|$|The {{future of}} public {{healthcare}} systems between universalism and sustainability Over {{the past thirty}} years, health expenditure has grown {{at a faster rate}} than the economy in almost every OECD country. The main drivers of public health spending are income growth, insurance coverage, demographics, and, above all, technological change. According to the projections of the major international institutions (European Commission, OECD, International Monetary Fund), public health spending for the of EU countries could significantly increase by 2050. These projections vary in an extremely wide range, between + 40 % and + 70 %, depending on the assumptions made. However, the big challenge will be the growth of public spending on long-term care which could more than double over the 2010 - 2050 period, owing to the sharp rise of frailty and disability at older ages, especially amongst the very old (aged 80 +) which will be the fastest growing segment of the EU population in the decades to come. The European countries are facing a common challenge: the need to secure the economic and financial sustainability of their healthcare systems without undermining the values of universal coverage and solidarity in financing. Command and control policies aimed at <b>expenditure</b> <b>restraints</b> and largely operating through regulatory controls (controls over inputs and wages, budget caps, etc.) are widely used during periods of recession. They can hold expenditures down in the short term. However, they do little or nothing to moderate the underlying pressures which push health spending up over the long-run. Other policies to guarantee both economic and financial sustainability in the long-run should be explored: a) the adoption of new regulation tools on supply and demand side; b) a new balanced mix of public and private financing, strengthening the role of supplementary private health insurance (PHI), to allow investment and innovation, without imposing unsustainable burdens on public budgets and without denying care to the disadvantaged. The former policies focus on economic sustainability, improving the way health systems address the rise in chronic disease and seek to incentive and reward patients, providers and buyers for healthy behaviour, quality and efficiency of care. The latter policies could ensure long-term financial stability of the health care systemsbut may determine negative effects in terms of equity. Therefore, they must be carefully designed (e. g., better supplementary rather than duplicate or complementary PHI; better group than individual PHI coverage) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} {{produced}} to quantify performance indicators for selected enforced driver behaviours (drink driving, speeding and restraint use) in South Australia for the calendar year 2006. The level of random breath testing (RBT) in South Australia in 2006 increased by 7 per cent to its highest ever level. The detection rate based on evidentiary testing decreased in 2006 {{from the previous}} year but remained at a relatively high level, while the detection rate for screening tests increased to the highest level since recording commenced in 2003. There was an increase in the proportion of tests conducted using mobile RBT, which is due to the operation of unrestricted mobile RBT for the entire year for the first time. Detection rates in South Australia were comparable with those in other states. There was an increase (7 %) in the number of hours spent on speed detection in 2006 compared to 2005, partly due to three months of speed camera inactivity in 2005. Apart from an increase in speed camera detections, red light/speed camera detections also increased (by 30 %) in 2006, most likely due to the expansion of the program. The detection rate (per hour of enforcement and per 1, 000 vehicles passing speed cameras) increased {{for the first time since}} 2001 but remained at a relatively low level. No urban speed surveys were conducted in 2006 but rural surveys revealed a decrease in travel speeds on rural roads. The number of restraint offences in 2006 was 13 per cent higher than the number in 2005. Males were charged with more restraint offences and were more likely to be unrestrained in fatal and serious injury crashes than females, indicating that males remain an important target for <b>restraint</b> enforcement.

The analysis shows that private savings {{can be expected to}} grow gradually as a result of rising per capita income, falling dependency burden, improved financial deepening, and macro stability. Bivariate causality tests between GNP and savings show that GNP causes both domestic and public savings. However, the causality test is inconclusive in the case of causation between GNP and private savings. This finding has important policy implication in the sense that once a virtual cycle succeeds in accelerating growth, saving would catch up with a lag. In this sense, financing of investment is not a major constraint. The paper underlines the following policy options: (i) a strong effort spread over tax policy (tax reforms as well as tax administration), <b>expenditure</b> <b>restraint,</b> effective expenditure management, and public sector corporate reforms should aim at raising public savings to about 6 percent of the GDP; (ii) the incentives for private savings in Pakistan need to be revamped. ...|$|E

Using a new fiscal dataset for small states, this paper analyzes the link between country size, government size, debt, and economic performance. It finds that on average small states have larger governments and higher public debt. Although there are intrinsic factors that explain why governments are bigger in small states, those with smaller governments and lower public debt tend to grow faster and are less vulnerable. Large fiscal adjustments, primarily through <b>expenditure</b> <b>restraint,</b> can underpin growth, although sometimes other elements can also impact. Since better governance is associated with lower debt, fiscal adjustment should be supported b...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine how sub-central governments respond to {{significant}} changes in their grant allocations. We focus on the reactions of State, Regional and Local governments in fifteen countries {{over a period of}} 20 to 30 years to significant exogenous increases and decreases in their grant allocations. We observe that when grants are cut, sub-central governments respond by cutting spending on their wage bill and, disproportionately, on capital expenditure. Therefore, while centrally imposed cuts do result in <b>expenditure</b> <b>restraint</b> at the sub-central level, the composition of the adjustment appears to suffer from short-termism. In addition, our results suggest that sub-central politicians seek to further defend current spending programs by significantly increasing local/regional taxation. In contrast, during periods of significant expansions in grants, these revenues remain constant with {{the full extent of the}} grants increase passed on to current expenditures. Taken together these two results imply a kind of asymmetric 'fly-paper' effect. Finally, we trace the different responses of governments according to their degree of expenditure decentralisation and tax and borrowing autonomy...|$|E
40|$|The South European {{countries}} have been extensively affected by the financial crisis which is followed by austerity measures and public <b>expenditure</b> <b>restraint,</b> especially for social policies. It is well-known that in the countries that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has become the financial supervisor, because of the extensive economic problems that they encounter, the implementing fiscal adjustment measures concentrate on {{the reduction of the}} expenditure and as a result, at the retrenchment of the services provided by the welfare state. Since the onset of the financial crisis, data show that the most affected socioeconomic groups are the middle and especially the vulnerable. It is true that the reduction of the spending for social benefits and services has not yet been associated with an increase in the effectiveness of the social services and as a consequence, the impact on the society is severe. This paper aims at examining the alternatives, from a welfare culture perspective, which can offer viable solutions to the process of reforming the welfare state policies in order to become sustainable while promoting the notion of social solidarity and responsibility...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine sub-central {{government}} fiscal policy during periods when their grant allocations are cut. Existing empirical studies of sub-central fiscal policy {{tend to be}} restricted to analysis of individual countries. In this paper we examine a cross-country dataset spanning 14 OECD countries. We employ event study analysis to obtain {{a description of the}} behavior of sub-central fiscal policy during periods of fiscal squeeze instigated by central government. We show that the dominant sub-central response is to adjust expenditure rather than to offset grant cuts by raising ‘own ’ revenues. We are able to demonstrate that these spending cuts tend to be focused on the sub-central governements ' wage bill, social transfers and, disproportionately, on capital expenditure. Even in countries that in principle have greater flexibility to offset the centrally imposed cuts through a relatively high degree of revenue autonomy we show that they tend not to exercise the option. In summary, centrally imposed grant cuts result in <b>expenditure</b> <b>restraint</b> at the sub-central level, but the adjustment appears to be focused disproportionately on capital spending and hence we argue that the induced adjustment suffers from short-termism...|$|E

Fiscal and structural reforms are needed for the FSM to achieve self-sufficiency. The large government sector will be increasingly unsustainable given coming declines in grants. Fiscal adjustment will need to comprise both expenditure cuts and revenue measures. Structural reform priorities should include improvements to the legal framework for land use, foreign investment, and lending.
