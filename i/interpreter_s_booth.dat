This so-called ‘boom’ of interest in surfing amongst women in Britain is an important topic for feminist analysis. In its contemporary form, the sport has particularly strong links to standards of white heteronormativity, and the heterosexy image of the 'surfer girl' is a central aspect of surfing's commercial mainstreaming. At the same time, surfing is still a relatively ‘new', and so-called 'alternative' sporting space, particularly amongst women in Britain.

40|$|Luminous extragalactic masers are {{traditionally}} {{referred to as}} the `megamasers'. Those produced by water molecules are associated with accretion disks, radio jets, or outflows in the nuclear regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The majority of OH maser sources are instead driven by intense star formation in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, although in a few cases the OH maser emission traces rotating (toroidal or disk) structures around the nuclear engines of AGN. Thus, detailed maser studies provide a fundamental contribution to our knowledge of the main nuclear components of AGN, constitute unique tools to measure geometric distances of host galaxies, and have a great impact on probing the, so far, paradigmatic Unified Model of AGN.

40|$|The {{election}} of the Conservative Government in 1979 heralded a diversion from the post-war, Keynesian public policy model which envisaged incrementally expanding, centrally-funded service provision (Hall, 1988). Largely in response to mounting financial crises, and building on earlier managerialist initiatives (eg. Griffiths, 1983), a new public sector management paradigm began to emerge {{at the beginning of}} the 1990 <b>s</b> (<b>Booth,</b> 1993). This new paradigm, which was informed by the New Right's ‘public choice theory’ emphasised: fiscal re-organisation, privatisation, the separation of purchaser and provider roles within quasi-markets and the sovereignty of the customer (Butler and Vaile, 1991; Thompson, 1992). These ideological and structural changes are now recognised as a significant break with the past (Fitzgerald, 1993), and even John Major acknowledges the programme as a ‘revolution in progress’ (Major, 1989 : 1). Importantly, the reformers have often ritualistically, cast aside traditional, public sector and professional values (Pollitt, 1990 a; Hood, 1991). In their place, a diffuse set of management ideas have been imported from the private sector. These have subsequently been aggregated and termed the “New Public Management” by commentators such as Harrow and Wilcocks (1990) and Steward and Walsh (1992) ...|$|R

40|$|To be literate in Chinese, {{one needs}} to learn over a {{thousand}} Chinese characters. This is obviously a challenging task for young learners. Psychological and developmental studies have provided evidence that awareness of structural regularities among the characters is important for its learning. Yet how this structural awareness can be enhanced in instruction is still not clear. Some worry that any explicit instruction about structures might actually increase the cognitive burden of the young learners, as they might be asked to think analytically about the characters, or to learn a meta-language that describes the structural principles underlying Chinese character composition. This paper discusses the nature of structural awareness in light of Gurtwitsch’s general theory of awareness [Gurwitsch, A. (1964). The Field of consciousness. Pittsburgh: Duguesne University Press] and the theory of variation by Marton and <b>S.</b> <b>Booth</b> [(1997) Learning and awareness. Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum] and F. Marton and A.

It discusses how {{information and communication technologies}} can be used to provide useful support for this purpose. These ideas are implemented in a school–university collaboration project in Hong Kong and anecdotal evidence supports the conjecture of the authors. The structural awareness instruction can also be embedded naturally into meaningful language learning contexts to form an integrative model of teaching that is well received by teachers and students. The instruction does not appear to impose any additional cognitive load on the students. On the contrary, learners’ interest and sensitivity in picking up the structural features of Chinese characters increases...|$|R

40|$|The balloon borne {{cryogenic}} heterodyne spectrometer TELIS allows {{limb sounding}} of the Earth's atmosphere within the submillimeter and far-infrared spectral range. The instrument {{was developed by}} a consortium of major European institutes that includes the Space Research Organisation of the Netherlands (SRON), the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in the United Kingdom and the Deutsche Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) in Germany (lead institute). TELIS offers three channels (450 - 650 GHz, 499 - 503 GHz, 1. 79 – 1. 870 THz) and utilises state-of-the-art superconducting heterodyne technology [1]. As a spectrometer a 3 -level autocorrelator with complex I-Q-sampling technique is used. It offers the advantage of low energy consumption, being light weight and has a resolution better than 2. 5 MHz. A similar spectrometer without I-Q-technique has been successfully used on the ODIN satellite [2]. During gas cell characterisation measurements of the TELIS autocorrelator spectrometer however, discrepancies occurred between measured and expected spectra. To investigate and quantify the observed errors, the TELIS autocorrelator spectrometer was referenced against a well known FFT spectrometer [3] in simultaneous measurements. In order to generate well controlled input signals, a 50 Ohm load plunged into temperature stable slush-baths ranging from 77 K to 273 K has been used. The obtained input signal was split, processed and simultaneously fed into both spectrometer inputs for spectral intercomparison. We will show and discuss the obtained experimental results for radiometric characterisation of the TELIS autocorrelator spectrometer.

5000|$|The causes from a Ute {{perspective}} {{were given}} {{in the words of}} Chief Walkara in an interview with <b>interpreter</b> M. <b>S.</b> Martinas 1853. [...] "He (Walkara) said that he had always been opposed to the whites settling on the Indian lands, particularly that portion which he claims; and on which his band resides and on which they have resided since his childhood, and his parents before him—that the Mormons when they first commenced the settlement of Salt Lake Valley, was friendly, and promised them many comforts, and lasting friendship—that they continued friendly for a short time, until they became strong in numbers, then their conduct and treatment towards the Indians changed—they were not only treated unkindly, but many were much abused and this course has been pursued up to the present—sometimes they have been treated with much severity—they have been driven by this population from place to place—settlements have been made on all their hunting grounds in the valleys, and the graves of their fathers have been torn up by the whites." [...] This contrasts with Chief Walkara's meeting with Brigham Young in 1849 when Walkara offered his summer hunting ground in Sanpete for white settlement. One likely reason for this invitation was for Walkara to obtain cattle to feed his people.|$|R
