25|$|Maxwell's {{equations}} are partial {{differential equations}} that relate the electric and magnetic fields {{to each other}} and to the electric charges and currents. Often, the charges and currents are themselves dependent on the electric and magnetic fields via the Lorentz force equation and the constitutive relations. These all form a set of coupled partial differential equations, which are often very difficult to solve. In fact, the solutions of these equations encompass all the diverse phenomena in the entire field of classical electromagnetism. A thorough discussion is far beyond the scope of the article, but some <b>general</b> <b>notes</b> follow.|$|E

2500|$|The general {{plans for}} the series was {{outlined}} in a document titled Blake's Seven – Series Two – <b>General</b> <b>Notes.</b> This document noted that [...] "...the Federation must {{be shown to be}} even more powerful, even more ruthless and even more intelligent". To show this, the producers decided that one of the main characters would die. Nation, unhappy with Michael Keating's interpretation of the role, was keen for Vila to be killed. Nation's view was opposed by Boucher and Maloney because the character was popular with viewers. A commissioned Audience Research Report on the first series had indicated that Avon was the most popular character followed by Blake, Jenna, Vila, Cally and Gan. It is likely that this report influenced the decision to kill Gan.|$|E

2500|$|To {{assist the}} new writers, Boucher wrote a <b>General</b> <b>Notes</b> and Baffle Gab Glossary that {{explained}} {{the format of}} the series, the characters' backgrounds and outlined the various technical terms – such as [...] "spacials" [...] and [...] "teleport" [...] - that the series employed. Boucher wanted to write for the series and in May 1978 received clearance to write up to three scripts. Robert Holmes, Allan Prior, Roger Parkes and Pip and Jane Baker were commissioned to write the remainder of the episodes. It was intended that Boucher would write episode two, which would re-introduce Travis and Servalan; Holmes would write episode three, which would be an Orac story and Boucher would then provide the fourth episode, which would introduce the Storm Mountain storyline. Pip and Jane Baker's script, Death Squad, would follow, then Nation's Storm Mountain story. Boucher's next script would cover Travis' court-martial and Prior would write a script centred on a Ugandan-style society. This plan was later revised; Boucher would write episodes two and three, taking the story centred on Orac, while Holmes would write the fourth episode, which would introduce Storm Mountain.|$|E
