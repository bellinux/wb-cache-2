5|$|In January 350, the Roman empire was jointly {{ruled by}} two sons of Constantine I the <b>Great,</b> <b>the</b> Augusti (joint emperors) Constans, who ruled the West, and Constantius II in the East (the third brother, Constantine II, had been deposed and murdered by Constans' agents in 340).|$|E
5|$|In Saint Petersburg, Poniatowski met the 26-year-old Catherine Alexeievna (the future empress Catherine the <b>Great).</b> <b>The</b> two became lovers. Whatever his {{feelings}} for Catherine, {{it is likely}} Poniatowski also saw an opportunity to use the relationship for his own benefit, using her influence to bolster his career.|$|E
5|$|A further {{elaboration}} on {{this story}} is possibly found in a chronicle of Wincenty Kadłubek written some three centuries later. The chronicler, inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras, talks of a past Polish war with the army of Alexander the <b>Great.</b> <b>The</b> countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland, and the king himself, having previously subjugated the Pannonians, entered through Moravia {{as if it were}} a back door. He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Kraków area lands and Silesia, in the process leveling Kraków's ancient city walls. The evidence of a dozen or more gords attacked and destroyed in southern Lesser Poland at the end of 9th century lends some archeological credence to this fanciful version of events.|$|E

5|$|About 40 {{years after}} the Persian conquest of Ionia, and in {{the reign of the}} fourth Persian king, Darius the <b>Great,</b> <b>the</b> {{stand-in}} Milesian tyrant Aristagoras found himself in this familiar predicament. In 500 BC, Aristagoras was approached by some exiles from Naxos, who asked him {{to take control of the}} island. Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in Miletus by conquering Naxos, Aristagoras approached the satrap of Lydia, Artaphernes, proposing a joint attack on Naxos, to which Artaphernes assented.|$|E
5|$|Anna Maria Luisa's {{single most}} {{enduring}} act was the Family Pact. It ensured {{that all the}} Medicean art and treasures collected over nearly three centuries of political ascendancy remained in Florence. Cynthia Miller Lawrence, an American art-historian, argues that Anna Maria Luisa thus provisioned for Tuscany's future economy through tourism. Sixteen years after her death, the Uffizi Gallery, built by Cosimo the <b>Great,</b> <b>the</b> founder of the Grand Duchy, was made open to public viewing.|$|E
5|$|How <b>great</b> <b>the</b> {{glory of}} Origen was, appears {{from the fact}} that Firmilianus, bishop of Cæsarea, with all the Cappadocian bishops, sought a visit from him, and entertained him for a long while. Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the holy places, he came to Cæsarea and was {{instructed}} at length by Origen in the Holy Scriptures. It appears also {{from the fact that}} he went to Antioch, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander, and a woman religiously disposed, and was there held in great honour, and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become a Christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant.|$|E

5|$|In 1320, {{the kingdom}} was {{restored}} under Władysław I the Elbow-high, then strengthened and expanded {{by his son}} Casimir III the <b>Great.</b> <b>The</b> western provinces of Silesia and Pomerania were lost after the fragmentation, and Poland began expanding to the east. The period ended with the reigns of {{two members of the}} Capetian House of Anjou between 1370 and 1384. The consolidation in the 14th century laid the base for the new powerful kingdom of Poland that was to follow.|$|E
5|$|In 1542, {{the thirty}} year old {{must have been}} feeling {{confident}} about his future prospects when he suffered two major interruptions to his life. First, Leuven was besieged by the troops of the Duke of Cleves, a Lutheran sympathiser who, with French support, was set on exploiting unrest in the Low Countries to his own ends. Ironically it was this same Duke to whom Mercator would turn ten years hence. The siege was lifted but the financial losses to the town and its traders, including Mercator, were <b>great.</b> <b>The</b> second interruption was potentially deadly: the Inquisition called.|$|E
5|$|In 191 BC, Antiochus the <b>Great,</b> <b>the</b> Emperor of the Seleucid Empire of Asia, invaded Greece.

The Romans followed them across the Aegean Sea and together with their allies, Pergamum, they decisively defeated the Seleucids at the Battle of Magnesia.|$|E

5|$|Smithfield {{comprises}} {{the market as}} its central feature surrounded many old buildings on three sides and a public open space (or Rotunda Garden) at West Smithfield, beneath {{which there is a}} public car park. The south side is occupied by St Bartholomew's Hospital (known as Barts in common parlance), and on the east side by the Priory Church of St Bartholomew the <b>Great.</b> <b>The</b> Church of St Bartholomew the Less is located next to the King Henry VIII Gate, the hospital's main entrance. The north and south of the square are now closed to through traffic, as part of the City's security and surveillance cordon known as the Ring of steel. Security for the market is provided by its market constabulary.|$|E

5|$|The {{damage done}} to Ford was <b>great.</b> <b>The</b> local fire brigades helped put out the {{numerous}} fires and clear up the dead {{in and around the}} station. Mostly foam was used as the main water pipe had burst. Other fire units used water from static water tanks and a ditch which had filled from the fractured pipe. Ford had received less warning than the other targets and suffered heavier casualties: 28 killed and 75 wounded. Some 14 aircraft were destroyed: five Blackburn Sharks, five Fairey Swordfish, and two Fairey Albacore. A further 26 aircraft were damaged but repairable. As well as petrol and oil installations, two hangars, the motor transport hangar, two stores buildings, the ratings' and petty officers' canteens and numerous accommodation buildings were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{maritime}} fur trade in Southern China by itself was probably not <b>great.</b> <b>The</b> Canton trade as a whole had limited effect on China, mostly limited to the tea growers of Fujian, the silk producers of Nanjing, the craftsmen of Canton, and various middlemen, and merchants. The ruling Manchus kept foreign trade by ship at bay. It was restricted to Canton, and even there was allowed only outside the city walls. China was generally self-sufficient. The main {{effect of the}} Old China Trade was an increased import of opium and related outflow of specie, which resulted in China being incorporated into the capitalist world system after 1830. However, the maritime fur trade played a minor role in this process.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of East Anglia was {{absorbed into the}} kingdom of England.

5|$|With {{the death}} of Casimir the <b>Great,</b> <b>the</b> period of {{hereditary}} (Piast) monarchy in Poland came to an end.

Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> <b>the</b> {{area of a}} uniform host population with high horizontal resistances, the more effective the horizontal resistance becomes.

5|$|Although the Seven Years' War was {{a global}} conflict, {{it took on}} a {{specific}} intensity in the European theater based on the recently concluded War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle gave FrederickII of Prussia, known as Frederick the <b>Great,</b> <b>the</b> prosperous province of Silesia. Empress Maria Theresa of Austria had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances; she was intent upon regaining ascendancy in the Holy Roman Empire as well as reacquiring Silesia. In 1754, escalating tensions between Great Britain and France in North America offered France an opportunity to break the British dominance of Atlantic trade. Recognizing the opportunity to regain her lost territories and to limit Prussia's growing power, the Empress put aside the old rivalry with France {{to form a new}} coalition. Faced with this turn of events, Britain aligned herself with the Kingdom of Prussia; this alliance drew in not only the British king's territories held in personal union, including Hanover, but also those of his and Frederick's relatives in the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. This series of political maneuvers became known as the Diplomatic Revolution.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Alexander the <b>Great,</b> <b>the</b> only Macedonian cavalry units attested in battle were the {{companion}} cavalry. However, during his campaign in Asia against the Persian Empire he formed a hipparchia (i.e. unit {{of a few hundred}} horsemen) of companion cavalry composed entirely of ethnic Persians. When marching his forces into Asia, Alexander brought 1,800 cavalrymen from Macedonia, 1,800 cavalrymen from Thessaly, 600 cavalrymen from the rest of Greece, and 900 prodromoi cavalry from Thrace. Antipater was able to quickly levy 600 native Macedonian cavalry to fight in the Lamian War when it began in 323 BC. For his infantry, the most elite members of his hypaspistai were designated as the agema, yet a new term for hypaspistai emerged after the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC: the argyraspides ('silver shields'). The latter continued to serve after {{the reign of}} Alexander the Great and may have been of Asian origin. Overall, his pike-wielding infantry numbered some 12,000 men, 3,000 of which were elite hypaspistai and 9,000 of which were pezhetairoi. Alexander continued the use of Cretan archers, yet around this time a clear reference to the use of native Macedonian archers was made. After the Battle of Gaugamela, archers of West Asian backgrounds became commonplace and were organized into chiliarchs.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a revolt}} in 1028, Harald's brother Olaf {{was forced into}} exile until he {{returned}} to Norway in early 1030. On hearing news of Olaf's planned return, Harald gathered 600 men from the Uplands to meet Olaf and his men upon their arrival in the east of Norway. After a friendly welcome, Olaf went on to gather an army and eventually fight in the Battle of Stiklestad on 29 July 1030, in which Harald took part on his brother's side. The battle {{was part of an}} attempt to restore Olaf to the Norwegian throne, which had been captured by the Danish king Cnut the <b>Great.</b> <b>The</b> battle resulted in defeat for the brothers at the hands of those Norwegians who were loyal to Cnut, and Olaf was killed while Harald was badly wounded. Harald was nonetheless remarked to have shown considerable military talent during the battle.|$|E
