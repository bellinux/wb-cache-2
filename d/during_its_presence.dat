50|$|To recoup its sharply higher {{fuel costs}} in the Berlin market, the airline imposed a fuel {{surcharge}} on all tour operators that had contracted their flying programme from Berlin to it. The operators passed on this fuel surcharge to their IT passengers. A major disagreement over the fuel surcharge between Modern Air's management and its counterpart at Berliner Flugring, its main overseas business partner, led {{to a reduction in}} the Berlin-based fleet from five to four aircraft for the 1974 summer season. There was a plan to replace the fuel-guzzling CV-990s with more efficient, second-hand McDonnell Douglas DC-8s and DC-9s in time for the 1975 summer season. However, an attempt on Modern Air's part to pass on a further increase in its fuel surcharge to Berliner Flugring for the planned 1974/75 winter flying programme resulted in the tour operator's refusal to renew its long-standing charter contract with the airline.

In this essay, I discuss the differences in Spain’s educational policies between Northern Morocco and the Western Sahara with a special focus on the implications for the postcolonial language policies and the current linguistic landscape in both areas.

Only subtle differences could be evidenced in the adult brains following microarray and QPCR analyses.

40|$|Following {{identification}} of the human motilin receptor, we isolated the rabbit orthologue by PCR amplification and found this to be 85 % identical to the open reading frame of the human receptor. The protein encoded was 84 % identical to the human polypeptide. In HEK 293 T cells transfected with the rabbit receptor, motilin concentration-dependently increased intracellular calcium mobilisation (pEC 50 = 9. 25). After transfection with Go 1 α, motilin similarly stimulated [35 S]GTPγS binding (pEC 50 = 8. 87). Using both systems, similar values were obtained with the human receptor, with rank-order potencies of motilin=[Nle 13]-motilin>erythromycin; ghrelin was ineffective. In circular muscle preparations of rabbit gastric antrum, [Nle 13]-motilin 0. 1 – 30 nM concentration-dependently increased the amplitude of electrically-evoked, neuronally-mediated contractions (pEC 50 = 8. 3); higher concentrations increased the muscle tension (30 – 3000 nM). Both responses to [Nle 13]-motilin faded rapidly <b>during</b> <b>its</b> continual <b>presence.</b> Rat or human ghrelin 0. 01 – 10 μM were without activity.

It has been found that at oil pollution (OP) concentrations in water at concentrations of tens of micrograms per litre the intensity of their fluorescence band is significantly lower than that of aquatic humic substances (AHS), typical of coastal waters. Generally, the OP and AHS fluorescence bands overlap (to a greater or lesser degree at different excitation wavelengths).

40|$|Abstract: Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) leads to {{profound}} haemodynamic changes. Constant outflows {{from the central}} autonomic pattern generators modulate {{the activity of the}} spinal sympathetic neurons. Sudden loss of communication between these centers and the sympathetic neurons in the intermediolateral thoracic and lumbar spinal cord leads to spinal shock. After high SCI, experimental data demonstrated a brief hypertensive peak followed by bradycardia with escape arrhythmias and marked hypotension. Total peripheral resistance and cardiac output decrease, while central venous pressure remains unchanged. The initial hypertensive peak is thought to result from direct sympathetic stimulation <b>during</b> SCI and <b>its</b> <b>presence</b> is anaesthetic agent dependent. Hypotension improves within days in most animal species because of reasons not totally understood, which may include synaptic reorganization or hyper responsiveness of receptors. No convincing data has demonstrated that the deafferented spinal cord can generate significant basal sympathetic activity. However, with the spinal shock resolution, the deafferented spinal cord (in lesions above T 6) will generate life-threatening hypertensive bouts with compensatory bradycardia, known as autonomic hyperreflexia (AH) after stimuli such as pain or bladder/colonic distension. AH results from the lack of supraspinal control of the sympathetic neurons and altered neurotransmission (e. g. glutamatergic) within the spinal cord. Despite significant progress in recent years, further research is necessary to fully understand the spectrum of haemodynamic changes after SCI...|$|R

The species composition of euphausiid aggregations was examined relative to abrupt changes in topography and variations in environmental conditions along the Northwest Atlantic shelf break. Net sampling was conducted on seven occasions from 2004 - 2013 within three canyons and two non-canyon sites along the New England shelf break.

30|$|Stent design {{parameters}} can be listed as follows: {{the dimension of}} the stent struts, the full expansion of the stent, the radial strength of the stent, {{the extent of the}} balloon injury during the stent deployment, the nature of the disease itself (the intensity of the obstruction of the artery), ability to tolerate the compression exerted by the vessel wall, minimum longitudinal contraction by the time of expanding, and the amount of flexibility of the stent, especially for curved vessels to suitably flex in them (Driver 2012; Prendergast et al. 2003; Alexander et al. 2017). The stent material requires to be non-erodible, non-cytotoxic, resorbable, flexible, radio-opaque, biocompatible, compatible with the chemical nature of the drug, and ideally to have sufficient radial strength. Titanium (Ti) and its alloys have been reported as a potential material for the stent backbone with excellent biocompatibility and corrosion resistance {{as a result of a}} stable oxide layer on the surface. A new Ti-base alloy was proposed by Saleh et al. as the stent platform with decorated nanostructures on the surface. With comparable mechanical properties to nitinol, Ti-base alloy was investigated as a promising substrate to further replace commonly used stent backbones. So far, there are limited reports on the application of Ti and its alloys for the stent material. However, their coatings showed excellent reduced rate of thrombogenicity and intimal hyperplasia such as Titan stent (Saleh et al. 2017). Another design parameter is the surface coating which must be appropriate for the best adhesion of drugs, be compatible with drug molecules, and be biocompatible (Driver 2012). Generally, materials to be implanted or injected in the body are needed to be both chemically and mechanically stable in the biological environment for long-term use. As a result, when deciding for a potential biomaterial dual approach must be taken: first, studying the biodegradation of the material in the host tissue environment as well as the safety of biodegradation products to impede sensitivity in the local site of prosthesis and second, studying the behavior of the biomaterial <b>during</b> <b>its</b> <b>presence</b> in the body (Guildford et al. 2010). Biodegradable stents are promising candidates for the future vast clinical application. To date, there are two classes of materials for the production of biodegradable stents: metals and polymers. Degradation of the stent, though, is still the most concerning issue due to vessel recoil problems and hypersensitivity (Guildford et al. 2010). The preference of surgeons for using metal-based stents instead of polymeric ones arises from the fact that a metallic platform has not only greater amount of mechanical strength, but also the control over thrombosis rate can be achieved by the association of medications like heparin (Hep) within the stent (Kohn and Zeltinger 2005). In terms of polymer selection, it is important for the coating to maintain the mechanical integrity during DES implantation. Not only the mechanical properties of the coating material, but also comprehensive information on the stent component and their interactions with the host tissue they are implanted in are two other indispensable factors for the safety and efficacy of each stent. Combining the good mechanical properties of the iron metal with biodegradability of polymer employed in metal-polymer composite strategy indicated improved properties of metal-based stents (MBS) in biodegradation rates. The coating of biodegradable aliphatic polyester (PLA) on the ironic metal backbone accelerated the iron corrosion. A complete strength loss of polymer-coated metal-based stents was achieved no more than 6  months in vivo. This degradation rate was much faster than MBS which was attributed to the acidic degradation products of PLA hydrolysis. Animal experiments showed successful tissue regeneration by implanting stents into the animal model (Qi et al. 2017). Extensive in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials are necessary to assure the safety of their implantation for the use in body (Schmidt et al. 2009). First trials for proving the constructed bioconstruction are conducted in vitro by culturing autologous cells onto the so-called scaffold (Generali et al. 2014). By in vitro testing of DES, pharmacological action of drugs can be well predicted (Grabow et al. 2010). Controlling the cell culture under the simulated body condition in a bioreactor is the in vivo test (Generali et al. 2014). In vivo testing of the stent is needed to examine the behavior of a stent in the simulated body condition, but it is not all enough since the results might not be well extensible (translated) for the real application (Grabow et al. 2010). The autologous cells are preferred for this approach to eliminate any probable immunogenic reaction of the body (Generali et al. 2014). So, more long-term follow-up clinical trials are necessary to ensure safety and efficacy of stents.|$|E

This research aims at analyzing {{what extent}} {{and under what}} circumstances the presence of third part influences or interferes with the educational virtual chats through changes in participantsâ footing in these chats and linguistic politeness that they invest in turning points. Our work in this dissertation seeks to achieve this relationship which, in our view, seems inseparable for understanding social relations. Therefore, as the basis of our studies we take Goffman (1967, 1981), Brown; Levinson (1987, 1978), Leech (1983, 2005), and more recently, investigations by Paiva; Rodrigues-Junior (2008), Paiva (2004) and Pereira (2009). To achieve the researchâs aims, we had the collaboration of students and teachers from Sociolinguistics, Linguistics and Textual Reading and Production of Academic Texts disciplines, offered in the Portuguese Literature course at the Federal University of CearÃ. The participants answered a questionnaire that aimed to understand their habits and affinities with educational virtual chat tools. After crossing and tabling the information provided in the questionnaires and analyzing fifteen chats, we found that the figure of the content teacher does not only act as a third part or zone of influence, but also he/she interferes in some instances to the changing in participants of the interactionâs footing. The most significant type of footing change is in the format of production, in which tutors and students demonstrate that {{in the presence of the}} third part, they seek to be more impeller than sponsors or authors. Also, in the presence of the third part, students avoid inserting frames of long duration. Regarding the change of footing for participation structure, the presence of the third part seems to have conditioned the momentary exclusion of the tutor interaction <b>during</b> <b>its</b> <b>presence,</b> which in turn, excluded students, even in this moment of interaction. These results demonstrate that the internal motion to social interactions (footing) held in virtual educational chats is very sensitive to the presence of higher-ranking member, and it can even extend during its absence. With this investigation, we can conclude that the choice of certain politeness strategies, such as use group and identity markers, include listener and speaker in the same activity, nominalize, hold off yourself from the author and add formality, hold off yourself from pronouns such as I and you assist in establishing and changing footings by the participants because they demonstrate the level of engagement undertaken, signaling to which moments the observer interferes with the projection of their faces...|$|E

The lagoons of the area have now their specific character and dynamics which are obvious in the morphology, hydrology and water quality and also they are detected through the analysis of the salinity fluctuations and the water level tidal dynamics. The landings composition is lagoon specific with different dominant species in each lagoon. The last 10 years the sea bream landings show an increasing trend in contrast with the generalised decreasing landings of the rest of the species. The young sea bream specimens of 0 + group are mainly present in the lagoons. Only 10 % of the fishes are older than 2 years. The sex ratio is naturally dominated by males, as the species is protandric. The study of the scales revealed very interesting elements concerning the origin of the specimens which can be supplied by enhancement trials or accidental escapement from the fish farms. Moreover, the fact that the R 1 ray of the 0 -group fishes caught in the lagoons was larger than the R 1 ray of older specimens suggest that the majority of the last group was distributed outside the lagoons where the environment was less favorable for their growth. Finally, the form of the scales can be used as criterion for the origin of the specimens. Scales comprising two parts, an internal one without rings and an external with well developed strings characterize fishes originated from aquaculture activities. A great diversity of the fish growth was observed both between lagoons and between years for the same lagoon. Heterogeneity characterize also the size and species composition of different fishing gears used in the lagoons. This diversity is not due only to the gear selectivity but is enhanced by the migratory behaviour of the fishes. This remark is important because this aspect contributes to the species composistion revealed by the fishery landings and also affects the growth estimates provided by mixed fishery data. The influence of the fish eating birds of the species Phalacrocorax carbo on the fishes remaining during the winter in the lagoons following the “modern” exploitation patterns, keeping the fishes in the lagoon during the winter, revealed very important independantly on the fish size. The influence of the aquaculture on the wild populations in the lagoons is the result of enhancement trials but also accidental escapements from the farms. The growth and survival of the introduced specimens depends on the size of the fish, the season and the state of the environment. Tagging experiments revealed interesting elements about the negative influence of the tag on the fish growth and also the performance of the enhancement as a function of fish size and season. More than 25 % of the Greek sea farms and 20 % of the hatcheries of sea bream and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) of the country are located close to the lagoon area. Sea bream represents 60 % of the total production. The last decade a spectacular increase of the number and size of farms and also of the farming processes were observed. These changes led to the maintenance of specimens more than 500 g in cages. These fishes are large and old enough to observe sex changes leading to an important presence of females in the cages. These fishes are potential spawners. The study, based on the study of the sex ratio and the sexual maturity stage of the fishes in the cages confirms this fact. In addition, the last 5 years a spectacular increase of about 80 % of the sea bream landings in the lagoons was recorded. This increase was accompanied by a decrease in the mean size and consequently the market price of the 0 + group individuals producing substantial decrease in the earnings of the lagoon fisheries. The linkage between these opposite trends and the role of the aquaculture is discussed. ...|$|E
