These associations allow McFague to explore how creation of the cosmos as something ‘bodied forth’ from God preserves a much more intimate connection between creator and created than the traditional model whereby the world is created ex nihilo and sustained by a God distanced and separate from the creation. However, this same ‘mother’ who ‘bodies forth’ the cosmos cares for it with a fierce justice, which demands that all life (not just humankind) has its share of the creator’s care and sustenance in a just, <b>ecological</b> <b>economy</b> where all her creatures flourish. For McFague, God is the one ‘who judges those who thwart the well-being and fulfilment of her body, our world’.|$|E

30|$|The {{interest}} in using fractional differential equations in modeling <b>ecological</b> <b>economy</b> and diffusive processes has wide literature.

Recently this interest has also been activated by recent progress in the mathematical theory and psycho-socio-economical dynamics, see [1, 2].

40|$|The {{interrelation}} {{of humanity}} and its biosphere is undoubtedly a basic problem of the present day. A new science- ecology gained in this context a considerable importance. A postulate of ecologizing is advocated i. e. of linking ecology with all activities of mankind. In the effect the ecology of man appeared, programs of protection of natural environment, new paradigm of economic sciences and ecological ethics were formulated. The traditional economic paradigm based of autonomy of society and economy toward nature {{becomes more and more}} of no avail in analysis of the modern economic processes. The concept of "homo oeconomicus" and traditional methods of economic calculations are not adequate from the view-point of- ecology and the long run functioning of economy. <b>Ecological</b> <b>economy</b> recognizes a close dependence of man and economy from their biosphere. It is also refuting traditional economic indices of welfare focusing its attention of a quality of life. Ecological ethics is related to <b>ecological</b> <b>economy,</b> it is studying moral relations man to man and man to environment. A program of natural protection has a complementary character toward economy and ecological ethics. An urgent necessity of intensifying ecologization of economy and of bringing basic propositions of <b>ecological</b> <b>economy</b> into life is presently observed.

It has been published systematically by the media that Florianópolis {{is a place that}} propitiates a high life quality to their inhabitants associated with a preserved environment. This kind of idea has encouraged groups of interests that seek for short-term profits by doing businesses in the island. And, it also contributes to the formation of acommon sense stereotype in values and practices that deserve to be unmasked scientifically. Ananalys is through the perspective of <b>ecological</b> <b>economy</b> is capable of that. <b>Ecological</b> <b>economy</b> is the branch of the economics science that analyzes the social relationships starting from the consideration of the physical flows of energy and materials.

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainability}} in its contemporary form {{stems from the}} Brundtland Report, {{which was published in}} (1987) by the United Nation’s (UN) World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED). This report proposes long-term strategies for achieving sustainable development by addressing three key elements: <b>ecological</b> environment, <b>economy,</b> and social equity (Edwards 2005). The environmental dimension of sustainability requires the long-term viability of resource use and emphasizes the issue of environmental degradation and resource depletion (Sheth et al. 2011). Economic sustainability refers to a dynamic economy that endures {{for a long period of}} time, while also recognizing the importance of providing secure, long-term employment (Edwards 2005). The social dimension of sustainability refers to the well-being of people and the community and equity/equality issues (Edwards 2005). Elkington (1998) incorporates these three facets of sustainability into actual business performance and argues that businesses should look not only at the traditional measures of economic performance (i.e., profits) but also consider the measures of social and environmental performances, reflecting “triple bottom line” (TBL) of sustainability.|$|R
