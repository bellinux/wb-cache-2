40|$|Tools {{created by}} the {{computer}} hacking community to circumvent security protection on hard drives can have unintentional consequences for digital forensics. Tools originally developed to circumvent Microsoft 2 ̆ 7 s Xbox 360 hard <b>drive</b> <b>protection</b> can be used, independently of the Xbox 360 system, to change the reported size/model of a hard drive enabling criminals to hide data from digital forensic software and hardware. The availability of such concealment methods raises the risk of evidence being overlooked, particularly as triage and on-scene inspections of digital media become more common.

40|$|Whilst {{the concept}} of {{humanity}} is most {{often referred to as}} the moral source of the Responsibility to Protect’s (R 2 P) motivational capacity, humanity’s normative status and value has continued to be left assumed and/or unexplored. Consequently, there remains a considerable lack of analysis into humanity’s role in supposedly helping to both locate moral harm and subsequently providing a motivational cause that can <b>drive</b> <b>protection</b> practices in support of the R 2 P principle. In response to this lacuna, this article puts forward three hypotheses regarding the motivational role of humanity in this process; a) humanity functioning as a rhetorical tool with no motivational qualities; b) humanity as a concept that works to redefine sovereignty in support of the R 2 P; c) humanity as a motivating principle that ultimately diminishes in influence as the R 2 P principle is diffused into action. Through this analysis, the article offers a more rigorous and systematic evaluation of humanity's limitations as a moral motivator for generating collective response to mass atrocity crimes, highlighting the need to further develop understanding of the complex interaction between morality and politics in international decision making...|$|E

40|$|When {{creating}} {{software for}} a new power systems control or protection device, the use of auto-generated C code via MATLAB Simulink Real-Time Workshop and Embedded Coder toolboxes can be a sensible alternative to hand written C code. This approach offers {{the benefits of a}} simulation environment, platform independence and robust code. This paper briefly summarises recent experiences with this coding process including {{the pros and cons of}} such an approach. Extensive benchmarking activities are presented, together with descriptions of simple (but non-obvious) optimisations made as a result of the benchmarking. Examples include replacement of certain Simulink blocks with seemingly more complex blocks which execute faster. "S functions" are also designed for certain key algorithms. These must be fully "in-lined" to obtain the best speed performance. Together, these optimisations can lead to an increase in execution speed of more than 1. 4 x in a large piece of auto-generated C code. An example is presented, which carries out Fourier analysis of 3 signals at a common (variable) frequency. The overall speed improvement relative to the baseline is 2. 3 x, of which more than 1. 4 x is due to non-obvious improvements resulting from benchmarking activities. Such execution speed improvements allow higher frame rates or larger algorithms within inverters, <b>drives,</b> <b>protection</b> and control applications...|$|R

Automatic motion planning and navigation is the primary task of an automated guided vehicle or mobile robots.
