5|$|A {{large portion}} of the Persian army was trapped in its camp and slaughtered. The {{destruction}} of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy allegedly on the same day at the Battle of Mycale, decisively ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars.

5|$|Although the Persian forces put up stout resistance, {{the heavily}} {{armoured}} Greek hoplites again proved themselves superior in combat, and eventually routed the Persian troops, who fled to their camp. The Ionian Greek contingents in the Persian army defected, and {{the camp was}} assailed {{and a large number}} of Persians slaughtered. The Persian ships were then captured and burned. The complete destruction of the Persian navy, along with the destruction of Mardonius's army at Plataea (allegedly on the same day as the Battle of Mycale), decisively ended the invasion of Greece. After Plataea and Mycale, the allied Greeks would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars.

30|$|Three soft SSDF attack {{models have}} been widely adopted to test various secure sensing algorithms: Always Yes[13], Always No[14, 15], and Always Adverse[16]. In Always Yes soft SSDF attack, an {{attacker}} raises its local observations by injecting a positive offset <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>sensing</b> slot. <b>In</b> Always No attack, an attacker decreases its local observations by injecting a negative offset <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>sensing</b> slot. <b>In</b> Always Adverse attack, an attacker firstly performs a local binary hypothesis testing between H 0 and H 1 by comparing its energy observation with a predefined threshold, with H 0 denoting {{the case that the}} primary signal is absent and H 1 otherwise; then, the malicious SU raises its observations when its local binary decision is H 0 and decreases its observations when its decision is H 1. One main limitation of the existing soft SSDF attack models is that they are oversimplified and not general enough to serve as the baseline for the design of counter-attack or secure sensing algorithms.|$|R

30|$|In this section, {{we first}} review the {{definition}} of traditional detection probability and present its limitations. Then, the concept and definition of our TDP is presented. Without loss of generality, a periodic sensing scheme is considered (i.e., <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>sensing</b> interval, a secondary user senses the channel of interest during the sensing duration). We assume that the sensing duration is relatively short compared to the sensing interval and the mean busy and idle periods of primary users are relatively long compared to the sensing interval. Based on these assumptions, {{the probability that a}} primary signal changes its state during the sensing duration is very small, and thus considered as being negligible in this article.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{cognitive}} radio networks, cooperative spectrum sensing {{is used to}} exploit spatial diversity of secondary users, in order to reliably detect an unoccupied licensed spectrum. Since each secondary user experience different channel conditions, therefore observations of secondary users are weighted according to the reliability factor (weight) of individual secondary user. However, the weight estimation is done in each sensing interval resulting in high cooperation overhead in terms of time, processing and reporting channel bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative spectrum sensing scheme {{which is based on}} the Log-Likelihood ratio (LLR). The secondary users employ two threshold level to minimize false-alarms and miss-detection of the primary user's signal. In addition, unknown parameters for weight computation are estimated/updated after certain number of sensing intervals instead of estimating them <b>in</b> <b>every</b> <b>sensing</b> interval. <b>In</b> this way, the detection performance is increased while the cooperation overhead reduces. To evaluate the detection performance of the proposed scheme we do a simulation study and compare it with the popular optimal detection schemes...|$|R
