5|$|Mallard {{have had}} a long {{relationship}} with humans. Almost all <b>domestic</b> duck breeds derive from the mallard, {{with the exception of}} a few Muscovy breeds. Mallards are generally monogamous while <b>domestic</b> ducks are mostly polygamous. <b>Domestic</b> ducks have no territorial behaviour and are less aggressive than mallards. <b>Domestic</b> ducks are mostly kept for meat, as their eggs have a strong flavor. They were first domesticated in Southeast Asia at least 4000 years ago, during the Neolithic Age, and were also farmed by the Romans in Europe, and the Malays in Asia. It is also common for mallards to mate with <b>domestic</b> ducks and produce hybrid offspring that are fully fertile. Due to this, mallards have been found to be contaminated with the genes of the <b>domestic</b> duck.|$|E

5|$|The <b>domestic</b> cat {{was first}} {{classified}} as Felis catus by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae published in 1758. Because of modern phylogenetics, <b>domestic</b> cats are usually regarded as another subspecies of the wildcat, F. silvestris. This has resulted in mixed usage of the terms, as the <b>domestic</b> cat can be called by its subspecies name, Felis silvestris catus. Wildcats have also {{been referred to as}} various subspecies of F. catus, but in 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature fixed the name for wildcats as F. silvestris. The most common name in use for the <b>domestic</b> cat remains F. catus. Sometimes, the <b>domestic</b> cat has been called Felis domesticus as proposed by German naturalist J.C.P. Erxleben in 1777, but these are not valid taxonomic names and have been used only rarely in scientific literature. A population of Transcaucasian black feral cats was once classified as Felis daemon (Satunin 1904) but now this population {{is considered to be a}} part of <b>domestic</b> cat.|$|E
40|$|The Lebanese use a {{combination}} of Arabic and English telegraphic speech, along with gestures and other forms of speech adjustments to address their <b>domestics.</b> This pattern of inadequate speech is based on the misconception that <b>domestics</b> understand exactly the same way they speak. Using interviews, questionnaires, and participant observations, the researchers identified some of the underlying issues, power and trust, related to this form of fragmented speech. The investigators recommended that communication with <b>domestics</b> be in one language and in complete sentences, not only for the sake of language acquisition but to ensure a fair treatment of foreign helpers.

Working <b>domestic</b> animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery. In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas.

5|$|<b>Domestic</b> sheep are {{relatively}} small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral. <b>Domestic</b> sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic {{as a result of}} selective breeding by humans. A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, <b>domestic</b> sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.|$|E
