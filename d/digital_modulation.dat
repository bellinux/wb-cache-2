40|$|Abstract- <b>Digital</b> vector <b>modulation</b> {{has become}} the {{preferred}} method of modulation used in modern digital transmission systems. This type of modulation, however, exhibits inherently high peak-to-average power ratios and requires a large linear dynamic range for proper operation. The peak power level changes continuously and randomly and occupies a large bandwidth. Conventional methods of measuring peak power prove to be unusable. This application note analyzes {{the sources of the}} peak power in digitally vector modulated systems and addresses the capabilities that are needed for proper measurement. The Boonton 4400 is presented as an advanced PeakPower Analyzer well suited for measurements of this type. <b>Digital</b> Vector <b>Modulation</b> <b>Digital</b> vector <b>modulation</b> is being utilized {{in a wide variety of}} technologies such as digital cellular radio, high definition television (HDTV), satellite and microwave links, military communication, and numerous spread spectrum applications. <b>Digital</b> vector <b>modulation</b> is a complex modulation scheme whereby a signal’s phase and/or amplitude are altered to represent digital bit patterns called symbols.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to encryption, the widespread availability, in the US, of DBS {{services such as}} PrimeStar and DirecTV had been reducing the popularity of TVRO systems since the early 1990s. [...] Signals from DBS satellites (operating in the more recent Ku band) are higher in both frequency and power (due to improvements in the solar panels and energy efficiency of modern satellites) and therefore require much smaller dishes than C-band, and the <b>digital</b> <b>modulation</b> methods now used require less signal strength at the receiver than analog modulation methods. Each satellite also can carry up to 32 transponders in the Ku band, but only 24 in the C band, and several digital subchannels can be multiplexed (MCPC) or carried separately (SCPC) on a single transponder. Advances in noise reduction due to improved microwave technology and semiconductor materials have also had an effect. However, one consequence of the higher frequencies used for DBS services is rain fade where viewers lose signal during a heavy downpour. C-band satellite television signals are less prone to rain fade.|$|E

40|$|In an {{underwater}} environment {{it is difficult}} to implement solutions for wireless communications. The existing technologies using electromagnetic waves or lasers are not very efficient due to the large attenuation in the aquatic environment. Ultrasound reveals a lower attenuation, and thus has been used in underwater long-distance communications. The much slower speed of acoustic propagation in water (about 1500 m/s) compared with that of electromagnetic and optical waves, is another limiting factor for efficient communication and networking. For high data-rates and real-time applications it is necessary to use frequencies in the MHz range, allowing communication distances of hundreds of meters with a delay of milliseconds. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to develop ultrasound transducers able to work at high frequencies and wideband, with suitable responses to <b>digital</b> <b>modulations.</b> This work shows how the acoustic impedance influences the performance of an ultrasonic emitter transducer when <b>digital</b> <b>modulations</b> are used and operating at frequencies between 100 kHz and 1 MHz. The study includes a Finite Element Method (FEM) and a MATLAB/Simulink simulation with an experimental validation to evaluate two types of piezoelectric materials: one based on ceramics (high acoustic impedance) with a resonance design and the other based in polymer (low acoustic impedance) designed to optimize the performance when <b>digital</b> <b>modulations</b> are used. The transducers performance for Binary Amplitude Shift Keying (BASK), On-Off Keying (OOK), Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) and Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK) modulations with a 1 MHz carrier at 125 kbps baud rate are compared.
