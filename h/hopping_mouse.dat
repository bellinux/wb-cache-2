40|$|The {{phenotype}} of {{the spontaneous}} mutant <b>mouse</b> hop-sterile (<b>hop)</b> {{is characterized by}} a hopping gait, polydactyly, hydrocephalus, and male sterility. Previous analyses of the <b>hop</b> <b>mouse</b> revealed a deficiency of inner dynein arms in motile cilia and a lack of sperm flagella, potentially accounting for the hydrocephalus and male sterility. The etiology of the other phenotypes and the location of the hop mutation remained unexplored. Here we show that the hop mutation is located in the Ttc 26 gene and impairs Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Expression analysis showed that this mutation led to dramatically reduced levels of the Ttc 26 protein, and protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated that wild-type Ttc 26 binds directly to the Ift 46 subunit of Intraflagellar Transport (IFT) complex B. Although IFT is required for ciliogenesis, the Ttc 26 defect did not result in a decrease in the number or length of primary cilia. Nevertheless, Hh signaling was reduced in the <b>hop</b> <b>mouse,</b> as revealed by impaired activation of Gli transcription factors in embryonic fibroblasts and abnormal patterning of the neural tube. Unlike the previously characterized mutations that affect IFT complex B, hop did not interfere with Hh-induced accumulation of Gli {{at the tip of the}} primary cilium, but rather with the subsequent dissociation of Gli from its negative regulator, Sufu.

40|$|Exposure {{to extreme}} {{temperature}} {{conditions such as}} occurs in certain occupations is known to induce male infertility. In humans {{and most of the}} eutherian mammals, {{it has been shown that}} whole body heat stress decreases fertility and produces defective embryos. However, the mechanisms producing fertility defects post exposure to whole body heat are not yet fully determined. Hence, the present study aimed at gaining some insight into the mechanisms producing fertility defects after whole body heat stress. Laboratory mice were exposed to constant temperatures higher than their core body temperature of 37 - 38 °C for 8 h on three consecutive days. A decrease in testis weight occurred as early as 7 days post exposure to heat with weights comparable to controls by 21 days post heat exposure. Histology of the testicular tissue showed germ cell apoptosis affecting the pachytene spermatocytes and the spermatids. Germ cell apoptosis was investigated by TUNEL 16 h, 7, 14 and 21 days following the heat treatment. Apoptosis was found to be stage-specific affecting early and late stages of the seminiferous epithelium cycle on day 7 and 14 post exposure to heat stress with involvement of all stages of seminiferous epithelium 16 h following heat stress. Reduction in germ cell apoptosis was evident 21 days post exposure. To determine the mechanism of germ cell apoptosis, caspase- 3 proteins were detected in apoptotic germ cells following heat stress which showed strong positivity. Hence, we concluded that whole body heat stress results in caspase- 3 mediated germ cell apoptosis. Furthermore, changes in cauda epididymal spermatozoa were investigated to determine sperm apoptosis following heat stress. Sperm apoptosis was detected by the exteriorization of phosphotidylserine (PS) on the outer layer of the plasma membrane. The results showed an early and late apoptosis in caudal epididymal spermatozoa 16 hr following heat treatment. A second experiment was conducted to determine the time of appearance of changes in spermatozoa following whole body heat stress for which the duration of exposure to heat of 37 - 38 °C was reduced to one-day period. This showed more spermatozoa in the early phase of apoptosis with fewer dead spermatozoa, which is suggestive of a time and temperature dependant pattern of sperm apoptosis. Arid-adapted Notomys alexis (<b>hopping</b> <b>mice)</b> were also investigated to determine whether differences in response to whole body heat have evolved in extreme climate conditions. Therefore <b>hopping</b> <b>mice</b> were exposed to similar temperatures as laboratory mice to investigate heat influences on germ cells and spermatozoa. Like the laboratory mice, germ cells and spermatozoa of <b>hopping</b> <b>mice</b> also showed apoptosis. However, unlike in laboratory mice, stage specificity in apoptosis could not be determined in <b>hopping</b> <b>mice</b> because of the presence of more than one cell association within the cross sections of the seminiferous tubules. Similar to laboratory mice, germ cell apoptosis in <b>hopping</b> <b>mice</b> was caspase- 3 mediated. The vasculature of <b>hopping</b> <b>mice</b> was also determined to look for any variations in the cooling mechanisms, which could have resulted in germ cell apoptosis. We found the absence of a coiled testicular artery suggestive of a lack of such a cooling mechanism in <b>hopping</b> <b>mice</b> that could have resulted in germ cell and sperm apoptosis. We also investigated changes in germ cells following experimental cryptorchidism, which showed tubular degeneration with low numbers of germ cells lining the seminiferous epithelium. Thus the findings indicated that whole body heat had a detrimental effect on developing germ cells and spermatozoa. It is also known that heat stress changes other bodily functions to maintain body homeostasis. Heat stress is associated with an activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, which is followed by an increase in blood cortisol levels in the circulation as a result of increased synthesis of corticosteroids from the adrenocortical cells. Hence the current study also determined changes, if any, in the adrenal glands, especially the adrenocortical cells of laboratory and <b>hopping</b> <b>mice</b> following whole body heat exposure. Heat stress resulted in the formation of vacuoles, dilated capillaries and interstitial fibrosis in cortical areas of the adrenal glands in both the species. In addition, large syncytial bodies were evident in <b>hopping</b> <b>mice</b> adrenal cortical cells. Thus it is evident from the study that germ cell and sperm apoptosis are a result of either a direct effect of heat on germ cells and/ or due to changes in the body hormonal milieu following whole body heat stress. Thus this study showed an activation of caspases in producing germ cell apoptosis and externalization of PS in inducing sperm apoptosis following whole body heat stress with changes in the adrenocortical cells following heat stress. This study demonstrated that an aridadapted species Notomys alexis, although evolved in extreme environmental conditions, also is affected by high temperatures. Hence, this study gives some insight in the reasons for reduced fertility following whole body heat stress. Thesis (Ph. D.)

25|$|Seven {{species of}} native Australian rodent have become extinct {{and several others}} have {{significantly}} declined in numbers since the settlement of Europeans in Australia. These rodents make up 48% of the total mammals extinct in Western Australia. The <b>hopping</b> <b>mouse</b> was probably the first Australian mammal to succumb to European settlers. Hopping mice are vulnerable to agriculture and pastoralism, as well as introduced cats. During a plague, mice can comprise up to 100% of the diet of a feral cat, lending support to the theory that feral cats were {{the primary cause of}} their extinction.|$|E
25|$|By the 1850s, feral cats {{inhabited}} the Western Australian wheatbelt; they targeted {{a number of}} larger rodents throughout Western Australia. However, extinction occurred before the red fox came to Western Australia (Burbidge, 618). The big-eared <b>hopping</b> <b>mouse</b> had no defenses against Australia's introduced species. Its extinction can possibly be shown as a ramification of environmental alteration by humans, and predation is another likely possibility, but the true reason for the extinction is uncertain.

40|$|In most {{mammalian}} species, {{the temperature}} of scrotal testes is several degrees {{lower than that of}} core body temperature due to the presence of a counter-current heat exchange between the coiled testicular artery and the pampiniform plexus of veins. Here we ask: have <b>hopping</b> <b>mice</b> developed a highly efficient cooling mechanism within their scrotal sac and/or germ cell resistance to high environmental temperatures? To investigate this, adult male sexually mature Notomys alexis were used to determine: (1) {{the temperature of}} the testes; (2) the extent of coiling of the testicular artery; (3) the effect of artificially induced cryptorchidism on spermatogenesis up to three weeks after surgery; and (4) the effect of whole body heat exposure of 37 _ 38 _C for 8 h per day for three consecutive days on germ cell apoptosis. The results showed that in <b>hopping</b> <b>mice</b> the testicular artery, unlike that in most other mammalian species, is not coiled although the temperature in the scrotum was found to be ~ 2 _C lower than that of the abdomen. In cryptorchid males, 21 days after surgery, testes weights were reduced in three of five individuals but there was no statistically significant decrease after 16 h exposure to whole body heat (P = 0. 07). Nevertheless, some impairment of spermatogenesis was evident in both the cryptorchid testes and in the testes after whole body heating. These results show that in <b>hopping</b> <b>mice</b> developing male germ cells are susceptible to degeneration when testes are exposed to high environmental temperatures. Thus adaptations of Notomys alexis to the arid zone have not involved any special adaptations for male germ cell survival in a hot environment. Behavioural adaptations may play a pivotal role in maintaining maximal male fertility in such extreme environmental conditions. H. Wechalekar, B. P. Setchel, E. Peirce, C. Leigh and W. G. Bree...|$|R

40|$|Captive-bred Australian spinifex <b>hopping</b> <b>mice</b> Notomys alexis {{have very}} small testes {{regardless}} of their age. Compared with other rodents of similar body mass, these animals also produce and store comparatively low numbers of spermatozoa. In the present study, we thus ask the following questions: (1) what is the testis weight of sexually mature spinifex <b>hopping</b> <b>mice</b> in the natural environment and does this change {{at different times of}} reproductive activity of the population and (2) what is the fertility potential of adult sexually mature males? The results show that wild-caught individuals, like the captive-bred animals, invariably have very small testes, regardless of whether females in the population are, or are not, reproducing. Spermatogenesis continues at times when females are reproductively inactive, thus suggesting males may remain potentially able to inseminate females as soon as they enter oestrus. In spite of their very small testes and low epididymal sperm stores, an adult male can fertilize the ovulated oocytes of at least two females within a period of a few days. Thus, although sperm reserves are likely to be heavily depleted after the first ejaculation, males rapidly return to maximum fertility, which is no doubt due, at least in part, to the short sperm epididymal transit time that occurs in this species.
