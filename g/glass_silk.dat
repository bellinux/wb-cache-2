The Winkler Gallery of Fine Arts opened its doors in December 2003 as a co-op for local artists to display and sell their work to the public. The gallery hosts the annual DuBois Arts Festival. Along with supporting the local artist community, the gallery provides art education for the residents of the DuBois area through artist workshops in several mediums such as stained <b>glass,</b> <b>silk</b> painting, and watercolors.|$|E
40|$|How did {{manufacturers}} {{cope with}} {{innovation in the}} mercantilist age? In most sectors, innovation itself was conceived mainly as product innovation, even when new production processes were involved. In this perspective, also the discussed complementarity between mercantilist import-substituting imitation, and process and product innovation becomes clearer. The case of ceramics production in the Venetian Republic is particularly interesting, showing clearly that import substitution was the main drive of change in a manufacture which never attained in Venice the strategic importance of <b>glass,</b> <b>silk</b> and wool. Art historians have reconstructed a history of ceramics production sites at a local level, providing {{a detailed description of}} product typologies, useful to study their evolution, origin and diffusion. These studies show clearly that the decay of urban ceramic guilds {{in the second half of}} 17 th century pushed political authorities to grant privileges to private manufacturers producing fine majolica, then porcelain and in the late 18 th century earthenware, both in Venice and in some centres of its mainland. These studies indicate also a series of sources (pleas, privilege patents, trials, notarial acts, and the pieces preserved in museums and private collections), which are used here for an historical analysis of the institutional and informal devices allowing local production to adapt to European market trends and innovations. The logic of privilege allowance emerging from this analysis shows the political authorities of the Republic struggling to find a mechanism allowing private manufacturers to develop durable technical expertise in order to face the continuous waves of innovation in European ceramics typologies and production. Temporary monopolies, fiscal exemptions and restrictions to workforce mobility were the main institutional tools used to build up an industrial policy which could cope with product innovation as apprenticeship and cooptation did in the guild framework...|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{macroscopic}} objects contain ions {{distributed throughout}} the material, rigidly bound in place, giving an overall net positive or negative charge to the object. Also, macroscopic objects made of conductive elements, {{can more or less}} easily (depending on the element) take on or give off electrons, and then maintain a net negative or positive charge indefinitely. When the net electric charge of an object is non-zero and motionless, the phenomenon is known as static electricity. This can easily be produced by rubbing two dissimilar materials together, such as rubbing amber with fur or <b>glass</b> with <b>silk.</b> In this way non-conductive materials can be charged to a significant degree, either positively or negatively. Charge taken from one material is moved to the other material, leaving an opposite charge of the same magnitude behind. The law of conservation of charge always applies, giving the object from which a negative charge is taken a positive charge of the same magnitude, and vice versa.|$|R

40|$|Optimality theory {{predicts that}} females tend to {{maximize}} their offspring survival by choosing the egg- laying site.

To test this hypothesis, Tetranychus urticae Koch is an appropriate biological model {{as it is a}} phytophagous mite living in group, protected against external aggression by a common web. Experiments were conducted to determine the respective influence of substrate (living substrate: bean leaf vs. non-living substrate: <b>glass</b> plate), <b>silk</b> and presence of conspecific eggs on the egg-laying behavior of T. urticae females. On both living and non-living substrates, the presence of silk positively influenced the probability of a female to lay an egg, but had no influence on the number of eggs deposited.

The presence of a conspecific egg had no impact on either the probability of laying an egg or on the oviposition rate. This study showed a high variability among females in their fecundity and egg-laying performance.
