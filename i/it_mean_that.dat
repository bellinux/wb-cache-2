500|$|During {{his final}} years, Nielsen {{produced}} a short book of essays entitled Living Music (1925), followed in 1927 by his memoir Min Fynske Barndom. In 1926 {{he wrote in}} his diary [...] "My home soil pulls me more and more like a long sucking kiss. Does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> I shall finally return and rest in the earth of Funen? Then it must be in the place where I was born: Sortelung, Frydenlands parish".|$|E
500|$|The {{composition}} of [...] "Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya" [...] was especially time-consuming– {{on the day}} of the song's scheduled recording, Naushad rejected two sets of lyrics by Badayuni. Subsequently, a [...] "brainstorming session" [...] was held on Naushad's terrace, beginning in early evening and lasting until next day. Late in the night, Naushad remembered a folk song from eastern Uttar Pradesh with the lyrics [...] "Prem kiya, kya chori kari hai..." [...] ("I have loved, does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> I have stolen?"). The song was converted into a ghazal and subsequently recorded. At that time, since there was no technology to provide for the reverberation of sound heard in the song, Naushad had Mangeshkar sing the song in a studio bathroom. Some sources state that a chorus of a hundred singers supported singer Mohammed Rafi for the song [...] "Ae Mohabbat Zindabad", though other sources place the number at a thousand.|$|E

60|$|THE SERPENT. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> I fear {{certainty}} as {{you fear}} uncertainty. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> nothing is certain but uncertainty. If I bind the future I bind my will. If I bind my will I strangle creation.|$|R

[...] "It <b>means</b> <b>that</b> this flower is not developed in perpetual snow. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is first germinated {{in a warm}} soil and under a kindly sun. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> if you had not plucked it, it would have fulfilled its destiny under those conditions. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> in two months grass will be springing where you found it--even where we now lie.

"It means a {{good deal}} more. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> papa has had another reverse; <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> the assay has turned out badly for the mine--that the further they go from the flat the worse it gets--that all the gold they will {{probably}} ever see at Devil's Ford is what they have already found or will find on the flat; <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> all Devil's Ford is only a 'pocket,' and not a 'lead.'"

2500|$|Although, {{for many}} of the {{original}} founders of the Kibbutz, the arrival of children was a sobering experience: [...] "When we saw our first children in the playpen, hitting one another, or grabbing toys just for themselves, we were overcome with anxiety. What did <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> even an education in communal life couldn't uproot these egotistical tendencies? The utopia of our initial social conception was slowly, slowly destroyed." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{a narrow}} path {{for the moon}} to pass within the {{penumbra}} and outside the umbra. It can happen on the Earth's northern or southern penumbral edges. In addition, {{the size of the}} penumbra is sometimes too small where the moon enters it to contain the moon. The width of the Earth's penumbra is determined by the sun's angular diameter {{at the time of the}} eclipse, and the moon's angular diameter is larger than the sun over part of its elliptical orbit, depending on whether the eclipse occurs at its nearest (perigee) or farthest point (apogee) in its orbit around the earth. [...] The majority of the time, the size of the moon and the size of the Earth's penumbra where the moon crosses <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> most eclipses will not be total penumbral in nature.|$|E
2500|$|Writing for The London Review of Books in February 2017, Michael Wood {{characterized}} {{the film as}} a study of an inherited intergenerational tragedy. He wrote: [...] " [...] there are still ten minutes of late Ingmar Bergman to go. The film keeps showing us Chiron's handsome, inscrutable face. The silence doesn't tell us anything, it just asks us {{to feel sorry for}} him... All is not lost, though, because as we gaze at Chiron, we can think of something else: his resemblance to Juan (his father figure). Does <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Juan was once a Chiron... Not quite that perhaps, but the last shot of the film is of the young Chiron sitting on the beach... looking out at the ocean... His wide eyes suggest all the desolation and promise that Juan saw in him at the beginning. If we started again, would things be different?" ...|$|E
