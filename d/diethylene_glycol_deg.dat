50|$|The {{most common}} {{thermodynamic}} inhibitors are methanol, monoethylene glycol (MEG), and <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (<b>DEG),</b> {{commonly referred to}} as glycol. All may be recovered and recirculated, but the economics of methanol recovery is not favourable in most cases. MEG is preferred over DEG for applications where the temperature is expected to be &minus;10 °C or lower due to high viscosity at low temperatures. Triethylene glycol (TEG) has too low vapour pressure to be suited as an inhibitor injected into a gas stream. More methanol is lost in the gas phase when compared to MEG or DEG.|$|E

Adulteration of products with diethylene glycol has led to thousands of deaths worldwide since the first recorded case: the Elixir sulfanilamide incident in 1937. Most of the recalled wines contained up to a few grams of DEG per litre (and many {{only a fraction of}} a gram), which meant that dozens of bottles would have to be consumed in a limited period of time to reach the lethal dose of approximately 40 grams. However, in one record-setting wine (a 1981 Welschriesling Beerenauslese from Burgenland) 48 grams per litre was detected, which meant that the consumption of a single bottle could have been lethal. Also, long-term consumption of DEG is known to damage the kidney, liver and brain.|$|E
50|$|On May 5, 2007, upon {{purchasing}} {{a tube of}} toothpaste from the Vendela Discount Store in Panama City, Arias discovered that it contained <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (<b>DEG),</b> a toxic substance that had recently caused deaths as an ingredient of cough syrup.

On May 10, Dr. Camilo Alleyne, the top health official of the Panamian Government announced that DEG {{had been found in}} toothpaste being sold in Panama City. A national uproar resulted in an investigation, the results of which indicated that Chinese manufacturers were systematically using DEG as a thickening agent (in place of Glycerin, which is more commonly used, but is more expensive) at levels that were far above safety limits. Investigations have also indicated that counterfeiters in China, sometime using branded labels such as Colgate and Sensodyne, have managed to penetrate markets in Canada, United States, India and Nigeria.|$|E
