500|$|Many episodes {{written by}} Lawrence develop {{and explore the}} {{relationship}} between Karen and her husband. Lawrence has stated that he feels Karen makes Plankton-focused episodes more humorous and that her presence helps portray him as a multidimensional character. In a 2009 interview with Andy Goodman, he said, [...] "I want more Karen on the show... The married life of an evil genius is the funniest thing to me, so in that regard [...] definitely enhances Plankton's stories, making him more than <b>just</b> <b>your</b> typical bad guy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Daddy's Little Monster" [...] {{features}} two songs: [...] "Not <b>Just</b> <b>Your</b> Little Girl" [...] and [...] "Political Rap". The latter of the two, {{which went}} on to become particularly popular with fans of the series on the Internet, was written by Moynihan and intended for the episode [...] "Return to the Nightosphere". Together with other episodes of Cartoon Network programming, the episodes helped make the network the number one television destination for boys aged 2–11, 6–11, and 9–14 on Monday nights. Both episodes received largely positive critical reviews.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{are divided}} over the game's {{difficulty}} level and target audience. Some found the game {{too easy for}} adult players. Nintendo World Report's Lasse Pallesen stated Over the Hedge is not engaging to adults or children due to [...] "the repetitive collect-a-thon nature {{of the game and}} the one-dimensional gameplay". GameZone's Louis Bedigian had similar reservations, [...] "Players young and old will be turned off by the lack of excitement". Other reviewers felt the game was suitable for children and adults. Cheat Code Central's Cole Smith stated [...] "It's not just for kids. It's loaded with variety and will engage your mind, not <b>just</b> <b>your</b> reflexes". Deeko's Pete Sellers found the game [...] "a well designed adventure that requires patience and planning".|$|E
500|$|Two new roles– Garrett and Castillo– {{needed to}} be filled for the production. The actors {{selected}} were both Star Trek fans. Christopher McDonald was picked for Castillo. [...] "What impressed me about [...] ", Carson remembers, [...] "was that he wasn't <b>just</b> <b>your</b> romantic leading man; he was actually a very impressive actor." [...] Tricia O'Neil was cast for similar reasons; the actress was not the normal Star Trek commander type. Carson was also pleased to work with Crosby and Goldberg. The main cast enjoyed {{the opportunity to play}} their characters differently. The unusual degree of friction between characters provoked some concern with the producers. Berman, for example, was afraid that the episode was pushing the alternate timeline too far.|$|E

Sugar and Sanchez originally tried writing the song—which was originally {{to be called}} the [...] "Cone Zone"—together, but Sugar eventually completely rewrote it. When it came time to storyboard the episode, Sanchez with the help of former storyboard artist and then-creative director Adam Muto, storyboarded the scene, and Ward asked Sugar to record a quick demo of the song for reference. She filmed herself recording the demo, but jokingly noted that she asked [...] "Pen and Cole to face the other way" [...] out of embarrassment. The political rap featured in [...] "Daddy's Little Monster", written by Moynihan, was originally intended for [...] "Return to the Nightosphere", but was cut for time. Sugar, however, liked the song so much that she insisted it be added to [...] "Daddy's Little Monster". Moynihan was pleased with the largely positive critical reception the rap had from fans of the series.|$|E
500|$|Marceline {{shares a}} rocky {{relationship}} with Princess Bubblegum. Initially, {{in the series}} bible, the two were described as [...] "friendly rivals" [...] competing for Finn's attention. However, as the show has gone on, their relationship has been fleshed out and changed. Marceline {{was the first person}} to address Bubblegum by her first name—Bonnibel—which occurred in the episode [...] "Go with Me". Their connections are explored further in the season three episode [...] "What Was Missing". In the episode, Marceline's song [...] "I'm <b>Just</b> <b>Your</b> Problem" [...] and the dialogue between her and Bubblegum implied that there may have had some sort of relationship in the past, although the exact details surrounding the nature of the relationship were not explained. This later caused an internet controversy over Marceline's sexual orientation. However, after the events of [...] "What Was Missing", Marceline and Bubblegum's relationship seems to have gotten better, as the two spend quality time together in [...] "Sky Witch", [...] "Varmints", Stakes, and [...] "Broke His Crown".|$|E
500|$|She {{was very}} emotionally {{attached}} to her teddy bear Hambo, which was given to her by a still-human Simon Petrikov, as revealed in the episode [...] "I Remember You". In [...] "Memory of a Memory", after Ash sold the teddy bear to a witch, Marceline was furious and broke up with him. In the episode [...] "Sky Witch", Marceline enlists Princess Bubblegum's help, and they retrieve the bear, but in [...] "Betty", she sacrifices the bear {{in order to allow}} Simon the chance to communicate with his fiancée. Although she is very independent, her detachment often makes her feel alone, as seen in [...] "Marceline's Closet"; while Jake and Finn are hiding in her closet, she expresses most of her feeling via the writings of her 500-year-old diary. Throughout the series, Marceline is seen playing music; in several official sources, she is described as [...] "a wild rocker girl". Several times throughout the series, she jams with Finn and Jake, and various others depending on the circumstances. She is usually shown playing her axe bass, which was formerly her family's heirloom battle axe. According to Ward, she is ambidextrous, which explains her ability to play bass with both hands. [...] She often finds it easier to express her feelings through music, as seen with songs like the [...] "Fry Song", about her father, and [...] "I'm <b>Just</b> <b>Your</b> Problem", about her relationship with Princess Bubblegum.|$|E

500|$|... "Gehenna" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a C+, finding {{that it was}} [...] "almost completely crippled by ... self-seriousness". VanDerWerff felt that the episode reflected Millennium seeming simultaneously both [...] "intrinsically of the 1990s" [...] and [...] "ahead of its time", find that its treatment of [...] "the dread and shadowy fear and sense that the world held several cloaked and mysterious evils for well-to-do Americans" [...] was a symptom of 1990s preoccupation with [...] "the end of the world" [...] while foreshadowing {{the mood of the}} United States following the September 11 attacks in New York in 2001. As a result, VanDerWerff described the episode, and the series, as being [...] "the first post-Sept. 11 show". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, noting that there is [...] "more here than <b>just</b> <b>your</b> standard serial killer show". Gibron praised the episode's [...] "atypical storyline", which he felt was achieved through [...] "some suggestive effects and wonderful crosscutting". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it [...] "a somewhat humdrum story". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's core premise—that of [...] "a telemarking company being a front for a terrorist cult"—was intriguing, but that the [...] "millennial flavour" [...] that accompanies this resulted in the episode seeming [...] "a little confused".|$|E
2500|$|The film's dark, shadowy black-and-white, {{film noir}} {{cinematography}} {{was the work}} of John F. Seitz. Wilder had worked with him on several projects before, and trusted his judgment, allowing him to make his own decisions. Seitz recalled asking Wilder what he required for the pet chimpanzee's funeral scene. Wilder replied, [...] "you know, <b>just</b> <b>your</b> standard monkey funeral shot." [...] For some interior shots, Seitz sprinkled dust {{in front of the camera}} before filming to suggest [...] "mustiness," [...] a trick he had also used for Double Indemnity (1944).|$|E
2500|$|Hippies {{embraced the}} old slogan of free {{love of the}} radical social reformers of other eras; it was {{accordingly}} observed that [...] "Free love made the whole love, marriage, sex, baby package obsolete. Love was no longer limited to one person, you could love anyone you chose. In fact love was something you shared with everyone, not <b>just</b> <b>your</b> sex partners. Love exists to be shared freely. We also discovered the more you share, the more you get! So why reserve your love for a select few? This profound truth {{was one of the}} great hippie revelations." [...] Sexual experimentation alongside psychedelics also occurred, due to the perception of their being uninhibitors. Others explored the spiritual aspects of sex.|$|E

2500|$|Her first space mission {{began on}} November 19, 1997, {{as part of}} the six-astronaut crew that flew the Space Shuttle Columbia flight STS-87. Chawla was the first Indian-born woman and the second Indian person to fly in space, {{following}} astronaut Rakesh Sharma who flew in 1984 on the Soyuz T-11. She spoke the following words while traveling in the weightlessness of space, [...] "You are <b>just</b> <b>your</b> intelligence". On her first mission, Chawla traveled over 10.4 million miles (16737177.6 K M) in 252 orbits of the earth, logging more than 372 hours (15 Days and 12 Hours) in space. During STS-87, she was responsible for deploying the Spartan satellite which malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by Winston Scott and Takao Doi to capture the satellite. A five-month NASA investigation fully exonerated Chawla by identifying errors in software interfaces and the defined procedures of flight crew and ground control. After the completion of STS-87 post-flight activities, Chawla was assigned to technical positions in the astronaut office to work on the space station.|$|E

[...] Edge also panned most of the core gameplay, saying [...] "the lacklustre combat, the imprecise platforming, the lack of meaningful feedback, the repetitive hunting for keys to locked doors, the over-fussy map, the intolerable cover system and the poor signposting that will leave even the most attentive player floundering for direction and purpose.
