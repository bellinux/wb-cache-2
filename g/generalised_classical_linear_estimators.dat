40|$|Abstract. A {{sequential}} <b>linear</b> <b>estimator</b> {{is developed}} {{in this study}} to progressively incorporate new or different spatial data sets into the estimation. It begins with a <b>classical</b> <b>linear</b> <b>estimator</b> (i. e., kriging or cokriging) to estimate means conditioned to a given observed data set. When an additional data set becomes available, the sequential estimator improves the previous estimate by using linearly weighted sums of differences between the new data set and previous estimates at sample locations. Like the <b>classical</b> <b>linear</b> <b>estimator,</b> the weights used in the sequential <b>linear</b> <b>estimator</b> are derived from a system of equations that contains covariances and cross-covariances between sample locations and the location where the estimate is to be made. However, the covariances and crosscovariances are conditioned upon the previous data sets. The sequential estimator is shown to produce the best, unbiased linear estimate, and to provide the same estimates and variances as classic simple kriging or cokriging with the simultaneous use of the entire data set. However, by using data sets sequentially, this new algorithm alleviates numerical dif®culties associated with the classical kriging or cokriging techniques when {{a large amount of}} data are used. It also provides a new way to incorporate additional information into a previous estimation.

Unfortunately, such a scheme cannot be implemented in a practical bandwidth-constrained sensor network due to its requirement to transmit real-valued messages. In this paper, we construct a decentralized estimation scheme (DES) where each sensor compresses its observation to a small number of bits with length proportional to the logarithm of its local signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The resulting compressed bits from different sensors are then collected and combined by the fusion center to estimate the unknown parameter. The proposed DES is universal in the sense that each sensor compression scheme requires only the knowledge of local SNR, rather than the noise probability distribution functions (pdf), while the final fusion step is also independent of the local noise pdfs.
