40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} patients' {{perceptions of}} the benefits and problems associated with using the ActiGait implanted <b>drop-foot</b> stimulator. METHOD: Thirteen participants who had suffered a stroke at least 6 months prior to recruitment, had a <b>drop-foot</b> that affected walking and had taken part in a trial in which an ActiGait <b>drop-foot</b> stimulator had been implanted, completed a postal questionnaire. RESULTS: Users agreed that the ActiGait had {{a positive effect on}} walking; they used it regularly and had little difficulty with putting it on and taking it off. Reliability was a greater problem at 90 days than at the final assessment. Ten of the 13 responders either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that the ActiGait improved their quality of life at 90 days and 9 out of 12 at the final assessment: 11 of the 12 respondents would recommend the ActiGait to others.

40|$|Abstract—An active ankle-foot orthoses (AAFO) is {{presented}} where {{the impedance of}} the orthotic joint is modulated throughout the walking cycle to treat <b>drop-foot</b> gait. During controlled plantar flexion, a biomimetic torsional spring control is applied where orthotic joint stiffness is actively adjusted to minimize forefoot collisions with the ground. Throughout late stance, joint impedance is minimized {{so as not to}} impede powered plantar flexion movements, and during the swing phase, a torsional spring-damper control lifts the foot to provide toe clearance. To assess the clinical effects of variable-impedance control, kinetic and kinematic gait data were collected on two <b>drop-foot</b> participants wearing the AAFO. For each participant, zero, constant, and variable impedance control strategies were evaluated and the results were compared to the mechanics of three age, weight, and height matched normals. We find that actively adjusting joint impedance reduces the occurrence of slap foot allows greater powered plantar flexion and provides for less kinematic difference during swing when compared to normals. These results indicate that a variable-impedance orthosis may have certain clinical benefits for the treatment of <b>drop-foot</b> gait compared to conventional ankle-foot orthoses having zero or constant stiffness joint behaviors.

40|$|Robotic {{technologies}} are being employed increasingly {{in the treatment}} of lower limb disabilities. Individuals suffering from stroke and other neurological disorders often experience inadequate dorsiflexion during swing phase of the gait cycle due to dorsiflexor muscle weakness. This type of pathological gait, mostly known as <b>drop-foot</b> gait, has two major complications, foot-slap during loading response and toe-drag during swing. Ankle foot orthotic (AFO) devices are mostly prescribed to resolve these complications. Existing AFOs are designed with or without articulated joint with various motion control elements like springs, dampers, four-bar mechanism, series elastic actuator, and so forth. This paper examines various AFO designs for <b>drop-foot,</b> discusses the mechanism, and identifies limitations and remaining design challenges. Along with two commercially available AFOs some designs possess promising prospective to be used as daily-wear device.

40|$|A three {{dimensional}} inertial {{sensing system}} for measuring foot movements during gait is proposed and tested. It can {{form the basis}} for an automated tuning system for a two-channel implantable <b>drop-foot</b> stimulator. The foot orientation and position during the swing phase of gait can be reconstructed on the basis of three-dimensional measurement of acceleration and angular velocity, using initial and final conditions during mid-stance. The foot movements during gait of one stroke person using the implanted two-channel stimulator were evaluated for several combinations of stimulation parameters for both channels. The reconstructed foot movements during gait in this person indicated that the channel stimulating the deep peroneal nerve contributes mainly to dorsiflexion and provides some reduction of inversion seen without stimulation, while the channel activating the superficial peroneal nerve mainly provides additional reduction of inversion. This agrees with anatomical knowledge about the function of the muscles activated by both branches of the peroneal nerve. The inertial sensor method is expected to be useful for the clinical evaluation of foot movements during gait supported by the two-channel <b>drop-foot</b> stimulator. Furthermore, it is expected to be applicable for the automated balancing of the two stimulation channels to ensure optimal support of gait...|$|E

40|$|Stroke affects 700, 000 Americans {{per year}} {{resulting}} in the largest cause of long-term disability in the United States. <b>Drop-foot</b> is a common condition associated with residual disabilities of stokes and is characterized as a paralysis or weakness of the dorsiflexor muscles of the foot and ankle. The result is an abnormal gait cycle caused by the dragging of the foot and toes during the swing phase. This device attempts to incorporate key principles from Electromyography (EMG) biofeedback rehabilitation and active Ankle-Foot Orthosis (AFO) design into a single rehabilitation device.

One hundred and five patients with a first-ever anterior circulation stroke without full voluntary ankle dorsiflexion in standing position following the Fugl-Meyer motor score at 72 h were included for further analysis. Determinants were measured within 72 h, and at days 5 and 9 after stroke onset. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to predict the recovery of full ankle dorsiflexion while standing at 6 months. Having the item 'Motricity Index ankle dorsiflexion 19 or more (full range of motion ankle dorsiflexion againsts gravity) ' was the best predictive variable. The sensitivity was 0. 74 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 62 - 0. 80], specificity was 0. 72 (95 % CI 0. 62 - 0. 81), positive predictive value was 0. 74 (95 % CI 0. 63 - 0. 82), and negative predictive value was 0. 71 (95 % CI 0. 60 - 0. 80). No significant changes at day 5 and 9 after stroke were found. In stroke patients, the presence of full ankle dorsiflexion against gravity within 72 h is an accurate predictor for the absence of a <b>drop-foot</b> at 6 months.

A 12 -month follow-up was proposed in CNRFR, Rehazenter to these patients composed of 4 assessments (1 month before implantation and 3, 6 and 12 months after implantation). At each assessment, a 10 -m walk test, a 6 -min walk test, a four-square step test and a clinical gait analysis were performed. A t-test was used to evaluate the improvement of each parameter with confidence level of 95 %. ResultsMost of the followed parameters, such as gait symmetry, foot/ankle kinematics and balance, are significantly improved after implantation. However, the 10 -m walk test does not show any significant gait velocity improvement. Similarly, no significant effect appears on the compensations developed during gait. Even if the stimulator mainly has an orthotic effect, a therapeutic effect is shown for this patient group on the foot prepositioning in dorsiflexion at foot strike. DiscussionUnlike recent results reported in the literature [1], gait velocity does not seem to be impacted by the use of the stimulator during gait. However, the global quality of gait is improved, with a better gait symmetry, a reduced risk of falling and a better balance. The use of an implantable peroneal nerve stimulator in the <b>drop-foot</b> treatment of stroke survivors is encouraging.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{functional}} effects and mechanical contribution of Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO) prescribed to overcome <b>drop-foot</b> gait. We hypothesized that poor functional effects of the AFO relate to insufficient mechanical contribution of the AFO during the swing phase, or unwanted constraining of the ankle during the stance phase. In seven patients with Stroke or Multiple Sclerosis, we determined changes in energy cost of walking resulting from wearing an AFO, as a measure of the functional effects. In addition, an instrumented gait analysis was performed, and the mechanical AFO properties were measured, to calculate the mechanical contribution of the AFO. The AFO was sufficiently stiff to effectively support the foot in swing, without hampering the ankle during stance. For the whole group, there was a significant improvement in walking speed and energy cost (12). However, the AFO had no functional benefit in terms of a reduced energy cost of walking for three patients, who coherently demonstrated no pathological plantar flexion during swing without their AFO. We conclude that functional benefit from the AFO was only found when the mechanical AFO characteristics met the need to support the patients' mechanical deficiencies. © 2010 ISPO...|$|E
40|$|The {{interosseous}} route remains {{popular for}} tibialis posterior tendon transfer for <b>drop-foot.</b> It leaves a smaller {{range of movement}} than the circumtibial route, but lengthening the calcaneal tendon may improve this. The results of this present series indicate that, in order to predict a good functional result, the ankle must be held in at least 200 of dorsifiexion {{at the time of}} tendon transfer. Transfer ofthe tibialis posterior is indicated for supinated equinovarus deformity of the foot in which the muscle is a deforming force, and therefore especially suitable for transfer to act as an active dorsiflexor. The operation aims to improve gait by providing an active balanced transfer which will obviate the need for a foot-drop splint, or for a posterior bone block (Ingram 1987).

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1960 s, {{electrical}} or neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) {{has been used}} to support the rehabilitation of stroke patients. One of the earliest applications of NMES included the use of external muscle stimulation to correct <b>drop-foot</b> after stroke. During the last few decades various clinical applications have been used for the upper and lower limb. Despite a growing body of literature on the use of NMES, its application in stroke is still limited to a few clinical groups that provide dedicated clinical services.

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{introduces}} {{an approach}} to the FES-assisted correction of the <b>drop-foot</b> syndrome in post-stroke hemiplegic patients. The approach {{is based on a}} two stage architecture. One stage is dedicated to the online estimation of high-level gait information and the second to the generation of optimal ankle joint trajectories for walking assistance. The general gait information is obtained through the observation of one limb based on a central pattern generator model generating rhythmic trajectories which auto-adapt to real-measurements. This allows us to obtain information about the execution of the walking cycle. Optimal control is used to generate ankle joint dorsi-flexion trajectories during the swing phase of the corresponding deficient leg based on a muscle model and on the information provided by the first stage and some estimated or measured information about the controlled leg. This allows us to minimize a criteria linked to muscle activation, excitation or fatigue while satisfying constraints such as ground clearance, instead of just mimicking a priori chosen foot ankle trajectories which may be suboptimal. The strategy is validated in simulation using experimental data recorded in one healthy subject...|$|E
40|$|The {{different}} procedures which formerly {{were employed}} for the correction of <b>drop-foot</b> {{have been somewhat}} disappointing,- as, for instance, the silk ligaments, fascia lata, and tendon implantations or dis-placements. These are uncertain, as the constant force of gravity results in an elongation of the ligaments. The astragalectomy of Whitman is not applicable to all paralyzed feet. The triple arthrodesis gives disadvantage in walking on irregular ground, and also the difficulty of adjusting an extension shoe when the limb is short. Because the results are unsatisfactory, particularly in the lack of permanency of the correction, one is inclined to employ for this purpose a posterior arthrodesis.

Selective stimulation of muscles tibialis anterior (TA) and the peroneus brevis (PB) that contribute to strong dorsal flexion and moderate eversion of the foot was achieved with a monopolar half-cuff (cuff) installed on the nerve behind the lateral head of the fibula. Results show that a selective and gradual recruitment of fibres within the CPN innervating aforementioned muscles was achieved. This could be attributed to the current, charge balanced, and biphasic stimuli with a rectangular cathodic, and exponential decaying anodic component delayed for 50 µs which were employed for stimulation. Results of gait analysis demonstrate significant improvements of gait without excessive eversion. They also show that the velocity of natural gait, cadence and stride length were significantly increased. However, the natural gait of the patient was still slower than in healthy individual. Results also show that the dorsal/plantar angular velocity of unstimulated foot could be estimated as higher than the angular velocity of stimulated foot. Electrophysiological findings have not revealed any reliable sign which could be attributed to the damage of the CPN induced by the cuff or by the stimuli applied for seven years.

Indices that categorise and quantify different patterns of calf and anterior tibial muscle activation patterns during treadmill walking have been derived from a sample of fifteen individuals with established hemiplegia following stroke and twelve age-matched individuals without impairment. As subjects walked on a treadmill, force sensitive foot-switches under the heel and first metatarsal head allowed EMG signals from the calf and anterior tibial muscles to be related to phases of the gait cycle. Normal activation periods for each muscle group were identified as percentiles of the gait cycle and indices for muscle activation periods were derived using ratios of integrated EMG during selected periods. Indices were derived that identified statistically significant differences, between normal and hemiplegic subjects, in calf activation during both push-off phase (P< 0. 001) and early stance phase (P< 001), but not activation of tibialis anterior during swing (P= 0. 325) Observation suggested that integrated tibialis anterior activity during swing phase in hemiplegic subjects was not dissimilar to normal subjects, but the profile in hemiplegic subjects tended to lack the normal second peak of activity at initial foot contact.

However, due to this features, it will not provide individualized comfort and functionality. Second method of obtaining AFO is by using traditional custom-made technique which is laborious and time-consuming manual process and can only be accomplished by expert orthotists.

40|$|Automatic {{control of}} ankle-joint angle for the {{correction}} of <b>drop-foot</b> {{has been investigated}} using Bio-Impedance (BI) for measuring the joint angle and Iterative Learning Control (ILC) for adjusting the stimulation profile. A customised four-channel measurement system (50 kHz) {{was used to assess}} bio-impedance changes caused by ankle-joint motion. Two current excitation electrodes were placed below the patella on the shank and on the dorsum of the foot. Voltage detection electrodes were attached to the posterior surface of lower leg below the calf and on the M. tibialis anterior close to its origin. A demodulation circuit determines changes in the absolute value of the BI from the measured and amplified voltage. All circuits are protected against stimulation artefacts so that the recording of BI is possible while muscle stimulation is active. Calibration of the angle measurement was performed by positioning the ankle joint at three known angles. Reference measurements were taken with a marker-based optical system. Dorsiflexion of the unconstrained ankle joint was achieved by stimulation of the M. tibialis anterior. First-order ILC was applied to realise a pre-defined angle profile in a cycle-to-cycle manner. The new stimulation intensity profile will be an update of the last profile taking tracking errors of the last cycle into account. Preliminary experiments were conducted with one able-bodied subject. An almost linear correlation between ankle-joint angle and bio-impedance was found for the angle range applicable during gait. The chosen angle trajectory (sine half-wave from the resting foot to 0 degree) was realised by the ILC within 3 cycles. The final root mean square tracking error was below 5 degree. Automatic control of ankle-joint angle by ILC is feasible when using bio-impedance as sensory information. Experiments under real walking conditions and with stroke patients must be conducted in future...|$|E
40|$|Every year stroke affects {{approximately}} 15 {{million people}} worldwide. It {{is the leading}} cause of disability in the western world. Gait relearning has high priority for stroke survivors. One of the most commonly treated effects of stroke gait is <b>drop-foot</b> (the inability to raise the toes during the swing). However, push-off is also severely diminished during stroke gait. Electromyography (EMG) results show that all muscles of the affected (paretic) side have decreased physiological activation. Reduction and premature activation of the triceps surae leads to poor push-off. Our goal was to stimulate the triceps surae using functional electrical stimulation to increase the activation of this muscle group. EMG of the stimulated muscle and other leg muscles of legs was measured, simultaneously. The aim was to evaluate how stimulation influences the activation patterns of the stimulated and non-stimulated muscles. Tests were first carried out on healthy subjects. Surface stimulation was applied to the tibial nerve, which activates the triceps surae. Stimulation timing was controlled using a uniaxial gyroscope on the lateral shank. Stimulation bursts of 300 ms duration, 50 Hz was applied at each step. EMG of the medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, semitendinosus and rectus femoris of both legs was measured at 2048 Hz. Responses between each stimulation pulse were analysed, for motor and reflexive signals. Additionally, the amplitude changes and the on and offset times of EMG bursts were analysed. Results: While FES influenced the activation patterns of healthy and stroke subjects on the stimulated and non-stimulated sides, the effects were considerably varied. Motor and or reflexive responses in the stimulated gastrocnemius were observed in healthy and stroke. In healthy subjects, responses were also observed in the tibilais anterior of the stimulated side. Less clear changes were seen in the physiological on and offset timings. Future studies should involve a larger test group with more strictly defined patient criteria. Using percutaneous or implantable stimulation electrodes, stimulation levels can be reduced; by-passing cutaneous sensation and preventing recruitment instability since the electrode would be in direct contact with the nerve. Finally, subjects should undergo a training program to facilitate gait while using FES...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the efforts to}} develop control strategies that use EMG signals from the anterior tibialis muscle to control ankle torque in an active ankle-foot orthosis. This would ultimately help rehabilitate persons affected by <b>drop-foot</b> gait, a condition which results {{in the loss of}} ability to dorsi-flex the ankle. This causes dropping of the toe during the swing phase of walking and "slapping down" of the foot after heel strike. Alleviation of these gait anomalies would improve mobility efficiency, safety, and cosmesis. Several types of orthotic devices fitted with springs and/or dampers have been used to control torque around the ankle and consequently facilitate the natural pattern of movement during the gait cycle. However, recent studies on powered upper-extremity orthoses controlled by EMGsignals from the users' impaired muscles have produced an unexpected and potentially exciting result. The use of EMG-controlled orthoses seems to improve the user's ability to control the compromised muscles and subsequently rebuild the connection between the brain and the output of those muscles. This could be a crucial step in helping stroke patients make a full recovery. (cont.) Extending this control scheme to a powered ankle orthosis requires understanding the relationship between ankle torque and EMG signals measured on the muscles likely to serve as control signal sites. Studies have shown that the muscle whose deterioration is most responsible for drop foot gait is the tibialis anterior. Thus, this thesis focuses on the relationship between EMG from the tibialis anterior and ankle torque. Experiments show that there is a clear pattern of EMG peak periods and silent periods throughout the gait cycle. However the magnitudes of these peaks are very similar and thus require a revision in the EMG control strategy used in the upper extremity orthoses which output a position of the brace via the EMG profile of the muscles around it. The control strategies devised involve using other inputs in addition to EMG, including foot switches and position sensors, to supplement the EMG control scheme in a new version of an active ankle foot orthosis. by Elizabeth C.

40|$|Background: With growing {{emphasis}} on patient involvement in health technology assessment, {{there is a}} need for scientific methods that formally elicit patient preferences. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and conjoint analysis (CA) are two established scientific methods – albeit with very different objectives. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the performance of AHP and CA in eliciting patient preferences for treatment alternatives for stroke rehabilitation. Methods: Five competing treatments for <b>drop-foot</b> impairment in stroke were identified. One survey, including the AHP and CA questions, was sent to 142 patients, resulting in 89 patients for final analysis (response rate 63 %). Standard software was used to calculate attribute weights from both AHP and CA. Performance weights for the treatments were obtained from an expert panel using AHP. Subsequently, the mean predicted preference for each of the five treatments was calculated using the AHP and CA weights. Differences were tested using non-parametric tests. Furthermore, all treatments were rank ordered for each individual patient, using the AHP and CA weights. Results: Important attributes in both AHP and CA were the clinical outcome (0. 3 in AHP and 0. 33 in CA) and risk of complications (about 0. 2 in both AHP and CA). Main differences between the methods were found for the attributes ‘impact of treatment’ (0. 06 for AHP and 0. 28 for two combined attributes in CA) and ‘cosmetics and comfort’ (0. 28 for two combined attributes in AHP and 0. 05 for CA). On a group level, the most preferred treatments were soft tissue surgery (STS) and orthopedic shoes (OS). However, STS was most preferred using AHP weights versus OS using CA weights (p 50 % of the patients chose OS instead of STS, as most preferred treatment using CA weights. Conclusion: While we found differences between AHP and CA, these differences were most likely caused by the labeling of the attributes and the elicitation of performance judgments. CA scenarios are built using the level descriptions, and hence provide realistic treatment scenarios. In AHP, patients only compared less concrete attributes such as ‘impact of treatment. ’ This led to less realistic choices, and thus overestimation of the preference for the surgical scenarios. Several recommendations are given on how to use AHP and CA in assessing patient preferences...|$|E
