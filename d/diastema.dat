5|$|<b>Diastema</b> is a {{condition}} {{in which there is a}} gap between two teeth caused by the imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of teeth.|$|E
5|$|On the mandible, the <b>diastema</b> is {{very large}} and the incisor is procumbent (projecting forward), which distinguishes Apeomyoides from most eomyids apart from Megapeomys. There is a masseteric scar (associated with the jaw muscles) from below the m1 forward to a point in front of p4, below the mental foramen, {{an opening in the}} jawbone. In Apeomys and Megapeomys this scar only reaches {{to the level of the}} front root of p4. The mental foramen is very small and opens in the <b>diastema,</b> near the ventral shelf of the scar; in Apeomys and Megapeomys it is located near the dorsal shelf. Further {{foramina}} are present on the lingual (inner) surface of the bone, below the cheekteeth.|$|E
5|$|Both Abrictosaurus and Heterodontosaurus {{had very}} large eyes. Underneath the eyes, the jugal bone {{projected}} sideways, a feature {{also present in}} ceratopsians. As in the jaws of most ornithischians, the anterior edge of the premaxilla (a bone {{at the tip of}} the upper jaw) was toothless and probably supported a keratinous beak (rhamphotheca), although heterodontosaurids did have teeth in the posterior section of the premaxilla. A large gap, called a <b>diastema,</b> separated these premaxillary teeth from those of the maxilla (the main upper jaw bone) in many ornithischians, but this <b>diastema</b> was characteristically arched in heterodontosaurids. The mandible (lower jaw) was tipped by the predentary, a bone unique to ornithischians. This bone also supported a beak similar to the one found on the premaxilla. All the teeth in the lower jaw were found on the dentary bone.|$|E

5|$|A single {{mandible}} from Porto Spanjo (one of {{the sites}} where fossils of A.donovani have been found), without preserved molars, differs from all Agathaeromys dentaries and is thought to represent an unknown different sigmodontine rodent. This jaw is more slender than A.donovani dentaries, has a shorter <b>diastema</b> (gap) between the incisors and molars, has the incisor less shifted lingually relative to the molars, and has more roots under the molars, {{as shown by the}} preserved alveoli.|$|E
5|$|In the mandible, the <b>diastema</b> (gap) {{between the}} incisors and the cheekteeth (premolars and molars) is {{relatively}} deep. The mental foramen (an {{opening in the}} bone) is located relatively high and before the p4. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which are located on the outer side of the jaw and anchor some of the chewing muscles, meet at the m1. The surfaces of the incisor are very flat, but there are small, irregular striations in the enamel {{along the length of}} the tooth.|$|E
40|$|When tooth mass is {{less than}} the size of the arch inwhich it is contained, the {{resultant}} effect is spacing. This can present in a minor fashion involving only a slight space between teeth, or may present in a more major way, exhibiting large space areas between two or more teeth. Most commonly we see this in the upper anterior teeth. The spacing between the central incisors is that area that usually signals an aesthetic concern. However, <b>diastemas</b> between central / laterals, laterals/cuspids and even cuspid/bicuspids often coexist in the patient with <b>diastemas</b> between the central incisors.

Methods: Two standardized oblique photos of pleasant smiles from two white women were selected. Images were digitally altered to create <b>diastemas</b> in the lateral incisor, in 0. 5 -mm increments, in the mesial, distal, or both surfaces. Final images were randomly assembled in a photo album, which was given to 120 judges— 60 orthodontists and 60 laypersons. Each rater was asked to evaluate the attractiveness of the images on a visual analog scale. The data collected were submitted to statistical analysis by the means of one-way ANOVA with the Tukey post hoc test and the unpaired Student's t test. Results: The most attractive smile was the one without spacing, and the presence of <b>diastemas</b> was considered unattractive by both groups of raters, following a pattern: the greater and the more mesially located, the more unattractive was the smile.

5|$|The dentary (lower jaw bone) {{itself is}} robust and short. The length {{axis of the}} p4 makes an angle of about 58° with the length axis of the jawbone. The bone is concave on the lingual, but convex on the labial side. There is a <b>diastema</b> (gap) between the p4 and the incisor {{that would have been}} in front of it, as in the jaw of Sudamerica. Gurovich {{estimated}} the length of the <b>diastema</b> as 2.5mm. There is a rounded mental foramen (an opening in the labial side of the jawbone), with a diameter of 0.7mm, located about 0.8mm below the dorsal margin of the bone and 1.5mm in front of the p4. Although the incisor itself is not preserved, its alveolus (the housing of the root) is in part. As in Sudamerica, it extends far into the dentary, passing below p4. The alveolus is 1.5mm wide below the front root of p4 and 1.4mm {{at the back of the}} jaw fragment. Although the height of the alveolus cannot be determined because the lower side is broken away, the incisor must have been quite deep.|$|E

Aim: The aim of this case report was to show our management of multiple <b>diastemas</b> whit noninvasive method. Material and Method: A 37 -year old male patient came to our clinic searching for fast and economic solution for his unsatisfactory smile appearance. Thought clinical examination multiple <b>diastemas</b> were found (around 2 mm wide or less) between central incisors, central and lateral incisor, lateral incisor and canine in {{the left and right}} maxillary quadrant and poor tooth proportion. There was an old direct composite veneer on the tooth number 9, so we removed it. A wax- up was made for visualization and treatment plan. This case was additive, meaning that tooth reduction is not necessary. Final impressions were taken and sent to the laboratory where six veneers were made with technical composite (Adoro® Ivoclar Vivadent). After try-in the veneers were cemented adhesively, with total etch technique by light curing cement. This report includes the data of a one year follow-up. There were no signs of any kind of changes in the restorations. Conclusions: Beside long term orthodontic and extensive prosthodontic treatment, multiple <b>diastemas</b> can be easily closed with very comfortable and nonaggressive solution, with highly esthetic results.

When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E
5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{may also}} play a {{secondary}} role in olfaction, which {{may account for the}} size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors. The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur. Furthermore, the size reduction of the upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth (interincisal <b>diastema)</b> that connects the philtrum (a cleft {{in the middle of the}} wet nose, or rhinarium) to the vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth. This would allow pheromones to be more easily transferred to the vomeronasal organ.|$|E

These features are shared among male Old World monkeys. Saadanius lacks the advanced frontal sinus found in living catarrhines, but it does possess an ectotympanic, or bony ear tube, found in living catarrhines.

5|$|By the 1980s, most {{researchers}} considered the heterodontosaurids {{as a distinct}} family of primitive ornithischian dinosaurs, but with an uncertain position with respect to other groups within the order.

Heterodontosauridae was defined as a clade by Sereno in 1998 and 2005, and the group shares skull features such as three or fewer teeth in each premaxilla, caniniform teeth followed by a <b>diastema,</b> and a jugal horn below the eye. In 2017, similarities between the skeletons of Heterodontosaurus and the early theropod Eoraptor were used to suggest that ornithischians should be grouped with theropods in a group called Ornithoscelida. Traditionally, theropods have been grouped with sauropodomorphs in the group Saurischia.|$|E

Patients and methods: A total of 28 children affected by DD (22 boys, six girls; mean age: 9. 78 ± 1. 69 years) were compared with 51 healthy children (38 boys, 13 girls; mean age 9. 41 ± 1. 48; range 7 – 10 years). Reading and writing skills were evaluated along with orthodontic features. Results: The DD and control groups were not significantly different in terms of total intelligence quotient (P = 0. 441) and writing skills (P = 0. 805 and P = 0. 240, respectively), whereas significant differences were observed between the DD group and control group in both word reading (2. 018 ± 1. 714 vs 0. 917 ± 0. 563; P = 0. 000) and non-word reading (2. 537 ± 1. 543 vs 0. 862 ± 0. 244; P = 0. 000). Moreover, for many orthodontic features, {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups; only in prevalence of <b>diastemas</b> (57. 14 %, P = 0. 006), midline <b>diastemas</b> (46. 42 %, P = 0. 007), overbite > 4 mm (71. 42 %, P = 0. 006) and overjet > 4 mm (53. 57 %, P = 0. 001), was there a statistically significant difference. According to univariate logistic regression analysis, the presence of <b>diastemas</b> (odds ratio [OR] 4. 33; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 61 – 11. 65), midline <b>diastemas</b> (OR 4. 68; 95 % CI 1. 61 – 13. 43), an overbite > 4 mm (OR 1. 75; 95 % CI 0. 64 – 4. 71), or an overjet > 4 mm (OR 2. 76; 95 % CI 1. 06 – 7. 20) seems to play a role in the relationship between occlusal abnormalities and DD in children.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} undergraduate students in diagnosing Angle Class II malocclusion and evaluate the clinical approach of these students toward a patient displaying this condition. METHODS: The sample consisted of 138 students attending the last semester of 10 dental schools in the State of Rio de Janeiro/Brazil assessed by questionnaires with closed questions. They were presented with photographs and dental casts of a patient in the mixed dentition, with Angle Class II malocclusion, increased overjet and overbite, deviated dental midlines and anterior <b>diastemas</b> in the upper arch. RESULTS: It was found that students easily identified increased overjet (92 % of students), followed {{by the presence of}} <b>diastemas</b> (89 %), midline deviation (84. 7 %) and increased overbite (77. 3 %). Conversely, approximately half the sample (n= 70 or 51 % of the students) were able to identify bilateral Angle Class II malocclusion.

Methods In the inter-arch relations the sagittal, vertical and transverse aspects were evaluated, and in the intra-arch relations, <b>diastemas,</b> crowding and tooth losses were determined in 670 children. The maloclussion was classified as Class I, II and III according to Angle, based on the position of the first molars. For this study, the sample was divided into two age groups: children from 7 to 9 years and children from 10 to 12 years old. Results A similar percentage of individuals with Class I and II was found in the two age groups evaluated. A higher percentage of Class III individuals was observed in the age group from 10 to 12 years.
