The main issue here is inequality between <b>doctor</b> <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> in their relationship, which is based more on factual inequality than inequality in rights. The <b>patient</b> as consumer <b>and</b> therefore the weaker party has limited access to relevant information concerning the subject of the relationship between <b>doctor</b> <b>and</b> <b>patient.</b> On the other hand, a doctor is a subject which has in its power almost all the relevant information.

This inequality, which arises in the relationship always, is not sufficiently addressed by the substantive regulation and its effects are present in subsequent court proceedings {{in the form of an}} information deficit. Intention of this paper is to present the fundamentals of the relationship between physician <b>and</b> <b>patient,</b> the reasons for the information deficit and its consequences in legal proceedings and ways of its compensation.

40|$|This chapter {{offers the}} {{beginnings}} of an exploration of what counts as exploitative sexual activity between a <b>doctor</b> <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> of what role (if any) the criminal law should play. The issue of maintaining sexual boundaries between health care professionals <b>and</b> <b>patients</b> has become a significant matter of concern in recent years following several high profile scandals. Ethical and regulatory guidance takes the position that any engagement in sexual activity with a patient by a <b>doctor</b> is inappropriate <b>and</b> damaging. In this chapter, we first explore why {{this might be the}} case and whether sexual activity between <b>doctor</b> <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> is always exploitative. We consider whether consent can ever really freely be given {{in the context of this}} relationship. Does the imbalance of power between <b>doctor</b> <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> mean that the health care professional always effectively thwarts the patient’s capacity to give free consent to sexual activity? Secondly, we assess whether criminal law should be utilised to deal with cases where sexual activity with a patient amounts to wrongful, harmful behaviour on the part of the doctor...|$|R

25|$|Sexual {{relationships}} between <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>patients</b> can create ethical conflicts, since sexual consent may {{conflict with the}} fiduciary responsibility of the physician. Out of the many disciplines in current medicine, there are {{studies that have been}} conducted in order to ascertain the occurrence of Doctor-Patient sexual misconduct. Results from those studies appear to indicate that certain disciplines {{are more likely to be}} offenders than others. Psychiatrists and Obstetrician-Gynecologists for example, are two disciplines noted for having a higher rate of sexual misconduct. The violation of ethical conduct between <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>patients</b> also has an association with the age and sex of doctor and patient. Male physicians aged 40–49 and 50–59 years are two groups that have been found to be more likely to have been reported for sexual misconduct, while women aged 20–39 have been found to make up a significant portion of reported victims of sexual misconduct. Doctors who enter into sexual relationships with patients face the threats of losing their medical license and prosecution. In the early 1990s, it was estimated that 2-9% of doctors had violated this rule. Sexual {{relationships between}} physicians and patients' relatives may also be prohibited in some jurisdictions, although this prohibition is highly controversial.|$|E

40|$|Background The {{purpose was}} to {{investigate}} patient-doctor agreement on clinical trial discussion cross-culturally. Methods In the International Breast Cancer Study Group Trial 33 - 03 on shared decision-making for early breast cancer in Australian/New Zealand (ANZ) and Swiss/German/Austrian (SGA) centers, <b>doctor</b> <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> characteristics plus <b>doctor</b> stress <b>and</b> burnout were assessed. Within 2 weeks post-consultation about treatment options, the <b>doctor</b> <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> reported independently, whether a trial was discussed. Odds ratios of agreement for covariables were estimated by generalized estimating equations for each language cohort, with doctor as a random effect. Results In ANZ, 21 <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> 339 <b>patients</b> were eligible; in SGA, 41 <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> 427 <b>patients.</b> In cases where the doctor indicated ‘no trial discussed', 82 % of both ANZ <b>and</b> SGA <b>patients</b> agreed; if the doctor indicated ‘trial discussed', 50 % of ANZ and 38 % of SGA patients agreed, respectively. Factors associated with higher agreement were: low tumor grade <b>and</b> fewer <b>patients</b> recruited into clinical trials in SGA; public institution, patient born in ANZ (versus other), higher <b>doctor</b> depersonalization <b>and</b> personal accomplishment in ANZ.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{cultural}} misunderstanding in care relations, starting from {{the analysis of the}} effects misunderstanding causes in the relation between <b>doctor</b> <b>and</b> migrant <b>patient.</b> The Western medical model tends to be based on objective data, which can be diagnosed through more and more precise and detailed techniques, but it excludes from care relations human and cultural aspects of subjectivity and relation.

By showing some clinical examples, this contribution points out how specialized competence can cause dark areas of obscurity, disagreement and misunderstanding, although being successful in many distressing situations.
