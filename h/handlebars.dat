5|$|In 1984, Honda {{released}} restyled {{versions of}} the Cubs on some markets, with square lamps and plastic-covered <b>handlebars</b> and rear mudguard. On the domestic Japanese market the square style was optional, but in some places such as the UK they replaced imports of the traditionally styled round lamp Cub.|$|E
5|$|Riders have experimented, however. After the Second World War many tried wooden rims of {{the sort}} used {{at the start of}} cycle racing. Francesco Moser wrapped his <b>handlebars</b> with strips of foam in the 1970s. Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle and Greg LeMond experimented with {{suspension}} in their front forks in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary control}} input that the rider can make {{is to apply}} a torque {{directly}} to the steering mechanism via the <b>handlebars.</b> Because of the bike's own dynamics, due to steering geometry and gyroscopic effects, direct position control over steering angle {{has been found to}} be problematic.|$|E
5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque {{directly to the}} <b>handlebars,</b> on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also be}} accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of the bike, called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the <b>handlebars.</b> This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables.|$|E
5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment {{generated by the}} front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the <b>handlebars</b> and so can be helpful in motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E

50|$|Stems tighten {{around and}} hold the <b>handlebar</b> either by pinch bolts, which require 'feeding' the <b>handlebar</b> through the stem after {{removing}} controls, accessories and bar covering; or via detachable faceplates, also called pillow blocks, especially on BMX bicycles, which allow a <b>handlebar</b> with controls, accessories or bar covering to be removed intact. Stems with faceplates or pillow blocks are known as pop-top stems.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{presented}} {{a study on}} the discrimination of <b>handlebar</b> grip samples, to provide effective forensic science service for hit and run traffic cases. 50 bicycle <b>handlebar</b> grip samples, 49 electric bike <b>handlebar</b> grip samples, and 96 motorcycle <b>handlebar</b> grip samples have been randomly collected by the local police in Beijing (China). Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR) was utilized as analytical technology. Then, target absorption selection, data pretreatment, and discrimination of linked samples and unlinked samples were chosen as three steps to improve the discrimination of FTIR spectrums collected from different <b>handlebar</b> grip samples. Principal component analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve were utilized to evaluate different data selection methods and different data pretreatment methods, respectively. It is possible to explore the evidential value of <b>handlebar</b> grip residue evidence through instrumental analysis and statistical treatments. It will provide a universal discrimination method for other forensic science samples as well...|$|R
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the <b>handlebars,</b> and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E
5|$|Bicycles {{have been}} constructed, for {{investigation}} and demonstration purposes, with the steering reversed so that turning the <b>handlebars</b> {{to the left}} causes the front wheel {{to turn to the}} right, and vica versa. It is possible to ride such a bicycle, but it has been found that riders experienced with normal bicycles find it very difficult to learn, if they can manage it at all.|$|E
5|$|Many riders used normal {{road race}} bikes for this stage, as {{the course is}} highly {{atypical}} for a time trial, with roads that were not flat and straight. Most of those riders altered their road race bikes with the aerodynamic <b>handlebars</b> of a time trial bike, but some, including race leader Danilo Di Luca, did not. The climbs in the stage increased the overall chances for strong climbers who are relatively weak time trialists, such as Damiano Cunego and Gilberto Simoni.|$|E

5|$|The bicycle {{made for}} Peter Van Petegem in 2004 was a Time. The {{distance}} from bottom bracket to rear axle was 419mm {{rather than his}} normal 403. The distance from the bottom bracket to the front hub was 605mm instead of 600mm. The depth of the front forks was 372mm instead of 367.5mm The forks were spaced to take 28mm tyres. The sprockets were steel rather than alloy and the steerer column was cut 5mm higher than usual to raise the <b>handlebars</b> if needed before the start.|$|E
5|$|The rider applies {{torque to}} the <b>handlebars</b> {{in order to}} turn the front wheel and so to control lean and {{maintain}} balance. At high speeds, small steering angles quickly move the ground contact points laterally; at low speeds, larger steering angles are required {{to achieve the same}} results in the same amount of time. Because of this, it is usually easier to maintain balance at high speeds. As self-stability typically occurs at speeds above a certain threshold, going faster increases the chances that a bike is contributing to its own stability.|$|E
5|$|Tiller {{effect is}} the {{expression}} {{used to describe}} how <b>handlebars</b> that extend far behind the steering axis (head tube) act like a tiller on a boat, in that one moves the bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel to the left, and vice versa. This situation is commonly found on cruiser bicycles, some recumbents, and some motorcycles. It can be troublesome when it limits the ability to steer because of interference or the limits of arm reach.|$|E
50|$|More recently, the {{contemporary}} hipster subculture has embraced the <b>handlebar</b> moustache by mocking conventional ideals of fashion, and by ironically combining a highly manicured <b>handlebar</b> moustache with {{the portrayal of}} an unkempt appearance or a haphazardly selected clothing ensemble.|$|R

5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and <b>handlebars).</b> Also involved is the yawing of the rear frame which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, <b>handlebars,</b> front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E
5|$|To learn whether errors {{actually}} {{existed in}} Lilienthal's data tables, the brothers used a bicycle {{for a new}} type of experiment. They made a model-size airfoil and a counter-acting flat plate, both according to dimensions Lilienthal had specified, and attached them to an extra bicycle wheel, which they mounted horizontally in front of the <b>handlebars.</b> Pedaling strenuously on a local street to create airflow over the apparatus, they observed that the third wheel rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining motionless as Lilienthal's formula predicted. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of lift and drag–or all of them–were in error.|$|E

5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or <b>handlebars</b> at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, <b>handlebars,</b> front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the <b>handlebars</b> {{and under the}} footpegs, {{protecting}} the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E
