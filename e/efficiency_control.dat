40|$|Local {{lifetime}} {{control and}} emitter <b>efficiency</b> <b>control</b> techniques and {{their effect on}} static and dynamic behavior of power PiN diode are investigated in this article. Mixed-mode device circuit simulations are used in order to analyze the effect of thickness and position of a reduced lifetime region and of emitter efficiency on the diode. With reference to local lifetime control the emphasis is given {{on the effect of}} the position and of the extension of the reduced lifetime region on diode performance. The low lifetime region, result of an induced damage in the epilayer, is approximated with a rectangular shape, and is defined by its thickness, position and lifetime values. The simulations show that the optimal position for the low-lifetime region is {{at the beginning of the}} base region on the anode side, while the optimal thickness of the low lifetime region depends on the amount of lifetime killing. The simulation of PiN diodes using emitter <b>efficiency</b> <b>control</b> shows that similar performance is achieved reducing anode doping or reducing anode thickness and that main limitation to their performance is reach-through phenomenon. Both local lifetime control and emitter <b>efficiency</b> <b>control</b> design techniques are shown to be effective in reducing the turn-off time and increasing diode softness with a little worsening of on-state voltage drop...|$|E

To date, the international debate has mainly focused on practices in the USA, Great Britain and France, with little evidence available of developments in other countries, such as Italy. In this paper, the authors analyse the development of cost accounting in an Italian firm, 'La Magona d'Italia'. This iron, steel and tinplate firm, situated in Piombino, is observed over the period 1865 - 1940, i. e. during the central phase of the industrial revolution in Italy. We find that several factors influenced the implementation of a cost accounting system at Magona, including <b>efficiency</b> <b>control,</b> strategic decision making, and stock valuation. We also find a strong British influence on Magona's strategy, organization and information system, particularly in respect of finance, managers, technology and accounting practices.
