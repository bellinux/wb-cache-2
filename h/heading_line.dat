Often, the <b>head</b> <b>line</b> is joined with the life line (see below) at inception. Palmists generally interpret this line to represent the person's mind and the way it works, including learning style, communication style, intellectualism, and thirst for knowledge. It is also believed to indicate a preference for creative or analytical approaches to information (i.e., right brain or left brain).|$|R
40|$|To analyze {{genetic linkage}} and map purple gene (BrPur) {{controlling}} purple inner leaves trait of Chinese cabbage, a F 2 population was constructed by selfing a F 1 plant from homozygous purple <b>heading</b> <b>line</b> ‘ 14 S 839 ’ and homozygous orange <b>heading</b> <b>line</b> ‘ 14 S 162 ’. The phenotype investigation of head color {{showed that the}} segregation ratio of purple to non-purple individuals {{was consistent with the}} expected ratio of 3 : 1, which indicated that purple inner leaves trait is controlled by a single dominant gene. A total of 297 SSRs in whole genome of Chinese cabbage were tested by modified Bulked Segregant Analysis (BSA) method. Two linked markers flanking BrPur, A 710 and A 714, were obtained and BrPur was mapped on linkage group A 07 based on the sequence of these two markers. Subsequently, two new markers flanking BrPur, CL- 12 and B 214 - 87, were developed based on two known anthocyanins-related genes, Br 4 CL 3 and Bra 004214. Genetic mapping of all markers in the F 2 mapping population showed CL- 12 and B 214 - 87 linked to BrPur with the genetic distance of 3. 1 [*]cM and 3. 5 [*]cM, respectively...|$|E

One is that the O. rufipogon segments associated with an increase in AC were not introgressed into the 96 lines and additional genetic factors for AC were not detected. For example, no O. rufipogon segment was detected on the entire chromosome 5 and some portion of the long arm of chromosome 3 due to negative selection, and other handling problems during generation advancement. Several studies reported QTLs for AC in these chromosomal regions (He et al. 1999; Tanaka et al. 2006; Edabi et al. 2013). Another is that AC was greatly influenced by the alteration of heading date and the QTL cluster on chromosome 6 represents the pleiotropic effect of the heading date QTL. A number of studies reported positive correlations between AC and the number of days to heading (Tanaka et al. 2006; Wada et al. 2006).

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the longitudinal residual strain (DRL) resulting from growth stress in standing trees, in different clones of Eucalyptus spp. Twelve clones of 9 -year-Eucalyptus spp. were selected by basal area (G). From each clone, 12 trees of each clone were selected, and the following variables were measured: basic density (DB), bark thickness (EC), diameter at breast height (DBH) and total height (H). The measurements of DRL were performed in living trees, using an extensometer(Growth Strain Gauge), according to the CIRAD-Fôret method. Readings were taken at four locations around the tree trunk. In relation to the levels of DRL, the results obtained in the study indicated that the clones showed large variations among themselves, presenting values considered high ones {{when compared with the}} results found in literature. The clone 8 was distinguished by having the lowest levels of strain and was considered as a suitable and recommended material for the production of solid wood and for breeding programs. On the other hand, the clone 1 showed the highest values of the DRL. There were variations in the DRL, along the circumference of the trunk of trees, and it was more pronounced in the East <b>heading</b> <b>line.</b> Analyzing the correlations between variables, {{it was found that the}} DRL values were significantly correlated with EC, DAP and the standing tree volume (VOL) ...|$|E

Other methods include the folding <b>head</b> <b>line</b> stop which enters the pipe through a reduced branch hot tap, the Sure-Stop line stop which intersects the pipe and doesn't seal inside the pipe like other methods, and the HTP which is a high temperature, high pressure system that will stop the flow on existing pipes at operating temperatures above what other methods of line stops can safely stop.|$|R
