5|$|Macdonald {{consistently}} {{called for}} a more equitable redistribution of wealth, so that poorer provinces such as Nova Scotia, could share fully in Canada's prosperity. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald <b>deserves</b> <b>credit</b> for the introduction, in 1957, of an equalization scheme designed to enable poorer provinces to provide comparable levels of services to their citizens. Macdonald's advocacy of provincial autonomy however, fell victim to the centralizing tendencies of a post-war welfare state in which the federal government increasingly assumed greater control over national social programs.|$|E

She <b>deserves</b> <b>credit</b> for allowing her latest interpretation of that music to be bent, folded and so lovingly mutilated by her collaborators, and when she chirps, 'I like to singy singy singy/Like a bird on a wingy wingy wingy', I can envision discos from Stockholm to Sacramento going bonkers with her.|$|E
25|$|The early {{parts of}} the European Middle Ages, {{also known as the}} Dark Ages, were marked by the decline of the Roman Empire. The Latin West was left with great {{difficulties}} that affected the continent's intellectual production dramatically. Although nature was still seen as a system that could be comprehended in the light of reason, there was little innovative scientific inquiry. The Arabic world <b>deserves</b> <b>credit</b> for preserving scientific advancements. Arabic scholars produced original scholarly work and generated copies of manuscripts from Classical periods. During this period, Christianity underwent a period of resurgence, and Western civilization was bolstered as a result. This phenomenon was, in part, due to monasteries and nunneries that nurtured the skills of reading and writing, and the monks and nuns who collected and copied important writings produced by scholars of the past..|$|E

When Jimmy tells Cartman he feels he wrote most of the joke, Cartman fears Jimmy will try to take full credit and asks Kyle for {{advice on how to}} deal with Jimmy. Kyle instead says he believes Jimmy wrote the entire joke, and suggests that Cartman's ego is so big that he subconsciously remembers things incorrectly to make himself feel more important.

500|$|There {{has been}} broad {{agreement}} among historians that McKinley's election {{was at the}} time of a transition between two political eras, dubbed the Third and Fourth Party Systems. Kenneth F. Warren emphasizes the national commitment to a pro-business, industrial, and modernizing program, represented by McKinley. Historian Daniel P. Klinghard argued that McKinley's personal control of the 1896 campaign gave him the opportunity to reshape the presidency—rather than simply follow the party platform—by representing himself as the voice of the people. Republican Karl Rove exalted McKinley as the model for a sweeping political realignment behind George W. Bush in the 2000s,—a realignment that did not happen. [...] Some political scientists, such as David Mayhew, questioned whether the 1896 election truly represented a realignment, thereby placing in issue whether McKinley <b>deserves</b> <b>credit</b> for it. Historian Michael J. Korzi argued in 2005 that while it is tempting to see McKinley as the key figure in the transition from congressional domination of government to the modern, powerful president, this change was an incremental process through the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 90 percent based on 10 reviews, {{with an average}} rating of 7.1 out of 10. A review in The Guardian praised Taran Mansukhani's direction and writing, calling it a [...] "a straight victory for gay comedy": [...] "India's convoluted attitude to gayness finally has its cinematic manifestation in Dostana, one of the gayest films ever made in any country but in which almost no one is actually gay. It's also a terrific movie – the best and funniest Bollywood film I've seen {{in a very long}} time." [...] Describing the film as a [...] "decent-hearted comedy", Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Dostana <b>deserves</b> <b>credit.</b> It irreverently normalizes a topic that has been virtually absent from screens in India, and does so using contemporary Bollywood’s best not-so-secret weapon: star power."

500|$|The A.V. Club writer Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with a B+, {{explaining}} [...] "It was the atmosphere that sold me on [...] "Northwest Passage", an episode {{with a fairly}} middling mystery and only minimal advancement of the master-plot. (Though the end-point of that advancement was a doozy, and has me eating a little crow.) At times tonight the show almost felt like a backdoor pilot for a new series, with Peter tooling around the Pacific Northwest meeting local law enforcement and cracking cases. And while that's a show I'd definitely watch, I confess I'm anxious to jump ahead to next week, when there'll be inter-dimensional conflict and doppelgangers galore". Murray considered the ending {{with the appearance of}} Walternate a [...] "strong finish to a mostly strong episode". IGN's Ramsey Isler gave it 7.8/10, writing that [...] "Fringe sophomore season is building up to an epic 2-part finale. This episode doesn't reveal much in terms of overall Fringe mythology until the very awesome ending, and even then it just confirms what we already knew or suspected. Still, this installment <b>deserves</b> <b>credit</b> for using a different formula and giving Joshua Jackson some much-deserved time in the spotlight all by himself".|$|E

[...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented on the possibly outdated dance theme. Responding to the new additions of the record including [...] "Keeps Gettin' Better", he noted: [...] "Not exactly what one would call original, but if it's true the singer's next studio album will reprise this electro-pop sound, Aguilera <b>deserves</b> <b>credit</b> for refusing to play it safe." [...] Bill Lamb from About.com awarded the track three stars. He noted Aguilera's dance-inspired effort, at a time of dance dominance in the industry, negatively and stated that [...] "the catchy electro-pop vibe isn't enough to make it one of her more memorable efforts." [...] Rolling Stone noted that in the compilation, Aguilera's old singles are [...] "weighed down by four bland attempts at 2008's trendy, Lady Gaga-jacking electropop". Paul Thompson and Amy Phillips from Pitchfork Media said that the track was [...] "basically a ripoff" [...] of Goldfrapp's [...] "Ooh La La".|$|E
50|$|Lackey is {{also known}} for arguing against the claim central to virtue {{epistemology}} that knowledge should {{be understood in terms}} of the knower’s <b>deserving</b> <b>credit</b> for the truth of her belief. Lackey argues that the virtue epistemologist faces a dilemma: either the standards for <b>deserving</b> <b>credit</b> for a true belief are relatively high, or they are relatively low. If they are relatively high, then the virtue epistemologist cannot account for instances of knowledge from testimony, where the credit for the hearer’s true belief goes to the speaker.

500|$|Monster {{established}} {{a partnership with}} rap mogul Dr. Dre and Interscope Records in 2007 to design and manufacture the Beats Electronics line of headphones called [...] "Beats by Dr. Dre". This led to a trend among headphone manufacturers to create celebrity-endorsed products. Monster created similar partnerships with Lady Gaga for the Heartbeats brand of headphones in 2009, PDiddy's Diddybeats in May 2010 and LeBron James later that year. In 2010, Monster began developing a series of products for the Chinese market that were co-branded with basketball player Yao Ming. According to analyst firm NPD Group, the Beats brand that Monster distributed exclusively grew to own 53 percent of a $1 billion headphones market. A 51 percent interest in Beats was sold to HTC in August 2011. At {{the end of the}} five-year agreement between Monster and Dr. Dre in 2012, Dre decided not to renew. According to Bloomberg, both parties said the separation was [...] "amicable" [...] but they had disagreements on who <b>deserves</b> <b>credit</b> and the share of revenues. The partnership was responsible for a substantial portion of Monster's revenues. After the split, Monster created its own headphones product line and other celebrity-branded headphones with music groups Earth, Wind & Fire and Miles Davis.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews, however, were negative. Nader Elhefnawy at Strange Horizons {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "an interesting experiment".

While he would not recommend the book to readers new to Clarke's work, Elhefnawy said that fans would not regret reading the book. Mark Yon at SFF World said that while this {{is not one of}} Clarke's best works, [...] "it is still very good".

[...] Michael Berry at the San Francisco Chronicle said that the novel does a [...] "stellar job of conveying some of the intellectual fun that can be had by manipulating math." [...] He said that Sri Lanka, Clarke's home for most of his life, is brought [...] "vividly to life", and that despite some minor flaws, The Last Theorem is a [...] "fitting valedictory for Clarke, one of science fiction's most acclaimed authors, and a reminder of Pohl's great relevance to a genre he has championed for more than 70 years." ...|$|E
500|$|Television critics reacted mostly mixed to [...] "Excellence in Broadcasting", {{calling the}} storyline [...] "funny," [...] but [...] "toothless." [...] In a {{simultaneous}} {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded the show, and the broadcast of American Dad! that followed it, The A.V. Club reviewer Rowan Kaiser noted, [...] "most of the episode was spent justifying its existence as a Rush Limbaugh episode of Family Guy," [...] and that the episode [...] "failed to do that." [...] In the conclusion of his review Kaiser praised Family Guy for its past political humor, but ultimately rated it as a D, the second worst rating, behind The Simpsons episode [...] "Loan-a Lisa" [...] and the American Dad! episode [...] "100 A.D.", beating only The Cleveland Shows F-grade episode [...] "Cleveland Live!". In a slightly more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised Limbaugh's appearance in the episode, commenting Limbaugh [...] "certainly <b>deserves</b> <b>credit</b> for his willingness to participate and lend his own voice." [...] Hughes went on to comment positively on the episode's debut of the high-definition opening sequence, and its introduction of Joyce Kinney {{as a replacement for}} news anchor Diane Simmons, who was killed off in [...] "And Then There Were Fewer."

500|$|The {{episode was}} criticized for its {{portrayal}} of people who identify as transgender, particularly regarding the way Ida was treated by other characters. Food that Ida prepared for the dinner party at the Griffin house was thrown out and Brian's learning of her sex-reassignment surgery after {{he had sex with}} her caused him to [...] "violently" [...] vomit for 30 unbroken seconds. Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane mentioned the episode in response to concerns over how his animated series have portrayed LGBT characters. [...] "It always distresses me when I hear that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side. I can safely say that the transsexual community will be very, very happy with the 'Quagmire' episode that we have coming up in a couple of months. It's probably the most sympathetic portrayal of a transexual [...] character that has ever been on television, dare I say." [...] In a subsequent review, AfterElton.com writer Brent Hartinger graded the episode negatively. While noting that the episode <b>deserves</b> <b>credit</b> for making important points about transgender people, he found its inclusion of the vomiting scene and Lois and Peter's transphobic remarks about Ida to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot." [...] The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, an LGBT media watchdog organization, released a statement about the episode, noting that [...] "GLAAD shares the serious concerns being voiced from members of the community and GLAAD’s Entertainment Media Team is addressing these with Fox. Next steps will be decided at that point." [...] In a September 2010 interview in Details, MacFarlane expressed surprise at the negative reaction, stating [...] "I don't meet a lot of stupid homosexuals." [...] He repeated that he still felt Ida was a [...] "very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and [...] "If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" [...] Eames (Digital Spy) believed the episode was [...] "surprisingly kind" [...] to the transgender community for [...] "Family Guy standards".|$|E
