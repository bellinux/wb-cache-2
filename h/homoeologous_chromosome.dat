As in autopolyploidy, this primarily occurs through the fusion of unreduced (2n) gametes, which can take place before or after hybridization. In the former case, unreduced gametes from each diploid taxa – or reduced gametes from two autotetraploid taxa – combine to form allopolyploid offspring. In the latter case, one or more diploid F1 hybrids produce unreduced gametes that fuse to form allopolyploid progeny.

However, examining chromosome pairing in the allotetraploid Brassica napus has been hampered {{by the lack of}} chromosome-specific molecular probes. In this study, we establish the identification of all <b>homoeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of allopolyploid B. napus by using robust molecular cytogenetic karyotypes developed for the progenitor species Brassica rapa (A genome) and Brassica oleracea (C genome). The identification of every chromosome among these three Brassica species utilized genetically mapped bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) from B. rapa as probes for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). With this BAC-FISH data, a second karyotype was developed using two BACs that contained repetitive DNA sequences and the ubiquitous ribosomal and pericentromere repeats. Using this diagnostic probe mix and a BAC that contained a C-genome repeat in two successive hybridizations allowed for routine identification of the corresponding <b>homoeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> between the A and C genomes of B. napus. When applied to the B. napus cultivar Stellar, we detected one chromosomal rearrangement relative to the parental karyotypes.

40|$|Abstract Background Cotton, as an {{allopolyploid}} species, contains homoeologous A and D subgenomes. The {{study of}} the homoeologous (duplicated) segments or chromosomes can facilitate insight into the evolutionary process of polyploidy {{and the development of}} genomic resources. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones as probes has commonly been used to provide a reliable cytological technique for chromosome identification. In polyploids, it also presents a useful approach for identification and localization of duplicated segments. Here, two types of BACs that contained the duplicated segments were isolated and analyzed in tetraploid cotton by FISH. Results Homologous and homoeologous BACs were isolated by way of SSR marker-based selection and then used to develop BAC-FISH probes. Duplicated segments in <b>homoeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> were detected by FISH. The FISH and related linkage map results followed known reinforced the relationships of <b>homoeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in allotetraploid cotton, and presented a useful approach for isolation of homoeologous loci or segments and for mapping of monomorphic loci.

For example, two <b>homoeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> {{that belong to}} different sub-genome of allopolyploids have similar base sequences. Thus, when conducting de novo assembly of DNA sequences, {{it is difficult to}} determine whether these sequences are derived from the same chromosome. To avoid the difficulties associated with <b>homoeologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and demonstrate the possibility of sequencing allopolyploids using single chromosomes, we conducted sequence analysis using microdissected single somatic chromosomes of cultivated strawberry. Results Three hundred and ten somatic chromosomes of the Japanese octoploid strawberry ‘Reiko’ were individually selected under a light microscope using a microdissection system. DNA from 288 of the dissected chromosomes was successfully amplified using a DNA amplification kit. Using next-generation sequencing, we decoded the base sequences of the amplified DNA segments, and on the basis of mapping, we identified DNA sequences from 144 samples that were best matched to the reference genomes of the octoploid strawberry, F.  × ananassa, and the diploid strawberry, F. vesca. The 144 samples were classified into seven pseudo-molecules of F. vesca. The coverage rates of the DNA sequences from the single chromosome onto all pseudo-molecular sequences varied from 3 to 29. 9 %.

Sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization and genomic in situ hybridization showed that an Ae. speltoides segment with Xpsr 1205 - 3 S replaced the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 3 A.

Combined transcriptomic and biochemical analyses identify target genes of GhHOX 3 that also contain the L 1 -box cis-element, including two cell wall loosening protein genes GhRDL 1 and GhEXPA 1. GhHOX 3 interacts with GhHD 1, another homeodomain protein, resulting in enhanced transcriptional activity, and with cotton DELLA, GhSLR 1, repressor of the growth hormone gibberellin (GA). GhSLR 1 interferes with the GhHOX 3 –GhHD 1 interaction and represses target gene transcription. Our results uncover a novel mechanism whereby a homeodomain protein transduces GA signal to promote fibr...|$|E
40|$|The {{chromosome}} affinity {{among the}} P genome from Agropyron and the D and H(ch) genomes of Triticum and Hordeum {{in the absence}} of the Ph system controlling <b>homoeologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairing provides information for breeding purposes. Hybrids between two accesions of the diploid barley Hordeum chilense (H(ch) H(ch)) and the fertile amphiploid Triticum tauschii-Agropyron cristatum (DDPP) were made, giving rise to the trigeneric hybrid genomic combinations H(ch) DP from which such information could be obtained. The meiotic pairing of these hybrids using fluorescence genomic in situ hybridization (FISH) on metaphase I pollen mother cells yield data on allosyndetic and autosyndetic chromosome pairing between the three genomes. The results showed that the A. cristatum tetraploid parent of the amphiploid DDPP is a segmental alloploid. A higher pairing between the D and H(ch) genomes than between them and the P genome from A. cristatum is observed.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{presence}} of closely related genomes in polyploid species makes {{the assembly of}} total genomic sequence from shotgun sequence reads produced by the current sequencing platforms exceedingly difficult, if not impossible. Genomes of polyploid species could be sequenced following the ordered-clone sequencing approach employing contigs of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and BAC-based physical maps. Although BAC contigs can currently be constructed for virtually any diploid organism with the SNaPshot high-information-content-fingerprinting (HICF) technology, it is currently unknown if this is also true for polyploid species. It is possible that BAC clones from orthologous regions of homoeologous chromosomes would share numerous restriction fragments and be therefore included into common contigs. Because of this and other concerns, physical mapping utilizing the SNaPshot HICF of BAC libraries of polyploid species has not been pursued {{and the possibility of}} doing so has not been assessed. The sole exception has been in common wheat, an allohexaploid in which it is possible to construct single-chromosome or single-chromosome-arm BAC libraries from DNA of flow-sorted chromosomes and bypass the obstacles created by polyploidy. Results The potential of the SNaPshot HICF technology for physical mapping of polyploid plants utilizing global BAC libraries was evaluated by assembling contigs of fingerprinted clones in an in silico merged BAC library composed of single-chromosome libraries of two wheat <b>homoeologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> arms, 3 AS and 3 DS, and complete chromosome 3 B. Because the chromosome arm origin of each clone was known, it was possible to estimate the fidelity of contig assembly. On average 97. 78 % or more clones, depending on the library, were from a single chromosome arm. A large portion of the remaining clones was shown to be library contamination from other chromosomes, a feature that is unavoidable during the construction of single-chromosome BAC libraries. Conclusions The negligibly low level of incorporation of clones from <b>homoeologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> arms into a contig during contig assembly suggested that it is feasible to construct contigs and physical maps using global BAC libraries of wheat and almost certainly also of other plant polyploid species with genome sizes comparable to that of wheat. Because of the high purity of the resulting assembled contigs, they can be directly used for genome sequencing. It is currently unknown but possible that equally good BAC contigs can be also constructed for polyploid species containing smaller, more gene-rich genomes. </p...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{possessing}} multiple sets {{of related}} (<b>homoeologous)</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) restricts pairing to just true homologs at meiosis. Deletion {{of a single}} major locus, Pairing homoeologous 1 (Ph 1), allows pairing of homoeologs. How can the same chromosomes be processed as homologs instead of being treated as nonhomologs? Ph 1 was recently defined to a cluster of defective cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) -like genes showing some similarity to mammalian Cdk 2. We reasoned that the cluster might suppress Cdk 2 -type activity and therefore affect replication and histone H 1 phosphorylation. Our study does indeed reveal such effects, suggesting that Cdk 2 -type phosphorylation has {{a major role in}} determining chromosome specificity during meiosis...|$|R
