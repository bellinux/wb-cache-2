25|$|It {{seemed that}} no one in the Channel Nine box could make a comment about him that wasn't negative. His feet, hands, {{technique}} and temperament were questioned. His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. It just seemed kind of mean. Especially when at the back of the press box some seemed happy when he was out. But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. He came into the captaincy without playing a game. He came into the Test team because of one-day runs. He was everything old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> much everything he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E
500|$|The disproportionate {{results of}} the trade notwithstanding, Bagwell became {{personally}} acquainted with Anderson and they formed a friendship. [...] “I knew LA and I love him,” Bagwell asserted. [...] “He used {{to make fun of}} me when I was playing bad. [...] He said, 'you’re making me look bad, you have to step it up.' [...] Look up his numbers. [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> good at what he did.” ...|$|E
60|$|Farmer Brown's Boy is {{not usually}} the forgetful kind. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> good about not forgetting. But Farmer Brown's boy isn't perfect by any means. He does forget sometimes, and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{careless}} sometimes. <b>He</b> would <b>be</b> a funny kind of boy otherwise. But take it {{day in and day}} out, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> thoughtful and careful.|$|R

500|$|The {{rough edge}} of Dylan's singing was unsettling to some but an {{attraction}} to others. Joyce Carol Oates wrote: [...] "When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, {{the effect was}} dramatic and electrifying." [...] Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers, such as Joan Baez, who became Dylan's advocate {{as well as his}} lover. Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts. [...] "It didn't take long before people got it, that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> damned special," [...] says Baez.|$|E
500|$|Hummer was a [...] back to {{the basket}} player who {{generally}} defended opposing high school centers. He had an underdeveloped face-up game yet he was undersized to play that style of game in power conferences. Power conference schools questioned how much potential he had in a league where his low post skills would likely be defended by larger, stronger and/or more athletic players who relegated him to perimeter play. When Princeton head coach Sydney Johnson recruited him, the only competition was mid-major schools and Hummer {{was not interested in}} any of them. During his campus visit with his father at his brother Alex's (Princeton Class of 2011) dorm room, he decided at midnight to go hang out at Dan Mavraides room across campus, signalling to his father that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> comfortable with Princeton and likely to attend. Due to Hummer's relationship with former Princeton and current Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball head coach John Thompson III, he was able to train at the Georgetown University gym over the summers. He also played in the Kenner League (the only National Collegiate Athletic Association–sanctioned summer league in the Washington, D.C.) during the summer.|$|E
2500|$|Crawford {{spent much}} of his later years working in his garden and reading. During the Ritter interviews, he quoted from the works of philosopher George Santayana and {{abolitionist}} Robert Ingersoll, and discussed the works of one of his favorite writers, Honoré de Balzac. As for how he hoped to be remembered, he said: [...] "When I kick off they’ll say, ‘Well, good old Sam, he wasn’t such a bad guy after all. Everything considered, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> fair and square. We’ll miss him.’" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He is a {{good deal}} of a body," [...] {{answered}} the captain. [...] "I should say <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> nearly six feet high, and of considerable bigness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Not {{old enough}} to work!” said Rollo, “Why, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> big. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> {{almost as big as}} the horse. I should think he could draw you alone in the wagon.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Kirwan's {{reaction}} was initially one of surprise, {{and it seemed}} he had little idea of how alienated from the other band members he had become, but shortly afterwards he met up with his replacement Bob Weston. Weston described the meeting: [...] "He was aware that I was taking over, and rather sarcastically wished me {{the best of luck}} – then paused and added, 'You're gonna need it.' I read between the lines that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> angry with the band." ...|$|E
2500|$|EJ {{takes an}} {{extended}} {{leave of absence}} with {{the conclusion of the}} season, ending her affair with Tony. Ziva and Ray repair their relationship somewhat, and he gives her an empty ring box as a [...] "promise" [...] before leaving for a long-term assignment. Glasberg commented, [...] "Ziva and Ray are a little open-ended at the moment. There isn't any closure to it. We'll have to see where it leads, but I think <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> clear that he has a job to do at the moment, and that's gonna be the primary focus for him." [...] The use of the ring box was criticized by viewers as an [...] "empty gesture".|$|E
2500|$|... {{what struck}} me was his intelligence. His use of angles, length and width of the crease. Also, {{guessing}} what a batsman was likely to do. And the kind of field placing that he is comfortable with. Those are the factors that struck me immediately – that this guy not only loves bowling, {{he also has a}} fair idea of what spin actually is. For somebody who started out at 18 or 19, I thought that was a big thing [...] Here is a guy who knew what the ball is supposed to do, where this guy is expected to play and what are the plans to keep that guy in check and put pressure on that guy. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> clear at 18 itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{a reward}} offered. Don't know as {{that would make}} much {{difference}} to Felix Martin, though. According to Stella's account, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> well a millionaire already." ...|$|R

2500|$|Onstage, Big Black {{presented}} an intense spectacle {{to match their}} music. Albini would set off a brick of firecrackers onstage before the band played, a tradition he carried on from their earliest performances through their dissolution and revived for their 2006 reunion set, and would count in most songs by yelling [...] "One, two, fuck you!" [...] While playing, the band members would slam their hands against their steel guitar strings so hard that they would draw blood, often needing to put adhesive bandages on their fingers. Albini used a specially-made hip-slung guitar strap worn around his waist like a belt, and would [...] "prowl the stage like a spindly gunslinger", according to Azerrad. Gerard Cosloy recalls that [...] "It looked like someone had plugged Steve into the amp [...] <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> scary to watch onstage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Week 10: Clive Davis' pick; Judge's pick (Paula Abdul); Contestant's pick - [...] "Open Arms" [...] (Journey); [...] "What You Won't Do for Love" [...] (Bobby Caldwell); [...] "I Believe to My Soul" [...] (Ray Charles, as {{performed}} by Donny Hathaway) The judges had divergent opinions about [...] "Open Arms", with Jackson {{saying he had}} problem in the chorus and he should take chances, Abdul {{said he was in}} excellent voice and did a great job, and Cowell said he was stiff and he should loosen up. Same happened with [...] "What You Won't Do for Love": Jackson said Yamin was sharp, Abdul liked it and Cowell said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> good because the style suit him although it was not the best song in the world. After [...] "I Believe To My Soul" [...] Jackson said it was not the perfect song for him but he could definitely sing and he did a good job, Abdul said nobody can sing songs like that like he did and called him a funky white boy again, and Cowell said Yamin is a great guy and a great singer and has made his mother proud, but also stated his song choices would not carry him through to the next round. Yamin was eliminated that week.|$|E
2500|$|He {{is perhaps}} underestimated as a {{musician}} and blues guitarist. His guitar work, for which he credits Tom Paley as fingerpicking teacher, is noteworthy for both syncopation and precision. It shows similarities to Mississippi John Hurt's, but Van Ronk's main influence was the Reverend Gary Davis, who conceived the guitar as [...] "a piano around his neck". Van Ronk took this pianistic approach and added a harmonic sophistication adapted from the band voicings of Jelly Roll Morton and Duke Ellington. He ranks high in bringing blues style to Greenwich Village during the 1960s, as well as introducing the folk world to the complex harmonies of Kurt Weill in his many Brecht-Weill interpretations, and {{being one of the}} very few hardcore traditional revivalists to move with the times, bringing old blues and ballads together with the new sounds of Dylan, Mitchell and Leonard Cohen. During this crucial period, he performed with the likes of Bob Dylan and spent many years teaching guitar in Greenwich Village, including to Christine Lavin, David Massengill, Terre Roche and Suzzy Roche. He influenced his protégé Danny Kalb and The Blues Project. The Japanese singer Masato Tomobe, American pop-folk singer Geoff Thais and the musician and writer Elijah Wald learned from him as well. Known for making interesting and memorable observations he once said, [...] "Painting is all about space, and music is all about time." [...] In his autobiography Bob Dylan states, [...] "I'd heard Van Ronk back in the Midwest on records and thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> great, copied some of his recordings phrase for phrase. [...] Van Ronk could howl and whisper, turn blues into ballads and ballads into blues. I loved his style. He was what the city was all about. In Greenwich Village, Van Ronk was king of the street, he reigned supreme." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He's asleep yet, wife," [...] replied Belding. [...] "Guess <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> much knocked out.... I'll {{close the}} door there so we won't wake him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A tick," [...] {{explained}} Ginger. [...] "A rotter. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> generally barred at school. Personally, I {{never had}} any use for him at all." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Foolish children!" [...] said Uncle Geoffrey, [...] "I am {{very much}} vexed with the Bee for her wilfulness about this scheme, {{but as for}} the rest, there is hardly a steadier animal than old Dumple, and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> well used to young hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd {{better come}} over to my place {{and make sure that}} it really is your cat," [...] {{suggested}} the Awkward Man, [...] "and I'll tell you all about finding him on the way. I must warn you that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> thin--but I think he'll pull through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} not my {{superior}} officer, Captain O'Grady, I should make a personal onslaught on you," [...] Ryan laughed. [...] "You will have to mind how you behave now, Terence; the brigadier is an awfully good fellow, but <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> strict in matters of discipline." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I guess <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> badly rattled." [...] Jeff stopped {{himself in}} the vague laugh of one who remembers {{something}} ludicrous, and turned his face away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Looks as if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> savage, but he's hitting up a smarter clip than I {{thought he}} could make. Guess he'll feel worse in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I should," [...] {{returned}} Quintal. [...] "As ill {{luck would}} have it, I was below at the time. They say <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> hard on Mr Christian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, it <b>is</b> not true! <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>prettier</b> than anything. You do {{not think}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> ugly. You will look at him. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> even <b>prettier</b> than when you saw him before--only he's asleep, and you can't see his eyes or his tongue, and I can't show you his hair--and it grows--isn't that wonderful? Look at him! It's true his face is very much all alike when <b>he's</b> asleep, there <b>is</b> {{not so much to}} see as when he's awake. If you kiss him very gently, he won't wake: you want to kiss him, is it not true?" ...|$|R
