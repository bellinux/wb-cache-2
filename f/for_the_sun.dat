5|$|HD 28185 {{is similar}} to our Sun in terms of mass, radius, and luminosity. The star is on the main {{sequence}} and is generating energy by fusing hydrogen in its core. The spectral type of G5V implies HD 28185 is cooler than the Sun. Like the majority of extrasolar planet host stars, HD 28185 is metal-rich relative to the Sun, containing around 173% of the solar abundance of iron. The star rotates slower than the Sun, with a period of around 30 days, compared to 25.4 days <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b>|$|E

5|$|Andrew Melville Hall in the University of St. Andrews was {{the setting}} for the Dover Recovery Centre.

Hardin-Simmons University, champions of the Border Conference, declined a Sun Bowl bid, as did the second-place team, Texas Tech. With no other option, a member of the Sun Bowl Committee—who happened to be an alumnus of Virginia Tech—suggested inviting the Hokies to play against Cincinnati, which had already accepted an invitation.|$|E
5|$|The current {{understanding}} of planetary habitability—the {{ability of a}} world to develop environmental conditions favorable {{to the emergence of}} life—favors planets that have liquid water on their surface. Most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone, which <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> extends from just beyond Venus to about the semi-major axis of Mars. During perihelion, Mars dips inside this region, but Mars's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods. The past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability. Recent evidence has suggested that any water on the Martian surface may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.|$|E

5|$|The first {{evidence}} of helium was observed on August 18, 1868, as {{a bright yellow}} line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun. The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer Norman Lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he named the D3 Fraunhofer line because it was near the known D1 and D2 lines of sodium. He concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> ἥλιος (helios).|$|E
5|$|When {{the goddess}} is at last placated, the {{retrieving}} god escorts {{her back to}} Egypt. Her return {{marks the beginning of}} the inundation and the new year. The pacified Eye deity is once more a procreative consort <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> god, or, in some versions of the story, for the god who brings her back. Mehit becomes the consort of Anhur, Tefnut is paired with Shu, and Thoth's spouse is sometimes Nehemtawy, a minor goddess associated with this pacified form of the Eye. In many cases, the Eye goddess and her consort then produce a divine child who becomes the new sun god. The goddess' transformation from hostile to peaceful is a key step in the renewal of the sun god and the kingship that he represents.|$|E

At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. The main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined. Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary formation process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.|$|E

5|$|Eclipses only {{occur in}} the eclipse season, when the Sun is close to either the {{ascending}} or descending node of the Moon. Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six lunations (synodic months), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> to travel from one node to the next. The period is {{a little less than}} half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 anomalistic months and 242 draconic months, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a saros. Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, saros cycles do not endlessly repeat. Each cycle begins with the Moon's shadow crossing the earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses the earth and the series ends. Saros cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active. The next solar eclipse will occur on February 15, 2018. It will be a partial solar eclipse visible from Antarctica and south South America.|$|E
5|$|When the helium is exhausted, the Sun {{will repeat}} the {{expansion}} it followed when the hydrogen {{in the core}} was exhausted, except that this time it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, and the Sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity {{to as much as}} 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU. According to a 2008 model, Earth's orbit is shrinking due to tidal forces (and, eventually, drag from the lower chromosphere), so that it will be engulfed by the Sun near the tip of the red giant branch phase, 1 and 3.8 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate. Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars {{at the tip of the}} asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula. By the end of that phase – lasting approximately 500,000 years – the Sun will only have about half of its current mass.|$|E
