25|$|The batch D5096–D5113 {{were all}} {{allocated}} to Gateshead depot in 1966 to replace 9F steam locos on the Tyne Dock to Consett iron ore trains. These workings used a special design of bogie <b>hopper</b> <b>wagon,</b> and these locos had an additional compressor and associated pipework. These workings, typically with loads of around 1,000 tons, were double-headed and continued until {{taken over by}} Class 37s in the 1970s, when these locos were reallocated to Scottish depots. Incidentally D5096 was, when delivered in January 1960, the first main line diesel locomotive to be built at Darlington Works.|$|E

50|$|For ballast traffic, {{the railway}} has {{a fleet of}} smooth-running bogie <b>hopper</b> <b>wagons.</b> These can be {{unloaded}} via a chute into waiting (standard gauge) trucks on the Fat Controller's Railway. The <b>hopper</b> <b>wagons</b> and unloading chute are based on similar designs once used on the Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway, who have provided much co-operation to the line.|$|R

50|$|The new railway {{line and}} double track {{projects}} {{in developing countries}} are increasing to cope the potential demand of goods transport {{as well as to}} improve line capacity. High quality <b>hopper</b> <b>wagon</b> and multi purpose track maintenance car is usually required in small lot.

50|$|From {{the late}} 1960s {{it was finally}} being {{realised}} that, in particular, manual loading and unloading of GY four-wheeled wagons was getting too expensive. In response to the issue, development of a different, extended type of <b>hopper</b> <b>wagon</b> took place, finally resulting in the GJX and, later, the GJF wagons (later recoded to VHGX/Y/F). The wagons were nearly twice as efficient as their four-wheeled cousins when comparing wagon weight to load.|$|E

50|$|Forty-four <b>hopper</b> <b>wagons</b> were {{acquired}} during {{the takeover of}} the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company in 1878, and these were identified by the Victorian Railways as O61-O104. They were scrapped by 1889, and replaced with new vehicles recycling their numbers. The Victorian Railways also constructed <b>hopper</b> <b>wagons</b> O105-O154 in 1886-1887 (including two O153's), followed by O155-O209 in 1889-1890. O23 was marked off register circa 1885, and a new O23 was built in 1890 to the new design. The second O153 was renumbered to O210 in 1891. With a handful of exceptions, the majority of this fleet was scrapped following the second world war. The older design was not suited for upgrading to automatic couplers.|$|R
50|$|In Nov 1995 she was loaned for a {{short time}} to Tunstead Quary to haul a 975-ton train of <b>hopper</b> <b>wagons,</b> she also 5 years later in Dec 2000 worked a special one off freight train along the Settle and Carlisle line from Hellifield to Ribblehead Quarry where the <b>hopper</b> <b>wagons</b> were loaded and she then worked the loaded train on from Ribblehead Quarry to Carlisle. Also in 2000, she made her first {{operational}} visit to a heritage railway, when she visited the Great Central Railway for a brief period in June of that year, as well as making a brief visit back to Stavely the following month, now the Barrow Hill Roundhouse.|$|R
