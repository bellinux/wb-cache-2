2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{conditions}} {{can be used}} to carry out these reactions, most of which are mild. [...] The Paal–Knorr Furan synthesis is normally carried out under aqueous acidic conditions with protic acids such as aqueous sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, or anhydrous conditions with a Lewis acid or dehydrating agent. [...] Common dehydrating agents include phosphorus pentoxide, anhydrides, or zinc chloride. [...] The pyrrole synthesis requires a primary amine under similar conditions, or ammonia (or ammonia precursors) can be used. [...] Synthesis of a thiophene requires a sulfurizing agent which is typically a sufficient <b>dehydrator,</b> such as phosphorus pentasulfide, Lawesson's reagent, or hydrogen sulfide.|$|E

[...] Some nightingales feed [...] on caterpillars that eat from plum trees. The guano is scraped from the cages, and an ultraviolet light {{is often used}} to kill the bacteria to sanitize it. The droppings are then usually dried with a <b>dehydrator.</b> Some are sun-dried for over two weeks while simultaneously being UV sterilized. Next, it is ground into a fine white powder, and it is sold in this form. The droppings are turned into powder in a special container that rotates for 18 hours with a ceramic ball.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was two-fold: (1) to compare {{different}} home <b>dehydrators</b> and determine if the operation and design of the home <b>dehydrators</b> affected the color, cost, nutrient content, acceptability or flavor of the resulting products and (2) to determine the effect of physical parameters on product color, nutrient content, acceptability and flavor. The physical parameters that were measured during the dehydration process were temperature, relative humidity, and mass flow rate of air. Two products, Daucus carota var sativa (carrot) and juice of Lycopersicon sp. (tomato), were dried in each of six <b>dehydrators</b> (treatments). A sensory panel was used to determine the color, acceptability and flavor differences in dehydrated carrots and tomato juice form the different treatments. Carotene and ascorbic acid content were determined in the carrots and tomato juice, respectively. The total cost of dehydration was calculated by summing the fresh produce cost, energy costs, equipment and cost of labor. The design and operation of the five <b>dehydrators</b> designated for home use had significantly different effects on the cost, color, flavor, and acceptability of both carrots and tomato juice. Ascorbic acid content in dehydrated tomato juice production from the six <b>dehydrators</b> differed significantly, but, the carotene content of dehydrated carrots did not differ statistically between treatments...|$|R
50|$|Devices require heat using {{energy sources}} such as solar or {{electric}} power or biofuel (i.e. oil), and vary in form from large-scale dehydration projects to DIY projects or commercially sold appliances for domestic use. A commercial food <b>dehydrator's</b> basic parts usually consist of a heating element, a fan, air vents allowing for air circulation and food trays to lay food upon. A <b>dehydrator's</b> heating element, fans and vents simultaneously work to remove moisture from food. A <b>dehydrator's</b> heating element warms the food causing its moisture {{to be released from}} its interior. The appliance's fan then blows the warm, moist air out of the appliance via the air vents. This process continues for hours until the food is dried to a substantially lower water content, usually less than 20%.|$|R

25|$|Most sulfurization {{agents are}} strong <b>dehydrators</b> and drive {{completion}} of the reaction. Early postulates toward the mechanism of the Paal-Knorr furan synthesis suggested that the thiophene was achieved by sulfurization of the furan product. Campaigne and Foye showed that treatment of isolated furans from the Paal-Knorr furan synthesis with phosphorus pentasulfide gave inconsistent results with the treatment of 1,4-dicarbonyls with phosphorus pentasulfide, which ruled out the sulfurization of a furan mechanism and suggests that the reaction proceeds via sulfurization of a dicarbonyl, producing a thioketone.|$|R
5000|$|Food drying is {{a method}} of food {{preservation}} in which food is dried (dehydrated or desiccated). Drying inhibits the growth of bacteria, yeasts, and mold through the removal of water. Dehydration has been used widely for this purpose since ancient times; the earliest known practice is 12,000 B.C. by inhabitants of the modern Middle East and Asia regions. Water is traditionally removed through evaporation (air drying, sun drying, smoking or wind drying), although today electric food <b>dehydrators</b> or freeze-drying {{can be used to}} speed the drying process and ensure more consistent results.|$|R

50|$|Food drying {{is a way}} to {{preserve}} fruit, vegetables, and animal proteins after harvest, that has been practiced since antiquity, and a food <b>dehydrator</b> refers to a device that removes moisture from food to aid in its preservation. A food <b>dehydrator</b> uses a heat source and air flow to reduce the water content of foods. The water content of food is usually very high, typically 80% to 95% for various fruits and vegetables and 50% to 75% for various meats. Removing moisture from food restrains various bacteria from growing and spoiling food. Further, removing moisture from food dramatically reduces the weight of the food. Thus, food dehydrators are used {{to preserve}} and extend the shelf life of various foods.|$|E

40|$|There are {{approximately}} 36, 000 glycol dehydration {{systems in the}} natural gas production sector emitting an estimated 15 Bcf of methane per year into the atmosphere. Most dehydration systems use triethylene glycol (TEG) as the absorbent fluid to remove water from natural gas. As TEG absorbs water, it also absorbs methane, other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). As TEG is regenerated through heating in a reboiler, absorbed methane, VOCs, and HAPs are vented to the atmosphere with the water, wasting gas and money. The amount of methane absorbed and vented is directly proportional to the TEG circulation rate. Many wells produce gas far below the original design capacity but continue to circulate TEG at rates {{two or three times}} higher than necessary, resulting in little improvement in gas moisture quality but much higher methane emissions and fuel use. Reducing circulation rates reduces methane emissions at negligible cost. Installing flash tank separators on glycol <b>dehydrators</b> further reduces methane, VOC, and HAP emissions and saves even more money. Recovered gas can be recycled to the compressor suction and/or used as a fuel for the TEG reboiler and compressor engine. Economic analyses show flash tank separators installed on dehydration units payback costs in 4 to 11 months. Technology Background Many producers use triethylene glycol (TEG) in <b>dehydrators</b> to remove water from the natural gas stream and to meet pipeline quality standards. In a typical TEG system, shown in Exhibit 1, “lean ” (dry) TEG is pumped to the gas contactor. In the contactor, the TEG absorbs water, methane, VOCs, and HAPs (including benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes (BTEX)), from the wet production gas. The “rich ” (wet) TEG leaves the contactor saturated with gas a...|$|R

Experimental research has been carried out, whereby the moisture reduction of vacuum-dried blueberry fruits was measured by applying the capacitive measuring method, in order to check the method and contribute to possible development of applicative devices. A real vacuum chamber with radiating plate electric heaters and additional functional and regulation equipment was used. Measuring sensors were projected and made, and a measuring device was assembled and programmed. By changing very low values of capacitance, the possibility of measuring moisture reduction in blueberry fruits during drying was confirmed. A close connection between the regulation precision of working parameters (subpressure, temperature) in the chamber and the accuracy of measuring the material moisture was underlined. By using an interdigital sensor acceptable sensitivity in measuring the moisture of dried material was achieved. Guidelines for further research and possible development of an applicable measuring device were suggested...|$|R
40|$|On the {{marginal}} {{lands of the}} Great Plains, where rainfall is unfavorable to crop agriculture, urban settlements are more scattered and rural-farm settlement is usually more dispersed than in the more humid eastern border of the plains. Some crop agriculture with high returns per acre can be practiced in these marginal lands when supplemental water is added. Supplemental water is supplied to farms in the Great Plains region through large, federally sponsored irrigation districts, or through smaller privately operated districts. This thesis is the record of a study of settlement in the Pathfinder District, a federally sponsored irrigation district, in the North Platte Valley. Some {{of the results of}} this investigation are: 1) The introduction of irrigation marked the beginning of present settlement conditions. Supplemental water had {{to be added to the}} natural supply available to crops in order to attain the production required to maintain a permanent population in the area. 2) Irrigated crops require a greater degree of mechanization. There are increased labor requirements due to high returns per acre of irrigated crops. 3) Present crops could support additional urban and rural-farm population if additional collection and processing industries were established in the area, such as canning factories, and alfalfa <b>dehydrators.</b> Advisor:Earl E.
