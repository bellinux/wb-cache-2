5|$|Nick calls Norah, {{apologizing for}} leaving, and she agrees {{to meet him}} again. Deciding to go somewhere where no one they <b>know</b> <b>will</b> find them, they arrive at Electric Lady Studios, a music studio owned by Norah's father. Once there, Norah gets Nick to play {{something}} {{he wrote in the}} studio, but then joins him in the recording room. Norah gets a text message from Caroline telling her where she found Where's Fluffy? playing. When they arrive at the show, they meet Tris, who cannot understand why Nick will not take her back, and Tal, who wants the same answer from Norah. Tal starts a fight with Nick, but Thom and Dev's friend, Lethario (Jonathan B. Wright), steps in and headbutts Tal. Nick and Norah share a smile and leave together. At Pennsylvania Station, Nick admits that he does not care about missing the concert, and they kiss on the escalator as the sun rises over New York City.|$|E

He is co-author, along with Mary Bennett, of Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers and co-producer of What Happened On the Moon? He is the main proponent of the 'whistle-blower' accusation, arguing that mistakes in the NASA photos are so obvious that they are evidence that insiders are trying to 'blow the whistle' on the hoax by knowingly adding mistakes that they <b>know</b> <b>will</b> be seen. Most of his allegations of photographic anomalies have been refuted by Doug Millard of the Science Museum in London.|$|E

25|$|A {{recurring}} theme {{is that the}} actions of the group may hasten the cataclysm they are trying to avoid, or alter history in undesirable ways. A character who was supposed to live until 2007 dies in the first episode after helping the group. In one episode, Sarah and Angela protect a girl they <b>know</b> <b>will</b> be kidnapped. Although this prevents that individual's kidnapping, the kidnapper takes a different child. Kurt makes a large bet on a football game whose outcome is already known to him, but the pressure of knowing has a negative effect on a player instrumental in winning the game, and the team loses.|$|E
500|$|During the two Zaca expeditions Beebe was {{accompanied}} by his longtime assistant John Tee-Van as well as Jocelyn Crane, a young carcinologist who had first worked for Beebe at Nonsuch Island in 1932, and who would subsequently be among Beebe's most cherished associates {{for the rest of}} his life. Like Hollister before her, Crane would eventually become Beebe's lover during the long expeditions that Beebe made without Elswyth's companionship. During this time Beebe was also forming a close friendship with Winnie-the-Pooh's creator A. A. Milne, who wrote of Half Mile Down [...] "I don't know which I envy you most: all those moral and physical qualities which you have and I lack, or all that wonder of a new world. [...] One of the few things in the world of which I am really proud is that I <b>know</b> <b>Will</b> Beebe." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{month after}} the plan took effect, the Canadian {{government}} announced that the country's sex industry {{would no longer be}} allowed to employ foreign workers because of the risks of exploitation, abuse, and trafficking in that environment. As part of this policy, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada stopped issuing new temporary work permits for foreigners seeking work with escort agencies, massage parlours, and strip clubs. Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, said that he hoped that the NAP-CHT would be strengthened by this new policy, and said that its purpose was to protect foreigners [...] "from what they might not <b>know</b> <b>will</b> happen to them when they get to Canada." [...] That November, Status of Women Canada sought to support the NAP-CHT by soliciting the public for proposals of how to best support community organizations that serve female victims of sex traffickingthe most common victims of this form of trafficking. In late 2012, Smith launched the Joy Smith Foundation as a follow-up to the NAP-CHT; this nonpartisan, apolitical foundation is dedicated to raising awareness about human trafficking and providing support to human trafficking victims with counselling, housing, and clothing.|$|E

500|$|Other aspects {{grew out}} of basic {{concepts}} or ideas. For the episode [...] "Skin", writer Shiban felt that the shapeshifting villain had to change {{into one of the}} lead characters. The character chosen was Dean, and the writers decided not to clear his name of attempted murder {{at the end of the}} episode. Though they at first feared that having one of the main characters be a wanted man would later ruin the show, the writers eventually felt it was [...] "a great layer to add", opening up new potential storylines and characters. Dean's reputation is addressed again in [...] "The Benders", and catches up to him in the second and third seasons. Another element that would influence future episodes came about in [...] "Hook Man" [...] when writers Milbauer and Burton realized that shotguns shoot salt, a weakness for spirits. Kripke deemed it the [...] "perfect combination of occult element", as it brought together a [...] "folkloric repellent of evil" [...] with the [...] "blue-collar aspect of shotguns". The episode [...] "Asylum" [...] later established iron as another weapon against ghosts. [...] "Faith", on the other hand, stemmed from the question of whether it truly was wrong to heal good people of their illnesses at the cost of the lives of strangers. Kripke noted, [...] " [...] really a great girl and she deserves to live, and some stranger you don't even <b>know</b> <b>will</b> die... and maybe that's worth it." [...] Reapers were not in the original script of the episode, but were added later to give the writers a chance to create [...] "scary" [...] sequences and to explain the faith healer's ability. Because the writers found the traditional look of the Reaper—hooded and carrying a sickle—to be cheesy, they ultimately made him appear as [...] "the most shriveled old man you could ever imagine".|$|E

However, Vermont prohibits only [...] "open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior", meaning that conventional streaking is entirely legal. This difference in legality complicates streaking events such as the Ledyard Challenge, which has components in both states.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{consider}} what difference knowledge of outcomes - both {{past and future}} - might make to the rationality of praying for them on a traditional theistic model. More specifically, I address four questions: Could it be rational to pray for outcomes one <b>knows</b> <b>will</b> obtain? Could it be rational to pray for outcomes one <b>knows</b> <b>will</b> not obtain? Could it be rational to pray for outcomes one knows have obtained? I argue that on certain common theistic assumptions, {{the answer to all}} of these questions is yes. Citation: Mawson, T. J. (2007). 'Praying for known outcomes', Religious Studies, 43 (1), 71 - 87.

I am prepared with an answer that I <b>know</b> <b>will</b> seem daring to you. I believe that...primal fantasies, and no doubt a few others as well, are a phylogenetic endowment". His suggestion that primal fantasies are a residue of specific memories of prehistoric experiences have been construed as being aligned with the idea of archetypes. Laplanehe and Pontalis point out that all the so-called primal fantasies relate to the origins and that [...] "like collective myths they claim to provide a representation of and a 'solution' to whatever constitutes an enigma for the child".|$|E
2500|$|In November 2003, at the {{suggestion}} of Victor Gao, the Winklevosses and Narendra approached Mark Zuckerberg about joining the HarvardConnection team. The previous HarvardConnection programmers had reportedly made progress on coding front-end pages, the registration system, a database, back-end coding, and a way users could connect with each other, which Gao called a [...] "handshake". In early November, Narendra emailed Zuckerberg saying, “We’re very deep into developing a site which we would like you {{to be a part of}} and ... which we <b>know</b> <b>will</b> make some waves on campus.” Within days, Zuckerberg was talking to the HarvardConnection team and preparing to take over programming duties from Gao. On the evening of November 25, 2003, the Winklevosses and Narendra met with Zuckerberg in the dining hall of Harvard's Kirkland House, where they explained to Zuckerberg the HarvardConnection website, the plan to expand to other schools after launch, the confidential nature of the project, and the importance of getting there first. During the meeting, Zuckerberg allegedly entered into an oral contract with Narendra and the Winklevosses and became a partner in HarvardConnection.
