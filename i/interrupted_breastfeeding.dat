40|$|An {{increasing}} number of women are diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy and lactation. Women are usually advised to <b>interrupt</b> <b>breastfeeding</b> during systemic anticancer treatment for fear of serious adverse effects to the nursed infant. However, the issue is poorly addressed in the literature and very few studies have evaluated the safety of breastfeeding during or after cytotoxic drugs or target agents administration. In this review we will analyze the available evidence that addresses the issue of anticancer drugs, targeted agents, antiemetics and growth-factors excretion in human milk.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{prospective}} {{study was to investigate}} the relationship between body image perception and breastfeeding in puerperae with postpartum depression symptoms. The participants (147 healthy puerperae) completed The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Body Uneasiness Test (BUT-A and BUT-B), investigating body image perception and specific worries about particular body parts or functions. One month after discharge, new mothers participated in telephone interview concerning postpartum lactation practices. The subset of puerperae with EPDS score 49 also participated in psychological EPDS and BUT 6 -month follow up. Mothers with EPDS score 49 (28 / 147, 19. 04 %) had significantly higher scores on BUT-A Global Severity Index (0. 69 ± 0. 64 versus 0. 37 ± 0. 31, p 50. 0001) and on BUT-B Positive Symptom Distress Index (0. 74 ± 0. 57 versus 0. 41 ± 0. 42, p 50004). In addition, the mothers with symptoms of depression were more likely (1 : 2) to <b>interrupt</b> full <b>breastfeeding</b> in the first month postpartum. At the 6 -month follow up, the subset of new mothers with depression symptoms maintained elevated BUT-A and BUT-B scores, while EPDS 49 persisted in one-third of these.

40|$|Despite the {{well-known}} nutritive, psychological, immunological and economical benefits of breast-feeding, some contraindications exist, such as some mother infectious diseases transmitted through the breastfeeding itself. The risk of transmitting an infectious agent through breast milk {{seems to be}} relatively low, except for some virus diseases (CMV HIV), for some invasive bacteria forms (Salmonella typhimurium and Brucella) and {{for the presence of}} abscesses and mastitis. In some mother infectious disease, a correct hygiene allows the continuation of breastfeeding without risks for the infant, whereas in other cases it is recommended to breastfeed for the role of defence carried out from specific antibodies contained in the breast milk.

50|$|The {{rationale}} for NOT restricting dietary galactose exposure of infants and/or {{young children with}} DG: Healthcare providers who do not recommend dietary restriction of galactose for infants with DG generally consider DG to be of no clinical significance—meaning most infants and children with DG {{seem to be doing}} clinically well. Further, these providers may be opposed to <b>interrupting</b> or reducing <b>breastfeeding</b> when there is no clear evidence it is contraindicated. These providers may argue that the recognized health benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the potential risks of as yet unknown negative effects of continued milk exposure for these infants. For infants with DG who continue to drink milk, some doctors would recommend that blood galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1P) or urinary galactitol be rechecked by age 12 months to ensure that these metabolite levels are normalizing.|$|R

O objetivo desta Dissertação foi descrever uma série histórica de duração mediana do aleitamento materno entre as décadas de 1960 e 2000, identificando os fatores associados ao risco de interrupção do aleitamento materno em cada década. Foram utilizados os dados do Estudo Pró-Saúde (EPS), investigação epidemiológica {{longitudinal}} iniciada em 1999 com uma população de trabalhadores técnico-administrativos de uma universidade localizada no Estado do Rio de Janeiro. As informações de duração do aleitamento materno relativas ao primeiro filho foram coletadas em duas fases do EPS: fase 1 (1999, n = 4030), e fase 4 (2011 - 2012, n = 2933). As mulheres que participaram da fase 4 e que já haviam participado da fase 1 foram consideradas somente uma vez. Assim, o total de participantes deste estudo foi de 2160 mulheres, das quais 1747 tiveram pelo menos um filho, sendo que 1727 relataram ter amamentado e destas, 1539 informaram a duração do aleitamento materno do primeiro filho. A análise da duração da amamentação foi realizada utilizando procedimentos de análise de sobrevivência e o efeito das co-variáveis sobre o tempo de aleitamento foi avaliado por meio do modelo de regressão de Cox. O nível de significância testado foi de 5 % e para a análise estatística o software utilizado foi o programa Stata 12. 0. Os resultados da dissertação são apresentados no artigo intitulado Série histórica da duração do aleitamento materno entre as décadas de 1960 a 2000, Estudo Pró-Saúde. Foi constatado que a duração mediana do aleitamento materno foi menor na década de 1970 e maior na década de 1980 em diante (6, 5, 6, 8 e 12 meses no decorrer das décadas de 1960 a 2000 respectivamente). Na década de 1970 os fatores estatisticamente associados a menor duração do aleitamento materno foram a idade materna (risco mais elevado entre mães mais velhas), e renda familiar (risco mais elevado entre famílias com maior renda). Já, na década de 2000, as mulheres com renda familiar intermediária amamentaram por mais tempo. As mulheres que se declararam da cor preta amamentaram por mais tempo quando comparadas às de cor branca nas décadas de 1960 e 1970, e quando comparadas às de cor branca e parda na década de 1980. Concluiu-se que a duração mediana do aleitamento materno diminuiu na década de 1970, aumentando nas décadas seguintes, o que coincide com a adoção de políticas, normas e práticas em favor da promoção, proteção e apoio ao aleitamento materno a partir da década de 1980. In Brazil, {{information about}} the practice and duration of breastfeeding before the year 1986 is little known {{by the lack of}} studies at that time. The purpose of this dissertation was to describe a historical series of median duration of breastfeeding between the 1960 s and 2000, while identifying factors associated with the risk of <b>interrupting</b> <b>breastfeeding</b> in each decade. Information of the Pró-Saúde Study (EPS) Longitudinal epidemiological investigation started in 1999 with a population of technical and administrative employees from a university in the state of Rio de Janeiro was used. The {{information about the}} duration of breastfeeding regarding the first child were collected in two phases of the EPS: Phase 1 (1999, n = 4030), and phase 4 (2011 - 2012, n = 2933). Women who participated in the Phase 4 and had already participated in Phase 1 were considered only once. The total number of participants of this study was 2160 women, of whom 1747 had at least one child, and in 1727 reported having breastfed and these, 1539 informed the duration of breastfeeding the first child. Breastfeeding duration was analyzed using survival analysis procedures and the effect of covariates on the breastfeeding duration was assessed by Cox regression model. The tested significance level was 5 % and for the analysis statistical was used the Stata 12. 0 software. The dissertation results are presented in the article entitled "Historical series of duration of breastfeeding between the decades from 1960 to 2000, Pró-Saúde Study". It was found that the median duration of breastfeeding was lower in the 1970 s and increased in the 1980 s onwards (6, 5, 6, 8 and 12 months over the decades from 1960 to 2000 respectively). In the 1970 s the factors statistically associated with shorter duration of breastfeeding were maternal age (higher risk among older mothers), and family income (higher risk among families with higher income). In the 2000 s, women with intermediate family income breastfed for longer. Women who reported themselves as black people breastfed for longer when compared to white women in the 1960 s and 1970 s, and when compared to white and brown color in the 1980 s. The conclusion is that the median duration of breastfeeding had decreased in the 1970 s, but increasing in the following decades, which coinciding with the adoption of policies, standards and practices for the promotion, protection and support of breastfeeding from the 1980 s...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{prevalence}} of early cessation of exclusive breastfeeding in Australia, with early cessation defined as the point when an infant fed exclusively on breast milk is first fed infant formula or other foods/fluids before the first 6 months of age. The thesis identifies key factors associated with low rates of exclusive breastfeeding, and explores both how mothers experience breastfeeding and the cessation of exclusive breastfeeding. The research used a mixed methods approach that combined secondary analysis of questionnaire data with qualitative focus group (FG) data. A nationally-representative sample of 22, 202 breastfeeding mothers and infant pairs {{was derived from the}} 2010 Australian National Infant Feeding Cross-Sectional Survey. This sample was analysed using survival analysis (stratified Cox proportional hazard model) to identify prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding and factors associated with cessation of exclusive breastfeeding within the first 6 months. Data from 22 FGs, involving 108 Tasmanian mother-child pairs was used to explore mothers’ experiences of breastfeeding and cessation of exclusive breastfeeding. Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of practice provided a theoretically derived framework for the qualitative analysis. This research revealed that few infants aged less than 6 months, are exclusively breastfed. Half of the national questionnaire sample had ceased exclusive breastfeeding before the first two months. Multiple factors were associated with interrupting exclusivity, with the mothers’ partners’ preference for bottle-feeding, or having no preference most strongly associated with cessation. The final Cox regression adjusted multivariate model showed that mothers with education levels below bachelor degree, who smoked cigarettes, were obese and or overweight, diagnosed with perinatal depression, had fed their infants expressed milk and used a dummy regularly, and whose infants had not received skin to skin at birth, were independently associated with an increased hazard ratio of <b>interrupting</b> exclusive <b>breastfeeding.</b> Analysis of FG data found that the preference, to breastfeed appears to be integral to the maternal habitus in Australia. Mothers in the FG study understood breastfeeding as feeding from the breast, and valued this form of feeding above all other milks and methods because it is viewed as natural. However, the concept of “exclusive breastfeeding” had little relevance for them. Despite the value given to breastfeeding, many women struggle to convert their embodied physical capital (breasts, milk, nipples) to feed their children. Mothers described deploying non-maternal capital such as fathers and dummies as “allofeeding” methods to support breastfeeding. Despite this support, early cessation of exclusive breastfeeding through the use of infant formula is common. A disjuncture thus occurs between practice, what mothers do (use formula) and the maternal habitus, (to breastfeed). As a result, many mothers are unable to “make sense” of their use of formula resulting in powerful feelings of personal and social failure and breastfeeding grief. This research contributes to public health and sociological understandings of early cessation of exclusive breastfeeding. It identifies factors that are associated with cessation of exclusive breastfeeding, offers insights into how women perceive and experience exclusive breastfeeding and describes what it is like for breastfeeding mothers to cease exclusive breastfeeding through the use of infant formula. Given that interactions between multiple factors are associated with early cessation of exclusive breastfeeding the development of strategies to support exclusive breastfeeding is likely to be challenging. Greater recognition {{of the value of the}} allofeeding support provided by fathers (or other partners) and engaging and supporting more fathers to be collaborative breastfeeding partners may be an effective strategy. Reframing breastfeeding as a cooperative practice may also help alleviate that guilt and shame many women experience as a result of disjuncture...|$|R
