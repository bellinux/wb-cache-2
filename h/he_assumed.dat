25|$|Davidson {{argued that}} {{anomalous}} monism follows from three plausible theses. Firstly, <b>he</b> <b>assumes</b> {{the denial of}} epiphenomenalism, the denial of the view that mental events do not cause physical events. Secondly, <b>he</b> <b>assumes</b> a nomological view of causation, according to which one event causes another if (and only if) there is a strict, exceptionless law governing {{the relation between the}} events. Thirdly, <b>he</b> <b>assumes</b> the principle of the anomalism of the mental, according to which there are no strict laws that govern the relationship between mental event types and physical event types. By these the theses, Davidson argued, it follows that the causal relations between the mental and the physical hold only between mental event tokens, but mental events as types are anomalous. That ultimately secures token physicalism and a supervenience relation between the mental and the physical, while respecting the autonomy of the mental (Malpas, 2005, §2).|$|R
