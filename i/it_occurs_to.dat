5|$|Numerous {{case studies}} of brain damage have shown that damage to {{areas of the brain}} (such as the {{anterior}} prefrontal cortex) results in the reduction or elimination of inhibitions, with a corresponding radical change in behaviour. When the damage occurs to adults, they may still be able to perform moral reasoning; but when <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> children, they may never develop that ability.|$|E
5|$|The {{flashback}} jumps {{forward to}} April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). A {{piece of work}} on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from {{going out on a}} Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. <b>It</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number {{on the side of a}} dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.|$|E
500|$|In the Russian Imperial Palace, while Tsar Paul I sleeps, a dalliance {{between two}} courtiers {{ends with a}} shriek which wakens the tsar. Enraged, he demands that his {{officials}} produce the culprit or face banishment for life. Meanwhile, a clerk's {{slip of the pen}} while compiling a military duty roster results in the inclusion in the list of a fictitious officer, [...] "Lieutenant Kijé". When the tsar inspects the list he is intrigued by this name, and asks that the officer be presented to him. The court officials are too terrified of the tsar to admit that a mistake has been made, and are in a dilemma until <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> them to blame [...] "Kijé" [...] for the nocturnal disturbance. They inform the tsar, who duly orders the imaginary lieutenant flogged and sent to Siberia.|$|E

500|$|Ratings-wise, several episodes have surpassed {{one million}} views {{according}} to Nielsen Media Research. Hughes {{added that he}} follows the series' ratings when <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> him, but does not receive further analytics. He found it to trend on Twitter during the weeks of its airing, and likes viewing user's statuses regarding it. In particular, he enjoys reactions from people who wake up to it after falling asleep to the network, and judged from the online response that its audience would be [...] "pretty young, late teens, early 20s" [...] and [...] "strangely positive and engaged." [...] The network has broadcast praise of the show written by viewers {{in the form of}} bumpers, often hinting at further episodes being produced. Episodes have been distributed to sites like YouTube, while a continuous online stream of the show was launched by the network on September 5, 2014. On December 19, 2014, the show's Facebook page announced that additional exclusive material will be added to the livestream.|$|E
500|$|The metaphysical {{conflicts}} {{born from}} man's isolation {{are also important}} themes throughout the story, as the characters cannot rely on a higher cause or being for protection. The correspondent laments the lack of religious support, {{as well as his}} inability to blame God for his misfortunes, musing: [...] "When <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> a man that nature does not regard him as important, and that she feels she would not maim the universe by disposing of him, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, and he hates deeply that there are no bricks and no temples." [...] Man's perception of himself and the world around him are also constantly questioned; the correspondent regularly refers to the way things [...] "seemed" [...] or [...] "appeared", leaving how a thing actually [...] "was" [...] entirely ambiguous. Wolford similarly pointed to the importance of the story's strong yet problematic opening line—"None of them knew the color of the sky"—as one that sets the scene for the story's sense of unease and uncertainty.|$|E
500|$|Woodroof bribes a {{hospital}} worker {{to get him}} the AZT. As soon as he begins taking it, he finds his health deteriorating (exacerbated by his cocaine use). When {{he returns to the}} hospital, he meets Rayon (Jared Leto), a drug addicted, HIV-positive trans woman, toward whom he is hostile. As his health worsens, he drives to a Mexican hospital to get more AZT. Dr. Vass, who has had his American medical license revoked, tells him that the AZT is [...] "poisonous" [...] and [...] "kills every cell it comes into contact with". He instead prescribes ddC and the protein peptide T, which are not approved in the US. Three months later, Woodroof finds his health much improved. <b>It</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> him that he could make money by importing the drugs and selling them to other HIV-positive patients. Since the drugs are not illegal, he is able to get them over the border by masquerading as a priest and swearing that they are for personal use. Meanwhile, Dr. Saks also begins to notice the negative effects of AZT, but is told by her supervisor Dr. Sevard that it cannot be discontinued.|$|E

2500|$|Sister Pascalina later {{recalled}} that the Nuncio was heartbroken that the Kaiser turned [...] "deaf ear {{to all his}} proposals". She later wrote, [...] "Thinking back today on that time, when we Germans still all believed that our weapons would be victorious and the Nuncio was deeply sorry that the chance had been missed to save what there was to save, <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> me {{over and over again}} how clearly he foresaw what was to come. Once as he traced the course of the Rhine with his finger on a map, he said sadly, 'No doubt this will be lost as well.' I did not want to believe it, but here, too, he was to be proved right." ...|$|E
2500|$|The khanum, {{referred}} to as the Sultana or [...] "the little sultana," [...] in Leroux's book, is widely regarded as the most powerful woman in Persia. The khanum is a frightful woman. Drunk with the power that she has over her son, and therefore over Persia, she indulges in fetishes of every kind, normally involving some modicum of pain or humiliation. She is described as a woman of [...] "intense and urgent passions," [...] who finds a pleasure in death so powerful that it borders on sexual. Intrigued by Erik's macabre appearance and dexterity at murder, the khanum develops a great lust for him early on, and this she harbors spitefully, never quite daring to exercise her power in this particular area. Erik never learns of her infatuation with him, though <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> him in passing, but he puts it down to arrogance.|$|E
2500|$|Conical {{micrometer}} anvils, specifically {{suited to}} {{resting on the}} sides of the thread, are made for various thread angles, with 60° being the most common. Mics with such anvils are usually called [...] "thread mics" [...] or [...] "pitch mics" [...] (because they directly measure the pitch diameter). Users who lack thread mics rely instead on the [...] "3-wire method", which involves placing 3 short pieces of wire (or gauge pins) of known diameter into the valleys of the thread and then measuring from wire to wire with standard (flat) anvils. A conversion factor (produced by a straightforward trigonometric calculation) is then multiplied with the measured value to infer a measurement of the thread's pitch diameter. Tables of these conversion factors were established many decades ago for all standard thread sizes, so today a user need only take the measurement and then perform the table lookup (as opposed to recalculating each time). The 3-wire method is also used when high precision is needed to inspect a specific diameter, commonly the pitch diameter, or on specialty threads such as multi-start or when the thread angle is not 60°. [...] Ball-shaped micrometer anvils can be used in similar fashion (same trigonometric relationship, less cumbersome to use). Digital calipers and micrometers can send each measurement (data point) as <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> storage or software through an interface (such as USB or RS-232), in which case the table lookup is done in an automated way, and quality assurance and quality control can be achieved using statistical process control.|$|E
