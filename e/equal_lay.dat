In this essay they are subjected to a constructive critique. Three shibboleths of place are identified and scrutinised. Taking the writings of Michael Watts, Doreen Massey and David Harvey as a focus, {{it is argued that}} these shibboleths possess important but nonetheless limited value as explanatory and normative tools. Working within the broad parameters of a relational worldview, the essay proposes a more nuanced approach to place than that offered by Watts, Massey and Harvey.

This recently proposed learning theory in education research can be useful for laying the conceptual foundation among students as well as the first-time learners of a discipline. This study identifies three key concepts as the threshold concepts and links them with other concepts of the relatively new and technology-oriented discipline of Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The user-friendly technology, both in the form of software and hardware, dominates the GIS, and this overly leads to the use of these tools without conceptual understanding.

40|$|Sometime in 359 Julian the Apostate, who {{was going}} to be sole Roman Emperor from 361 to 363, but was then still "Caesar" in Gaul under Constantius II., wrote a {{consolation}} to himself on the departure of his close friend and advisor Salutius, who had been his "quaestor sacri palatii" or minister of justice since 355, but had (apparently suddenly and unexpectedly) been called back to Constantinople by the Emperor Constantius II. The work displays some typical features of an ancient consolation. Julian expresses his grief over Salutius's departure but also touches upon more general topics such as the nature of friendship, grieving, death and the nature of God. The present chapter asks in what sense Julian's work can be seen as a "typical" "consolation" in the context of the ancient consolatory genre as a whole. It also touches upon prosopographical questions regarding the addressee, explores the question of possible sources (including, for example, Cicero, who also wrote a consolation to himself and whose work "Laelius", "On Friendship", shares topics with Julian's work), and, finally, throws a brief glance on Julian's theological inclination. It concludes that while a theological interest is palpable in Julian's writing, it is difficult to identify in it any bias (e. g. pro- or anti-Christian), given the Classicizing nature of the work. Rather, what can be said is that the "consolation" can <b>lay</b> <b>equal</b> claim to being a work of rhetoric and of philosophy, a key text for understanding Julian's early career, and important for understanding the intellectual culture of the fourth century CE...|$|R
40|$|Beginning with a {{discussion}} of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, this article discusses the meaning of “integration. ” In McLaurin, the University of Oklahoma was forced to abandon its segregation policy and not separate black students from their white classmates in all settings (not just the classroom). The McLaurin decision raised the fundamental questions: 2 ̆ 2 What is integration? 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 How is integration related to racial equality? 2 ̆ 2 Significantly, the McLaurin Court clarifies that equality is premised on integration and that integration means more than just having a presence in an institution. The case highlights the complexities of the concept of integration even though the concept on its face seems rather simple. Thus, McLaurin is an invitation to explore the relationship between equality and integration. Equality is achieved when people of color and whites <b>lay</b> <b>equal</b> claim to a shared environment or institution, including shaping institutional policy. This article focuses on racial segregation on law reviews, a persistent problem with respect to black students at many law schools. Law review as an institution enjoys enormous significance in allocating power among students, and membership on law review can have a significant and enduring positive effect on a person 2 ̆ 7 s career. Law review opens up career possibilities that generally are foreclosed to students who do not join the review. As long as law reviews remain racially segregated, racial equality in law schools remains elusive because students of color are cut-off from significant career opportunities. Perhaps this exploration will lead to ideas about how law school communities can become more integrated in ways that move beyond the simplest understanding of integration based on numbers and move us into the sophisticated McLaurin definition of integration based on racial equality...|$|R

40|$|The general {{objective}} of my {{study was to}} monitor proximate causes and seasonal patterns of hatching asynchrony and chick survival in the Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis). Two different plots were set up at a Ring-billed Gull colony near Port Colborne, Ontario {{in the summer of}} 1992. One group was from 'peak' nesting pairs (clutches initiated between 15 April and 1 May); a second group was from 'late' nesting pairs (clutches initiated between 9 [...] 22 May). Despite <b>equal</b> intra-clutch egg <b>laying</b> intervals between the peak and late periods, intra-clutch hatching intervals lengthened as the season progressed (ie. hatching became more asynchronous). Clutches from both periods were monitored for nocturnal attendance and brood patch development of parents was monitored during the egg laying period. Late nesters were characterized by an absence of nocturnal desertion, substantial brood patch defeatheration at clutch initiation and a {{reduction in the number of}} chicks fledged per pair. Chick survival to 25 days (taken as fledging) reflected patterns of chick mass at brood completion and five days post-brood completion, in peak clutches. In late clutches, survival was poor for all chicks and, was partially independent of hatching order, due in part to stochastic events such as Herring Gull predation and adverse weather. In both the peak and late periods, last-hatched C-chicks realized the poorest survival to fledging among brood mates. An artificial hatching pattern (manipulated synchrony) and an artificial hatching order were created, in three-chick broods, through a series of egg exchanges. In peak and late clutches manipulated to hatch synchronously (s; 24 h) : C-chick survival to fledging did not differ from the survival of A- and B-chicks, in the peak period. In the late period, the survival of C-chicks was significantly lower than that of A-chicks. In peak clutches manipulated such that chicks from last-laid eggs (C-chicks) hatched 24 h - 48 h ahead of the A- and B- chicks, C-chick survival was greater than in controls.

40|$|Teachers can inspire {{and motivate}} {{students}} to develop critical thinking. Successful critical thinkers can be successful and contributing citizens. According to the Oxford dictionary (2015) critical thinking is, “the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgement”. In New Zealand education, the development of critical thinking is given utmost importance, spanning from Early Childcare education to tertiary education. Critical thinking is termed as a lifelong skill by the Tertiary Education Commission in the Statement of Intent 2015 – 2019. Critical thinking {{is one of the}} fundamental requisites expected of graduates by industry, business and employers. University brochures and websites in New Zealand assure the development of critical thinking skills in graduates. Critical thinking is deemed necessary for education, employment and successful life of an individual. In spite of all this, anecdotal evidence, reinforced by extant literature, indicates that understanding of critical thinking and associated development and assessment practices are inconsistent and deserving of further research. What remains unclear at present is the quality assurance for graduates who qualify the same level qualification from different institutions in New Zealand. This current study reviews the perceptions of educators about the nature of critical thinking and identifies the teaching strategies employed by those educators to develop critical thinking skills in students in tertiary institutions in New Zealand. The research results indicate development of critical thinking <b>lays</b> <b>equal</b> emphasis on the role of students, teachers and systems.

Further, tertiary teachers face difficulty with international students.

40|$|As {{software}} undergoes evolution {{through a}} series of changes, it is necessary to validate these changes through regression testing. Regression testing becomes convenient if we can identify the program parts that are likely to be affected by the changes made to the programs as part of maintenance activity. We propose a change impact analysis mechanism as an application of slicing. A new slicing method is proposed to decompose a Java program into affected packages, classes, methods and statements identified with respect to the modification made in the program. The decomposition is based on the hierarchical characteristic of Java programs. We have proposed a suitable intermediate representation for Java programs that shows all the possible dependences among the program parts. This intermediate representation is used to perform the necessary change impact analysis using our proposed slicing technique and identify the program parts that are possibly affected by the change made to the program. The packages, classes, methods, and statements thus affected are identified by traversing the intermediate graph, first in the forward direction and then in the backward direction. Based on the change impact analysis results, we propose a regression test selection approach to select a subset of the existing test suite. The proposed approach maps the decomposed slice (comprising of the affected program parts) with the coverage information of the existing test suite to select the appropriate test cases for regression testing. All the selected test cases in the new test suite are better suited for regression testing of the modified program as they execute the affected program parts and thus have a high probability of revealing the associated faults. The regression test case selection approach promises {{to reduce the size of}} regression test suite. However, sometimes the selected test suite can still appear enormous, and strict timing constraints can hinder execution of all the test cases in the reduced test suite. Hence, it is essential to minimize the test suite. In a scenario of constrained time and budget, it is difficult for the testers to know how many minimum test cases to choose and still ensure acceptable software quality. So, we introduce novel approaches to minimize the test suite as an integer linear programming problem with optimal results. Existing research on software metrics have proven cohesion metrics as good indicator of fault-proneness. But, none of these proposed metrics are based on change impact analysis. We propose a changebased cohesion measure to compute the cohesiveness of the affected program parts. These cohesion values form the minimization criteria for minimizing the test suite. We formulate an integer linear programming model based on the cohesion values to optimize the test suite and get optimal results. Software testers always face the dilemma of enhancing the possibility of fault detection. Regression test case prioritization promises to detect the faults early in the retesting process. Thus, finding an optimal order of execution of the selected regression test cases will maximize the error detection rates at less time and cost. We propose a novel approach to identify a prioritized order of test cases in a given regression selected test suite that has a high chance of fault exposing capability. It is very likely that some test cases execute some program parts that are more prone to errors and have a greater possibility of detecting more errors early during the testing process. We identify the fault-proneness of the affected program parts by finding their coupling values. We propose to compute a new coupling metric for the affected program parts, named affected change coupling, based on which the test cases are prioritized. Our analysis shows that the test cases executing the affected program parts with high affected change coupling have a higher potential of revealing faults early than other test cases in the test suite. Testing becomes convenient if we identify the changes that require rigorous retesting instead of <b>laying</b> <b>equal</b> focus to retest all the changes. Thus, next we propose an approach to save the effort and cost of retesting by identifying and quantifying the impact of crosscutting changes on other parts of the program. We propose some metrics in this regard that are useful to the testers to take early decision on what to test more and what to test less...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} spiral-wound {{membrane}} (SWM) modules, {{which are the}} most common commercially available membrane modules for reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF). While RO membranes can remove almost all kinds of substances from the feed water, they are usually equipped with pretreatment steps for conditioning and modifying the feed water to prevent clogging and fouling of these modules. Energy consumption, fouling and concentration polarization are considered as the primary challenges in these types of RO modules. These challenging factors depend of the feed water quality and they are related directly or indirectly to the design of applied feed spacer in SWM modules. A feed spacer provides a channel between two envelopes from entrance to outlet of a module to let the water flows tangentially over the membrane surfaces from the feed to the concentrate side. Additionally, feed spacers are designed to destabilize the concentration polarization layer; and thereby increase the mass transfer in SWM modules of RO. However, application of feed spacers to efficiently mix the flow comes at the expense of higher energy consumption and fouling formation. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the hydraulic conditions inside the spacer-filled channels such as those encountered in SWM-modules of RO. Previous RO-studies related to production of drinking water are primarily performed with the assumption that RO-elements are used for desalination. In contrast to this assumption, the most commercially available configuration RO elements, SWM modules, gained more attention to be used for purification of freshwater resources currently. The main reason of using RO for freshwater purification is that it provides an effective barrier against the continuously emerging micro- and nano-contaminants, which cannot be (easily) removed by conventional treatment technologies. The energy use, scaling and retention in RO are influenced by the concentration polarization. When RO is applied on freshwater, the effects of concentration polarization on the energy use become significantly smaller because the osmotic pressure difference is negligible. This thesis is divided into two parts. In the first part, this thesis describes a unique brackish water pilot study, which operates without chemical pretreatment. Such pilot study is referred to as one step membrane filtration (OSMF) system. An OSMF-system is an NF/RO-system in which membranes are applied directly on the feed water and operate without chemical pretreatment. In the second part, this thesis focuses on the hydraulic conditions of spacer-filled channels and the role of spacer geometry and orientation thereon. The effect of feed spacers on hydraulic conditions is investigated by studying the actual velocity profiles occurring in the spacer-filled channel and the relation between energy losses and spacer geometry. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique is used to determine the orientation and configuration effects of spacers on the actual velocity profiles. PIV is a non-invasive and powerful tool to achieve high-resolution velocity profiles experimentally, which can be used for verification and validation of numerical studies related to spacer-filled channels. 2 D and 3 D numerical studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of hydraulic conditions in SWM modules of RO. However, these numerical simulations are usually validated with low-resolution experimental methods. PIV measurements from this study, thus, can provide high-resolution experimental data (7. 4 £ 7. 4 ¹m 2) for validation of these numerical studies. The first results in PIV technique is a simultaneous velocity profile, which is obtained by using each two taken frames at a determined time interval. In this thesis, the simultaneous velocity profiles are used to investigate the variation of temporal velocity at certain locations (points) inside a mesh of a spacer. The spatial velocity profiles that are discussed in this thesis obtained by computing the average of related simultaneous velocity profiles. Chapter 3 describes a detailed explanation about the experimental methods used in this thesis. Summary of chapter 3 is repeated in the experimental section of chapters 5, 6 and 7. The effect of feed spacers on hydraulic conditions is investigated by comparing an empty channel with a spacer-filled channel, which was filled with a commercial feed spacer (chapter 5). The flow in the empty channel was in a straight line from inlet to outlet and it was steady compared to the flow in the spacer-filled channel. The spatial velocity profiles of spacer-filled channels showed a bimodal shape with a peak at low-velocity ranges and a peak at high-velocity ranges. The low-velocity regimes occurred mostly in regions close to the filaments and a high-velocity regimes occurred at the narrowed parts of the channel or directly after the narrowing parts. The difference between low and high velocity regimes with regard to the velocity magnitude and frequency was higher at a higher flow. Although the increase in velocity magnitude causes generation of a higher shear, it is not necessarily beneficial. That is because the optimal flux as the results of destabilization of the concentration polarization layer will be achieved at a specific velocity. A further increase of the velocity from this optimal velocity will have only a marginal effect on destabilization of the concentration polarization layer, enhancing the flux and consequently production increase. The hydraulic conditions inside a spacer-filled channel are influenced by configuration as well as orientation of the spacer. The pressure drop, which is measured during this thesis inside the channels with commercial feed spacers was in a good agreement with pressure drop from previous mathematical models. Previous studies reported a lower pressure inside the channels with the cavity spacers than the channels with zigzag spacers. The zigzag or net-type configuration is the common configuration used in SWM of RO. In the zigzag configuration, two layers of filaments with <b>equal</b> average diameter <b>lay</b> on top of each other and make an angle of 45 o with each other (hydraulic angle) and with the flow (flow attack angle). In the cavity configuration, the diameter of transverse filaments is smaller than longitudinal filaments. Cavity spacers in this study had a flow attack angle of 135 o. The biggest ratio of transverse filaments’ diameter to channel height was about 0. 6 with cavity spacers. With cavity spacer used in this thesis, the flow was mainly in a straight line from inlet to outlet. The flow disturbance in channels with cavity spacers was at down- and upstream of transverse filaments. The flow acceleration over the transverse filaments of examined spacers was greater for cavity spacers with bigger transverse filaments. In channels with cavity spacers, the velocity was clearly higher at the channel side without transverse filaments than the channel side with transverse filaments. In channels with zigzag spacers, the flow close to the membrane was in the direction of filaments attached to the membrane, i. e. the direction of flow at the top of channel was perpendicular to the direction of flow at the bottom. The flow pattern at the middle of the channel was a combination of flow patterns at the top and bottom. The greater friction losses that were found for spacers with bigger relative height and smaller aspect ratio indicate that the orientation and geometry of transverse filaments contribute to pressure losses. However, it was not possible to find a reliable correlation for predicting the pressure losses based on the geometric characteristics of feed spacers in experimental conditions. Effect of feed spacer orientation on the flow investigated by using the same commercial spacer at two different flow attack angles. For this purpose, three feed spacers are used with different thickness. The thickness of the top and bottom filaments was the same for each spacer. Pressure drop in the channel with the thinnest spacer was clearly higher at normal orientation (with a flow attack angle of 450) than at ladder orientation (with a flow attack angle of 90 o). The difference between two orientations in the channels with thicker spacers was insignificant. The difference between the lowest and highest the velocity was greater in ladder orientation than zigzag orientation. Commercial ladder spacers with the characteristics described in this thesis are more sensitive to fouling than zigzag spacers because in ladder spacers the velocity becomes virtually zero at the side of the channel where transverse filaments are attached to the membrane. <br/...|$|R
