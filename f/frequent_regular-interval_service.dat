25|$|As {{train service}} {{patterns}} settled down {{later in the}} nineteenth century, the Caledonian main line carried important express trains, {{as well as local}} stopping trains. In contrast to the <b>frequent</b> <b>regular-interval</b> <b>services</b> of the present day, the train frequency was limited. In 1895 there were four daytime expresses northbound; the first left Euston at 5.15 a.m. Many trains divided at Carstairs with separate portions from there to Edinburgh and in some cases Perth and Aberdeen. There were two sleeping car trains to Glasgow and two to Aberdeen. All the daytime trains called at Beattock, and there were four all-stations stopping trains as well as some short workings. The fastest journey from Carlisle to Glasgow took 2 hours 10 minutes.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1990s, {{services}} were extended and the timetable provided <b>regular-interval</b> <b>services.</b> Local trains running between Wittenberge and Schwerin serve Karstädt every two hours.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, the City-Bahn {{sets were}} {{withdrawn}} for the advance {{operation of the}} S 12 S-Bahn service between Cologne and Au (Sieg), which formally commenced in 1992, but <b>regular-interval</b> <b>services</b> were maintained. Since 1999, only modern class 644 (Bombardier Talent) diesel multiple units have run on the line.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1990s, {{services}} were extended and the timetable provided <b>regular-interval</b> <b>services.</b> Since then, Grabow station has been served every two hours. The 2012 timetable provided connections on the RE 2 service from Grabow directly to Wismar, Schwerin and Ludwigslust {{in the north}} and to Wittenberge, Nauen, Berlin and Cottbus in the south.|$|R
5000|$|In local transport, for a {{long time}} there were also {{services}} over regional routes, for instance to Rahden, Bremen, Bad Bentheim, Löhne and Bielefeld. After the gradually introduction a <b>regular-interval</b> <b>service,</b> which culminated in NRW-Takt (North Rhine-Westphalia's current co-ordinated <b>regular-interval</b> <b>service),</b> the trains ran every hour on the Paderborn-Detmold-Herford route and continued alternately to/from Bielefeld (RB 72, Ostwestfalen-Bahn, [...] "East Westphalian railway") or Bad Bentheim (RB 62, Der Cherusker, [...] "The Cherusci"). An additional route ran, and continues to run, south of Lage as the RE 82 service, Der Leineweber ("The Weavers") on the (Münster -) Bielefeld - Oerlinghausen - Lage - Detmold - Altenbeken route. The latter was operated from December 2003 to December 1913 by the NordWestBahn, which earlier won a tender of the Zweckverband SPNV Münsterland (ZVM), Zweckverband Verkehrsverbund OWL (VVOWL) and Nahverkehrsverbund Paderborn-Höxter (NPH) transport associations. It is now operated by eurobahn.|$|R

50|$|The train last ran in 1991, {{by which}} time it had long since {{transferred}} its London terminus to Euston, operating as an extension to the <b>regular-interval</b> <b>service</b> over the West Coast Main Line between London and Wolverhampton. In the winter 1989-1990 timetable, it left London at 15:40, arriving Aberystwyth 21:00; the return working left Aberystwyth at 07:13, arriving London Euston at 12:24. There were no longer any through coaches to {{the northern part of}} the Cambrian Line: passengers for stations to Pwllheli had to change at Machynlleth.|$|R
50|$|The London Midland Region {{timetable}} dated 10 September 1951 {{shows an}} irregular interval service of approximately hourly trains {{to and from}} Walsall and a similar service to Lichfield City via Sutton, with some trains running {{only as far as}} Four Oaks (tables 68 and 69). In the Summer 1963 timetable, by which time diesel multiple units were operating on both routes, there was a <b>regular-interval</b> <b>service</b> pattern throughout the day: on weekdays every hour to Walsall and Rugeley Town, and every 30 minutes to Sutton and Lichfield, with occasional trains still terminating at Four Oaks.|$|R
2500|$|A {{new set of}} {{high-speed}} long-distance services was introduced in 1966, launching British Rail's highly successful [...] "Inter-City" [...] brand (the hyphen was later dropped) and offering journey times as London to Manchester or Liverpool in 2 hours 40 minutes (and even 2 hours 30 minutes for the twice-daily Manchester Pullman). A new feature was that these fast trains were offered on a <b>regular-interval</b> <b>service</b> throughout the day: hourly to Birmingham, two-hourly to Manchester, and so on. With {{the completion of the}} northern electrification in 1974, London to Glasgow journey times were reduced to 5 hours.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{delays in}} planning, {{infrastructure}} measures {{could not be}} completed {{in time for the}} timetable change in December 2015. Therefore, a transition timetable was implemented, which provides for a break in operations for most trains in Westerburg. In the northern part, which is the responsibility of SPNV Nord and NWL, the trains already ran hourly to Siegen, as provided for in the new timetable concept. In the southern part, which is mostly in the area of responsibility of the RMV, the old timetable still operates, which provides only a two-hourly <b>regular-interval</b> <b>services</b> with some additional services. The breaks that occur in Westerburg often cause waits of 24-39 minutes for the other train, which are very unattractive for passengers. The complete introduction of the new timetable is not expected before December 2017.|$|R
50|$|Over the years, {{passenger}} services were, however, {{more and more}} rationalised. Instead of the long-distance trains, <b>regular-interval</b> regional <b>services</b> had already replaced long-distance services by the mid-1980s. Although long-distance trains have been diverted over the line because of reconstruction projects, this has become rarer {{as a result of}} the rationalisation of infrastructure.|$|R

With {{the completion of the}} northern electrification in 1974, London to Glasgow journey times were reduced to 5 hours.Along with electrification came modern coaches such as the Mark 2 and from 1974 the fully integral, air-conditioned Mark 3 design. These remained the mainstay of express services until the early 2000s. Line speeds were raised to a maximum 110 mph, and these trains, hauled by Class 86 and Class 87 electric locomotives, came to be seen as BR's flagship passenger product. Passenger traffic on the WCML doubled between 1962 and 1975.|$|R
50|$|After German reunification, traffic flows changed again. Long-distance traffic {{ended in}} the 1990s, but {{integrated}} <b>regular-interval</b> regional <b>services</b> were established. In 1998, passenger services on the Wismar-Karow line were abandoned. The section from Blankenberg to Hornstorf connecting to Wismar was closed on 23 September 1999. After 2000, most sidings were dismantled and only one track {{connection between the two}} lines is left. The catenary in the branch line section of the station was removed.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} December 2010, Regionalbahn RB72 (Heidenau-Kurort Altenberg) {{services}} were running on the line; there were additional Regional-Express RE19 (Dresden Hbf-Kurort Altenberg) services run on the weekends of the winter half year. A special feature of the route is that these additional trains are only run if the conditions are appropriate for winter sports. It is announced in the traditional media on Thursdays whether they are running. The 2008 timetable included a total of 14 pairs of regional railway train running between Heidenau and Altenberg. Apart from a few gaps in the morning, a <b>regular-interval</b> hourly <b>service</b> was offered on working days. On the weekends, services ran every two hours.|$|R
50|$|The {{responsible}} {{authority for the}} provision of transport services in regional traffic is the Verkehrsverbund Oberelbe (VVO). After all transport services were retendered, they have been provided by the Städtebahn Sachsen since 12 December 2010. The services have been operated as SB72 and SE19 since then. It has a full-day <b>regular-interval</b> hourly <b>service</b> with trains crossing in Glashütte. On the weekends, the timetable remains unchanged with a two-hour cycle. In order to connect with the S-Bahn in Heidenau, the timetable has an unusual symmetry minute, which is approximately at 14 minute past the hour. Köttewitz, Weesenstein, Burkhardswalde-Maxen, Mühlbach (b Pirna), Oberschlottwitz, Bärenhecke-Johnsbach, Bärenstein (b Glashütte/Sachs) and Hartmannmühle stations are request stops. As in the past, additional direct trains are still operated between Dresden Hbf and Kurort Altenberg, only stopping at selected stations.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened, along with Nuremberg-Bamberg {{section of the}} Ludwig South-North Railway, by the Bavarian State Railway on 25 August 1844, the {{birthday}} of King Ludwig I. However, regular operations on the line commenced only on 1 September 1844, on completion of all construction work, and passenger service started a month later on 1 October 1844. The Erlangen-Gräfenberg secondary railway (Sekundärbahn Erlangen-Gräfenberg, known as the Seku) was opened to the station on 17 November 1886. The trains of the secondary line usually ended at a platform south of the station building. Due to the increasing volume of traffic, the single-track Nuremberg-Bamberg line was no longer sufficient and the line was duplicated, starting from the Nuremberg end in 1891, and put into operation from Fürth in 1892. On 1 October 1894, a suburban service commenced from Nürnberg Hauptbahnhof, {{with one of the}} services ending in Erlangen. The station was also the terminus of passenger trains on the Erlangen-Bruck-Herzogenaurach railway until passenger operations ended on 28 September 1984. The station has been served by electrically-operated services since 15 May 1939. After the Second World War and the division of Germany, the main traffic flow on the Nuremberg-Bamberg line shifted to the north on the line via Würzburg and thus the station was now served by long-distance services on this route. It lost its function as a junction with the closure of the Seku on 17 February 1963. In the late 1960s, an improved local transport <b>service</b> with dense <b>regular-interval</b> <b>services</b> was introduced on the main lines in Nuremberg, as a precursor to a possible S-Bahn system, and Erlangen was integrated in this network. The plans were confirmed in the 1980s and it was agreed that Erlangen would be included in the second stage of the Nuremberg S-Bahn network, although it was included from the beginning in the Greater Nuremberg Transport Association, which was founded on 27 September 1987. After the fall of the Wall and the reunification, long-distance services to Berlin improved considerably.|$|R
50|$|The {{route is}} part of the {{northern}} access to the Brenner railway to Italy and is thus part of the Berlin-Palermo railway axis. Non-stop travel time between Rosenheim and the border at Kufstein is 15 minutes, but due to temporary speed restrictions in most cases trains take longer. There is an hourly regional train service to Innsbruck, which requires a change in Kufstein. Every two hours, a EuroCity (EC) train operates on the route through Innsbruck and the Brenner Pass to Italy. Every two hours, Austrian Federal Railways runs Vienna-Salzburg-Innsbruck-Vorarlberg express trains over the line from South Rosenheim to Kufstein, but they do not stop. Although there are additional passenger services, there is still no <b>regular-interval</b> hourly <b>service</b> between Salzburg and Innsbruck. Currently, there are 32 scheduled services passenger services each day on the line. In addition approximately 20 freight trains operate each working day.|$|R
50|$|In 1946 and 1947 Bielefeld {{station was}} the {{headquarters}} of the railways of the American and British occupation zone (Hauptverwaltung der Eisenbahnen des amerikanischen und britischen Besatzungsgebiets), from which Deutsche Bundesbahn emerged in 1949. The last act of the Deutsche Bundesbahn, Generalbetriebsleitung (general management) West, Bielefeld was to publish the official winter timetable for the period from 2 October 1949 to 13 May 1950. The importance of the station in the railway network was consolidated with the electrification of the Hamm-Hanover main line on 29 September 1968 and the introduction of the Intercity-Express connection between Cologne and Berlin in the 1990s, stopping in Bielefeld, with connections at <b>regular-intervals</b> with regional <b>services.</b>|$|R
50|$|In July 1990, the Müglitz Valley Railway {{celebrated the}} 100th {{anniversary of the}} opening of its route. The {{economic}} upheaval that began {{as a result of}} German reunification put the continuation of operations on the line into question again. A number of industrial enterprises were closed between Heidenau and Altenberg {{at the beginning of the}} 1990s. In 1991 the VEB Zinnerz Altenberg factory was closed. Other companies were able to continue their production only to a much lesser extent. As a result, the railways lost a large part of the freight volume within a few years. The decline in traffic volume was exacerbated by the sudden increase in competition between road and rail fieight transport as well as rail passenger transport. This negative development led to the closure of the freight operations south of Köttewitz (where there is a siding to the Fluorchemie factory) in 1995. Due to the uncertain future of the route, Deutsche Bahn failed to carry out necessary investments and only remediated wear and tear. As a result of this and the further decline in passenger numbers, the decommissioning of the entire line for safety reasons was considered in 1997. Also, the timetable introduced in that year was operationally unstable during the peak hours and its <b>regular-interval</b> timetable of <b>services</b> every two hours was unattractive.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to German reunification, {{there were}} {{proposals}} for {{a connection between}} the two lines. The Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan) of 1992 initially provided for an upgrade of both the Berlin-Dresden and the Dresden-Leipzig railways for high speed. As part of the preliminary design of 1992/1993, it was planned that the line from Leipzig to Dresden would run to the south of Riesa and cross the existing line at Medessen and connect to the route from Berlin at Böhla. After optimisation, the section of new line starting at Riesa was discarded. Instead, there would be now only be the 13 km long section between Böhla and Radebeul on the Berlin-Dresden railway to be upgraded for high speeds and a new link to be built with the Leipzig-Dresden railway. This would allow about 370 million marks to be saved, the effects on nature and landscape would be significantly reduced and fast and slow traffic would be separated. According to information provided by Deutsche Bahn in 2008, the connecting curve would be the most economical solution to segregate long-distance and regional traffic by concentrating long-distance transport on the fast line to the Dresden node, while the slower traffic would remain on the existing line. Furthermore, it would separate long-distance and S-Bahn traffic between Dresden-Neustadt and Coswig. [...] An investigation of the link between the two lines was commissioned on 8 January 1993. In March 1993, the preliminary design for a link between Neumedessen (Leipzig-Dresden railway) and Böhla (Berlin-Dresden railway), including the Kockelsberg Tunnel, was confirmed. With planning expected to be completed in December 1995, it would be possible for the project to be implemented between mid-1998 and early 2000. The project would allow fast and slow traffic to be segregated on its approach to the Dresden railway mode. Since this section of the Berlin-Dresden railway was not used for regional services, it would in future be used only for long-distance passenger and fast freight traffic. In addition, the segregation of traffic would relieve the Coswig railway node of long-distance rail transport and permit the intensification of the <b>regular-interval</b> S-Bahn <b>services</b> to Meissen.|$|R
