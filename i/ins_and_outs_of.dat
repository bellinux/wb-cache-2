25|$|After the Aloha special, Parker made a {{deal that}} would later be used in court {{to prove that he}} had not acted in the best {{interests}} of Presley. He offered RCA the opportunity to buy Presley's entire back catalog for a mere $5.4 million. At the time, Presley's back catalog was not considered that important and RCA initially calculated it at being worth much less, but in later years it would become one of the most valuable catalogs in the music business. The sale of the catalog to RCA meant that after his death Presley's estate would not receive any royalties for his songs prior to 1973. To be fair to Parker, however, Presley had asked him to raise funds to pay for his upcoming divorce settlement. Presley, who was never one to know the full <b>ins</b> <b>and</b> <b>outs</b> <b>of</b> the music business, would have probably had no idea how important his back catalogue was, and therefore would have trusted Parker's judgment on the matter. Parker, too, could have never known how valuable the catalog would become.|$|E

Carter further noted that the cast were [...] "nothing more than warm bodies at points", but opined that {{the crux of the}} story and the relationship between main protagonist Soap and Captain Price was [...] "worth the price of admission". Alternatively, he found the multiplayer to be timeless, and that the design of each map held up well and felt justified. He compared the multiplayer to those offered by other first-person shooter games, such as the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series, stating [...] "There's a nice, comfortable balance between the two philosophies, to the point where it's not too alienating for folks who didn't grow up with twichy FPSes or feel like dedicating the time to learning the <b>ins</b> <b>and</b> <b>outs</b> <b>of</b> breaching and clearing each and every room, knocking on permadeath's door on every match." ...|$|E

500|$|After a few months, Elgar {{left the}} {{solicitor}} {{to embark on}} a musical career, giving piano and violin lessons and working occasionally in his father's shop. He was {{an active member of the}} Worcester Glee club, along with his father, and he accompanied singers, played the violin, composed and arranged works, and conducted for the first time. Pollitzer believed that, as a violinist, Elgar had the potential to be one of the leading soloists in the country, but Elgar himself, having heard leading virtuosi at London concerts, felt his own violin playing lacked a full enough tone, and he abandoned his ambitions to be a soloist. At twenty-two he took up the post of conductor of the attendants' band at the Worcester and County Lunatic Asylum in Powick, [...] from Worcester. The band consisted of: piccolo, flute, clarinet, two cornets, euphonium, three or four first and a similar number of second violins, occasional viola, cello, double bass and piano. Elgar coached the players and wrote and arranged their music, including quadrilles and polkas, for the unusual combination of instruments. The Musical Times wrote, [...] "This practical experience proved to be of the greatest value to the young musician. ... He acquired a practical knowledge of the capabilities of these different instruments. ... He thereby got to know intimately the tone colour, the <b>ins</b> <b>and</b> <b>outs</b> <b>of</b> these and many other instruments." [...] He held the post for five years, from 1879, travelling to Powick once a week. Another post he held in his early days was professor of the violin at the Worcester College for the Blind Sons of Gentlemen.|$|E

[...] Despite the influx of the Fraser Gold Rush in 1858–59, settlement on Burrard Inlet and English Bay was almost unknown prior to the early 1860s {{due in large part}} to the lack of interest in the area as the access to the BC interior was via the City of New Westminster and the Fraser River and also due to the power of the Squamish chiefs over the area. Robert Burnaby and Moberly camped and prospected for coal in what is now Coal Harbour in Vancouver in the summer of 1859. In general they got along fine with the native people. Robert Burnaby wrote [...] "Our [...] time has been occupied in exploring all the <b>ins</b> <b>and</b> <b>outs</b> <b>of</b> this Inlet, which I prophesy [...] will become one of the greatest naval rendezvous and centres of commerce on this side of the world."

2500|$|In 2009, {{after years}} of trying to persuade the Conservative {{movement}}’s Rabbinical Assembly that the movement needed a stronger presence in the nation’s capital, the group made the decision to appoint a Director of Public Policy, turning to Moline to serve in that position as a volunteer. He had argued that other Jewish movements had such a presence, such as the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism and the Orthodox Union’s Institute for Public Affairs, both of which are “active players in the capital.” [...] Understanding that there is a “diverse RA membership behind him and an even more diverse population of Conservative Jews,” Moline’s responsibilities were expected to focus on “broad consensus positions of the movement and on laying out broad principles based on Conservative thinking.” However, as one Washington Jewish Week article noted, “… he is also an experienced Washington player; a lot of the new Conservative movement’s impact may be under the radar with Moline at the helm.” Rabbi Jeffrey Wohlberg, then President of the Rabbinical Assembly, praised the choice of Moline for the new position, saying that “Rabbi Moline is that perfect combination of smart, well-connected, socially-savvy and thoroughly conversant on the issues of the day. In addition, he knows the <b>ins</b> <b>and</b> <b>outs</b> <b>of</b> the Washington world. His appointment ushers in an exciting new era for the Rabbinical Assembly and Conservative Judaism.” ...|$|E
