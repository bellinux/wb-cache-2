5|$|Lactarius vietus milk {{has a very}} <b>hot</b> <b>taste,</b> and the {{mushroom}} lacks a distinctive smell. Although described by many mycologists as inedible, David Pegler claims that its acrid taste can be removed after boiling, allowing it to be consumed. Though the strong, acrid taste is {{a defining feature of}} the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which is not unusual for Lactarius species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes.|$|E
5|$|Aroma {{compounds}} {{are responsible}} for the particular odour or taste in some species, e.g. sotolon in the fenugreek-smelling Lactarius helvus, or the similar quabalactone III in Lactarius rubidus which causes a maple syrup-like odour in dried specimens. Pigments have been isolated from brightly coloured species, e.g. (7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate from the blue Lactarius indigo or russulaflavidin and a derivative from the yellow Russula flavida. Some Russula species contain pigmented pteridine derivatives called russupteridines that are not found in the milk-caps. Sesquiterpenes are characteristic secondary metabolites of many Russulaceae, especially milk-caps which have been quite intensively studied. They are thought to be responsible for the <b>hot</b> <b>taste</b> in many species and may have deterrent, antifeeding functions in nature.|$|E
25|$|The phytochemicals {{responsible}} for the sharp flavor of garlic are produced when the plant's cells are damaged. When a cell is broken by chopping, chewing, or crushing, enzymes stored in cell vacuoles trigger the breakdown of several sulfur-containing compounds stored in the cell fluids (cytosol). The resultant compounds are {{responsible for}} the sharp or <b>hot</b> <b>taste</b> and strong smell of garlic. Some of the compounds are unstable and continue to react over time. Among the members of the onion family, garlic has by far the highest concentrations of initial reaction products, making garlic much more potent than onion, shallot, or leeks. Although many humans enjoy the taste of garlic, these compounds are believed to have evolved as a defensive mechanism, deterring animals such as birds, insects, and worms from eating the plant. Because of this, people throughout history have used garlic to keep away insects such as mosquitoes and slugs.|$|E
40|$|Examination of {{selected}} natural and synthetic 1, 4 - -dialdehydes {{has shown that}} <b>hot</b> <b>tasting</b> molecules react with methylamine in biomimctic conditions while their tasteless isomers do not. The in vitro reactivity correlates with the biological activity of compounds with comparable molecular shapes and dimensions. The course of the in vitro reaction {{and the nature of}} the products have been monitored by 'H-NMR, showing that a common charged azomethine intermediate is involved. We suggest that the biological mechanism of <b>hot</b> <b>tasting</b> dialdehydes may include covalent binding to primary amino groups of taste receptors...|$|R
50|$|Russula pseudointegra is an inedible, quite rare {{mushroom}} of {{the genus}} Russula, with a similar habitat and appearance to Russula rosea. Russula pseudointegra is distinguished by its <b>hot</b> <b>tasting</b> flesh.|$|R

500|$|Variations on the {{preparation}} and {{presentation of the}} angels on horseback vary considerably. In Feng Shui Food, it is prepared by rolling a shucked oyster in bacon and skewering it with a cocktail stick, fried and served with a squeeze of lime. Joanna Pruess's book Seduced by Bacon includes a recipe for [...] "Angels and Devils", with the suggestion that [...] "a little hot red pepper sauce can transform them from heavenly to hellishly <b>hot</b> <b>tasting,</b> or somewhere inbetween." [...] Myles Bader, author of The Wizard of Food's Encyclopedia of Kitchen & Cooking Secrets, suggests serving angels on horseback on toast with a lemon wedge or hollandaise sauce. An Italian variant replaces bacon with prosciutto.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} types of gudeg; dry, wet, Yogyakarta style, Solo style and East Javanese style. Dry gudeg has only a bit of coconut milk and thus has little sauce. Wet gudeg {{includes}} more coconut milk. The most common gudeg comes from Yogyakarta, and is usually sweeter, drier and reddish in color because of the addition of teak leaves as coloring agent. Solo gudeg {{from the city of}} Surakarta is more watery and soupy, with lots of coconut milk, and is whitish in color because teak leaves are generally not added. Yogyakarta's gudeg is usually called [...] "red gudeg", while Solo's gudeg is also called [...] "white gudeg". The East-Javanese style of gudeg has a spicier and <b>hotter</b> <b>taste</b> compared to the Yogyakarta style gudeg, which is sweeter.|$|R
50|$|Saus Cabai (Indonesia) or Sos Cili (Malaysia), a {{category}} of its own, uses tomato puree, chili juice, sugar, salt and some other spices or seasonings to give the spicy, but not too <b>hot,</b> <b>taste.</b> Some countryside commercial varieties use bird's eye chili (cili padi, cabai rawit or burung) together with its seeds to {{raise the level of}} heat (piquancy) of the sauce. Variants include the typical concoctions with ginger and garlic (for chicken rice) and variants that are made into gummy consistency as with ketchup/tomato sauce.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} time {{of producing}} kulen is during the pig slaughter done every autumn by most households. Kulen matures during the winter; {{it can be}} eaten at this time, although not fully dried and cured yet, with very <b>hot</b> <b>taste,</b> but it will develop its full taste by the following summer. To produce a dryer, firmer kulen, it is sometimes kept buried under ashes, which act as a desiccant. Kulen is a shelf-stable meat product, with a shelf life of {{up to two years}} when stored properly.|$|E
50|$|Bitter and hot taste: The <b>hot</b> <b>taste</b> of yakju {{is caused}} by the {{alcoholic}} substance. In case of medicinal liquor, the bitterness of the medicinal herbs used affects the taste of liquor, and yeast itself gives the bitter taste. Proper bitterness stimulates your appetite. The alcohol content of traditional spirits ranges from 11% to 18%. When selecting a yakju, it is recommended to consider the harmonized taste instead of alcohol content. The longer the time of fermentation is, the higher the alcohol content is and the deeper the taste is.|$|E

50|$|The betel leaf, {{which is}} native to the Indian subcontinent, {{has been used for}} 5000 years. About 50 years ago, the Mysore betel leaves were grown in the gardens of the Mysore Maharaja and were later spread to 100 acres from Poorniah Choultry in Old Agrahara to Vidyaranyapuram junction, which connects the Mysore-Nanjangud Road in Mysore. Gradually, it was spread to about 500 acres around Mysore. Unique climate and soil in this stretch is thought to have given the leaves a unique taste that earned it the name ‘Mysore Chigurele’ (Mysore sprout leaf). The leaf has a smooth texture and <b>hot</b> <b>taste.</b>|$|E
