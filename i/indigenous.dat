5|$|Bancroft is a {{director}} of the Australian <b>Indigenous</b> Mentoring Experience, a not-for-profit organisation that aims to increase senior high school and university admission rates for <b>Indigenous</b> students. She has taught and mentored <b>Indigenous</b> school students such as Jessica Birk, a winner of the Australia Council's inaugural Emerging and Young Artist Award in May 2009.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the 1950s and 1960s that <b>indigenous</b> artists such as Mungo Martin, Bill Reid and Norval Morrisseau began to {{publicly}} renew and re-invent <b>indigenous</b> art traditions. Currently there are <b>indigenous</b> artists practising in all media in Canada and two <b>indigenous</b> artists, Edward Poitras and Rebecca Belmore, have represented Canada at the Venice Biennale in 1995 and 2005 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{established}} twenty-one missions, <b>indigenous</b> peoples (the so-called Mission Indians) {{lived and}} worked {{under the supervision of}} missionaries. However, approximately 80% of the approximately 100,000 to 300,000 <b>indigenous</b> population of California remained outside the Missions. Spanish law fully recognized the customary title of <b>indigenous</b> peoples. Spanish-era land grants are referred to as the Ranchos of California.|$|E
5|$|The ADO {{is seeking}} to expand the number of <b>Indigenous</b> Australians it {{recruits}} and improve their retention rate. Restrictions on <b>Indigenous</b> Australians' ability to enlist in the military existed until the 1970s, though hundreds of <b>Indigenous</b> men and women had joined the military when restrictions were reduced during the world wars. By 1992 the representation of <b>Indigenous</b> Australians in the ADF was equivalent to their proportion of the Australian population, though {{they continue to be}} under-represented among the officer corps. Two of the Army's three Regional Force Surveillance Units (NORFORCE and the 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment) are manned mostly by <b>Indigenous</b> Australian reservists. In 2015 <b>Indigenous</b> Australians made up around 1.5% of ADF personnel, which is smaller than the <b>Indigenous</b> share of the total Australian population.|$|E
5|$|This {{combination}} creates sounds {{similar to}} <b>indigenous</b> Australian music, which later segues into a European style {{before returning to}} its original theme. The overall effect is a fusion of <b>indigenous</b> Australian music, rock, and improvisational jazz by European Australians, before <b>indigenous</b> rock artists Yothu Yindi and No Fixed Address created their own fusions of <b>indigenous</b> and rock music.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2010 Malaysian census, {{the town}} of Sibu (excluding {{suburban}} area) has total population of 162,676. Chinese (62.1%, 101,019) is the largest ethnic group in the town, followed by <b>indigenous</b> people (35.01%, 56,949), non-Malaysians (1.99%, 3,236), and Indians (0.37%, 598). Among the <b>indigenous</b> tribes, there are Iban (26,777), Malays (16,646), Melanau (10,028), Bidayuh (1,337), and other <b>indigenous</b> tribes (874). A majority of the non-Malaysians are Indonesian workers employed at plywood and sawmills factories. There are also a number of illegal workers employed by syndicates to tap rubber. A number of foreign Chinese nationals and Indonesians are also working in massage parlours.|$|E
5|$|Anniversary of the 1967 {{referendum}}, 27 May – The {{anniversary of}} the 1967 referendum to amend the federal constitution has also been suggested. The amendments enabled the federal parliament to legislate with regard to <b>Indigenous</b> Australians and allowed for <b>Indigenous</b> Australians {{to be included in}} the national census. The public vote in favour was 90.77%.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1955, {{the number}} of day schools run by Indian Affairs {{expanded}} from 9,532 to 17,947. The growth in day schools was accompanied by {{an amendment to the}} Indian Act in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial and territorial governments and school boards regarding the education of <b>Indigenous</b> students in the public school system. These changes were indicative of the government's shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration of <b>Indigenous</b> students into public schools. It was believed that <b>Indigenous</b> children would receive a better education {{as a result of their}} transition into the public school system.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary <b>Indigenous</b> art of {{the western}} desert began when <b>Indigenous</b> men at Papunya began {{painting}} in 1971, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across <b>Indigenous</b> communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all {{of the founders of}} the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting.|$|E
5|$|Dodd's career {{returned}} to politically contentious <b>Indigenous</b> issues {{when he played}} a minor role, of Kummengu, in the 1991 film Deadly. This film is a police drama based around {{the death of an}} <b>Indigenous</b> man in police custody. As in Ground Zero, the subject was very topical: the movie was released {{at the same time as}} the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which had for four years been examining why so many <b>Indigenous</b> Australians died in police detention.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan pursued similar reforms {{with respect}} to <b>Indigenous</b> Australians. In 1962, the Aboriginal Affairs Bill was {{introduced}} to liberalise constraints that had been placed on <b>Indigenous</b> Australians {{in the past and}} had effectively resulted in segregation. The initial proposal still retained some restrictions, placing more controls over full-blooded Aborigines. Dunstan was prominent in Labor's opposition to the double standards, and called for abolition of race-based restrictions, saying that social objectives could be achieved without explicit colour-based schemes. He was successful in forcing amendments to liberalise controls on property and the confinement of <b>Indigenous</b> Australians to reserves. However, his attempt to remove the different standards required of part and full-blooded Aborigines failed, as did his proposal to ensure that {{at least half of the}} members of the Aboriginal Affairs Board be <b>Indigenous</b> Australians. Despite the passage of the bill, restrictions remained in place and Dunstan questioned the policy of assimilation of Aborigines, which he saw as the diluting of their distinctive cultures.|$|E
5|$|In general, Uyghurs and {{the mostly}} Han {{government}} disagree on which group has greater historical {{claim to the}} Xinjiang region: Uyghurs believe their ancestors were <b>indigenous</b> to the area, whereas government policy considers present-day Xinjiang to have belonged to China since around 200BC. According to PRC policy, Uyghurs are classified as a National Minority rather than an <b>indigenous</b> group—in other words, they {{are considered to be}} no more <b>indigenous</b> to Xinjiang than the Han, and have no special rights to the land under the law. The People's Republic has presided over the migration into Xinjiang of millions of Han, who dominate the region economically and politically.|$|E
5|$|In taking office, Morales {{emphasized}} nationalism, anti-imperialism, and anti-neoliberalism, although did {{not initially}} refer to his administration as socialist. In what was widely termed a populist act, he immediately reduced both his own presidential wage {{and that of}} his ministers by 57% to $1,875 a month, also urging members of Congress to do the same. Morales gathered together a largely inexperienced cabinet made up of <b>indigenous</b> activists and leftist intellectuals, although over {{the first three years of}} government there was a rapid turnover in the cabinet as Morales replaced many of the <b>indigenous</b> members with trained middle-class leftist politicians. By 2012 only 3 of the 20 cabinet members identified as <b>indigenous.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, {{when the}} Spanish {{colonisation}} {{in the area}} began, El Hatillo was inhabited by the Mariches, an <b>indigenous</b> people possibly related to the Kalina (Caribs). Cacique Tamanaco {{was the leader of}} these tribes, known for resisting the Spanish colonisation. As the colonisation developed, the <b>indigenous</b> inhabitants were killed; by order of Caracas's founder Diego de Losada, Tamanaco was also murdered.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} before federation, the colonial {{government}} recognised that British education and <b>indigenous</b> culture was influencing {{a new generation of}} Iban teachers. Thus, on 15 September 1958, the Borneo Literature Bureau was inaugurated with a charter to nurture and encourage local literature while also supporting the government in its release of documentation, particularly in technical and instructional manuscripts that were to be distributed to the <b>indigenous</b> peoples of Sarawak and Sabah. As well as <b>indigenous</b> languages, documents would also be published in English, Chinese and Malay. In 1977, the bureau came under the authority of the federal government language planning and development agency, the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP), which advocated publication only in Malay ultimately causing the demise of fledgling <b>indigenous</b> literature.|$|E
5|$|<b>Indigenous</b> land {{owners have}} {{consistently}} opposed uranium mining and have spoken {{out about the}} adverse impact it has on their communities. The British nuclear tests at Maralinga {{were found to have}} left significant radiation hazards in land given back to the Maralinga Tjarutja people, and the issue continues to cause <b>indigenous</b> opposition.|$|E
5|$|<b>Indigenous</b> peoples were {{producing}} art {{for thousands}} of years before the arrival of European settler colonists and the eventual establishment of Canada as a nation state. Like the peoples who produced them, <b>indigenous</b> art traditions spanned territories across North America. <b>Indigenous</b> art traditions are organized by art historians according to cultural, linguistic or regional groups: Northwest Coast, Plateau, Plains, Eastern Woodlands, Subarctic, and Arctic.|$|E
5|$|It {{was known}} to <b>Indigenous</b> Australians before its {{discovery}} and naming by Europeans; for example, the Gunai people of Gippsland called it birrna. Because of its wide range {{it would have a}} name {{in a number of other}} <b>indigenous</b> languages, but these are now lost. In 2001, a search of historical archives for recorded <b>indigenous</b> names of Victorian flora and fauna failed to find a single name for the species.|$|E

5|$|Morales {{announced}} {{that one of}} the top priorities of his government was to eliminate racism against the country's <b>indigenous</b> population. To do this, he {{announced that}} all civil servants were required to learn one of Bolivia's three <b>indigenous</b> languages, Quechua, Aymara, or Guaraní, within two years. His government encouraged the development of <b>indigenous</b> cultural projects, and sought to encourage more <b>indigenous</b> people to attend university; by 2008, it was estimated that half of the students enrolled in Bolivia's 11 public universities were <b>indigenous,</b> while three indigenous-specific universities had been established, offering subsidized education. In 2009, a Vice Ministry for Decolonization was established, which proceeded to pass the 2010 Law against Racism and Discrimination banning the espousal of racist views in private or public institutions.|$|E
5|$|On June 22, 2015, Rachel Notley, Premier of the {{province}} of Alberta, issued a formal apology as a Ministerial Statement {{in a bid to}} begin to address the wrongs done by the government to the <b>Indigenous</b> peoples of Alberta and the rest of Canada. Notley's provincial government called on the federal government to hold an inquiry on the missing and murdered <b>Indigenous</b> women in Canada at the same time. They also stated their intent to build relationships with provincial leaders of <b>Indigenous</b> communities, and sought to amend the provincial curriculum to include the history of <b>Indigenous</b> culture.|$|E
5|$|The 1963 census {{indicated}} that 47% of Nigerians were Muslim, 35% Christian, and 18% members of local <b>indigenous</b> congregations. If accurate, this indicated a sharp increase since 1953 {{in the number}} of Christians (up 23%); a decline among those professing <b>indigenous</b> beliefs, compared with 20%; and only a modest (6%) drop of Muslims which can likely be attributed to immigration, emigration, and birthrate.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Games {{have been}} criticised as {{upholding}} (and {{in some cases}} increasing) the colonial policies and practices of some host nations and cities either {{in the name of}} the Olympics by associated parties or directly by official Olympic bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, host organising committees and official sponsors. Critics have argued that the Olympics have engaged in or caused erroneous anthropological and colonial knowledge production, erasure, commodification and appropriation of <b>indigenous</b> ceremonies and symbolism, theft and inappropriate display of <b>indigenous</b> objects, further encroachment on and support of the theft of <b>indigenous</b> lands, and neglect and/or intensification of poor social conditions for <b>indigenous</b> peoples. Such practices have been observed at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri; the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec; the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta; and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish conquest had as its {{principal}} aims the physical {{incorporation of the}} <b>indigenous</b> peoples of Chiapas into the Spanish Empire, and their spiritual conversion to Christianity. This involved the dismantling of <b>indigenous</b> power structures, the destruction of pagan temples and idols, the concentration of <b>indigenous</b> populations in centralised settlements that could be more easily controlled and evangelised, the incorporation of these new settlements into the Spanish system of tributes and taxes, {{and the introduction of}} Christian imagery. One side of this involved armed struggle and the imposition of Spanish colonial administration by force; the religious side of this struggle was the generally peaceful conversion of <b>indigenous</b> populations to Christianity. In Chiapas, such evangelisation efforts were generally carried out by the Dominican Order. The Dominicans became involved in the concentration of Indians into new settlements, the construction of churches and convents, and the religious instruction of the natives.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of <b>Indigenous</b> Peoples {{recognized}} {{the urgent need}} to respect and promote the rights of <b>indigenous</b> peoples affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with States. It {{also noted that the}} rights affirmed in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements between States and <b>indigenous</b> peoples are, in some situations, matters of international concern, interest, responsibility and character. In many instances the minority rights treaties provided for arbitration and granted the International Court of Justice jurisdiction to resolve disputes.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasive}} algae {{are regularly}} monitored and removed {{to protect the}} benthic habitat. <b>Indigenous</b> sorts of cultivated plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous. Those include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed. Even the <b>indigenous</b> breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{reductions}} were self-sufficient <b>indigenous</b> {{communities of}} 2,000–4,000 inhabitants, usually headed by two Jesuit priests and the cabildo (town council and cacique (tribal leader), who retained their functions {{and played the}} role of intermediaries between the native peoples and the Jesuits. However, {{the degree to which the}} Jesuits controlled the <b>indigenous</b> population for which they had responsibility and the degree to which they allowed <b>indigenous</b> culture to function is a matter of debate, and the social organization of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the one hand, to theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being much closer to the mark.|$|E
5|$|The {{residential}} school system harmed <b>Indigenous</b> children significantly by removing {{them from their}} families, depriving them of their ancestral languages, exposing many of them to physical and sexual abuse, and forcibly enfranchising them. Disconnected from their families and culture and forced to speak English or French, students who attended the {{residential school}} system often graduated unable to fit into either their communities or Canadian society. It ultimately proved successful in disrupting the transmission of <b>Indigenous</b> practices and beliefs across generations. The legacy of the system {{has been linked to}} an increased prevalence of post-traumatic stress, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide, which persist within <b>Indigenous</b> communities.|$|E
5|$|The three largest <b>indigenous</b> {{group in}} Sabah are the Kadazan-Dusun, Bajau and Murut; {{followed}} by the Bruneian Malays, Suluk and other <b>indigenous,</b> while the Chinese makes up the main non-indigenous population.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the modern}} period the {{situation}} of <b>indigenous</b> languages has grown increasingly precarious in Mexico, and the numbers of speakers of virtually all <b>indigenous</b> languages have dwindled. Although the absolute number of Nahuatl speakers has actually risen over the past century, <b>indigenous</b> populations have become increasingly marginalized in Mexican society. In 1895, Nahuatl was spoken by over 5% of the population. By 2000, this proportion had fallen to 1.49%. Given the process of marginalization combined with the trend of migration to urban areas and to the United States, some linguists are warning of impending language death. At present Nahuatl is mostly spoken in rural areas by an impoverished class of <b>indigenous</b> subsistence agriculturists. According to the Mexican national statistics institute, INEGI, 51% of Nahuatl speakers {{are involved in the}} farming sector and 6 in 10 receive no wages or less than the minimum wage.|$|E
5|$|Various {{commentators}} {{noted that}} there was a renewed sense of pride among the country's <b>indigenous</b> population following Morales' election. Conversely, the opposition accused Morales' administration of aggravating racial tensions between <b>indigenous,</b> white, and mestizo populations, with some non-indigenous Bolivians feeling that they were now experiencing racism.|$|E
25|$|To {{celebrate}} the strong <b>Indigenous</b> {{ties to the}} game, the NRL holds a preseason All Stars game, featuring a team made up of <b>Indigenous</b> Australians playing a publicly voted team consisting of the non-Indigenous players, and an <b>Indigenous</b> Leadership Group has formed, consisting of the game's elite <b>Indigenous</b> players. The Leadership Group hosts regular multi-day camps where all <b>Indigenous</b> NRL players are invited {{to learn more about}} <b>Indigenous</b> culture.|$|E
