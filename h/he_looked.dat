5|$|Rutherford gave Chadwick a {{part-time}} teaching position at Manchester, {{allowing him to}} continue research. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> at the nuclear charge of platinum, silver, and copper, and experimentally found {{that this was the}} same as the atomic number within an error of less than 1.5 per cent. In April 1919, Rutherford became director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and Chadwick joined him there a few months later. Chadwick was awarded a Clerk-Maxwell studentship in 1920, and enrolled as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The first half of his thesis was his work with atomic numbers. In the second, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> at the forces inside the nucleus. His degree was awarded in June 1921. In November, he became a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College.|$|E

5|$|In 1780, in {{his first}} {{discussion}} of purely religious matters, Espejo wrote a theological letter, Carta al Padre la Graña sobre indulgencias (Letter to Father la Graña about indulgences).

5|$|Irenaeus' eschatology {{was based}} on a literal {{interpretation}} of the Bible, especially the Book of Revelation. He believed that there would be 6000 years of suffering before the world ends in a fiery purge. This fire would purify believers ahead of a new human community existing in the New Jerusalem. The afterlife, Irenaeus proposed, focuses more on time than space; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> forward to a time in which humans are fully developed and live the life of God.|$|E
