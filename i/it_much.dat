5|$|A {{juvenile}} {{often has}} a dark, brownish-grey nape that may look {{darker than the}} pale-edged black feathers.

5|$|Alex Parker, {{the leader}} of the team that {{performed}} the analysis of the images at the Southwest Research Institute, said that S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit appears to be aligned edge-on to Earth-based observatories. This would make <b>it</b> <b>much</b> more difficult to detect because it would be lost in Makemake's glare much of the time and, along with its dark surface, would contribute to previous surveys failing to observe it.|$|E
5|$|Although {{initially}} {{skeptical about}} the role, Perrineau took it after Lost creator J. J. Abrams told him more about <b>it.</b> <b>Much</b> of the first season arc for Michael was rewritten; he was originally {{going to be part}} of a love triangle with Korean couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), but positive fan reaction to the couple meant this storyline was dropped. After Michael leaves the Island in season two, Perrineau knew he would return to Lost at some point; he felt there was more to tell of Michael's story. Reception for the character was mixed. However, Perrineau's acting was praised.|$|E

5|$|An avid cyclist, Bonds {{chose the}} {{activity}} to be a {{primary means of}} keeping in shape and great passion since his playing career.

5|$|In an {{interview}} with Fortune magazine, Activision's CEO of Publishing Eric Hirshberg found that even after five years without a game, the Guitar Hero brand still enjoyed high social media attention, with over 10 million followers on the Guitar Heros Facebook page.

5|$|In some units the {{alternator}} {{is essentially}} the same as that used in portable generating sets used to supply mains power, modified to produce a higher current at a lower voltage but still at the 50 or 60Hz grid frequency. In higher-quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency, such as 400Hz. The smaller amount of time the high-frequency waveform spends near zero makes <b>it</b> <b>much</b> easier to strike and maintain a stable arc than with the cheaper grid-frequency sets or grid-frequency mains-powered units.|$|E

5|$|Messiaen's {{music has}} been {{described}} as outside the western musical tradition, although growing out of that tradition and being influenced by <b>it.</b> <b>Much</b> of his output denies the western conventions of forward motion, development and diatonic harmonic resolution. This is partly due to the symmetries of his technique—for instance the modes of limited transposition do not admit the conventional cadences found in western classical music.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{government}} in England had traditionally centred on several great offices of state, filled by powerful, independent {{members of the}} baronage. Henry abandoned this policy, leaving the post of justiciar vacant and turning the position of chancellor into a more junior role. A small royal council was formed but its role was ill-defined; appointments, patronage, and policy were decided personally by Henry and his immediate advisers, rather than through the larger councils that had marked his early years. The changes made <b>it</b> <b>much</b> harder for those outside Henry's inner circle to influence policy or to pursue legitimate grievances, particularly against the King's friends.|$|E

5|$|As {{happened}} to {{other members of}} the royal family, Boril's ascension forced Strez and his closest supporters to flee, in that case to neighbouring Serbia, where he was welcomed by the reigning Stefan Nemanjić (1196–1228) in 1207 or early 1208. Even though Boril requested the extradition of Strez to Bulgaria, the Serbian ruler hoped to use Strez as a puppet in gaining Bulgarian-held territory. Stefan believed that Strez's royal ancestry and imperial aspirations would make <b>it</b> <b>much</b> easier to impose Serbian rule over Macedonia, Kosovo and Braničevo, as well as Belgrade, all captured by Bulgaria under Kaloyan. At the same time, Boril was unable to take military action against Strez and his Serbian patron, as he had suffered a major defeat {{at the hands of the}} Latins at Plovdiv. Stefan went as far as to become a blood brother of Strez in a ceremony which Stefan was hoping would secure Strez's loyalty.|$|E
5|$|At the north-west {{corner of}} the walls stands Arundel tower, another large drum tower that {{originally}} overlooked a small cliff. South of this is Catchcold tower. Catchcold tower {{was designed to be}} defended with guns and has three gunports; the need to support cannon leaves <b>it</b> <b>much</b> heavier in appearance than the other circular towers on the walls. The remains of machine gun mountings fitted to the tower in 1941 can still be seen. The Arcades form part of the surviving west walls and are a unique feature in England; their closest architectural equivalent are in Rouen, France. The West Gate still stands three storeys high and was originally defended by two portcullises; the windows {{on the west side of}} the gate are the original medieval designs. Along the south side of the walls one of the twin towers protecting the South Gate still stands, largely intact.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August, all of Bonanza Creek {{had been}} claimed by miners. A {{prospector}} then advanced up {{into one of the}} creeks feeding into Bonanza, later to be named Eldorado Creek. He discovered new sources of gold there, which would prove to be even richer than those on Bonanza. Claims began to be sold between miners and speculators for considerable sums. Just before Christmas, word of the gold reached Circle City. Despite the winter, many prospectors immediately left for the Yukon by dog-sled, eager to reach the region before the best claims were taken. The outside world was still largely unaware of the news and although Canadian officials had managed {{to send a message to}} their superiors in Ottawa about the finds and influx of prospectors, the government did not give <b>it</b> <b>much</b> attention. The winter prevented river traffic, and it was not until June 1897 that the first boats left the area, carrying the freshly mined gold and the full story of the discoveries.|$|E
