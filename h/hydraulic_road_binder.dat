40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} the results of tests on road base used in the construction and maintenance of roads stabilised with hydraulic binders. Seven hydraulic binder mixes were prepared under laboratory conditions by mixing three basic components: Portland cement CEM I 32. 5 R, fluidized bed combustion ash (PF) and cement kiln dust (CKD). The proportions of the binder components were established in accordance with the experimental design. The percentage share of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>road</b> <b>binder</b> in the bound mix was 6 %. Two types of natural aggregates were used for the base. The percentage shares of the individual components in the mix were designed using the Proctor method. For pastes, made from binders, basic mechanical properties were determined. To assess the effect of binders on the properties of the base stabilised with hydraulically bound mixtures tests were conducted to measure the following: compressive strength after 7, 14, 28 and 42 days of curing, freeze-thaw resistance. Experimental results demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} determine the optimal composition of hydraulic binders for the required strength class of the base course...|$|E

In order to tackle this task, the present investigation aims to analyse alternative uses of bottom ash and fly ash as part of construction materials for different applications: bottom ash-based ceramic bricks, bottom ash as pozzolanic material in the cement production, waste stabilisation/solidification of hazardous wastes using ash-based geopolymers, and ash-based geopolymers used as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>road</b> <b>binders</b> (HRB).|$|R
30|$|The present {{investigation}} aims to analyse alternative uses of bottom ash and fly ash {{as part of}} construction materials for different applications: bottom ash-based ceramic bricks, pozzolanic material in the cement production, waste stabilisation/solidification of an electric arc furnace dust using ash-based geopolymers, and ash-based geopolymers used as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>road</b> <b>binders.</b> Different replacements of natural materials by different fly and/or bottom ashes have been studied in all the cases. This study has analysed various parameters influencing the manufacturing process, {{with the aim of}} reducing the energy consumption of these processes, as they have been, for example, the firing temperature of bricks and grind size of bottom ashes in cements. All materials are manufactured in a simple and economical way, in order not to increase the cost of the products, and the final products have been evaluated according to different European standards used in these applications, in order to assess their possible, actual technical feasibility. The results obtained in this study show that even higher ratios of replacement (> 40  %) of ashes have properties similar to those commonly used.|$|R
40|$|In the {{construction}} of roads or railways, the capping layer is the last layer of the earthworks phase. This layer can be made of non bound aggregates or by a treatment of a soil with lime and/or hydraulic binder, such as cement or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>road</b> <b>binders.</b> In the latter case, the in situ testing of the capping layer performances should encompass treated soil modulus measurements, but sampling such materials is not often satisfactory, {{because of the risk}} of material degradation by the sampling itself. Consequently, a non destructive method, aiming at measuring the modulus of the treated materials, could be very useful. For this reason, we propose to study the feasibility of the seismic surface or guided waves dispersion analysis in order to recover the depth and the S wave velocity of the subgrade. Previous works provided results and analysis of the dispersion curves concerning the pavement auscultation (Ryden et al, 2004). However, in these cases, the subgrade was an underlying layer in the global zone of interest that includes the upper pavement layers where the measurement surface is the thin asphalt layer. In the present study, we focus on the subgrade layer in the case of under construction roads, before the shallower pavement layers are built because it should help to qualify the project acceptance concerning this earthworks phase. In this context, the issue deals with a two layers medium case where the investigated subgrade, whom the top is the measurement surface, lays above a low velocity zone, i. e. the natural soil. As described by Ryden et al. (2004), the resulting dispersion curves {{in the case of a}} high velocity upper layer should be typical of Lamb waves dispersion curves and could bring out higher modes that could be difficult to pick. In this case, they advocated the entire dispersion diagram inversion to avoid any subjective picking in the data (Ryden et al, 2006). However, the treated soil can contain heterogeneities unfavourable to the assumption of homogeneous layers presupposed to the dispersion diagram calculation. Thus a first feasibility stage, i. e. a field experimental data acquisition, was conducted to define the ability of seismic data to provide a coherent dispersion diagram in the spectral content required. The dispersion curve have been extracted and inverted with an iterative weighted least squares local minimization method (Hermann, 2002). In order to consider the possibility of inverting the entire dispersion diagram, a second feasibility stage consisted in analysing all the events that possibly occur in the dispersion diagram. For that, the measurement experience was reproduced at reduced scale in laboratory as a perfectly controlled experimental modelling approach. These data and more precisely the dispersion diagram is compared in one hand to the theoretical curves associated to the leakage attenuations and in an other hand to the theoretical dispersion diagram numerically calculated with an original method taking into account the source effects...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{will focus}} on recent {{advances}} {{for the production of}} biosourced <b>road</b> <b>binders</b> as an alternative to bitumen. Indeed, in recent years, tensions have appeared on the asphalt supply for road construction. Thus, valorization of different types of biomass for the production of alternative binders might be attractive. The more developed alternative binder is based on the high molecular weight material, generally from the wood industry, mixed with mineral or vegetable viscous oil. The resulting binder has characteristics similar to bitumen and has been used on several experimental road work sites. In some cases, aging issues of the binder occurred, with a brittle behavior at service temperature. Other promising biomasses have been studied, such as microalgae and swine manure, using hydrothermal liquefaction. The resulting binders appear to have the same rheological properties as asphalts. Vegetable resources are also used to produce fluxes, whose main advantage is the reduction of emissions of dangerous organic volatile compounds. Finally, research on new biomasses shows a credible alternative for future full or partial replacement of bitumen...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a quantitative feedback control system for a three-axis <b>hydraulic</b> <b>road</b> simulator.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis considers the optimisation of vehicle suspension systems via a reinforcement learning technique The aim is to assess the potential of learning automata to learn 'optimum' control of suspension systems, which contain some active element under electronic control, without recourse to system models. Control optimisation tasks on full-active and senu-active suspension systems are used for the feasibility assessment and subsequent development of the learning automata technique. The quarter-vehicle simulation model, with ideal full-active suspension actuation, provides a well-known environment for initial studies applying classical discrete learning automata to learn the controller gains of a linear state-feedback controller. Learning automata are shown {{to be capable of}} acquiring near optimal controllers without any explicit knowledge of the suspension environment. However, the methodology has to be developed to allow safe on-line application. A moderator is introduced to prevent excessive suspension deviations as a result of possible unstable control actions applied during learning. A hardware trial is successfully implemented on a test vehicle fitted with semi-active suspension, excited by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>road</b> simulation rig. During these initial studies some inherent weaknesses of the discrete automata are noted A discrete action set provides insufficient coverage of a continuous controller space so optima may be overlooked. Subsequent methods to increase the resolution of search lead to a forced convergence and hence an increased likelihood of local optima location. Th 1 s motivates {{the development of a new}} formulation of learning automaton, the CARLA, which exhibits a continuous action space and a reinforcement generalisation. The new method is compared w 1 th discrete automata on vanous stochastic function optimisatwn case stui 1 es, demonstrating that the new functionality of CARLA overcomes many of the identified shortcomings of discrete automata. Furthermore, CARLA shows a potential capability to learn in non-stationary environments. Repeatmg the earlier suspension tasks with CARLA applied, including an on-line hardware study, further demonstrates a performance gain over discrete automata Finally, a complex multi-goal learning task is considered A dynamic roll-control strategy is formulated based on the senu-active suspension hardware of the test vehicle. The CARLA is applied to the free parameters of this strategy and is seen to successfully synthesise improved roll-control over passive suspension...|$|R

40|$|The {{ride comfort}} in heavy {{commercial}} trucks {{is an important}} property that requires detailed testing to investigate how different vehicle components affect the response to road input. Trucks come in many different configurations and a customer purchasing a new truck often has the choice to specify number of axles, drive line and cabin type, type of suspension and so on. This gives {{that there are many}} vehicle variations that have to be tested to ensure good ride comfort. Testing many combinations of, for example, dampers in different environments and road conditions might be time consuming. The work could be helped by pre-test computer simulations where the vehicle is simulated with the same conditions as in the tests. The simulation results could then be used to better understand how different components affect the vehicle response to a certain road input. By using a MultiBody System (MBS) software, a full truck could be modeled and simulated to acquire accurate results. The simulation would however be computationally demanding and take long time. It also requires that the test engineer is familiar with the MBS software to be able to create the model and run the simulations. This thesis focuses on investigating if simplified dynamic truck models developed in Matlab could be an alternative to more complex models created in an MBS software. Three different models are developed: a quarter car model, a 2 D half truck model and a 3 D truck model. The models are derived using the Lagrangian energy method and the dynamic response from a given road input is calculated numerically in Matlab. Different methods of solving the systems of differential equations are discussed and the implementation of the implicit Newmark -method is explained. To validate the truck models and solver, the models are replicated in the MBS software Adams View. The response of the Adams and Matlab models from an excitation on the wheels are compared to determine that the equations and solver are correctly derived and implemented. To test the models capabilities to predict the response in a real truck, tests on a road simulator are performed. A four-wheel Scania tractor is tested in a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>road</b> simulator rig. The road simulator excited the truck through the wheels with a sinus sweep from 0 - 20 Hz and the resulting accelerations in the tractor are measured. Three different setups of front axle dampers are tested to get a parameter variation to study with the models: a standard damper, harder damper and undamped front axle. The same tests are simulated in Matlab and the acceleration responses are compared to see how well the models predict the accelerations seen in the real truck. The models in Matlab and Adams give the same results and are therefore reasoned to be mathematically correct. The Newmark -method is efficient and gives reasonable computing times. In the comparison with the road simulator test the models do not give the same results as measured on the truck. To be able to compare the results from the measurements and simulations, the tire stiffnesses have to be trimmed so that the correct eigenfrequency of the axles are found. The results with modified tire stiffnesses give better results but still with considerable deviations from the experimental results. The measurements on the truck show that the eigenfrequency of the front axle decrease when removing the front axle damper while the models show that the eigenfrequency increase. Also there are differences in the acceleration measured in the cabin and frame as the models do not predict many of the higher eigenfrequencies. In conclusion it is discussed that the models have to be more complex to give useful information about the effects of variation of dampers on the axles. It is also discussed that using commercially available software to perform the same simulations might be a better alternative that gives the user more freedom to overlook and make changes to the model...|$|R
40|$|Traffic calming {{is usually}} {{implemented}} {{to manage and}} to slow down fast vehicular flows in residential areas, to avoid queues, to increase traffic fluidity, etc. Sometimes {{it is useful to}} make intersections safer for pedestrians, but it is seldom designed to guarantee also comfort, ease and accessibility for vulnerable users. The common cliché that roundabouts are more suitable to calm drivers than to make pedestrians crossing is the result of this kind of old design practice, that doesn't take into account the context of application. These are also the reasons why roundabouts are preferably located at intersections with high traffic volumes, than in quiet residential streets. On the contrary, in zones with low traffic and speed limits, intersections, if re-designed according to the formal schemes of small/medium roundabouts, are very suitable to become protected, comfortable and appealing places for pedestrians, besides being safe junctions for drivers. This paper deals with two case studies of the research "Widespread interventions in urban areas for the creation of best solutions for the pedestrian mobility", funded by MIUR - Ministry of the Education and University and run by DITS - Department of <b>Hydraulic</b> Transportation and <b>Roads,</b> of University "La Sapienza" of Rom...|$|R
