40|$|This {{monograph}} {{examines the}} reasons for recent reforms to the legislative framework for fraud, <b>forgery</b> and identity <b>offences</b> in NSW, and makes comparisons with Commonwealth and interstate provisions {{in light of the}} objective of national consistency. The increase in maximum penalties evinces a clear intention by Parliament that the courts are to treat these crimes as serious and that harsher sentences are to be imposed. This study: examines {{the reasons for}} the reforms sets out the legislative framework for fraud, <b>forgery</b> and identity <b>offences</b> in NSW makes comparisons with Commonwealth and interstate provisions in light of the objective of national consistency concludes with a discussion of the applicable sentencing principles in such cases. The fraud, <b>forgery</b> and identity <b>offences</b> in NSW are to be prosecuted summarily unless an election is made to proceed on indictment. Early indications that lower numbers of offences are being sentenced in the District Court than in the Local Court seem to confirm that the bulk of these offences will be dealt with summarily, but may also reflect that major frauds often take considerable time to detect and then prosecute...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the changing}} nature of organised and serious crime following the peace process in Northern Ireland which officially commenced in 1998. The paper examines those social and situational factors which have led to a rise in crimes perpetrated by both paramilitary Republican and Loyalist organisations, and by the so-called ‘ordinary decent criminals’ (ODCs) unrelated to paramilitary groups. These social and situational factors include political, security and economic variables. As such, Northern Ireland is an important case study of the political context of crime. Whilst the peace process is a positive development, the political transition has had associated unintended effects. The fact that rising crime has resulted from political change should not be taken as an argument against the peace process. Serious crime is defined as indictable offences which by their nature attracts substantial terms of imprisonment. Organised crime is defined in accordance with the National Criminal Intelligence Service as three or more individuals engaging in long-term profit-driven criminal activity (NCIS, 2001). Thus organised crime may include serious offences and other <b>offences</b> (<b>forgery,</b> theft) if they occur as part of organised criminality. The problems surrounding this definition will also be addressed later in the paper...|$|R
