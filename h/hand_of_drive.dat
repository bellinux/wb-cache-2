Can this be done in Ireland? If it cannot, what is the reason? For Ireland produces some of the best farmers in the world, and because of their climate and the productivity of their soil, they have, as I have seen for myself, much spare time to devote to the serviced of their country. That is my Speculation No. 1. Speculation No. 2 concerns itself with the age-old problem, in Ireland, of winter dairying. Speculation No. 3 : What has happened in Irish livestock circles? Part of the British war effort was to intensify the fight against disease. Is enough being done here outside the efforts of some few dozen devoted men...|$|R
5000|$|While in WCW, Guerrero {{shared the}} limelight with his uncle Eddie, {{becoming}} a reluctant ally of his uncle's. As {{part of their}} storyline, Eddie continually tried to make Guerrero adopt Eddie's cheating tactics, but he often refused to do so. Eventually, Guerrero's treatment at the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> Eddie would <b>drive</b> him [...] "crazy," [...] and he adopted the gimmick of a psycho fixated with a hobby horse he dubbed [...] "Pepé." [...] This led to a feud with Norman Smiley in which Pepé was thrown into a woodchipper. Another result of his insanity was his inability to join Eddie's Latino World Order stable, which was a take-off of the nWo. On June 14, 1998, Guerrero defeated his uncle Eddie at the Great American Bash PPV. In July 1998 at the Bash at the Beach PPV, Guerrero faced Stevie Ray in a [...] "tune up match" [...] before he faced Eddie in a Hair vs Hair match, a match where the winner gets to shave his opponent's hair. Guerrero lost and began to shave his own hair off.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s he built Owlpen, York Drive, Bowdon where he {{developed}} a two-acre garden, all up the left <b>hand</b> side <b>of</b> York <b>Drive</b> and Theobald Road. At {{the end of the}} plot near to the Lady of the Vale Convent he spent the whole of the 1930s developing the garden and built The Barn out of reclaimed handmade bricks and old oak beams and with a Priest's Hole. During this time he became an expert on delphiniums and wrote The Book of the Delphinium (1932) and The Garden Grows (1935) on the building of the garden. He bred pedigree pigs and had an interest in bee-keeping. In 1936 he created 'Claudius the Bee' for the Manchester Evening News for which Walt Disney bought the film rights. In that same year he wrote Airdays, based on his experiences as a pioneer of gliding and light-aeroplane flying in Great Britain. The house itself named 'The Badgers', in Theobald Road Bowdon, was built after the war in 1948. He is said to have helped fund the neighbouring Bollingworth House given by Fanny Baxter to establish Our Lady of the Vale Convent on condition that he reserved the right to use an entrance from Theobald Road. His wife Sarah lived there {{for the last five years}} of her life.|$|R

The 1994 Speedster was designed to be a more focused [...] "driver's car" [...] and served as a hybrid between a 964 Carrera 2 Cabriolet and a 964 RS. While it featured a softer suspension set up than the 964 RS, it offered almost none of the comforts of a normal 964 Carrera 2 Cabriolet, though power windows were standard and it {{was available}} with air conditioning and a stereo. Porsche planned to build 3000 examples of the 1994 Speedsters in 1992, but only 936 examples were built and sold during the two years of production. Once again, the United States was the most important market with 427 Speedsters heading Stateside. Right hand drive versions were exceptionally rare this time, with only 14 cars having the steering wheel on the ‘proper’ side compared to 139 examples in right <b>hand</b> <b>drive</b> <b>of</b> the pre-964 911 Speedster.
