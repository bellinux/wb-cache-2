5|$|Largely {{concerned}} with gender issues, Midas {{comments on the}} definitions of femininity and masculinity in the <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century and the developing ideology of separate spheres which encouraged women to restrict themselves to domestic affairs and men to political affairs. Part of the Romantic interest in rewriting classical myths, Midas focuses on challenging patriarchy and satirising the unbounded accumulation of wealth.|$|E

5|$|Romanticism in Scotland was an artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that developed between {{the late eighteenth}} and the <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> centuries.

25|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was probably}} copied in western France, perhaps at Fleury Abbey. The riddle was added {{after the completion}} of the main contents, fairly certainly at Fleury Abbey, in the tenth century, but the language of the text is older, of the eighth century.

Thelnetham windmill worked by wind power until 1924, latterly on two sails, after which it became derelict.|$|E
5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were noisy and unmannerly, and dramatic presentations in the <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one {{sat down in the}} pit, one could easily miss the subtleties of the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, Neoclassical {{architectural}} elements {{began to}} appear in the federal style row homes, such as iconic columns in the porticoes and classic motifs over doorways and windows. Many Federal-style row houses were modernized by placing a Greek-style porch at the front. Greek and Roman elements were integrated into public buildings such as the old City Hall, the old Norfolk Academy, and the Customs House.|$|E

50|$|Franklin Gothic {{itself is}} an extra-bold {{sans-serif}} type.

Historian Alexander Lawson speculated that Franklin Gothic was influenced by Berthold’s Akzidenz-Grotesk types but offered no evidence to support this theory which was later presented as fact by Philip Meggs and Rob Carter. It was named in honor of a prolific American printer, Benjamin Franklin. The faces were issued over a period of ten years, all of which were designed by Benton and issued by A.T.F.|$|R

5|$|The Nemesis of Faith is an epistolary {{philosophical}} {{novel by}} James Anthony Froude published in 1849. Partly autobiographical, the novel depicts {{the causes and}} consequences of a young priest's crisis of faith. Like many of his contemporaries, Froude came to question his Christian faith in light of <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century developments in history, theology, and science. Froude was particularly influenced by the Catholic teachings of the Oxford Movement and by the new approach to religious scholarship developed by the German Higher Critics.|$|E
5|$|As {{elsewhere}} in Western Europe, {{in the nineteenth}} century there was a return to Medieval styles, grouped together into a Gothic revival. Early examples included Adams' St George's Episcopal Chapel in Edinburgh (1792), which included octagonal lantern on ogival arches. Other examples included James Playfair's chapel-like Farnell Church (c. 1789) and Richard Crichton's towered Craig Parish Church (1799). In the <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century examples influenced by the English Perpendicular included Glenorchy Church (1810–11), built by the Earl of Breadalbane, John Paterson's octagonal reconstruction of St Paul's Church, Perth (c. 1800–07) and Fetteresso Church, Stonehaven (1810–12). Examples of a more explicitly perpendicular form can be seen in Gillespie Graham's Collace (1813), or David Hamilton's Old Erskine (1813–14).|$|E
50|$|The 1975 {{nomination}} to the NRHP was written by an architectural historian of Atlanta, Elizabeth Z. Macgregor. She named no original or subsequent architect to be credited, but she knowledgeably described the building in some detail as quite a competent work, finding it:significantarchitecturally {{as an example of}} the Second Renaissance Revival style structure. In the Rome area this is the only building designed in this style. / From a strict sense the U. S. Post Office and Courthouse is a combination of details of decorative relief work reflective of the <b>earlier</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century Renaissance Revival Italian Mode; however the general effect is a well coordinated horizontal design that has obvious influences from the later Second Renaissance Revival.|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} both South African and South American plants {{were placed in}} this same genus. By the <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century Amaryllis had become a {{polymorphic}} (diverse) genus with about 50 species from what we would consider a dozen genera today, and {{attempts were made to}} separate it into different genera. This work commenced in 1819 with the contributions of the English botanist, the Revd. William Herbert in Curtis's Botanical Magazine which he expanded in 1821 in The Botanical Register, identifying 14 species of the new genus of Hippeastrum, and only leaving three species in Amaryllis. The rest of the Amaryllis species he transferred to other genera, several of which he created. Herbert further refined his descriptions of Hippeastrum in his work on the Amaryllidaceae in 1837.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the late}} eighteenth and <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> centuries, Cumaná {{experienced}} an increase in population. The areas around the castles and the Manzanares River became densely populated. New buildings were constructed that were attached to the castle walls, completely closing off the perimeter and making direct access impossible. Another earthquake in 1929 left the structure in ruins and rendered it unusable. The offices of the seat of government for the Province of Cumaná were moved elsewhere and the building was abandoned. The castle was declared a Cultural and Municipal Asset in May 2005 by the state Cultural Assets Institute.|$|E
5|$|Buckland had not {{provided}} a specific name, as {{was not uncommon}} in the <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, when the genus was still seen as the more essential concept. In 1826, Ferdinand von Ritgen gave this dinosaur a complete binomial, Megalosaurus conybeari, which however was not much used by later authors and is now considered a nomen oblitum. A year later, in 1827, Gideon Mantell included Megalosaurus in his geological survey of southeastern England, and assigned the species its current valid binomial name, Megalosaurus bucklandii. Until recently, the form Megalosaurus bucklandi was often used, a variant first published in 1832 by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer – and sometimes erroneously ascribed to von Ritgen – but the more original M. bucklandii has priority.|$|E

5|$|Characters of Shakespear's Plays is an 1817 book of {{criticism}} of Shakespeare's plays, written by <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century English essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt. Composed {{in reaction to the}} neoclassical approach to Shakespeare's plays typified by Samuel Johnson, it was among the first English-language studies of Shakespeare's plays to follow the manner of German critic August Wilhelm Schlegel, and, with the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, {{paved the way for the}} increased appreciation of Shakespeare's genius that was characteristic of later nineteenth-century criticism. It was also the first book to cover all of Shakespeare's plays, intended as a guide for the general reader.|$|E
5|$|Cooley {{maintained}} friendly {{relations and}} {{trade with the}} Seminole Indians in the area. In the <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, Creek Indians had moved from Alabama and joined the Seminoles. In 1835, white settlers killed Creek chief Alibama and burned his hut in a dispute. As Justice of the Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released due to insufficient evidence after a hearing at the Monroe County Court in Key West. The Creek people blamed Cooley, saying he withheld evidence. The growing uneasiness between the Creeks and the whites led to the Creeks' emigration to the Okeechobee area.|$|E
5|$|In most {{theories}} up to {{the eighteenth}} century, light was pictured as being made up of particles. Since particle models cannot easily account for the refraction, diffraction and birefringence of light, wave theories of light were proposed by René Descartes (1637), Robert Hooke (1665), and Christiaan Huygens (1678); however, particle models remained dominant, chiefly due {{to the influence of}} Isaac Newton. In the <b>early</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell's prediction that light was an electromagnetic wave—which was confirmed experimentally in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz's detection of radio waves—seemed to be the final blow to particle models of light.|$|E
50|$|The 1928 {{maternity}} ward, which replaced this <b>earlier</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century building, was a {{reinforced concrete}} building designed by prominent and innovative local architect POE Hawkes. Many of the state's maternity wards were constructed {{to a standard}} plan, based on pavilion planning principles with surrounding verandahs and all beds in the ward located near on operable opening. Attached {{to the rear of}} the wards by an open verandah or covered walk way was a septic ward. The plan of the Maryborough maternity ward was longer than the standard plan accommodating twenty five beds, nine private wards, matron's office, doctor's room, kitchenette, two labour wards, septic wards, sterilising room and matron's quarters. The building incorporated many features standard to 1920s maternity hospitals including a septic ward separated by verandahs. The Lady Musgrave Maternity Ward was opened on 24 November 1928 to co-incide with the opening of nurses' quarters.|$|R
