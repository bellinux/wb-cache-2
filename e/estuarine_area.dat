2500|$|The name of Surabaya, Indonesia, is locally {{believed}} {{to be derived from}} the words [...] "suro" [...] (shark) and [...] "boyo" [...] (crocodile), two creatures which, in a local myth, fought each other in order to gain the title of [...] "the strongest and most powerful animal" [...] in the area. It was said that the two powerful animals agreed for a truce and set boundaries; that the shark's domain would be in the sea while the crocodile's domain would be on the land. However one day the shark swam into the river estuary to hunt, this angered the crocodile, who declared it his territory. The Shark argued that the river was a water-realm which meant that it was shark territory, while the crocodile argued that the river flowed deep inland, so it was therefore crocodile territory. A ferocious fight resumed as the two animals bit each other. Finally the shark was badly bitten and fled to the open sea, and the crocodile finally ruled the <b>estuarine</b> <b>area</b> that today is the city.|$|E

40|$|Mercury {{distribution}} and fractionation were determined in sediments from the Paraíba do Sul River – RJ, Brazil. Total mercury concentration ranged from 1 to 158 ng g- 1. Hg {{associated with the}} weakly bound fraction was dominant in the <b>estuarine</b> <b>areas</b> (main - 60 % and secondary - 55 %); followed by fluvial end member (48 %) and mangrove (18 %). These results reinforce the mercury availability to fluvial and <b>estuarine</b> <b>areas</b> and emphasize the key role played by mangroves as an efficient biogeochemical barrier. In conclusion, the continuous reduction of the mangrove ecosystem around the world can exacerbate the damage resulting from the mercury accumulation...|$|R

50|$|Avicennia marina, {{commonly}} known as grey mangrove or white mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree classified in the plant family Acanthaceae (formerly in the Verbenaceae or Avicenniaceae). As with other mangroves, it occurs in the intertidal zones of <b>estuarine</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R
50|$|It has {{its source}} in the Tenasserim Hills and flows from north to south, the {{northern}} branch of the Tenasserim River running parallel to it. It ends in the Andaman Sea coast. In the last stretch of its course it forms a navigable estuary before it meets the sea.Off the shore {{there are a number}} of small islands on the western side of the <b>estuarine</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} the Colares {{stingray}} appears restricted {{to the mouth of}} the Amazon River in northern Brazil, in the <b>estuarine</b> <b>area</b> affected by the river's freshwater discharge; it may also occur in adjacent areas as far as Venezuela. Found to a depth of 6 m, this species conducts annual movements that are influenced by salinity: in the dry season it is found in the coastal bays such as Marajó, while in the rainy season it leaves the bays and shifts offshore.|$|E
50|$|The Clyde Farm Site (7NC-E-6) is a prehistoric {{archaeological site}} in rural New Castle County, Delaware. Its main {{features}} are {{remnants of a}} pit-house, storage area, and hearth, dating to c. 1000 BCE. Another area where stone tools were produced was also identified during excavations in 1984. The site has been known, {{and the subject of}} both amateur and professional archaeological interest, since at least the 1930s. It is described as being located near the fall line of a waterway and also an <b>estuarine</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ocypode ghost crabs {{construct}} {{simple to}} complex deep burrows in soft sandy and/or muddy substrates. They {{can be found}} in sandy beaches, rubble flats, and in <b>estuarine</b> <b>areas.</b> They are nocturnal and are generalist scavengers and predators of small animals.|$|R

50|$|The slender giant moray {{is found}} in the Indo-West Pacific Ocean from the Red Sea and East Africa to the western Pacific. It {{generally}} lives in the benthic muddy environments of marine and <b>estuarine</b> <b>areas,</b> including inner bays and rivers.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the less}} common {{stingrays}} within its range, the sharpsnout stingray is found in nearshore, brackish waters along the northeastern coast of South America, from Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago to northern Brazil; many occur in the <b>estuarine</b> <b>area</b> affected by the freshwater discharge of the Amazon River. It favors muddy habitats 5 - 25 m deep, with low visibility. However, Uyeno et al. (1983) gave a depth of 810 m for this species. The sharpsnout stingray conducts annual movements that are affected by salinity, entering coastal bays such as Marajó Bay {{during the rainy season}} and shifting to offshore waters during the rainy season.|$|E
5000|$|Meola Creek drains into an <b>estuarine</b> <b>area</b> of the mid-Waitemata Harbour, on a low-lying {{part of the}} Auckland isthmus. This {{receiving}} environment {{has one of the}} longest histories of urbanisation in the Auckland region. The area around the estuary is actually a natural flood plain, much of which has been converted to parks and playing fields. Fortunately, {{a good portion of the}} mangrove forest remains intact. Te Tokaroa (Meola Reef) next to Point Chevalier forms the northern part of a 10 km long lava flow that originated from Mount Saint John volcano and flowed down a narrow creek valley. The reef extends for over 2 km across the Waitemata Harbour ...|$|E
50|$|Pozhi is {{a natural}} {{phenomena}} of formation of a sand bar along the coast separating sea and backwaters in the peninsula areas during summer season but which erode during the monsoon season, allowing the sea to be merged with the backwaters. Paravur backwaters' on both the north (Thanni beach) and south ends (Thekkumbhagam beach) have Pozhi. Both meet the Arabian Sea in the district's beach faces. There is an artificial tidal-regulator in the spillway bridge at Pozhikara <b>estuarine</b> <b>area,</b> constructed in 1957 to control the salt water intrusion into Paravur Lake. This phenomenon provides abundant water for {{people living in the}} Grama panchayats of Ithikkara, Velinalloor, Pooyappally, Adichanalloor, parts of Poothakkulam, Polachira, Mayyanad, Chirakkara, Chathannoor, Elakamon, Edava and the Paravur municipal area.|$|E
25|$|During its formation, {{the empire}} was {{organised}} in three main zones — the estuarine capital region centred on Palembang, the Musi River basin {{which served as}} hinterland and source of valuable goods, and rival <b>estuarine</b> <b>areas</b> capable of forming rival power centres. These rival <b>estuarine</b> <b>areas,</b> through raids and conquests, were held under Srivijayan power, such as the Batanghari estuarine (Malayu in Jambi). Several strategic ports also included places like Bangka Island (Kota Kapur), ports and kingdoms in Java (highly possible Tarumanagara and Kalingga), Kedah and Chaiya in Malay peninsula, and Lamuri and Pannai in northern Sumatra. There are also reports mentioning the Java-Srivijayan raids on Southern Cambodia (Mekong estuarine) and ports of Champa.|$|R
