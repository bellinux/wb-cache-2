40|$|Drilling of pre-laminated particleboards is {{a subject}} insufficiently covered by {{dedicated}} research. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to examine the relationship of some key drilling parameters and analyze the variation of the thrust force, torque and surface delamination with the feed per tooth and <b>drill</b> <b>tip</b> angle at drilling pre-laminated particleboard. The surface quality was evaluated by the size of delaminations, at the exit side of the drill bit. To assess the defect, two non-dimensional parameters were used: the common delamination factor Fd based on the measurement of diameters of the circle circumscribing the defect and of the processed hole, and a new delamination factor, FdS, proposed by the authors and based on the effective measurements of the defect area with an image processing software. The experiments were performed on a range of feed per tooth rates from 0. 1 to 0. 7 mm and four flat <b>drill</b> <b>tip</b> angles: 30 °, 60 °, 90 °, 120 °. The results showed that, a low feed rate generally minimizes both the drilling torque and the thrust force and also the delamination, while a small tip angle increases the drilling torque and generally minimizes the thrust force and delamination. The drill with T 30 tip angle made exception from this trend, due to its geometry that caused the highest thrust force. The flat drill with 60 ° tip angle gave the best quality for small feed rates, while inducing the smallest thrust force, which makes it the preferable recommendation, amongst the tools tested, for drilling pre-laminated particleboard...|$|E

A microdrilling technique that uses progressive pecking and micromist coolant is developed that allows drilling of 127 micrometers diameter microholes with an aspect ratio of 10 : 1. The drilling parameters, dominant wear pattern, hole positioning accuracy and effect of AlTiN tool coating are experimentally determined. The experimental data trend agrees with classical Taylor's machining equation. Despite of fragile and long microdrills, the progressive pecking cycle and micromist allowed deep hole drilling on all the tested materials. Drill wear is more pronounced at outer cutting edge due to higher cutting speeds. However, when drilling 316 L stainless steel attrition wear at chisel edge is dominant.

40|$|Abstract — We are {{investigating}} the use of photoacoustic (PA) imaging to detect critical structures, such as the carotid artery, that may be located behind the bone being drilled during robot-assisted endonasal transsphenoidal surgery. In this system, the laser is mounted on the drill (via an optical fiber) and the 2 D ultrasound (US) probe is placed elsewhere on the skull. Both the drill and the US probe are tracked relative to the patient reference frame. PA imaging provides two advantages compared to conventional B-mode US: (1) the laser penetrates thin layers of bone, and (2) the PA image displays targets {{that are in the}} laser path. Thus, the laser can be used to (non-invasively) extend the drill axis, thereby enabling reliable detection of critical structures that may reside in the drill path. This setup creates a challenging alignment problem, however, because the US probe must be placed so that its image plane intersects the laser line in the neighborhood of the target anatomy (as estimated from preoperative images). This paper reports on a navigation system developed to assist with this task, and the results of phantom experiments that demonstrate that a critical structure can be detected with an accuracy of approximately 1 mm relative to the <b>drill</b> <b>tip.</b> I...|$|E
