40|$|The Montelukast sodium is a leukotrine {{receptor}} antagonist {{used for}} the maintenance treatment of asthma, chronic asthma attacks and to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies. The biological half life of montelukast sodium is 2. 5 to 5. 5 hrs and poor bioavailability upto 64 %. Because of poor bioavailability of montelukast sodium by oral route, {{there is a need}} to increase its bioavailability by formulating it into buccal dosage forms. Hence, montelukast sodium is a suitable drug for buccal dosage forms and may provide a better therapeutic profile than oral route. In the present piece of research work, montelukast sodium buccal films were prepared using different mucoadhesive polymers like <b>hydroxy</b> <b>propyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> (5 cps), Eudragit RL- 100, poly vinyl pyrrolidone K- 30, and different grades of carbopol (like carbopol- 934, carbopol- 940, carbopol- 971 P and carbopol- 974 P) by solvent casting technique. Buccal films were characterized for number of parameters like physical appearance and surface texture, weight uniformity, thickness, folding endurance, swelling index, surface pH, in vitro residence time, drugâ€“excipients interaction study, drug content uniformity and in vitro drug release study. FT-IR studies revealed that, there was no interaction between drug and excipients used. From this study it was concluded that the film containing 5 mg of montelukast sodium were prepared by using eudragit RL 100 with <b>hydroxy</b> <b>propyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose,</b> <b>hydroxy</b> <b>propyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> with carbopol 934, and <b>hydroxy</b> <b>propyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> with carbopol 940 (F 3, F 4, and F 5 formulations) were best formulations.

40|$|The Common Cold {{remains the}} most {{frequent}} symptomatic viral infection in man. Current best therapies are all symptomatic. New pharmacological therapies {{are likely to be}} prescription-bound, and as most Common Cold infections are successfully treated without the intervention of a Physician, {{there is a need for}} effective non-prescription therapy options. Aim of this study is to propose a new type of approach, based on the concept of making a hostile biological environment for virus survival and spreading at the point of infection, the nasopharynx. The hypothesis was advanced that infections could be controlled using a physical biological approach to create an environment at the point of infection, that is inhibitory to the survival, and persistence of infecting virus, and of viruses newly released from infected mucosal epithelial cells. A nasal irrigation spray, designed to deliver a low pH gel to the nasal cavity, was developed and tested in this study. The study was a randomised, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of three formulations of irrigation nasal spray in 441 subjects. The objective was to test whether the formulations reduced Cold severity and Cold duration compared to a placebo nasal spray. Subjects were recruited, and supplied with the product when healthy, and were instructed to begin treating and recording symptom severity once they experienced the "first signs" of a Common Cold. To qualify, subjects had to volunteer that they had at least one of the symptoms: sore/scratchy throat, runny nose or congested nose. The product was used 4 times daily, with at least 4 hours separating each dose, for a maximum of 7 days. Efficacy was assessed by an Interactive Voice Recall System whereby subjects were required to contact the investigation site, by telephone, twice daily when they were asked to assess the severity of their symptoms using a four point ordinal scale where 0 = "absent", and 3 = "severe". The symptoms assessed were sore throat, runny nose, blocked nose, cough and tired/run-down feeling. Two formulations demonstrated significant effects. A <b>hydroxy</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>propyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> based formulation reduced symptom severity compared with placebo by 17 % and a Poloxamer based formulation reduced severity by 21 %. Duration of illness was reduced with a <b>hydroxy</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>propyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> based formulation by 1. 5 days to 2. 4 days (according to the dose) and by a Poloxamer based formulation by 2. 5 days.

We have {{performed}} and evaluated a composite combining PL DLLA and PCa {{able to have}} a better control of the hydrolysis and maintain of the mechanical property on time, until wound healing was achieved. Bioabsorbable osteoconductive composite is devoted to the development of resorbable osteosynthesis for spine and osteoarticular surgeries. Such resorbable osteosynthesis will be associated to new bone substitute having high osteogenic property but without initial mechanical property. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the resorption kinetic of a composite using PL DLLA (Poly [L-Lactide-co-D,L-Lactide] acide) charged with PCa granules and the interaction with injectable bioceramic without self hardening. MBCP gel Â® is a composite associating a mineral phase of an intimate nanoscale melting of hydroxyapatite and beta tri calcium phosphate and an aqueous phase containing a synthetic polymer derived from <b>cellulose</b> HPMC (hydroxyl <b>propyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose)</b> ...|$|R

In India, indigenous remedies {{have been used in}} the treatment of cough and cold since the time of Charka and Sushruta (6 th century BC). Plants have always been an exemplary source of drugs and many of the currently available drugs have been derived directly or indirectly from them. The many herbal remedy is available in the common lady kitchen. Following all data and knowledge taste masked chewable tablet was prepared using tulsi powder, Ginger powder, Black pepper powder, Clove powder, Nutmeg powder, Cinnamon powder anrd Cardamom powder with hydroxyl <b>propyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose</b> (HPMC 0. 1 %w/w) as a taste masking agent. Tablet were evaluated for Weight variation test, Friability, Hardness and Time required for complete chewing and are found to be in acceptable limits...|$|R

The present study has been carried out to develop matrix type transdermal films containing Enalapril maleate with different ratios of HPMC (hydroxyl <b>propyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose)</b> alone, EC (ethyl cellulose) alone and combination of both HPMC & EC. Propylene glycol 3 % is used as plasticizer and span 80 is used as permeation enhancer. Formulated transdermal films were evaluated with regard to physicochemical characteristics, in-vitro permeation studies and analysed by using various kinetic models. Kinetic data revealed that the drug release followed first order kinetics and the mechanism of release was found to be non fickian diffusion. The results of the study shows that Enalapril maleate could be administered transdermally through the matrix type TDDS for effective control of hypertension, congestive heart failure and angina pectoris...|$|R
