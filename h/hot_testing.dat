Ceramic one-piece stators were fabricated of two materials, silicon nitride and silicon carbide, using two near-net-shape processes, slip casting and injection molding. Non-destructive evaluation tests were conducted on all stators identifying irregularities which could contribute to failures under durability testing. Development of the test rig and automatic control system for repeatably controlling air flow rate and temperature over a highly transient durability duty cycle is discussed. Durability results are presented for repeated thermal cycle testing of the ceramic one-piece stators.

40|$|Wastewater at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is collected, evaporated, {{and stored}} in the Melton Valley Storage Tanks (MVST) and Bethel Valley Evaporator Storage Tanks (BVEST) pending {{treatment}} for disposal. In addition, some sludges and supernatants also requiring treatment remain in two inactive tank systems: the gunite and associated tanks (GAAT) and the old hydrofracture (OHF) tank. The waste consists of two phases: sludge and supernatant. The sludges contain a high amount of radioactivity, and some are classified as TRU sludges. Some Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) metal concentrations are high enough to be defined as RCRA hazardous; therefore, these sludges are presumed to be mixed TRU waste.

40|$|AbstractRepository {{programs}} {{throughout the}} world have been slowed by the need for increased local public involvement in the siting and licensing process. The result has been an increase in the dry storage of used fuel at reactor sites and the potential that such storage may be extended for many decades, even centuries. While there are sound technical reasons to believe that dry storage can be conducted safely, there are increasing concerns that the ultimate transfer to either a future repository or a centralized separations plant may result in fractured cladding and serious handling issues, including criticality concerns. These concerns would be increased for higher burn-up fuels. Currently, various chemical pre-treatment processes under R&D for application to commercial used oxide fuel have been investigated at the laboratory scale as methods to simplify and increase the safety of the remaining stages of conventional solvent extraction processing. This includes advanced decladding methods and various oxidation/reduction processes designed to release volatile and semi-volatile fission products, produce finely divided uranium oxide powder, and ameliorate the subsequent nitric acid dissolution step. The paper examines the potential for combining several chemical and physical pre-treatment steps to minimize long-term concerns about safe transport of used fuel, possibly providing another option for future nuclear waste management. Laboratory data from both cold and <b>hot</b> <b>testing</b> will provide the basis for the evaluation. An example of a potential pre-treatment process includes shearing, advanced voloxidation and off-gas treatment, the possible mixing of the resulting uranium oxide with a secondary oxide, and densification and recanning in nitric acid-soluble storage containers for extended time periods. Chemical decladding may be feasible to replace shearing. Zirconium recycle may also be feasible, significantly reducing high level waste quantities.

40|$|ABSTRACT 1. Human {{resources}} - For automakers, {{the total}} cost of paying average workers is around $ 40000 per year (mean value); the numbers range from $ 30000 to $ 60000 (except for a Central European facility where it is much lower). On average, direct pay is three times the amount of benefits. In general, worker qualification does not affect the benefits policy within an automobile engine plant. - Overall, the average age of workers in engine plants is slightly above 40 years old. There is no difference by geographic region. In older engine plants, workers do tend to be older. Annual turnover rates are around 5 %. Mean values for unionization levels are 7990 for hourly workers, 45 % for salaried workers. It is common for production workers to be assigned different tasks; the engine plants where the union contract restricts the kind of activities are located in North America. - A majority of engine plants surveyed have work teams, and they are deployed in all departments. In most cases, work teams were introduced about five years ago. Sometimes, work team leaders are not elected. The average training received is 41 hours per employee per year. Fluctuations in the values are large. European facilities tend to have more training. Respondents felt that inspecting one's work, being well trained, designing one?s workplace and having suggestions accepted are factors which can help workers make high quality engines. Workers and management interact via meetings and surveys. There are usually fewer than 2 suggestions per worker per year. The more training people get, {{the more likely they are}} to make suggestions. 2. Logistics - Delivery of parts to the assembly department of engine plants: the Japanese-owned facilities get a much higher fraction of these components delivered more than once per shift, compared to other plants. There are more instances of "just-in-time" practice for castings and parts delivered to the machining departments. - Engine and vehicle assembly plants: for half of our sample, the average delivery pace of finished engines to the car assembly plant is once per shift or more frequently. Engine plants which deliver engines very frequently no matter how far their customer vehicle assembly plants are located. The average value of the average delivery size of finished engines is 273 units (the results are very variable, but in general, the more engines are produced per unit time, the larger the batch size). For one out of two engine plants, the average transit time to the customer vehicle assembly plant is less than half a day; however, there are many cases where finished engines are delivered to vehicle assembly plants located very far away. 3. Maintenance policies - Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is in place in all of the plants surveyed, but this is quite recent (implementation started between 1990 and 1994). In two out of three cases, it is based on a centralized planning and information system. All of the key maintenance items mentioned in the questionnaire are taken care of by all engine plants; however, the frequency at which maintenance is done varies a lot from plant to plant (average: one and a half times per week). ProceduresinEnginePlants(ABSTRACT) MIT /IMVP [...] Oct. 1997 Page 2 - Throughout all departments of engine plants, breakdowns are caused on average mostly by mechanical problems and then by electrical problems although there is a lot of variation between plants. For those types of failures, there is no link with any downtime statistics. Hydraulic failures occur more frequently in those plants which are older. 4. Production technologies - Several of the engine plants surveyed are currently undergoing major changes. For a new engine variant, most engine plants can deal with the adaptation by using much more than half of the existing machines. In engine plants, a ?minor upgrade? can stop lines anywhere between less than 24 hours to more than a week. Currently, assembly lines in engine plants can handle more flexibility than machining lines. When different engines are built in sequence, the pattern used most often is 1 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 2 (batch sizes range from 6 to 100 ?s of engines). - Current and future design and acquisition processes for equipment do not differ. There is one policy for the whole plant. For a majority of engine plants, the methodology is as follows: the automobile company takes care of defining the requirements, it has a large influence (along with an affiliate or sister company sometimes) for the planning process, but the design and building of equipment is done by an outside equipment or system supplier. Two areas where answers differ a lot concern the system integration and the actual installation of equipment in engine plants: in some cases, the automobile company is in charge, while in other cases, an outside firm does the job. 5. Quality - Engines made in European plants have more complaints per 1000 than the North American or Japanese ones (caution: we have rather few of these data points from non-European plants). Engine quality as measured by complaints per 1000 units after engines are delivered: 3 -month quality data are quite good predictors of 12 -month data. - In almost all engine plants, Statistical Process Control (SPC) data are collected and displayed at the line or work station. Engine plants also get back some engine performance and warranty data. - In most instances, communication of engine design information is done via fax or hardcopy. Sometimes, CAD systems (mostly 2 -D) are used to exchange design dat~ however, whether CAD systems are used or not, is not a function of the age of the engine plant or of the lines. In a majority of cases, the exchange of information between the plant and the engine design department take place weekly, with actual design changes happening monthly. On average, half of the design changes are due to the engine engineering department, in order to improve the engine and to fix design or performance problems. Other causes for design changes are the meeting market needs, fixing production problems, and responding to the evolution of regulations. - All plants conduct <b>hot</b> <b>testing</b> of engines; in two facilities, only some of the engines are hottested. The test can last from 45 seconds to 18 minutes. The (few) all-aluminum engines of our survey are among those which undergo longer periods of <b>hot</b> <b>testing.</b> Less than 7 % of the engines fail the hot test the first time. By looking simultaneously at the engine quality data and at the <b>hot</b> <b>testing</b> results, we did not find any correlation: hot test duration does not uncover problems which cause quality complaints 3 or 12 months after the engines are delivered to customers. Proceduresin EnginePlants(ABSTRACT) MIT /IMVP [...] Oct. 1997 Page 3 - According toourrespondents, production technologies thatcan becritical formanufacturing high quality automotive engines concern machining operations more than the sub-assembly and final dressing ofengines; interestingly, these technologies are most often supplied by outside vendors. In addition, organizational factors are seen as much more effective than automatization, in order to produce high-quality engines. 6. Information systems - Information systems are in place in engine plants, and they are used quite extensively. - While centralized systems tend to be used mainly for planning purposes, non-centralized computer systems can help compile some statistical data and tell about equipment problems. Rarely are information systems actually used to give work assignments to employees. 7. Accounting procedures and investment decisions - For a series of recent major installations of equipment in engine plants, it took around two years between the approval of the plan and the moment when the first part was produced, and from there on, an extra three to six months for full production levels to be reached. - The top financial indicator used by car firms for measuring the "performance" of engine plants is clearly variance from budget. Some financial ratios like return on equity or return on assets are not used at all. For non-financial indicators, the quality of engines is most important, followed by safety and environment concerns, logistical issues, and labor productivity. - Product quality and internal rate of return are the two most important factors involved in engine plant investment decisions. - Most common practice is that indirect cost allocation uses standard or actual labor hours. - Activity-based costing systems were in place in 30 % of the engine plants surveyed (1995 data). 8. Plant improvement efforts - The persons surveyed do not think that more automation will be the key for progress in engine manufacturing. For the future, a strong desire is the ability to improve the flexibility of the factory, of the machines, and of the material flow. Interestingly, the respondents most interested by flexibility improvements are based in engine plants which currently deal with rather low levels of engine variety. - On the list of factors which can help improve operations in engine plants, is the need to establish better contacts with people in the engine design department and with the suppliers of machinery. Also, being able to build more engines in less space is an important goal for several respondents; actually, those most interested by this issue are from engine plants where the utilization of space is already more efficient than on average.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of River Protection’s Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) {{is being}} {{designed}} and built to pre-treat and then vitrify {{a large portion of}} the wastes in Hanford’s 177 underground waste storage tanks. The WTP consists of three primary facilities—pretreatment, low-activity waste (LAW) vitrification, and high-level waste (HLW) vitrification. The pretreatment facility will receive waste piped from the Hanford tank farms and separate it into a high-volume, low-activity liquid stream stripped of most solids and radionuclides and a much smaller volume of HLW slurry containing most of the solids and most of the radioactivity. Many of the vessels in the pretreatment facility will contain pulse jet mixers (PJM) that will provide some or all of the mixing in the vessels. Pulse jet mixer technology was selected for use in black cell regions of the WTP, where maintenance cannot be performed once <b>hot</b> <b>testing</b> and operations commence. The PJMs have no moving mechanical parts that require maintenance. The vessels with the most concentrated slurries will also be mixed with air spargers and/or steady jets in addition to the mixing provided by the PJMs. Pulse jet mixers are susceptible to overblows that can generate large hydrodynamic forces, forces that can damage mixing vessels or their internal parts. The probability of an overblow increases if a PJM does not fill completely. The purpose of the testing performed for this report was to determine how reliable and repeatable the primary and safety (or backup) PJM control systems are at detecting drive overblows (DOB) and charge vessel full (CVF) conditions. Testing was performed on the ABB 800 xA and Triconex control systems. The controllers operated an array of four PJMs installed in an approximately 13 ft diameter × 15 ft tall tank located in the high bay of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) 336 Building test facility. The PJMs were fitted with 4 inch diameter discharge nozzles representative of the nozzles to be used in the WTP. This work supplemented earlier controller tests done on PJMs with 2 inch nozzles (Bontha et al. 2007). Those earlier tests enabled the selection of appropriate pressure transmitters with associated piping and resulted in an alternate overblow detection algorithm that uses data from pressure transmitters mounted in a water flush line on the PJM airlines. Much of that earlier work was only qualitative, however, due to a data logger equipment failure that occurred during the 2007 testing. The objectives of the current work focused on providing quantitative determinations of the ability of the BNI controllers to detect DOB and CVF conditions. On both control systems, a DOB or CVF is indicated when the values of particular internal functions, called confidence values, cross predetermined thresholds. There are two types of confidence values; one based on a transformation of jet pump pair (JPP) drive and suction pressures, the other based on the pressure in the flush line. In the present testing, we collected confidence levels output from the ABB and Triconex controllers. These data were analyzed in terms of the true and noise confidence peaks generated during multiple cycles of DOB and CVF events. The distributions of peak and noise amplitudes were compared to see if thresholds could be set that would enable the detection of DOB and CVF events at high probabilities, while keeping false detections to low probabilities. Supporting data were also collected on PJM operation, including data on PJM pressures and levels, to provide direct experimental evidence of when PJMs were filling, full, driving, or overblowing...|$|E

40|$|In {{the frame}} of the {{development}} of the DIAMEX process, first studies including counter-current <b>hot</b> <b>tests</b> were performed, with the DiMethyl-DiButylTetraDecylMAlonamide as reference extractant. In parallel, the diamide formula has been optimised so that a new extractant was proposed: the DiMethylDiOctylHexylEthoxyMAlonamide. This new reference extractant was used in two inactive flowsheets. The performances obtained were satisfying and confirmed the choice of DMDOHEMA as the new reference extractant for the DIAMEX process...|$|R
40|$|This thesis reports {{theoretical}} and experimental research {{on a novel}} accelerator con-cept using a photonic bandgap (PBG) structure. Major advances in higher order mode (HOM) damping are required {{for the next generation}} of TeV linear colliders. In this work, PBG HOMs are studied theoretically and experimentally for the first time. PBG HOMs are shown in simulation to be low Q lattice modes, removed from the cavity defect and beam position. Direct wakefield measurements were made in <b>hot</b> <b>test</b> using the bunch train produced by the MIT HRC 17 GHz linear accelerator. Measurements are compared with beam-loading theory, and wakefield simulations using ANALYST. Excellent agreement is observed between theory predictions and power measured in the 17 GHz fundamental operating mode; reasonable agreement is also seen with the 34 GHz wakefield HOM. In order to understand the performance of PBG structures under realistic high gradient operation, an X-band (11. 424 GHz) PBG structure was designed for high power testing in a standing wave breakdown experiment at SLAC. The PBG structure was <b>hot</b> <b>tested</b> to gather breakdown statis...|$|R
