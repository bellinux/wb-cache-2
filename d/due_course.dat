5|$|A {{mammalian}} virus, {{the rabbit}} haemorrhagic disease virus {{was introduced to}} Australia to attempt to control the European rabbit populations there. It escaped from quarantine and spread across the country, killing large numbers of rabbits. Very young animals survived, passing immunity to their offspring in <b>due</b> <b>course</b> and eventually producing a virus-resistant population. Introduction into New Zealand in the 1990s was similarly successful at first, but a decade later, immunity had developed and populations had returned to pre-RHD levels.|$|E

5|$|An early plan {{conceived}} by British Rail {{in the early}} 1970s for a route passing through Tonbridge met considerable opposition on environmental and social grounds, especially from the Leigh Action Group and Surrey & Kent Action on Rail (SKAR).

5|$|Britten died of {{congestive}} heart failure on 4 December 1976. His funeral service was held at Aldeburgh Parish Church three days later, and he was buried in its churchyard, with a gravestone carved by Reynolds Stone. The authorities at Westminster Abbey had offered burial there, but Britten had {{made it clear that he}} wished his grave to be side by side with that, in <b>due</b> <b>course,</b> of Pears. A memorial service was held at the Abbey on 10 March 1977, at which the congregation was headed by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.|$|E

5|$|In 1912 Shaw {{invested}} £1,000 for a one-fifth {{share in}} the Webbs' new publishing venture, a socialist weekly magazine called the New Statesman, which appeared in April 1913. He became a founding director, publicist, and in <b>due</b> <b>course</b> a contributor, mostly anonymously. He was soon {{at odds with the}} magazine's editor, Clifford Sharp, who by 1916 was rejecting his contributions—"the only paper in the world that refuses to print anything by me", according to Shaw.|$|E
5|$|In <b>due</b> <b>course,</b> {{soon after}} he was {{relieved}} of his command, and as a semi-dictatorial Sanacja regime was established, Sikorski joined the anti-Piłsudski opposition. Sikorski largely withdrew from politics, spending {{much of his time}} in Paris, France, and working with the French Ecole Superieure de Guerre (war college). Even after the death of Piłsudski in 1935, he was still marginalized, politically and militarily, by Piłsudski's successors. In February next year, together with several prominent Polish politicians (Wincenty Witos, Ignacy Paderewski, and General Józef Haller) he joined the Front Morges, an anti-Sanacja political grouping.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{construction}} of a new harbour had begun, the Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal Company constructed a tramway from Llanelli to Pwll colliery. Another tramway was built from Burry Port to the coal levels at New Lodge, with a branch to Kilrhos. The company planned to link New Lodge to Pwll in <b>due</b> <b>course,</b> so that there would be a tramway link from Burry Port harbour to Llanelli; the connection was eventually opened on 8 July 1837.|$|E

5|$|The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU {{member states}} to adopt the euro upon meeting certain {{monetary}} and budgetary convergence criteria, although not all states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions, while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in <b>due</b> <b>course.</b>|$|E

To achieve this, the New Zealanders mounted several trench raids. By the time the New Zealand Division was relieved in August, it had incurred 2,500 casualties, including 375 dead.|$|E

5|$|The {{king was}} {{reluctant}} to shed blood, and this greatly irritated the ultra-reactionary Chamber of Deputies, who felt that Louis XVIII was not executing enough. The government issued a proclamation of amnesty to the “traitors” in January 1816, but the trials that had already begun were finished in <b>due</b> <b>course.</b> That same declaration also banned {{any member of the}} House of Bonaparte from owning property in, or entering, France. It is estimated that between 50,000– 80,000 officials were purged from the government during what was known as the Second White Terror.|$|E

5|$|According to the Abingdon Chronicle, Oxford Castle {{was built}} by the Norman baron Robert D'Oyly the elder from 1071–73. D'Oyly had arrived in England with William I in the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 and William the Conqueror granted him {{extensive}} lands in Oxfordshire. Oxford had been stormed in the invasion with considerable damage, and William directed D'Oyly to build a castle to dominate the town. In <b>due</b> <b>course</b> D'Oyly became the foremost landowner in Oxfordshire and was confirmed with a hereditary royal constableship for Oxford Castle. Oxford Castle is not among the 48 recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, but not every castle in existence {{at the time was}} recorded in the survey.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{clarification}} made in {{this treaty}} resulted in clarifying the anomaly of the Northwest Angle.

[...] In fact, a <b>course</b> <b>due</b> west from the Lake of the Woods never intersects the Mississippi.

5|$|After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart {{and some}} of his senior Jacobite aides had escaped to St Kilda. An {{expedition}} was launched, and in <b>due</b> <b>course</b> British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When they were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the Prince and had never heard of King George II either. Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition.|$|E
5|$|Butlin's, {{the holiday}} camp giant {{purchased}} No. 46229 Duchess of Hamilton following {{the withdrawal of}} this locomotive in February 1964 and it was put {{on display at the}} Minehead holiday camp. In 1975, following a slow deterioration due to the Minehead's salty atmosphere and the looming maintenance costs, Butlin's signed a twenty-year loan agreement for it to be taken under the wing of the National Railway Museum. In 1976, following a cosmetic overhaul, No. 46229 was put on static display in the museum's York premises. In <b>due</b> <b>course</b> a fundraising appeal allowed an overhaul to take place as a precursor to letting the locomotive operate on the national rail network once more.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{thorough}} search, the revolutionaries discovered only seven prisoners in the Bastille, rather fewer {{than had been}} anticipated. Of these, only one – de Whyte de Malleville, an elderly and white-bearded man – closely resembled the public image of a Bastille prisoner; despite being mentally ill, he was paraded through the streets, where he waved happily to the crowds. Of the remaining six liberated prisoners, four were convicted forgers who quickly vanished into the Paris streets; one was the Count de Solages, who had been imprisoned on the request of his family for sexual misdemeanours; the sixth was a man called Tavernier, who also proved to be mentally ill and, along with Whyte, was in <b>due</b> <b>course</b> reincarcerated in the Charenton asylum.|$|E
