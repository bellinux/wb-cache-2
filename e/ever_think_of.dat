25|$|Safe solo divers must be self-sufficient, well trained, {{prepared}} and practised. They {{should have a}} completely redundant set of all life support equipment (e.g. a complete, self-contained backup breathing gas supply). In addition, the responsible solo divers adhere to a very conservative dive profile, both in depth and level of difficulty. Unlike the buddy system, which encourages divers to rely on others {{in the event of}} an emergency, solo diving encourages divers to prepare themselves to overcome emergencies by their own means. The divers who engage in solo diving are typically those who are experienced and equipped enough to handle problems themselves. Solo divers must feel totally comfortable and relaxed in doing this sort of diving, and nobody should <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> doing diving solo if they are not both competent and comfortable in doing so.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} executive producers for The Sarah Jane Adventures were Phil Collinson, Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner. Susie Liggat {{produced the}} pilot, but Matthew Bouch worked as {{producer of the}} series. Co-writer Gareth Roberts, writing in Doctor Who Magazine, said, [...] "We're all determined {{that this will be}} a big, full-blooded drama; that nobody should <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as 'just' a children's programme." [...] Sue Nott was the executive producer of the second series for CBBC.|$|E
500|$|Murasaki {{probably}} {{earned an}} ambiguous nickname, [...] "The Lady of the Chronicles" [...] (Nihongi no tsubone), for teaching Shōshi Chinese literature. A lady-in-waiting who disliked Murasaki {{accused her of}} flaunting her knowledge of Chinese and began calling her [...] "The Lady of the Chronicles"—an allusion to the classic Chronicles of Japan—after an incident in which chapters from Genji were read aloud to the Emperor and his courtiers, one of whom remarked that the author showed {{a high level of}} education. Murasaki wrote in her diary, [...] "How utterly ridiculous! Would I, who hesitate to reveal my learning to my women at home, <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> doing so at court?" [...] Although the nickname was apparently meant to be disparaging, Mulhern believes Murasaki was flattered by it.|$|E

500|$|... "Some of {{the waste}} is already vitrified. There is, in my mind, no {{economical}} reason why you would <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> pulling it back into a potential fuel cycle. So one could well imagine—again, {{it depends on what}} the blue-ribbon panel says—one could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, so that means you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as salt domes. Once you put it in there, the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymore—that's good. It's a very natural containment. ...whereas there would be other waste where you say it has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} the Ethical Culture School, Marshall spent a year at Columbia University. In 1920, he {{transferred}} to the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. [...] Marshall had decided in his teens {{that he wanted to}} be a forester, writing then about his love of [...] "the woods and solitude;" [...] he wrote that he [...] "should hate to spend the greater part of my lifetime in a stuffy office or in a crowded city". For a while he was unhappy and withdrawn at Syracuse. But, he succeeded academically and was known for his individuality. As one classmate put it, Marshall was [...] "always doing something no one else would <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> doing. He was constantly rating things—the Adirondack peaks, his best days with George, and dozens of others." [...] Marshall became a member of Alpha Xi Sigma, the forestry college's honor society. He ran on the Syracuse University freshman track team and participated in both junior varsity lacrosse and cross country running. Halfway through school, Marshall had become a class leader; he was elected as class secretary and appointed an associate editor of the Empire Forester, the College's yearbook.|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, {{relations}} between Surayud and the CNS deteriorated. [...] Rumours swirled in mid-April 2007 that the CNS would overthrow the government.

I wanted an art which in the first place would appear as a representation of the impossible. (Jean Metzinger) ...|$|E
2500|$|In February–March 2000, Gelayev's forces took {{heavy losses}} as they withdrew from Grozny to the {{mountains}} of southern Chechnya, where they discovered that their mountain bases had been destroyed by Russian aircraft, leaving them starving, freezing, and low on ammunition. At that point, the notorious Chechen warlord Arbi Barayev contacted Gelayev, promising him aid and transportation to a safe area. When Gelayev's forces arrived at the specified meeting place, where buses {{were supposed to be}} waiting to evacuate their wounded, they were ambushed by a large number of Russian troops. They retreated to Gelayev's native village of Komsomolskoye (Saadi-Kotar). There, around a thousand or more rebels were trapped and the village was pounded for weeks by the federal forces in the Battle of Komsomolskoye, one of the bloodiest battles of the war, ending with hundreds of Chechen fighters and civilians dead, along with more than 50 government troops (according to Russian figures). Gelayev escaped, but with only a fraction of his men, and many of demoralized survivors decided to give up the fight. Anna Politkovskaya wrote, [...] "How could he <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> taking the war home, to Komsomolskoe, knowing in advance that his own home village would be destroyed!" ...|$|E

It is, in fact, a universalist pronouncement of the Messianic hope, and with this idea every service concludes." ...|$|R
