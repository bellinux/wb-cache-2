5|$|Pottery finds showed better finish {{compared}} to the earlier Period I. The pots were of polished black ware, mostly handmade, {{in the form of}} a dish with stand, a high-necked jar, and so forth. Also found was a wheel turned red ware pot which contained 950 beads made from carnelian and agate (inferred as items for sale), which was thought to belong to the later part of this period. A very impressive painted pottery ware recovered from this period was a globular red ware pot made on a turntable; the painting on the pot was of a wild goat of black colour with long horns and hanging ears. Another pottery item which is of interest is a polished black ware in globular shape <b>jar</b> <b>with</b> a long neck and flaring mouth.|$|E
5|$|The Garden Lobby of Althorp also {{contains}} a number of pieces of porcelain from reputable European manufacturers, but also several rare Oriental pieces. Of note in the Garden Lobby aside from its many plates is a Sèvres tobacco <b>jar</b> <b>with</b> double strap handles, believed to be painted by Louis Jean Thévenet in 1765, two Chelsea vases decorated with putti which metaphorically represent the four seasons, which the Red Earl had bought {{as a gift for}} his wife Charlotte, an extremely finely carved Meissen flower bowl with hundreds of tiny gilded blooms which dates to around 1745, a Meissen card box, and a blue and gold cherubic Meissen chocolate set-for-one which was believed to have been made for Marie Antoinette in 1781 as a present celebrating the birth of her son Dauphin.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} impact of larvaciding using a Bti (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis) formulation (VectoBac WG) against Aedes aegypti larvae in earthen jars containing aquatic plants. Aquatic plants commonly used for landscaping, Pistia stratiotes (L.) (Liliopsida: Araceae) and Sagittaria sp. (Liliopsida: Alismataceae) were placed inside earthen <b>jars</b> filled <b>with</b> 50 L tap water. All earthen <b>jars</b> were treated <b>with</b> Bti formulation at 8 g/ 1000 L. Untreated <b>jars</b> <b>with</b> and without aquatic plants were also set up as controls. Fifty laboratory-bred 2 nd instar larvae were introduced into each earthen jar. All earthen jars were observed daily. Number of adults emerged was recorded and the larval mortality was calculated. The indicators of effectiveness of Bti for these studies were (i) residual activities of Bti, and (ii) larval mortality in earthen <b>jars</b> <b>with</b> or without aquatic plants. The treated earthen jars containing P. stratiotes and Sagittaria sp. showed significant residual larvicidal effect up to 7 weeks, in comparison to untreated control (p < 0. 05). The larval mortality ranged from 77. 34 - 100 for <b>jars</b> <b>with</b> aquatic plants vs 80. 66 - 100 for jars without aquatic plant. Earthen <b>jars</b> treated <b>with</b> Bti without aquatic plants also exhibited significantly longer residual larvicidal activity of up to 10 weeks (p < 0. 05). The larval mortality ranged from 12. 66 - 100 for <b>jars</b> <b>with</b> aquatic plants vs 59. 34 — 100 for jars without aquatic plant. Thus, earthen jars without aquatic plants exhibited longer residual larvicidal effect compared to those with aquatic plants. This study suggested that containers with aquatic plants for landscaping should be treated more frequently with Bti {{in view of the}} shortened residual activity...|$|R

25|$|According {{to sources}} at the time, {{the trade in}} large native Ruson-tsukuri (literally Luzon made in Japanese: or 呂宋つくり) clay jars used for storing green tea and rice wine with Japan flourished in the 12th century, and local Tagalog, Kapampangan and Pangasinense potters had marked each <b>jar</b> <b>with</b> Baybayin letters {{denoting}} the particular urn used and the kiln the jars were manufactured in.

Of this flourishing trade, the Burnay jars of Ilocos are the only large clay jar manufactured in Luzon today with origins from this time.|$|E
25|$|Water in {{a closed}} <b>jar</b> <b>with</b> an air space over it forms a two phase system. Most of the water is in the liquid phase, where it is held by the mutual {{attraction}} of water molecules. Even at equilibrium molecules are constantly in motion and, once in a while, a molecule in the liquid phase gains enough kinetic energy {{to break away from}} the liquid phase and enter the gas phase. Likewise, {{every once in a while}} a vapor molecule collides with the liquid surface and condenses into the liquid. At equilibrium, evaporation and condensation processes exactly balance and there is no net change in the volume of either phase.|$|E

25|$|In home canning, food {{is packed}} into a jar, and the steel lid {{is placed on}} top of the <b>jar</b> <b>with</b> the {{integral}} rubber seal resting {{on the rim of the}} jar. The band is screwed loosely over the lid, which will allow air and steam to escape. By far, though, the most popular form of seal was the screw-on zinc cap, the precursor to today's screw-on lids. The earliest glass jars were called wax sealers, because they used sealing wax, which was poured into a channel around the lip that held on a tin lid. The earliest successful application of this was discovered by John Landis Mason and patented on November 30, 1858, a date embossed on millions of jars for food preservation and pickling.|$|E
