5|$|Although {{the metric}} system {{has changed and}} {{developed}} since its inception, <b>its</b> <b>basic</b> concepts have hardly changed. Designed for transnational use, it consisted of a basic set of units of measurement, now known as base units. Derived units were built up from the base units using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both base and derived units were decimal-based and identified by a standard set of prefixes.|$|E

5|$|The Osiris myth reached <b>its</b> <b>basic</b> form in {{or before}} the 24th century BCE.

5|$|With {{the end of}} the Cold War, the {{probability}} of a ground invasion of Switzerland ended, substantially changing Swiss military doctrine and resulting in reduction of both the budget {{and the size of the}} Swiss Armed Forces. In Armed Forces Reform 95, and its supporting program Defense Guidelines 95, the Air Force retained <b>its</b> <b>basic</b> structure and organization, but became a totally independent service, now called the Swiss Air Force, on 1January 1996. For the first time since its inception, subordination of the counter-air role to the ground support mission ended, and defense of domestic airspace was made its highest priority and primary task.|$|E
5|$|A popular product, {{with a lower}} screen {{resolution}} and performance than the two Retina models that followed it but a lighter build and longer battery life, it remained in the Apple line-up as an entry-level iPad model for three years until March 2014, latterly with a silent upgrade to a die-shrunk version of the A5 processor. <b>Its</b> <b>basic</b> design formed {{the core of the}} first iPad mini, which had the same screen pixel count and similar features at a smaller size.

5|$|According to Vrba, the impala {{evolved from}} an alcelaphine {{ancestor}}. She noted that while this ancestor has diverged at least 18 times into various morphologically different forms, the impala has continued in <b>its</b> <b>basic</b> form {{for at least}} five million years. Several fossil species have been discovered, including A. datoadeni from the Pliocene of Ethiopia. The oldest fossil discovered suggests its ancient ancestors were slightly smaller than the modern form, but otherwise similar in all aspects to the latter. This implies that the impala has efficiently adapted to its environment since prehistoric times. Its gregarious nature, variety in diet, positive population trend, defence against ticks and symbiotic relationship with the tick-feeding oxpeckers could {{have played a role in}} preventing major changes in morphology and behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many aspects}} of Hubbard's life story are disputed, there is general {{agreement}} about <b>its</b> <b>basic</b> outline. Born in Tilden, Nebraska, {{he spent much of}} his childhood in Helena, Montana. He traveled in Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s after his father, an officer in the United States Navy, was posted to the U.S. naval base on Guam. He attended George Washington University in Washington, D.C. {{at the start of the}} 1930s, before dropping out and beginning his career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories. He served briefly in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and was an officer in the United States Navy during World War II, briefly commanding two ships, the USS YP-422 and USS PC-815. He was removed both times when his superiors found him incapable of command. The last few months of his active service were spent in a hospital, being treated for a duodenal ulcer.|$|E
5|$|By {{the later}} seventeenth century both the Presbyterian and Episcopalian {{wings of the}} church had adopted the {{modestly}} sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation. Most had a centralised plan {{with two or three}} arms, in a rectangular or T-planned arrangement. Steeples continued to be a major feature, either centrally on the long axis, or on an end gable, as had been the case in pre-Reformation churches. As a result, there was little of the Baroque extravagance in church building seen on the continent and England. Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era. Lauder Church was built by Bruce in 1673 for the Duke of Lauderdale, who championed the bishops in the reign of Charles II. The Gothic windows may have emphasised antiquity, but <b>its</b> <b>basic</b> Greek cross plan remained within the existing common framework of new churches.|$|E

5|$|One Canadian auto {{trail was}} routed through the UP as well. In 1920, the King's International Highway linked Vancouver, British Columbia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, {{but there was}} no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior. Motorists had to ship their cars by boat between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to {{continue}} along the auto trail. The routings varied on the maps of the time, but <b>its</b> <b>basic</b> route used US2 through the UP from Ironwood to Sault Ste. Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960; by that time, the auto trail had taken on the Trans-Canada Highway name.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{seeks to}} map out how living things have changed through time. A {{substantial}} hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires very careful laboratory work, <b>its</b> <b>basic</b> principle is simple: the rates at which various radioactive elements decay are known, and so {{the ratio of the}} radioactive element to the element into which it decays shows how long ago the radioactive element was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.|$|E
5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view of {{language}} have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying <b>its</b> <b>basic</b> elements {{and then by}} presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature {{of the human mind}} and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.|$|E

5|$|The Ottawa {{writing system}} is a minor {{adaptation}} of a very similar one used for other dialects of Ojibwe in Ontario and the United States, and widely employed in reference materials and text collections. Sometimes {{referred to as the}} Double Vowel system because it uses doubled vowel symbols to represent Ottawa long vowels that are paired with corresponding short vowels, it is an adaptation attributed to Charles Fiero of the linguistically oriented system found in publications such as Leonard Bloomfieldâs Eastern Ojibwa. Letters of the English alphabet substitute for specialized phonetic symbols, in conjunction with orthographic conventions unique to Ottawa. The system embodies two basic principles: (1) alphabetic letters from the English alphabet are used to write Ottawa, but with Ottawa sound values; (2) the system is phonemic in nature, in that each letter or letter combination indicates <b>its</b> <b>basic</b> sound value, and does not reflect all the phonetic detail that occurs. Accurate pronunciation cannot be learned without consulting a fluent speaker.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic number}} system {{consists}} of a dot to represent one, and a bar to represent five. By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used. The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 {{using a combination of}} these symbols. The precise value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, <b>its</b> <b>basic</b> value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on the next level up, and two dots on the next level after that, to give 4x1, plus 4x20, plus 2x400. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers. Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.|$|E
