He became a producer of children's entertainment with the Theatre de Galafronie, Theatre Isocele and Theatre de la Guimbarde. After developing an interest in filmmaking, he enrolled at the INSAS in Brussels and later the Louis Lumière College in Paris. As a children's entertainer, childhood and innocence would become strong themes throughout his work.|$|E
5|$|Wolfgang {{prepared}} for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which {{he had learned to}} play apparently without any tuition whatsoever. As for more general preparation, the children <b>delighted</b> <b>in</b> making music together, something they never lost. On tour, even during the busiest travelling days they would fit in their daily practice, appearing to thrive on the hectic schedule. Before the journey could begin, Leopold needed the consent of his employer, the prince-archbishop. Leopold had only been appointed deputy Kapellmeister in January 1763; nevertheless the archbishop's consent to an extended leave of absence was granted, {{on the grounds that the}} Mozarts' successes would bring glory to Salzburg, its ruler, and to God.|$|E
5|$|In his lifetime, J. R. R. Tolkien {{never ceased}} to {{experiment}} on his constructed languages, {{and they were}} subjected to many revisions. Therefore, Quenya had many grammars with substantial differences between the different stages of its development. During the first conceptual stage of early Quenya c. 1910 to c. 1920, the language was called Elfin in English and Eldarissa in Qenya proper. While its development was a continuous process, Quenya underwent {{a number of major}} revisions in its grammar, mostly in conjugation and the pronominal system. The vocabulary, however, was not subject to sudden or extreme change. Tolkien sometimes changed the meaning of a word, but he almost never discarded it once invented, and he kept on refining its meaning, and countlessly forged new synonyms. Moreover, Elvish etymology was in constant flux. Tolkien <b>delighted</b> <b>in</b> inventing new etymons for his Quenya vocabulary. But after the publication of The Lord of the Rings (finished c. 1949–1950, published in 1954–1955), the grammar rules of Quenya went through very few changes and this version was then defined as late Quenya (c. 1950–1973).|$|E

5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, <b>delighted</b> <b>in</b> destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E

25|$|The {{reign of}} John II {{was taken up}} with almost {{constant}} warfare and, unlike his father who <b>delighted</b> <b>in</b> active participation in theological and doctrinal disputes, John {{appears to have been}} content to leave ecclesiastical matters to the Patriarch and the church hierarchy. Only when religion impinged directly on imperial policy, as in relations with the papacy and the possible union of the Greek and Latin churches, did John take an active part. He organised a number of disputations between Greek and Latin theologians.|$|E
25|$|He {{had made}} an early {{reputation}} for portrait medallions, before his major commissions from Charles V, whose image for posterity lies in his portraits by Titian and Leoni. Leoni was the guest of Charles in Brussels in 1549, and {{the first of the}} portraits from life dates from this time; however, Leoni had made a portrait medallion of Charles in 1536. In Brussels the Emperor installed Leoni in an apartment below his own and <b>delighted</b> <b>in</b> his company, spending hours watching him at work, Vasari recalled. He knighted Leoni on 2 November 1549.|$|E
25|$|Kazimir's father {{managed a}} sugar factory. Kazimir {{was the first}} of {{fourteen}} children, only nine of whom survived into adulthood. His family moved often and {{he spent most of his}} childhood in the villages of Ukraine, amidst sugar-beet plantations, far from centers of culture. Until age twelve he knew nothing of professional artists, although art had surrounded him in childhood. He <b>delighted</b> <b>in</b> peasant embroidery, and in decorated walls and stoves. He was able to paint in the peasant style. He studied drawing in Kiev from 1895 to 1896.|$|E
60|$|But, moreover, he saw {{everywhere}} beauty; shapes, and colours, and sounds, {{which were}} beautiful in his eyes, {{and gave him}} pleasure deep and strange, he knew not why: and the Spirit of God within him told him--'These fair things please thee. Do they not please Him who made them? He that formed the ear, shall he not hear the song of birds? He that made the eye, shall he not see the colours of the flowers? He who made thee to rejoice in {{the beauty of the}} earth, shall not he rejoice in his own works?' And God seemed to him, in his mind's eye, to <b>delight</b> <b>in</b> his own works, as a painter <b>delights</b> <b>in</b> the picture which he has drawn, as a gardener <b>delights</b> <b>in</b> the flowers which he has planted; as a cunning workman <b>delights</b> <b>in</b> the curious machine which he has invented; as a king <b>delights</b> <b>in</b> the fair parks and gardens and stately palaces which he has laid out, and builded, and adorned, for his own pleasure, {{as well as for the}} good of his subjects.|$|R

Among the 15, only Jacob, one sister and the foster sister survived into the twentieth century. Riis was influenced by his father, whose school Riis <b>delighted</b> <b>in</b> disrupting. His father persuaded him to read (and improve his English via) Charles Dickens's magazine All the Year Round and the novels of James Fenimore Cooper.|$|E
25|$|His leisure {{hours were}} devoted {{exclusively}} to literary pursuits, {{as is evident}} from the numerous allusions in his letters to the studies in which he was engaged. His friendship with Ausonius and other distinguished authors of the era proves that he <b>delighted</b> <b>in</b> associating and corresponding with the learned. His wealth must have been prodigious, for in addition to his town mansion on the Caelian Hill, and several houses in the city which he lent to his friends, he possessed upwards of a dozen villas in Italy, many detached farms, together with estates in Sicily and Mauritania.|$|E
25|$|Catherine {{believed}} in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose power depended on letters as well as arms, and she {{was familiar with the}} writing of Erasmus, among others, on the subject. She enjoyed and collected books, and moved the royal collection to the Louvre, her principal residence. She <b>delighted</b> <b>in</b> the company of learned men and women, and her court was highly literary. Her government officials, such as secretary-of-state Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy, whose wife translated the epistles of Ovid, were perfectly at home in literary circles. When she could find the time, Catherine occasionally wrote verses herself, which she would show to the court poets. Her reading was not entirely highbrow, however. A superstitious woman, she believed implicitly in astrology and soothsaying, and her reading matter included The Book of Sibyls and the almanacs of Nostradamus.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{his life}} Mark Finch was boyishly charming and often masked his private {{depression}} with public bonhomie. His gently camp affectation would occasionally dissolve into tantrum socially but such outbursts {{were not part}} of his professional life, which was characterised by lively industry, incisive wit and a passionate affability. He <b>delighted</b> <b>in</b> wordplay and inventive imagery; he never stopped writing absurd narratives, and sharp observations of his surroundings. Such commentaries were sent to friends in small packages with brief covering notes or topped and tailed with the greetings and codas of more formal letters. Soon after his birthday each year after his first arrival in London he would often create an inventive calendar collage for the coming year. Similar publications became commercial products in the mid-1990s but Finch's creations were obviously amateur and intensely personal. They were photocopied, spiral-bound and mailed to friends as pre-Christmas gifts.|$|E

Meng sent money and packages, via the Asian community in Montreal, Canada, to his family in Cambodia {{as often as he}} could throughout the 1980s; some packages either did not arrive, or arrived with some of the contents missing. In 1985, Eang gave birth to her second daughter, Victoria, and Loung entered Essex Junction High School as a freshman. A few months later, Meng and Eang were sworn in as naturalized citizens of the United States.
