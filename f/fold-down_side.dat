5000|$|The Barb {{was used}} to make money by scores of Berkeley's early hippies, denizens of [...] "The Ave" [...] (Telegraph Avenue, Berkeley, {{on the south side}} of campus), locals, runaways, and later by street people. The paper {{originally}} sold for 10 cents and later for 25 cents. Every Thursday night around 9 pm a Volkswagen truck (the one with the <b>fold-down</b> <b>sides)</b> would arrive from the printer, pulling up to Max Scherr's house on Oregon Street, which served as the paper's offices. The waiting street vendors would help unload the papers and then get in line to get their stack. The papers would be purchased at half-price or obtained for collateral. The prospective vendor who wished to obtain papers on collateral would show Scherr something of value, such as a musical instrument or a backpack containing clothing and poems. If Scherr felt the goods were valuable enough that the owner would return to get them, he would keep the collateral in exchange for a bundle of 50 papers to sell on the street. As soon as their papers were in hand vendors would hurry off to a busy intersection or their personal favorite corner, and then spend the night waiting on the curb so that no other vendor would steal their spot and they'd be able to sell their papers during the rush hour on Friday morning. The first vendor to get to The Pic coffee house was guaranteed sales of up to 25 papers. The vendor kept half of the money, so when that bundle of papers was sold, he or she would return to the office, buy back the collateral and possibly buy more papers with cash, and then return to the street corner to sell more papers. At the time the cost of living was low, so sales of Scherr's paper kept transient and homeless people afloat.|$|R
