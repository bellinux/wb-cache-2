Robbins directed and choreographed, and it was co-choreographed by Peter Gennaro, with scenery by Oliver Smith. Featured performers were George Chakiris, who won an Academy Award as Bernardo in the 1961 film version, as Riff, Marlys Watters as Maria, Don McKay as Tony, and Chita Rivera reprising her Broadway role as Anita.

2500|$|Burr is a {{lead role}} in the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton, which was written by playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda and {{inspired}} by historian Ron Chernow's 2004 biography of Hamilton. The role of Burr was originated by Leslie Odom, Jr., who won the 2016 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical {{for his work in}} the role. In Hamilton, Burr is both the main narrator of events as well as a sympathetic yet growing antagonist to Hamilton. He is portrayed as ambitious but indecisive, liking to smile and <b>gladhand</b> rather than make any strong commitment or action—something Hamilton constantly questions and calls him out on. Burr's prominent songs include [...] "Wait For It", which explains his willingness to wait for fate to decide his place and what he deserves, and [...] "The Room Where It Happens", which demonstrates his desire for more influence in decision making when he realizes waiting is not getting him where he wants to be. This puts him increasingly at odds with Hamilton, who views Burr as lacking morals or ideals and being willing to change positions for small gain. During the final duel, Burr is shown to have regret and sorrow for the duel and his role in Hamilton's death and his eventual villainous slant in history, rather than the more callous and dismissive regards records tend to show.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>gladhand</b> {{connector}} or <b>gladhand</b> coupler is an interlocking {{hose coupling}} fitted to hoses supplying pressurized air from a tractor unit to air brakes on a semi-trailer, {{or from a}} locomotive to railway air brakes on railroad cars. <b>Gladhand</b> connectors resemble a pair of [...] "hands shaking" [...] when interlocked, hence the name.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gladhands</b> are {{designed}} to allow the driver to disconnect without a mechanic or tools. They sometimes utilize a quick release style to speed up brake release time. A tractor / trailer typically has two <b>gladhands</b> - one for service brakes and another for emergency brakes. <b>Gladhands</b> are color coded. Within the United States service lines are blue and emergency brake lines are red and are standardized by SAE J318. Where ISO standards are used, the Supply lines are Red and the Control Lines are Yellow per ISO 1728. The SAE [...] "Service" [...] lines are synonymous with the ISO [...] "Supply" [...] lines and the [...] "Emergency" [...] lines are synonymous with ISO [...] "Control" [...] lines ...|$|R

He co-founded the power-pop band the <b>Gladhands,</b> which released three well-received albums in the 1990s, and continues to write, record and perform to this day. His latest band project is called The Stars Explode, formed in 2007.|$|R
50|$|A {{biography}} of the band titled Overnight Sensation - The Story of the Raspberries by Ken Sharp was released in 1993. In 1996, a tribute album to Raspberries called Raspberries Preserved was released by Pravda Records, a Chicago-based indie record label. The album featured 21 cover versions by such acts as The Rubinoos, Bill Lloyd, Brad Jones, Tiny Lights, Rank Strangers, the <b>Gladhands,</b> and The Shambles.|$|R

50|$|Mated rubber {{grommets}} provide a positive seal. Joined halves separate automatically when depressurized. <b>Gladhand</b> couplers are typically genderless or hermaphroditic, {{allowing them to}} be freely connected to each other, for example allowing either end of a railcar {{to be connected to}} the end of a train. North America has a system of standardized <b>gladhand</b> sizes.|$|E
50|$|The {{parking brake}} of the tractor unit and the {{emergency}} brake {{of the trailer}} are spring brakes that require air pressure {{in order to be}} released. They are applied when air pressure is released from the system, and disengaged when air pressure is supplied. This is a fail-safe design feature which ensures that if air pressure to either unit is lost, the vehicle will stop to a grinding halt, instead of continuing without brakes and becoming uncontrollable. The trailer controls are coupled to the tractor through two <b>gladhand</b> connectors, which provide air pressure, and an electrical cable, which provides power to the lights and any specialized features of the trailer.|$|E
5000|$|Peter Baldrachi (born February 12, 1967) is an American Boston-based singer-songwriter, drummer and guitarist. His {{style and}} sound has been {{compared}} to the likes of Paul Westerberg, The Posies, Velvet Crush, Teenage Fanclub, and Big Star. His classic pop songwriting mixes in bits and pieces of Matthew Sweet, late-era Replacements, Goats Head Soup -era Rolling Stones, and on the more obscure side, The Beatifics and The <b>Gladhands.</b> [...] He is a respected songwriter in the Power pop community, and has performed at David Bash's International Pop Overthrow, an American-originated music festival devoted to power pop music and related genres.|$|R

5000|$|Also, {{it should}} have been {{possible}} to break the <b>gladhand</b> connector coupling between the engine consist and the freight cars, decoupling them, leaving the engines alone as a runaway, and allowing the rest of the train to brake to a stop. With the train traveling at 70 miles per hour, it would have taken at least four hours to arrive at the derailment point, thus someone on a helicopter could have flown in with explosives to blow the connector, if necessary. Near the beginning of the film, where a bus is stopped at a crossing, the crossbuck is lettered [...] "Railway Crossing" [...] while the standard US crossbucks have always been lettered [...] "Railroad Crossing".

50|$|Margaret {{celebrates the}} passage of women's suffrage, but Nucky {{immediately}} pressures her to help rally new female voters in support of Republican mayoral candidate Edward Bader. She finally gives in and makes a rousing speech in favor of Bader, but sours when she sees Nucky <b>gladhanding</b> with other powerful men. Margaret also invites Richard to sit while she reads the children The Road to Oz, and later admits {{that she was a}} bit frightened herself at his disfigurement. Richard replies that because he himself has not moved past judging by appearances, he can hardly expect the same of others. He also notes to her that he sometimes forgets the changes he has undergone, and is reminded only when he looks into a mirror.|$|R
5000|$|Brake {{system is}} air-assisted-hydraulic six wheel drum brakes with a {{driveline}} parking brake, although <b>gladhands</b> {{exist on the}} rear of the vehicle for connection to trailers with full air service and emergency brakes. Braking performance of the truck is similar to other power drum brake vehicles of this size. Each drum was designed with maximum efficiency in mind, and individual drums can dissipate up to [...] of braking heat. Due to this brake system and GVWR under 26001 lb, the big deuce can be driven without a commercial driver's license in most states. Even California does NOT require a CDL to operate an M35 on public roads because even though it has three axles and an air-assisted braking system, the maximum gross weight is still under 26000 lb, making it eligible for class C on-road driving; and because the primary braking system is hydraulic, not air.|$|R
50|$|In trailers, {{this remote}} air-supply {{is in the}} form of a tank, which is charged {{whenever}} the emergency brakes are released via the red trailer-supply valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, this tank actually receives its air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs of the tractor; the air from both of these reservoirs is merged via a two-way check valve. The two-way check valve is a pneumatic device that has two inputs and one output; each input is connected to one these reservoirs. Only the air that is at the higher pressure is allowed to pass through to the check valve's output, which then passes through the tractor-protection valve, and then travels onward towards the trailer's air-tank and spring brake valve via the red trailer-supply line (a.k.a., the emergency line); this releases the trailer's emergency brakes (a.k.a. spring brakes). The tractor-protection valve is a device that prevents air from being lost from the tractor's braking system in the event of the air-lines becoming separated or broken. The tractor's air-lines connect to the trailer's air-lines via metal connectors known as <b>gladhands.</b> The merged air from both reservoirs of the tractor prevents air-loss from only one tractor braking circuit from causing the trailer's spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location, such as in the middle of an intersection.|$|R
