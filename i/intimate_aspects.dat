40|$|Oral {{narratives}} {{recounting the}} experience of childbirth are readily related by many women, despite the inherently intimate nature of the physical details of childbirth. The research literature on pregnancy, labor and delivery, postpartum, and new parenting is rife with examples of childbirth narratives, {{yet there is a}} dearth of analysis of what it is like for women to share this narrative. This study explores the questions: (a) does the telling of childbirth stories exist as a phenomenon of oral narrative that is recognizable among women who have given birth? and if so, (b) why do women tell these stories? Ten primiparous women who had medically uncomplicated, unmedicated, vaginal deliveries of healthy infants were interviewed. They were asked to relate the stories of their labors and deliveries. Using a technique termed participant-ready observation, the narratives were followed by semi-structured interviews in which {{the participants were asked to}} reflect on what it is like to tell and hear birth stories. The interviews were audio taped and transcribed. These ten women affirmed the existence of an identifiable phenomenon of oral narrative. Their stories were similar in structure, organization and character of presentation. Socio-anthropologically, the narrative is shared as a ritual which undergirds the rite of passage of childbirth. Psychologically, these women shared their stories within both close and casual relationships to compare and connect with other women, and for the stories 2 ̆ 7 entertainment value. In telling, they relived their birth experiences, dispelling disbelief that it happened. The version most often told was an 2 ̆ 2 action story 2 ̆ 2 rather than an 2 ̆ 2 affect story 2 ̆ 2. While the exchange of physical details imparts the semblance of intimacy, the genuinely <b>intimate</b> <b>aspect</b> is the intra-psychic part of the experience which is beyond words. Thus, telling birth stories helps women process the most <b>intimate</b> <b>aspect</b> of their experience while remaining psychologically shielded from public view. ...|$|R
40|$|Proof {{assistants and}} the {{programming}} languages that implement them {{need to deal}} with a range of expressions that involve bindings. Many mature proof assistants have been extended with various packages and libraries so that bindings are addressed using various techniques (e. g., de Bruijn numerals and nominal logic).

High-level and semantically elegant programming language support can be found in rather old and familiar concepts. In particular, Church’s Simple Theory of Types has long ago provided answers to how bindings interact with logical connectives and quantifiers. Similarly, the proof search interpretation of Gentzen’s proof theory provides a rich model of computation that supports bindings.

Until recently this seemed like an immutable truth in nature.

In pursuing this groundbreaking argument, the authors provide a fascinating history of developments that led to the discovery of non-locality and the sometimes heated debate between the great scientists responsible for these discoveries.

40|$|Proof {{assistants and}} the {{programming}} languages that imple-ment them {{need to deal}} with a range of linguistic expressions that involve bindings. Since most mature proof assistants do not have built-in methods to treat this aspect of syntax, they have been extended with various packages and libraries that allow them to encode such syntax using, for example, de Bruijn numerals and nominal logic features. I put forward the argument that bindings are such an <b>intimate</b> <b>aspect</b> of the structure of expressions that they should be accounted for di-rectly in the underlying programming language support for proof assistants and not as packages and libraries. One possi-ble approach to designing programming languages and proof assistants that directly supports such an approach to bindings in syntax is presented.

In particular, by combining Church’s approach to terms and formulas (found in his Sim-ple Theory of Types) and Gentzen’s approach to sequent cal-culus proofs, we can learn how bindings can declaratively interact with the full range of logical connectives and quan-tifiers. I will also illustrate how that framework provides an intimate and semantically clean treatment of computation and reasoning with syntax containing bindings.

40|$|The {{essays in}} this {{collection}} centre on the term ‘democracy’ and its place in Italian history {{over the last three}} centuries. They provide ample evidence of the complex and fluctuating patterns of emergence for the language of democracy and for types of thinking, practices and institutions that we now think of as <b>intimating</b> <b>aspects</b> of a democratic society. Although the noun has been largely missing from even the most recent books on the Risorgimento, the aspirations for democracy and republicanism were increasingly linked to Italy’s nationalist project. These essays offer English speaking audiences an extended introduction to the distinctive path of Italian democracy and an indication of the wealth of its ideas and ambitions - and the fragility of its achievements. There are different national stories of the rise of democracy to be told in Europe, but the Italian story deserves a central place in the complex task of understanding {{the ways in which the}} term was re-interpreted, contested and instantiated in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, in ways that have had lasting consequences for the modern world.

40|$|Globalization {{not only}} creates {{tremendous}} {{opportunities for the}} high-tech and high-skilled people, it also yields ample latent demand for personal service for expatriates, who frequently need to travel across national boundaries. To these highly mobile personnel, acquiring {{the language of the}} host community is increasingly perceived as one of an important key to their success in overseas assignments. It not only offers assistance in adjusting their stay overseas, but also can help them to develop a better competitive edge in business when collaborating with their local business partners and associates. As I switched from studying these expatriates to their language teachers, this study uncovers the <b>intimate</b> <b>aspect</b> of the language service that Cantonese and Putonghua teachers performed. By looking at the micro-interaction dynamic of these language teachers' works, this study examines how intimacy is possible in the social process of their service relations with the clients. Due to the marginal natures surrounding this service, the center has engendered its language service as migrant women's work with the prospect of "friend-like" service relationship. For that reason, the teachers can assist their clients to learn the language and the culture embedded in it like their friends in Hong Kong. In work,teachers need to perform emotional labor to entertain and cultivate feeling of success for their clients. As they provide their language service, which involves intense and personal interaction, teachers gradually learn to perform traditional gender roles of Caring Mother, Coquette and Confidante, which entail intimate relations emerging from the process of self-disclosure through conversation drills. Base on two and a half year of intermittent fieldwork, including participant observation and in-depth interviews, this study unveils the regime of labor intimacy these teachers perform, which often put them in situations of negotiating intimacy in their daily interaction with male clients at work. And it is intimate to the process of globalization at large. Key words: Globalization, Gender, Emotional Work Intimacy...|$|R

Conformed in its entirety with previously unseen historical footage and documents, the film reconstructs the life of the former Argentine first lady from an unbiased perspective. The film starts with meticulous examination of Evita Duarte's origins, her relationship with her parents (particularly her father) and her siblings. Evita goes on to reveal <b>intimate</b> <b>aspects</b> of Duarte's early childhood and adolescence, leading to her resolving to flee her home in the countryside for the capital city of Buenos Aires. The latter segments of the film are highlighted by interviews with former teachers from her elementary schooling in Junin, a small city in the province of Buenos Aires. Throughout the film, the director is steadily reminding the audience of the domestic and international context out of which Evita Duarte emerged, enhancing the viewer's understanding the facts.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the applicability of an instrument used to distinguish various levels of proficiency in concept formation of children at the pre-school level. This instrument as designed permits a child to distinguish a relationship in a given group of perceptual arrays and then to verbalize it. By this means the abstract notion of "conceptualizing" can be turned into an objective task. [...] The methodological constructs of the instrument were based on the conceptual process theories of Bolton, Bruner, Piaget, Polanyi, Rommetveit, Rommetveit and Kvale, and Taba. Without exception, all of these theorists hold that the ability to discern relationships in a perceptual array is an <b>intimate</b> <b>aspect</b> of initial conceptual processes. [...] Fifteen tasks were devised which allowed children to make distinctions in perceptual arrays. Each subject's responses to the tasks were tape-recorded and later transcribed. Each distinction was rated according to the three-stage conceptual process theory of Rommetveit. Responses to the 15 tasks were rated a total of four times, by the medium of Rommetveit's notion of three stages in concept formation. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test was also administered to the same children. The instrument was administered to 17 children in attendance at Memorial University Pre-School in St. John's, Newfoundland. (This was the largest available target population.) [...] Through the use of Pearson Product-Moment Coefficient Correlations, proficiency in rating the tasks using Rommetveit's three-stage concept formation theory was established. The statistics reflected a high correlation between the ratings of the task responses. Further, by the mechanics of Pearson Product-Moment Coefficients and factor analysis, a relationship was established between tested proficiency of the child and proficiency in the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. The results indicated that the instrument clearly showed the emergence of two orthogonal dimensions. In light of the immediate data, neither of these dimensions apparently relates to the Peabody. [...] It is suggested that further research be conducted to identify more specifically the dimensions in the designed instrument...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} an anthropological and historical study of transformations of labour regimes in Macedonia {{within the context}} of a changing political economy. This process can largely be situated in the “transition” from a socialist to a market-based economic model; a process which was never only about transforming the “economic” but touched upon every <b>intimate</b> <b>aspect</b> of people’s lives. It is through these changes, and the reconceptualization of what work ought to be about, that we can explore larger questions of class identity, alienation, morality, personhood and the operations of power and social reproduction in contemporary Macedonian society. As such, this thesis is offered as a contribution to the traditional, yet, in the case of Macedonia, under-researched, themes of social and economic anthropology. My primary fieldsite and object of investigation, is the small township of Shtip, in eastern Macedonia, where I investigate the changing role and social status of industrial workers in the national economy, and the everyday working lives of garment labourers in one of Shtip’s largest garment factories. The historical chapters of this thesis analyse the making of an industrial working class within socialist Yugoslavia, and the subsequent attempts at unmaking the values, social relations and forms of personhood, that grew up within the specifics of Yugoslav socialism. I approach “class” through the indeterminate interplay of social, cultural and economic factors, and highlight the enduring cultural importance of embedded, relational forms of personhood. As I move towards more current events, and particularly the ethnographic chapters, I focus more strongly on the responses of industrial workers to such changes. I deal not only with specific practices, but also with questions of the “imagination”, or how workers, experience, and reflect on these wider changes in ways that keep open the possibility of rearranging social relations at the work place, and beyond. In doing do, I propose that struggles over the definition of personhood, rather than class conflict, are at the forefront of debates about what work ought to be about. Also, I suggest that the outcome of these struggles has not been to challenge subordination and social inequality in itself, but to challenge the specific kinds of inequality and subject categories introduced by the transition to a neoliberal market economy (Dunn 2004) ...|$|R
40|$|Vaginal {{examination}} is {{a common}} and routine aspect of midwifery practice that is used to. determine the presentation and position of the fetus and to measure cervical dilatation {{in order to assess}} progress in labour. It is known that the procedure may be problematic. The available literature focuses on the accuracy or otherwise of estimates of cervical dilatation and the potential for vaginal examination to result in post-traumatic stress disorder, particularly for women who have experienced sexual abuse. However, no research has previously been undertaken to explore midwives' accounts of the procedure. This PhD uses the work of Foucault, in particular his writing on surveillance, to identify midwives' discourses on vaginal examination and to explore these within the context of knowledge and power. Qualitative research methods and a methodology of critical ethnography were used to identify the discourses, underpinned by postmodern and feminist principles. In total, sixteen midwives and ten pregnant women were recruited to the study and data were analysed thematically using ethnographic principles. The findings from this PhD confirm that vaginal examination is problematic. In addition, the research demonstrates that midwives experience vaginal examination as a form of surveillance and modify and monitor their behaviour in response to this scrutiny. Midwives described the punitive nature of this surveillance and, in response, hid and obfuscated some of their behaviour. The implications of practitioners acting in this way are profound for both midwives and the women in their care. Further work is needed to explore how the culture of the maternity services can be improved to support more transparent and open practice. The findings demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of knowledge within the context of vaginal examination and raise important issues for policy and practice {{about the ways in which}} midwives use this knowledge, particularly in relation to recording their clinical findings. Midwives in this study stated that during their training they did not feel equipped for the physical and emotional realities of vaginal examination. Further research is needed to improve the preparation of students for this particularly <b>intimate</b> <b>aspect</b> of body work. Finally, this study demonstrates that midwives exert a form of power that can best be described as matriarchal. This concept has not previously been identified in the midwifery literature and is worthy of further exploration. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
