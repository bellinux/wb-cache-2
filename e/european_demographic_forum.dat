40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effects of}} the landowning and land reforms on economic and demographic growth by a family-optimization model with endogenous fertility and status-seeking. A land reform provides the peasant with strong incentives to limit their family size and to improve the productivity of the land. Even though the income effect due to the land reform tends to raise fertility, a strong enough status-effect outweighs it, thus generating a decrease in population growth. The <b>European</b> <b>demographic</b> history provides supporting anecdotal evidence for this theoretical result...|$|R
30|$|Immigration is not {{a popular}} issue with the average European (Zimmermann 1995). Nonetheless, the EU needs to {{continue}} to view immigration from outside the EU for its potential to reduce the emerging shortages of well-trained people, {{in view of the}} development of <b>European</b> <b>demographics</b> (Zimmermann 2005). At the same time the EU needs to deal with the pressure for immigration into the EU which now mostly evolves through asylum seeking and refugee admission policy, aside from family reunion. Additionally, significant resources have been mobilized to fight human smuggling and trafficking networks in the EU.|$|R
50|$|Combined {{with the}} <b>European</b> <b>demographic</b> crisis, this {{resulted}} in the immigration of about 5 million people, mostly European peasants, {{in the last quarter}} of the 19th century and first half of the 20th. The majority of these immigrants were either Portuguese or Italian (about 1,500,000 each), though significant numbers of Spaniards - which possibly include Portuguese emigrating from Vigo on false passports - (690,000), Germans (250,000), Japanese (170,000), Middle Easterns (100,000, mostly people from what are now Syria and Lebanon arriving on Turkish passports), and Eastern Europeans (mostly Poles and Ukrainians arriving on Russian passports) also immigrated.|$|R
40|$|In this document, we {{consider}} {{the effects of a}} land reform on economic and demographic growth by a family-optimization model with sharecropping, endogenous fertility and status seeking. We show that tenant farming is the major obstacle to escaping the Malthusian trap with high fertility and low productivity. A land reform provides peasant families higher returns for their investments in land, encouraging them to increase their productivity of land rather than their family size. This decreases fertility and increases productivity in agriculture in the short and long runs. The <b>European</b> <b>demographic</b> history provides supporting evidence for this...|$|R

5000|$|Heinsohn has {{discussed}} {{the origin of}} modern <b>European</b> <b>demographic</b> patterns (starting with an intense increase in population growth in early modern times, leading to sub-replacement fertility {{at the dawn of}} the 21st century), including an interpretation of the European witch hunts of early modern times as pro-natalist re-population policy of the then dominant Catholic Church after the population losses the black death had caused. [...] This interpretation has received mixed responses.

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} European family {{dynamics}} are often linked to common latent trends {{of economic and}} ideational change. Using Bayesian factor analysis, we extract three latent variables from eight socio-demographic indicators related to family formation, dissolution, and gender system and collected on 19 European countries within four periods (1970, 1980, 1990, 1998). The flexibility of the Bayesian approach allows us to introduce an innovative temporal factor model, adding the temporal dimension to the traditional factorial analysis. The underlying structure of the Bayesian factor model proposed reflects our idea of an autoregressive pattern in the latent variables relative to adjacent time periods. The results we obtain are consistent with current interpretations in <b>European</b> <b>demographic</b> trends...|$|R
40|$|In Europe, {{the trend}} towards greater life expectancy, often in good health, is {{primarily}} due to the unprecedented peace we have known for 60 years, the constant improvement in living conditions and the progress in medicine enabling us to live longer. This success partly explains the demographic perspective facing Europe of an ageing population with rising old age dependency ratios. Initially, discussion around this ageing trend concentrated on the sustainability of social security, pensions and health policies. However, it is increasingly recognized that an ageing population will require the adaptation of practically all major public policies, including education, employment and social affairs, transport, public services and infrastructures and urban planning, to address ageing and exploit the opportunities it presents. <b>European</b> <b>demographic</b> trends, cohesion policy...|$|R

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} major recent {{findings on}} Chinese demographic behavior and outlines their relevancy for the Malthusian model of comparative population dynamics and Chinese population in particular. Specifically, it considers four distinctive and persistent features of Chinese behavior {{during the last}} 300 years-high rates of female infanticide and abortion, high rates of bachelorhood, low marital fertility, and high rates {{of male and female}} adoption-and discusses the origins and implications of such a demographic regime for Chinese economic and social development. Contrasting Chinese <b>demographic</b> behavior with <b>European</b> <b>demographic</b> behavior, the article argues the existence of a demographic system and a demographic transition different from current Malthusian and neo-Malthusian models, and the existence of a system regulating collective demographic behavior in ways distinctly different from Western experience.

40|$|As MOOCs grow in popularity, the {{relatively}} low completion rates of learners has been a central criticism. This focus on completion rates, however, reflects a monolithic view of disengagement that does not allow MOOC designers to target interventions or develop adaptive course features for particular subpopulations of learners. To address this, we present a simple, scalable, and informative classification method that identifies {{a small number of}} longitudinal engagement trajectories in MOOCs. Learners are classified based on their patterns of interaction with video lectures and assessments, the primary features of most MOOCs to date. In an analysis of three computer science MOOCs, the classifier consistently identifies four prototypical trajectories of engagement. The most notable of these is the learners who stay engaged through the course without taking assessments. These trajectories are also a useful framework for the comparison of learner engagement between different course structures or instructional approaches. We compare learners in each trajectory and course across <b>demographics,</b> <b>forum</b> participation, video access, and reports of overall experience. These results inform a discussion of future interventions, research, and design directions for MOOCs. Potential improvements to the classification mechanism are also discussed, including the introduction of more fine-grained analytics...|$|R
40|$|Coital {{frequency}} is at {{the heart}} of the debate over low marital fertility in pretransition China. This study argues that coital frequency in contemporary China is indicative of sexual behavior in an earlier era. Frequency of intercourse is low in China relative to Europe, a natural outgrowth of a traditional family system and related sexual culture only partially transformed by a century of family revolution. Customary sexual behaviors and breastfeeding practices together shaped the Chinese historical fertility regime as they did the European. As explanations for China's low marital fertility, these proximate determinants leave little scope for the operation of fecundity-reducing malnutrition on the one hand, or deliberate fertility control on the other. The fertility regimes of other pretransition agrarian societies more closely resemble China's than Europe's, seeming to confirm a pattern of <b>European</b> <b>demographic</b> exceptionalism.

50|$|The {{restrictions}} by the Canadian government increased on Indians, as {{policies were}} put in place in 1907 to prevent Indians who had the right to vote from voting in future general elections. Furthermore, government quotas were established to cap the number of Indians allowed to immigrate to Canada in the early 20th century. This was part of a policy adopted by Canada to ensure that the country retained its primarily <b>European</b> <b>demographic,</b> and was similar to American and Australian immigration policies at the time. These quotas only allowed fewer than 100 people from India a year until 1957, when it was marginally increased (to 300 people a year). In comparison to the quotas established for Indians, people from Europe immigrated freely without quotas in large numbers during that time to Canada, numbering {{in the tens of thousands}} yearly.|$|R
50|$|This {{approach}} {{has been used to}} infer demographic and selection models for many species, including humans. For example, Marth et al. (2004) used the single population allele frequency spectra for a group of Africans, Europeans, and Asians to show that population bottlenecks have occurred in the Asian and <b>European</b> <b>demographic</b> histories, but not in the Africans. More recently, Gutenkunst et al. (2009) used the joint allele frequency spectrum for these same three populations to infer the time at which the populations diverged and the amount of subsequent ongoing migration between them (see out of Africa hypothesis). Additionally, these methods may be used to estimate patterns of selection from allele frequency data. For example, Boyko et al. (2008) inferred the distribution of fitness effects for newly arising mutations using human polymorphism data that controlled for the effects of non-equilibrium demography.|$|R

50|$|Following the {{discovery}} of America and the colonial expansion in the Caribbean and Continental America, valuable agricultural products and mineral resources were introduced into Spain through regular trade routes. New products such as potatoes, tomatoes and corn had a long-lasting impact on the Spanish economy, but more importantly on <b>European</b> <b>demographics.</b> Gold and silver bullion from American mines were used by the Spanish Crown to pay for troops in the Netherlands and Italy, to maintain the emperor's forces in Germany and ships at sea, and to satisfy increasing consumer demand at home. However, the large volumes of precious metals from America led to inflation, which had {{a negative effect on}} the poorer part of the population, as goods became overpriced. This also hampered exports, as expensive goods could not compete in international markets. Moreover, the large cash inflows from silver hinder the industrial development in Spain as entrepreneurship seems to be dispensable.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{changes in the}} size and the {{composition}} of the labour force in ve OECD countries from 1983 through 2000. We apply a recent decomposition method to quantify the components of the change over time in the crude labour force rate and {{the mean age of the}} labour force. Our results show that the change in the crude labour force rate was dominated by the change in age-specic labour force participation rates. For the mean age of the labour force we nd that for males the change in the age composition of the population predominately explains the overall change while the results for females are less clear-cut. <b>European</b> <b>Demographic</b> Research Papers are working papers that deal with allEuropean issues or with issues that are important to a large number of European Countries.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} micro-level interrelationships between the {{educational}} trajectories {{of women and}} the transition to motherhood. We disentangle the impact of events in one trajectory on events in the other trajectory, from common factors such as aspirations and orientations that simultaneously affect both trajectories. We argue that macro-level institutional and factors are the key ones shaping this interrelationship. To shed light on the empirical relevance of macro-level factors, we adopt an international comparative approach. We apply simultaneous hazard models to individual-level data from Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS) in 11 Western European countries. We find important international differences in micro-level relationships: the mutual influence and the importance of common factors for both processes are weaker where welfare regimes, and in particular social policies that allow role combinations, are stronger. _____________________________________________________________ <b>European</b> <b>Demographic</b> Research Papers are working papers that deal with all-European issues or with issues that are important to a large number of countries.

We sequenced 1580 bp in the coding region informative for subclassification of haplogroup H, the most poorly resolved European haplogroup when studying only control-region variation. This revealed nine coding polymorphisms (at positions 3010, 3915, 3992, 4024, 4336, 4745, 4769, 4793 and 6776, besides the diagnostic position 7028) that allowed subclassification of around 80 % of the 306 Iberian H samples in eight subhaplogroups. Frequencies for these haplogroups vary widely, {{with half of the}} samples sharing the substitution at position 3010 (but some structure is already apparent within this subhaplogroup). The HVRI diversity suggested the following age estimates for some subhaplogroups: 3010 : 13, 400 ± 3000 years; 6776 : 8600 ± 2800 years; 4336 : 4700 ± 2700 years; 3915 : 17, 300 ± 9100 years.

40|$|Officially, huge {{importance}} {{was attached}} to the family in twentieth century Ireland, the most obvious manifestation of this is in the Constitution of 1937 where it is afforded the status of a moral institution with inalienable and imprescriptible rights. In practice however, there was a huge gulf between the ideals and the reality. In this marvellous book, Finola Kennedy has shown that ultimately, the ideal constitutional notion of the family, particularly {{towards the end of the}} century, could not remain above and beyond economic realities. This book is one of the most significant to have been published on modern Irish history because despite its place at the centre of Irish life and official rhetoric, there has been little sustained examination of the family as an institution. This is all the more surprising, given the author?s contention that change in the various dimensions of Irish family life amounted to a social revolution within an economic revolution, as Ireland, for so long the exception to normal <b>European</b> <b>demographic</b> trends, began to mirror the trends of its European neighbours...|$|R
40|$|Chronometric {{attention}} in the Late Glacial of Western Europe is turning from the dating of archaeological cultures to studying how the continent was re-populated {{at the end of}} the last ice age. We present results from a survey of all available radiocarbon determinations (the S 2 AGES database) which show that when calibrated, and compared to the GRIP stratotype of climatic events, the data can be interpreted as five population events in the 15 ka prior to the onset of the Holocene. The fine-grained climate record provides an opportunity to study the impact of environmental factors on a human dispersal process that not only shaped subsequent European prehistory, but also the genetic makeup of modern Europeans. The population events have implications for archaeologists and molecular geneticists concerning the timing, direction, speed and scale of processes in Western <b>European</b> <b>demographic</b> history. The results also bear on the role of climatic forcing on the expansion and contraction of human populations and in particular the correlation of ice core and terrestrial records for the onset of warming in the North Atlantic...|$|R
40|$|Every day several {{thousand}} {{of people are}} trafficked in different countries in searching better life. Modern day slavery, trafficking in human beings, presents a grave human rights violation. This is the problem, which covers social, political, and demographic aspects, as well as gender and ethnic stratification, transnational organized crime and human rights abuses, and the facility of states and supranational institutions effectively {{to deal with those}} issues. It seems that one of the core causes of trafficking in persons is poverty related to the inequalities between economically developed countries and less developed ones. This main factor pushes people to migrate to different countries, as they have no other options to feed their families. In tandem, pull factors such as <b>European</b> <b>demographic</b> problems ensure continuing demand. Consequently, individual nations’ efforts cannot succeed unless global efforts are harmonized and these push and pull factors are addressed.

40|$|Human {{populations have}} {{experienced}} dramatic growth since the Neolithic revolution. Recent studies that sequenced {{a very large}} number of individuals observed an extreme excess of rare variants, and provided clear evidence of recent rapid growth in effective population size, though estimates have varied greatly among studies. All these studies were based on protein-coding genes, in which variants are also impacted by natural selection. In this study, we introduce targeted sequencing data for studying recent human history with minimal confounding by natural selection. We sequenced loci very far from genes that meet a wide array of additional criteria such that mutations in these loci are putatively neutral. As population structure also skews allele frequencies, we sequenced a sample of relatively homogeneous ancestry by first analyzing the population structure of 9, 716 European Americans. We employed very high coverage sequencing to reliably call rare variants, and fit an extensive array of models of recent <b>European</b> <b>demographic</b> history to the site frequency spectrum. The best-fit model estimates ~ 3. 4 % growth per generation during the last ~ 140 generations, resulting in a population size increase of two orders of magnitude. This model fits the data very well, largely due to our observation that assumptions of more ancient demography can impact estimates of recent growth. This observation and results also shed light on the discrepancy in demographic estimates among recent studies...|$|R
