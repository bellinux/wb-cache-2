500|$|Iyall was {{observed}} by Mother Jones {{to be among}} {{a new group of}} female fronted rock bands that displayed a [...] "tough, wry, street-wise, [...] cynical" [...] attitude and sought to redefine {{the role of women in}} rock music. She developed a sizable following for her writing that covered topics like [...] "frustrated desire [...] sexually motivated rage" [...] from a female perspective. Critics praised her lyrics for their [...] "searing imagery", [...] "seething poetics", and [...] "" [...] "My approach was always that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to say, I had a point of view," [...] Iyall said, commenting on her outspokeness. [...] "I remember seeing Penelope from the Avengers at the Mabuhay Gardens and thinking, I can do that. I have something to say." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Now {{that that}} show is just humming and doing amazing {{business}} — it’s the #1 bestselling magic {{show in the}} world as far as ticket sales and the perception that people are experiencing and coming back to see it multiple times — I felt it was in a great place and I could think about television again. Obviously, “Believe” will continue to evolve until its last performance because I always want to add new magic, I’m always tweaking and transforming it. I missed being on television, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> new creatively to say, and Spike became the perfect home to do it." [...] Endemol purchased the foreign distribution rights for the show, and was the [...] "most-watched new original series [...] in more than 18 months" [...] according to The Hollywood Reporter.|$|E

500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was glad <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> in reserve.|$|E
500|$|Milian {{wrote the}} hip-hop ballad [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] about [...] "thinking that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> good, {{what happens when}} it's over, and going forward with my life." [...] The track {{was one of the}} final songs that Milian wrote about the {{break-up}} as it [...] "helped me get it all out". While the record is about a break-up, it focuses more on closure and moving past it. Milian and Cool & Dre used the melody of the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony song [...] "Tha Crossroads" [...] and changed the lyrics [...] "and I'm gonna miss everybody" [...] to [...] "and I'm gonna tell everybody". The other song, [...] "Who's Gonna Ride", has a more street and gangster vibe, and contain more raw lyrics. Milian wrote the track with Dre, which she said helped because hip hop artists write about real things in their lives and are not afraid to say anything. While writing the track, Milian let her guard down and wrote what she was feeling and tried to be real. Lyrically, the song also deals with [...] "the girls that come around and try to take your man. Or the groupie girls that are around, paying attention to the guys on TV that only hang out with them for those reasons." [...] Milian also said [...] "Who's Gonna Ride" [...] was the hardest song to write because it was not safe, unlike previous songs she had written. The singer explained writing the lyrics was not hard, but the difficulty came from being real and actually writing about her true feelings. When writing the lyrics, Milian removed several lines that she thought were too harsh.|$|E
2500|$|Shindo is most {{remembered for}} the albums he {{recorded}} featuring {{a mix of}} eastern and western musical styles and instrumentation. [...] Jazz composer and critic Leonard Feather named Shindo as a [...] "Giant of Jazz" [...] in the fifteenth article in Feather's series on the [...] "giants of jazz." [...] His albums won favor with listeners of music in the exotica genre that also included artists Martin Denny, Les Baxter and Arthur Lyman. [...] The popularity of exotica peaked in 1959 as Denny's album [...] "Exotica" [...] spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart and was the No. 3 {{album of the year}} according to Billboard. Shindo later recalled what attracted him to the style: [...] "Everyone is looking for a style. So in my case, I decided being Oriental, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> I should draw upon and so I decided to go 'exotic sound.'" ...|$|E
