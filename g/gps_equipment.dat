40|$|The {{analysis}} of specific factors affecting in vitro gas production (GP; ml/g DM), methane (CH(4); ml/g DM), and CH(4) /GP {{was carried out}} by a meta-analysis approach using 274 results from 39 papers published over 12 years. Only feeds or diets incubated without additives were considered. The common factors accounted were: the pressure in the <b>GP</b> <b>equipment</b> used (PR; constant or increasing), the incubation time (IT; 24 or ≥ 48 h), the collection of rumen fluid (CRF; from fasted or fed animals), the donor species (DS; sheep or cattle), and the nitrogen (N) in the buffer solution (presence or absence). In addition to these dichotomous factors (0 or 1), the NDF content (g/kg), the rumen fluid/buffer ratio (ml/ml), the rumen fluid/feed sample ratio (ml/g DM), the buffer/feed sample ratio (ml/g DM), and the buffered rumen fluid/feed sample ratio (BRF/FS, ml/g DM) were considered. However, with the exception of NDF (391. 6 ± 175. 3 g/kg), only the BRF/FS (129. 7 ± 61. 4 ml/g DM) was considered as potential factor to be accounted after a preliminary analysis, being the most important source of variation. A final stepwise analysis was carried out using the 5 dichotomous factors, NDF and BRF/FS contents to assess the relative magnitude of each factor on GP, CH(4) and CH(4) /GP. The most relevant factors analysed were NDF and IT for GP and CH(4) (sum of partial R^ 2 of 0. 44 and 0. 35, resp.), followed by CRF and BRF/FS (sum of partial R^ 2 of 0. 06 and 0. 09, resp.). The increasing PR was the fifth factor entering the model (partial R 2 of 0. 01), but affected only CH(4). The relative magnitude of factors affecting the GP/CH(4) was in order: CRF, BRF/FS, PR, and IT (R 2 = 0. 18). The analysis carried out showed that DS and N in the buffer did not influence the analysed variables. As expected, the increase of IT and the reduction of NDF enhanced the GP and CH(4). Looking at methodological factors, rumen fluid from fed animals showed greater GP and CH(4) (+ 37. 7 and + 10. 6 ml/g DM, resp.) than using fluid from fasted animals. For a unit increase in BRF/FS (ml/g DM), a corresponding increase of 0. 32 and 0. 14 ml/g DM in GP and CH(4), resp., was observed. The increasing PR enhances CH(4) production of 4. 5 ml/g DM, as compared to constant PR in the <b>GP</b> <b>equipment.</b> Results of this meta-analysis suggest that a strong standardization of methodological procedures (accumulation of gas at constant or increasing PR, CRF, IT, and BRF/FS) is needed to compare results of different trials. needed to compare results of different trials...|$|R

25|$|These {{manufacturers}} offer special {{models for}} fishing {{that are designed}} and accessorized for this sport, including specially designed hatches, built-in coolers & rod holders, <b>gps</b> receivers and <b>equipment</b> mounts. Other accessories include live wells, anchor trolleys and running lights. Specially designed fishing kayaks usually have designs {{similar to those of}} recreational sit-in and sit-on-top kayaks characterized by very wide beams (up to 36 inches) that increase lateral stability. The increases stability allows for the angler to stand up and fish on the kayak. These kayaks provide a considerable space for storage inside their hulls which allow the angler to stow rods, fishing gear, batteries for fish finders, extra paddles, anchors, and wheels to tow the kayak from vehicle to the water. The cutouts molded into the top of the kayaks are well-suited to hold milk crates with additional supplies. Some anglers equip their fishing kayaks with outriggers to further increase stability. In recent years people have begun using kayaks for fly fishing, most models suited for upright fly casting include upright braces that allow you to safely stand up.|$|R

40|$|Purpose:  Rigid gas {{permeable}} (GP) {{contact lenses}} {{may provide the}} safest option for lens wear, but prescribing rates are in decline. This study investigated the effect of practitioner attitudes on GP lens prescribing. Methods:  A questionnaire was developed using a focus group and a pilot study. Questions addressed clinical time spent fitting <b>GP</b> lenses, specialist <b>equipment</b> requirements and perceived safety and comfort. With ethical approval, the questionnaire was sent to 1000 randomly selected UK registered eye care practitioners (ECPs). Results:  In general, ECPs enjoy the challenge of fitting GPs, although fitting takes longer than soft lens fitting. There is a difference in attitude between longer qualified and more recently qualified ECPs. Longer qualified ECPs more frequently reported enjoyment of the fitting challenges, recommended GP lenses to patients and {{were less likely to}} believe that GP lenses were becoming obsolete. ECPs are in strong agreement on the ocular health advantages of fitting GPs. They do not feel specialist equipment is generally needed, although some reported a topographer to be advantageous. The large majority of ECPs {{do not have access to}} the specialist equipment they perceive to be normally associated with GP fitting (radiuscope, V-gauge). They believe that initial fitting discomfort of GP fitting is a major drawback to their fitting, and while they feel this greatly improves with adaptation, they do not feel it reaches soft lens wear comfort.
