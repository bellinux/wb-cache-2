40|$|Presented at The Oregon Water Conference, May 24 - 25, 2011, Corvallis, OR. Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) {{aquifers}} {{are commonly}} {{thought to be}} relatively flat lying, laterally extensive, and mostly confined, and therefore {{not likely to be}} directly connected to surface water. However, many of the CRBG units in south-central Washington and north-central Oregon were deposited within evolving synclinal structures of the Yakima Fold Belt. The synclines hosted drainage systems that interacted with the encroaching lava flows, resulting in enhanced porosity and permeability where the flows encountered water or wet sediment. The geometry of the synclines also constrained the lateral extents of the lava flows. Modern streams within the synclines have exposed some of the permeable flow contacts and locally allowed connectivity between the streams and aquifers. Where the elevation of the hydraulic head in the aquifer is above the elevation of the exposed contact, the aquifer typically discharges to the stream. Historically, this was the case in Mosier Creek. In confined (S= 10 - 4 – 10 - 5) and syncline-controlled ground-water flow systems like that near Mosier, seasonal and long-term changes in hydraulic head in aquifers can propagate rapidly to stream/aquifer boundaries. For example, as hydraulic head in the Mosier groundwater flow system declined over 150 feet in the last 4 decades, Mosier Creek has gone from a <b>gaining</b> <b>stream</b> to a losing stream {{in the vicinity of the}} exposed contacts. The exposed contacts in Mosier Creek represent head-dependent boundaries to the Mosier groundwater flow system. Hydraulic head decline in the Mosier area is due to depressurization of aquifers by interaquifer flow through uncased sections of wells, and overdraft conditions in one of the aquifers. But regardless of the decline mechanism, any head decline in a CRBG aquifer connected to a <b>gaining</b> <b>stream</b> will result in diminished streamflow...|$|E

This paper presents a math-ematical implementation of this concept as well as the model assumptions. We also present an analytical solution, which provides a physical basis for the commonly used power-law flow-load equation.

40|$|International audienceA methodological {{framework}} is proposed for designing a multi-scale sampling system {{to quantify the}} stream-aquifer interactions in a multi-layer aquifer system. First, geophysical and drilling investigations are performed to assess the regional structure of the aquifer system and the local connectivity between streams and aquifer units. At the catchment scale, the investigations permit to define {{the composition of the}} upper aquifer unit. At the local scale, the connectivity status between streams and aquifer units is evaluated using various settings for electrical resistivity tomographies. These geophysical investigations are then used to select local monitoring stations (LMSs) along the stream network. Moreover, piezometric head maps representative of low and high flow regimes are interpolated using geostatistics, which provides distributions of both piezometric heads and standard deviations of the estimation error (STEE). The map of STEE is used to define the location of new piezometers. Altogether, the sampling system allows for monitoring water exchanges on a 40 km 2 watershed along 6 km of the stream network, with a finer hydro-geophysical sampling at each LMS. Finally, temperature profiles in the HZ are interpreted with a coupled thermo-hydro finite element code at the upstream station of the domain.

To understand the role of sediment particle size on thermal profiles within the hyporheic zone, a statistical approach, involving general summary statistics and time series cross-correlation, was employed. Data were collected along two riffles: Site 1 : gravel (d 50 = 3. 9 mm) and Site 2 : sand (d 50 = 0. 94 mm). Temperature probe grids collected 15 -minute temperature data at 30, 60, 90, and 140 cm below the streambed surface over a 6 month period. Surface water and air temperature were recorded. Diel temperature signal penetration depth {{was limited to the}} upper 30 cm of the streambed and was driven by advection. Surface seasonal trends were detected at greater depths, indicating that thermal pulses are transmitted initially by advection and by conduction to areas deeper in the hyporheic zone. Site 1 showed a high degree of thermal heterogeneity via a localized downwel ling zone within a <b>gaining</b> <b>stream</b> environment. Site 2 exhibited a vertically and horizontally homogenized thermal en vironment attributed to an increased amount of sand sediments that limited advection and significant groundwater dis charge that mediated the effects of downwelling surface water. </span...|$|E

A channelized (Fletcher Swamp) and an unchannelized (Spencer Swamp) sub-basin were examined. During wet periods, the Fletcher Swamp displayed a consistent {{interaction between the}} wetland and stream, resulting in a <b>gaining</b> <b>stream,</b> maintaining a lateral hydrological connection and yielding high runoff ratios. When dry periods dominated, water tables dropped low enough in the Fletcher Swamp such that water moved from the stream channel into the underlying substrate, creating a lateral hydrological disconnection between the stream and wetland. This disconnection reduced runoff ratios during storm events. The Spencer Swamp, with no well-defined stream channel, relied on overland flow and a longitudinal hydrological connection to deliver water to the sub-basin outflow. This connection was maintained in the wet season (2000) but ceased in the dry season (2001) despite consistent inputs from an upstream reservoir.

The objective {{of this study was}} to understand how changes in flow regime, hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical conditions affect the ecological conditions for hyporheic fauna and stream ecosystem function. The Maules Creek catchment in northern NSW supports a rich hyporheic fauna (hyporheos) including numerous species of stygofauna. The streams exhibit flow regimes ranging from intermittent to perennial, and interactions with groundwater that include stream ‘gaining’ and stream ‘losing’ conditions. As hypothesised, losing stream conditions supported few stygofauna and rapidly became hypoxic / anoxic as down-welling organic matter (OM) was oxidised in the hyporheic zone. In contrast, <b>gaining</b> <b>stream</b> conditions supported a rich hyporheos where upwelling oxygenated groundwater low in OM mixed with stream hyporheic water high in OM and nutrients. The stream with a highly intermittent flow regime supported a rich hyporheos indicating that non-perenniality cannot be used as an argument to diminish the ecosystem services potential of intermittent streams which are typical of many Australian catchments. Small changes in aquifer pressure or groundwater levels may switch conditions from gaining to losing and thus change the ecological conditions for hyporheic fauna and stream ecosystem function.

Simulations of sea-level rise of 2. 65 mm/year from 1929 to 2050 resulted in an increase in water levels relative to a fixed datum, yet a net decrease in water levels relative to the increased sea-level position. The net decrease in water levels was much greater near a <b>gaining</b> <b>stream</b> than farther from the stream. The difference in the change in water levels is attributed to the dampening effect of the stream on water level changes in response to sea-level rise. In response to the decreased water level altitudes relative to local sea level, the depth to the fresh water/salt water interface decreased. This reduction in the thickness of the fresh water lens varied throughout the aquifer and was greatly affected by proximity to a ground water fed stream and whether the stream was tidally influenced. Away from the stream, the thickness of the fresh water lens decreased by about 2 % from 1929 to 2050, whereas the fresh water lens thickness decreased by about 22 % to 31 % for the same period near the stream, depending on whether the stream was tidally influenced.

40|$|In gaining streams, {{groundwater}} seeps {{out into}} streams. In losing streams, stream water moves into groundwater systems. The flow {{moving through the}} streambed sediments under {{these two types of}} flow conditions are generally in opposite directions (upward vs. downward). The two opposite flow mechanism will affect the pore size and fine particle content of streambeds. It is thus very likely that the opposite flow conditions affect the streambed hydraulic conductivity. However, comparisons of the hydraulic conductivity (K) of streambeds for losing and gaining streams are not well documented. In this study, we examined the K distribution patterns of sediments below the channel surface or stream banks for the Platte River and its tributaries in Nebraska, USA. Two contrast vertical distribution patterns were observed from the test sites. In gaining reaches, hydraulic conductivity of streambed decreases with the depth of the sediment cores. In losing reaches, hydraulic conductivity increases with the depth of the sediment cores. This contrast patterns in the two types of streams were mostly attributed to flow directions during stream water and groundwater exchanges. In losing reaches, downward movement of water brought fine particle into the otherwise coarse sediment matrix, partially silting the pores. For gaining reaches, upward flow winnows fine particles, increasing the pore spacing in the top parts of streambed, leading to higher hydraulic conductivity in shallower parts of streambeds. These flux directions can impact K values to depth of greater than 5 m. At each test sites, in-situ permeameter tests were conducted to measure the K values of the top streambed layer. Statistical analyses indicated that K values from the sites under losing stream condition are significantly different from the K values from the sites under <b>gaining</b> <b>stream</b> condition...|$|E

We used radon and radium isotopes as tracers of groundwater discharge into the Sebastian River Estuary, a <b>gaining</b> <b>stream</b> in Florida, USA. We developed a spatially-distributed mass balance model that accounts for radon sources and sinks in waters {{above and below the}} estuarine pycnocline. Radium isotopes (224 Ra, 223 Ra, and 226 Ra) were not enriched in groundwater relative to surface water and thus had limited usefulness as tracers at this specific site. The detection of fresh groundwater just beneath the sediment:water interface overlain by brackish bottom water implies that fresh groundwater dominates over saline groundwater in this salt wedge estuary. Lateral groundwater inputs from sandy banks into waters above the estuarine pycnocline were about 6 -fold higher than inputs into waters below the pycnocline. Groundwater discharge rates into the surface layer of the estuary estimated from a radon mass balance ranged from 5 to 18 m 3 /s (or 18 to 62 cm/day if uniformly distributed throughout the entire estuary area). The fluxes into the bottom layer ranged from 0. 8 to 1. 1 m 3 /s (or 2. 8 to 3. 9 cm/day). These groundwater inputs augmented river discharges gauged upstream of the estuary tidal reaches by about 260 % during the dry period and 135 % during the wet period.

40|$|AbstractThe St. Louis River {{watershed}} {{in northeast}} Minnesota hosts a major iron mining district that has operated continuously since the 1890 s. Concern exists that chemical reduction of sulfate that is released from mines enhances the methylation of mercury in the watershed, leading to increased mercury concentrations in St. Louis River fish. This study tests this idea by simulating {{the behavior of}} chemical tracers using a hydrologic flow model (Hydrologic Simulation Program FORTRAN; HSPF) and comparing the results with measured chemistry from several key sites located both upstream and downstream from the mining region. It was found that peaks in measured methylmercury (MeHg), total mercury (THg), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved iron (Fe) concentrations correspond to periods in time when modeled recharge was dominated by active groundwater throughout the watershed. This helps explain why the timing {{and size of the}} MeHg peaks was nearly the same at sites located just upstream and downstream from the mining region. Both the modeled percentages of mine water and the measured sulfate concentrations were low and computed transit times were short for sites downstream from the mining region at times when measured MeHg reached its peak. Taken together, the data and flow model imply that MeHg is released into groundwater that recharges the river through riparian sediments following periods of elevated summer rainfall. The measured sulfate concentrations at the upstream site reached minimum concentrations of approximately 1  mg/L just as MeHg reached its peak, suggesting that reduction of sulfate from non-point sources exerts an important influence on MeHg concentrations at this site. While mines are the dominant source of sulfate to sites downstream from them, it appears that the background sulfate which is present at only 1 – 6  mg/L, has the largest influence on MeHg concentrations. This is because point sourced sulfate is transported generally under oxidized conditions and is not flushed through riparian sediments in a <b>gaining</b> <b>stream</b> watershed system...|$|E
40|$|Among various {{approaches}} for estimating groundwater recharge, chloride mass balance (CMB) method {{is one of}} the most frequently used, in particular, for arid and semiarid regions. Widespread native vegetation clearance, common history in many areas globally, has changed land surface boundary condition, posing a question whether the current system has reached new chloride equilibrium for CMB application. To examine CMB applicability for catchments, conceptual catchment types of various chloride equilibrium conditions are defined. The conceptualization, combined with some local climate conditions, is demonstrated to be useful in examining whether a catchment has reached new chloride equilibrium. The six conceptual catchment types are tested with eleven selected catchments in the Mount Lofty Ranges (MLR), a coastal hilly area in South Australia having experienced historical widespread forest clearance. The results show that six of the eleven catchments match type VI chloride balance condition (chloride non-equilibrium with a <b>gaining</b> <b>stream),</b> with the ratio of stream chloride output over atmospheric chloride input (catchment chloride O/I) ranging from 2 to 4. Two catchments match type V chloride balance condition (chloride non-equilibrium with a losing stream), with catchment chloride O/I values about 0. 5. For these catchments, the CMB method is not appropriate to apply. The results also suggest that neither a below-one chloride O/I value nor a low seasonal fluctuation of streamflow chloride concentration (a factor below 4) guarantees a chloride equilibrium condition in the study area. But a large chloride O/I value (above one) and a large fluctuation of streamflow chloride concentration (a factor of 10 and above) generally indicates either a chloride disequilibrium, or cross-catchment water transfer, or both, for which CMB is not applicable. Based on the regression between chloride O/I values and annual precipitation for type VI catchments, a catchment with annual precipitation of 900 mm in MLR has most likely reached new chloride equilibrium, for which CMB can be applied given that no cross-catchment water transfer occurs. CMB is applied for one catchment at chloride equilibrium, resulted in a net groundwater recharge estimate of 30 mm, about 4 % of annual precipitation...|$|E
