5|$|The route {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 93 northwest of Congress and southeast of Nothing. Beginning at US 93 southbound, SR 97 crosses US 93 northbound after several feet. It crosses through a desert region in a northeasterly direction, meeting a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> connects back to US 93. SR 97 curves northward before heading eastward at an intersection with Burro Creek Road. Again turning northeastward, the roadway meets various local roads, {{most of them}} dirt. The highway meets its northern terminus at SR 96, which continues northwestward toward Bagdad.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to notification from Air Traffic Control, three ambulances from Perth were despatched {{in the direction}} of the crash site, known to be somewhere between Chidlow and York. The crash site was several miles from the road so the ambulance crews travelled eastwards all the way to York without sighting a fire. The crews were eventually guided back along the main road and then along a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> enabled them to drive to within three or four miles of the crash site. The crews then took their first-aid boxes and set out on foot.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{indication of}} the George Washington Air Junction was a 1929 photo taken from an airplane by pilot Orville Blake. It showed three runways which had been cleared on the airport property. They were located just south of a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> became Lockheed Boulevard in Hybla Valley, Virginia. The Washington Air Junction airport was depicted on a 1930 Standard Oil Company Virginia road map as being directly east of Groveton about a mile northwest of the Hybla Valley Airport and about two miles southwest from the Beacon Field Airport. The area was Zeppelin's manager Hugo Eckener's choice for an American terminal for his dirigible airships.|$|E

25|$|The gangsters drove Kilroy {{through the}} back {{streets of the city}} and past an {{industrial}} area. The number of bars and vendor stands in the street began to thin out as they drove Kilroy through a highway in the city's outskirts. The gangsters then turned to a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> stretched between two corn fields. When they got to the private ranch known as Santa Elena, they left Kilroy inside the car overnight. Shortly after dawn, the ranch's caretaker went to see Kilroy and fed him bread, eggs, and water. About twelve hours after Kilroy was kidnapped, Contanzo and his men came to see him. They wrapped his face and mouth with duct tape and walked him through a field to a storage cabin with his hands still tied around his back.|$|E
500|$|PR280 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} north of Thompson {{on the shores}} of Birch Tree Lake with PR391. PR280 runs northeast from PR391 as a two-lane gravel road through the dense woods north of Thompson Airport. As the road bends to the northeast, it runs west of Mystery Lake, which is connected by a gravel road that runs to the shoreline. Continuing northeast, PR280 leaves the Mystery Lake area and soon reaches a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> connects to nearby Moak Lake.|$|E
500|$|In June 1930, an {{agreement}} was {{made between the}} county and the state {{to share in the}} construction and maintenance on the road to Kane Springs from Julian; prison crews were to make up some of the workforce. Vista Way opened on November 26, 1930. By 1932, the road from Escondido to Ramona was a gravel road, and the portion from Julian to U.S. Route 99 (US99), which is currently designated as SR86, was still a <b>dirt</b> <b>road.</b> <b>That</b> year, the cost was predicted to be $176,000 (about $ in [...] dollars).|$|E

Although the <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> are shorter in distance, the tarred roads offer more comfort.|$|R
500|$|MS 444 {{starts at}} a T-intersection with MS 1 and travels eastward. The route travels through {{farmland}} {{in a straight}} line. MS 444 intersects Caston Road, a <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> also leads to Duncan. MS 444 continues east, intersecting minor dirt roads. East of Yates Road, the road enters a small area of trees, before re-entering to more farmland. The route curves slightly to the southeast about [...] later, at Sandy Ridge Road. MS 444 soon crosses the Hushpuckena River, and enters into Duncan. Near the center of Duncan, the route intersects the old alignment of US 61. The road continues east and ends at a T-intersection with US 61.|$|E
500|$|Part of {{the highway}} was once part of the Patterson–Dutchess County Line Road, a [...] <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> {{extended}} from Banks Corner to Whaley Lake. Plans were finalized in 1919 to rebuild the previously inadequate road; the project cost an estimated $43,500 ($517,298 2007 USD), including $15,225 ($181,054 2007 USD) of Putnam County's portion of the construction. In May 1919, the Danbury News reported, [...] "On the road between Sodom and Pawling turn left and run through Patterson and continue to West Patterson. From West Patterson a new road about one and one-half miles in length is under construction which connects with a good macadam road passing Whaley Pond and running to Stonehouse, thence continuing ... to Newburgh." [...] The new road was completed in November of that year.|$|E
2500|$|This second {{bidding process}} {{was met with}} success, as the John Arborio, Inc. company of Poughkeepsie {{for a total of}} $203,242.80 (1951USD) won the bid in January1951. The {{contract}} would include the construction of the two bridges and reconstruction of NY214. The new roadway would be [...] wide and paved with gravel and asphalt, replacing the <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> went through the notch. This contract would also eliminate curves and grades along NY214 from Stony Clove Notch to Kaaterskill Junction and be completed by December 1, 1951.|$|E
5000|$|The King road drag (also {{known as}} the Missouri road drag and the split log road drag) was a road grader {{implement}} for grading <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> <b>that</b> revolutionized {{the maintenance of the}} <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> in the early 1900s. It was invented by David Ward King, who went by [...] "D. Ward King" [...] and who was a farmer whose farm was in Holt Township, near Maitland, Missouri.|$|R
50|$|From the Pine Lake Community {{there are}} a number of <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> <b>that</b> lead out into the mountains. There are {{primarily}} two main routes out of the community, Flag Mine Road and the ATV trail head located at Hualapai Mountain Park which alleviates some of the traffic in the neighborhood.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, Douskey {{lived in}} Cornish, New Hampshire, near the equally reclusive J. D. Salinger. When Douskey would run into {{tourists}} anxious {{to ferret out}} Salinger, he would misdirect the intruders down a series of <b>dirt</b> <b>roads</b> <b>that</b> led them away from Salinger's house into nearby towns.|$|R
2500|$|The {{tower is}} located within a discontiguous {{parcel of the}} Sundown Wild Forest {{management}} unit. The old road still exists, but is now closed even to state use. Access is via the trail, which begins on Dinch Road, an old, rocky <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> winds down around the mountain's northwest slope towards the East Branch of the Neversink River. The trail follows yellow plastic markers [...] and vertically [...] up to the tower. Along the way are 10 numbered wooden signs corresponding to listings in an interpretive brochure created by the Red Hill Fire Tower Committee, available at the trail register. They identify plant species found {{in the area of}} the markers, many common to Catskill forests.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{at least}} three points of access to the waters {{surrounding}} Linwood. The west end of Hamilton Avenue abuts Patcong Creek, allowing the launching of canoes or kayaks (and possibly trailered boats). An unnamed dirt road (Poplar Docks) just to the east of the Linwood Country Club ends several hundred yards into the marshes, and it may allow launching of trailered boats at low tide (the end of the road tends to submerge at high tide). The eastern end of Seaview Avenue is a better-constructed <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> ends at a dock (known as [...] "Seaview Docks" [...] to locals) on Sod Thorofare, and is suitable for trailered boats. A parking permit is required at the Hamilton Avenue and Seaview Avenue sites. Permits are valid for the entire calendar year, though their purchase price varies with time of acquisition: ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Kennedy's inquest testimony, {{he made a}} {{wrong turn}} onto Dike Road, which was an unlit <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> led to Dike Bridge (also spelled Dyke Bridge). Dike Road was unpaved, but Kennedy, driving at [...] "approximately twenty miles an hour [...] ", took [...] "no {{particular}} notice" [...] of that fact, and {{did not realize that}} he was no longer headed toward the ferry landing. Dike Bridge was a wooden structure that at the time was not protected by a guardrail and was angled obliquely to the road. A fraction of a second before he reached the bridge, Kennedy applied his brakes and then drove {{over the side of the}} bridge. The car plunged into tide-swept Poucha Pond (there a channel) and came to rest, upside down, underwater. Kennedy recalled later that he was able to swim free of the vehicle, but Kopechne was not. At the inquest, Kennedy claimed that he called Kopechne's name several times from the shore and tried to swim down to reach her seven or eight times. Knowing that the woman was still trapped inside the vehicle, Kennedy rested on the bank for around 15 minutes before he returned on foot to Lawrence Cottage, which was the site of the party that was attended by Kopechne and the other [...] "boiler room girls". Kennedy denied seeing any house with a light on during his walk back to Lawrence Cottage.|$|E
50|$|The {{inhabitant}} settlements of {{the region}} formed from the distribution of its settlers, who occupied various places, some separated by large distances.

2500|$|Thornhill, Connecticut – {{the village}} near which the Austins live {{in most of}} the books. The Austin home is akin to the Murry {{farmhouse}} and to Crosswicks in size, age and environs; for example, all three have a [...] "star-watching rock" [...] out back. The Austin house is outside Thornhill, {{at the end of a}} <b>dirt</b> <b>road</b> <b>that</b> intersects the [...] "old Boston Post Road". [...] The Austins have an old barn, in which Vicky's brother John works on building a mock-up of a space suit. Dr. Austin sees patients a few evenings a week in his office at one end of the house, which has its own entrance. A short drive from the Austin house is Hawk Mountain (apparently a fictionalized version of Mohawk Mountain near Cornwall, Connecticut), another place the family goes to talk and look at stars. The nearby town is Clovenford, where Dr. Austin works at the regional hospital. The state in which Thornhill is located is not initially given, but in The Moon by Night John Austin tells Zachary Gray that the family is from Connecticut. L'Engle and her family, the Franklins, lived in a similar Connecticut locale when Meet the Austins was written. In a 1995 introduction to the Austin family paperbacks, L'Engle states that [...] "Indeed, the Austins do a great many things that my family did, including living in a small dairy farm village." [...] L'Engle also mentions Clovenford in a fictional incident in A Circle of Quiet (p.87).|$|E
