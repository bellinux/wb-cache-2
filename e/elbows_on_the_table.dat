60|$|The Pfarrer {{pushed aside}} his empty pot and leaned his <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|Ed {{rested his}} <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and fixed his bright black eyes on his father.|$|E
60|$|Elsie {{sat with}} her <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> gazing in silence towards the empty fireplace. She looked weary and sad.|$|E
60|$|Jake roused {{himself with}} a jerk. Dick leaned forward wearily with his <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> but he looked resolute.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> coroner, one <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> {{one large}} hand holding firmly the {{somewhat}} fleshy chin, {{looked at the}} juryman somewhat contemptuously.|$|R
60|$|Kate {{looked at}} her again, but less {{steadily}} than before; and resting her <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> covered {{her eyes with her}} hand.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat down}} {{opposite}} him, with her <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> her chin in her palm, her {{eyes full of}} shadows.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must sit up straight. I mustn't sprawl with my <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> It is only common, vulgar people behave that way." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{struck a}} match {{and held it}} for her. Joan sat with her <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and smoked in silence. She was thinking.|$|E
6000|$|And he, with {{a sudden}} change of manner, and leaning forward with an <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> - [...] "Do you think this entirely wise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, what's {{the matter}} with you, Tony?" [...] {{inquires}} Mr. Guppy, looking at him, snuffers in hand, as he sits down with his <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Gregory, {{and for a}} {{long time}} he could not say any more. He sat with his <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and his head against his lifted hand.|$|R
60|$|She shivered, as if cold, {{and setting}} her <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> {{she took her}} chin in her hands, and sat staring before her.|$|E
60|$|Leonard {{lost the}} indulgent air {{he had so}} far assumed, and Andrew, leaning forward with <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> fixed his eyes on him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir!" [...] adjudged Gearheart, after a pause, leaning his <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{and looking}} {{out of the door}} on the far-stretching, sun-glorified plain.|$|E
60|$|Neither of them answered. Blanca {{lay back}} in her chair; the priest sat with one <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> his cheek resting on his upturned palm. He was very tired.|$|R
6000|$|Leonard put his <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> mumbling to himself, [...] "And these of Eustace's be the courtly manners {{my father}} would have me learn; they cost a great deal too much trouble!" ...|$|R
60|$|Miner {{was just}} sitting down to <b>the</b> <b>table</b> when Morris entered. His sleeves were rolled up. He had his old white hat on his head. He lounged upon one <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> His whole bearing was swinish.|$|R
60|$|Emlyn, who {{had been}} {{standing}} all this while, sat herself down, set her <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and rested her chin upon her clenched hands.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But what's she to {{do while}} we're away?' said I, putting my small <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to argue the point. 'She can't live by herself.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{threw himself}} with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> {{covering}} {{his face with his}} hands as he spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well!' {{said the}} matron, leaning her <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and looking reflectively at the fire; 'I'm {{sure we have}} all on {{us a great deal}} to be {{grateful}} for! A great deal, if we did but know it. Ah!' ...|$|R
60|$|To this her son made no {{immediate}} answer, but {{sat with his}} <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and his head upon his hand looking moodily at the fire-place. He {{did not wish to}} commit himself if he could possibly avoid it.|$|R
60|$|Resting his <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> {{and with}} {{his hand to his}} brow, Caron sat deep in thought, his {{forefinger}} and thumb pressed against his closed eyelids. From beyond the board Mademoiselle watched him anxiously and waited. At last he looked up.|$|R
60|$|She {{had never}} heard {{philosophy}} pass those lips before. Impressed even in her agitation, she leaned her <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> her chin on her hands.|$|E
60|$|Armand {{led her to}} the bench, and {{she sank}} down on it, numb and inert, resting her <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and her head in her hands.|$|E
60|$|He {{was leaning}} with his <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and his chin on his hands, {{looking into a}} futurity {{which seemed to be}} sketched out on the tablecloth.|$|E
60|$|Miltoun {{placed his}} <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and leaning his chin on his hand, {{regarded}} {{the champion of}} lost causes without speaking. There was such a turmoil going on within him that with difficulty he could force his lips to obey him.|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} we all changed our {{attitude}} slightly. Millsâ€™ staring eyes moved for a glance towards Blunt, I, who was occupying the divan, raised myself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cushions {{a little and}} Mr. Blunt, with half a turn, put his <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
60|$|But, {{when his}} nephew, leaning an <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask {{looked at him}} {{sideways}} with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of indifference.|$|R
60|$|Martina {{rested her}} <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and her chin upon her little hand, staring me {{full in the}} face with her quick eyes that pierced like nails.|$|E
60|$|The {{old woman}} leaned her <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and resting her face upon her two hands, {{made a show}} of being in great distress--or really was, perhaps.|$|E
60|$|He set his <b>elbows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> {{and took}} {{his head in his}} hands. A groan escaped him. She heard it, and looked at him in her furtive way.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But--' 'And Christ {{was born}} of a woman.' She did not answer. A silence fell. Wharton pulled his {{mustache}} impatiently and kept an eye <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trail. Grace leaned her <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> her face set with resolve. The smile had died away. Father Roubeau shifted his ground.|$|R
60|$|The boy {{repeated}} the exact words {{he had used}} <b>on</b> entering <b>the</b> hut. Yeobright rested his <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and shaded {{his face with his}} hand; and the mother looked as if she wondered how a man could want more of what had stung him so deeply.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish {{to heaven}} {{other people had}} none!' cried Owen, {{suddenly}} changing his tone, and sitting down opposite to Phoebe, his <b>elbow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and speaking earnestly. 'I would give the world that my sister were like you. Did you ever hear of anything so preposterous as this Irish business?' ...|$|R
