40|$|This article {{examines}} the federal response to mortgage distress during the Great Depression: It documents features of the housing cycle of the 1920 s and early 1930 s, focusing on the growth of mortgage debt and the subsequent sharp increase in mortgage defaults and foreclosures during the Depression. It summarizes the major federal initiatives to reduce foreclosures and reform mortgage market practices, focusing especially on {{the activities of the}} Home Owners ’ Loan Corporation (HOLC), which acquired and refinanced one million delinquent mortgages between 1933 and 1936. Because the conditions under which the HOLC operated were unusual, the author cautions against drawing strong policy lessons from the HOLC’s activities. Nonetheless, similarities between the Great Depression and the recent episode suggest that a review of the historical experience can pro-vide insights about alternative policies to relieve mortgage distress.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{increasing}} competition in the banking market, increasing regulatory requirements for transparency and sound risk–creation on this basis of adequate risk provisions in the banking sector is of paramount importance. In this paper, firstly it is proposed to use for estimating credit risks the exact maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) {{of the structure of}} stratified population for any sizes of the credit portfolio. These exact MLE could be applied to estimate Basel-II risk parameter PD (Probability of Default) and could be used to optimise provisions for covering expected losses of consumer credit portfolio. In usual banking practice for estimating risk parameter PD, the frequencies (rates) of default credits of the whole consumer portfolio or of sub–portfolios of the whole consumer portfolio are usually using. But the statistical characteristics of these estimates, such as unbiased property, consistency, efficiency, exact and asymptotic distributions, usually are unknown. The new statistical estimations have derived for characteristics used in the vintage analysis of consumer credit portfolio. These estimations for delinquency rates with different DPD (<b>Days</b> <b>Past</b> <b>Due)</b> are the exact maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) of the structure of stratified population for any sizes of the credit portfolio. These exact MLE could be applied to estimate Basel-II risk parameter PD (Probability of Default) and could be used to optimise provisions for covering expected losses of consumer credit portfolio.

Only two studies examined the extent to which foreclosure may have disproportionate impacts on ethnic or racial minority populations. Home foreclosure adversely affects health and mental health through channels operating at multiple levels: at the individual level, the stress of personally experiencing foreclosure was associated with worsened mental health and adverse health behaviors, which were in turn linked to poorer health status; at the community level, increasing degradation of the neighborhood environment had indirect, cross-level adverse effects on health and mental health. Early intervention may be able to prevent acute economic shocks from eventually developing into the chronic stress of foreclosure, with all of the attendant benefits this implies for health and mental health status.

40|$|The Credit Scoring add-on in SAS ® Enterprise Miner ™ {{is widely}} used to build binary target (good, bad) {{scorecards}} for probability of default. The process involves grouping variables using weight of evidence, and then performing logistic regression to produce predicted probabilities. Learn {{how to use the}} same tools to build binned variable scorecards for Loss Given Default. We will explain the theoretical principles behind the method and use actual data to demonstrate how we did it. Loss Given Default Loss Given Default (LGD) is defined as the loss to a lender when a counterparty (borrower) defaults. It {{is one of the key}} parameters banks need to estimate for measurement of credit risk under the Internal Ratings Based approaches specified by the Basel II accord – the other 2 measures being probability of default (PD) and Exposure at Default (EAD). LGD is normally estimated as a continuous variable that predicts the ratio of loss to balance at the time of default, with a range of 0 to 1. Under Basel II scenarios, LGD is used to measure expected losses due to credit risk, which are eventually used in the calculations of Risk Weighted Assets and ultimately, regulatory capital. In addition, LGD, along with other measures is also used for measurement of economic capital and risk based pricingFor Basel II risk measurement purposes, ‘default ’ is generally taken as 90 <b>days</b> <b>past</b> <b>due,</b> however, other definitions have also been used.

40|$|The {{financial}} system of Serbia is highly bank-centric and euroised, {{which is a}} common specific feature of {{financial system}}s in developing countries. High level of euroisation represents an adequate environment {{for the development of}} emphasized interaction of foreign exchange and credit risks; therefore, creation of the spillover mechanism of foreign exchange risk to credit risk is immanent for euroised systems. Although maintaining the stability of the dinar exchange rate is a secondary goal of the National Bank of Serbia in relation to price and financial stability as the primary goals, in terms of existence of the aforesaid spillover mechanism, maintaining stability of the dinar exchange rate represents the area where there is an interaction between the goals of monetary policy (price stability) and those of financial stability policy (maintaining and strengthening the financial system’s stability). In order to explore whether the spillover mechanism of foreign exchange risk to credit risk exists in Serbia’s financial system, the vector autoregressive (VAR) model is applied on data from the Serbian banking sector to quantify the impact of changes in the dinar exchange rates on the rate of non-performing loans (NPLs); the sample was formed in the period of increased instability of the dinar exchange rate, from 31 January 2008 to 31 December 2010. As we have quantitatively confirmed the impact of increase in the dinar exchange rate on the increase of 90 - 120 <b>days</b> <b>past</b> <b>due</b> NPLs, we can conclude that the existence of expressed interaction between foreign exchange risk and credit risk in the Serbian financial system represents a paradigm of the regulator’s need to achieve contemporary goals of monetary and financial stability policy by maintaining relative stability of the dinar exchange rates. Depreciation of the local currency has inflationary pressure on price stability and simultaneously influences the achievement of financial stability goals through the spillover mechanism of foreign exchange risk to credit risk. In addition to taking systematic measures to reduce the level of euroisation and introduce the specific regulatory requirements, in order to protect banks and clients from the dinar exchange rate volatility, the regulator faces extremely important task of maintaining relative stability of the dinar exchange rate as the instrument to simultaneous achievement of goals of monetary and financial stability policies...|$|E
