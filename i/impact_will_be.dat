5|$|The {{introduction}} of deer to New Zealand {{began in the}} middle of the 19th century, and current populations are primarily European red deer, with only 15 percent being elk. There is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous red deer to the extent that pure elk may no longer exist in the wild in New Zealand. These deer have had an adverse impact on forest regeneration of some plant species, as they consume more palatable species which are replaced with those that are less favored by the elk. The long-term <b>impact</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> an alteration of the types of plants and trees found, and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them. As in Chile and Argentina, the IUCN has declared that red deer and elk populations in New Zealand are an invasive species.|$|E

25|$|There is an {{implication}} {{that many of}} these <b>impacts</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> detrimental—especially for the three-quarters of the world's poor who depend on agriculture systems. The report does, however, note that owing to the great diversity of coastal environments; regional and local differences in projected relative sea level and climate changes; and differences in the resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems, sectors, and countries, the <b>impacts</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> highly variable in time and space.|$|R
25|$|Human {{soft tissue}} is highly deformable, and its {{mechanical}} properties vary significantly {{from one person}} to another. Impact testing results showed that the stiffness and the damping resistance of a test subject’s tissue are correlated with the mass, velocity, and size of the striking object. Such properties may be useful for forensics investigation when contusions were induced. When solid object impact a human soft tissues, the energy of the <b>impact</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> absorbed by the tissues to reducing effect of the impact or the pain level, therefore; subjects with more soft tissue thickness tended to absorb the impacts with less aversion.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{opportunity}} costs of incorporating a socio-economic consideration (SEC) into national regulation on genetically modified (GM) crops. Australia approved {{the cultivation of}} GM canola through a science-based risk assessment in 2003, but allowed state moratoria to be instituted on an SEC-based on potential trade impacts over the period 2004 to 2008 and 2010 in the main canola growing states. This analysis constructs a counterfactual assessment, using the Canadian experience to create an S-curve of adoption, to measure the opportunity costs of the SEC-based moratoria through environmental and economic impacts between 2004 and 2014. The <b>impacts</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> assessed through a per hectare analysis of canola, by variety, and subsequently aggregated into GM and non-GM variables in New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia, and Australia as a whole. These variables, and their respective number of canola hectares are {{used to create a}} cumulative impact of the delay from the SEC-based moratoria through comparison of the scenario under the S-curve and the one reflecting the actuality. The environmental <b>impacts</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> assessed through the amount of active ingredients applied during pest management, the Environmental Impact Quotient, and greenhouse gas emissions as a by-product of fuel use from the change in machinery passes from cultivation and spray applications. The economic <b>impacts</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> measured through the variable costs of the weed control programs, yield, and producer margins, comparing impacts between gross margins, comparative margins, and a calculated contribution margin. The objective of this work is to gain insight into the opportunity cost and impact of incorporating SECs into GM crop regulation...|$|R
