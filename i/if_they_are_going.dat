5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E

I don't support arson. I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, so on some level I understand. I just don't like the idea of that. Maybe that is wishy-washy of me, because I don't want those buildings standing <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to hurt anyone. And the ALF has never hurt mice nor mare.|$|E
25|$|Specific trap {{sites for}} heavy mineral sand placer {{deposits}} are in beaches on the leeward side of headlands, as this forms a low-energy zone which traps sediments carried {{along by the}} longshore drift. Also, sand bars developed at the mouths of rivers which feed the placer deposits are rich trap sites where the winnowing action of the waves are most efficient, because heavy minerals, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be too heavy to be moved, will deposit at an isthmus in preference to drifting too far down the beach.|$|E
25|$|Saltwater {{fly fishing}} {{is most often}} done from a boat, either a shallow draft flat boat is used to pursue species such as bonefish, redfish, permit and tarpon in shallow waters, or from larger {{offshore}} boats for pursuing sailfish, tuna, dorado, marlin and other pelagics and may be done from shore, such as wading flats for bonefish or redfish or surf fishing for striped bass and other assorted fish. Typically, most trout fly fisherman need to practice new skills to catch saltwater fish on a fly rod. Ocean fish are usually harder to catch. They can be extremely spooky, and much larger. Trout fisherman need to practice with at least an 8 weight fly rod and accurately cast the line 30–90 feet <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to have success—particularly in the flat areas fishing for bonefish, redfish, permit, tarpon, jacks and more.|$|E

500|$|With no {{heir to the}} throne, Satyavati asked Bhishma {{to marry}} the widows of Vichitravirya (following the {{practice}} of niyoga in its narrower sense, as a levirate marriage) and rule as king. Bhishma refused, reminding Satyavati of the promise he made to her father and his vow of bachelorhood. He suggests [...] that a Brahmin could be hired to father children on the widows, thus preserving the dynasty. Revealing to Bhishma the tale of her encounter with Parashara, Satyavati well {{knew that this was}} the time to call her son Vyasa to aid her. Satyavati coaxed Vyasa to have niyoga with his brother's widows, saying: [...] "from affection for thy brother Vichitravirya, for the perpetuation of our dynasty, for the sake of this Bhishma's request and my command, for kindness to all creatures, {{for the protection of the}} people and from the liberality of thy heart, O sinless one, it behooveth thee to do what I say." [...] After convincing Vyasa, Satyavati managed ( [...] with great difficulty) to obtain the consent of her [...] "virtuous" [...] daughters-in-law. In the Mahabharata, Vyasa agreed immediately to the niyoga. In the Devi Bhagavata Purana version, Vyasa initially refused Satyavati's proposal. He argued that Vichitravirya's wives were like his daughters; having niyoga with them was a heinous sin, through which no good could come. As a master of [...] "realpolitik", the hungry-for-grandsons Satyavati asserted that to preserve the dynasty, wrong directives by elders should be followed <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to reduce the sorrow of a mother. Vyasa finally agreed to that [...] "disgusting task", but suggested that offspring of perversity cannot be a source of joy.|$|E

And because of that, that's why they are scared, because they don't know to what level we will go to protect, but we will protect.|$|E

The second attempt awakes Skrýmir. Skrýmir gives them advice; <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be cocky at the keep of Útgarðr it would be better for them to turn back now, for Útgarða-Loki's men there won't put up with it.

2500|$|The {{second half}} was {{reported}} to be a [...] "very poor exhibition of football" [...] with substitutes playing at most positions. [...] Michigan's sole points of the second half came on a fumble recovery by William Louis Day. [...] Michigan missed the extra point kicks on its final three touchdowns. [...] (Touchdowns were worth five points and goals from touchdown (or extra points) worth one point under 1898 rules.) [...] Guy Blencoe also missed a field goal from placement from the 40-yard line in the second half. [...] In assessing the team's performance, the Detroit Free Press opined that the team was green, ragged, and slow, and concluded that [...] "the coaches certainly have their work cut out for them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to make a winning team out of the raw material at hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 5, 2007, Libby {{was sentenced}} to 30 months in prison, a fine of US$250,000, and two years of {{probation}} (supervised release) after the expiration of his prison term. According to The Washington Post, Judge Walton expressed his belief that the trial did not prove Libby knew that Plame worked in an undercover capacity when he disclosed her identity to several reporters. He added, however, that [...] "anybody at that high-level position had a unique and special obligation before they said anything about anything associated with a national security agency ... make every conceivable effort" [...] to verify their status before releasing information about them. Walton stated [...] "While {{there is no evidence}} that Mr. Libby knew what the situation was, he surely did not take any efforts to find out,...I think public officials need to know <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to step over the line, there are going to be consequences.... causes people to think our government does not work for them." ...|$|E

[...] Giles remarks, [...] "they are kind of dependent." [...] Although the Baltimore ACORN staffer pointed out their plans were illegal, after O'Keefe says, [...] "we {{are going to be}} putting a roof over [...] head", the ACORN employee states, [...] "well then you know what you can always claim them as dependents." [...] Later, the employee says, [...] "you are gonna use three of them they are gonna be under 16 so you is eligible to get child tax credit and additional child tax credit." [...] When O'Keefe asks, [...] "what <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be making money because they are performing tricks too?" [...] the employee replies, [...] "but if they making money and they are underage, then you shouldn't be letting anybody know anyway." [...] The Baltimore employees were fired by ACORN after the video was released.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of April 12, an armed crowd rallied under a banner that read [...] "Liberty Freedom For God We Stand". [...] Most had signs, many of which chided [...] "government thugs". Addressing the protesters, Bundy said, [...] "We {{definitely}} don't recognize [...] jurisdiction or authority, his arresting power or policing power in any way" [...] and [...] "We're about {{ready to take the}} country over with force!" [...] After the BLM announced a suspension of the roundup, Bundy suggested blocking a highway. Armed protesters blocked a portion of Interstate 15 for more than two hours, causing traffic backups for three miles in both directions. Protesters also converged at the mouth of Gold Butte, the preserve where the cattle were corralled, and a tense, hour-long standoff ensued. BLM rangers warned over loudspeakers that they were prepared to use tear gas. Former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, who was with the protesters, said that they were [...] "strategizing to put all the women up at the front. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to start shooting, it's going to be women {{that are going to be}} televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers". Protestors with rifles took positions on a highway overpass, seemingly offering cover as horse-mounted wranglers led protesters to face off against heavily equipped BLM rangers and snipers. Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, who officially traveled to the Bundy standoff to convey that Utah did not want the cattle, put the number of federal agents present at over 200. According to Las Vegas assistant sheriff Joe Lombardo, there were 24 BLM rangers and Las Vegas deputy sheriffs present at the standoff. Las Vegas police were not allowed to wear protective gear because of fear that it would be seen as a provocation. Clark County Sheriff Gillespie blames the escalation of the situation on the BLM, stating to the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the BLM has lied to him about having a place to take the cattle and the BLM did not attend town-hall meetings and disregarded his advice as County Sheriff.|$|E
