A number of minor Scottish sects developed, such as the Bereans, Buchanites, Daleites and Glassites.|$|E

25|$|Timbuktu's rapid {{economic}} growth in the 13th and 14th centuries drew many scholars from nearby Walata (today in Mauretania), leading up to the city's golden age in the 15th and 16th centuries that proved <b>fertile</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> scholarship of religions, arts and sciences. To the people of Timbuktu, literacy and books were symbols of wealth, power, and blessings and the acquisition of books became a primary concern for scholars. An active trade in books between Timbuktu {{and other parts of the}} Islamic world and emperor Askia Mohammed's strong support led to the writing of thousands of manuscripts.|$|E

25|$|The Chinese folk {{religious}} sects {{are mostly}} concentrated in northern and northeastern China, although {{with a significant}} influence reaching the Yangtze River Delta since the 16th century. The northern provinces have been a <b>fertile</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the sect tradition because {{of a number of}} reasons: ① firstly, popular religious movements were active in the region already in the Han dynasty, and they deeply penetrated local society; ② secondly, northern provinces are characterised by social mobility around the capital and weak traditional social structure, thus folk religious sects fulfill the demand of individual searching for new forms of community and social network.|$|E

Iyer responded promptly, inviting Acharya to London. It was here in London that Acharya was introduced to the nationalism of India House.|$|E
40|$|Psychological {{attitudes towards}} service and {{personal}} robots are selectively examined {{from the vantage}} point of psychoanalysis. Significant case studies include the uncanny valley effect, brain-actuated robots evoking magic mental powers, parental attitudes towards robotic children, idealizations of robotic soldiers, persecutory fantasies involving robotic components and systems. Freudian theories of narcissism, animism, infantile complexes, ego ideal, and ideal ego are brought to bear on the interpretation of these various items. The horizons of Human-robot Interaction are found to afford new and <b>fertile</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> psychoanalytic theorizing beyond strictly therapeutic contexts...|$|R

25|$|The actions {{organized}} by these organizations are most {{visible in the}} Ukrainian part of historic Novorossiya (New Russia) {{in the south of}} Ukraine and in the Crimea, a region in which in some areas Russians are the largest ethnic group. As ethnic Russians constitute {{a significant part of the}} population in these largely Russophone parts of southern Ukraine (and a majority in the Crimea), these territories maintain particularly strong historic ties with Russia on the human level. Thus, a stronger than elsewhere in the country pro-Russian political sentiment makes the area a more <b>fertile</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the radical pro-Russian movements that are not as common elsewhere in the country.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, {{northern}} and central France became <b>fertile</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> {{the growth of}} devotions to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary. In June 1700, a young Louis Grignion de Montfort was ordained a priest and was assigned to Nantes. He became a fervent preacher for devotion to the Sacred Heart of Mary. Although Montfort died in 1716, his teachings shaped Mariology and later influenced several popes. In 1830 in Paris, Saint Catherine Labouré reported a vision in which she saw the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Immaculate Heart of Mary, the Heart of Jesus thorn-crowned and the Heart of Mary pierced with a sword.|$|E
