40|$|Purpose To assess {{clinical}} outcomes and toxicities {{in patients with}} stage III unresectable {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) treated with a moderately escalated hypofractionated radiotherapy delivered with <b>Helical</b> Intensity-Modulated <b>Technique</b> in combination with sequential or concurrent chemotherapy. Methods and Materials Sixty-one consecutive patients considered non-progressive after 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy were treated with a moderately escalated hypofractionated radiation course of 30 daily fractions of 2. 25 - 2. 28 Gy each administered in 6 weeks up to a total dose of 67. 5 Gy– 68. 4 Gy (range, 64. 5 Gy– 71. 3 Gy). Thirty-two received sequential RT after 2 more cycles (total= 4 cycles) of chemotherapy, while twenty-nine were treated with concurrent chemo-radiation. The target was considered the gross tumour volume and the clinically proven nodal regions, without elective nodal irradiation. Results With a median follow up of 27 months (range 6 to 40), one-year and 2 -year OS rate for all patients was 77 % and 53 % respectively, with a median survival duration of 18. 6 months in the sequential group and 24. 1 months in the concomitant group. No Grade ≥ 4 acute and late toxicity was reported. Acute Grade 3 treatment-related pneumonitis was detected in 10 % of patients. Two patients, both receiving the concurrent schedule, developed a Grade 3 acute esophagitis. The overall incidence of late Grade 3 lung toxicity was 5 %.

Water injection experiments were conducted and the behavior of specimens with and without the presence of filter paper was compared under constant shear stress. The use of helical filter paper ensured more uniform distribution of injected moisture, and reduced the discrepancy of moisture along specimen’s height by around 50 %.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied 60 patients (31 men, 29 women; age range, 31 - 84 years; mean age, 62 years) with suspected pancreatic malignancy. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups. For group A (n = 30), unenhanced scans through the liver and pancreas were followed by two separate acquisitions (dual-phase) at 20 - 25 and at 60 - 80 sec after IV contrast administration. For group B (n = 30), unenhanced scans were followed by one set of scans (single-phase) acquired caudocranially (from the inferior hepatic margin to the diaphragm) starting 50 sec after IV contrast administration. Two observers independently scored images for the presence of tumor and for assessment of tumor resectability. RESULTS: Comparison of dual-phase versus single-phase helical CT for tumor detection showed a diagnostic accuracy for observer 1 of 87 % and 90 %, respectively, and for observer 2, of 90 % and 87 %, respectively. For both <b>helical</b> CT <b>techniques,</b> the overall agreement between the two observers was 83 % (kappa = 0. 73 +/- 0. 03) for single-phase helical CT and 90 % (kappa = 0. 89 +/- 0. 03) for dual-phase helical CT. The assessment of resectability was affected by the low number of resectable tumors (n = 8).

For the test conditions used here, most techniques were capable of determining the CoR to within 0. 3 cm, as long as the spherical range of motion (RoM) of the joint was 45 ° or more. Under the most stringent conditions tested, however, the SCoRE was capable of best determining the CoR, to within approximately 1. 2 mm with a RoM of 20 °.

METHODS: We studied 124 grafts with 577 segments in 64 patients with a heart rate (HR) < 85 bpm who underwent CT coronary angiography (CTCA); 34 patients with RGH-CTCA and 30 patients with PGA-CTCA. The image quality of the bypass grafts was assessed by a 5 -point scale (1 = excellent to 5 = non-diagnostic) for each segment (proximal anastomosis, proximal, middle, distal course of graft body, and distal anastomosis). Other objective image quality indices such as noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were assessed. Radiation doses were also compared. RESULTS: Patient characteristics of the two groups were well matched except HR. The HR of the PGA group was lower than that of the RGH group (62. 0 ± 5. 0 vs. 65. 7 ± 7. 4). For both groups, over 90 % of segments received excellent or good image quality scores and none was non-evaluative. The image quality generally degraded as graft segment approached to distal anastomosis regardless of techniques and graft types. Image quality scores of the PGA group were better than those of the RGH group (1. 51 ± 0. 53 vs. 1. 73 ± 0. 62; p< 0. 001). There was no significantly difference of objective image quality between two techniques, and the effective radiation dose was significantly lower in the PGA group (7. 0 ± 1. 2 mSv) than that of the RGH group (20. 0 ± 4. 6 mSv) (p< 0. 001), with a 65. 0 % dose reduction.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{high temperature}} laser material processing, {{focusing on the}} applications for the aerospace industry. This study looks at three representative processes with three different interactions of plasma: 1) pulsed laser deposition (PLD) process for thin coating deposition where material deposit occurs via plasma and vapor, 2) drilling process for material removal to create shaped holes for efficient cooling and 3) direct metal deposition (DMD) process (very weak plasma) to clad a thick layer. In this study, thin coatings for two important turbine blade materials were produced by the PLD technique. Yttria-stabilized zirconia films produced by the PLD were very smooth and dense. The target stoichiometry was well preserved in films. The PLD technique was also used to deposit single crystal (SC) Ni-base superalloys on the substrates of the same material. The homoepitaxial growth of the SC Ni-base superalloy film was successfully obtained without re-melting of the substrate by the PLD process. Laser drilling experiments were carried out to generate cooling holes in an aerospace material, Inconel 718. The effect of the process parameters and different drilling methods on the hole qualities were comprehensively investigated. Using both the <b>helical</b> drilling <b>technique</b> at a high duty ratio (10 %) and O 2 assist gas produces the best drilling performance under the acceptable drilling time (~ 5 s) for the industrial application. In this study, a numerical simulation for pulsed laser drilling was also carried out to provide the fundamental understanding of the high power density laser process and to investigate the effect of pulse format on the drilling performance. It was found that a modulated beam using a short pulse width and a high beam intensity yielded better drilling performance than the conventional pulsed laser under the same average power. Spectroscopic studies during laser drilling and DMD were carried out {{for the purpose of}} process diagnostics by employing the optical emission spectroscopy. The results indicate that plasma parameters can be used to monitor the drilling depth during laser drilling and the elemental composition created during the DMD...|$|R
5000|$|The U-matic {{machines}} were always made with Stereo, and both Betamax and VHS recorded the audio tracks using a fixed linear recording head. However the relatively slow tape speed of Beta and VHS was inadequate for good quality audio, and significantly limited the sound quality. Betamax's release of Beta Hi-Fi {{in the early}} 1980s was quickly followed by JVCs release of HiFi audio on VHS (model HR-D725U). Both systems delivered flat full-range frequency response (20 Hz to 20 kHz), excellent 70 dB signal-to-noise ratio (in consumer space, {{second only to the}} compact disc), dynamic range of 90 dB, and professional audio-grade channel separation (more than 70 dB). In VHS the incoming HiFi audio is frequency modulated ("Audio FM" [...] or [...] "AFM"), modulating the two stereo channels (L, R) on two different frequency-modulated carriers and recorded using the same high-bandwidth <b>helical</b> scanning <b>technique</b> used for the video signal. To avoid crosstalk and interference from the primary video carrier, VHS used depth multiplexing, in which the modulated audio carrier pair was placed in the hitherto-unused frequency range between the luminance and the color carrier (below 1.6 MHz), and recorded first. Subsequently, the video head erases and re-records the video signal (combined luminance and color signal) over the same tape surface, but the video signal's higher center frequency results in a shallower magnetization of the tape, allowing both the video and residual AFM audio signal to coexist on tape. (PAL versions of Beta Hi-Fi use the same technique). During playback, VHS Hi-Fi recovers the depth-recorded AFM signal by subtracting the audio head's signal (which contains the AFM signal contaminated by a weak image of the video signal) from the video head's signal (which contains only the video signal), then demodulates the left and right audio channels from their respective frequency carriers. The end result of the complex process is audio of outstanding fidelity, which was uniformly solid across all tape-speeds (EP, LP or SP.) ...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The multi-order response of the tuned secondary circuit of a Tesla transformer, following impulse excitation from its tuned primary circuit, is presented and analysed at the fundamental resonant frequency and at higher-order mode frequencies. A novel way of modifying the frequency response of the secondary coil is then investigated by utilising a technique normally applied {{to the design of}} a certain type of filter known as a helical filter. In general, these are used in radio and microwave frequency circuits in order to pass certain frequencies with little attenuation whilst significantly attenuating other frequencies. Design techniques, developed over several decades, modify and optimise the performance of such filters. The frequency response of the helical filter is modified by altering the geometry of the helical resonator component therein, which is typically {{in the form of an}} air-cored single-layer solenoid. A Tesla transformer whose secondary is constructed to be some form of single-layer solenoidal winding resonates at its designed frequency - its fundamental mode - but also at non-integer harmonics (higher-order anharmonic frequencies, also known as overtones). Those multi-order oscillatory voltages and currents energised in the secondary circuit have been identified and measured and research has determined the fundamental and higher-order mode frequencies and amplitudes for various experimental secondary winding configurations derived from <b>helical</b> filter design <b>techniques.</b> Applied to the Tesla transformer secondary winding, such techniques lead to a new design with a performance that is improved by the suppression of higher- order anharmonic frequencies whilst imparting little change to the fundamental response. It is anticipated that this feature will lead to Tesla transformers which exhibit enhanced spectral purity and which will be better suited to use in certain pulsed power applications than conventionally wound designs...|$|R
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Intensity-modulated {{radiotherapy}} (IMRT), also using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and <b>helical</b> tomotherapy (HT) <b>techniques,</b> {{has been only}} recently introduced for treating anal cancer patients. We report efficacy and safety HT, and daily image-guided RT (IGRT) for anal cancer. Materials and methods We retrospectively analyzed efficacy and toxicity of HT with or without chemotherapy for anal cancer patients. Local control (LC) and grade 3 or more toxicity rate (CTC-AE v. 4. 0) were the primary endpoints. Overall (OS), disease-free (DFS), and colostomy-free survival (CFS) are also reported. Results Between October 2007 and May 2014, 78 patients were treated. Fifty patients presented a stage II or stage IIIA (UICC 2002), and 33 presented a N 1 - 3 disease. Radiotherapy consisted of 36 Gy (1. 8 Gy/fraction) delivered on the pelvis and on the anal canal, with a sequential boost up to 59. 4 Gy (1. 8 Gy/fraction) delivered to the anal and to nodal gross tumor volumes. Concomitant chemotherapy was delivered in 73 patients, mainly using mitomycin C and 5 -fluorouracil (n[*]=[*] 30) or mitomycin C and capecitabine combination (n[*]=[*] 37). After a median follow-up period of 47 months (range 3 - 75), the five-year LC rate was 83. 8 % (95 % CI 76. 2 - 91. 4 %). Seven patients underwent a colostomy because of local recurrence (n[*]=[*] 5) or pretreatment dysfunction (n[*]=[*] 2). Overall incidence of grade 3 acute toxicity was 24 %, mainly as erythema (n[*]=[*] 15 / 19) or diarrhea (n[*]=[*] 7 / 19). Two patients presented a late grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity (anal incontinence). No grade 4 acute or late toxicity was recorded. Conclusions HT with daily IGRT is efficacious and safe {{in the treatment of}} anal canal cancer patients, and is considered in our department standard of care in this clinical setting...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Plan {{comparisons}} of different irradiation techniques using {{the example of}} anal carcinoma. This is supposed to show whether {{in the course of}} the development or with the use of new techniques, the conformal irradiation of the target volume improved and how the new techniques influenced the strain on the organs at risk. Methods and Materials: A total of 49 treatment plans, using planning CT`s of patients with anal cancer, have been planned and compared with identical contours (Varian Eclipse ®, Tomotherapy®) using a 4 -field box, a photon / electron mixed beam technique with additional electron dose on the groin, intensity-modulated radiotherapy with static fields, beam and <b>helical</b> rotation <b>technique</b> (RapidArc ®, Tomotherapy ®). The target volume (PTV 45) included the primary tumor region an the pelvic and inguinal lymph node region on both sides with a single dose of 1, 8 Gy in 25 fractions up to a dose of 45 Gy. Afterwards a boost (PTV 59, 4) was applied to the primary tumor region and infected lymph nodes consisting of 8 fractions of 1, 8 Gy to a dose of 59, 4 Gy. Results: In relation to the target volume (PTV 45), the dose conformality was improved considerably by the intensity-modulated techniques (conformity index: 1. 26 vs. 2. 6, p= 0, 005, homogeneity index. 1. 06). The mixing technique was an exception, achieving a homogeneity index of only 2. 05. For the organs at risk, the use of advanced intensity-modulated techniques resulted in reduced strain. This reduced the volume of the external genitalia receiving 40 Gy (V 40) from 57 % to 25 % (p= 0, 007). The maximum dose at the femoral head was reduced from 52 Gy to 42, 6 Gy (p= 0, 005). V 30 of the bladder decreased from 93, 1 % to 68, 9 % (p= 0, 047). Especially the Tomotherapy yielded very good results with a reduction to 41, 2 % (p= 0, 005). Compared to the IMRT techniques the photon / electron mixed technique showed a reduced dose to the skin (maximum dose of 48, 3 % compared to 52, 4 %, p= 0, 028) and the external genitalia (V 30 at 33, 2 % compared to 46, 8 %, p= 0, 021). Conclusion: IMRT techniques, in comparison with 3 -D conformal techniques, result in a more conformal coverage of the target volume and reduced strain on the risk organs during the radiotherapy of anal carcinoma. The study showed no relevant differences between the different modern radiation techniques themselves. In some cases, the photon / electron mixed media showed less strain on the external genitalia and the skin. There were no advantages of the 4 -field-box technique in any of the examined parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} assemblies form {{an important}} role in the understanding the machinery of living cells. These assemblies with thickness less than 1000 nm and exhibiting different shapes, size and biochemical states are studied using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The ordered arrays of assemblies such as 2 D crystals of membrane proteins and Helices are first reconstructed to near atomic resolution by image processing of its EM images. High-resolution structures of 2 D crystals and helices using EM are very rare, due to inability of many complexes to form highly ordered arrays. If the proteins are large enough, it can be prepared as single particles and can be studied using EM. Single particle based approach is widely applicable approach for any symmetry and in the range of 0. 1 - 100 MDa molecular weight complexes. This approach has caught up crystallography to reach near atomic resolution after the advancements in electron detector. In single particle approach many identical particles are expected to present on an EM grid and then 3 D structure is calculated from the many views of the same molecule. The quality of the 3 D structure is highly dependent on homogenous preparations of single particles. The aim of this thesis is to determine the structure of molecular assemblies through single particle approach, focusing on their image processing. Also, the single particle based <b>helical</b> image processing <b>techniques,</b> applied to very thin and weakly ordered helical filaments, are also studied. In the methods section (Chapter -), both methods related to conventional single particle reconstruction (SPR) for non-homogenous single particles and single particle based Iterative helical real space reconstruction (IHRSR) approaches are presented. The workflow of semi automated tool chain for SPR applied to heterogeneous sample, from automated particle picking to the final 3 D density maps, is explained. The limitation of IHRSR technique is its dependence on initial guess helical symmetry parameters for the helical filaments. So, determining the helical symmetry by analysis of diffraction the pattern of the helical objects is explained in detail.|$|R
