5|$|After the loss, MacShara {{withdrew from}} the case but Rudzewicz appealed the {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century common {{concepts}} of what should be protected in national parks invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park's establishment faced difficulty in persuading {{the federal government and the}} people of <b>Florida</b> <b>that</b> the subtle and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing to the amount of water present and other environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|By August 15, {{convection}} {{began to}} consolidate around {{the center of}} the system as it passed over the Florida Keys. Early on August16, the system rapidly organized, with a low-level circulation developing roughly 80mi (130km) southwest of Tampa, Florida. Favorable environmental conditions led to the NHC anticipating the system to develop into a tropical depression later that day. Several hours later, the first advisory was issued on Tropical Depression Four. Low wind shear provided an environment that promoted quick development of the cyclone and the storm was forecast to attain tropical storm status within 12 hours. The depression tracked northwest around the periphery of a subtropical ridge to the east. Around 11:00am EDT, the NHC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Claudette in light of information from the NEXRAD Doppler weather radar in Tallahassee, <b>Florida</b> <b>that</b> found winds of 40mph (65km/h) around the center of circulation.|$|E

5|$|Tornado watches {{were issued}} for the Atlantic coast from Pennsylvania to Florida {{at the start}} of the day and {{continued}} through the morning and early afternoon, but tornadoes were forecasted to generally be weaker and more isolated. Despite this, the secondary portion of the outbreak that had begun producing scattered tornadoes throughout the Mid-Atlantic and East Coast regions the previous evening intensified during the early hours of the morning, producing numerous tornadoes in Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Maryland. While most were weak, some of the tornadoes that struck portions of Virginia, New York, and Pennsylvania were strong. Although tornado watches were issued, no tornadoes were spotted in New Jersey or Washington, D.C. In the wake of the tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, widespread flooding hit the Midwest, South, and Eastern Seaboard, with extensive flood and flash flood warnings issued. One particularly damaging and deadly EF3 tornado struck the town of Glade Spring, Virginia very early in the morning, where three people died.
