50|$|It {{was decided}} to make appraisals using a before and after technique. The after value would reflect {{the value of the}} {{property}} after the development rights had been acquired. This was the basic bundle of rights theory: only the right to development was being bought; hence, the after value was theoretically a pure farm. A <b>farm</b> <b>expert,</b> who specialized in appraising farms in New York State and the immediate adjacent states, was hired. It was determined that there were no pure farms on Long Island. The <b>farm</b> <b>expert</b> concluded that the farming of the land in Suffolk County was a holding operation as all of the farmlands had the potential for development for other than farmlands and this potential was reflected in the prices paid for farm land on Long Island. This was no recent occurrence as it had always been thus on Long Island. The farmers were forced out by development from Kings County to Queens County, to Nassau County, and finally to Suffolk County.|$|E

He secured and categorized comparable sales from all these areas and submitted them to us in a brochure which was voluminous. He discarded many of the areas as not being comparable and finally selected sales in northern Massachusetts, in the Connecticut River Valley, the Orange County muck lands and the extensive South Jersey farmlands. All of the properties selected as being comparable had similar soil characteristics, irrigation problems, modes of transportation and growing seasons. If there were any differences, these items were noted and adjusted when the appraiser submitted his appraisal of the farms after development rights were acquired.|$|E

40|$|Typescript (photocopy) [...] Texas A&M UniversityAn {{integrated}} {{expert system}} for farm machinery management, titled Farm-machinery Analysis, Research and Management (FARM), was developed I at the Agricultural Engineering Department of Texas A&M University {{for use on}} personal computers. QuickBASIC 4. 0 and Turbo Prolog 2. 0 were used for system development. A stand alone final product was generated. The objective of the proposed farm machinery management model {{is to determine the}} most cost effective machinery set using logical relations and predicted machinery information against a calendar of events. Unlike other models, timeliness is seen as a requirement instead of a cost. A novel concept is the use of predicted in-soil tractor performance to determine the effective machinery capabilities for performing operations. Input information is presented in the form of either a database or | a knowledge base. User defined good working day probabilities and | machinery availability are used to reflect farmer risk attitude. Only I machinery combinations which meet the time and physical compatibility criteria are considered for cost evaluation. This dissertation delineates the theory behind the models, the underlying assumptions, and the procedures for developing, verifying, testing and validating the expert system. FARM consists of two database management systems, a tractor analysis and an in-soil performance prediction model, a farm machinery selection, scheduling and cost analysis model, and the support functions and programs for proper system operation. The integrated system was supplemented by an extensive set of databases for immediate program use. The models use input information and traction prediction equations. The inputs to the tractor analysis, the in-soil performance prediction and the farm machinery selection, scheduling and cost analysis models include tractor, implement, self-propelled machinery, tire, soil, farm, crop schedule, weather and economic information. The outputs consist of formatted reports, presented in tabular format. The inference engine of the farm machinery management model was designed to combine independent information in order to determine which machinery sets could perform the designated operations in the time available. The only predefined relations were the valid implements for an operation and the valid tractor types for a crop. The associated costs for owning and operating the aforementioned machinery sets were also calculated. A natural language interface experimental expert system was also developed in order to demonstrate how the <b>FARM</b> <b>expert</b> system can become more intelligent and user friendly.

The results were clustered in the following areas: milk analysis, animal health and therapy, animal husbandry and hygiene in the barn, milking machine, milking management and hygiene, feeding, raising of calves, breeding, stress/calmness/welfare and animal-human-relationship. Although all farms had average good somatic cell counts, they could be divideded in two types, differing in management, biography, experience and modernity of barn and milking-parlor. The results indicate that there are individual solutions achieving a low somatic cell count, but it is important that these fit to the farm methods.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a {{framework}} that models farmers’ strategic decision making, taking into account that farmers adapt to institutional changes, given the social structure in which they are embedded. Design/methodology/approach – First, a theoretical framework was developed using the reasoned action approach, innovation diffusion research, identity research, and the theory of structuration. Second, the framework was refined based on insights gained through semi-structured interviews with seven pork farmers and six pork <b>farming</b> <b>experts</b> on innovation decisions in general and added-value market adoption in particular. Findings – The farmer decision-making framework distinguishes personal characteristics, social influence related to reference groups, and the institutional context that determines the space for manoeuvre. The interviews reveal the importance of context specific factors, such as trust in policy and market requirements, and point at general mechanisms of path dependency as a result of previous decision making and social influence related to identity reference groups. Originality/value – The authors include feedback mechanisms between on the one hand social structure and institutional context, and on the other, farmer decision making.

40|$|In Africa, the unsustainable, illegal {{hunting of}} wild animals for food, {{commonly}} referred to as the bushmeat crisis, causes multiple problems for ecosystems and human health. Given the lack of management of bushmeat hunting and rapidly expanding human population densities, the potential for overharvesting, driving populations of native species to local extinction, is of major concern unless effective and feasible alternatives can be developed. The farming of desirable native species offers one solution to reducing the demand for bushmeat, but farms must be economically viable, environmentally sustainable, and socially acceptable. This research uses Geographic Information Systems to examine the feasibility of establishing large native rodent (Thyronomys swinderianus) farms in Kenya. Given their high protein content, these rodents, commonly known as grasscutters, are a highly sought bushmeat species and have been successfully farmed in West and Central Africa. I performed an extensive literature review and consulted with grasscutter and sustainable livestock <b>farm</b> <b>experts</b> located in sub-Saharan Africa to determine physical and socio-political geographic factors most likely to constrain the development of sustainable grasscutter farms in Kenya, before using ArcGIS to map these criteria and a weighted overlay analysis to identify potentially favorable locations for establishing future farms. These maps identified three suitable geographic locations: the Western and Nyanza provinces; the Central province; and the southeastern tip of the Coastal province. The majority of Kenya reflects moderately suitable locations that are feasible for establishment as grasscutters are adaptive, low-intensity livestock, and previous studies have identified some of these moderately suitable locations as accepted livestock centers. These results are encouraging for the implementation of sustainable grasscutter farming in Kenya and the diversification of protein sources and economic development opportunities for rural dwellers. While the maps created are specific to Kenya, the methodology developed in this study is useful to global stakeholders attempting to alleviate the bushmeat crisis, combat food insecurity in a sustainable manner, and/or provide means of economic development to developing countries...|$|R

40|$|Diffuse {{pollution}} of watercourses from agriculture represents {{a complex and}} persistent environmental problem in the UK. This paper provides insights into why UK policy interventions have had limited success to date, drawing on the disciplines of psychology, sociology and behavioural economics to more thoroughly understand farmer attitudes and behaviours towards pollution mitigation. Our analysis is based on eliciting the opinions of commercial farmers {{through a series of}} surveys and discussion groups in three catchments: the grassland dominated River Eden catchment; the arable dominated River Wensum catchment and the mixed farming area of the Hampshire River Avon catchment. Results strongly suggest that a fundamental shift in identities, normative behavioural beliefs and social norms is required within the farming community before mitigation behaviours become embedded. Simply offering financial incentives or imposing regulatory penalties is unlikely to achieve the desired results. Double loop learning has the potential to enable farmers to migrate from a productivist to a multifunctional outlook where pollution mitigation becomes internalised within a <b>farm</b> management system. <b>Expert</b> <b>farm</b> advisors will be required to facilitate this process.

A technical coefficient generator (TechnoGIN) was used to assess current (maize, beans, soybean and grass seed) and alternative (castor bean and sunflower) crops grown with current and alternative production techniques. The quantification of the inputs and outputs was based on <b>farm</b> surveys, <b>expert</b> knowledge, literature and field experiments. Although castor bean and sunflower are economically competitive with maize in Montes Claros, feed and labour requirements may hinder farmers' adoption. In Chapada Gaúcha, the double cropping system soybean/sunflower presented small economic gains when compared to soybean; it also increased nitrogen losses and biocide residues. We conclude that the scope for alternative and sustainable biodiesel crops on family farms is limited. Their economic benefits are small or absent, while their introduction can lead to higher environmental impacts and there may be trade-offs with food and feed availability at the farm level...|$|R

40|$|As in {{many other}} regions in the world, Caribbean women play a vital if under-recognized and {{unsupported}} role in food production. They {{are less likely to}} have access to land, extension training, affordable credit and loans than men, yet studies indicate that they make up to 65 % of agricultural production and 80 % of marketing decisions. There is a growing market for organic products, and an increasing number of Caribbean women are becoming interested in organic farming methods. Organic farming is highly knowledge-intensive, however, and women farmers often lack the means to learn more about organic production methods. While opportunities exist to tap into local and even regional markets, women farmers tend to be isolated from market information, and are not producing to organic export standards. A number of women farmers would like to make this leap but lack the opportunities to do so. To overcome these challenges, Networked Intelligence for Development (NID), an NGO based in Toronto, Canada, organized a workshop in collaboration with the Jamaica Organic Agriculture Movement (JOAM) for Caribbean women engaged in organic farming with a view to help them take advantage of the Internet as a means to access and exchange information about organic farming methods, promote their business, and market their products. Held in March 2004 in Jamaica, the workshop attracted 47 women from all over the region, 28 of whom ran their own farming businesses. The workshop started with a basic training course {{on the use of the}} Internet, service providers and email services, and concluded with a session on e-commerce and online payment transactions. A Yahoo account was set up for everyone, including those who already had an email address, so they too learned how to set up an account. The participants also learned how to use search engines, how to download software from the web, how to create a web page, why a web presence is important, and how to go about getting web design services. The course also included an exploration of the kinds of organic farming information and networks that already exist on the Internet, and training in how to set up and participate in an online user group. All of the women who registered for the workshop completed the course, which also included a field trip to three organic <b>farms,</b> <b>expert</b> presentations on marketing and financing and, on the last day, a brainstorming session in which the participants suggested establishing a regional network of women organic farmers.
