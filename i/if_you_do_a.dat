500|$|The {{publicity}} {{stemming from}} this incident was {{the impetus for}} Google contributing to the Chilling Effects archive, which archives legal threats of all sorts made against Internet users and Internet sites. Chilling Effects contains the original complaint letter from the law firm used by the Church of Scientology, Moxon & Kobrin.Google provided {{a copy of the}} letter from law firm Moxon & Kobrin to online rights watchdog Chilling Effects, a joint project of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley, and University of San Francisco law school clinics. Helena Kobrin, lawyer for the Church of Scientology, stated she took offense at the name of the Web site, saying: [...] "It implies that the First Amendment gives people some special right to infringe copyrights." [...] Sergey Brin and Larry Page were both questioned on Google's response to the Church of Scientology's complaints in a 2004 interview in Playboy Magazine, and they appreciated Chilling Effects as a [...] "nice compromise". Brin explained the new scenario: [...] "So now, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> generic search on Scientology, you get a link to a site that discusses the legal aspects of why the anti-Scientology site isn't listed." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E

Her stuff, that she makes, I think, is silly and very soon her career will wither away and disappear." [...] Lena responded to this interview via her YouTube Page, [...] "I saw Yulia's interview. Of course I got upset. But I want to tell everybody that I have a completely opposite attitude towards the whole situation, Yulia's project included. I believe she's a very talented person and I sincerely hope that she'll be successful in all the things she plans." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There is what {{is called}} an {{affinity}} between quicksilver and gold. The moment gold touches quicksilver it is absorbed by it, just as {{a drop of water}} is taken up by a lump of salt. It thickens the quicksilver, and as it is squeezed through the leather the quicksilver is as it were strained out, and what remains behind becomes thicker and thicker, until, as you see, it is almost solid. It is no good to use more pressure, for <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> certain amount of the gold would be squeezed through the leather. You see, as the stuff in the cradle is shaken, the gold being heavier than the sand finds its way down to the bottom, and every particle that comes in contact with the quicksilver is swallowed up by it." ...|$|E

I'm sure you've got any amount of stuff in you, though you look--well, as if you'd lived all your life in a garden." [...] She sat up, and began to explain with animation. [...] "I belong to a club in London. It meets every Saturday, so it's called the Saturday Club. We're {{supposed}} to talk about art, but I'm sick of talking about art--what's the good of it? With all kinds of real things going on round one? It isn't as if they'd got {{anything to say about}} art, either. So what I'm going to tell 'em is that we've talked enough about art, and we'd better talk about life for a change. Questions that really matter to people's lives, the White Slave Traffic, Women Suffrage, the Insurance Bill, and so on. And when we've made up our mind {{what we want to do}} we could form ourselves into a society for doing it. [...] . I'm certain that if people like ourselves were to take things in hand instead of leaving it to policemen and magistrates, we could put a stop to--prostitution"--she lowered her voice at the ugly word--"in six months. My idea is that men and women ought to join in these matters. We ought to go into Piccadilly and stop one of these poor wretches and say: 'Now, look here, I'm no better than you are, and I don't pretend to be any better, but you're doing what you know to be beastly, and I won't have you doing beastly things, because we're all the same under our skins, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> beastly thing it does matter to me.'

5000|$|Interference {{is known}} as 'pulsating brakes' which may occur when braking while also having the turn {{indicator}} flashing.

Be aware that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> completely separate wiring the brake ground must be separated from the lighting ground.

If a manager or engineer claims that there were not any problems with the project, they will be reminded that “no problem is a problem” - in other words, you have not objectively and critically evaluated the project to find opportunities for improvement. No problems indicate that you did not stretch to meet (or exceed) your expected capacity.|$|E

It’s many {{tens of millions of}} dollars to get to a first product and $50 million to get to profits. That’s very difficult to do because investors want an exit some multiple over that investment. I am hoping we return to the days of frequent IPOs and get beyond the fire-sale acquisitions. That’s not what you can see right now. If it’s a programmable chip, the cost is even more." ...|$|E
