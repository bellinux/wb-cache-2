Henderson is a person with dwarfism from England, who was badly injured by being tossed by a rugby fan in a bar. The speech by Dinklage brought media and public attention to the act of dwarf-tossing with Henderson's name being trended worldwide on social media.

He later explained that 20 years earlier he might have accepted these offers but that he's a [...] "little bit more at peace with things now and I—said what I wanted to say.

2500|$|Author Roger Ray {{thoroughly}} researched Josephine's {{story about}} joining the theater company and found many inconsistencies. [...] The Markham troupe was documented as leaving San Francisco {{on board the}} Southern Pacific Railroad, not a ship nor a stagecoach, in October 1879 for Casa Grande, Arizona, {{the end of the}} line. Josephine or Sadie Marcus’s name was never included among those on the Markham troupe’s rolls in 1879. The Yuma Arizona Sentinel reported on October 25, 1879, [...] "Tuesday arrived a Pinafore Company for Tucson, composed of Misses Pauline Markham, Mary Bell, Belle Howard, and Mrs. Pring, and Messrs. Borabeck and McMahon." [...] From Yuma, the troupe took a stagecoach to Tucson, not Prescott. The train trip was not interrupted by Indians. Ray says that Josephine didn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> named Dora Hirsch. Her real name was Leah Hirschberg, whose mother was a music teacher. This family lived only a few blocks from where Josephine lived with her family. But Leah never left San Francisco with Josephine. She enjoyed some brief success as a juvenile actress on the San Francisco stage during the 1870s.|$|E

The emotional, rather rootless life of the Russians appealed to her. She {{did not want to}} go to Paris. Paris was dry, and essentially boring.
