500|$|Andrew Garfield {{believes}} {{the story of}} Never Let Me Go is about humans, and exploring [...] "what {{it is to have}} a soul, and how you prove what a soul is"; he says he enjoys the way the film is a [...] "call to arms" [...] about the positives of life. He adds that its message could hopefully remind people that they have a choice when they arise in the morning whether to pursue their own choice of activities for the day, or to do what they should do or are obliged to do. Keira Knightley feels that the film's story is alarming, but has said that the film is [...] "more about humanity's ability to look the other way". [...] "You know in fact that if your morals can go out the window <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can survive in a certain way, whatever your morals may be".|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to {{his role in the}} television series, Dale's comic book counterpart is among the longest surviving characters in the series, and he enters into a sexual relationship with Andrea. Kirkman asserted that it was necessary for writers to distance the development of Dale's television character from that in the comic: [...] "I have talked many times how much I like the difference between the comics and the show. There are going to be big plot lines that we may not necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> really want to read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up. The show {{is always going to be}} a different animal and the decision to kill Dale off was a big one and it wasn't one that was made lightly." ...|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. {{requested}} {{in press}} releases that critics {{not discuss the}} film's ending. Richard Schickel of Time magazine disregarded the request and revealed Rusty's innocence in his review. He wrote, [...] "Carolyn's murderer has an excellent motive both for killing her... But {{it is hard to}} accept the possibility that the real perpetrator would leave his escape from the trap entirely to chance." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel surmised, [...] "It's not that Warner Bros. is actually concerned that reviewers will tip the solution to the murder mystery. It's that the studio wants to further the impression that the movie is full of surprises." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "Even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> know what the solution is, the performances are so clever and the screenplay... is so subtle that it could well turn out that your expectations are wrong." ...|$|E

2500|$|Furtwängler {{refused to}} {{participate}} in the propaganda film Philharmoniker. Goebbels wanted Furtwängler to feature in it, but Furtwängler declined to take part. The film was finished in December 1943 showing many conductors connected with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, including [...] Eugen Jochum, Karl Böhm, Hans Knappertsbusch, and [...] Richard Strauss, but not Furtwängler. [...] Goebbels also asked Furtwängler to direct the music in a film about Beethoven, again for propaganda purposes. They quarralled violently about this project. Furtwängler told him [...] "You are wrong, Herr Minister, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can exploit Beethoven in a film." [...] Goebbels gave up his plans for the film.|$|E

Once school is back in session, every junior high school class in America should take {{a field trip to}} see this movie." [...] Joe Morgenstern, writing for The Wall Street Journal, wrote: [...] "At its best, Ava DuVernay's biographical film honors Dr. King's legacy by dramatizing the racist brutality that spurred him and his colleagues to action." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times praised the acting, directing, writing, and cinematography, and wrote: [...] "Even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> know what's coming, Selma hums with suspense and surprise.
