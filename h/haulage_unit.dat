40|$|A large {{proportion}} of sugarcane harvested in the South African sugar industry is hauled by tractorltrailer units on gravel hardened roads. Queries from sugarcane growers prompted an investigation {{to determine whether the}} performance of a <b>haulage</b> <b>unit</b> would be affected if different tractor rear wheel tyres were used. Radial-ply tyres of 34 inches rim diameter, and cross-ply types of 30 inches and 34 inches rim diameter were tested on the same tractor. Road speed, loads, fuel consumption and wheelslip were measured over a 4, 3 km route divided into a series of gradients where the distances for each gradient were known. With the smaller diameter tyres the tractor rear wheels tended to slip more on the steeper gradients. The tests showed that when the three different tyres were used {{there were no significant differences}} in the performance of the <b>haulage</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E

40|$|Due to {{operational}} {{advantage of}} dragline in simultaneous excavation and back-filling, the equipment has gained vast importance in open-pit mining. Besides, absence of auxiliary <b>haulage</b> <b>units</b> and {{a myriad of}} other benefits are also credited in favor of excavation of muck piles by the draglines. However, the aspects of production, productivity and economics are of utmost significance in dragline operation and planning. In this light, the present paper is an endeavor to analyze availability and utilization of dragline operations. The paper presents {{a good amount of}} data for 4 -draglines operating in one of the major opencast projects in India. The study reveals the trends of availability and utilization of these draglines during last 11 -years. Furthermore, the study also highlights the salient reasons for loss of available hours and for idling of the draglines. Some startling information and facts have been illustrated in form of graphs and pie charts...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find the adequate number of cane <b>haulage</b> (transport) <b>units,</b> as a function of grade ability (ability to go up slope). The study was conducted at New Halfa Sugar Factory, with a cane crushing rate of 5000 tons/day. A 150 hp tractor was used on 1 km hauling route as the most critical grade from the second main center up to the unloading platform. The route was divided into four sections with different grades. The grade of each section was measured with surveying equipment. The road combined resistance, that has to be overcome by the hauling unit, is the sum of the route grade and the coefficient of rolling resistance. As per literature, the coefficient of rolling resistance is assumed to be 0. 02 for all sections. The tractor was run on different gear meshes to determine its grade ability at different speeds. The total operation time, function of gear mesh and road combined resistance were determined and used to calculate hauling unit production rate. The factory crushing rate was divided by the hauling unit production rate to get the number of hauling units. Two replicates (route conditions) were used; namely, treated (stabilized) and non-treated. As a result, the required number of hauling units was 5 and 6 for treated and non-treated routes, respectively. Out of 36 gears in the tractor gear box, the number of gears actually used was 2 and 3 for treated and non - treated routes, respectively. This makes the use of tractor with standard gear box in cane hauling questionable; a simple gear box with three or four gear may suffice. The study recommends that similar studies should be conducted at other sugarcane factories, with different route conditions and crushing rates; and that the grade ability index be included in tractor test code...|$|R

50|$|A {{small number}} of {{left-hand-drive}} Atkinsons were built for export to mainland Europe in the late 1960s, with pressed-steel cabs bought from Krupp after that company had ceased commercial vehicle production. Most were sold eventually in the U.K., via Comberhill Commercials of Wakefield. A different design of glass-fibre cab, launched in prototype form at the 1966 Commercial Motor Show, and named View-Line, had a deep single-piece main windscreen with wrap-around quarter glasses. The prototype had three separate chrome radiator grilles, but lacked {{the character of the}} exposed radiator models. Thereafter, although the Krupp Cabs, introduced in 1969, and View-Line cabs had concealed radiators, they carried a fibreglass replica of the Atkinson radiator outline with the 'Big A' device centred upon it. Both were available until 1970 and the merger with Seddon. Notable Atkinsons of the era were a fleet of 6x6 gritters built in 1962-73 on the orders of various U.K. highway authorities for use on the motorway network. These had Cummins NHK engines installed, rather than the more popular Gardner power units, due ostensibly to the use of steel in their construction, which didn't suffer salt corrosion to the same degree as the alloy-constructed Gardners. Early examples had AEC engines.From 1968 the standard Mk I glass-fibre clad cab was revised, with stronger ash framing, larger dimensions and wider, deeper windscreens. The traditional Withnell-tubed, exposed radiator was replaced with the more imposing enclosed version, which was concealed behind a glass-fibre shrounded metal grille - again carrying the Knight's Head, circular A logo and additional adornments in the form of engine manufacturer plates.This cab featured on the final Atkinson haulage models, the naming of which originated from an idea by Frank Whalley, the company publicity officer at the time. The most famous of the range were Two-axle tractor units were carried the name 'Borderer'. Three-axle rear-steer tractor units carried the name 'Leader'. Three-axle haulage chassis carried the name 'Searcher'. Four-axle chassis carried the name 'Defender'. Three-axle heavy <b>haulage</b> tractor <b>units</b> carried the name 'Venturer'. The two-axle haulage chassis were never given an official name, but was planned to carry the name 'Raider', although factory grille plates were never produced for this model.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{removal of}} {{overlying}} waste rock in open pit mines to dumps is conventionally undertaken by draglines or by trucks and shovels, or {{by a combination}} of these. Waste rock dumps are the largest remnant structures of open cut mining operations and can absorb {{a large proportion of the}} mine operating costs. If the dumps are not properly developed they can be excessively expensive and can become a major safety risk and environmental hazard. There are many examples worldwide where poor design and construction of waste rock dumps have resulted in failures causing considerable loss of life and widespread damage, or have resulted in erosion and seepage that have led to severe environmental pollution. The proper design and scheduling of waste rock dumps and haul routes can significantly reduce costs, minimise the possibility of failures, and avoid harming the environment. This Thesis is limited to the consideration of trucks and shovels for waste rock haulage in open cut mining operations. It describes the development and application of a waste rock dump scheduling model using the Operations Research technique of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming, implemented in the mathematical modelling language AMPL. The model focuses on minimising the haulage cost for each block of waste rock taken from the open pit and placed in the dump. Allowance is made for the selective placement of benign and reactive waste rock, based on an open pit block model that delineates benign and reactive waste rock. The formulation requires input data including the xyz-coordinates of the block model for the open pit, information on whether the waste rock blocks are benign or reactive, the proposed time scheduling of waste rock haulage from the open pit, <b>unit</b> <b>haulage</b> costs, and the geometry of the waste rock dump, including the delineation of the zones that are benign and those that are reactive. The model was successfully tested by using both simple test data and actual mine site data. The application of the model to a simple case confirmed that it produces results that meet the Objective Function in producing an optimal haulage time and cost, and meets the various Constraints imposed. This model for scheduling the removal of waste rock from open cut mining operations with trucks and shovels will require further research and testing and, because the results are generated in a numerical format, there will also be a need to convert them to a graphical format to facilitate their interpretation. Ultimately, it will have the potential to provide a relatively low-cost scheduling tool that meets operators’ economic, safety and environmental goals...|$|R
