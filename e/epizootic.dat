5|$|Red foxes are {{not readily}} prone to {{infestation}} with fleas. Species like Spilopsyllus cuniculi are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like Archaeopsylla erinacei are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalides canis and Paraceras melis. Ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and I.hexagonus {{are not uncommon}} in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The louse Trichodectes vulpis specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei {{is the most important}} cause of mange in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting {{from the base of the}} tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the <b>epizootic</b> phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include Demodex folliculorum, Notoderes, Otodectes cynotis (which is frequently found in the ear canal), Linguatula serrata (which infects the nasal passages) and ringworms.|$|E

25|$|Between 1888 and 1892, {{northern}} Ethiopia {{experienced a}} devastating famine. The famine {{was caused by}} rinderpest that killed the majority of all cattle (see 1890s African rinderpest <b>epizootic).</b> Conditions worsened with cholera outbreaks (1889–92), a typhus epidemic, and a major smallpox epidemic (1889–90).|$|E
25|$|A British and Irish {{inquiry into}} BSE {{concluded}} the <b>epizootic</b> {{was caused by}} cattle, which are normally herbivores, being fed the remains of other cattle {{in the form of}} meat and bone meal (MBM), a protein supplement in concentrated feeds. Since dairy calves are generally fed concentrated feed after they are weaned, they usually develop this disease more often than beef cattle.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} two <b>epizootics</b> of high mortalities from infection with Streptococcus agalactiae, occurring in captive rays held in a marine display aquarium in south-east Queensland, Australia, in 2009 and 2010. Five different species of rays were affected, including mangrove whiprays (Himantura granulata), estuary rays (Dasyatis fluviorum), eastern shovelnose rays (Aptychotrema rostrata), white-spotted eagle rays (Aetobatus narinari) and blue-spotted mask rays (Neotrygon kuhlii). This report describes the history of both <b>epizootics</b> including collection, quarantine and husbandry of rays, the disease <b>epizootics,</b> clinico-pathological features of the disease, antimicrobial therapy, autogenous vaccine production, and laboratory studies including clinical and histopathology, bacteriology, PCR, molecular serotyping and sequencing of the bacterium S.  agalactiae...|$|R

25|$|The US has {{had nine}} FMD {{outbreaks}} {{since it was}} first recognized on the northeastern coast in 1870; the most devastating happened in 1914. It originated from Michigan, but its entry into the stockyards in Chicago turned it into an <b>epizootic.</b> About 3,500 livestock herds were infected across the US, totaling over 170,000 cattle, sheep, and swine.

5|$|<b>Epizootics</b> are {{outbreaks}} (epidemics) {{of disease}} among non-human animals. During the 20th century significant <b>epizootics</b> of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest of cattle, avian and swine influenza, swine fever and bluetongue of sheep.

Then they passed the bacillus through rabbits, weakening it and obtaining a vaccine. Pasteur and Thuillier incorrectly described the bacterium as a figure-eight shape. Roux described the bacterium as stick-shaped in 1884.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} Dutch Republic, {{the only other}} regions where {{inoculation}} was used to any significant level were northern Germany and Denmark. Experiments started in Mecklenburg during the <b>epizootic</b> of the late 1770s. 'Insurance companies' were created which provided inoculation in special 'institutes'. Although these were private initiatives, they were created with full encouragement from the authorities. Even though neighboring states followed this practice with interest, the practice never caught on outside of Mecklenburg; many were still opposed to inoculation.|$|E
25|$|In total, 52 {{parasite}} {{species are}} {{registered in the}} round goby in the native area. Most abundant parasites of the Black-Sea round goby are metacercariae of trematodes of Heterophyidae family, such as Cryptocotyle concavum, C. lingua, and Pygidiopsis genata. The trematodes C. lingua and P. genata can infest human. In the 1950s, {{along the coast of}} the Gulf of Taganrog (Sea of Azov) the round goby was registered as a host of <b>epizootic</b> of nematodes, Tetrameres fissispina and Streptocara crassicauda, which were fatal to ducklings.|$|E
40|$|Respiratory tract infections with {{viruses and}} Pasteurella spp. were {{determined}} sequentially among 26 cattle that died during two severe <b>epizootics</b> of shipping fever pneumonia. Nasal swab and serum {{samples were collected}} prior to onset of the <b>epizootics,</b> during disease progression, and after death, when necropsies were performed and lung samples were collected. Eighteen normal control cattle also were sampled {{at the beginning of}} the <b>epizootics</b> as well as at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. Respiratory bovine coronaviruses (RBCV) were isolated from nasal secretions of 21 and 25 cattle before and after transport. Two and 17 cattle nasally shed Pasteurella spp. before and after transport, respectively. RBCV were isolated at titers of 1 × 103 to 1. 2 × 107 PFU per g of lung tissue from 18 cattle that died within 7 days of the <b>epizootics,</b> but not from the lungs of the remaining cattle that died on days 9 to 36. Twenty-five of the 26 lung samples were positive for Pasteurella spp., and their CFU ranged between 4. 0 × 105 and 2. 3 × 109 per g. Acute and subacute exudative, necrotizing lobar pneumonia characterized the lung lesions of these cattle with a majority of pneumonic lung lobes exhibiting fibronecrotic and exudative changes typical of pneumonic pasteurellosis, but other lung lobules had histological changes consisting of bronchiolitis and alveolitis typical of virus-induced changes. These cattle were immunologically naive to both infectious agents at the onset of the <b>epizootics,</b> but those that died after day 7 had rising antibody titers against RBCV and Pasteurella haemolytica. In contrast, the 18 clinically normal and RBCV isolation-negative cattle had high hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titers to RBCV from the beginning, while their antibody responses to P. haemolytica antigens were delayed. Evans' criteria for causation were applied to our findings because of the multifactorial nature of shipping fever pneumonia. This analysis identified RBCV as the primary inciting cause in these two <b>epizootics.</b> These viruses were previously not recognized as a causative agent in this complex respiratory tract disease of cattle...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} role of horses as {{amplification}} hosts during the 1993 and 1996 Mexican Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) <b>epizootics,</b> we subcutaneously infected 10 horses by using four different equine isolates. Most horses showed little or no disease and low or nonexistent viremia. Neurologic disease developed in only 1 horse, and brain histopathologic examination showed meningeal lymphocytic infiltration, perivascular cuffing, and focal encephalitis. Three animals showed mild meningoencephalitis without clinical disease. Viral RNA was detected in the brain of several animals 12 - 14 days after infection. These {{data suggest that the}} duration and scope of the recent Mexican <b>epizootics</b> were limited by lack of equine amplification characteristic of previous, more extensive VEE outbreaks. The Mexican <b>epizootics</b> may have resulted from the circulation of a more equine-neurotropic, subtype IE virus strain or from increased transmission to horses due to amplification by other vertebrate hosts or transmission by more competent mosquito vectors...|$|R
40|$|The devastating affects {{of disease}} on European {{freshwater}} crayfish {{are well known}} as <b>epizootics</b> in wild populations have occurred throughout much of Europe since the mid XVIIIe s. After protracted and rigorous debate, {{the cause of the}} disease named crayfish plague was proved to be the fungus Aphanomyces astaci in 1934. In the last 70 years, much of the research conducted in the field of crayfish pathology has concentrated on fungi, especially improving diagnostic techniques for A. astaci. Similarly, diagnostic responses to <b>epizootics</b> in European crayfish have concentrated almost entirely on fungal isolation and/or identification. On the other hand, viruses have proved {{to be the most important}} pathogens in the growing global crustacean aquaculture and fishery industries. Rickettsia-like organisms (RLO) are also important. Critically, diagnostic techniques necessary to detect the full range of potential pathogens of crayfish are rarely utilized in the field of crayfish pathology in Europe. Histopathological analysis, required for the diagnosis of infections by viruses and RLOs, is absent from most European studies. <b>Epizootics</b> unrelated to A. astaci in European crayfish and <b>epizootics</b> in introduced American crayfish species highlight the inadequate current state of knowledge in the field. Presently, the field is ill-equipped to determine the cause(s) of these <b>epizootics.</b> Moreover, crayfish conservation strategies may be undermined and even detrimental to the longterm goals; eg., stocking programs may spread undetected pathogens. Therefore, critical limitations in the field of crayfish pathology have major repercussions in management of freshwater crayfish. Guiding principles and a concept for a trans-European Community research and education program were developed to address this serious issue and are presented herein...|$|R
25|$|Widespread {{eradication}} efforts {{took place}} {{as soon as}} the early 1900s; in 1924, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) was formed in response to rinderpest. Until the mid-1900s, eradication efforts largely took place on an individual country basis, using vaccination campaigns. In 1950, the Inter-African Bureau of <b>Epizootic</b> Diseases was formed, with the stated goal of eliminating rinderpest from Africa. During the 1960s, a program called JP 15 attempted to vaccinate all cattle in participating countries; by 1979, only one of the countries involved, Sudan, reported cases of rinderpest.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} infections {{of humans}} by H5N1 coincided with an <b>epizootic</b> (an epidemic in nonhumans) of H5N1 influenza in Hong Kong's poultry population in 1997.

25|$|For {{many of the}} vCJD patients, direct {{evidence}} exists that they had consumed tainted beef, and this {{is assumed to be}} the mechanism by which all affected individuals contracted it. Disease incidence also appears to correlate with slaughtering practices that led to the mixture of nervous system tissue with ground meat (mince) and other beef. An estimated 400,000 cattle infected with BSE entered the human food chain in the 1980s. Although the BSE <b>epizootic</b> was eventually brought under control by culling all suspect cattle populations, people are still being diagnosed with vCJD each year (though the number of new cases currently has dropped to fewer than five per year). This is attributed to the long incubation period for prion diseases, which is typically measured in years or decades. As a result, {{the full extent of the}} human vCJD outbreak is still not known.|$|E
25|$|Cattle plagues recurred {{throughout}} history, often accompanying {{wars and}} military campaigns. They hit Europe especially {{hard in the}} 18th century, with three long panzootics which, although varying in intensity and duration from region to region, {{took place in the}} periods of 1709–1720, 1742–1760, and 1768–1786. There was a major outbreak covering the whole of Britain in 1865/66. Later in history, an outbreak in the 1890s killed 80 to 90% of all cattle in southern Africa, {{as well as in the}} Horn of Africa. Sir Arnold Theiler was instrumental in developing a vaccine that curbed the <b>epizootic.</b> More recently, a rinderpest outbreak raged across much of Africa in 1982–1984, costing at least an estimated US$500 million in stock losses. The loss of animals caused famine which depopulated subsaharan Africa, allowing thornbush to colonise. This formed ideal habitat for tsetse fly, which carries sleeping sickness. Much of the land remains depopulated, under the control of the tsetse fly.|$|E
25|$|Disease {{has also}} been a factor in the {{survival}} of the western lowland gorilla. The Ebola <b>epizootic</b> in western and central Africa has caused more than 90% mortality rate in western lowland gorillas. From 2003–2004, two epizootics infected the western lowland gorilla, which caused two thirds of their population to disappear. The outbreak was monitored in the Republic of Congo by Magdalena Bermejo and other field-based primatologists, as it also spread to humans through contact with bushmeat. The catastrophe led the World Conservation Union to designate the western lowland gorilla a critically endangered species. Malaria is also an issue that has been arising for the western lowland gorillas. Out of 51 faecal samples from habituated individuals, 25 were shown to have Plasmodium DNA. Laverania, which is a sub-genus of the Plasmodium genus of parasitic protozoa, was found in these studies. Varying exposure to different Anopheles mosquitoes transmitting Plasmodium species is known to be the origin of malaria in western lowland gorillas.|$|E

40|$|A 16 -month seroepizootiologic {{study of}} bovine {{respiratory}} syncytial virus (BRSV) infection was conducted in a dairy herd. Results indicated that antibodies to BRSV present in serum from newborn calves were derived through the ingestion of colostrum. This passive immunity in calves became undetectable in an average of 99 days (SD = 36. 5; range = 30 to 208 days). Two <b>epizootics</b> of respiratory tract disease occurred during the study period, and an association with BRSV was demonstrated in both <b>epizootics.</b> In the 2 <b>epizootics,</b> clinical signs of respiratory tract disease were only mildly to moderately severe, with no mortality or evidence of chronic pneumonia occurring. Seemingly, the passive immunity failed to protect calves from infection and disease caused by BRSV. Additionally, {{it was observed that}} if active immunity was induced by infection with BRSV, this immunity protected from the development of clinical disease, but not from reinfection upon subsequent exposures to BRSV...|$|R
40|$|Simian {{varicella}} virus (SVV) {{causes a}} natural erythematous disease in Old World monkeys and {{is responsible for}} simian varicella <b>epizootics</b> that occur sporadically in facilities housing nonhuman primates. This review summarizes the biology of SVV and simian varicella as a veterinary disease of nonhuman primates. SVV {{is closely related to}} varicella–zoster virus, the causative agent of human varicella and herpes zoster. Clinical signs of simian varicella include fever, vesicular skin rash, and hepatitis. Simian varicella may range from a mild infection to a severe and life-threatening disease, and <b>epizootics</b> may have high morbidity and mortality rates. SVV establishes a lifelong latent infection in neural ganglia of animals in which the primary disease resolves, and the virus may reactivate later in life to cause a secondary disease corresponding to herpes zoster. Prompt diagnosis is important for control and prevention of <b>epizootics.</b> Antiviral treatment for simian varicella may be effective if administered early in the course of infection...|$|R
