50|$|After {{the abrupt}} {{disappearance}} of Pater Pan, Sunshine leaves Edoku with a wealthy Child of Fortune named Guy Vlad Boca. They sample the hedonistic {{life of the}} Honored Passengers aboard the <b>interstellar</b> <b>Void</b> Ships and eventually arrive on the planet Belshazaar.|$|E
5000|$|A {{water-based}} race {{who were}} considered extinct for 10,000 {{years after the}} war with the faeros/hydrogues, but in fact were broken up and dispersed throughout the <b>interstellar</b> <b>void.</b> Whilst wentals are unable to die, they can be [...] "disassociated" [...] into their more basic components, nullifying their sentience and thus putting them in a form of suspended animation. Like the verdani, they have some kind of telepathic link and speak as one.|$|E
5000|$|The Grubs are a spacefaring civilization. They {{are named}} [...] "grubs" [...] by humans {{due to their}} general appearance. When they first {{developed}} starships, they were nearly exterminated by the Inhibitors. Some survived by hiding in the <b>interstellar</b> <b>void,</b> adapting themselves to near absolute zero conditions to avoid detection. During that time, some of them encountered the Nestbuilders and the Jumper Clowns, and received technology from them, including FTL communication (but not travel).|$|E
40|$|From {{the point}} of view of {{radiation}} safety, interstellar space is not an empty <b>void.</b> <b>Interstellar</b> gas and cosmic rays, which consist of hydrogen and helium nucleons, present a severe radiation hazard to crew and electronics aboard a relativistic interstellar ship. Of the two, the oncoming relativistic flow of interstellar gas produces the most intence radiation. A protection shield will be needed to block relativistic interstellar gas that can also absorb most of the cosmic rays which, as a result of relativistic aberration, form into a beamed flow propagating toward the front of the ship.

5000|$|Guitarist Robby Baca explained, [...] The three Exoplanet tracks {{represent}} {{the focal point}} of the album's concept, musically the songs are tied together somehow to show that they are a part of a time line. That’s why — if you listen closely — there are repeated musical ideas throughout. These three tracks are the definitive songs of the album. Part one is a journey outside our solar system. Part two is a journey in between galaxies (<b>interstellar</b> <b>void)</b> and part three is the colonization and failure of human life on another planet. The songs were not originally meant to be consecutive and tied together, but that’s how everything came together, and we rolled with it.|$|E
