30|$|Clinical {{information}} and plain radiographs {{of the knee}} joint were evaluated for 276 consecutive patients (438 knees) who had undergone primary TKA at the authors’ institute from November 2003 to March 2005. Fifty-five <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> 36 patients were excluded for various reasons: a different diagnosis from osteoarthritis (20 knees, including 4 <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> 3 patients with post-infectious arthritis, 7 <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> 6 patients with post-traumatic arthritis, 8 <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> 5 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 1 with neuropathic arthropathy), periprosthetic infection (4 <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> 4 patients; all the patients underwent bilateral TKAs, thus excluding 8 <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> the evaluation), death unrelated to the surgery (4 <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> 2 patients), significant medical problems (11 <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> 7 patients) unrelated to the surgery including cardiovascular or cerebrovascular accidents, Parkinson’s disease, and spine / hip fractures. Another 12 knees (8 patients) were excluded as the patients did not visit our clinic on the day appointed for 1 -year follow-up. Consequently, 383 TKAs (in 240 osteoarthritic patients) with follow-up longer than 1  year were included in this study. There were 230 female patients and 10 male patients (370 and 13 knees, respectively). The mean age in years was 68.8, ranging from 54 to 82 [standard deviation (SD) =  6.0]. The mean height and weight were 151.9  cm (range =  138 – 174  cm, SD =  6.1) and 60.6  kg (range =  36 – 83  kg, SD =  9.0). The mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.2  kg/m 2 (range =  18.1 – 37.2  kg/m 2, SD =  3.5). All patients gave informed consent prior to being included in this study. This study {{was approved by the}} institutional review board of our hospital and performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2000.|$|R

5|$|Campbell {{made his}} return to {{training}} in March 2011. Despite having seemingly recovered from the injury, Campbell suffered a recurrence of the ligament injury in the same <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> preparation for a match against Manchester City on 3 April 2011. After undergoing surgery on 20 April 2011, it was learned that Campbell {{would be out of}} action for 12 months. This injury ruled Campbell out of action {{for the remainder of the}} 2010–11 season and much of the 2011–12 season. Though he was proposed to return in March 2012, Steve Bruce revealed that Campbell was in the frame to return to action around Christmas time – three months ahead of schedule.|$|E

In the {{qualification}} {{round of the}} UEFA Cup against Hungarian side Győri ETO, he scored his first European goal in a 2–1 victory, taking his club to the next round. In December 2008, his manager and mentor Armin Veh was sacked. On 4 April 2009, Tasci scored his first league goal {{of the season in}} a 2–1 win over VfL Bochum. He missed {{the rest of the season}} after injuring his <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> a 2–0 loss against Eintracht Frankfurt. He required surgery but decided not to have it, ending his 2008–09 season.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.|$|E

Nevertheless, he is fondly remembered at the school. It was {{while he was at}} Ellesmere that he contracted measles, resulting in his need to wear glasses. An enthusiastic sportsman, Brunt played cricket, hockey, rugby, water polo and wrestling. He was the only pupil at the school to tackle the headmaster while playing rugby, injuring the older man's <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> the process.|$|E
5|$|After the 1992 season, Tolliver was a {{restricted}} free agent. Wilson {{signed a contract}} with the Saints, and to replace him the Falcons signed Bobby Hebert. Tolliver signed a one-year contract in August, after holding out for a time. Tolliver started the 1993 season as the third-string quarterback behind Hebert and Miller. However, Miller re-injured his left <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> late September, making Tolliver the main backup to Hebert. Tolliver made his first start against the Los Angeles Rams, but was injured in his second start against the Saints; the Falcons signed Chris Hakel {{as a result of the}} injury. Tolliver finished the season in occasional relief for Hebert, who remained bothered by injuries. Over the course of the year, Tolliver played in seven games and threw for just under 500 yards, and became a free agent after the season ended.|$|E
5|$|Becoming an {{unrestricted}} free {{agent for the}} third consecutive year in July 2010, Morrison did not initially receive any offers. As a result, he accepted a tryout with the Vancouver Canucks and attended the team's training camp in Penticton, British Columbia. At the conclusion of the pre-season, the Canucks offered Morrison a two-way contract, which he turned down. The following day, on October 4, 2010, Morrison was signed by the Calgary Flames to a one-year, one-way contract worth US$725,000. The Flames had signed Morrison in lieu of numerous injuries at the centre position on their roster. He scored his first goal as a Flame on October 16 in a 5–3 win against the Edmonton Oilers. After recording 43 points in 66 games, Morrison suffered a season-ending injury in March 2011. He hurt his left <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> a game against the Chicago Blackhawks when opposing defenceman Niklas Hjalmarsson pinned him against the end-boards. At the time of the injury, Morrison was leading the Flames with a plus-minus rating of +13 while centring the team's top line with Jarome Iginla and Alex Tanguay. On July 15, 2011, Morrison came to terms with the Flames on a one-year deal worth US$1.25 million.|$|E

5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Hokies {{averaged}} 29.3 {{points per game}} and scored at least 21 points in 22 consecutive games—a streak dating to the 1995 season. Virginia Tech's offense was led on the field by quarterback Al Clark, who passed for 1,476 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also ran for 344 yards during the regular season. At the beginning of December, however, Clark underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> order to repair damaged cartilage in the joint. Due to the long recovery time involved with the surgery, it was questioned if he would play in the Gator Bowl or {{if he would be}} able to play at full strength. Four days prior to the game, Clark's presence at the game was put even more in doubt when he caught the flu and developed a 102-degree fever. Clark's backup, redshirt freshman quarterback Nick Sorensen, completed 11 of his 21 pass attempts during the season for 140 yards and two touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 2007–08 season, Öhlund {{received}} a four-game suspension, {{the first of}} his career, for an incident near the end of a November 16, 2007, game against the Minnesota Wild. In the third period, Wild forward Mikko Koivu hit Öhlund, and Öhlund retaliated by slashing Koivu in the leg with his stick, breaking Koivu's fibula. After returning from the suspension, Öhlund became the Canucks' all-time leader in goals among defencemen, scoring the game-tying goal against the Edmonton Oilers on December 15, 2007, to pass former teammate Jyrki Lumme with 84 goals. After bone chips were detected in his <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> early March 2008, Öhlund underwent knee surgery on March 13 and missed the remainder of the season. The leading scorer amongst Canucks defencemen {{at the time of the}} surgery, Öhlund finished second amongst the defencemen with 24 points in 53 games.|$|E
5|$|George Steinbrenner died in July 2010. The Yankees won the league's {{wild card}} berth, but their title defense was ended by the Texas Rangers in the ALCS. Multiple Yankees players set {{individual}} marks in 2011. Jeter joined the 3,000 hit club on July 9; {{he was the}} first player to do so while playing for the club. Later in the season, Rivera posted the 602nd save of his career, breaking the all-time record that had been held by Trevor Hoffman. The Yankees won the AL East, but lost in the ALDS to the Tigers. Rivera suffered a season-ending injury to his right <b>knee</b> <b>in</b> May 2012 while catching fly balls before a game against the Royals. Even without their longtime closer, the 2012 Yankees gained a 10-game lead by mid-July, and held off the Orioles to win the division title by a final margin of two games. After defeating the Orioles in a five-game ALDS, the Yankees were swept by the Tigers in the ALCS.|$|E

40|$|The {{depth of}} the trochlear groove was {{frequently}} noted to be insufficient <b>in</b> <b>knees</b> with patellar instability, particularly in the proximal portion of the trochlea. To confirm this observation, the {{depth of the}} trochlear groove of the femur was measured on lateral radiographs of 218 knees: 40 <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> 20 asymptomatic subjects, 116 <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> 69 patients undergoing radiography for various symptoms (96 without and 20 with patellar subluxation, determined on axial radiographs), and 62 <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> 34 patients who underwent surgery for recurrent dislocation or subluxation of one or both patellae (40 treated and 22 contralateral <b>knees).</b> <b>In</b> the 40 <b>knees</b> that had been operated on, the proximal trochlear depth (measured 1 cm below the upper limit of the trochlear groove) was 2. 74 mm +/- 1. 35, in contrast to 5. 94 mm +/- 1. 74 in the asymptomatic subjects and 5. 84 mm +/- 1. 53 in the patients with symptoms but no patellar instability. Recognition of depth insufficiency in the proximal portion of the trochlea should prompt a search for patellar instability.
