25|$|The {{preceding}} alternative calculus is {{an example}} of a Hilbert-style deduction system. In the case of propositional systems the axioms are terms built with logical connectives and the only inference rule is modus ponens. Equational logic as standardly used informally in high school algebra <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> of calculus from Hilbert systems. Its theorems are equations and its inference rules express the properties of equality, namely that it is a congruence on terms that admits substitution.|$|E
500|$|Finline <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> of {{waveguide}} {{technology in}} which waves {{in a thin}} strip of dielectric are constrained by two strips of metallisation. [...] There {{are a number of}} possible topological arrangements of the dielectric and metal strips. [...] Finline is a variation of slot-waveguide {{but in the case of}} finline the whole structure is enclosed in a metal shield. [...] This has the advantage that, like hollow metal waveguide, no power is lost by radiation. [...] Finline filters can be made by printing a metallisation pattern on to a sheet of dielectric material and then inserting the sheet into the E-plane of a hollow metal waveguide much as is done with insert filters. [...] The metal waveguide forms the shield for the finline waveguide. [...] Resonators are formed by metallising a pattern on to the dielectric sheet. [...] More complex patterns than the simple insert filter of figure 9 are easily achieved because the designer does not have to consider the effect on mechanical support of removing metal. [...] This complexity does not add to the manufacturing costs since the number of processes needed does not change when more elements are added to the design. [...] Finline designs are less sensitive to manufacturing tolerances than insert filters and have wide bandwidths.|$|E

2500|$|This phrase {{evokes the}} {{primordial}} swamp and the Nqaul tree which grew within the original swamp.

Whilst some Serer sources postulates that the Saas was the first tree on Earth, the Serer oral tradition states that the Saas was not Nqual (the original tree in the swamp). Instead, Saas is attributed {{to one of the}} sacred trees useful for overall-bodily health. Another sacred tree − the Nquƭ, is also thought to have been the first tree. However, the general consensus is that the Nquƭ which has the properties to cure snakebite grew on the river bank whilst Nqual grew inside the primordial swamp.|$|E

A battle is fought on each map, and the victor advances to the next game map closer to his opponent's home starbase (or planet). Between rounds ships are repaired and replenished as usual. The game ends when one player advances to his opponent's home gameboard and vanquishes the enemy starbase (or if the enemy fleet is destroyed).|$|E
2500|$|The actress {{said that}} Lynsey feels guilty {{because she is}} in a {{relationship}} with Riley behind Mercedes' back, but Lynsey feels that she deserves to be happy because she usually places everyone else's needs above her own. Mercedes discovers Lynsey's relationship with Riley, which Metcalfe explained comes as a shock to Mercedes who has developed a close friendship with Lynsey so does not react as expected. Hassan said that her character's love rivals, Mercedes and Mitzeee, [...] "won't be looking after Lynsey's best interests, so she's going to have to fight for Riley's love. She's {{going to take care of}} number one - and if other people get hurt in the process, then so be it". She added that Lynsey values her friendship with Mercedes and would not want to lose it while Mitzeee <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> of threat. Hassan went on to say that the storyline will become [...] "deeper and darker" [...] and is not going to end happily, as even though Lynsey and Riley make a good couple Lynsey has never been lucky with men.|$|E
2500|$|Three events {{caused the}} Jewish {{population}} dominance to change after AD 70 (in the Late Roman period). The {{first was the}} rise of Christianity. The second involved the Jewish Diasporas resulting {{from a series of}} Jewish rebellions against the Roman occupation, starting in AD 66 which resulted in the destruction of the Second Temple and of Jerusalem in AD 70 to the subsequent expulsion of the Jews from Jerusalem, and followed by the rebellion against Hadrian in AD 132 – the Bar Kokhba revolt – [...] "The Judaean Jewish community never recovered from the Bar Kochba war. In its wake, Jews no longer formed the majority in Palestine, and the Jewish center moved to the Galilee." [...] The third event was the 'ascension' of Constantine the Great in 312 and Christianity becoming the official state religion of Rome in 391. Already by the mid-3rd century the Jewish majority had been reported to have been lost, while others conclude that a Jewish majority lasted much longer – [...] "What does seem clear <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> of change – immigration of Christians and the conversion of pagans, Samaritans, and Jews eventually produced a Christian majority".|$|E
