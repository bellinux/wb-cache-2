5|$|Shielded metal {{arc welding}} {{is one of the}} world's most popular welding processes, {{accounting}} for over half of all welding in some countries. Because of its versatility and simplicity, it is particularly dominant in the maintenance and repair industry, and is heavily used in the construction of steel structures and <b>in</b> <b>industrial</b> fabrication. In recent years its use has declined as flux-cored arc welding has expanded in the construction industry and gas {{metal arc welding}} has become more popular <b>in</b> <b>industrial</b> environments. However, because of the low equipment cost and wide applicability, the process will likely remain popular, especially among amateurs and small businesses where specialized welding processes are uneconomical and unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was pollution. Brick firing produced {{particulate air pollution}} and paint-making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain swill. The worst pollution was coal dust and smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. The greatest number of complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes. In spite of this, pollution control was hindered {{by a desire to}} promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate <b>in</b> <b>industrial</b> districts.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{hazardous}} nature of lead(II) nitrate, {{there is a}} preference for using alternatives <b>in</b> <b>industrial</b> applications. In the formerly major application of lead paints, it has largely been replaced by titanium dioxide. Other historical applications of lead(II) nitrate, such as in matches and fireworks, have declined or ceased as well. Current applications of lead(II) nitrate include use as a heat stabiliser in nylon and polyesters, as a coating for photothermographic paper, and in rodenticides.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of {{the process}} and the simplicity of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding is one of the world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and <b>in</b> <b>industrial</b> fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E
