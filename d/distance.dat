It also briefly describes how <b>distances</b> directly affect economic outcomes such as international trade, migrations, language acquisition and earnings, translations. Finally one can construct indices that take account (or not) of <b>distances</b> and how these indices are used by economists to measure their impact on outcomes such as redistribution, the provision of public goods, growth, or corruption aswell as on the effects of certain linguistic policies. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5|$|Measurements of the <b>distance</b> have {{elicited}} much controversy. Results {{prior to}} {{the launch of the}} Hipparcos satellite generally found that the Pleiades were about 135 parsecs away from Earth. Data from Hipparcos yielded a surprising result, namely a <b>distance</b> of only 118 parsecs by measuring the parallax of stars in the cluster—a technique that should yield the most direct and accurate results. Later work consistently argued that the Hipparcos <b>distance</b> measurement for the Pleiades was erroneous. In particular, distances derived to the cluster via the Hubble Space Telescope and infrared color-magnitude diagram fitting favor a <b>distance</b> between 135 and 140 pc; a dynamical <b>distance</b> from optical interferometric observations of the Pleiad double Atlas favors a <b>distance</b> of 133–137 pc. However, the author of the 2007–2009 catalog of revised Hipparcos parallaxes reasserted that the <b>distance</b> to the Pleiades is ~120 pc and challenged the dissenting evidence. Recently, Francis and Anderson proposed that a systematic effect on Hipparcos parallax errors for stars in clusters biases calculation using the weighted mean and gave a Hipparcos parallax <b>distance</b> of 126 pc and photometric <b>distance</b> 132 pc based on stars in the AB Doradus, Tucana-Horologium, and Beta Pictoris moving groups, which are all similar in age and composition to the Pleiades. Those authors note that the difference between these results can be attributed to random error.|$|E

5|$|The <b>distance</b> to the Pleiades {{can be used}} as an {{important}} first step to calibrate the cosmic <b>distance</b> ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its <b>distance</b> is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the <b>distance</b> allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose <b>distance</b> is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the <b>distance</b> scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic <b>distance</b> ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the <b>distance</b> to the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the <b>distance</b> to the Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic <b>distance</b> ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E
