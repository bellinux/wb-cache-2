40|$|Developers and {{contractors}} nowadays {{need to be}} aware of the extent of soil erosion at construction sites by estimating annual soil loss precisely so Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (ESCP) can be implemented with reasonable cost. Soil erosion at construction site that mainly caused by massive earthworks activities could endanger environment by clogging drains with excessive sediments and conducing flash flood in a long term run. Hence, one of the objectives of this research is to determine a suitable method either by Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) or Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) by comparing the soil loss rates and also differentiate the methods. Simultaneously, a RUSLE software program is developed. The study is conducted by comparing annual soil loss yielded by both USLE and RUSLE on a case study at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Jasin, Melaka construction site on a 39. 99 hectares land. Rate of soil loss is estimated during earthworks activity which considered being as worst case scenario. Rate of soil loss by USLE is obtained from Environment Impact Assessment (<b>ETA)</b> <b>Report</b> done by Europasia Engineering Sdn. Bhd. while rate of soil loss by RUSLE is calculated using the Erosion and Sediment Control Guideline provided by Department of Environment ('DOE). Therefore, the RUSLE software program developed is used to assist in calculations. Conclusively, RUSLE suits to be practised, in construction industry in order to approximate soil erosion rate...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} and analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of transient emission near 4680 Å in <b>Eta</b> Car, <b>reported</b> earlier by Steiner & Damineli (2004). If, as seems probable, this is He II λ 4687, {{then it is}} a unique clue to Eta Car's 5. 5 -year cycle. According to our analysis, several aspects of this feature support a mass-ejection model of the observed spectroscopic events, and not an eclipse model. The He II emission appeared in early 2003, grew to a brief maximum during the 2003. 5 spectroscopic event, and then abruptly disappeared.

In contrast to conventional Ru-complex {{dye-sensitized solar cells}} (DSCs), the cell efficiency(eta) of PTAA-sensitized solar cells exhibited strong dependence on the TiO 2 pore structures. Incorporation of up to 40 wt % large TiO 2 nanoparticles (L-TiO 2) into small TiO 2 nanoparticles (S-TiO 2) increased eta, {{in spite of a}} reduction in dye loading due to a decrease in surface area. The highest eta of 2. 36 +/- 0. 04 % was obtained for a TiO 2 film comprised of S-TiO 2 (60 wt %) and L-TiO 2 (40 wt %). Electrochemical impedance measurements suggested that the 25 % increase in eta for the DSC comprised of 40 wt % L-TiO 2 resulted not from rapid diffusion of the redox electrolyte through the larger pores, but instead was due to the higher electron density in the conduction band of TiO 2. It was inferred, therefore, that the highest eta obtained for the DSC comprised of 40 wt % L-TiO 2 was due to the high degree of anchoring of COOH groups.

30|$|In addition, the {{potentially}} molecular mechanism behind the significant association was briefly elucidated in this study. In silico analysis in four tools for predicting transcription factors binding sites {{found that a}} reliable transcription factor called CEBPA binds on rs 2290639 and nearby nucleotides {{in three of the}} four tools (Fig.  3). Moreover, the eQTLs results also implied that there was a strong association of this polymorphism and the expression level of the HOMER 1 protein. Although rs 2290639 is located on the downstream region of the HOMER 1 gene, this polymorphism together with nearby nucleotides may act as a regulatory module influencing the transcription of HOMER 1 as the regulatory module could be located in the intron region or downstream region (Fiskerstrand et al. 1999; Lovejoy et al. 2003; Baum et al. 2008; Rosenthal et al. 1990). Previous studies reported that one repeat length polymorphism (STin 2), albeit located in the second intron of SLC 6 A 4 (serotonin transporter) gene, had functional role in the expression of SLC 6 A 4 (Lovejoy et al. 2003; Fiskerstrand et al. 1999). Moreover, several polymorphisms or haplotypes in the first intron of DGKH (diacylglycerol kinase <b>eta)</b> gene were <b>reported</b> to be associated with bipolar disorder in Caucasians and Chinese (Baum et al. 2008; Zeng et al. 2011). Our group found that a different polymorphism, also located in the first intron of DGKH gene, was significantly associated with bipolar disorder in Hong Kong Chinese (Rao et al. 2015). Besides, Rosenthal et al. reported that an enhancer element was located downstream of the coding region in MLC (myosin light chain) 1 / 3 gene (Rosenthal et al. 1990). Thus, the regulatory function of rs 2290639 and the interaction between rs 2290639 and CEBPA are worthy to be investigated by further experimental approaches to determine how they influence the transcription of the HOMER 1 gene.|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} {{alternative}} schools is {{widely available in}} the literature; however, once a student has been labeled a "troublemaker" and has been placed in a District Alternative Education Program (DAEP), a Type II setting, there is limited information about the overall success of students upon their return to the mainstream. This study compared the success of students formerly placed in a modified disciplinary Type II setting, once they {{have returned to the}} mainstream, with their success prior to disciplinary placement. The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine if disciplinary measures that remove students from the mainstream environment negatively impact the variables that measure school success, despite legislative mandates such as No Child Left Behind, which advocates success for every student. The population for this study was 86 7 th- through 11 th-grade students assigned to a DAEP in Texas during the spring of 2003. A comparison of pre- and post-placement dependent variables measuring school success-attendance, passing core courses, behavioral achievement, standardized test score achievement, recidivism, and dropout rates-comprised this study. The independent variables-gender, ethnicity, grade level, socioeconomic status, and disciplinary offense-were used to compare and analyze each dependent variable. The dependent variables of attendance, passing core courses, and behavior demonstrated a decline in the measurement of school success across time. The only dependent variable that demonstrated improvement between the pre- and post-placement periods was achievement on standardized test scores. From the number of students who withdrew from the mainstream during the post-placement semesters, large recidivism and dropout rates were determined, which reflected the large percentage of students who were not successful in the district's mainstream. The comparisons of dependent variables by independent variables resulted in significance only in the analyses of attendance by grade level. This interaction was determined to be significant since p <. 05. During both post-placement semesters, 11 th-grade attendance increased by 20. 2 points. Students in the 7 th, 8 th, and 9 th grades maintained a slight increase in attendance between the pre-placement and first post-placement semester yet experienced an attendance decline in the second post-placement semester. This decline was seen in all three grade levels between the pre-placement and the second post-placement semesters. Attendance among tenth graders declined throughout all semesters of the study. The comparison of attendance by disciplinary offense resulted in a large effect size (eta 2). The <b>eta</b> 2 <b>reported</b> within 29. 8 % accuracy in variability when attendance was compared by disciplinary offense. Students placed for assault demonstrated a 27. 7 point increase in attendance by the second post-placement semester. Despite the comparison of attendance by the grade level of students being the only significant result, and the comparison of attendance by disciplinary offense resulting in a large effect size, several specific conclusions were drawn from the analyses of the pre- and post-placement data measuring school success. All dependent variable measurements, with the exception of standardized test score achievement, resulted in an overall reduction of mean scores across time. This decline indicates that students do demonstrate a decline in school success following a removal from a mainstream setting...|$|R
40|$|The optimum {{management}} {{strategy for the}} patient with a multinodular nontoxic goitre is still a matter of debate. Our aim {{was to assess the}} attitudes towards management of such patients throughout Europe by means of a questionnaire. The questionnaire was circulated to all clinician members of the European Thyroid Association (<b>ETA).</b> A case <b>report</b> was followed by diagnostic investigations and choice of therapy in the index case (a 42 -year-old woman with an irregular nontender bilaterally enlarged thyroid of 50 - 80 g and no clinical suspicion of malignancy). Eleven variations of the basic case report were proposed in order to evaluate the impact on management of each alteration. One hundred and sixty-seven members replied to the letter, and 120 individuals from 22 countries completed the questionnaire (corresponding to approximately two-thirds of the clinical members of the ETA). Based on the index case, serum TSH was the routine choice of 100 %, and serum free T 4 /T 4 -index was included by 74 %. Serum TPO autoantibodies, Tg autoantibodies and calcitonin were measured by 65 %, 49 % and 32 %, respectively. The median number of blood tests used was four (range 1 - 11). Considerable intercountry variations were seen in the preferred imaging methods. Ninety-one percent of the clinicians would use at least one imaging modality. Ultrasound (US) was used by 84 %, thyroid scintigraphy by 76 %, and both methods by 69 %. US had first priority (53 % vs. 19 % for scintigraphy). If scintigraphy was performed, fine-needle aspiration cytology was routinely used by 17 % (inhomogeneous uptake) and 95 % (dominant 'cold' area), and 63 % used US-guidance. L-T 4 treatment was supported by 52 % of the clinicians, iodine supplementation by 4 %, radioiodine by 6 % and surgery by 10 %. In the case of a suppressed serum TSH, radioiodine treatment was preferred by 44 %, while surgery was the favoured recommendation in four clinical variations with a large goitre or suspicion of malignancy. Marked differences between the countries were suggested by L-T 4 therapy being the dominant treatment in Italy, France and Germany in contrast to the prevailing use of radioiodine in Denmark and a wait and see policy in the UK.

40|$|Immunotoxins (ITs) {{commonly}} {{are composed}} of modified antibodies that are linked to a toxin either chemically or through the generation of a fusion protein. The antibody directs the IT to specific target cells where it binds to surface molecules and is internalized, allowing the cytotoxic component to kill the cell. ITs are regarded as particularly suitable {{for the treatment of}} cancer, and several ITs containing plant or bacterial toxins have been evaluated for immunotherapy, the most potent toxins being Pseudomonas exotoxin A (ETA), diphtheria toxin and ricin. These toxins contain a catalytic domain responsible for the cytotoxic activity and a translocation domain that facilitates transfer of the catalytic domain into the cytosol of target cells, optimizing cytotoxicity. Recently, an IT based on <b>ETA</b> was <b>reported,</b> which was specific for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. These cells are often characterized by overexpression of FcγR I (CD 64), a receptor with high affinity for the Fc portion of immunoglobulins G 1 and G 3, which is normally expressed on monocytes and macrophages. These AML cells are targeted efficiently by the humanized anti-CD 64 single chain antibody fragment (scFv) h 22 (scFv) and killed by ETA. However, the major drawback of such ITs is their potential immunogenicity. Repeated doses may cause hypersensitive reactions and lead to neutralization of the ITs by antibodies directed against the non-human domains. Further complications result from the non-specific binding of foreign proteins, leading to vascular leak syndrome and ultimately interstitial oedema and organ failure. The development of ITs containing human or humanized components may circumvent these problems. Neither should such ITs be immunogenic, nor should they show non-specific toxic effects. However, these human proteins do not possess their own translocation domain as mentioned above; thus, translocation of the toxic moiety into the cytosol is dependent on target structure internalization. The integration of a recombinant adapter that contains a synthetic translocation domain flanked by proteolytically cleavable endosomal and cytosolic consensus should compensate for these disadvantages and increase IT cytotoxicity. First, based on the well defined IT h 22 (scFv) -ETA, the functionality of this molecular adapter was compared to the properties of the natural translocation domain of ETA. Therefore a truncated version of the IT h 22 (scFv) -ETA was developed in which the natural translocation domain of ETA was replaced by the molecular adapter. In addition, an IT-version without adapter and natural tranlocation domain was designed to compare all resulting data. The ITs were expressed efficiently in E. coli and isolated from the periplasmic space for purification by IMAC. All variants bound specifically to CD 64 + cells, as documented by flow cytometry, and exhibited specific toxicity towards CD 64 + cell lines. With an IC 50 of 0. 5 nm, the toxicity of the IT containing the molecular adapter was comparable to the reference-IT h 22 (scFv) -ETA. The IT with no translocation domain and no adapter was 20 times less efficient (IC 50 = 10 nm). These results indicate that properties of the natural translocation domain and the adapter are similar. Based on these results a completely humanized IT and two IT-variants containing differently modified, cleavable adapter sequences were compared. As before, all ITs were based on the CD 64 specific single chain antibody fragment h 22 (scFv) which is overexpressed on a subset of AML cells. The scFv was directly, or via recombinant adapters, coupled to the human RNase angiogenin, which exhibits cytotoxic activity following internalization. Two different adapter variants were used to optimize the translocation and toxicity of the ITs. All three ITs were expressed efficiently in E. coli and isolated from the periplasmic space for subsequent purification by IMAC. All variants also bound specifically to CD 64 + cells, as documented by flow cytometry, and showed specific toxicity via apoptosis towards CD 64 + cell lines. Most importantly, it was demonstrated that the insertion of a molecular adapter that contains cleavable peptides and a membrane transfer peptide increased the cytotoxicity up to 20 -fold (from an IC 50 of 0, 2 nm up to an IC 50 of 0, 01 nm) but markedly decreased serum stability (from more than 24 hours stability down to 1 hour). The deletion of the endosomal-cleavable peptide within the molecular adapter dramatically enhanced serum stability while the cytotoxic potential was still more than 10 -fold higher (IC 50 = 0, 03) in comparison to the IT with no adapter (IC 50 = 0, 2 nm) ...|$|R
