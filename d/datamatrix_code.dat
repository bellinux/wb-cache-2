50|$|Due to {{the absence}} of a {{standard}} code, the readers are faced with the same problem. On the one hand there is a remarkable number of readers which aren't able to identify barcodes apart from their own proprietary codes. On the other hand, there are several readers which were created to read out non-proprietary code, these 'open source codes' are the most used for Optical Reading with Mobile like the QR Code and the Data Matrix. However, a QR code is always 60% larger than a <b>DataMatrix</b> <b>code</b> and this tends to mean that DM is the primary code used in packaging and enterprise solutions for example.|$|E

The incorporation of incorporating <b>Datamatrix</b> <b>codes</b> (DM) to the fieldwork {{and use of}} PDA. This novelty reduces the error rate (from 40% to 1%) and the labeling time in a half. This methodology is starting to be adapted to other archaeological projects across Europe.|$|R

The system soft-ware drives a standard flatbed scanner in order to acquire an image, interprets <b>DataMatrix</b> bar <b>codes</b> at predefined locations in the image, and returns in an array the interpreted bar code data along with other associated information. Commercial software components were used for the image acquisition and bar code interpretation portion of the software. An example is given that illustrates how to call the custom software from Microsoft ® Excel and insert the returned data directly into a spreadsheet...|$|R
40|$|<b>Datamatrix</b> <b>code</b> {{is a type}} of 2 D {{codes that}} can encode much more data on the same or smaller area than the linearbarcodes. This makes 2 D codes usable for marking even very small items. 2 D codes can be decoded by thereaders in retails but also with the mobile phones {{equipped}} with camera and appropriate software. 2 D codes canbe depicted in different materials or printed on different printing substrates. The application area of the codes isbroad, from magazines and newspapers to posters and packaging. Successful reading of 2 D codes is possible ifthe code is printed in appropriate contrast between the printing ink and substrate, like black ink printed on whitematt paper. Problems can occur if the code is printed in colors. The readability of 2 D Datamatrix codes printed incyan, magenta, yellow and black was studied. Yellow is proved to be poorly readable. In addition, the bi-coloredand multi-colored 2 D Datamatrix codes were studied. When four colors are used in creation of the 2 D Datamatrixcode, poorly readable elements, yellow codewords, may cause the reading failure. 2 D Datamatix codes are capableto ensure good readability even if they contain a defined number of poorly readable codewords due to the Reed –Solomon error-correction system. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the effect of using yellow printed, poorlyreadable, codewords in the multi-colored 2 D <b>Datamatrix</b> <b>code</b> on the code readability...|$|E

Part of this printout is a <b>datamatrix</b> <b>code</b> that encodes all medication information using the XML-based UKF (German: Ultrakurzformat) in order to include a means for a standardized electronic transfer of the data. Generated by the general practitioner, the medication plan also needs to be updated through medical specialists, clinical doctors or pharmacists. This paper documents, based on usage scenarios for the BMP, the long way from theory to practical use and points to organizational and technical hurdles that need to be overcome as part of the digitalization. Along with the implications for the process dimension, a technical infrastructure is introduced and different challenges in working with the UKF are identified and discusse...|$|E

There {{are a number of}} competing systems, including open standards like Quick Response QR <b>Codes,</b> <b>Datamatrix,</b> Semacodes (based on Datamatrix), and barcodes; or proprietary systems like ShotCodes. The design of such coding schemes needs to be rich enough to include lots of information and robust enough for the tag to be readable, even when partly obscured or damaged: tags might be on the outside of buildings and exposed to wear and the weather.|$|R
