25|$|After Taiwan was seceded to Japan in 1895, The Civil Code of Japan {{was created}} in 1896. It was heavily {{influenced}} by {{the first draft of}} the <b>German</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> and the French Civil Code. The code is divided into five books. Those on family and succession retain certain vestiges of the old patriarchal family system that was the basis of Japanese feudalism. It was in these sections that most of the postwar revisions were made. At that time it was considered no longer necessary or desirable to pay such homage to the past, and the sections dealing with family law and succession were brought closer to European civil law. This law was applied to Taiwan.|$|E

50|$|Commentary on {{the media}} sententiaNicholas criticises the media sententia as {{it did not take}} into account the {{relative}} importance of the materials and the maker's skill. Borkowski suggests that the test was not feasible if there was nothing left of the original material, e.g. if the creator chipped away at bronze to make a statue. The French and <b>German</b> <b>civil</b> <b>codes</b> take such considerations into account, e.g. the French system gives the nova species to the owner of the substance unless the work exceeds the materials, and the Germans reverse this balance. In both cases, compensation must be made to the party who loses out.|$|R

25|$|Ancient India and China {{represent}} distinct {{traditions of}} law, and have historically had independent schools of legal theory and practice. The Arthashastra, probably compiled around 100AD (although it contains older material), and the Manusmriti (c.100–300AD) were foundational treatises in India, and comprise texts considered authoritative legal guidance. Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and pluralism, and was cited across Southeast Asia. This Hindu tradition, along with Islamic law, was supplanted by {{the common law}} when India {{became part of the}} British Empire. Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore and Hong Kong also adopted the common law. The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences. Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the French, but mostly the <b>German</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Code.</b> This partly reflected Germany's status as a rising power in the late 19thcentury. Similarly, traditional Chinese law gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the Qing Dynasty in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law. Today Taiwanese law retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists, who fled there, and Mao Zedong's communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the People's Republic of China was heavily influenced by Soviet Socialist law, which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights. Due to rapid industrialisation, today China is undergoing a process of reform, {{at least in terms of}} economic, if not social and political, rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a move away from administrative domination. Furthermore, after negotiations lasting fifteen years, in 2001 China joined the World Trade Organisation.|$|E
500|$|The Codex of Justinian {{also had}} a great {{influence}} on Western law, particularly on the juridic history and tradition of western Europe and its American colonies. In Italy, a single complete copy of the Justinian Digest survived and lay forgotten until its rediscovery in 1070. In 1088, Irnerius, a jurist and teacher of the liberal arts in Bologna, {{was the first to}} teach the newly recovered Digest and the rest of Justinian's books. He and his successors explained the Roman laws to their students by means of glosses or explanatory notes written on the edges or between the text lines. The Roman legal concepts resulting from the studies of these [...] "glossators" [...] spread to the universities and law courts of Europe. [...] The Roman law revival that started in Italy, during the Middle Ages, was taken up by France, the Netherlands and Germany in later centuries. The enactment of the <b>German</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> in 1900 {{put an end to the}} application of extant forms of law derived from the Justinian codes in most European states.|$|E

His work regarding Roman history is still of fundamental importance for contemporary research. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1902 for being [...] "the greatest living master of the art of historical writing, with special reference to his monumental work A History of Rome", after having been nominated by 18 members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.

2500|$|First, if a Directive's {{deadline}} for implementation is not met, the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws, and a citizen may {{rely on the}} Directive in such an action (so called [...] "vertical" [...] direct effect). So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could [...] "not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails". Second, a citizen or company can also invoke a Directive as a defence in a dispute with another citizen or company (not just a public authority) which is attempting to enforce a national law that conflicts with a Directive. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors {{that it had not}} complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a [...] "general principle" [...] of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its {{deadline for}} implementation. This follows from Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the <b>German</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms Kücükdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Fourth, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers. This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised, as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision.|$|E

40|$|Legal {{systems of}} {{countries}} include laws, regulations and procedures that may deter acts harmful to others. Deterrence incentives created by legal systems underlie effects {{documented in the}} Law and Finance literature, which has shown that legal systems can offer protection to investors against expropriation. This protection in turn fosters {{the development of a}} country's financial markets. Incentives created by legal system can extend beyond investor protection, deterring other types of harmful acts as well. This study presents evidence on deterrence incentives in other areas, finding that fatality rates from motor vehicle accidents and from other types of accidents vary significantly across countries classified by origin of legal system. Motor vehicle accident fatality rates in countries whose legal systems are based on English Common Law generally have been lower than those in civil law countries, especially countries with legal systems based on French <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> or former members of the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries. Fatality rates from other types of accidents are lowest in common-law countries; followed by those in French, then <b>German,</b> then Scandinavian <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> countries, with the highest fatality rates occurring in former Eastern Bloc and Soviet Union countries. The pattern of motor vehicle accident fatality rates resembles patterns of corporate control values found in the Law and Finance literature, which is evidence that aspects of a country=s legal system protecting investors also deter other types of possibly harmful acts. The disparity between low motor vehicle accident fatality rates and high fatality rates from other types of accidents in Scandinavian countries is more difficult to explain. Scandinavian laws targeting motor vehicle operation, esp [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The {{ultimate}} aim of a European <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> is, like {{a national}} <b>civil</b> <b>code,</b> to deal comprehensively with the core areas of private law.

The law of obligations includes the law of contracts, delicts (or torts) and restitution. It was from work on European contract law that the push for a comprehensive European <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> arose. The development of a European <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> has primarily focused on creating a unified law of contracts.
