25|$|As the Armistice Demarcation Lines were {{technically}} not borders, the Arabs {{considered that}} Israel was restricted in its rights {{to develop the}} DMZ and exploitation of the water resources.

Hoche's chief of staff Gabriel Marie Joseph, comte d'Hédouville brought up some French cavalry squadrons from the Osterberg and hit the Saxons <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>right</b> flank. More horsemen from both sides joined the melee and ultimately the Saxons prevailed. Shaken by the cavalry charge, the French infantry withdrew to the Otterbach valley.

25|$|On 25 September, 56th Division {{attacked}} from Bouleaux Wood towards Combles. On their left, 1st Battalion East Surrey Regiment and 1st Battalion Devonshire Regiment led 95th Brigade's attack towards Morval, and {{on their}} left was the 1st Cheshires of 15th Brigade. The East Surreys and Devonshires were supported by the Glosters' 12th Battalion and 2nd Battalion King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB). The 56th Division attack was held up by machine-gun fire from a railway embankment north of Combles, which also caught the East Surreys <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>right</b> flank and halted their progress. The Devonshires, meanwhile, had looped left and were attacking a strong-point on the Ginchy–Morval road. In the afternoon, 12th Glosters and 2nd KOSB pushed on and took the southern half of Morval, and just after 15:00 1st Cheshires rushed the northern half. The capture of Morval and the French capture of Fregicourt, east of Combles, had rendered the German position in Combles untenable, and the village was captured on 26 September.|$|E
25|$|Meade's orders had {{stated that}} the {{reconnaissance}} in force by four of his corps would be started by 7 a.m. on July 14, but by this time signs were clear that the enemy had withdrawn. Advancing skirmishers found that the entrenchments were empty. Meade ordered a general pursuit of the Confederates at 8:30a.m., but very little contact could be made at this late hour. Cavalry under Buford and Kilpatrick attacked the rearguard of Lee's army, Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division, which was still on a ridge about {{a mile and a}} half from Falling Waters. The initial attack caught the Confederates by surprise after a long night with little sleep, and hand-to-hand fighting ensued. Kilpatrick attacked again and Buford struck them <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>right</b> and rear. Heth's and Pender's divisions lost as many as 2,000 men as prisoners. Brig. Gen. J.

Although the club hoped to avoid a [...] "patchwork" [...] starting rotation like 2013's, it already lacked pitching depth; two top prospects, Adam Morgan and Shane Watson, were lost {{for most of the}} season due to shoulder surgery. Mike Adams, acquired by the Phillies as their setup man but who missed most of the 2013 season before offseason surgery, threw a bullpen session in late February and said he felt [...] "real good" [...] and hoped to join the bullpen by April. David Buchanan started the Phillies' fourth spring-training game, pitching two good innings; after the game, MLB.com Phillies beat reporter called him a dark-horse candidate for the Phillies' starting rotation. Miguel Alfredo González was less effective in that game. Early in March the Phillies announced that Hamels had a [...] "setback" [...] in his recovery (arm fatigue), and the likelihood of his pitching in April was [...] "remote"; this necessitated a new fifth starter.

500|$|The {{political}} {{influence of the}} Commons originally lay <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>right</b> to grant taxes. The financial demands of the Hundred Years' War were enormous, and the king and his ministers tried different methods of covering the expenses. The king had a steady income from crown lands, and could also take up substantial loans from Italian and domestic financiers. To finance warfare on Edward III's scale, the king {{had to resort to}} taxation of his subjects. Taxation took two primary forms: levy and customs. The levy was a grant of a proportion of all moveable property, normally a tenth for towns and a fifteenth for farmland. This could produce large sums of money, but each such levy had to be approved by parliament, and the king had to prove the necessity. The customs therefore provided a welcome supplement, as a steady and reliable source of income. An [...] "ancient duty" [...] on the export of wool had existed since 1275. Edward I had tried to introduce an additional duty on wool, but this unpopular maltolt, or [...] "unjust exaction", was soon abandoned. Then, from 1336 onwards, a series of schemes aimed at increasing royal revenues from wool export were introduced. After some initial problems and discontent, it was agreed through the Ordinance of the Staple of 1353 that the new customs should be approved by parliament, though in reality they became permanent.|$|E
