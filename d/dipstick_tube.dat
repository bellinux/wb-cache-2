5000|$|Upon {{completion}} {{they were}} sent to Prototype Technology Group (PTG) Racing in Virginia for final preparation, which included {{the front and rear}} Motorsport flag decals, and [...] "trunk kit." [...] In the trunk there was a different oil pan with special oil pump with dual pickups as used on the European M3 and later on the E46 M3, longer oil <b>dipstick</b> <b>tube,</b> front strut bar, lower x brace, spacer blocks to raise the rear wing, and an adjustable front splitter. Each new owner was given a 1-page legal document to sign stating that any installation of trunk items voided the new car warranty.|$|E
50|$|The block {{underwent}} {{some changes}} since its inception. In 1971, deck height was extended from 9.480 in to 9.503 in (casting D1AE-6015-DA) {{to lower the}} compression ratio to reduce NOx emissions without the need to change piston or cylinder-head design. In 1974, a boss was added {{on the front of}} the right cylinder bank to mount the air injection pump (casting D4AE-A). In 1974, the oil <b>dipstick</b> <b>tube</b> moved from the timing case to the skirt under the left cylinder bank near the rear of the casting. These details made swapping older blocks from passenger cars with front sump oil pans to more recent rear-sumped Mustang and LTD/Crown Vic Ford cars more difficult unless an oil pan had the dipstick mounted therein. In 1984, the rear main seal was changed from a two-piece component to a one-piece design.|$|E
50|$|The 351W {{is often}} {{confused}} with the 351 Cleveland, which is a different engine of identical displacement.The 351 cuin L Windsor featured a 1.3 in (32.5 mm) taller deck height than the 302, allowing a stroke of 3.5 in (88.9 mm). Although very much related in general configuration to the 289-302 and sharing the same bell housing, motor mounts, and other small parts, the 351W had a unique, tall-deck block, larger main bearing caps, thicker, longer connecting rods, and a distinct firing order (1-3-7-2-6-5-4-8 versus the usual 1-5-4-2-6-3-7-8, a means to move the unacceptable 'noise' of the consecutive firing adjacent front cylinders to the more rigid rear part of the engine block all while reducing excessive main bearing load), adding some 25 lb (11 kg) to the engine's dry weight. The distributor is slightly different, so as to accommodate a larger oil pump shaft and larger oil pump. Some years had threaded <b>dipstick</b> <b>tubes.</b> It had a unique head which optimized torque over high-rpm breathing, frequently replaced by enthusiasts with aftermarket heads providing better performance. The early 1969 and 1970 heads had larger valves and ports for better performance. The head castings and valve head sizes from 1969 to 1976 were different, notably in passages for air injection and spark plug diameters (1969-1974 18 mm, 1975 and up 14 mm). From 1977 onward, the 351W shared the same head casting as the 302, differing only in bolt hole diameters (7/16 inch for 302, 1/2 inch for 351W). Early blocks (casting ID C9OE-6015-B) had enough metal on bearing saddles 2, 3, and 4 for four-bolt mains, and as with all small-block Fords (SBFs), were superior in strength to most late-model, lightweight castings. Generally, the 1969 to 1974 blocks {{are considered to be}} far superior in strength than the later blocks, making these early units some of the strongest and most desirable in the entire SBF engine family including the 335-series. During the 1980s, a four-barrel version (intake manifold casting ID E6TE-9425-B) was reintroduced for use in light trucks and vans. In 1988, fuel injection replaced the four-barrel carburetor. Roller camshaft/lifters were introduced in this engine in 1994.|$|R
