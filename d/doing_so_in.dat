5|$|The {{final scene}} {{is the story}} of Noah's drunkenness. After the Flood, Noah tills the soil and grows vines. He is shown <b>doing</b> <b>so,</b> <b>in</b> the {{background}} of the picture.

Taken together, these three pictures serve to show that Humankind had moved a long way from God's perfect creation. However, it is through Shem and his descendants, the Israelites, that Salvation will come to the world.|$|E
