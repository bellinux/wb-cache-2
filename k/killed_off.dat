5|$|When it {{came time}} to kill off Ana Lucia, the {{character}} of Libby was killed {{at the same time to}} create an emotional impact. This happened amidst rumours that the characters were <b>killed</b> <b>off</b> because both actresses in question had been arrested for DUI while filming on location in Oahu. The producers denied that Ana Lucia was <b>killed</b> <b>off</b> because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies were hard to deal with, but she loved the scenery.|$|E
5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are <b>killed</b> <b>off</b> so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa suggest Homer have a go at voice acting {{when they}} read {{that there will be}} open auditions. Homer auditions to read for Poochie's voice, and gets the part. He and June Bellamy, his fellow voice actor, make several {{publicity}} stops to promote Poochie, where Homer confronts the show's hardcore fans. Homer invites all of his friends and relatives to the screening of the first Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show. However, the cartoon is full of clichés and asinine antics, and by emphasizing Poochie, contains none of the show's trademark violence. Everyone except Homer finds the episode unimpressive. Meyers is forced to admit that Poochie's debut was a dud, and he decides {{to get rid of the}} character. Homer learns that Poochie will be <b>killed</b> <b>off,</b> and resolves to keep Poochie alive. At his next recording session, rather than reading from the script, he implores the audience, through lines that he wrote, to give Poochie a fair chance. The writing team appears moved by Homer's statement. However, on airing, his statement is dubbed over by Myers and Poochie is <b>killed</b> <b>off</b> in a poorly edited fashion. The in-studio audience cheers wildly as Krusty promises that Poochie is gone for good. Homer feels betrayed but attributes the affair to the nature of show business.|$|E

This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and {{as he tries to}} get away from it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia.|$|E

One person was <b>killed</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Belize after being washed off his boat by large swells produced by Carmen. Three other fishermen were listed as missing following similar incidents. Thousands of people moved from coastal areas inland to escape the storm. Crop damage in the country was reportedly severe.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, {{popular culture}} writer Anna Leszkiewicz {{suggested}} {{that even though}} The Simpsons still holds cultural relevance, contemporary appeal is only for the first ten seasons, with recent episodes only garnering mainstream attention when a favorite character from the golden era is <b>killed</b> <b>off,</b> or when new information and shock twists are given for old characters. The series' ratings have also declined; while the first season enjoyed an average of 13.4 million viewing households per episode in the U.S., the twenty-first season {{had an average of}} 7.2 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis ulmi) <b>killed</b> <b>off</b> all the elms {{that once}} {{populated}} {{the park and}} crab apples were planted to replace the elms along the pedestrian mall. After deteriorating over the decades Washington Park saw a revival in the 1990s and 2000s with the flower beds being restored to their original specifications, the pedestrian mall removed of pavement and widened to its original dimensions with disease-resistant elms planted to form a canopy, the King Fountain relit at night, and the lilac shrub border around {{the periphery of the}} park being restored.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{landslides}} {{and floods}} {{are projected to}} become increasingly common in such states as Assam. Ecological disasters, such as a 1998 coral bleaching event that <b>killed</b> <b>off</b> more than 70% of corals in the reef ecosystems off Lakshadweep and the Andamans and was brought on by elevated ocean temperatures tied to global warming, are also projected to become increasingly common. Meghalaya and other northeastern states are also concerned that rising sea levels will submerge much of Bangladesh and spawn a refugee crisis. If severe climate changes occurs, Bangladesh and parts of India that border it may lose vast tracts of coastal land.|$|E

5|$|The Joker is {{a fictional}} supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson who first {{appeared}} in the debut issue of the comic book Batman (April 25, 1940), published by DC Comics. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design, while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be <b>killed</b> <b>off</b> during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman.|$|E
