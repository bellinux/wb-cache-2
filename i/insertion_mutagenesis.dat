We used site-directed mutagenesis to study the potential role of the transmembrane domains of the prM proteins of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in prM-E heterodimerization as well as subviral particle formation. Alanine <b>insertion</b> scanning <b>mutagenesis</b> within the GXXXG motif in the first transmembrane segment of JEV prM protein affected the prM-E heterodimerization; its specificity was confirmed by replacing the two glycines of the GXXXG motif with alanine, leucine and valine.

Incubation of MuA transposase protein with artificial mini-Mu transposon DNA {{in the absence of}} divalent cations in vitro resulted in stable but inactive Mu DNA transposition complexes, or transpososomes. Following delivery into bacterial cells by electroporation, the complexes were activated for DNA transposition chemistry after encountering divalent metal ions within the cells. Mini-Mu transposons were integrated into bacterial chromosomes with efficiencies ranging from 104 to 106 CFU/μg of input transposon DNA in the four species tested, i. e., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Erwinia carotovora, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Efficiency of integration was influenced mostly by the competence status of a given strain or batch of bacteria. An accurate 5 -bp target site duplication flanking the transposon, a hallmark of Mu transposition, was generated upon mini-Mu integration into the genome, indicating that a genuine DNA transposition reaction was reproduced within the cells of the bacteria studied.

40|$|<b>Insertion</b> {{duplication}} <b>mutagenesis</b> and allelic replacement mutagenesis {{are among}} the most commonly utilized approaches for targeted mutagenesis in bacteria. However, both techniques are limited by a variety of factors that can complicate mutant phenotypic studies. To circumvent these limitations, multiple markerless mutagenesis techniques have been developed that utilize either temperature-sensitive plasmids or counterselectable suicide vectors containing both positive- and negative-selection markers. For many species, these techniques are not especially useful due to difficulties of cloning with Escherichia coli and/or a lack of functional negative-selection markers. In this study, we describe the development of a novel approach for the creation of markerless mutations. This system employs a cloning-independent methodology and should be easily adaptable to a wide array of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. The entire process of creating both the counterselection cassette and mutation constructs can be completed using overlapping PCR protocols, which allows extremely quick assembly and eliminates the requirement for either temperature-sensitive replicons or suicide vectors. As a proof of principle, we used Streptococcus mutans reference strain UA 159 to create markerless in-frame deletions of 3 separate bacteriocin genes as well as triple mutants containing all 3 deletions. Using a panel of 5 separate wild-type S. mutans strains, we further demonstrated that the procedure is nearly 100 % efficient at generating clones with the desired markerless mutation, which is a considerable improvement in yield compared to existing approaches...|$|R

40|$|Complement protein C 9 assembles with C 5, C 6, C 7, C 8 on {{the surface}} of target cells to form the lytic {{membrane}} attack complex (MAC). During MAC assembly and insertion into the target membrane, the hydrophilic, globular C 9 partially unfolds to expose a hydrophobic lipid interaction domain. Several copies of amphiphilic C 9 subsequently polymerize to form the characteristic ring-like MAC. Using a combined photoaffinity label and computer modeling approach, two amphipathic helices in a segment encompassing the amino acids 293 - 334 have been predicted to interact with membrane lipids. To elucidate the mechanism of C 9 lipid binding and <b>insertion,</b> site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> was used to change the amphipathic character of the helices. While some conservative amino acid replacements such as Thr 307 by a Leu were tolerated and yielded fully active C 9 when expressed in COS cells, successive changes of Leu 305 into Val, Ala, and Glu on the hydrophobic site of the first helix gave rise to only partly or not secreted C 9. All non-conservative amino acid replacements introduced {{on either side of the}} helices resulted in non-secreted C 9 that was subsequently degraded intracellularly, indicating the importance of the correct folding of the presumptive transmembrane domain during biosynthesis. A natural secretion-incompetent mutant was found in which Val 293, located in the proposed lipid-binding region, was lacking. Taken together, these findings suggest that the high incidence of homozygous C 9 deficiencies may be due to a blockage in intracellular transport and secretion due to point mutations in this 'hot spot' region of the molecule...|$|R

To elucidate the function of the NEC 1 gene, co-suppression was employed for down-regulation of NEC 1 expression, and transposon <b>insertion</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> was used to knock out the NEC 1 function. Among the transgenic plants and plants carrying dTph 1 inserted in the NEC 1 gene, an "early open anther" phenotype was observed. In this mutant phenotype, the anthers already open in young flower buds (1. 8 cm) that still contain immature pollen, resulting in poor pollen quality and impaired pollen release. The results obtained indicate that NEC 1 might be involved in the development of stomium cells, which are ruptured during the normal process of anther dehiscence to release mature pollen. Southern analysis revealed the presence of a highly homologous NEC 1 -like gene, named NEC 2, in the P. hybrida genome.

Previous studies have identified two serine proteases in S. pneumoniae, HtrA (high-temperature requirement A) and PrtA (cell wall-associated serine protease A), that contributed to virulence in models of pneumonia and intraperitoneal infection respectively. We here sought to identify additional S. pneumoniae serine proteases and determine their role in virulence. The S. pneumoniae D 39 genome contains five putative serine proteases, of which HtrA, Subtilase Family Protein (SFP) and PrtA were selected for insertional mutagenesis because they are predicted to be secreted and surface exposed. Mutant D 39 strains lacking serine proteases were constructed by in-frame <b>insertion</b> deletion <b>mutagenesis.</b> Pneumonia was induced by intranasal infection of mice with wild-type or mutant D 39. After high dose infection, only D 39 DeltahtrA showed reduced virulence, as reflected by strongly reduced bacterial loads, diminished dissemination and decreased lung inflammation. D 39 DeltaprtA induced significantly less lung inflammation together with smaller infiltrated lung surface, but without influencing bacterial loads. After low dose infection, D 39 DeltahtrA again showed strongly reduced bacterial loads; notably, pneumococcal burdens were also modestly lower in lungs after infection with D 39 Deltasfp. These data confirm the important role for HtrA in S. pneumoniae virulence. PrtA contributes to lung damage in high dose pneumonia; it does not however contribute to bacterial outgrowth in pneumococcal pneumonia. SFP may facilitate S. pneumoniae growth after low dose infection...|$|R
40|$|Membranes are {{hydrophobic}} {{barriers that}} define the outer boundaries and internal compartments of living cells. Membrane proteins are the gates in these barriers, and they perform vital functions in the highly regulated transport of matter and information across membranes. Membrane proteins destined for the endoplasmic reticulum are targeted either co- or post-translationally to the Sec 61 translocon, the major translocation machinery in eukaryotic cells, which allows for lateral partitioning of hydrophobic segments into the lipid bilayer. This thesis aims to acquire insights into the mechanism of membrane protein insertion {{and the role of}} different translocon components in targeting, insertion and topogenesis, using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. By measuring the insertion efficiency of a set of model proteins, we studied the sequence requirements for Sec 61 -mediated insertion of an α-helical transmembrane segment and established a ‘biological hydrophobicity scale’ in yeast, which describes the individual contributions of the 20 amino acids to <b>insertion.</b> Systematic <b>mutagenesis</b> and photo-crosslinking of the Sec 61 translocon revealed key residues in the lateral gate that modulate the threshold hydrophobicity for membrane insertion and transmembrane segment orientation. Further, my studies demonstrate that the translocon-associated Sec 62 is important not only for post-translational targeting, but also for the insertion and topogenesis of moderately hydrophobic signal anchor proteins and the C-terminal translocation of multi-spanning membrane proteins.
