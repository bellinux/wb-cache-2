5|$|According to Microsoft sources, BitLocker {{does not}} contain an {{intentionally}} built-in backdoor; without a backdoor {{there is no way}} for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft. In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with Microsoft to get one introduced, although Microsoft developer Niels Ferguson and other Microsoft spokesmen state that they will not grant the wish to have one added. Microsoft engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, written request was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the hard-copy of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES <b>encryption</b> <b>algorithm</b> used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for scrutiny by Microsoft partners and enterprises, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E

25|$|PGP {{can be used}} to send {{messages}} confidentially. For this, PGP combines symmetric-key encryption and public-key encryption. The message is encrypted using a symmetric <b>encryption</b> <b>algorithm,</b> which requires a symmetric key. Each symmetric key is used only once and is also called a session key. The message and its session key are sent to the receiver. The session key must be sent to the receiver so they know how to decrypt the message, but to protect it during transmission it is encrypted with the receiver's public key. Only the private key belonging to the receiver can decrypt the session key.|$|E

The negotiation of a shared secret is both secure (the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers and cannot be obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the middle of the connection) and reliable (no attacker can modify the communications during the negotiation without being detected).|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: When we send any {{video data}} over the network it consumes more time. This {{is due to}} the huge size of the video file when {{compared}} to text file. Therefore, video data should be compressed before sending to the destination. Another important factor during data transfer is security. Joint compression and encryption is employed to enable faster and secured transmission of video data. Approach: Compression and <b>encryption</b> <b>algorithms</b> can be classified into two main categories: Independent encryption technique and joint compression and encryption technique. Independent encryption techniques can further be classified as heavy weight and light weight <b>encryption</b> <b>algorithms.</b> There are many algorithms available in the joint compression and encryption technique. Comparative study of the above mentioned algorithms is done in this study. Results: Based on our study, found joint compression and <b>encryption</b> <b>algorithms</b> reduced 40 % of the memory storage size and they increased execution speed up to 21 %. Conclusion: Joint compression and <b>encryption</b> <b>algorithms</b> perform better in terms of speed and security when compared to independent <b>encryption</b> <b>algorithms.</b> This is because they employ compression before encryption...|$|R

This paper examines QoS in terms of lost packet ratio, latency and jitter using different <b>encryption</b> <b>algorithms</b> along with firewalling at the IP layer. The results of laboratory tests indicate that the impact on the overall performance of VoIP depends upon the bandwidth available and encryption used. Findings include the need for the provision of bandwidth for encryption, and even when adequate bandwidth is provided <b>encryption</b> <b>algorithms</b> can increase lost packet ratios and packet latency, and reduce. Overall, the results indicate the implementation of <b>encryption</b> <b>algorithms</b> may degrade the voice quality even if bandwidth is adequate...|$|R
25|$|Blowfish's key {{schedule}} starts by initializing the P-array and S-boxes with values {{derived from}} the hexadecimal digits of pi, which contain no obvious pattern (see nothing up my sleeve number). The secret key is then, byte by byte, cycling the key if necessary, XORed with all the P-entries in order. A 64-bit all-zero block is then encrypted with the algorithm as it stands. The resultant ciphertext replaces P1 and P2. The same ciphertext is then encrypted again with the new subkeys, and the new ciphertext replaces P3 and P4. This continues, replacing the entire P-array and all the S-box entries. In all, the Blowfish <b>encryption</b> <b>algorithm</b> will run 521 times to generate all the subkeys - about 4KB of data is processed.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{modifications}} to the original protocols, like False Start (adopted and enabled by Google Chrome) or Snap Start, reportedly introduced limited TLS protocol downgrade attacks or allowed {{modifications to}} the cipher suite list sent by the client to the server. In doing so, an attacker might succeed in influencing the cipher suite selection {{in an attempt to}} downgrade the cipher suite negotiated to use either a weaker symmetric <b>encryption</b> <b>algorithm</b> or a weaker key exchange. A paper presented at an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) conference on computer and communications security in 2012 demonstrated that the False Start extension was at risk: in certain circumstances it could allow an attacker to recover the encryption keys offline and to access the encrypted data.|$|E
25|$|While the CRIME {{attack was}} {{presented}} as a general attack that could work effectively against {{a large number of}} protocols, including but not limited to TLS, and application-layer protocols such as SPDY or HTTP, only exploits against TLS and SPDY were demonstrated and largely mitigated in browsers and servers. The CRIME exploit against HTTP compression has not been mitigated at all, even though the authors of CRIME have warned that this vulnerability might be even more widespread than SPDY and TLS compression combined. In 2013 a new instance of the CRIME attack against HTTP compression, dubbed BREACH, was announced. Based on the CRIME attack a BREACH attack can extract login tokens, email addresses or other sensitive information from TLS encrypted web traffic in as little as 30 seconds (depending on the number of bytes to be extracted), provided the attacker tricks the victim into visiting a malicious web link or is able to inject content into valid pages the user is visiting (ex: a wireless network {{under the control of the}} attacker). All versions of TLS and SSL are at risk from BREACH regardless of the <b>encryption</b> <b>algorithm</b> or cipher used. Unlike previous instances of CRIME, which can be successfully defended against by turning off TLS compression or SPDY header compression, BREACH exploits HTTP compression which cannot realistically be turned off, as virtually all web servers rely upon it to improve data transmission speeds for users. This is a known limitation of TLS as it is susceptible to chosen-plaintext attack against the application-layer data it was meant to protect.|$|E

500|$|The {{notion of}} using public key {{cryptography}} for data kidnapping attacks was introduced in 1996 by Adam L. Young and Moti Yung. Young and Yung critiqued the failed AIDS Information Trojan that relied on symmetric cryptography alone, the fatal flaw being that the decryption key could be extracted from the Trojan, and implemented an experimental proof-of-concept cryptovirus on a Macintosh SE/30 that used RSA and the Tiny <b>Encryption</b> <b>Algorithm</b> (TEA) to hybrid encrypt the victim's data. Since public key crypto is used, the cryptovirus only contains the encryption key. The attacker keeps the corresponding private decryption key private. Young and Yung's original experimental cryptovirus had the victim send the asymmetric ciphertext to the attacker who deciphers it and returns the symmetric decryption key it contains to the victim for a fee. Long before electronic money existed Young and Yung proposed that electronic money could be extorted through encryption as well, stating that [...] "the virus writer can effectively hold {{all of the money}} ransom until half of it is given to him. Even if the e-money was previously encrypted by the user, it is of no use to the user if it gets encrypted by a cryptovirus". They referred to these attacks as being [...] "cryptoviral extortion", an overt attack that {{is part of a larger}} class of attacks in a field called cryptovirology, which encompasses both overt and covert attacks. The cryptoviral extortion protocol was inspired by the forced-symbiotic relationship between H. R. Giger's facehugger and its host in the movie Alien.|$|E
