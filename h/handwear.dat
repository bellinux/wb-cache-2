The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of <b>handwear</b> of fencing gloves and posture on four performance measures in foil fencing. Eight male fencers were tested in an experiment. Four measures of fencing performance were collected and analyzed. They were the grip and pinch forces under four hand postures and the hitting scores and motion time under a fundamental attacking scenario. Analysis of variance was conducted. Duncan’s multiple range tests were conducted if a significance level of 0. 05 was reached. The results showed that both the <b>handwear</b> condition and posture were significant on the grip force. The effects of posture on grip and pinch forces were both significant. <b>Handwear</b> affected hitting accuracy significantly. The effect of <b>handwear</b> on pinch force was not significant. The hitting scores for both the glove I and II conditions were significantly higher than the bare hand condition. The results in this study supported that selection of the thinnest glove resulted in relatively better performance for the fencers...|$|E

40|$|For {{all types}} of {{clothing}} and body worn technologies {{it is important to}} consider how they integrate and interact with the complex shapes that form the unique profile of the human body. This interaction determines the fit of these products and it is often difficult to generate a fit that can simultaneously accommodate these complex shapes. Achieving the correct fit is determined by a number of different factors that must be combined appropriately to create the fit associated with a particular product. This is particularly applicable to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to ensure it provides protection while maintaining comfort, mobility and good interaction with the surrounding environment. Integrating suitable anthropometric data into the design and manufacture of this type of clothing plays a critical role in achieving a good fit. By using various processes of Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacture (CAM), the detail contained within these data can be quickly and accurately transferred into physical tools. The aim of this study was to demonstrate and validate a method of enhancing the fit of PPE <b>handwear.</b> This has been achieved through an action research strategy using descriptive and practical research methods. The research tools primarily used are case studies, used to demonstrate how manually collected 2 D anthropometric data can be used to generate computer models that represent these data in a 3 D form. The products of the case studies are tools that have been introduced into the design and manufacture processes of commercial <b>handwear</b> manufacturing environments. The tools have successfully been used to produce gloves using two different manufacturing methods and been assessed to analyse their fit. An improvement in fit for the gloves has been quantified through user trials to determine the level of increased performance afforded to the wearer. The conclusions drawn from the case studies demonstrate that the integration of anthropometric data and CAD/CAM can greatly influence the fit of <b>handwear</b> and improve the iterative processes of its design. However, the data alone does not achieve this as the added integration of tacit knowledge related to glove design is needed to ensure the correct properties are included to the meet the needs of the target population. The methods developed in the case studies have the potential to be applied to other products where fit and interaction with the human body are important design considerations.

Finally, future trends in design and production are introduced. In each case, best practice from Human Factors and the application of available technologies are described to provide the optimum compromise within a final design solution...|$|E

40|$|Hand-force {{prediction}} {{is an important}} technology for hand-oriented user interface systems. Specifically, surface electromyography (sEMG) is a promising technique for hand-force prediction, which requires a sensor with a small design space and low hardware costs. In this study, we applied several artificial neural-network (ANN) regression models with different numbers of neurons and hidden layers and evaluated handgrip forces by using a dynamometer. A <b>handwear</b> with dry electrodes on the dorsal interosseous muscles was used for our evaluation. Eleven healthy subjects participated in our experiments. sEMG signals with six different levels of forces from 0 [*]N to 200 [*]N and maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) are measured to train and test our ANN regression models. We evaluated three different methods (intrasession, intrasubject, and intersubject evaluation), and our experimental results show a high correlation (0. 840, 0. 770, and 0. 789 each) between the predicted forces and observed forces, which are normalized by the MVC for each subject. Our results also reveal that ANNs with deeper layers of up to four hidden layers show fewer errors in intrasession and intrasubject evaluations...|$|E
