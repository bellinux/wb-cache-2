5|$|In 1918, Brinkley {{opened a}} 16-room clinic in Milford, where he won over the locals {{immediately}} by paying good wages, invigorating {{the local economy}} and making <b>house</b> <b>calls</b> on patients afflicted with the virulent and deadly outbreak of the 1918 flu pandemic. For all his later infamy as a charlatan, accounts of his success at nursing flu victims back to health, and the lengths to which he went to treat them, were resoundingly positive.|$|E
5|$|According to Diane Dimond of Hard Copy, Torbiner's {{records show}} that Robinul and Vistarol was {{administered}} instead of sodium amytal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was investigating Torbiner's administration of drugs in <b>house</b> <b>calls,</b> where he mostly gave patients morphine and Demerol. His credentials with the Board of Dental Examiners indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, {{but he had not}} adhered to those restrictions. For instance, he had given general anesthetic to Barry Rothman during hair-transplant procedures. Torbiner had introduced Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed dental work.|$|E
5|$|During that era, {{hospital}} {{nurses and}} midwives were {{trained on the}} job. Schwester Selma trained and supervised all the nurses, operating-room nurses, and midwives in the hospital, teaching the former {{how to make a}} hospital bed and the latter how to diaper newborns and swaddle infants. Sometimes she also substituted for the midwives, who did not live on the premises. For many years, Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach's right-hand assistant in the areas of uterine curettages, tracheotomies, and ritual circumcisions, accompanied him on <b>house</b> <b>calls,</b> and stood in for him as hospital director when he was away. From 1916 to 1930 she was also in charge of supplies and building maintenance, and making sure the kashrut in the kitchen met Dr. Wallach's strict standards.|$|E

5|$|McConnell-Mills {{was born}} Frances Mary McConnell in 1900 in Monument, Colorado. Her {{father was a}} {{physician}} and a pharmacist, and often took Frances {{with him when he}} made <b>house</b> <b>calls</b> to patients. She was sent to live with her aunt and grandfather so that she could attend Colorado Springs High School; she graduated at the age of 15 and was awarded a full scholarship to the University of Denver. She received a bachelor's degree from the university in 1918, aged 17, and graduated again with a master's degree in chemistry when she was 19, making her the university's youngest graduate with a master's degree at the time. In 1919, she began work as a teacher of chemistry, biology, geometry and trigonometry at Englewood High School.|$|E
25|$|When Mower was 15 years old, {{his uncle}} fell ill {{and a family}} {{physician}} made frequent <b>house</b> <b>calls</b> to treat Mower's uncle.

25|$|Many modern Japanese women {{lack the}} skill {{to put on}} a kimono unaided: the typical woman's kimono outfit {{consists}} of twelve or more separate pieces that are worn, matched, and secured in prescribed ways, and the assistance of licensed professional kimono dressers may be required. Called upon mostly for special occasions, kimono dressers both work out of hair salons and make <b>house</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|E

25|$|In March 1934, Manon and {{her mother}} {{traveled}} to Venice for the Easter holiday. There, Manon contracted polio, which left her totally paralyzed. She returned to Vienna, where she recovered some use of her arms and hands. Still determined to act, teachers from the famous Reinhardt-Seminar made <b>house</b> <b>calls.</b> Alma also encouraged visitors, including a younger Austrofascist, a bureaucrat named Erich Cyhlar, to court Manon {{in the hopes that}} pending nuptials would compel her to walk again.|$|E
25|$|Boarman {{built his}} first home out of lumber and lived rough with his only luxuries being a coal stove and {{hurricane}} lamps he ordered though the local general store. As a young doctor traveling the countryside he faced many obstacles including severe weather {{conditions such as}} floods and thunderstorms, and especially the harsh winters of the Upper Midwest, as well as poor roads and no telegraph system. Harris made countless <b>house</b> <b>calls</b> and delivered over 3,000 babies in his near 60-year career.|$|E
25|$|It was a {{cultural}} norm {{for women to}} have their babies at their home or their mother's home, and professional medical attention was not sought unless there was a problem. This meant that when Allison handled deliveries, {{they were more likely}} to be due to prenatal complications. To treat these cases, Dr. Allison often needed to leave the hospital to make <b>house</b> <b>calls.</b> Some women died due to complications in their homes. Over time, more pregnant women went to the hospital for prenatal care and delivery.|$|E

25|$|Carney won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his 1974 {{performance}} as Harry Coombes, {{an elderly man}} going {{on the road with}} his pet cat, in Harry and Tonto. He beat out Albert Finney, Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson, and Al Pacino for the Oscar that year. It was presented to him at the 47th Academy Awards on April 8, 1975 by actress Glenda Jackson, with whom Carney would co-star in the comedy <b>House</b> <b>Calls</b> in 1978. Carney also won a Golden Globe award for his Harry and Tonto performance.|$|E
25|$|Partway {{through the}} second season, the show was moved back to its {{original}} earlier time. CBS executives wanted to free up the prized post-M*A*S*H slot for <b>House</b> <b>Calls</b> (with former M*A*S*H star Wayne Rogers). They also felt that {{the rock and roll}} music and the sex appeal of Loni Anderson were better-suited to the earlier slot, which at that time was thought of as mostly aimed at young people. The mid-season timeslot change didn't affect the show's success; WKRP finished at #22 in the ratings for its second year. For the next two seasons, however, the writers and producers often had to fight CBS over what kind of content was appropriate for a show in the so-called family hour.|$|E
25|$|Marlowe {{returns to}} Bay City to re-interview Chris Lavery, given the new {{information}} from the hotel employees that contradicts his prior statement. At the house he finds Mrs. Fallbrook, who says she is the owner and has found a gun on the stairs. Once she has left, Marlowe ascertains that the gun has been fired six times and, after a search, finds Lavery murdered in the bathroom. Then {{he goes back to}} Kingsley, who offers him a fat bonus to prove Crystal didn't do it. Marlowe returns to Lavery's <b>house,</b> <b>calls</b> the police and reports the murder. Marlowe is interviewed by the police and is backhanded several times when he suggests that there was a cover-up of the death of Dr. Almore's wife.|$|E

A doctor based on the neighbouring island of Skye is available for <b>house</b> <b>calls</b> once a month. The roads on Canna are not metalled and are privately owned; local vehicles therefore do not require road tax. The previous footbridge to Sanday was destroyed by storms during 2005, and has recently {{been replaced by a}} road bridge. This allows vehicular access at all tide levels for the first time, although the road on Sanday is still covered by high tides. However, in 2017 an appeal was launched to raise funds for the reconstruction of the road on Sanday so that it is also available at high tide.|$|E
500|$|Laubenstein co-founded the Kaposi's Sarcoma Research Fund in 1983. The same year, she and Friedman-Kien {{arranged}} the first national-scale medical conference on AIDS at New York University. A collection of research {{presented at the}} conference was published in 1984 in a volume titled AIDS: The Epidemic of Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections, edited by Laubenstein and Friedman-Kien. In 1986, she and Jeffrey B. Greene founded a non-profit organization, Multitasking. The organization, which provided office services to businesses, employed AIDS patients who had lost their jobs because {{of the disease and}} helped them to find new positions. Greene called Laubenstein [...] "the ultimate AIDS physician" [...] because of the care she provided to her patients, often making <b>house</b> <b>calls</b> in her wheelchair. At a time when many physicians refused to see AIDS patients, Laubenstein's colleague James Wernz, an oncologist, affectionately noted that she was sometimes referred to as [...] "bitch on wheels" [...] because of her [...] "pushy" [...] attitude towards other doctors.|$|E
500|$|At that time, the Yellow River was flooding, causing {{widespread}} devastation to {{the people}} and the rice harvests. As Luan Da had claimed that he could dam the river, Emperor Wu felt that {{it would be wise to}} encourage the mystic to take up the task by quickly pleasing him. The emperor granted Luan Da the title of the General of Five Boons, and almost as an afterthought, three other such titles: the General of Heavenly Practitioners, the General of the Earth Practitioners, and General Grand Communicator. Emperor Wu also lavished gifts on him; he was granted the marquisate of Letong, giving him some 2,000 households to rule over, and the emperor also gave him a luxurious mansion, a thousand servants, opulent transportation, many decorations, a seal labelled [...] "General of Heavenly Way", and even the hand in marriage of Princess Wei Zifu, the emperor's eldest daughter, accompanied by a dowry estimated at 10,000 catties of gold. The emperor himself, along with envoys, members of the royal family, and high-ranking officials often invited Luan Da to dine or paid him <b>house</b> <b>calls</b> merely to ask how he was doing. With his marquisate and five generalships, Luan Da had become a man of great standing only a few months after his introduction to the emperor. He was no longer merely Emperor Wu's subject, but an envoy of the immortal beings with status equal to the emperor.|$|E
