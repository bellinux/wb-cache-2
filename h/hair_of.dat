5|$|The Alpine Spaniel {{was one of}} {{the direct}} genetic {{progenitors}} to the St. Bernard. Starting in 1830, the monks and canons of the Swiss Alps began crossing the dogs with the Newfoundland, expecting that the resulting offspring would have the longer <b>hair</b> <b>of</b> the Newfoundland and this would protect the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.|$|E

It is an unflinchingly realistic depiction of ageing and emphasises the furrowed skin and thinning <b>hair</b> <b>of</b> an overweight man who yet maintains his resolve and determination. He sits in three-quarter profile against a brown ground lit from the right, his fingers are pronounced and highly detailed, while the polish {{of his chair}} reflects light from an unseen window.|$|E

Negro qualified for the Rey de Reyes (2003) final, but La Parka, Jr. once again defeated him. In 2004, LLL was phased out in favor of a new super group known as La Legión Extranjera or the Foreign Legion in English, which meant that Los Vipers now regularly teamed with foreign wrestlers, especially NWA-TNA performers such as Abyss.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of the investigation <b>of</b> <b>hairs</b> in representatives <b>of</b> various sections of the genus Plantago L. (Andrzejewska-Golec and Świętosławski 1987, 1988, 1989 a, b, 1991, in press 2). It deals with the species of the related sections: Novorbis Decne (3 species) and Mesembrynia Decne (5 species). The investigated taxa of both sections have one type <b>of</b> headed <b>hair</b> (typical <b>of</b> the representatives of the genus Plantago) as well as three types of headless hairs: 1) 1 - 3 -celled-bristle-shaped, 2) consisting of several cells, and 3) multicellular-web-like. Only slight differences between the <b>hairs</b> <b>of</b> the investigated taxa of sections Novorbis and Mesembrynia were noticed. The <b>hairs</b> <b>of</b> the representatives of these sections are also similar to the <b>hairs</b> <b>of</b> representatives of another section, related to those mentioned above, viz.

Only approximately 50 % of the weight <b>of</b> the root <b>hairs</b> <b>of</b> legumes could {{be accounted for by}} sugar. Up to 80 % of the weight <b>of</b> root <b>hairs</b> from other sources could be accounted for by sugars. Protein made up 5 to 8 % of the weight <b>of</b> root <b>hairs</b> <b>of</b> dicots but only 1. 3 % in corn. Comparison between cell walls from various root cell types within legumes showed that the polysaccharide compositions of root epidermal, root hair, and root cortical cells were very similar.

5|$|Paul Taylor’s {{review in}} The Independent hails American Idiot as “the <b>Hair</b> <b>of</b> its generation”. Yet, {{as noted by}} Harry Lou in The Indianapolis Business Journal, “ts female {{characters}} are sketched even lighter than the main men are”. Although intended to empower the disillusioned youth of early 21st century America, American Idiot excludes the female voice from this discourse. This disempowering of the female {{is evident in the}} fact that the female leads are denied identity, let alone agency. Just one of the three is given a name, and all represent a stereotypical form of ‘woman’; the mother, the artistic muse, and the object of the voyeuristic male gaze.|$|E
5|$|Products {{collected}} from living horses include mare's milk, used {{by people with}} large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis. Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling. Drinking their own horses' blood allowed the Mongols to ride for {{extended periods of time}} without stopping to eat. The drug Premarin is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares' urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone replacement therapy. The tail <b>hair</b> <b>of</b> horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.|$|E

This leads him to discover he can groom dogs' hair, and later he styles the <b>hair</b> <b>of</b> the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce Edward, but scares him away. Joyce tells the neighborhood women that he attempted to seduce her, reducing their trust in him.

40|$|Hair and hair-coat {{properties}} are significant {{because they are}} inputs to heat and mass transfer models of animals. They work as an interface between animal and animal hair coat. Moreover, hair and hair-coat properties help us to select animal breed for different environment. Therefore, {{it is useful to}} identify heat tolerant cows. For hair and hair-coat properties, there are physical properties (hair length, <b>hair</b> diameter, density <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> coat, depth <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> coat, and weight <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> coat) and optical properties (absorptivity, reflectivity, and transmissivity). There are many factors such as body location <b>of</b> <b>hairs,</b> climates, and breeds that affect physical properties <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> coat <b>of</b> cows.

5|$|The product {{claimed to}} be the strongest beer made is Schorschbräu's 2011 Schorschbock 57 with 57,5%. It was preceded by The End of History, a 55% Belgian ale, made by BrewDog in 2010. The same company had {{previously}} made Sink The Bismarck!, a 41% abv IPA, and Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a 32% abv Imperial stout. Each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing, in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed, until the desired strength is reached, a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer. The German brewery Schorschbräu's Schorschbock, a 31% abv eisbock, and <b>Hair</b> <b>of</b> the Dog's Dave, a 29% abv barley wine made in 1994, used the same fractional freezing method. A 60% abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a Dutch brewery in July 2010.|$|E

Chapter five details the distribution and wholesale centers of the industry and the terms and regulations used. Chapter six details the selection and grading of the cuts, beginning with the most popular Wiltshire cut. Chapter seven and eight details the retail distribution of the bacon, and dividing the Wiltshire cut into different cuts and pricing. Chapter nine concludes with the retail distribution of the American and Canadian cuts. The book includes fold-out anatomical charts that were popular during the time.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden <b>hair</b> <b>of</b> the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E

5|$|While the Grand Prince is away in Lithuania, his power-hungry {{younger brother}} forms an {{allegiance}} {{with a group}} of Tatars and raids Vladimir. We see flashbacks of the Grand Prince and his brother attending a religious service in the church, and see the rivalry and animosity between them. The invasion of the combined armed forces on horseback and the resulting carnage is shown in great detail. The city is burned, the citizens are murdered and women raped and killed. One scene shows a horse falling from a flight of stairs and being stabbed by a spear. Another shows a cow being set on fire. Foma narrowly escapes being killed in the city and escapes into the nearby countryside, but as he is crossing a river he is shot in the back with an arrow and killed. The Tatars force their way into the barricaded church, now fully decorated with Andrei's paintings, where the majority of the citizens have taken refuge. The Tatars show no mercy and massacre the people inside and burn all the painted wooden altarpieces. Andrei saves Durochka from being raped by killing a Tatar with an axe. The Bishop's messenger is cruelly tortured to make him reveal the location of the city's gold, which he refuses to do. After being repeatedly burned, he has liquid metal from a melted crucifix poured into his mouth and is dragged away tied to a horse. In the aftermath only Andrei and Durochka are left alive in the church. Andrei imagines a conversation with the dead Theophanes the Greek, lamenting the loss of his work and the evil of mankind, while Durochka distractedly plaits the <b>hair</b> <b>of</b> a dead woman. Andrei decides to give up painting and takes a vow of silence to atone for killing another man.|$|E
