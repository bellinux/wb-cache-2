5|$|Brachiopod fossils {{have been}} useful {{indicators}} of climate changes during the Paleozoic era. When global temperatures were low, {{as in much}} of the Ordovician, the large difference <b>in</b> <b>temperature</b> between equator and poles created different collections of fossils at different latitudes. On the other hand, warmer periods, such much of the Silurian, created smaller difference in temperatures, and all seas at the low to middle latitudes were colonized by the same few brachiopod species.|$|E
5|$|Climate is the {{statistics}} of weather {{over long periods}} of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation <b>in</b> <b>temperature,</b> humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region {{over long periods of}} time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} Triton's limb as it passed in front of stars. These observations indicated {{the presence of a}} denser atmosphere than was deduced from Voyager 2 data. Other observations have shown an increase <b>in</b> <b>temperature</b> by 5% from 1989 to 1998. These observations indicate Triton is approaching an unusually warm summer season that happens only once every few hundred years. Theories for this warming include a change of frost patterns on Triton's surface and a change in ice albedo, which would allow more heat to be absorbed. Another theory argues the changes <b>in</b> <b>temperature</b> are a result of deposition of dark, red material from geological processes. Because Triton's Bond albedo is among the highest within the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{environmental}} parameters like changes <b>in</b> <b>temperature</b> and prior residence may affect the cichlid's territorial aggression. The convict cichlids are more aggressive at 30°C as opposed to 26°C, which may be {{explained by the fact that}} convict cichlids tend to set up their breeding sites and spawn at 30°C.|$|E
5|$|Limousin cattle {{evolved in}} the French region now known as Limousin. The region {{comprises}} the historical French provinces of Limousin and Marche, which include the departments of Corrèze in its entirety, most of Creuse, and parts of Haute-Vienne. Limousin cattle adapted to the local hilly conditions of acidic soils and weakly mineralised granite, with large variations <b>in</b> <b>temperature.</b> These factors {{led to the development}} of a hardy breed with an unusually thin but solid bone.|$|E

The perfect {{temperature}} and humidity level is maintained to ensure the longest possible lifespan for each custom mould. Custom moulds, such as those used for rubber injection moulding, are stored <b>in</b> <b>temperature</b> and humidity controlled environments to prevent warping.|$|E

5|$|Now {{known as}} Leona Marshall Libby, she became {{interested}} in ecological and environmental issues, and she devised a method of using the isotope ratios of Oxygen-18 to Oxygen-16, Carbon-13 to Carbon-12, and Deuterium to Hydrogen in tree rings to study changes <b>in</b> <b>temperature</b> and rainfall patterns hundreds of years before records were kept, {{opening the door to}} the study of climate change.|$|E
5|$|Once snowflakes {{land and}} accumulate, they undergo {{metamorphosis}} with changes <b>in</b> <b>temperature</b> and coalesce into a snowpack. The {{characteristics of the}} snowpack reflect the changed nature of the constituent snow crystals.|$|E
5|$|Rainbands are {{cloud and}} {{precipitation}} areas which are significantly elongated. Rainbands can be stratiform or convective, and are generated by differences <b>in</b> <b>temperature.</b> When noted on weather radar imagery, this precipitation elongation {{is referred to}} as banded structure. Rainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion, and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature.|$|E
50|$|The warming {{also affects}} insects and animals. The change <b>in</b> <b>temperatures</b> can affect many aspects from {{the times that}} insects emerge {{throughout}} the year to {{the changes in the}} habitats of animals throughout seasonal changes. In Maine, the loss of certain habitats and the increase <b>in</b> <b>temperatures,</b> especially <b>in</b> the colder seasons, encourages the survival of ticks that harm the moose population.|$|R

5|$|The {{ability of}} animals {{including}} fish, lizards and frogs {{to change their}} colours quickly is discussed.

5|$|The island's lush vegetation, {{a product}} of its mild climate and {{frequent}} rainfall, earns it the sobriquet the Emerald Isle. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is temperate avoiding the extremes <b>in</b> <b>temperature</b> of many other areas {{in the world at}} similar latitudes. This {{is a result of the}} moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the South-Western Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} {{only works}} {{if the air}} is cooler than the reference temperature. If the air is hotter than that, the system becomes a positive feedback cycle, the body's fire is put out, and death follows. The system as described damps out fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>temperature.</b> Aristotle however predicted that his system would cause lung oscillation (breathing), which is possible given extra assumptions such as of delays or non-linear responses.|$|E
5|$|The most talked-about {{applications}} {{of these models}} {{in recent years have}} been their use to infer the consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide (see greenhouse gas).
