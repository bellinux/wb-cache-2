When the plasmon wave pass through the <b>gold</b> <b>nanoparticle,</b> the charge density in the wave and the electron I the gold interacted and resulted in higher energy response, so called electron coupling.

40|$|Excited-state {{interactions}} between chlorophyll a (Chla) and <b>gold</b> <b>nanoparticles</b> have been studied.

Photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism is supported by the electrochemical modulation of fluorescence of Chla. In absence of an applied bias, Chla cast on gold film, as a result of electron transfer, exhibits a very weak fluorescence. However, upon negatively charging the gold nanocore by external bias, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed. The negatively charged <b>gold</b> <b>nanoparticles</b> create a barrier and suppress the electron-transfer process from excited Chla to <b>gold</b> <b>nanoparticles,</b> resulting in an increase in radiative process. Nanosecond laser flash experiments of Chla in the presence of <b>gold</b> <b>nanoparticles</b> and fullerene (C 60) have demonstrated that Au nanoparticles, besides accepting electrons, can also mediate or shuttle electrons to another acceptor. Taking advantage of these properties of <b>gold</b> <b>nanoparticles,</b> a photoelectrochemical cell based on Chla and <b>gold</b> <b>nanoparticles</b> is constructed.
