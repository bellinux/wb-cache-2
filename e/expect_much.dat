5|$|Prussia {{tried to}} take {{opportunity}} of the Russian Empire's wars with the Ottoman Empire and Sweden and move the weak Commonwealth into its sphere of influence. Some factions in the Commonwealth deemed {{this as an opportunity}} to shake free from decades of Russian control. That said, Prussia did not <b>expect</b> <b>much</b> from the alliance, not even that it would pass. When the treaty was first proposed to the Great Sejm by Prussian ambassador Ludwig Heinrich Buchholtz on 13 October 1788, Prussians expected that it would cause long and fruitless debate which only outcome would be to ensure the weakening of Russian (and to a lesser degree, Austrian) position in Poland. Overall, for Prussia, the alliance with Poland was only one of several potential options; but for some Polish politicians it became a new, and increasingly, only available strategy. The reception of Prussian proposal by the Sejm exceeded their expectations, and it has significantly strengthened the Patriotic Party. For the next year or so, Prussians decided to delay taking any clear action, keeping their options open. Buchholtz was also reprimanded for allowing things to go too far, and another Prussian diplomat, Girolamo Lucchesini, was sent to Warsaw to aid him.|$|E
25|$|De Córdoba {{was born}} at Montilla {{in what is now}} the {{province}} of Córdoba, the son of Pedro Fernández de Córdoba (Count of Aguilar) and his wife Elvira de Herrera. He and his older brother, Alonso, were orphaned when they were young. As the younger brother in a society practicing primogeniture, Gonzalo could not <b>expect</b> <b>much</b> in the way of inherited wealth or titles, and of his two options – the church or the military – he chose the latter. He was first attached to the household of Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, the half-brother of King Henry IV of Castile. After Alfonso's death in 1468 Córdoba devoted himself to Alfonso's sister, Isabella of Castile.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch fleet {{arrived in}} two groups: one of 24 ships in {{formation}} and another, far apart and about seven. Both were to windward of the Spanish, {{so they had}} the advantage of the wind. Escorting the convoy, a dozen ships including two stand by power and size, crescent-shaped {{to make way for the}} merchant, sufficiently armed for combat, but which should not be exposed for their precious cargo not be in cases of absolute necessity. But it seemed that those nine Spanish ships were to be a major obstacle to the Dutch. Fadrique could not <b>expect</b> <b>much</b> from its low power: the only good pataches will, expertise and valor of their commanders could have some value in combat, and six ships were medium galleons in all respects, little or more or equivalent to the twelve ships of the Dutch escort. The most important ship of the engagement was the Spanish flagship Santa Teresa, a vessel much larger and more powerful than all the present on both sides.|$|E

500|$|In Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the two {{are already}} together, but it is {{explained}} that Dexter started dating her solely to improve his [...] "disguise" [...] as a normal person. Because she was brutalized by her now-jailed ex-husband, Rita fears intimacy and does not <b>expect</b> <b>much</b> of Dexter; this suits the asexual Dexter perfectly. By the novel's climax, Dexter admits that he is fond of her children, Astor and Cody, the closest he can get to feeling love. By a humorous misunderstanding, the couple become engaged in Dearly Devoted Dexter and married {{at the end of}} Dexter in the Dark. In the books, Rita is scatter-brained and easily upset, prone to speaking in disjointed, rambling sentences that Dexter often finds incomprehensible. The only quality that Dexter truly appreciates about her is that she is an excellent cook. She is a physical fitness buff; she and Dexter regularly go for [...] runs, long bike rides, and weightlifting sessions together. In the fifth book, Dexter is Delicious, she gives birth to Dexter's daughter Lily Anne. In Dearly Devoted Dexter, Dexter discovers that Cody and Astor are budding sociopaths and decides to provide them with the same [...] "guidance" [...] that his adoptive father Harry gave to him; namely, to teach them how to be careful, efficient killers of those who [...] "deserve it". Rita is kept in the dark about the true nature of their relationship. She suspects that something is wrong with the children when she discovers them torturing a cat, but Dexter is able to reassure her that they didn't understand what they were doing. The television series is based on Darkly Dreaming Dexter. In Dexter's Final Cut, Dexter has an affair with TV star Jackie Forrest, and briefly considers leaving Rita. At the end of the novel, however, both Rita and Jackie are murdered by Robert Chase, a pedophile intent on kidnapping Astor.|$|E

I can't rave about this film enough—this is passionate filmmaking at its best. One of the best foreign films, heck, one of the best films I have seen", while Jonathan Rosenbaum of The Chicago Reader stated, [...] "About as entertaining as a no-brainer can be—a lot more fun, for my money, than a cornball theme-park ride like Speed, and every bit as fast moving.

2500|$|From the {{perspective}} of the Indian Army officers on the ground in Basra, it was time to strike. Their intelligence reports showed that the only troops blocking their advance upriver were the battered and demoralized remnants of the two divisions I.E.F. [...] "D" [...] had defeated at the battles of Nasiriyeh and Qurna. Furthermore, it was unlikely that the Ottoman divisions could <b>expect</b> <b>much</b> support from local populations. Soldiers in the Ottoman Divisions were conscripts, rarely paid and generally under-supplied. The conscripts from the Anatolian provinces were looked on as occupiers, while conscripts from the Kurdish and Arab provinces were likely to be more sympathetic to Arab or Kurdish national movements that were starting, and their morale suffer correspondingly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first visit}} by de Gaulle to Truman in America {{was not a}} success.

But Truman, who admitted that his feelings towards the French were becoming 'less and less friendly', {{went on to say that}} under the circumstances, the French could not <b>expect</b> <b>much</b> economic aid and refused to accept de Gaulle's request for control of the west bank of the Rhine. During the argument which followed, de Gaulle reminded Truman that the [...] US was using the French port of Noumea in New Caledonia as a base against the Japanese.|$|E
2500|$|The Era commented, [...] "the {{libretto}} as a {{whole is}} very weak and loosely constructed."

[...] The staging was also criticised: The Times stated, [...] "The ghost scene ... of which preliminary notices and hints of the initiated had led one to <b>expect</b> <b>much,</b> was a very tame affair." [...] The Era thought Sullivan's score [...] "far from being fresh and spontaneous as is his wont".|$|E

2500|$|Highly {{praised by}} all was Petula Clark, whom Ebert {{described}} as [...] "a surprise. I {{knew she could}} sing, but I didn't <b>expect</b> <b>much</b> more. She is a fresh addition to the movies: a handsome profile, a bright personality, and a singing voice as unique {{in its own way}} as Streisand's." [...] In the Chicago Reader, David Kehr opined she [...] "had every right to a distinguished career in musicals." [...] John Mahoney of The Hollywood Reporter said she [...] "invites no comparisons, bringing to her interpretation of Sharon her own distinctive freshness and form of delivery." [...] In the New York Daily News, Wanda Hale cited her [...] "winsome charm which comes through despite a somewhat reactive role." [...] Joseph Morgenstern of Newsweek said she [...] "looks lovely" [...] and [...] "sings beautifully, with an occasional startling reference to the phrasing and timbre of Ella Logan's original performance." [...] Variety observed, [...] "Miss Clark gives a good performance and she sings the beautiful songs like a nightingale." [...] Clearly, in the United States at least, Clark was known only as a singer, although she had appeared as an actress in British films since she was a child.|$|E
2500|$|As the 1950s began, {{competition}} {{increased from}} airlines, buses, and private cars. [...] Passenger numbers began to dwindle, especially during off-peak periods, and the Railways Department began to investigate railcar alternatives {{that would be}} better suited to the service. [...] In February 1956, just over {{ten years after the}} Picton Express began operating, it was replaced by the much faster RM class 88 seater railcars. [...] The Fiat 88 seat railcars, however, proved expensive and time-consuming to maintain, and from [...] 1967 began to be phased out with Picton route reverting to older Vulcan railcars and summer passenger trains. The Picton service was regarded as a local service for North Canterbury and Malborough locals and for their convenience and because of an agreement with the Union Steam Ship company not to compete with its Lyttelton Wellington steamer express Ferry service, no southbound ferry-rail connection was available at Picton and only a limited connection with the 6:45 pm ferry northbound. When the railcars wore out in the 1970s, they were replaced by a carriage train, which was introduced partly because of the abandonment of the rival Lyttelton Wellington steamer express, with the withdrawal of the 'Rangitira' in 1976 and this reborn Picton express proved something of a success to the amazement of the Railways management who did not <b>expect,</b> <b>much</b> patronage, given the early morning departures in 1976-7 due to track damage and repairs and this train was later rebranded as the TranzCoastal. [...] Before the rebranding, this carriage train was sometimes also referred to as the Picton Express.|$|E
2500|$|Wrongful {{dismissal}} {{refers to}} a termination of employment which contravenes a contract's terms, whether expressly agreed or implied by the courts. This depends on construction of the contract, read {{in the context of}} the statutory charter of rights for employees in the ERA 1996. In the old common law cases, the only term implied by the courts regarding termination was that employers had to give reasonable notice, and what was [...] "reasonable" [...] essentially depended on the professional status of the employee. In Creen v Wright, Lord Coleridge CJ held that a master mariner was entitled to a month's notice, though lower class workers could probably <b>expect</b> <b>much</b> less, [...] "respectable" [...] employees could expect more, and the period between wage payments would be a guide. Now the ERA 1996 section 86 prescribes that an employee should receive one week's notice before dismissal after one month's work, two weeks' notice after two years' work, and so forth up to twelve weeks for twelve years. The employer can give pay in lieu of notice, so long as the weeks' wages for the notice are paid in full. Often, contracts of employment contain express terms regarding a proper disciplinary procedure to be followed if someone is to be dismissed for disputes at work. Dismissals will usually be regarded as both wrongful and unfair if a procedure for dismissal is not followed. If a contractual disciplinary procedure is not followed, the employee may claim damages for the time it would have taken and the potential that she would still be employed. In Societe Generale, London Branch v Geys, the Supreme Court affirmed that a wrongful repudiation of a contract by the employer would not automatically terminate the agreement, because to do so would be to reward the wrongdoer. Only if an employee accepts the purported termination will the contract end. Until then the employer is liable for paying wages, and other terms of the contract, such as dismissal procedures, will survive.|$|E
