25|$|The {{balance between}} good and evil is {{correlated}} to the idea of purity and pollution. Purity is held to be of the very essence of godliness. Pollution's very point is to destroy purity through the death of a human.

25|$|In {{the chapter}} about A Folk Tale in My Theatre Life (Mit Teaterliv), Bournonville makes his {{attitude}} {{to the present}} and the past clear: he indicates that our practical and rather unpoetic times (which seem about to precipitate a period of literary and artistic crop failure on the very lands that were once the richest soil of the imagination) art has fallen by the wayside. The poetic past {{has been replaced by a}} 'hypercritical' present, as Bournonville himself writes, and it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> the artist to restore the spiritual, the poetry.|$|E

The English language is, by act of parliament, to be used in all the courts of judicature in Wales; and an English Bible is to be kept in all the churches in Wales, that by comparison with the Welsh, they may the sooner attain the knowledge of the English.|$|E
5000|$|In some cases, soke denoted {{the right}} to hold a court and in others only {{the right to}} receive the fines and forfeitures of the men over whom it was granted when they had been {{condemned}} {{in a court of}} competent jurisdiction.

25|$|According to Twelvers, {{defining}} {{and interpretation of}} Islamic jurisprudence {{is the responsibility of}} Muhammad and the twelve Imams. As the 12th Imam is in occultation, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> clerics to refer to the Islamic literature such as the Quran and hadith and identify legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law to provide means to deal with current issues from an Islamic perspective. In other words, Twelver clerics provide Guardianship of the Islamic Jurisprudence, which was defined by Muhammad and his twelve successors. This process is known as Ijtihad and the clerics are known as Marja, meaning reference. The labels Allamah and Ayatollah are in use for Twelver clerics.|$|E
25|$|Also, an {{extremely}} independent judiciary would lack judicial accountability, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> a public decision-maker {{to explain and}} justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or harm. Judges {{are not required to}} give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure that justice is upheld.|$|E
25|$|If a town {{wishes to}} obtain {{the title of a}} city the proper method of {{procedure}} is to address a petition to the King through the Home Office. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> the Home Secretary to submit such petitions to his Majesty and to advise his Majesty to the reply to be returned. It is a well-established principle that the grant of the title is only recommended in the case of towns of the first rank in population, size and importance, and having a distinctive character and identity of their own. At the present day, therefore, it is only rarely and in exceptional circumstances that the title is given.|$|E

25|$|A {{passenger}} train travels between stations where passengers may embark and disembark. The {{oversight of the}} train <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> a guard/train manager/conductor. Passenger trains are part of public transport and often make up the stem of the service, with buses feeding to stations. Passenger trains provide long-distance intercity travel, daily commuter trips, or local urban transit services. They even include a diversity of vehicles, operating speeds, right-of-way requirements, and service frequency. Passenger trains usually {{can be divided into}} two operations: intercity railway and intracity transit. Whereas as intercity railway involve higher speeds, longer routes, and lower frequency (usually scheduled), intracity transit involves lower speeds, shorter routes, and higher frequency (especially during peak hours).|$|E
25|$|Article 87 of the Basic Law and Article 11 of the Bill of Rights {{provides}} that anyone {{charged with a}} criminal offence shall {{have the right to}} be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law. This presumption is well established under the common law; the much-celebrated case of Woolmington v DPP laid down the basic criminal law principle that it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt subject to the defence of insanity and statutory exceptions. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant committed the criminal offence in question, the prosecution has not made out the case and the defendant is entitled to an acquittal.|$|E
25|$|The {{husband is}} financially {{responsible}} for the welfare and maintenance of his wife or wives and any children they produce, to include at a minimum, providing a home, food and clothing. In return, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> the wife to safeguard the husband's possessions and protect how wealth is spent. If the wife has wealth in her own capacity she is not obliged to spend it upon the husband or children, as she can own property and assets in her own right, so the husband has no right for her property and assets except by her will. A pre-marital agreement of the financial expectation from the husband is in the mahr, given by him to the wife for her exclusive use, which is included {{as part of his}} financial responsibility.|$|E
