The couple formally announced their separation on October 29, 1953, through MGM. Gardner filed for divorce in June 1954, {{at a time when}} she was dating matador Luis Miguel Dominguín, but the divorce was not settled until 1957. Sinatra continued to <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> for her, and they remained friends for life. He was still dealing with her finances in 1976.|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt was {{impressed}} by some models Saint-Gaudens had prepared for the cent showing a head of Liberty. [...] In early 1907, he wrote to Saint-Gaudens proposing that a Native American or Indian headdress {{be added to the}} obverse of the cent: [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> that on at least one coin we ought to have the Indian feather headdress. [...] It is distinctly American, and very picturesque. [...] Couldn't you have just such a head as you have now, but with the feather headdress?" [...] Numismatic historian Walter Breen described this as [...] "the absurd addition of a feathered warbonnet, such as neither Ms. Liberty nor any Native American woman would ever have worn". [...] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that the Indian Head eagle [...] "missed being a great coin because Roosevelt interfered with the choice of headdress (or no headdress) for Liberty".|$|E

2500|$|It's {{pretty hard}} {{to say on the}} one hand that we <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> about Pakistani and Indian nuclear testing {{and on the other hand}} the U.S. Senate won't ratify the ...treaty... The last thing the United States wants to see is a {{resumption}} of nuclear testing or the proliferation of nuclear weapons – and it is the last thing Australia wants to see. By refusing to ratify this treaty, the United States Senate has done a lot to undermine the arms control agenda that the international community, including Australia, has been working on.|$|E
2500|$|Opposition to Roe on {{the bench}} grew when President Reagan, who {{supported}} legislative restrictions on abortion, began making federal judicial appointments in 1981. Reagan denied {{that there was any}} litmus test: [...] "I have never given a litmus test to anyone that I have appointed to the bench…. I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> about those social issues, but I also place my confidence {{in the fact that the}} one thing that I do seek are judges that will interpret the law and not write the law.

[...] Shouse {{said that he had}} [...] "deep sympathy" [...] with the goals of the NRA, explaining, [...] "While I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> that the prohibition of child labor, the maintenance of a minimum wage and the limitation of the hours of work belong under our form of government {{in the realm of the}} affairs of the different states, yet I am entirely willing to agree that in the case of an overwhelming national emergency the Federal Government for a limited period should be permitted to assume jurisdiction of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pilot Guy Henderson's fiancée, Lorne Blyth, {{strongly}} endorsed {{two of the}} AAIB's recommendations {{when the}} accident report was published, saying, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> that everything possible {{should be done to}} ensure that future tragedies are prevented and therefore call on Transport Secretary Douglas Alexander to implement the recommendations from the AAIB report." [...] Blyth added, [...] "Had a second pilot been on the aircraft, or had the aircraft been equipped with a radio altimeter or other low-height warning device, the accident may not have happened." [...] Blyth also called for personal locator beacons for aircrew on such flights, which might have led to a quicker recovery of her fiancé's body. [...] "These are inexpensive but highly effective. Such equipment may not have saved Guy's life, but it almost certainly would have led to the recovery of his body in days rather than months," [...] said Blyth.|$|E
50|$|According to some commentators, {{what happens}} in {{practise}} in the VCLT regime is the third option.

This rarely happens, thus the reservation stands, whether it passed the legality test or not.|$|R

Meanwhile, producer RedOne described it as Gaga's [...] "freedom album" [...] as her manager, Troy Carter, felt her public image would begin to change after the release of Born This Way. A few months after the announcement, Gaga exclaimed that she had finished writing songs for the album: [...] "It came so quickly. I've been working on it for months, and I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> that it's finished right now. Some artists take years. I don't. I write music every day."

DiPietro, Wang and Snow all spoke confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides, despite the mixed reactions it received {{from the rest of the}} hockey world. Specifically, Wang stated, [...] "This is not a big deal. You have to have a commitment to who you're working with." [...] As speculation began as to whether other teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players, Atlanta Thrashers' general manager Don Waddell felt that, [...] "It's highly unlikely that you will see teams go beyond that.

[...] Speed commented “Natalie's always had strong feelings for Ricky. And now she's grown tired of being a mother to baby Jack and Barry!…family is everything to her, so she would have to <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> indeed about someone to put her marriage at risk. As for Ricky, I suppose Natalie's always held a torch for him. He was her first love who finished with her, so she's been left with a kind of 'what if?' feeling. When Natalie was younger she was easily seduced, {{and a little bit of}} that remains. She can be easily swayed if someone is nice." ...|$|E

According to biographer Marilyn H. Karrenbrock, [...] "McKinley's females do not simper; they do not betray their own nature to win a man's approval. But neither do they take love lightly or put their own desires before anything else. In McKinley's books, the romance, like the adventure, is based upon ideals of faithfulness, duty, and honor." ...|$|R

2500|$|Robb is {{more liberal}} on social issues. He {{voted for the}} Federal Assault Weapons Ban and against the {{execution}} of minors. He was opposed to {{a constitutional amendment to}} ban flag burning. In 1993, he supported Bill Clinton's proposal to adopt the don't ask, don't tell policy on homosexuals in the armed forces. Three years later, Robb was the only senator from a Southern state to oppose the Defense of Marriage Act. In stating his opposition to the bill, which his friends and supporters urged him to support, he said the following, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> that this legislation is wrong. Despite its name, the Defense of Marriage Act does not defend marriage against some imminent, crippling effect. Although we have made huge strides in the struggle against discrimination based on gender, race, and religion, it is more difficult to see beyond our differences regarding sexual orientation. The fact that our hearts don't speak in the same way is not cause or justification to discriminate." [...] Some have speculated that his position on gay rights, along with his positions on other hot-button issues like abortion, alienated the generally conservative voters of Virginia and contributed to his eventual defeat.|$|E

Issues #7-#12, while they tell a complete story, we're going to do a series of done-in-one stories with those issues. Each of those issues will be pretty good jumping-on points for anybody." [...] Issue #6 also featured the death of Annabelle Riggs, who Newsarama called [...] "one of Marvel's few prominent lesbian characters", which drew a strong reaction from fans. In response Bunn wrote, [...] "the fact that she was a lesbian didn’t even enter the equation for me, except that it was part of what made her who she was — just one part of many" [...] with Pyle adding, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> that her sacrifice was very true to everything we love about her. As to whether {{the fact that she is}} a lesbian should have kept us from telling a story in which she died… in this particular case, not having this specific character sacrifice herself would have made for a story in which we were less emotionally invested." ...|$|E
