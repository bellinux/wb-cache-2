40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} our preliminary work on understanding {{the impact of}} personality on the emotion induction in different social circumstances during the consumption of movies, {{for the purpose of}} the context-aware recommender system for movies. The {{purpose of this study is}} to answer two research questions: is there a difference in emotion induction when users are alone as opposed to when they are with company <b>during</b> <b>watching</b> the movie, and do different personality profiles influence the emotion induction when users are alone as opposed to when they are with company <b>during</b> <b>watching</b> the movie? We have used the (LDOS-CoMoDa) dataset which contains ratings and associated contextual information for the consumed movies, as well as Big Five personality profiles of the users. The results showed that there is an influence of social context on emotion induction, and that personality factors have to be taken into consideration since for the different groups of users, based on the personality factors, the emotion induction was influenced differently...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The primary visual cortex, Brodmann's area (BA 17), plays a {{vital role}} in basic {{survival}} mechanisms in humans. In most neuro-imaging studies in which the volunteers have to watch pictures or movies, the primary visual cortex is similarly activated independent of the content of the pictures or movies. However, in case the volunteers perform demanding non-visual tasks, the primary visual cortex becomes de-activated, although the amount of incoming visual sensory information is the same. Aim. Do low- and high-intensity erotic movies, compared to neutral movies, produce similar de-activation of the primary visual cortex? Methods. Brain activation/de-activation was studied by Positron Emission Tomography scanning of the brains of 12 healthy heterosexual premenopausal women, aged 1847, who watched neutral, low- and high-intensity erotic film segments. Main Outcome Measures. We measured differences in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the primary visual cortex <b>during</b> <b>watching</b> neutral, low-intensity erotic, and high-intensity erotic film segments. Results. Watching high-intensity erotic, but not low-intensity erotic movies, compared to neutral movies resulted in strong de-activation of the primary (BA 17) and adjoining parts of the secondary visual cortex. Conclusions. The strong de-activation <b>during</b> <b>watching</b> high-intensity erotic film might represent compensation for the increased blood supply in the brain regions involved in sexual arousal, also because high-intensity erotic movies do not require precise scanning of the visual field, because the impact is clear to the observer.

We calculate voxel-wise inter-subject correlation matrices across individual subject fMRI time-series and cluster them over the cerebral cortex. We address correlation matrix clustering problem and modify a standard K-means algorithm to cope better with spurious observations. We investigate suitability of the modified K-means with hierarchical clustering based postprocessing to correlation matrix clustering with several artificially generated data sets. We also present clustering of fMRI movie data. Preliminary results suggest that our methodology can be a valuable tool to investigate inter-subject variability in brain activity in different brain regions, such as prefrontal cortex. I...|$|E

40|$|This study {{experimentally}} {{tested the}} effects of exposure to television commercials using less thin models on mood, body focused anxiety and food intake, as compared to {{the effects of}} commercials using thin models. In a naturalistic setting, 110 young women were exposed to a neutral movie, interrupted by two commercial breaks. The commercial breaks contained real commercials using either less thin (n = 32) or thin models (n = 39), or neutral commercials (n = 39). <b>During</b> <b>watching</b> television, participants could freely eat snack food. Further, their mood and body focused anxiety was assessed. ANOVAs revealed no effects on body focused anxiety, but women reported a more negative mood and ate less after exposure to commercials using less thin models than after exposure to commercials using thin models. These results imply that using less thin models in commercials explicitly referring to the thin ideal does not make women feel better...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{indicate}} that people respond defensively to threatening health information, especially when the information challenges self-relevant goals. The authors investigated whether reduced acceptance of self-relevant health risk information is already visible in early attention allocation processes. In two experimental studies, participants were watching high- and low-threat health commercials, {{and at the same}} time had to pay attention to specific odd auditory stimuli in a sequence of frequent auditory stimuli (odd ball paradigm). The amount of attention allocation was measured by recording event-related brain potentials (i. e., P 300 ERPs) and reaction times. Smokers showed larger P 300 amplitudes in response to the auditory targets while watching high-threat instead of low-threat anti-smoking commercials. In contrast, non-smokers showed smaller P 300 amplitudes <b>during</b> <b>watching</b> high as opposed to low threat anti-smoking commercials. In conclusion, the findings provide further neuroscientific support for the hypothesis that threatening health information causes more avoidance responses among those for whom the health threat is self-relevant...|$|E

The platform uses 2 D laser range scanners for both self localization by scan matching and geometry acquisition and a panorama camera. 3 D models are acquired just by moving the platform through the scene to be captured. Thereby, geometry is acquired continuously and color images are taken in regular intervals. Two data processing flows are presented, a laser range scanner based flow and an omnidirectional stereo vision flow based on graph cuts. Both flows result in textured 3 D point clouds – various examples and a comparison are given in this paper...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} presenting users with shared multimedia annotation effectively using the de-gree of attention. Annotation systems, especially those for multimedia content, have been getting research at-tention. We assume the situation that users add annota-tions which are comments, figures, and sounds to the movie in asynchronous distance learning or asynchronous dis-tance discussion. In the case of shared annotations to a video, there are problems such as difficulty of view-ing vast quantity of annotations, and difficulty of skimming video. In order to solve these problems, a multimedia an-notation system which presents annotations to the users efficiently with the degree of attention is proposed. De-gree of attention is formed by users ’ interaction with movies such as referring, quoting, and responding. Our sys-tem also provides temporal distribution information of annotations with users to recognize when useful annota-tion is attached. Development of this system can be a step toward realization of more effective communication envi-ronment <b>during</b> <b>watching</b> movies...|$|E

40|$|Cinema is a {{promising}} naturalistic stimulus that enables, for instance, elicitation of robust emotions during functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). Inter-subject correlation (ISC) {{has been used as a}} model-free analysis method to map the highly complex hemodynamic responses that are evoked <b>during</b> <b>watching</b> a movie. Here, we extended the ISC analysis to frequency domain using wavelet analysis combined with non-parametric permutation methods for making voxel-wise statistical inferences about frequency-band specific ISC. We applied these novel analysis methods to a dataset collected in our previous study where 12 subjects watched an emotionally engaging movie “Crash” during fMRI scanning. Our results suggest that several regions within the frontal and temporal lobes show ISC predominantly at low frequency bands, whereas visual cortical areas exhibit ISC also at higher frequencies. It is possible that these findings relate to recent observations of a cortical hierarchy of temporal receptive windows, or that the types of events processed in temporal and prefrontal cortical areas (e. g., social interactions) occur over longer time periods than the stimulus features processed in the visual areas. Software tools to perform frequency-specific ISC analysis, together with a visualization application, are available as open source Matlab code...|$|E

Furthermore, the moderating role of maternal behaviors was investigated. The children (N = 121, aged between 8 and 12 years) were exposed to a neutral movie that was interrupted by two commercial breaks. These breaks contained commercials promoting either energy-dense foods, low energy {{versions of the same}} energy-dense foods (light food commercials), or neutral commercials aimed at adults. Snack food intake <b>during</b> <b>watching</b> television was measured. Children filled out questionnaires and were weighed and measured afterwards. Children who perceived maternal encouragement to be thin ate slightly more when exposed to energy-dense food commercials and especially when exposed to light food commercials than when exposed to neutral commercials. In contrast, children who perceived no maternal encouragement to be thin ate more when exposed to neutral commercials than when exposed to either energy-dense food commercials or light food commercials. These findings suggest that exposure to adult targeted light food cues produced disinhibition in children who experienced maternal encouragement to be thin, resulting in elevated snack food intake...|$|E
40|$|Objectives The {{ecological}} {{validity of}} video-vignettes design investigating patient-provider communication {{hinges on the}} engagement of analogue patients (APs) with the vignette. The present study aimed to compare engagement in two commonly utilized groups of APs, patients and disease-naïve individuals. Engagement was assessed by self-report and {{in the form of}} physiological arousal. Methods Cancer patients (N = 22) and disease-naïve individuals (N = 24) were recruited as APs. APs completed the Video Engagement Scale after watching a vignette of a oncologic bad news consultation. Electrodermal and cardiovascular activity were assessed continuously <b>during</b> <b>watching</b> the vignette, and cortisol levels were assessed in four saliva samples. Results Patients reported higher engagement with the vignette than disease-naïve individuals (t = 2. 46, p < 0. 05) and showed a larger blood pressure response (systolic: F = 5. 87, p < 0. 01 and diastolic: F = 4. 00, p < 0. 05). However, these differences disappeared after adjusting for age. No group differences were found on other psychophysiological parameters. Conclusions Our results suggest that patients and disease-naïve individuals are equally engaged when viewing video vignettes. When group differences were found, older age {{turned out to be a}} more prominent predictor of engagement.

40|$|Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) can {{exhibit a}} {{reduction}} of spontaneous facial expression, designated as “facial masking,” a symptom in which facial muscles become rigid. To improve clinical assessment of facial expressivity of PD, this work attempts to quantify the dynamic facial expressivity (facial activity) of PD by automatically recognizing facial action units (AUs) and estimating their intensity. Spontaneous facial expressivity was assessed by comparing 7 PD patients with 8 control participants. To voluntarily produce spontaneous facial expressions that resemble those typically triggered by emotions, six emotions (amusement, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise, and fear) were elicited using movie clips. During the movie clips, physiological signals (facial electromyography (EMG) and electrocardiogram (ECG)) and frontal face video {{of the participants were}} recorded. The participants were asked to report on their emotional states throughout the experiment. We first examined the effectiveness of the emotion manipulation by evaluating the participant’s self-reports. Disgust-induced emotions were significantly higher than the other emotions. Thus we focused on the analysis of the recorded data <b>during</b> <b>watching</b> disgust movie clips. The proposed facial expressivity assessment approach captured differences in facial expressivity between PD patients and controls. Also differences between PD patients with different progression of Parkinson’s disease have been observed...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the reliability of}} {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), an approach for mapping and quantifying reliably activated voxels was developed. First, a SPM 99 analysis was performed, and the resulting statistical maps were taken as the basis for subsequent analyses of reliability. Several approaches were demonstrated using 1). a voxel-wise intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); 2). an analysis of scatter plots, calculating the correlation of contrast t-values for pairs of activation maps; and 3). the ratio of overlapping volumes as suggested in the literature. The methods were applied to an fMRI study in which subjects were asked to vary their attentional effort <b>during</b> <b>watching</b> a flickering checkerboard pattern with varying letters in the center. The subjects had to ignore or attend to the presentation, or they had to detect a target letter within the checkerboard. The imaging data showed good reliability in terms of ICC for regions of visual processing, as well as for frontal areas, especially in the letter detection task. Furthermore, the size of reliable clusters depended on the presumed attentional effort of the subjects. Application of the method demonstrated that the activation due to visual stimulation could also be detected very consistently during a no-attend condition, but the reliability of the activations were best during the attended tasks...|$|E
