[...] "I don't ever know the rest, but that doesn't seem to matter. It's not the events that are important, it's the characters going through the event. Therefore, I make them as full and real as I can. This time around, I {{wanted to create a}} character who could handle everyone and everything." ...|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2008, Maia launched Duo Maia with her new partner Mey Chan. Unlike Ratu, Duo Maia was conceived as a vocal group and Maia was predominantly a vocalist. Meanwhile, Mulan signed with Republik Cinta Management under Ahmad Dhani. Mulan released a solo album entitled Makhluk Tuhan Paling Seksi (God's Sexiest Creature) in 2008 and changed her stage name to Mulan Jameela. Mambo, the Ratu's original vocalist, had already released a solo album, entitled Aku Tahu Rasanya (<b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>How</b> <b>It</b> Feels) in 2006. In 2009, [...] "Teman Tapi Mesra" [...] was bought by LadyLike, a Swedish girl band, and released in the European market as the English-language [...] "Dreaming of the Time".|$|E
500|$|Mambo {{had long}} nurtured {{a desire to}} become a solo singer. After she left Ratu, she was signed by Sony BMG [...] for six solo albums. Distancing herself from her former band, she found {{inspiration}} for her first album from a doll named she saw in a magazine. Considering herself as coquettish and pampered as the doll, she decided to base her album on the concept. Her debut solo album, Aku Tahu Rasanya (<b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>How</b> <b>It</b> Feels) and its singles [...] "Kasmaran" [...] ("Passion"), [...] "Aku Tahu Rasanya", and [...] "Dirimu Dirinya" [...] ("You and He"), a mix of pop and R, were successful. That year she recorded tracks for the compilation albums Portrait of Yovie Widianto and Best Female Idol.|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{explores the}} issue of place in {{relation}} not only to gender but also to class. As Saldívar has noted, [...] "Aside from the personal requirement of a gendered woman's space, Esperanza recognizes the collective requirements of the working poor and the homeless as well." [...] He refers to Esperanza's determination not to forget her working-class roots once she obtains her dream house, and to open her doors {{to those who are}} less fortunate. Esperanza says [...] "Passing bums will ask, Can I come in? I'll offer them the attic, ask them to stay, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is to be without a house." [...] According to Saldívar, this statement of Esperanza's alludes to [...] "the necessity for a decent living space" [...] that is fundamental to all people, despite the different oppressions they face.|$|E

500|$|The {{first season}} of Veronica Mars {{features}} a different [...] "case of the week" [...] each episode, and the season-long mystery of Lilly Kane's murder. In addition {{to developing a}} separate mystery for each episode, the writers also had to provide clues {{that would lead to}} the murder's resolution in the season finale. The murder mystery plot was planned {{from the beginning of the}} season and the killer's identity remained the same throughout production. Thomas said that at the beginning of the season, [...] "I know the broad strokes, I know who did it, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was done, I know the big arcs, but we're always filling in the details. Those are week to week. It's a week to week challenge in the writers room figuring out how much information we want to dole out to the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2011, Lucic had his {{customary}} day {{in possession of}} the Stanley Cup, which he spent in Vancouver. While it is traditional for players to host public celebrations with the trophy in their hometowns, Lucic chose to keep the day private, explaining that [...] "I grew up a Canucks fan. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is." [...] Following the Canucks' defeat in the Finals, fans had staged an hours-long riot in Downtown Vancouver. More personally, posters of Lucic at a local cultural community centre were defaced. Also, an appearance by Lucic at a Greek festival in Vancouver sparked a public brawl; The Vancouver Sun reported that Lucic did not throw any punches. While Lucic's day with the Cup was private, many of his functions were held in public venues, which were reportedly well received by passers-by. He brought the trophy to his hometown church, St. Archangel Michael Serbian Orthodox Church in Burnaby, for a gathering of approximately 350 people and on a harbour cruise with friends and family. He finished the day atop Grouse Mountain, the same place {{where he and his}} Vancouver Giants teammates took the Memorial Cup after their CHL victory in 2007. Months later, in February 2012, the church he brought the trophy to was vandalized.|$|E

2500|$|... "It {{takes me}} {{two years to}} [...] "document" [...] myself for a novel — two years of hard work. That is the trouble with the naturalistic novel — it {{requires}} so much documentary care. I never make, like Zola, {{a plan for a}} book. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> will begin and how it will end — that's all. When I finally get to writing it, it goes along rather fast — assez vite." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Would {{you be so}} kind as {{to explain}} it to me?' said Violet, in such serious {{distress}} that he answered with less trifling than usual, 'There is nothing to tell. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> would be if I asked leave, so I took it. That's all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> would be!

2500|$|Further {{evidence}} of John's political development {{is found in}} a letter of October 1842, to his friend John Martin, responding to Martin's sending him a copy of The Nation: [...] "I think The Nation will do very well"; and again in October, on the arrival of 20,000 additional troops in Ireland: [...] "How {{do you think the}} country will take all this?"

Gar'ner has undone me, and I shall go down into my grave a beggar, as his father has done already." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well, Mr Gresham. What I say {{is always}} nonsense, I know; {{you have always}} told me so.

[...] This {{assertion}} was rather a stretch {{on the part of}} Lady Arabella.|$|R
6000|$|... "When your ladyship {{was good}} enough to point out to me my boy's {{improper}} manner of speech to Lady Anna, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> must be.

6000|$|... --Ah, it's a scandalous shame for you, Stephen, {{said his}} mother, and you'll live to rue {{the day you}} set your foot in that place. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> has changed you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she agreed, [...] "that is true. Father was a carpenter, and I've {{always lived}} here; {{but we have}} people who are farmers, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is. I've often said, I {{never forget}} a face, but I never can {{remember}} names. Well, sir, you remember Sanford Hunt {{that went to}} the commercial college--" ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{raised his}} head as old Jolyon came in, and muttered: [...] "How are you, Jolyon? Haven't seen you for an age. You've been to Switzerland, they tell me.

6000|$|... 'Pooh--what {{shall we}} hear next?' Miss Aldclyffe {{surveyed}} Cytherea's face with leisurely criticism.
