Other parameters are the pocket’s aspect ratio, restrictor inlet conditions, and shaft velocity. The flow visualization procedure used a full-flow field tracking method, a Lagrangian method used to follow microsphere particles injected in the flow stream and, through them, visually reconstruct the flow pattern in the pocket. A highintensity pulsed YAG laser combined with an optical train of lenses was used to create a thin sheet of light that illuminates the particles contained in its plane. A long-distance microscope (LDM) coupled with a video camera digitally recorded the particles’ positions, thus creating instantaneous representative images of the flow structure. The experimental results presented herein are accompanied by a numerical simulation that uses CFD-ACE+, a commercial software package (ESI Group, Hunstville, Ala, 2006). The computational engine employed the full three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the steady-state flow in a hydrostatic pocket when an incompressible Newtonian fluid with constant properties was used.

The results suggest that when the tilting ratio is smaller than 0. 4 or the eccentricity ratio is smaller than 0. 1, the static and dynamic characteristics are relatively insensitive to the tilting and eccentricity ratios; however, for larger tilting or eccentricity ratios, the tilting and eccentric effects should be fully considered.

40|$|Lecturepg. 39 In {{view of the}} inflammability of LNG (liquefied natural gas), {{submerged}} type {{pumps are}} normally used to protect against leaks. The overhaul interval of an LNG pump, therefore, {{is subject to the}} life of its ball bearings, because LNG is an extremely low temperature, low viscosity and low boiling point liquid. The use of LNG to fulfill the extremely demanding functions of lubrication and cooling of ball bearings results in substantial reduction in the bearings? maximum load tolerance. The limits inherent in the ball bearings, consequently, will make it difficult to extend the life of the bearings beyond that currently achieved, if the bearing system itself depends on the use of conventional ball bearings. Since the service life of a ball bearing is not necessarily constant, there is a possibility of sudden break-down. Thus, new LNG pumps were developed using a form of bearing for which service lifetime is not primary importance, though it nevertheless has a long service life and high reliability, and is small and light. Details are given later. Two types of the static bearings were developed: a hydrostatic slide bearing and a hydrostatic guide bearing, incorporating a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>journal</b> bearing surrounding the ball bearing. The hydrostatic slide bearing supports the shaft by virtue of the film pressure of the LNG discharged from the pump itself. Therefore, the shaft with ball bearings in the usual way, the buffer effect of LNG in the hydrostatic guide section substantially reduces the radial load of the ball bearings. A <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>journal</b> bearing does not bear any of the thrust load. A structure has, therefore, been developed in which a disk-piston-type thrust balancing system can be used to enable self-balancing of the shaft thrust load, thereby reducing the thrust load to zero. The downstream side of the disk piston is designed to allow a variable clearance whereby, when it is at its maximum, the total flow area upward thrust force exceeds the downward thrust force. In this way, the two thrust forces always balance each other automatically. A high lift impeller was designed, the number of operational stages was reduced, and, radial diffusers were used to enable the use of shorter shafts. For the stage housing, a piston ring type sealing is used, a single layer cylinder casing method was developed that enables a multistep seal provided by the piston rings at each stage. This allowed the pump diameter to be reduced. The use of hydrostatic slide bearings (hydrostatic guide bearings), a thrust balancing mechanism, and the reduction of shaft length has enabled substantial extension to be made to the overhaul interval of pump. Pumps with hydrostatic slide bearings: 100, 000 hours or more. Pumps with hydrostatic guide bearings: 50, 000 hours or more. The use of hydrostatic slide bearings results in some reduction in the shaft bearing performance, due to wear of the face of the bearing. Measurement of the amount of wear, however, enables the remaining life of the bearing to be predicted, and this in turn facilitates cost reductions in terms of the failure diagnosis system employed. Furthermore, since there is little likelihood of sudden failure, maintenance schedules can be organized in a systematic way. The use of high lift impeller and single wall cylindrical radial diffuser has enabled the production of a compact, lighter pump unit, which is easy to disassemble and reassemble. This technology is applicable to pumps for other liquefied gas, for example, LPG, LEG (liquefied ethylene gas), etc...|$|E
40|$|Porous-ceramic {{hydrostatic}} bearings {{have been}} recently developed. These bearings have demonstrated an exceptional overall performance {{when compared with}} conventional technology bearings. However, despite all the benefits, porous-ceramic hydrostatic bearings {{have yet to find}} widespread acceptance due to the problems found in tailoring the bearings geometry and size to suit precision engineering applications, while producing porous-structures with consistent and reproducible permeability. Using a series of fine grades of alumina powders in combination with maize starch granules, a new method for the manufacture of porous-ceramic bearings has been developed, based on the starch consolidation technique. By employing this method, it has been demonstrated that is possible to manufacture bearings of different geometries and shapes, with consistent and reproducible properties. The new method also proved to be low cost and environmentally sound. The performance of the new journal bearings has been investigated in a highly instrumented test-rig, and a comparable performance to that of previous porous- ceramic journal research has been observed. In a direct performance comparison between a porous-ceramic <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>journal</b> bearing and a conventional hydrostatic bearing of the same size, the porous-ceramic bearing demonstrated a significant performance improvement in terms of stiffness, power consumption and thermal performance. In previous research, water lubrication proved to significantly improve the spindle thermal performance. However, water lubrication is feared to promote corrosion within the spindle components. In the present research, the effects of water lubrication in porous-ceramic bearing systems were investigated. As a result, it has been demonstrated that corrosion in typical machine-tool materials can be effectively controlled by using inhibitors and low cost surface coatings. On the other hand, it has been also demonstrated that undesirable foaming, air entrainment and microbial growth can potentially develop in water/inhibitors lubrication systems. In this sense, the use of low viscosity oils proved to offer a comparable performance. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} carry a load, a multi recess {{hydrostatic}} bearing supplied with a single pressure source requires compensation devices. These devices are also known as restricters and they allow the recess pressures to differ from each other. These devices, when properly selected and tuned, can deliver excellent bearing performance. However, these devices add {{to the complexity of}} the bearing and they are sensitive to manufacturing errors. These devices must often be tuned specifically for each bearing and are therefore expensive to install and maintain. Self-regulating or self-compensating bearings do not need any external devices to achieve load-carrying capability and they do not add to the total degrees of freedom of the system. However, in many cases the proposed designs require multiple precision manufacturing steps such as EDM and grinding in addition to precision shrink fit. In this work a self-compensating design, which eliminates all but one precision-manufacturing step, was manufactured and tested. Novel manufacturing methods for different sizes were introduced. The test results were compared with theoretical results and satisfactory agreement was achieved. The bearing sensitivity to manufacturing errors was analyzed computationally using statistical methods. These results were used to show that the introduced manufacturing methods are more cost effective than the applicable precision or semi precision manufacturing methods even when the performance variation is taken into account. When <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>journal</b> bearing is rotated hydrodynamic effects are introduced. Often, these effects are ignored by assuming them to be insignificant.
