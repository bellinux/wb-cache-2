5|$|<b>Frequency</b> <b>scaling</b> was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime {{of a program}} {{is equal to the}} number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average time it takes to execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.|$|E
5|$|However, power {{consumption}} P by a chip {{is given by}} the equation P = C × V 2 × F, where C is the capacitance being switched per clock cycle (proportional {{to the number of}} transistors whose inputs change), V is voltage, and F is the processor frequency (cycles per second). Increases in frequency increase the amount of power used in a processor. Increasing processor {{power consumption}} led ultimately to Intel's May 8, 2004 cancellation of its Tejas and Jayhawk processors, which is generally cited as the end of <b>frequency</b> <b>scaling</b> as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.|$|E

Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing <b>frequency</b> <b>scaling.</b> As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.|$|E
25|$|However, these {{techniques}} {{were found to}} be technically limiting and expensive. A more effective solution was to electronically shift the resonators’ frequencies to the oscillators’ output frequencies. This had the advantage that the resonators {{did not need to be}} individually trimmed; instead their frequencies could be measured and appropriate scaling coefficients recorded in the oscillator ICs. In addition, the resonators’ temperatures could be electronically measured, and the <b>frequency</b> <b>scaling</b> could be adjusted to compensate for the resonators’ frequency variation over temperature.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{the control}} and {{equalising}} of low frequency sound fields, a common and simple approach in the digital domain is to apply Finite Impulse Response filters. The FIR filters are quite easily implemented on digital signal processors and provide unconditioned stability. As for nearly all analogue control systems, these filters operate in a linear <b>frequency</b> <b>scale.</b> The human hearing mechanism however operates in an approximately logarithmic way with regard to frequency resolution. The Human Perception of Sound The human auditory system has been modelled in various ways with respect to frequency resolution and frequency dependent sound pressure sensitivity. There is some agreement that for many auditory phenomena a filter bank model seems appropriate. That is a new <b>frequency</b> <b>scale</b> can be formed.

40|$|The {{context of}} the thesis work is the {{improvement}} of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for use with digital libraries. First, commonly used multimedia file formats and codecs are surveyed {{with the objective of}} identifying those formats that preserve speech quality while keeping file sizes compact. The main contribution of the work is a new technique for speaker adaptation based on <b>frequency</b> <b>scale</b> modifications. The <b>frequency</b> <b>scale</b> is modified using a minimum mean square error matching of a spectral template for each speaker to a &quot;typical speaker &quot; spectral template. Each spectral template is computed from the average amplitude-normalized spectra of several seconds of the voiced portions of an utterance of a speaker. The advantages of the new technique include the relatively small amount of speech needed to form each spectral template, the text independence of the method, and the overall computational simplicity. Of several parameters investigated for implementing the spectral matching, two parameters, the low frequency limit and high frequency limit, were found to be the most effective. Generally the improvements due to the speaker normalization were small. However, it was determined that the normalization could compensate for the primary differences between male and female speakers. Furthermore, adjustment of the <b>frequency</b> <b>scale</b> parameters based on a neural network classifier, resulted in large improvements in vowel classification accuracy, thus indicating that <b>frequency</b> <b>scale</b> modifications can be used to obtain better ASR performance. ii © 2004 Wei Wang.
