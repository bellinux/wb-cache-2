40|$|Abstract Background The {{severity}} <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus {{is easily}} appreciated by its clinical appearance, however x-ray measurements are also frequently {{used to evaluate}} the condition, particularly if surgery is being considered. There have been few large studies that have assessed the validity of these x-ray observations across a wide spectrum of the deformity. In addition, no studies have specifically focused on older people where the progression of the disorder has largely ceased. Therefore, this study aimed to explore relationships between relevant x-ray observations with respect to hallux valgus severity in older people. Methods This study utilised 402 x-rays of 201 participants (74 men and 127 women) aged 65 to 94 years. All participants were graded using the Manchester Scale - a simple, validated system to grade the severity <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus - prior to radiographic assessment. A total <b>of</b> 19 <b>hallux</b> valgus-related x-ray observations were performed on each set of x-rays. These measurements were then correlated with the Manchester Scale scores. Results Strong, positive correlations were identified between the severity <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus and the hallux abductus angle, the proximal articular set angle, the sesamoid position and congruency of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. As hallux valgus severity increased, so did the frequency of radiographic osteoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and a round first metatarsal head. A strong linear relationship between increased relative length of the first metatarsal and increased severity <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus was also observed. Conclusions Strong associations are evident between the clinical appearance <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus and a number <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus-related x-ray observations indicative of structural deformity and joint degeneration. As it is unlikely that metatarsal length increases as a result <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus deformity, increased length of the first metatarsal relative to the second metatarsal may be a contributing factor to the development and/or progression <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus. </p...|$|R

30|$|In {{surgical}} treatment <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus, more than 150 different surgical procedures, {{many of them}} modifications of others, have been described. Surgical approaches include metatarsal and phalangeal osteotomies, arthrodesis, resection arthroplasties, and amputations. Silver [3] {{emphasized the importance of}} muscle imbalance, and in 1923, defined the “distal soft tissue procedure” (DSTP) as excision of the medial prominence, release of the adductor tendon and the lateral capsule, and plication of the medial capsule. In 1928, McBride [4] modified Silver’s method and proposed excision of the lateral sesamoid, release of the adductor tendon, and resuturing of the tendon {{to the head of the}} first metatarsal order to correct the metatarsal varus deformity. McBride revised and refined his approaches in 1935 [5] and 1954 [6].

40|$|Hallux varus was {{observed}} in 69 feet among patients from a rural Indian population. This included three types <b>of</b> congenital <b>hallux</b> varus. The congenital "primary " type was the commonest and {{was not associated with}} any other foot deformity. Among the acquired forms was idi-opathic <b>hallux</b> varus <b>of</b> middle age, which developed spon-taneously in unshod persons and progressed gradually. Hallux varus following chronic arthritis was part of a con-sistent pattern of foot deformities in which the first ray collapsed in a zig-zag manner in two planes. Although the development <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> varus is often due to intrinsic muscle imbalance, hallux varus secondary to chronic arthritis seems to occur as a result of both intrinsic and extrinsic muscle imbalance associated with midtarsal and subtalar arthritis. Muscular factors contribute to pro-gression of the deformity also. No anatomical basis for a racial prediliction for the deformity was noted.

40|$|Hallux valgus is {{a complex}} {{progressive}} foot deformity of uncertain aetiology. The disorder is characterised by a lateral deviation <b>of</b> the <b>hallux</b> at the first metatarsophalangeal joint; an angle > 15 is considered as clinical hallux valgus. A model that predicts first metatarsophalangeal joint angle and thus, hallux valgus is potentially very useful; enabling the clinician to identify individuals at risk of developing the disorder and to predict prognosis. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop such a model. The literature relating to hallux valgus identifies eight potential aetiological factors <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus. The scientific evidence presented in support of these suspected aetiological factors, and the theories <b>of</b> pathology <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus in association with these factors were critically evaluated by a review of the literature. Methods to evaluate the significance of these factors in hallux valgus were identified and appraised. These methods were applied to a large sample of genetically related individuals. The genetic and environmental influences affecting first metatarsophalangeal joint angle, pes planus, metatarsal formula, digital formula and first ray neutral position were explored through the statistical analysis of the data obtained from the sample. The results of analyses suggest that all of these variables are gender influenced, multifactorial traits. Further analysis of a subset of data generated a statistical model that relates the degree <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> deviation at the first metatarsophalangeal joint (and thus, the degree <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus) to clinically measurable predictor variables.

Hallux valgus was defined as > 15 ° angular deviation <b>of</b> the <b>hallux</b> {{with respect to the}} first metatarsal bone toward the lesser toes. Associations <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus with age, body mass index (BMI), race, education, pes planus, foot pain, and in women, history of high heel shoe use, were assessed using sex-specific Poisson regression with robust variance estimation for risk ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). ResultsHallux valgus was present in 58 % of women and 25 % of men. Higher BMI was inversely associated with presence <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus in women (P trend= 0. 001), with the strongest inverse association observed in those with BMI of 30. 0 or more compared to those with normal BMI (RR= 0. 7, 95 % CI: 0. 5, 0. 9). Women, who usually wore high-heeled shoes during ages 20 – 64 years compared to those who did not, had increased likelihood <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus (RR= 1. 2, 95 % CI: 1. 0, 1. 5).

For the purpose of contributing to development of a different perspective in the assessment <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus, this study was conducted with three objectives: a) to determine the position on the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the longitudinal axes of the first metatarsal and proximal phalanx (IP), b) to correlate the location of this point with hallux valgus deformity according to angular measurements and according to visual assessment of the severity carried out by three independent observers, and c) to assess whether this IP correlated with the radius of the first metatarsophalangeal arc circumference. Methods Measurements evaluated were intermetatarsal angle (IMA), hallux valgus angle (HVA), and proximal phalangeal articular angle (PPAA).

A clinical diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus was made in 150 children and confirmed using radiography in 122 cases. Pes planus was as common in children with hallux valgus as children with no hallux valgus. The biomechanical examination <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus children revealed that a plantarflexed first metatarsal was the only consistent biomechanical abnormality. The sagittal plane position of the first metatarsal did not however relate to the degree of metatarsus primus varus which is apparent in the unaffected feet of children with unilateral hallux valgus prior to the development <b>of</b> <b>hallux</b> valgus in both feet. The 122 children with hallux valgus were randomised into a non-treatment control group and a treatment group where Root foot orthoses were worn for three years.
