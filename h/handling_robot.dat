40|$|The role of {{compliant}} {{elements in}} a team of distributed object <b>handling</b> <b>robots</b> is discussed from the information, robot behavior, and cooperation protocol points of view. Also main benefits and some limitations on implementing compliant units {{in a group of}} distributed cooperative object <b>handling</b> <b>robots</b> are shown. It is proved that, any error in position of the stiff robots executing the Constrain-Move strategy [1] to transport an object will cause a movement lock in the system. Also, difficulties in stabilizing the robot-object contact in a team of distributed mobile object <b>handling</b> <b>robots</b> with stiff arms are discussed. It is verified that, specially designed compliant arms can be used to simplify the robot-object stabilization task and to remove the movement lock. Doing so, the system would be less sensor dependent and the robot control system is simplified. In addition, a distributed method is developed to help the compliant robots to solve the lock problem when there is a limitation on possible softness of the arms. Based on the discussions, a novel compliant arm is introduced and its main features are reviewed. Moreover, the role of this compliant mechanism in simplifying the distributed cooperation and coordination protocols, the robot information system, and the robot controller for executing th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This article {{introduces}} an instrumented {{glove and}} its application for robotic and human-assisted material handling manipulators. In its simplest form, worn by an operator, the sensory glove measures the force the wearer imposes on {{any part of}} the material <b>handling</b> <b>robot</b> or the object being maneuvered by the material <b>handling</b> <b>robot.</b> This measured force is then transmitted as radio frequency (RF) signals to the controller of the material <b>handling</b> <b>robot,</b> which in turn maneuvers the load so that the human operator only needs to exert {{a small portion of the}} force, leaving the actuator of the system to provide the remaining force required. Therefore, the actuators of the material handling system add exertion only in response to the operator's hand force on the material handling system, or on the object maneuvered by the robot. Our experimental glove has proven entirely effective in manipulating objects naturally similar to the way we manipulate objects manually without activating many switches and pushbuttons to command the device...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Facilities {{that provide}} a service for DNA {{sequencing}} typically support large numbers of users and experiment types. The cost of services is often reduced {{by the use of}} liquid <b>handling</b> <b>robots</b> but the efficiency of such facilities is hampered because the software for such robots does not usually integrate well with the systems that run the sequencing machines. Accordingly, {{there is a need for}} software systems capable of integrating different robotic systems and managing sample information for DNA sequencing services. In this paper, we describe an extension to the Protein Information Management System (PIMS) that is designed for DNA sequencing facilities. The new version of PIMS has a user-friendly web interface and integrates all aspects of the sequencing process, including sample submission, handling and tracking, together with capture and management of the data. Results The PIMS sequencing extension has been in production since July 2009 at the University of Leeds DNA Sequencing Facility. It has completely replaced manual data handling and simplified the tasks of data management and user communication. Samples from 45 groups have been processed with an average throughput of 10000 samples per month. The current version of the PIMS sequencing extension works with Applied Biosystems 3130 XL 96 -well plate sequencer and MWG 4204 or Aviso Theonyx liquid <b>handling</b> <b>robots,</b> but is readily adaptable for use with other combinations of robots. Conclusions PIMS has been extended to provide a user-friendly and integrated data management solution for DNA sequencing facilities that is accessed through a normal web browser and allows simultaneous access by multiple users as well as facility managers. The system integrates sequencing and liquid <b>handling</b> <b>robots,</b> manages the data flow, and provides remote access to the sequencing results.

40|$|AbstractTo {{increase}} the competition {{of the solar}} energy collection system, {{the size of the}} solar panel module during the manufacturing process is being increased continuously. As the size of the solar panel increases, the size of the robot to handle the panel increased also. The change in scale of the robot inevitably results in the amplification of the adverse effect of the flexure. The main source of the flexure in the large scale solar cell panel handling system is the long and thin fork fingers of the hand and the solar cell panel. In addition, the belt-driven actuator system used by most of the large scale panel <b>handling</b> <b>robot</b> is another significant source of the vibration. In this paper, the flexible multi body dynamic model of a large scale solar cell panel <b>handling</b> <b>robot,</b> which is being designed and constructed with the help of Kyung Hee University, is developed.
