25|$|In late 1965, Arthur Lilley {{and his son}} Martin Lilley {{purchased}} the assets of TVR to mitigate their personal losses of £2000 worth of TVR shares. TVR Engineering Ltd. was then formed on 30 November 1965, with Arthur as chairman. Arthur approached David Hives and offered him the position of General Manager and Senior Designs and <b>Development</b> <b>Engineer,</b> which David accepted. After two years of this arrangement, Hives asked Arthur Lilley to appoint his son Martin as managing director whilst Hives went to America to talk to Gerry Sagerman about the importation of TVRs. This ultimately resulted in Sagerman establishing TVR Cars of America.|$|E
25|$|During the 2006 British Motor Show in London, Aston Martin Racing {{revealed}} a near stock {{version of the}} V8 Vantage that would compete in the Nürburgring 24 Hours endurance race. The car, {{now known as the}} V8 Vantage N24, was driven by Aston Martin CEO Dr. Ulrich Bez, <b>development</b> <b>engineer</b> Chris Porrit, development driver Wolfgang Schuhbauer and German journalist Horst Graf von Saurma-Jeltsch in the 24‑hour race. The car finished 4th in class and 24th overall, before being driven home on public roads after the race. While essentially much like the existing coupé, the N24 had a front splitter and extended door sills for aerodynamic efficiency, a full roll cage, a racing fuel tank, and other modifications necessary to make the car race worthy. Other modifications include the removal of most of the interior, including all seats, replaced by a lone Recaro drivers seat.|$|E
500|$|Some Hammond organs have {{an audible}} pop or click when a key is pressed. Originally, key click was {{considered}} a design defect and Hammond worked to eliminate or at least reduce it with equalization filters. However, many performers liked the percussive effect, {{and it has been}} accepted as part of the classic sound. Hammond research and <b>development</b> <b>engineer</b> Alan Young said, [...] "the professionals who were playing popular music [...] that the attack was so prominent.

2500|$|Though being chassis no. 3, {{the vehicle}} YVB 153H is {{believed}} to have been the first off the production line as a vehicle in that colour was urgently required for marketing. The Velar name was derived from the Italian [...] "velare" [...] meaning to veil or to cover. Range Rover <b>development</b> <b>engineer</b> Geof Miller used the name as a decoy for registering pre-production Range Rovers. The Velar company was registered in London and produced 40 pre-production vehicles that were built between 1967 and 1970. Most of these Velar pre-production vehicles are accounted for and have survived into preservation.|$|E

2500|$|The Ohm Walsh {{loudspeakers}} use {{a unique}} driver designed by Lincoln Walsh, {{who had been}} a radar <b>development</b> <b>engineer</b> in WWII. He became interested in audio equipment design and his last project was a unique, one-way speaker using a single driver. The cone faced down into a sealed, airtight enclosure. Rather than move back-and-forth as conventional speakers do, the cone rippled and created sound in a manner known in RF electronics as a [...] "transmission line". The new speaker created a cylindrical sound field. Lincoln Walsh died before his speaker was released to the public. The Ohm Acoustics firm has produced several loudspeaker models using the Walsh driver design since then. [...] German Physiks, an audio equipment firm in Germany, also produces speakers using this approach.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{prototype}} (serial VX158), {{powered by}} four Rolls-Royce Avon RA.2 engines of [...] of thrust and piloted by Tom Brooke-Smith, had its maiden flight on 10 August 1951. By this time, {{in the light}} of the latest knowledge, and the fact that the Valiant project was now proceeding well and only six months behind the Sperrin the judgement of the Air Ministry was that an insurance project was now no longer needed, and a decision was taken to order the Vickers Valiant instead of the Sperrin and the Sperrin project was cancelled, although the Ministry of Supply determined that the Sperrin would serve as a research aircraft. Work on the two prototypes was continued, with the second prototype (VX161) flying on 12 August 1952 with Sqn Ldr [...] "Wally" [...] Runciman at the controls, accompanied by Flight Test <b>Development</b> <b>Engineer</b> Malcolm Wild. It was fitted with more powerful Avon RA.3s of [...] thrust.|$|E

40|$|When {{products}} are {{considered in the}} context of their overall life-cycle, there is an increased requirement for information on the various life-phases involved.

The resultant need to provide ecologically relevant product data both for <b>development</b> <b>engineers</b> and for disassembly planners {{in the context of}} the specific requirements concerned entails the necessity of using computer-aided information systems. This paper presents an information concept of this kind for supporting <b>development</b> <b>engineers</b> in implementing recyclable product designs, plus a procedure for planning and supporting manual disassembly.
