25|$|Before the Hatlestad Slide, Norway {{maintained}} a liberal policy {{when it came}} to housing construction on hills. The area of the afflicted housing units were therefore not surveyed for landslide risk before construction was commenced in the sixties, and the risk of landslides did not become known until later. After construction was finished, there were several incidents of rocks dislodging from the cliff and hitting the road. The rocks did not cause material damage or personal injury, and the municipality took no action besides setting up a warning sign by the road. Despite repeated complaints from Hatlestad's residents about this problem and the <b>general</b> <b>risk</b> of landslides, the municipality did not secure the area, stating that securing land against landslides {{is the responsibility of the}} property owner. However, an order given to the property owners to secure the hill were never responded to, and the case was never resolved.|$|E

25|$|The Applicant {{responded that}} the {{provisions}} used {{to ban the}} marches applied only to the safety and suitability of proposed venues rather than to a <b>general</b> <b>risk</b> of violence, and that the authorities on refusing an application for these reasons were obliged to suggest an alternative venue, which had not been done. He further contended that the Government's definition of morals was incorrect, as it referred only to majoritarian public opinion {{without regard to the}} concepts of pluralism or diversity. Furthermore, the proposed marches would not have been a threat to morals as they were concerned with human rights and civil liberties and would not have involved any sexually provocative content. He claimed the Government's references to public safety were unsubstantiated as they had not demonstrated an assessed risk of violence. He claimed finally that the sweeping nature of the ban was disproportionate and could not be justified {{on the grounds that it}} may have shocked or confused some parts of society (BÄ…czkowski v Poland).|$|E
25|$|Psychopathy, as {{measured}} with the PCL-R in institutional settings, shows in meta-analyses small to moderate effect sizes with institutional misbehavior, postrelease crime, or postrelease violent crime with similar effects {{for the three}} outcomes. Individual studies give similar results for adult offenders, forensic psychiatric samples, community samples, and youth. The PCL-R is poorer at predicting sexual re-offending. This small to moderate effect appears to be due largely to the scale items that assess impulsive behaviors and past criminal history, which are well-established but very <b>general</b> <b>risk</b> factors. The aspects of core personality often held to be distinctively psychopathic generally show little or no predictive link to crime by themselves. For example, Factor 1 of the PCL-R and Fearless dominance of the PPI-R have smaller or no relationship to crime, including violent crime. In contrast, Factor 2 and Impulsive antisociality of the PPI-R are associated more strongly with criminality. Factor 2 has a relationship of similar strength {{to that of the}} PCL-R as a whole. The antisocial facet of the PCL-R is still predictive of future violence after controlling for past criminal behavior which, together with results regarding the PPI-R which by design does not include past criminal behavior, suggests that impulsive behaviors is an independent risk factor. Thus, the concept of psychopathy may perform poorly when attempted {{to be used as a}} general theory of crime.|$|E
2500|$|Financial risk management, {{an element}} of {{corporate}} finance, is the practice of creating and protecting economic value in a firm by using financial instruments to manage exposure to risk, particularly credit risk and market risk.

2500|$|Depression Depression is well {{recognized}} in PD, having {{been identified as}} [...] "melancholia" [...] by James Parkinson in his original report of the disease in 1817. Estimated prevalence rates of depression vary widely according to the population sampled and methodology used, although depressive symptoms, irrespective of classically defined DSM criteria for depression, are present in 35% of patients There is an increased risk for any individual with depression {{to go on to}} develop Parkinson's disease at a later date. It is increasingly thought to be a consequence of the disease rather than an emotional reaction to disability, although [...] ample evidence shows that the relationship between depression and PD is bidirectional. <b>General</b> <b>risk</b> factors for depression are actually stronger markers for depression in PD patients than PD specific factors. Since Parkinson's affects many areas of the brain that control mood (specifically the frontal lobe as well as those areas that produce serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine), depression may result. [...] Depression {{is one of the most}} common neuropsychiatric conditions found in patients who have PD, and it is associated with more rapid progression of physical symptoms and a greater decline in cognitive skills. Depression in patients with PD was found to be more predictive of overall disability than was the motor disability from the PD. An interesting finding is that although a high rate of depression is seen in patients with PD, the incidence of suicide is lower in this group of patients. Many of the symptoms of PD may overlap with those of depression, making diagnosis a difficult issue.|$|E

40|$|A {{prospective}} audit {{was performed}} to assess how well patients were being consented for neurosurgery. Sixty patients with various neurosurgical conditions {{were included in the}} study. Audit was performed firstly by means of a questionnaire to examine the type of information given to patients, and their understanding of such information. Secondly, the patient's medical notes were reviewed to analyse any written evidence by the consenting doctor for the consenting procedure. 100 % of the patients felt that they had been informed satisfactorily about the nature of their condition {{and the nature of the}} operation. 92 % understood the specific risks of their proposed operation. However, only 25 % were informed about the <b>general</b> <b>risks</b> of surgery and anaesthesia. Only 33 % felt that they were informed fully about alternative treatment options. 97 % of the patients felt that they had reached an informed decision regarding surgery. 67 % of the case notes contained information on the nature and specific risks of the operation, while information on <b>general</b> <b>risks</b> of surgery and anaesthesia was documented in only 17 % of the case notes. 33 % of the case notes contained no information for the consenting procedure.

40|$|Purpose: There is no {{consensus}} {{on how best to}} communicate risk in breast cancer genetic counseling. We studied risk communication in completed series of counseling visits and assessed associations with counselees' postcounseling risk perception and satisfaction. Methods: Pre- and postcounseling questionnaires and videorecordings of all visits were available for 51 affected and unaffected women from families with no known BRCA 1 / 2 mutation, who fulfilled criteria for DNA testing. We developed a checklist for assessing risk communication and counselors' behaviors. Results: <b>General</b> <b>risks</b> were mainly communicated in initial visits, while counselee-specific risks were discussed mainly in concluding visits. The risks discussed most often were conveyed only numerically or qualitatively, and most were only stated positively or negatively. Counselors regularly helped counselees to understand the information, but seldom built on counselees' pre-existing perspective. Counselees' breast cancer risk perception after counseling was unrelated to whether this risk had been explicitly stated. The number of <b>general</b> <b>risks</b> discussed was negatively associated with counselees' satisfaction about counseling. Conclusion: Findings suggest that counselors' authority prevails over mutuality with individual counselees, in their communication about risks. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
