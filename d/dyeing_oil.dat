40|$|The {{effect of}} the oil/water {{interfacial}} tension on the voltage-controlled two-dimensional motion of an oil/water interface across a hydrophobic fluoropolymer insulator is investigated within an electrowetting-based optical element. The investigated element is a pixel that contains <b>dyed</b> <b>oil</b> and water. The concentration and type of dye used to color the oil phase has been varied. The resulting changes in the oil/water interfacial tension have been evaluated together with the dynamics and electro-optic characteristics of an open pixel. Experimental results are correlated with the measured static oil/water interfacial tension values. When decreasing the oil/water interfacial tension, the amplitude of the driving voltage required for obtaining a given oil displacement decreases and the switching curve becomes more steep. These effects can be accurately reproduced {{by means of an}} electro-optic model. Moreover, a reduction in oil/water interfacial tension strongly affects the speed of the moving oil/water interface. It accelerates the voltage driven oil contraction and decelerates the oil film reformation process that results upon removal of the voltage. The contact-line speed of the oil droplet depends linearly on the electrowetting driving force defined by the oil/water interfacial tension and the contact angle as a function of time. In case the horizontally expanding oil film meets a vertical hydrophilic wall an additional term has {{to be included in the}} electrowetting driving force to account for pinning effects. This term does not depend on the oil/water interfacial tension. Reported results provide useful directions when formulating <b>dyed</b> <b>oils</b> for electrowetting-based devices with moving oil/water interfaces...|$|R

Biodegradable polysaccharides are used as thickeners, carrying dyestuffs, chemicals, and other printing assistants to textile substrates during the printing process. Prolonged contact between the body and the textile is responsible for microbial infections, which has contributed to the use of oxidizing agents, halogens, and metal-based complexes, for example, to prevent microbial growth. To minimize the environmental risks associated with those synthetic agents, researchers are currently looking for natural dyes with antimicrobial activities that adhere to the textile substrates. Besides the growing market demand for textiles that offer comfort, other properties are gaining prominence such as deodorizing, insect-repellent, flame retardant, and UV protective properties [4].|$|R

Whereas {{previous studies have}} established that esterified cholesterol deposits intra- and extracellularly, less is known concerning the distribution of lesion unesterified cholesterol. The objective {{of this study was}} to establish the location and in what structures unesterified cholesterol accumulates in lesions. The fluorescent probe filipin has been used to detect unesterified cholesterol. In addition, the lipid-soluble <b>dye</b> <b>oil</b> red O (which does not stain unesterified cholesterol) was used to stain hydrophobic lipids, including esterified cholesterol. Filipin staining occurred in association with three extracellular structures: spherical particles, elongated crystals, and granular or amorphous calcium deposits. These structures were not stained by oil red O. Filipin-stained particles sometimes accumulated within cells, which did not contain any oil-red-O-stained lipid. Interestingly, extracellular filipin-stained particles occurred in loci separate from extracellular oil-red-O-stained particles. The results of this study suggest that accumulation of unesterified and esterified cholesterol occurs within many diverse structures in atherosclerotic lesions.

Material and methods.  In this study we’ve evaluated {{the effect of}} γ-lactone sesquiterpene aсhillin and gemfibrozil (comparator drug) on the lipid content in the hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cell which were incubated with a fat emulsion lipofundin by fluorescent method with vital dye Nile Redand staining the cells with the <b>dye</b> <b>Oil</b> Red O. The cell viability was investigated using the MTT-test and staining with Trypan blue. Results.   Cultivation cells HTC with aсhillin and gemfibrozilat concentrations ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5 mM and from 0. 25 mM to 0. 5 mM, respectively, resulted in dose-dependent decrease of the fluorescence’s intensity Nile Red. It reflects a decrease in lipid content in the cells. At these concentrations the drugs didn’t have cytotoxic effect and the cell viability didn’t change compared to the control culture. An experimental hyperlipidemia in the hepatoma culture cells was induced by adding to the incubation medium a fat emulsion lipofundin at a final concentration 0. 05 %. The intensity of fluorescence Nile Red in the cells was increased 4 fold (p  <  0. 05). This result suggests the significant accumulation of lipids in the cell’s cytosol and confirmed by microscopy after staining neutral lipids with the <b>dye</b> <b>Oil</b> Red O. Under these conditions aсhillin and gemfibrozil reduced lipid content in cells and hadthe effect at concentrations of 0. 5 mM and 0. 25 mM respectively. Conclusion.   In the lipofundin-mediated model of hyperlipidemia the sesquiterpene lactone aсhillin prevents the lipid accumulation in cells. It confirms by decrease of fluorescence Nile Red and reduction lipid drops which were stained with Oil Red O in cytosol. To establish the molecular targets of aсhillin’saction on lipid metabolism in cell culture HTC we need to investigate a gene expression of key enzymes of lipid metabolism. </div...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Secondary {{migration}} {{is defined as}} the movement of hydrocarbons through relatively permeable rocks from source to trap: a two-phase flow within a porous medium. Depending on the geometry and capillary pressure distributions of carrier beds, secondary migration has both vertical and lateral components. The present paper focuses on that part of the migration where the movement is mainly vertical. Its objective is to propose a description of the dynamics governing the vertical part of secondary migration based on the main physical aspects of two-phase flow in a homogeneous porous medium. The study is illustrated by laboratory observations performed in a vertical, 2 -D Hele-Shaw cell filled with a transparent porous medium where the flow of <b>dyed</b> <b>oil</b> invading a wetting fluid is visually observed. These observations help us to understand the effect of buoyant, capillary and viscous forces on the resulting flow, the relative importance of which is characterized by non-dimensional numbers. Extrapolating these observations to natural media, it is proposed that vertical secondary migration can be described as a percolation of disconnected and vertically-elongated stringers. These stringers do not move continuously but as a succession of snap-off and re-feeding events which result in a jerky upward movement. Using parameters characterizing the physical properties of the fluid and of the porous medium, th...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} study {{into the}} nature of the separated flows on the suction side of modem transonic fan airfoils at high incidence is described in the paper. Suction surface. flow separation is an important flow characteristic that may significantly contribute to stall flutter in transonic fans. Flutter in axial turbomachines is a highly undesirable and dangerous self-excited mode of blade oscillations that can result in high cycle fatigue blade failure. The study basically focused on two visualization techniques: surface flow visualization using <b>dye</b> <b>oils,</b> and schlieren (and shadowgraph) flow visualization. The following key observations were made during the study. For subsonic inlet flow, the flow on the suction side of the blade is separated over {{a large portion of the}} blade, and the separated area increases with increasing inlet Mach number. For the supersonic inlet flow condition, the flow is attached from the leading edge up to the point where a bow shock from the upper neighboring blade hits the blade surface. Low cascade solidity, for the subsonic inlet flow, results in an increased area of separated flow. For supersonic flow conditions, a low solidity results in an improvement in flow over the suction surface. Finally, computational results modeling the transonic cascade flowfield illustrate our ability to simulate these flows numerically...|$|R

The results showed that pretreatment of blanching with calcium ions and coating with guar gum and sorbitol could significantly reduce the structural oil (STO) and penetrated surface oil (PSO) of French fries and have no negative effects on its texture and also effectively control the final moisture content (p < 0. 05). Compared with control or samples coated with guar gum (blanching with or without calcium ions), the total oil (TO) of French fries with guar gum and sorbitol reduced by 50. 8 %, 33. 1 % and 30. 6 %, respectively. CLSM photographs confirmed that STO significantly reduced after coating with guar gum and sorbitol, followed by PSO.
