5|$|Many of the scutes are {{strengthened}} by bony plates known as osteoderms, {{which are the}} same size and shape as the superficial scales but grow beneath them. They are most numerous on the back and neck of the animal and may form a protective armour. They often have prominent, lumpy ridges and are covered in hard-wearing beta-keratin. Most of the skin on the head is fused to the skull. The skin on the neck and flanks is loose, while that on the abdomen and underside of the tail is sheathed in large, flat square scutes arranged <b>in</b> <b>neat</b> rows. The scutes contain blood vessels and may act to absorb or radiate heat during thermoregulation. Research also suggests that alkaline ions released into the blood from the calcium and magnesium in these dermal bones act as a buffer during prolonged submersion when increasing levels of carbon dioxide would otherwise cause acidosis.|$|E

25|$|The {{blood of}} the {{innocent}} victims of last Friday's outrage—and {{of the victims of}} similar outrages in the North and in England—is on the hands of every man who has fired a gun or discharged a bomb in furtherance of the present campaign of violence in these islands—just as plainly as it is on the hands of those who parked the cars and set the charges last Friday. In our times, violence cannot be contained <b>in</b> <b>neat</b> compartments and justified in one case but not in another.|$|E
25|$|Japanese and Korean Mahjong {{have some}} special rules. A player cannot win by a discard if that player had already {{discarded}} that piece, where players' discards are kept <b>in</b> <b>neat</b> rows {{in front of}} them. Players may declare ready, meaning that they need one tile to win, cannot change their hand and win extra points if they win. Some rules may replace some of the number 5 tiles with red tiles, as they can earn more points. Korean Mahjong does not allow melded (stolen) chows.|$|E
25|$|Monospaced typefaces {{function}} {{better for}} some purposes because their glyphs line up <b>in</b> <b>neat,</b> regular columns. No glyph is given any {{more weight than}} another. Most manually operated typewriters use monospaced fonts. So do text-only computer displays and third- and fourth-generation game console graphics processors, which treat the screen as a uniform grid of character cells. Most computer programs which have a text-based interface (terminal emulators, for example) use only monospaced fonts (or add additional spacing to proportional fonts to fit them in monospaced cells) in their configuration. Monospaced fonts are commonly used by computer programmers for displaying and editing source code so that certain characters (for example parentheses used to group arithmetic expressions) are easy to see. Monospaced fonts may also {{make it easier to}} perform optical character recognition.|$|E

25|$|In a pit {{excavated}} next {{to these}} four men were placed {{the bodies of}} {{a large group of}} young women. This mass grave contained the remains of 53 females ranging in age between 15–30 years of age, arranged in two layers separated by matting. The young women show evidence of having been strangled before being arranged <b>in</b> <b>neat</b> rows in the pit. Analysis of bones and dental traits of these women have led archaeologists to believe these individuals were not from the same social class and ethnic group as other individuals interred in the mound. Non-metric dental traits have suggested that these individuals were not from the Cahokia area and were possibly immigrants new to the area. Analysis of specific carbon isotope and nitrogen isotope ratios left by maize consumption in the bones and cartilage of the women as well as pathologies indicative of poor health and nutritional stress; have led researchers to also conclude they were of a lower social status than elite burials in the mound, consuming more maize and less animal protein than elite individuals.|$|E
25|$|The first attacks {{began at}} 03:00 on 22 June. The Soviets {{had been caught}} by surprise, their {{aircraft}} bunched together <b>in</b> <b>neat</b> rows which were vulnerable. The results were devastating. At Pinsk aerodrome 39 SBAP of 10 SAD lost 43 SBs and five Pe-2s on the ground after attacks by KG 3, which lost one bomber. Further to the west, 33 IAP/10 SAD lost 46 I-53 and I-16s to fighter-bombers of JG 51. Messerschmitt Bf 110s of SKG 210 destroyed 50 aircraft at Korbin airfield, near the headquarters of 10 SAD and the Soviet Fourth Army. The airfield based the 74 ShAP, which lost 47 I-15s, 5 I-153s and 8 IL-2 aircraft on 22 June. Worse was still to come. Slightly later, KG 54 attacked airfields in the area, and its 80 Ju 88s destroyed 100 Soviet aircraft. However, the Luftwaffe and its allies were far from alone in the skies. The VVS flew 6,000 sorties {{in comparison to the}} German 2,272 sorties and VVS ZOVO put 1,900 aircraft into the air. They put up bitter resistance in the air scoring a few successes.|$|E
25|$|Established in 1870, the Golden Gate Park Nursery has {{remained}} {{one of the}} few places in the park restricted to the public. This nursery began with donated plants from around the world and expanded over the years with the care of past Golden Gate Park gardeners. The nursery has moved around the park thrice; first to where McLaren Lodge stands today, then to where Kezar Stadium is currently located and finally to its current location of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. This Nursery houses over 800 species of plants, some of which are exclusive to the nursery, and are sold to the public on the third Saturday of the month. Every week over 3,000 plants are dispersed within the city and park. When the park requires repairing or is in need of empty beds filled, the Nursery provides its wide variety of plants to fill in the blank spaces. Indoors, the plants are set up <b>in</b> <b>neat</b> rows and beds, showing off the nursery’s green diversity for the buyers picking. The Golden Gate Park Nursery is one of the city’s main green providers and is greatly responsible for the city’s plant life.|$|E

Its exact wording is unknown, because Cooper later reclaimed it, but Schaffner recalled that it indicated {{he had a}} bomb in his briefcase, and directed her to sit beside him. Schaffner did as requested, then quietly asked to see the bomb. Cooper cracked open his briefcase long {{enough for her to}} glimpse eight red cylinders ("four on top of four") attached to wires coated with red insulation, and a large cylindrical battery. After closing the briefcase, he dictated his demands: $200,000 in [...] "negotiable American currency"; four parachutes (two primary and two reserve); and a fuel truck standing by in Seattle to refuel the aircraft upon arrival. Schaffner conveyed Cooper's instructions to the pilots in the cockpit: when she returned, he was wearing dark sunglasses.|$|E
500|$|The asylum {{complex is}} an example of the E-plan lunatic asylums based on the model 1850s asylum in Colney Hatch, England, which itself was based on the 1830 design of Hanwell Asylum in London. [...] Kew was also {{considered}} a barracks style asylum due to its perceived resemblance to stockades or gaols. [...] The buildings are constructed from oversize bricks, made from local clay which was quarried on-site. The bricks were then rendered with cement. [...] The central administration block is three storied with a mansard roof and cupola. [...] Two storeyed ward wings extend to each side, one for each sex. [...] Each wing has a four storey, mansard-roofed tower, which contained water tanks. [...] The ward wings were surrounded by courtyards lined with iron columned verandas, many of which were retained when the complex was redeveloped. [...] Internally, the dormitories had [...] ceilings and brightly coloured walls with the beds aligned <b>in</b> <b>neat</b> rows. [...] The floors were of timber, principally so they could be scrubbed.|$|E
500|$|Other {{drawings}} of interest include numerous studies generally {{referred to as}} [...] "caricatures" [...] because, although exaggerated, {{they appear to be}} based upon observation of live models. Vasari relates that if Leonardo saw a person with an interesting face he would follow them around all day observing them. There are numerous studies of beautiful young men, often associated with Salai, with the rare and much admired facial feature, the so-called [...] "Grecian profile". These faces are often contrasted with that of a warrior. Salai is often depicted in fancy-dress costume. Leonardo is known to have designed sets for pageants with which these may be associated. Other, often meticulous, drawings show studies of drapery. A marked development in Leonardo's ability to draw drapery occurred in his early works. Another often-reproduced drawing is a macabre sketch that was done by Leonardo in Florence in 1479 showing the body of Bernardo Baroncelli, hanged in connection with the murder of Giuliano, brother of Lorenzo de' Medici, in the Pazzi conspiracy. With dispassionate integrity Leonardo has registered <b>in</b> <b>neat</b> mirror writing the colours of the robes that Baroncelli was wearing when he died.|$|E

2500|$|In 1916, owner R. M. Power {{sold the}} Majestic to Frank W. Fischer of Chicago. Facing {{competition}} from Madison's newer movie houses, Fischer renovated the theater by switching from coal to oil heating, installing a new ventilation system and moving the projectionist booth {{to the top}} of the balcony. He also added new lighting effects and an electric Bartolo organ for $7000, later replacing it a year later with a much larger model for a reported $46,000. He also employed [...] "mulatto girls <b>in</b> <b>neat</b> costumes" [...] as ushers. He remodeled the theater yet again in 1923.

Safeway is an early example, and the victory of eight children in a suit against their Lafayette, Louisiana school was a landmark decision in favor of Rastafari rights. More recently, in 2009, a group of Rastafari settled a federal lawsuit with the Grand Central Partnership in New York City, allowing them to wear their locks <b>in</b> <b>neat</b> ponytails, rather than be forced to [...] "painfully tuck in their long hair" [...] in their uniform caps.|$|E
