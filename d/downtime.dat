40|$|<b>Downtimes</b> in a {{manufacturing}} cell, a production line or an individual machine {{are characterized by}} a complex statistical behavior that their frequency and duration display. The work reported here concerns likenesses and differences between various statistical distributions that apply to functional times (TBF) and <b>downtimes</b> (DT) in connection with different discrete manufacturing processes. The TBF and DT are viewed as varying over the whole production time for the batch. A method is presented for analyzing the dynamic behavior involved in terms of costs. An important element in this method is the statistical analysis of <b>downtimes,</b> making use of both empirical and theoretical distribution functions that apply to functioning times and <b>downtimes</b> of specific types. For demonstrating how the method is employed, use is made of real data obtained from the Swedish company Alfa Laval...|$|R

5|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCoE) can be calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by {{the total amount of}} electricity shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant and the interest payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for <b>downtime</b> due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a figure of merit for the {{cost of electricity}}.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to cause significant disruption to oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico. Several hundred active wells went out of service, and drilling {{came to a halt}} for a few days during and after the cyclone's passage. One of Humble company's tenders saw three-quarters of its mooring chains compromised, which swung it around into an adjacent oil platform, causing $200,000 in damage (1956USD). The cost to <b>downtime</b> in production was greater than the damage Flossy created to the oil rigs. There was no loss of life. Due to the impact of Flossy on oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico, the American Petroleum Institute formed a committee called Fundamental Research on Weather Forecasting. Their goal was to use mathematical models and historic data to better predict hurricane formation and path. Studies went on into 1962, but no reliable forecast mechanism was found.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} {{paper was}} to determine the productivity of a John Deere 1070 D harvester in deciduous coppices of Quercus petraea and Fagus sylvatica, in thinnings over 50 years of age. The research area was located in Tribeč mountain ridge, western Slovakia. The terrain incline did not exceed 20 %. The productivity of the harvester in oak stands was 9. 97 m 3. h− 1 without <b>downtimes</b> (breaks, failures, etc.). Performance with breaks was 4. 98 m 3. PMH− 1 (productive machine hour). The productivity of the harvester was influenced by a large portion of passes of the harvester, which constituted 23. 47 % of the time of the operating cycle. The large number of passes was caused {{by the fact that the}} operator did not respect the technologic process and a high portion of tree extraction (8. 45 %). Furthermore the productivity was decreased by frequent failures of the machine and <b>downtimes,</b> which could be prevented by proper and regular maintenance. The productivity in beech stands was 6. 36 m 3. h− 1 without <b>downtimes</b> and 5. 35 m 3. PMH− 1 with <b>downtimes</b> included. Lower productivity was caused by the numerous and thick branches and frequent presence of trees with multiple tree tops, ergo unsuitable structure of the stand. Absence of a worker with a chainsaw was considered to be a disadvantage, because this worker is often a necessity when harvesters operate in deciduous stands...|$|R

5|$|GM halted {{production}} for about one {{month at the}} Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant by mid June 2011 to complete some upgrades, including the installation of new tooling, equipment and overhead conveyor systems throughout the facility. These upgrades allowed GM to triple the rate of Volt production and prepared the plant for 2012 Volt and Ampera production. After the plant retooling, the production rate reached 150 units per day {{four days a week}} by August 2011. The Volt plant was also down during January 2012 in preparation for building the California lower-emission version. A four-week shutdown due to slow sales took place between March and April 2012. GM said it had around 3,600 Volts in inventory and needed to reduce dealer inventories as production is expected to meet market demand. GM also extended the traditional two-week summer vacation by an extra week at the Hamtramck plant. GM closed its Detroit-Hamtramck plant from September 17 until October 15, 2012, affecting roughly 1,500 workers on <b>downtime</b> while the plant was retooled to assemble the all-new 2014 Chevrolet Impala alongside the 2013 Volt. This was the second time in 2012 that GM has halted Volt production.|$|E
5|$|Prone to <b>downtime</b> due to Keenan's other musical commitments, {{among other}} things, the band has {{featured}} {{a variety of}} musicians in the other roles throughout its alternating periods of activity and inactivity. The original incarnation of the band included Paz Lenchantin on bass, Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar, and Josh Freese on drums; though Primus drummer Tim Alexander had briefly stood in as a drummer prior to Freese in the band's initial live shows prior to releasing any material. Band collaborator and producer Danny Lohner and Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White were also members {{for a short period}} in the early 2000s. The band's current lineup features former Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, bassist Matt McJunkins, and drummer Jeff Friedl, the latter two also being contributors to the related Puscifer and Ashes Divide projects. Despite the varied cast and numerous lineup changes, the stylistic content of the songs has remained consistent with Howerdel as music composer, and Keenan penning the lyrics and vocal melodies. The band's studio albums have been generally well received critically and commercially, with their three studio albums selling 4 million copies collectively as of 2005.|$|E
5|$|Activity began {{slowing down}} for the band by late 2000, with Keenan {{returning}} to Tool to finish the recording {{of what would be}} their next album, Lateralus. Keenan returned to A Perfect Circle to tour from January to March 2001, until returning to Tool again for the rest of 2001 to release and tour in support of Lateralus. Initial plans were for Howerdel to collaborate long-distance on writing new A Perfect Circle material with Keenan while he toured with Tool, by sending ideas back and forth to one another, though Keenan found it too difficult to balance both, eventually lessening his role while he focused on Tool. Efforts continued through mid-2002, with Howerdel primarily focusing on writing new material while sporadically working with Van Leeuwen, Lenchantin, and Freese. By June 2002, Van Leeuwen estimated that about 80% of the instrumental material was completed while they waited for Keenan's return. However, lineup changes and disagreements on the album's direction would lead to the album not being released for over a year. Both Lenchantin and VanLeeuwen had both been working on solo material during the band's <b>downtime,</b> and then moved on to join other bands. Lenchantin would leave to join Billy Corgan's new start-up band Zwan in April 2002, while Van Leeuwen began touring Queens of the Stone Age shortly after. Ex-Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White, formerly known as Twiggy Ramirez, replaced Lenchantin on bass in January 2003. Shortly after, VanLeeuwen permanently left the band, and long-time band collaborator Danny Lohner filled in temporarily as the second guitarist for wrapping up the album.|$|E
