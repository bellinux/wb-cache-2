5|$|For the {{hand-held}} camera footage, Soderbergh used Panavision Millennium XLs {{that were}} smaller and lighter than previous cameras and {{allowed him to}} move freely. In order to tell the three stories apart, he adopted a distinctive look for each. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel. For Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film, overexposing it for a warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feel. Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly. He wanted to have different looks for each story because the audience had {{to keep track of}} many characters and absorb a lot of information and he did not want them to have to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> story they were watching.|$|E

25|$|In general, fMRI studies acquire both many {{functional}} {{images with}} fMRI and a structural image with MRI. The structural image is usually {{of a higher}} resolution and depends on a different signal, the T1 magnetic field decay after excitation. To demarcate regions {{of interest in the}} functional image, one needs to align it with the structural one. Even when whole-brain analysis is done, to interpret the final results, that is to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> regions the active voxels fall in, one has to align the functional image to the structural one. This is done with a coregistration algorithm that works similar to the motion-correction one, except that here the resolutions are different, and the intensity values cannot be directly compared since the generating signal is different.|$|E

25|$|In California, the {{influence}} of Italian immigrants in {{the early history of}} the state's wine industry introduced Nebbiolo to the United States in the 19th century. As Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot increased in popularity in the 20th century, Nebbiolo (as well as other Italian grape varieties) steadily decreased in plantings. Today there are scattered plantings of Nebbiolo throughout the state with the majority located in the jug wine producing region of the Central Valley. As California wine producers aim for producing higher quality wines, there has been difficulties in locating ideally suited sites for Nebbiolo and the progress in producing world class California Nebbiolo is considerably behind that of other Italian varietals like Sangiovese, Primitivo and even Barbera and Dolcetto. In Washington State, Nebbiolo was first planted in the Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley AVA in 1985 with the first varietal release in 1987. As in California, Washington producers are still trying to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> sites are best suited to grow Nebbiolo. While the wine is mainly produced as a varietal, some producers make blends with Dolcetto and Syrah added in.|$|E

500|$|... "The Crepes of Wrath" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The Simpsons for which George Meyer was {{credited}} as a writer, and he wrote it together with Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. The episode {{was inspired by the}} French movie Manon of the Spring. The writers were trying to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> country the foreign exchange student should come from when they came up with Albania. They had not seen many uses of the country on television and decided to make the episode a tribute to actor John Belushi, who has Albanian roots. The writers did not know much about the country and could not think of a good name for the boy so they gave him the surname Hoxha after the former leader of Albania, Enver Hoxha. They used real Albanian in the scene where Adil says goodbye to his family, and they tried to get the actual language right at Sam Simon's instigation. They also used real French in the scenes of Bart in France. The writers did some research on a certain airport in France for the shots of Bart at the airport in Paris. Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes Skinner, made her first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode, although her voice was a bit different from what the viewers are used to in the later episodes of the show.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the reviews}} were several {{negative}} ones, which compared the series negatively to the original. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe felt that like the original, 90210 was [...] "pretty bad". Gilbert {{said that the}} episode [...] "seemed to take forever to set up some remarkably bland plotlines", which he found had been executed with more finesse by other teen soaps. The reviewer criticized the writers for their [...] "unimaginative material", exemplified by the risqué anal sex scene which he opined {{would no longer be}} considered outrageous for a series targeted at teenagers. Gilbert claimed that the characters lacked depth and distinction, especially Naomi, whom he compared negatively to Gossip Girls Blair Waldorf. By contrast, Tom Gliatto of People magazine gave Naomi Clark a favorable review, but stated that he felt the cast as a whole had yet to gel. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the pilot as [...] "corny but trying to be hip, crammed with subplots until the producers <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> ones the audience responds to." [...] Tucker praised Walters acting as a [...] "slashing panache that no one else on screen approaches", and found the only time he laughed with pleasure throughout the pilot was when her character exclaimed, [...] "I'm gonna call Dan Tana's for some takeout!". Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel described the pilot as [...] "a blah variation on Beverly Hills, 90210", and being too [...] "extravagant and less believable". Boedeker expressed disappointment in the series, and predicted that it would be canceled within a year.|$|E
500|$|Following Russell's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} [...] "The S'more, the Merrier" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were {{required}} to walk back and forth transferring cups of hot chocolate to a jar {{on the opposite side}} of the backyard. The first HouseGuest to fill up their jar and claim the ball inside would be the winner of the competition. Kevin was the winner. Despite making a deal with him the previous week, Kevin and Natalie later made a plan to backdoor Jeff as they saw him as their biggest threat. Though this was his plan, Kevin and Natalie also debated taking out Michele, and thus feared that Jeff could win the Power of Veto and save Jordan if she were to be nominated; should Jeff use the Power of Veto on Jordan, it would force Kevin to nominate Natalie for eviction. On Day 55, Kevin chose to nominate Jeff and Michele for eviction. Later that day, Kevin discovered a secret room in the Head of Household bedroom known as Pandora's Box; upon entering the room, he discovered a box and learned that placing his hand inside the box would release $10,000 into the house. He did so, and became locked inside the box while the money fell into the backyard; the HouseGuests were able to keep the money, and {{were required to}} find a key to unlock Kevin from the room. On Day 56, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Morphomatic" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to correctly <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> two faces of the HouseGuests made up a set of alien faces.

The number of days they were incorrect would earn the HouseGuests a penalty point, and the HouseGuest with the lowest amount of penalty points was the winner. Jerry was the winner. In an attempt to keep their Renegades alliance intact, Dan and Memphis agreed that Memphis should make a deal with Jerry to keep herself safe. The two then decided that Memphis needed to win the Power of Veto, allowing them both to be safe and decide who would be evicted. On Day 53, Jerry chose to nominate Dan and Keesha for eviction.
