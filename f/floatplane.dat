50|$|<b>Floatplanes</b> {{often have}} floats that are {{interchangeable}} with wheeled landing gear (thereby producing a conventional land-based aircraft) however {{in cases where}} this is not practical amphibious <b>floatplanes,</b> such as the amphibious version of the DHC Otter, incorporate retractable wheels within their floats.|$|R
5|$|A single {{disassembled}} de Havilland DH.60 Moth <b>floatplane</b> was {{stored in}} the aircraft hold between the forward superstructure and the mainmast. Its components would be moved from the hold by the aircraft crane to the after deck where it could be assembled. Then the aircraft would be swayed over the side where it could be launched.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, {{during the}} First Shanghai Incident, Izumo became the {{flagship}} {{of the newly}} re-established 3rd Fleet that garrisoned Japanese-occupied China. Two years later, she was equipped to operate a <b>floatplane</b> at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the ship participated in the Battle of Shanghai in mid-1937 during which she provided naval gunfire support to Japanese troops ashore.|$|E
5|$|The Vought XSO2U was an American {{observation}} <b>floatplane</b> {{developed by}} Vought-Sikorsky for the United States Navy {{during the late}} 1930s. Intended to replace the Curtiss SOC Seagull in service as a scout aboard cruisers, it proved superior to the Curtiss SO3C in evaluation, but failed to win a production contract due to Vought's lack of manufacturing capacity.|$|E

5|$|At 22:00, as Scott's ships neared Cape Hunter at the {{northwest}} end of Guadalcanal, three of Scott's cruisers launched <b>floatplanes.</b> One crashed on takeoff, {{but the other}} two patrolled over Savo Island, Guadalcanal, and Ironbottom Sound. As the <b>floatplanes</b> were launched, Jojima's force was just passing around the mountainous northwestern shoulder of Guadalcanal, and neither force sighted each other. At 22:20, Jojima radioed Gotō {{and told him that}} no U.S. ships were in the vicinity. Although Jojima's force later heard Scott's <b>floatplanes</b> overhead while unloading along the north shore of Guadalcanal, they failed to report this to Gotō.|$|R
5|$|In May 1920, Australia {{participated in}} {{celebrations}} and naval activities {{associated with the}} visit of the Prince of Wales. From July to November 1920, an Avro 504 <b>floatplane</b> of the Australian Air Corps was embarked aboard Australia {{as part of a}} series of trials intended to cumulate {{in the creation of a}} naval aviation branch. The aircraft was stored on the quarterdeck next to 'Q' turret, and was deployed and recovered by derrick. Inter-service rivalry and the ship's reduction to non-seagoing status in September prevented further operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with flying-off {{platforms}} {{mounted on the}} roofs of 'B' and 'X' turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. During her early-1930s refit, the platforms {{were removed from the}} turrets and an extending Type EIT catapult was installed on the roof of 'X' turret, along with a crane to recover a <b>floatplane.</b> This was initially a Fairey IIIF until it was replaced by a Fairey Swordfish in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Although the RAF claimed six Italian {{aircraft}} {{destroyed and}} two probables, including Cullen's, on 20February, Italian sources reported only the Fiat G.50 of Tenente Alfredo Fusco of the 361a Squadriglia as shot down, killing the pilot, and the G.50 of Tenente Livio Bassi of 395a Squadriglia as damaged in combat and later destroyed by fire in an attempted forced landing at Berat. On 23February, Cullen attacked a CANT Z.506 three-engined <b>floatplane</b> {{as it was}} taking off at Preveza in Greece, at first simply attempting {{to prevent it from}} getting airborne but then, when it refused to stop, destroying it on a second pass. The result did not add to his official score, however, as the Italian plane was not in full flight {{at the time of its}} destruction.|$|E
5000|$|A {{controversy}} {{arose in}} 2008 {{over the use}} of <b>floatplanes</b> on Lows Lake, when the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation proposed allowing them to land on the lake for an additional ten-year period; under the 2003 Bog River Complex Unit Management Plan, DEC and the Adirondack Park Agency had agreed that <b>floatplanes</b> would be banned starting in January, 2008. Ultimately, the APA has decided to classify the lake as Wilderness, which will exclude <b>floatplanes</b> starting in 2011. [...] Much of the controversy arose about Lows Lake being a 'man-made' (Reservoir) lake with private property ownership on some of its perimeter.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the flyoff competition, the XSO2U-1 {{was used}} as a general utility {{aircraft}} and hack by the Navy, before being supplied to the Ranger Engine Corporation in July 1942 for use in tests of the V-770 engine. These tests were intended to assist in debugging the engine for the Bell XP-77 lightweight fighter and Edo XOSE <b>floatplane,</b> but the V-770 remained troublesome, and after two years of testing the XSO2U was returned to the Navy. Having no further use for the aircraft, the XSO2U-1 was removed from the Navy's rolls on 6 July 1944, being subsequently scrapped.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, an American {{film crew}} disappears in the Amazon {{rainforest}} while filming {{a documentary about}} indigenous cannibal tribes. The team consists of Alan Yates, the director; Faye Daniels, his girlfriend and script girl; and two cameramen, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. Harold Monroe, an anthropologist at New York University, agrees to lead a rescue team in hopes of finding the missing filmmakers. In anticipation of his arrival, the military conducts a raid on the local Yacumo tribe and takes a young male hostage {{in order to help}} negotiate with the natives. Monroe flies in via <b>floatplane</b> and is introduced to his guides, Chaco and his assistant, Miguel.|$|E
5|$|KzS Ernst-Ludwig Thienemann, the ship's final commander, took {{command of}} Admiral Scheer in April 1944.

The Soviet Air Force launched several air attacks on the German forces, all of which were successfully repelled by heavy anti-aircraft fire. The ship's Arado <b>floatplane</b> was shot down, however. On the night of 23–24 November, the German naval forces completed the evacuation of the island. In all, 4,694 troops were evacuated from the island.|$|E

5|$|Mutsu had an {{additional}} boom {{added to the}} mainmast in 1926 to handle the Yokosuka E1Y <b>floatplane</b> recently assigned to the ship. In 1933 a catapult was fitted between the mainmast and Turret No. 3, and a collapsible crane was installed in a port-side sponson the following year; the ship was equipped to operate two or three seaplanes, although no hangar was provided. The ship was operating Nakajima E4N2 biplanes until they were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938. A more powerful catapult was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft like the single Kawanishi E7K, added in 1939–40. Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943.|$|E

5|$|The Model 8-A, {{the export}} {{model of the}} Northrop Attack Bomber series was never {{intended}} {{to serve as the}} basis of a <b>floatplane</b> and had to be redesigned to meet the requirements of the Norwegian order. The new N-3PB was the first product of Northrop Aircraft, which had reformed in 1939, and was a low-winged cantilever monoplane fitted with twin floats. First intended for a lower powered engine, the N-3PB was ultimately powered by a Wright Cyclone radial engine, of the same type specified for the Douglas 8A-5N bombers and Curtiss Hawk 75A-8s ordered by Norway at the same time, simplifying the eventual maintenance and operation requirements for the entire Norwegian military aircraft fleets.|$|E
5|$|The young {{air force}} was a small, close-knit {{organisation}} comparable to a flying club, although several pioneering flights were undertaken by its members. One {{of the most}} notable was made by Goble and Flying Officer (later Flight Lieutenant) Ivor McIntyre in 1924, when they became the first men to circumnavigate Australia by air, in a single-engined Fairey IIID <b>floatplane.</b> The English-born McIntyre, who was lead pilot while Goble acted as commander and navigator, was also a World War I veteran of the Royal Naval Air Service. The purpose of the flight was to survey the northern coastline of Australia for defence planning, and to test {{the capabilities of the}} Fairey IIID.|$|E
5|$|With the Norwegian {{operation}} requirements {{drawn up}} for a coastal reconnaissance <b>floatplane,</b> a series of modifications were requested to the original design. The changes included a redesign of the float structure to accommodate either a torpedo or bomb load carried under the center fuselage to supplement five underwing bomb racks. Additional armament changes led {{to a combination of}} six machine guns replacing the four machine gun (two fixed forward, two flexible rear-mounted 7.9mm)/one cannon (forward facing, fixed 20mm) arrangement that was in the initial design. Provision for a rear under-fuselage gun was also made. Further equipment requirements including fitting a rear fuselage-mounted camera as well as changes to instrumentation and radio equipment.|$|E
