5|$|Occasionally a Portia {{is killed}} or injured while {{pursuing}} prey up to twice Portia′s size. In tests, P. schultzi is <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> 1.7% of pursuits and injured but not <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> 5.3%, P. labiata is <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> 2.1% and injured but not <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> 3.9%, and P. fimbriata in Queensland is <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> 0.06% of its pursuits and injured but not <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> another 0.06%. A Portia′s especially tough skin often prevents injury, even when its body {{is caught in}} the other spider's fangs. When injured, Portia bleeds and may sometimes loses one or more legs. Spiders' palps and legs break off easily when attacked, Portia′s palps and legs break off exceptionally easily, which may be a defence mechanism, and Portias are often seen with missing legs or palps, while other salticids in the same habitat are not seen with missing legs or palps.|$|E
