40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, {{we present}} an {{efficient}} method for supporting <b>full</b> <b>interactive</b> functions of MPEG- 2 video stream. This method {{is based on}} storing multiple different encoded {{versions of the same}} movie at the server. A normal version is used for normal playback, while several interactive versions are used for Fast/Slow/Jump Play. Interactive versions are produced by encoding every N-th frame of the original uncompressed video using different GOP pattern of the normal version. The effectiveness of our approach in terms of reducing the allocated bandwidth of the interactive stream is evaluated through extensive simulations. Moreover the visual quality during the interactive mode is analyzed and the effect of re-qunatization error is examined.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} a novel method for supporting <b>full</b> <b>interactive</b> video applications over wireless networks. A major limitation in wireless networks is that mobile users {{must rely on}} a battery with a limited supply of energy.

In this paper, we jointly consider source coding and dynamic allocation of the physical layer communication resources in a novel method. The proposed efficient approach achieves acceptable visual quality using minimum transmission energy, while satisfying delay constraints. Mechanism for controlling the interactive streams is also presented and its effectiveness is assessed through extensive simulations. Traditional interactive operations are supported with a minimum of additional resources on the server/network bandwidth and decoder complexity...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{numbers of}} {{qualitative}} health researchers of diverse disciplinary backgrounds {{are experimenting with}} various forms of performance (e. g., film, live theater, dance) as innovative approaches to engage broader communities in complex and critical ways with research. Despite this emerging alliance between performance and research, much of research-informed performance work is informed by an "aesthetic of objectivity," which assumes a linear trajectory between research findings and performance, and minimizes the relevance of aesthetic interpretation, which we argue is fundamental to achieving critical research-informed performative work. To move beyond this aesthetic of objectivity, we will explore our development of a research-informed film, "Fit for Dialysis.

Results indicated that the coupled configuration (CGCM) extends MJO predictability over that of the AGCM, by up to 3 - 5 days. Propagation is improved in the CGCM, which we partly attribute to a more realistic phase relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and convection. In addition, the CGCM demonstrates skill in representing downwelling oceanic Kelvin and Rossby waves which warm SSTs along their trajectory, with the potential to feed back on the atmosphere. These results imply that an ocean model capable of simulating internal ocean waves may be required to capture the full effect of air-sea coupling for the MJO...|$|R
40|$|The tropospheric {{response}} to sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) is analyzed in an idealized model setup regarding the respective roles of planetary-scale and synoptic-scale waves.

In both runs, the tropospheric response {{is characterized by the}} negative phase of the respective tropospheric annular mode. But given their different latitudinal structure, the control run shows the expected response, i. e.,an equatorward shift of the tropospheric jet, whereas the response in the absence of interactive synoptic eddies is characterized by a poleward jet shift. This opposite jet shift is associated with a different planetary wave variability that couples with the zonal flow between the stratosphere and the surface. These results indicate that the synoptic eddy feedback is necessary for the observed tropospheric {{response to}} SSWs...|$|R

40|$|Invited paper) With the {{proliferation}} of IP networking and wireless access, local exchange carriers (LEC) are under tremendous pressure to evolve into broadband service providers. On-demand video distribution to the mass appears {{to be one of}} the best evolution paths for the LEC. Various approaches for providing on-demand content/video distribution to massive viewers are compared. In particular, a novel low-cost network architecture called DINA for distributing video content to massive viewers is described.

Furthermore, it offers <b>full</b> <b>interactive</b> functions to the viewers and readily deployable over existing broadband network infrastructures. An innovative technique to offer low-cost on-demand video services to massive subscribers called multi-stream multicasting is described. It employs fixed but irregular stream intervals that can significantly reduce the startup latency. Many fault protection mechanisms are built into the DINA architecture to improve the robustness. DINA also offers additional protection against copyright infringement and has been demonstrated commercially...|$|R

Nevertheless, even the fairly demanding writing assignment was generally perceived to be interesting and useful: while its <b>full</b> <b>interactive</b> potential was not realized due to the participants’ reluctance to engage in editing, the wiki is clearly an efficient tool for promoting academic literacy...|$|R

The users of such infrastructures want {{to benefit from}} <b>full</b> <b>interactive</b> environments based on multimedia streams (voice, video, virtual reality) which are difficult to design and support {{on a large scale}} basis. In this paper, we present a new approach to support the streaming of live flows between e-Researchers. We show that traditional techniques (using TCP-based live streaming) are unsuitable for infrastructures with long delay and high loss rate. TCP introduces rate oscillations and requires more buffering and bandwidth to sustain a smooth playback. We propose a streaming framework which provides smoother rate control than TCP and improves streaming performance based on crosslayer feedback between the transport protocol and the streaming server. Our solution keeps the buffer usage at the client and server to a minimum level and provides quick rate adaptation. This paper presents simulation results for streaming in different eResearch scenarios...|$|R
