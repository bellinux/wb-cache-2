5|$|Scientists {{still do}} not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> {{mechanisms}} by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, {{many of which are}} otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.|$|E
5|$|Catesby {{waited for}} Percy's {{return from the}} north, before making his decision. He thought the letter too vague to {{constitute}} any meaningful threat to the plan, and decided to forge ahead. As Fawkes made a final check on the gunpowder, other conspirators took up their positions in the Midlands. Salisbury, already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, did not yet <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> nature of the plot or who exactly was involved. He elected to wait, to see how events unfolded. On 3November, Catesby met with Wintour and Percy in London. Although {{the nature of their}} discussion is unknown, Fraser theorises that some adjustment of their plan to abduct Princess Elizabeth may have occurred, as later accounts told how Percy had been seen at the Duke of York's lodgings, enquiring as to the movements of the king's daughter. Nicholls mentions that a week earlier—on the same day that Monteagle received his letter—Catesby was at White Webbs with Fawkes, to discuss kidnapping Prince Henry rather than Princess Elizabeth.|$|E

25|$|The Hongwu Emperor {{believed}} that only government couriers and lowly retail merchants {{should have the}} right to travel far outside their home town. Despite his efforts to impose this view, his building of an efficient communication network for his military and official personnel strengthened and fomented the rise of a potential commercial network running parallel to the courier network. The shipwrecked Korean Ch'oe Pu (1454–1504) remarked in 1488 how the locals along the eastern coasts of China did not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> distances between certain places, which was virtually exclusive knowledge of the Ministry of War and courier agents. This was in stark contrast to the late Ming period, when merchants not only traveled further distances to convey their goods, but also bribed courier officials to use their routes and even had printed geographical guides of commercial routes that imitated the couriers' maps.|$|E
25|$|The {{first and}} largest wave of {{immigration}} from the Middle East began around 1880, and remained {{during the first}} two decades of the twentieth century. They were mainly Maronite Christians from Greater Syria (Syria and Lebanon) and Palestine, fleeing the then colonized Ottoman territories. Syrians, Palestinians, and Lebanese continued since then to settle in Colombia. Due to poor existing information it's impossible to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> number of Lebanese and Syrians that immigrated to Colombia. A figure of 5,000-10,000 from 1880 to 1930 may be reliable. Whatever the figure, Syrians and Lebanese are perhaps the biggest immigrant group next to the Spanish since independence. Those who left their homeland in the Middle East to settle in Colombia left for different reasons such as religious, economic, and political reasons. Some left to experience the adventure of migration. After Barranquilla and Cartagena, Bogota stuck next to Cali, among cities with the largest number of Arabic-speaking representatives in Colombia in 1945. The Arabs that went to Maicao were mostly Sunni Muslim with some Druze and Shiites, as well as Orthodox and Maronite Christians. The mosque of Maicao is the second largest mosque in Latin America. Middle Easterns are generally called Turcos (Turkish).|$|E

500|$|If any {{method is}} ever successful, {{there is the}} {{suggestion}} to introduce the hybrids to a wildlife reserve in Siberia called the Pleistocene Park. Some biologists question the ethics of such recreation attempts. In addition to the technical problems, {{there is not much}} habitat left that would be suitable for elephant-mammoth hybrids. Because both species are [...] social and gregarious, creating a few specimens would not be ideal. The time and resources required would be enormous, and the scientific benefits would be unclear, suggesting these resources should instead be used to preserve extant elephant species which are endangered. The ethics of using elephants as surrogate mothers in hybridization attempts has also been questioned, as most embryos would not survive, and {{it would be impossible to}} <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> needs of a hybrid elephant-mammoth calf.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{was already}} aware of certain stirrings even before he {{received}} the letter, Cecil did not yet <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> nature of the plot or who was involved and had elected to watch {{to see what would}} happen.

[...] The following day, members of the Privy Council visited James to inform him that a search would be made of the Houses of Parliament, [...] "both above and below". [...] Meanwhile, Tresham again urged Catesby and Wintour to abandon the scheme, but his attempts were in vain. [...] Fellow plotter Thomas Percy said he was ready to [...] "abide the uttermost trial", and subsequently on 4November Catesby and several others left London for the Midlands to prepare for the planned uprising.|$|E
500|$|Uncertain of the letter's meaning, Monteagle {{promptly}} rode to Whitehall {{and handed}} it to Cecil (then Earl of Salisbury). [...] Salisbury informed the Earl of Worcester, considered to have recusant sympathies, and the suspected catholic Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, but kept news of the plot from the King, who was busy hunting in Cambridgeshire and not expected back for several days. [...] Monteagle's servant, Thomas Ward, had family connections with the Wright brothers, and sent a message to Catesby about the betrayal. [...] Catesby, who had been due to go hunting with the King, suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter, and with Thomas Wintour confronted the recently recruited conspirator. [...] Tresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter, but urged them to abandon the plot. [...] Salisbury was already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, but did not yet <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> nature of the plot, or who exactly was involved.

500|$|On Saturday 26 October, at {{his house}} in Hoxton, Monteagle {{received}} an anonymous letter that warned him {{to stay away from}} Parliament.

[...] Instead of informing the king immediately, he decided to wait and watch what happened. [...] Catesby's reaction to news of the letter's existence was somewhat different; he and Wintour suspected Francis Tresham was its author and the two went to confront him. [...] Tresham managed to convince them of his innocence, all the while urging them to abandon the plot. [...] Percy reacted to the news by declaring that he was ready to [...] "abide the uttermost trial". [...] He may have visited the infant Prince Charles on 1 November, indicating perhaps that some rearrangement of the plan was being considered.
