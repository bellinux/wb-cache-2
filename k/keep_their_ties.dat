The municipality is losing population, with many leaving to work in nearby Mexico City. However, most of these people <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> <b>ties</b> to their home municipality. Only about one percent of the municipality’s residents were born somewhere else. Despite, its proximity to Mexico City and Toluca, the municipality is rural with only limited development.|$|E
5000|$|An {{analysis}} of this data for {{the era of the}} Nazis' rule is available in a paper by Sven Granzow et al., published in a collection edited by Götz Aly. Altogether more Protestants than Catholics left their church, however, overall Protestants and Catholics decided similarly. One has {{to keep in mind that}} German Protestants were twice the number of Catholics. The spike in the numbers from 1937-38 is the result of the annexation of Austria in 1938 and other territories. The number of Kirchenaustritte reached its [...] "historical high" [...] in 1939 when it peaked at 480,000. Granzow et al. see the numbers not only in relation to the Nazi policy towards the churches, (which changed drastically from 1935 onwards) but also as indicator of the trust in the Führer and the Nazi leadership. The decline in the number of people who left the church after 1942 is explained as resulting from a loss of confidence in the future of Nazi Germany. People tended to <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> <b>ties</b> to the church, because they feared an uncertain future.|$|E
40|$|The media, {{which offers}} {{limitless}} possibilities, represents the interlocking cultural environment of our day; television series, advertisements, competitions, virtual platforms {{present at the}} same time all around the world and the loneliness created by these environments underline the value of digital mediums. Television has a huge role as a digital advertising mean; as a medium that calls out to the five senses, it has an effective role as a medium. Furthermore, because television can reach out to more than one person in the same environment {{at the same time}}, it also serves as a cultural forger. Individuals living away from their homelands use television in order to <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> <b>ties</b> with their home countries. There are specific advertisements targeted at these migratory cultures; these advertisements keep communities together as they are equipped with visual indicators that uphold traditional customs and values. Thus institutions uphold their missions, visions and ideolojies through the advertisement or the name of the brand advertised. In our study, we will be looking at the visual reflection of brand advertisements directed at people living away from their home countries and how institutions impose their ideolojies visually. Using Marshall McLuhan’s “the medium is the message” statement, cultural indicators used to convey the ideological messages will be determined. In this study, a survey was conducted with Turkish immigrants living in Holland; through this survey, their cultural ideology was determined. In the advertisement chosen, the links between the ideological approach of the brand name and the ideological approach of the immigrants was evaluated and analyzed...|$|E

30|$|As it is shown, the {{importance}} of the Triple Helix agents in supporting business development varies from one stage to another, and what is more, their role has evolved during this 10 -years period. Specifically, universities keep their important role during the inception stage of companies. A new industry agent raised at this stage, namely, accelerators. Business angels are also increasing the role of industry at this early stage. Government is trying to get closer to both universities and industry enlarging the collaboration area. At the launching phase, few changes are observed in the relative importance of each agent. Universities and industry are strengthening their ties, while government adopts a secondary role. Next, as companies grow, their necessities change and regulations start to affect them. Thus, during the growing stage, public administration has a slightly bigger influence, allowing companies to showcase their solutions in cities and through policy regulations. On the contrary, at this stage, universities seem to lose part of their influence but less than they did 10 [*]years ago, as they can <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> <b>ties</b> with their startups for a longer period through their VC funds. Finally, during maturity, industry remains the most important agent at this stage. Administration keeps its role as a regulator while universities continue to supply human capital and new ideas although some think their relevance has declined with firm growth and the revival of corporate research labs. Less interaction between the three agents is identified compared to 10 [*]years ago. To sum up, as an innovative ecosystem evolves, so does the role played by the Triple Helix agents.|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has fueled {{a heated debate}} about the responsibility of financialeconomists. Critics such as Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and David Colander arguethat financial economists have developed useless or even harmful theories. This isan important debate, but it suffers {{from the fact that}} the role of financial theoriesremains unclear. In this chapter we enter the field of philosophy of science to clarifythis issue. In particular, we emphasize the research interests and the various philosophicalassumptions of three alternative views on financial theories. We analyzethe widespread positivistic conception of financial theories and contrast it with apostmodern perspective. We conclude that both positions have limitations. As analternative, we outline a constructivist conception of financial theories. In the finalsection, we use these insights from philosophy of science to clarify the responsibilityof financial economists. Financial economists have to critically reflect the problemsin practice that need to be addressed and to <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> theories closely <b>tied</b> to theseoriginal problems. We show how, in the case of the efficient market hypothesis, themisunderstanding of the role of financial theories led financial economists to neglectthis responsibility...|$|R
50|$|Women {{also have}} {{different}} types of dresses. The most commonly worn are Ìró (wrapper) and Bùbá (blouse-like loose top). Women also have matching Gèlè (head gear) that must be put on whenever the Ìró and Bùbá is on. Just as the cap (Fìlà) is important to men, women's dressing is considered incomplete without Gèlè. It may be of plain cloth or costly as the women can afford. Apart from this, they also have ìborùn (Shawl) and Ìpèlé (which are long pieces of fabric that usually hang on the left shoulder and stretch from the hind {{of the body to}} the fore). At times, it is <b>tied</b> round <b>their</b> waists over the original one piece wrapper. Unlike men, women have two types of under wears (Èwù Àwòtélè), called; Tòbi and Sinmí. Tòbi is like the modern day apron with strings and spaces in which women can <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> valuables. They <b>tie</b> the tòbi around the waists before putting on the Ìró (wrapper). Sinmí is like a sleeveless T-shirt that is worn under before wearing any other dress on the upper body.|$|R
