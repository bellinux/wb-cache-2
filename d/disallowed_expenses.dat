25|$|In England, he {{was called}} before Parliament to testify on {{the conduct of the}} war, and on several {{occasions}} required to support his expenditures during his various campaigns (for which he {{is said to have been}} imprisoned at one point). He purchased an estate at Belmont, Kent, had a residence at Portland Place, London, and he served as director of the French Hospital. He toured Europe in 1785 and 1786, visiting France, Germany and Switzerland. In his later years, his accounts came under scrutiny, and much of his property was seized by the state to recover <b>disallowed</b> <b>expenses.</b> He died in Maidstone prison, where he was incarcerated apparently in connection with his outstanding debts, in June 1799.|$|E
50|$|Disposable {{income is}} monthly income minus {{allowable}} monthly expenses. It {{is important to}} recognize that the IRS will not allow all expenses the taxpayer may actually have. Common <b>disallowed</b> <b>expenses</b> are college tuition payments for a dependent and credit card payments (disallowed since they represent unsecured debt).|$|E
50|$|Differences in expense {{allocation}} {{rules and}} transfer pricing can impact this result. If, {{in the example}} above, Carpet Ltd had £10,000 of expenses of the Germany operation which Germany disallowed as not allocable to German income under German concepts, the German tax would increase to £40,700 while the UK FTC limitation would remain £33,000. This would increase worldwide taxes by the German tax on the <b>disallowed</b> <b>expenses,</b> {{to a total of}} £337,300.|$|E
50|$|The UK scheme allows {{losses of}} one group member to be {{relieved}} (deducted) by members {{using a different}} accounting period, with certain adjustments. Trading (business) losses, capital losses, certain excess (<b>disallowed)</b> management <b>expenses</b> from non-UK affiliates, and certain excess charges may be relieved, subject to limitations. The surrender of these items is done by one company {{for the benefit of}} one other company.|$|R
5000|$|Most jurisdictions {{provide that}} taxable income {{may be reduced}} by amounts {{expended}} as interest on loans. By contrast, most do not provide tax relief for distributions to owners. Thus, an enterprise is motivated to finance its subsidiary enterprises through loans rather than capital. Many jurisdictions have adopted [...] "thin capitalization" [...] rules to limit such charges. Various approaches include limiting deductibility of interest expense to a portion of cash flow, <b>disallowing</b> interest <b>expense</b> on debt in excess of a certain ratio, and other mechanisms.|$|R
5000|$|On October 28, 2015, he {{was granted}} an {{absolute}} discharge by Quebec Court Judge Valmont Beaulieu; hence, {{he was not}} incarcerated and will avoid having a criminal record. However, The Globe and Mail newspaper reported that [...] "Brazeau remained suspended from the upper chamber, and his salary is being clawed back to repay nearly $50,000 in <b>disallowed</b> housing <b>expense</b> claims." [...] Brazeau returned to his seat in the Senate in September 2016 after charges of fraud and breach of trust related to his expense claims were withdrawn by the Crown.|$|R
50|$|United States federal {{corporate}} tax returns require both computation of taxable income from components thereof and reconciliation of taxable income to financial statement income. Corporations with assets exceeding $10 million must complete a detailed 3 page reconciliation on Schedule M-3 indicating which differences are permanent (i.e., do not reverse, such as <b>disallowed</b> <b>expenses</b> or tax exempt interest) {{and which are}} temporary (e.g., differences in when income or expense is recognized for book and tax purposes).|$|E

40|$|Generally, {{reasonable}} {{expenses incurred}} {{in the ordinary}} and necessary course of a legitimate trade or business are deductible from gross income under the U. S. Tax Code; however {{in an effort to}} curb tobacco use, recent legislation has disallowed this benefit to tobacco companies for advertising expenses. The judiciary has upheld this disallowance under the doctrine of legislative grace. This thesis critiques the doctrine of legislative grace along with a review Congress’s power to tax income and the role of deductions. Also, the possibility of <b>disallowing</b> business <b>expenses</b> under public policy grounds is examined, and the relationship between lobbying expenses and advertising expenses is analyzed. Finally, the author suggests alternative methods to reduce tobacco use such as a special tax on tobacco companies to finance a public awareness campaign, stricter penalties for selling tobacco to minors, and an outright ban on tobacco advertising...|$|R
40|$|This paper shows how, under {{existing}} tax law, illegal wage underpayment by {{an employer}} (sometimes called “wage theft”) may generate employer tax liability for unreported income or <b>disallowed</b> business <b>expense</b> deductions. Given {{that the tax}} authority needs information from the underpaid worker to prove such liability, the paper identifies two ways that a worker can transmit that information to a tax authority: becoming a tax informant, or bringing a qui tam action under a state false claims act. Finally, the paper discusses possible influences on {{the decision of the}} unpaid worker to inform on the employer to the tax authority, and considers the conditions under which a tax authority is likely to audit an employer based on such information. In so doing, the paper identifies a new approach to combating wage theft and an undiscovered implication of basic income tax law...|$|R
40|$|The sale of {{an entity}} as a going concern {{has a number}} of tax {{consequences}} for both the purchaser and the seller. The tax deductibility of a contingent liability upon its transfer from the seller to the purchaser, where the selling price has been reduced by the value of the contingent liabilities transferred, remains uncertain following the decision in Ackermans Ltd v Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service. An expense is either deductible under a specific section of the Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962, or under the general expense provisions in terms of sections 11 (a) and 23 (g). The Act does not contain a specific section relating to contingent liabilities and therefore a contingent liability will need to be considered for deduction under these sections. The Act further <b>disallows</b> an <b>expense</b> as a deduction under section 23 (e), where a reserve is created (for example a leave pay provision). This study analyses the tax deductibility of a contingent liability, where the contingent liability has been transferred from the seller to the purchaser in a sale of an entity as a going concern and the purchase price has been reduced to compensate for the transfer of the contingent liability. The deductibility of the contingent liability was first assessed in terms of the provisions of the Act (sections 11 (a), 23 (g) and 23 (e)) and associated case law. The decision in the Ackermans case and its preceding Income Tax Case 1839 was then analysed in order to establish the principles arising from the decisions. Finally the proposals in the Draft Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, 2011, and the subsequent Discussion Document issued by the South African Revenue Service were discussed. The analysis revealed the continuing confusion surrounding the status quo, thus demonstrating the importance of legislative intervention to provide guidelines for taxpayers...|$|R
