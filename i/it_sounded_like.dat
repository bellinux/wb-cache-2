In 1995, despite {{a lack of}} support for a name change, the institution, considering that its regional educational mission was not reflected in its name (some thought that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a private school), adopted the name The University of West Alabama. Ed Roach (1998–2002) assumed the presidency in 1998 and set about integrating technology into every aspect of UWA life. He established the Technology 2000 campaign and helped establish UWA {{as one of the first}} wireless institutions in the region. Women's sports received a boost under his leadership. During this period, the UWA Softball Complex was completed. In February 2002, he stepped down from his position as president. The Board of Trustees met to choose a replacement on an interim basis from University employees David Taylor, Richard Holland, Roy Underwood, and Clemit Spruiell.|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} {{originally}} entitled We Are Mongrels, but the title {{had to be}} changed for two reasons: one was that the title was too similar to another BBC Three comedy show, We Are Klang. The other {{is that none of}} the characters were mongrels. Therefore, new suggestions were called for. Rejected titles included I, Nelson; Humans! Everywhere!; Undergrowth and Never Been Stroked. The last of these titles was rejected after one of the show's additional writers, Danielle Ward; [...] "said <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> 'a makeover show for virgins'." [...] During this time the crew referred to the show as Mongrels and it eventually became the show's title.|$|E

500|$|The wagtail is very [...] "chatty" [...] and has {{a number}} of {{distinct}} vocalisations. Its most-recognised sound is its alarm call which is a rapid chit-chit-chit-chit, although it has more melodious sounds in its repertoire. The alarm call is sounded to warn off potential rivals and threats from its territory and also seems to serve as a signal to its mate when a potential threat is in the area. John Gould reported that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a child's rattle or [...] "small cog-wheels of a steam mill". In his book What Bird is That? (1935), Neville Cayley writes that it has [...] "a pleasant call resembling sweet pretty little creature, frequently uttered during the day or night, especially on moonlight nights".|$|E

500|$|... "Irreplaceable JP" [...] {{was written}} for Chrisette Michele. Production team Stargate and singer-songwriter Ne-Yo had written for Beyoncé's second album B'Day, but Tor Erik Hermansen of Stargate said {{that they might not}} have gone in the {{direction}} they did on the song. The tune did not suit Beyoncé's voice, and Ne-Yo wrote the lyrics from a male perspective, although it was not based upon his personal experiences. Ne-Yo wrote the song in the country style, thinking of country singers Shania Twain and Faith Hill during the sessions. When Ne-Yo heard them playing the song with a guitar, he thought <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> country music. But when the drums were incorporated into the music, it was brought to an R vibe, and Ne-Yo considered making an R western music song instead.|$|E

Jean stated that her performance was [...] "terrific" [...] {{and that she was}} [...] "wonderful to work with", although there was one line in particular that she had difficulty performing.

Originally, she would have said [...] "you snorted my father's ashes", but because of Rossellini's accent, <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> she said [...] "you snorted my father's ass", according to Jean.
