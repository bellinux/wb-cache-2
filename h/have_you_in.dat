The Jay-Z-collaboration is a critique on the hip hop industry, its detrimental effects, and {{the trappings of}} being an artist: [...] "While all my closest friends out partyin'/ I'm just here makin' the music that they party to," [...] while Jay-Z gives advice: [...] "Drake, here's how they gonna come at you / with silly rap feuds, trying to distract you." [...] Jay-Z expands on the album's overarching theme of self-doubt: [...] "And since no good deed go unpunished / I'm not as cool with niggaz as I once was / I once was cool as the Fonz was / But these bright lights turned me to a monster."

500|$|It {{appeared}} that [...] "Hard Luck Houtteman" [...] had returned as the 1952 Detroit Tigers season began. On April 2, 1952, {{just before the}} season started, Art lost his seven-month-old daughter in an automobile accident. In an April 26 matchup against the Cleveland Indians, with two outs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, Houtteman was one out away from a no-hitter when he threw a fastball that was [...] "supposed to sink" [...] but did not, which Harry hit for a single. [...] Houtteman said, [...] "This was the only pitch I shook Ginsberg off the whole game", and for years afterwards, catcher Joe Ginsberg repeatedly said to Houtteman, [...] "If you'd listened to me, I'd <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the Hall of Fame". Detroit won the game by a score of 13–0. After losing his tenth game on June 22, manager Red Rolfe moved Houtteman out of the starting rotation and into the bullpen. He finished the year with an 8–20 record and a 4.36 ERA. His 20th loss came on September 21 against the Indians, and he became the first Tiger to lose 20 games since Bobo Newsom in 1941. His disappointing season led to the possibility of a trade, with general manager Charlie Gehringer acknowledging that Houtteman might be traded if the right offer came along.|$|E

2500|$|On June 12, 1942, Bong flew {{very low}} ("buzzed") over {{a house in}} nearby San Anselmo, {{the home of a}} pilot who had just been married. He was cited and {{temporarily}} grounded for breaking flying rules, along with three other P-38 pilots who had looped around the Golden Gate Bridge on the same day. For looping the Golden Gate Bridge, flying at a low level down Market Street in San Francisco, and blowing the clothes off of an Oakland woman's clothesline, Bong was reprimanded by General George C. Kenney, commanding officer of the Fourth Air Force, who told him, [...] "If you didn't want to fly down Market Street, I wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> my Air Force, but you are not to do it any more and I mean what I say." [...] Kenney later wrote, [...] "We needed kids like this lad." [...] In all subsequent accounts, Bong denied flying under the Golden Gate Bridge. Nevertheless, Bong was still grounded when the rest of his group was sent without him to England in July 1942. Bong then transferred to another Hamilton Field unit, 84th Fighter Squadron of the 78th Fighter Group. From there, Bong was sent to the Southwest Pacific Area.|$|E
2500|$|On the October 7, 2008 {{episode of}} Making the Band, Combs {{stated that he}} did have Richard on three demos for his new album. On the same episode of the show, after {{continued}} debate with O'Day about the well-being of Danity Kane, he stated that O'Day {{was no longer in}} the group, as had been foreshadowed in an earlier episode within the season after a TRL (Total Request Live) appearance. Combs was unaware of the specific problems within the group, but sensed that O'Day and Aundrea Fimbres, who were originally close friends, had drastically drifted apart. O'Day and Richard informed Combs that the entire group had trust issues with management and ultimately each other. The season finale, which took place Tuesday, October 14, 2008, confirmed the departure of O'Day and Woods. Combs removed Woods due to feeling that she was unhappy with the group and that she had gotten [...] "caught up in the wrath" [...] of close friend O'Day. In the live section of the episode, Combs explained that the reason he let O'Day go was that she was not the same person he signed, that the fame had changed her (as had been expressed on the August 28, 2008 episode). [...] "I got love for Aubrey," [...] he said. [...] "I don't have any beef with her. I just want to work with the young lady that I signed, not the person that fame has made her." [...] He later stated that he would be open to working with Woods again. When O'Day came on to reply, just moments after deciding not to leave the studio, she first addressed the perception some people, especially bloggers, have of her. [...] "I would rather be hated every damn day of my life for being real than loved for being something I'm not," [...] she stated. Combs, who spoke to the group and the audience via satellite, relayed to O'Day, [...] "Check this out, baby girl... See, your attitude is gonna <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a dark and lonely place. ... What you need to do, {{at the end of the}} day, is humble yourself." [...] Woods did not appear on the live episode due to prior obligations.|$|E

2500|$|When Ray Illingworth left Yorkshire in 1968 after a {{contract}} dispute {{it looked like}} the 36-year-old off-spinner's Test career was over. However, he transferred to Leicestershire and was made county captain. Although he had never been captain his great experience and knowledge of the game were widely believed to have guided Yorkshire to their County Championship victories in 1966, 1967 and 1968. He had an immediate effect on the unfancied Midlands side, which would take them to four one day trophies in the early 1970s and the County Championship in 1975. The selectors had long regarded Kent's Colin Cowdrey as England's natural captain, but he broke an Achilles tendon early in the season and Illingworth was his surprise replacement after only a month as county captain. Illingworth had {{been in and out of}} the national side for years and had taken 20 wickets (13.30) against India in 1967 and 13 more (22.39) against Australia in 1968. He was chosen over his rivals such as former captain Brian Close or vice-captain Tom Graveney as he was not a threat to Cowdrey's long-term captaincy due to his age and inability to establish a regular spot in the Test team. In the Second Test against the West Indies at Lord's England collapsed to 61/5, but the new skipper made a forceful 113 out of the last 155 runs and became a hero. He beat both the West Indies and New Zealand 2-0 and remained captain even when Cowdrey recovered. In 1970 Illingworth had yet to lose a Test and overall he captained England in 31 Tests in 1969-73, winning 12, drawing 14 and losing 5. The Yorkshireman was 'tough, combative, grudging, shrewd, and an instinctive reader of the game', and an experienced, non-nonsense captain who expected his team to play like professionals. David Gower wrote 'no matter how highly Ray might regard you as a player he would not <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> his team, come hell or high water, unless he was utterly convinced that you could do the job he had allocated to you'.
