2500|$|The {{history of}} the 5-HT3 {{receptor}} antagonists began in 1957, when J.H. Gaddum and Zuleika P. Picarelli at the University of Edinburgh proposed the existence of two serotonin receptor subtypes, the M and D receptors (thus named because their function could be blocked by morphine and dibenzyline respectively), in a landmark paper. The 5-HT3 receptor was later found to correspond to the M receptor. In the 1970s, John Fozard found that metoclopramide and cocaine were weak antagonists at the 5-HT3 (5-HT-M) receptor. Fozard and Maurice Gittos later synthesized MDL 72222, the first potent and truly selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.

Single intravenous doses of 1. 8 or 2. 4 mg/kg of <b>dolasetron</b> mesilate or 3 mg of granisetron hydrochloride were administered in a volume of 50 ml over a 5 -min period, beginning 30 min prior to cisplatin (≥ 80 mg/m 2) administration. The number and timing of emetic episodes, time to administration of escape anti-emetic medication, severity of nausea by visual analogue scale (VAS), and safety were monitored for 24 h after the start of cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. Investigators' evaluations of overall efficacy and patients' satisfaction with therapy were recorded {{at the end of the}} 24 -h study period. Of the 474 patients evaluable for efficacy, complete responses were achieved by 54, 47 and 48 % of patients given <b>dolasetron</b> mesilate 1. 8 mg/kg, <b>dolasetron</b> mesilate 2. 4 mg/kg and granisetron, respectively. Statistically, treatment groups had comparable complete and complete plus major responses, times to first emesis, and use of escape medication; patient maximum nausea severity and treatment satisfaction ratings; and physician nausea severity and overall efficacy assessments. For the majority of efficacy endpoints, 1. 8 mg/kg <b>dolasetron</b> mesilate produced numerically superior responses compared with the 2. 4 mg/kg dose. Gender and prior chemotherapy were significant predictors of complete response; males and chemotherapy-naive patients had higher responses.

40|$|AbstractBackground:Of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved 5 -hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5 -HT 3) -receptor antagonists, <b>dolasetron,</b> ondan-setron, granisetron, and {{palonosetron}}, only <b>dolasetron</b> and palonosetron have {{a precaution}} in their FDA labeling concerning corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation. At FDA approved doses, QTc prolongation {{has been observed}} in clinical trials with some 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists (however, palonosetron has been only recently approved, with few published clinical data available). However, due to patient exclusion criteria, such trials with 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists may have failed to examine the risk of these agents in “real world” patients with cancer. Objective:The aim of this analysis {{was to assess the}} potential risk for selected cardiac adverse events associated with <b>dolasetron,</b> ondansetron, and granisetron use. Methods:The FDA combined Spontaneous Reporting System/Adverse Event Reporting System database was analyzed. The process of analyzing such a database for early warnings of potential hazards is known as signal generation. The statistical technique proportional reporting ratio (PRR) was used to aid detection of a potential signal within the database. PRR is the observed proportion of a given adverse event for the drug of interest (the number of events of interest for the drug divided {{by the total number of}} reports for the drug) divided by the expected proportion. Through the third quarter of 2002, the database was searched using the preferred term electrocardiogram qt corrected interval prolonged. Results:One, 3, and 0 cases were reported for <b>dolasetron,</b> ondansetron, andgranisetron, respectively. The number of cases did not satisfy 1 of the 3 criteria we utilized to define a potential signal, the 3 criteria being: 3 or more reported cases of the adverse event, a PRR value of at least 2, and a χ 2 value of > 4. As this term may be unlikely to be reported, the database was also searched using the term ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. The PRR, used as a parameter to detect a potential signal within the database, was 3. 23, 1. 31, and 1. 13 for <b>dolasetron,</b> ondansetron, and granisetron, respectively. The number of observed ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrests was ∼ 3 -fold higher with <b>dolasetron</b> compared with the expected value (calculated by dividing the individual agent's total number of events reported by the proportion of adverse events for all agents combined). The results for <b>dolasetron</b> fulfilled the criteria we used to define a potential signal. Conclusions:This analysis detected a potential signal for ventricular arrhythmiasand cardiac arrest with <b>dolasetron,</b> but not with ondansetron or granisetron. However, there are limitations of a PRR analysis, which include only measuring cases that have been reported, providing relative frequencies instead of actual rates, and not providing information on the severity of adverse events or causal relationships. In addition, our analysis does not include consideration of concomitant medications, and only 2 search terms were used. Errors in identifying potential signals may also include confounding factors, such as the underlying disease, potential confusion with reporting under trade and generic names, and potential multiple reporting of the same case...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Patients may {{experience}} nausea and vomiting when undergoing chemotherapy or surgery requiring anesthesia. Serotonin 5 -hydroxytryptamine 3 (5 -HT 3) receptor antagonists are effective antiemetics, yet may cause adverse cardiac events, such as arrhythmia. We aimed to identify interventions that mitigate the cardiac risk of 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists. Methods Electronic databases, trial registries, and references were searched. Studies on patients undergoing chemotherapy or surgery examining interventions to monitor cardiac risk of 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists were included. Search results were screened and data from relevant studies were abstracted in duplicate. Risk of bias of included studies {{was assessed using}} the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) group’s risk-of-bias tool. Due to a dearth of included studies, meta-analysis was not conducted. Results Two randomized clinical trials (RCT) and 1 non-randomized clinical trial (NRCT) were included after screening 7, 637 titles and abstracts and 1, 554 full-text articles. Intravenous administration of different <b>dolasetron</b> doses was examined in the NRCT, while <b>dolasetron</b> versus ondansetron and palonosetron versus ondansetron were examined in the RCT. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was the only intervention examined to mitigate cardiac harm. No differences in ECG evaluations were observed between <b>dolasetron</b> or palonosetron versus ondansetron after 15  minutes, 24  hours, and 1  week post-administration in the 2 RCTs. Four deaths were observed in one RCT, which were deemed unrelated to palonosetron or ondansetron administration. Minor increases in PR and QT intervals were observed in the NRCT for <b>dolasetron</b> dosages greater than 1. 2  mg/kg 1 – 2 hours post-administration, but were deemed not clinically relevant. Conclusions ECG monitoring of chemotherapy patients administered with 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists did not reveal clinically significant differences in arrhythmia between the medications at the examined time periods. The usefulness of ECG to monitor chemotherapy patients administered with 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists remains unclear, as all patients received ECG monitoring.

40|$|The {{serotonin}} 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists or `setrons' {{have become}} the standard of care {{for the prevention of}} chemotherapy-induced emesis (CIE) and are first-line therapy for acute CIE in healthcare organisations worldwide. However, their superior efficacy versus standard antiemetics comes at a significant cost. Currently, 3 agents are available in the US: ondansetron, granisetron and <b>dolasetron.</b> The most important treatment-related factor contributing to CIE is the emetogenicity of chemotherapy. The ability to customise, or stratify, the setron dose to match the emetogenic challenge of the chemotherapy administered has potential benefits, both clinically and economically. In adults, there is an appreciable amount of clinical literature addressing stratified administration; however, the amount of `hard' economic data is rather limited. Intuitively, if clinical outcomes are equivalent, then stratified administration should be associated with economic benefits, as it generally promotes the use of doses lower than those recommended by the manufacturer. The literature strongly substantiates this for ondansetron, but is not as favourable for granisetron or <b>dolasetron.</b> As the rationale and justification for dose stratification is contained in the clinical literature, the authors have reviewed the pertinent literature supporting the clinical and economic benefits of dose stratification in both adult and paediatric patients. The authors also provide a discussion of various additional strategies that can be employed to ensure the appropriate and cost-effective use of setrons in real-world practice settings. These strategies include the use of lower doses than recommended by manufacturers, use for acute versus delayed phase emesis, enhancing the antiemetic efficacy by the addition of a corticosteroid, use of oral versus injectable formulations (when appropriate) and the implementation and use of local, national and international drug use guidelines.

There are a variety of mechanisms involved in the activation of nausea and vomiting. Serotonin, a ubiquitous central and peripheral neurotransmitter, is thought to be the predominant mediator of the perception of nausea and triggering of the vomiting response in both the brain and the periphery via the 5 -hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5 -HT 3) receptor pathways. 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists disrupt this pathway, largely at the level of the vagal afferent pathways, to decrease nausea and vomiting. This review will focus on <b>dolasetron,</b> an older but sill commonly used 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist and its multimodal mechanism of action, safety and tolerability, patient considerations, and a review of the current literature on its use to combat both chemotherapy-induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting in these two important patient populations.

The ECG presented in the figure shows the characteristic features of sodium channel blockade with a markedly widened QRS complex and a rightward shift of the terminal 40 ms of the frontal plane QRS complex vector. 2 The apparent prolongation of the QT interval (QTc 611 ms) in this type of cardiac toxicity is secondary to widenin...|$|E
