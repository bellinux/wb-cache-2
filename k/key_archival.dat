Looking at the photo, many questions raced through my mind. Upon the first round of informal questioning about the picture I realized that the photo was taken in front of an old one-room schoolhouse in the Walnut Creek area northwest of Prescott, Arizona. What makes this photo significant to my family and myself is that three of the students, Minnie, Asa, and Orville Bozarth in the photo, were my great great aunt and uncles. Further questioning about the school led me to the realization that very little was known about the school, its significance, and where it once stood. The goal of my research is to bridge the historic cultural significance of this schoolhouse on the landscape to people who are tied in a contemporary context to the area through memories of its archaeological past.

Upon retrieval, one tag each from the two vendors had malfunctioned: from these no data (NMT) or only partial data (WC) could be downloaded. An algorithm onboard the NMT tag automatically calculated geographical positions. For the WC tags, three different algorithms were used to estimate geographical positions from the recorded light intensity data. Es-timates of longitude from all tags were significantly less variable than those for latitude. The mean absolute error for longitude estimates from the NMT tags ranged from 0. 29 to 0. 35 º, and for the WC tags from 0. 13 to 0. 25 º. Th...|$|R
40|$|This article {{makes use}} {{of the most recent}} western and Japanese {{scholarship}} on pre-war Japan's consumer culture and the so-called moga (modern girls) phenomena in order to more deeply explore the consumption patterns, shopping-based lifestyles and values of Tokyo's middle and upper middle class women during {{the first decade of the}} Showa era. To these new secondary sources, the author adds a close reading of <b>key</b> <b>archival</b> photographic and film-based sources as well as new Japanese language work in the area of consumer and business history. It's goal is to examine the extent to which middle class Tokyo women had adopted western style fashions as part of a dual lifestyle or nijū seikatsu in the immediately pre-war years. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, but one that is firmly based around an analysis of documentary and photographic-based evidence, it seeks to explore the nature and meaning of the pre-war Ginza shopping experience for middle- and upper-class women. Focusing on the impact of department stores and the consumption of western-influenced clothing, makeup and accessories, it also uses five key movies featuring women living a nijū seikatsu to argue that the years 1935 - 37 marked a high point of modernity in Japanese urban culture. 　本稿では、戦前の日本の消費者文化と、モガと呼ばれる当時時代を先取りしていた女性たちの存在に着目しつつ、昭和初期の 10 年間に見られる東京の中流・上流所得層の女性たちの買物様式やライフスタイル、そして彼女たちが日本の都会文化に及ぼした影響について考察する。これら女性たちを記録した日本語文献や、彼女たちの諸相を捉えた映画やドキュメンタリー、写真等を分析することを通して、第 2 次世界大戦開戦を間近に控えた数年間に、日本文化や和装を生活に留めつつ、洋装を採り入れたこれら女性たちの所謂「二重生活」に、洋装はどの程度浸透していたのかを考察する。同時に、当時銀座で買物をするということが彼女たちのアイデンティティに及ぼした影響を掘り下げたい。さらに、「二重生活」を送る女性に取材した 5 作の映画を取り上げ、百貨店が女性のライフスタイルに及ぼした影響、ひいては、女性たちが採り入れている洋服や欧米風の化粧、装飾品に焦点を当て、日本の都会文化は 1935 年から 1937 年の 2 年間に、劇的に現代化が進んだことを明らかにしたい...|$|E

40|$|The {{first decade}} of the 21 st Century in the United States {{witnessed}} two major events that have come to be understood as national disasters: September 11, 2001 and Hurricane Katrina. Numerous historical institutions quickly mobilized to collect material relating to the two events, prompting the creation of what is now referred to as "disaster archives. " Such "disaster archives" turn a number of key tenets in the archival field on their head as they (1) immediately collect material instead of allowing substantial time to pass, (2) collect material that is in a destroyed state rather than in pristine condition, and (3) digitally collect thousands of anonymous online public responses to the two events instead of relying on experts and/or legitimate and verifiable sources. These new collection methods reveal the mechanisms of power involved in the construction of notions of race, sexuality, class, and national belonging through archival production. This dissertation analyzes the birth and implementation of these new disaster archives by tracking the development of the first two instances of disaster archiving in the United States at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History's September 11 th and Hurricane Katrina Collections, together with their partnered digital archives: the September 11 Digital Archive and the Hurricane Digital Memory Bank. Through the investigation of each archive's acquisition files, which document the merits of collecting each acquired item, coupled with interviews with <b>key</b> <b>archival</b> staff, this dissertation creates an innovative methodology - an ethnography of archives - that analyzes the complex structures of power involved in the process of archival creation. This analysis demonstrates the ways in which racialized thinking subtly, yet powerfully informs the collection process of these disaster archives, resulting in two very different renderings of national belonging. Principles of whiteness are employed to render the September 11 th victims heroic citizens, whose deaths deserve national mourning, whereas notions of Blackness, poverty, disposability, and criminality are activated to disassociate the victims of Hurricane Katrina from US national identity, granting them only distant sympathy. Such results have powerful consequences as these archives become the source of the past for future generations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{behavioral}} {{physiology of}} bigeye tuna was investigated using acoustic tags in the 1990 s. They {{spend most of}} the daylight hours below the thermocline but make regular brief excursions into the mixed layer. In doing so, they reduce the efficacy of their vascular countercurrent heat exchangers while gaining heat from the warmer environment and then increase it again when they return below the thermocline. Recently, archival tags have been used on a range of tuna species including bluefin. This tag, recovered when the tuna is har-vested, yields time-series data over longer periods than acoustic tags. Although immature Pacific bluefin {{spend most of the}}ir time at the surface, they often dive below the thermocline, maintaining a peritoneal temperature. This might be due either to heat conservation or high heat production. Further, while giant Atlantic bluefin show an ability to maintain their tem-perature above the ambient, there are occasions in cold water when some physiological process is clearly limiting their dive time. Solution of the growth conundrum that their warm body temperature may pose an ecological problem as they grow in body mass, should be clar-ified by using tag data. This will lead to investigation of their adaptation mechanisms to their habitats. <b>key</b> words: <b>archival</b> tag, tuna, thermo-physiology, acoustic tag, adaptation mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Bio-logging {{devices have}} become an {{integral}} part of many studies on the behav-ior, physiology and ecology of marine vertebrates. In the beginning, 1963, a time depth recorder (TDR) was designed to measure time and depth of freely diving Weddell seals, Leptonychotes weddellii, in the Antarctic. This was the first device used to obtain detailed information on underwater activity of an aquatic animal. It recorded data for one hour. Since that time there has been a steady evolution of this type of recorder. In 1975 a revised TDR with an extended time base of 14 days recorded the diving activity of the northern fur seal, Callorhinus ursinus. Through the rest of the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s other fur seal species, as well as Weddell seals, and leather back sea turtles were studied, and the inventive pace of the TDR quickened. In 1981 an elegant mechanical recorder that lasted for three months was deployed. The emergence of microprocessors in the 1980 ’s made possible further miniatur-ization and the logging of several additional variables. The next revolution occurred in the 1990 ’s with the inception of satellite transmitters that made it possible to determine precise-ly where an animal was on the planet, and to retrieve other data as well. This remarkable abil-ity to incorporate the measurement of spatial distribution was soon augmented by a third rev-olution, the use of mountable videocameras or camcorders on the animals themselves. With this arsenal of bio-logging devices many questions about aquatic animals are being resolved that were only dreams for the first generation of biologists studying the marine activities of vertebrates. <b>key</b> words: <b>archival</b> recorder, bio-logger, camcorder, TDR, PT...|$|R
40|$|The soul has ears": Music and Movement in the Poetry of John Berryman Berryman?s musical {{interest}} is consistently remarked on by readers of his work, but remains vastly understudied, though it touches almost {{every aspect of}} his poetic project. The poet?s obsession with ?hearing? was one that spilled across from one art form into another, and his musical enthusiasm expresses itself {{in a way that is}} all-pervasive. Berryman?s work represents a deep enquiry into the influence of music on the mind and body, as well as its impact on the structures of the poem. As early as The Dispossessed (1948), his first major publication, the song emerges as an emotional yet social medium, and the poet?s interest in the human voice as a form of musical embodiment remains a feature until his final posthumous collection, Delusions, Etc., published in 1972. In fact, all of Berryman?s major poetic works demonstrate a general, and associated, interest in musical personalities ? such as Beethoven, Bach, and Bessie Smith ? particularly those whose experience Berryman felt most resonated with his own. Various musical traditions collide energetically within his work (most famously in The Dream Songs [1969]), and his thematic preoccupations often mark the site of deeper structural engagement. In many of these published works, though particularly Berryman?s Sonnets (1967), there is a further enquiry into the relationship between word and music and an examination of the musical integrity of language per se. Berryman?s musical explorations touch on almost all of his central themes: love, loss and the ability of artistic form to shape to human experience. Across his work, the poet uses music to express both personal and political traumas, and often through it he discovers a means of transcendence. Moreover, Berryman?s sense of memory, terminality and creative legacy emerges consistently in connection with music, themes that take precedence in his final two collections, Love & Fame (1970) and Delusions, Etc. (1972). Reading Berryman?s major books in chronological order, this study demonstrates how music enters the poetry and comes to shape the trajectory of his career. Indeed, as <b>key</b> <b>archival</b> findings show, some of the most notable developments in Berryman?s poetry can be understood as having their basis in his musical thinking, which allowed the poet to step outside his own discipline and enter into a broader creative continuum...|$|E
40|$|This guide {{has been}} {{produced}} {{to commemorate the}} centenary of the Commonwealth Government 2 ̆ 7 s acquisition of the Northern Territory from South Australia. The Commonwealth assumed responsibility for {{the administration of the}} Northern Territory from 1 January 1911. Its administration ended with the granting of self-government on 1 July 1978, although, for particular functions, the Commonwealth still maintains a strong presence in the Territory. The guide 2 ̆ 7 s prime focus is the Commonwealth 2 ̆ 7 s period of administration (often referred to as 2 ̆ 7 the Commonwealth era 2 ̆ 7), although it does begin with a chapter on the South Australian period from 1863 to 1911 (see chapter 1), and there is selected coverage of Territory issues and events after 1978. The chapters in the guide focus on specific periods and events during the Commonwealth era and use them as a means to present and describe the <b>key</b> <b>archival</b> collections that are available. The guide does not claim to be exhaustive: it does not seek to include every record associated with the Northern Territory. Importantly, it does aim to educate and inform, and to highlight many areas of further research.   The majority of records listed in the guide are in the custody of the National Archives of Australia – mainly held by the Canberra and Darwin offices. Also listed in this guide are records in the Northern Territory Archives Service, located in Darwin, and some in other institutions, including State Records of South Australia, the archival authority for the South Australian Government; the National Library of Australia; and the Australian War Memorial. After the Northern Territory achieved self-government in 1978, a number of administrative functions – including local services, lands and mining – passed from the Commonwealth to the Northern Territory Government. The records dealing with those functions, which had previously been in the custody of the National Archives, were transferred to the Northern Territory Archives Service. This occurred in accordance with the fundamental archival principle that 2 ̆ 7 records follow function 2 ̆ 7, that is, if a particular administrative function moves from one level of government to another, the records dealing with that function are also relocated. Archives of the Northern Territory are sometimes fragmentary. There are several reasons for this – first, the harshness of the tropical climate, which has been a distinct deterrence to long-term preservation of records. Second, the bombing of Darwin in February 1942, with the subsequent evacuation of civilian administration to Alice Springs and the imposition of Australian military administration in the 2 ̆ 7 Top End 2 ̆ 7 for the duration of World War II. Third, there was the destruction of Darwin caused by Cyclone Tracy in 1974. Nevertheless, substantial quantities of records are available for research, both in Darwin and Canberra.    ...|$|E
40|$|All {{over the}} world {{migrants}} have influenced and changed the cultures of the countries where they have settled, and they have built new communities that have retained connections, to differing degrees and by various means, with their original homelands. The multiple traces that they have left in official and unofficial documents potentially provide a rich resource for supporting and celebrating {{a sense of identity}} within such communities and for capturing and maintaining their histories. The gathering and preservation of these histories are also fundamentally important for enabling research on immigrant cultural heritage and thereby contributing to deeper understanding of cross-cultural and multicultural issues in an era of unprecedented global movement of people away from their homelands. In the case of migrants, collecting information that can provide relevant data is {{complicated by the fact that}} at least two countries are involved, with different laws, policies and conventions for data storage and access, and also in most cases, different languages. In this project between two countries, via close collaboration the Digital Humanities Research Group at the University of Western Sydney, Curtin University and the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands in The Hague, sets up processes for overcoming barriers such as these that have stood in the way of cross-national research on migrant lives in the past. The importance of cultural heritage to national economies and social capital is widely recognised. In 2014 the Council of the European Union adopted the ‘Conclusions on Cultural Heritage’ confirming cultural heritage as ‘a strategic resource for a sustainable Europe’. The ‘Conclusions’ recognised the role of participatory governance in ‘triggering new opportunities brought by globalisation, digitisation and new technologies which are changing the way cultural heritage is created, accessed and used’. [* 1]It is these new opportunities that this ‘Migration, Mobility and Connection’ project responds to. Documents and evidence of the history of migration are spread very widely, and in most cases have been almost entirely inaccessible for research purposes in the past in Australia. This project is a study on Dutch-Australian mutual cultural heritage. Its aim is to begin the process of finding, assembling and organising into accessible and searchable formats, information in selected <b>key</b> <b>archival</b> records, in both Australia and The Netherlands, relating to Dutch emigration to Australia. The project is conceptualised as a pilot that addresses difficulties faced by transnational collaboration of this kind and proposes ways of overcoming them. It will work through archival and custodial challenges in the discovery, collection, preservation and content management of traces from the past and propose new digital approaches that may lead to solutions. While the initial focus will be on migration, in the context of the maritime and mercantile history that the Netherlands shares with Australia, the project aims to establish a model that can be utilised for further Netherlands–Australian mutual heritage work and, potentially, for other immigrant groups. Joint activity is underway to design a database for the project that integrates data in Australia with data in The Netherlands. Three digitised datasets contain representations of migrant travels: (a) Netherlands database (registration cards); (b) National Archives of Australia database (casefiles from several series); and (c) Nominal rolls / ships’ passenger lists (representing a high percentage of digitisation in the National Archives of Australia). Items (a) and (b) are to be used for the data backbone; item (c) can be used for a more geographic visualisation (migrant mobility between the Netherlands and Australia and vice versa) and enrichment of the data backbone. The three datasets are different sources of information about the same people and voyages; they can therefore be used to determine where each of them has structural gaps (if any) and make it possible to produce a more detailed estimate of the numbers of people that migrated and the way they travelled...|$|E

Research finds a strong, {{positive relationship between}} good quality housing and health, and this paper assesses the impact and living experience of housing of older people in rural Thailand.

This was a mixed-method study, using data from observations of the physical adequacy of housing, semistructured interviews with <b>key</b> informants, and <b>archival</b> information from health records for 13 households in rural Thailand. Results. There were four main themes, each of which led to health risks for the older people: “lighting and unsafe wires,” “house design and composition,” “maintenance of the house,” and “health care equipment. ” The housing was not appropriately designed to accommodate health care equipment or to fully support individual daily activities of older people. Numerous accidents occurred {{as a direct result}} of inadequate housing and the majority of houses had insufficient and unsafe lighting, floor surfaces and furniture that created health risks, and toilets or beds that were at an unsuitable height for older people.

40|$|Museum {{buildings}} have clear behavioral functions; {{they also have}} symbolic functions, to express the privileged space and valuable objects they contain. This research looks closely at a recently-completed museum building in Denver, Colorado. Located in a regional city {{in the middle of}} the United States, the Denver Art Museum explicitly wanted to replicate the success of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao with its new wing. This case study utilizes a multi-method approach, with findings based on interviews with <b>key</b> stakeholders, <b>archival</b> data, and direct observations of the building and the spaces it creates. From the beginning, the Hamilton Building had functions to fulfill beyond preserving and displaying art: it was to be its own fundraising tool, to represent Denver to the world and the Museum to Denver residents, and to draw cultural tourists in the same way that the Guggenheim museum drew tourists to Bilbao. As such, with a bond approved by the voters, the selection committee hired Daniel Libeskind as the primary architect, based on his personality, political savvy, and exuberant conceptual design. The form of the building fulfills the programmatic requirements of the bond, while simultaneously fulfilling more symbolic functions. Its image is used as one of six in an international marketing campaign to boost tourism to Denver. The building is written about in the local, national, and international press, and while not all comments are positive, it does draw attention to Denver. The irregular spaces for art push curators and exhibition designers to be creative in how art is displayed, even changing art display tactics in the older, square-walled building. Artists generally like creating art specifically for the space, and one of the most successful shows in the building allowed visitors to watch art getting created and installed [...] an idea that was completely new to the Museum. In conclusion, a new museum type has emerged, one where the building is as important as the art. This building type serves as a fundraising and advertising tool, not only the museum but also the city...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} key actors in an organisation and informal professional networks. It uses pragmatic constructivism (PC) as a research paradigm together with concepts borrowed from the theory of social networks to investigate how these actors responded to {{a particular set of}} non-financial performance targets. Design/methodology/approach: The implementation process of waiting time targets in the Accident and Emergency Department was observed as part of an in-depth study at a large English National Health Service hospital. The main sources of data were face-to-face interviews with <b>key</b> actors, documentary <b>archival</b> evidence and observation diaries. Findings: The results indicated that with the effect of information sharing through these networks, implementation methodology switched from systems approach to actors approach. Professional connections between key actors had allowed them to generate their own understanding in responding to new performance measures. As a consequence, the perceptions of other actors in relevant networks, as well as the implementation practices were influenced. Research limitations/implications: This is a single-site, in-depth case study; hence, the findings are not generalizable. Practical implications: This study demonstrated just how influential some key actors can be in shaping the implementation of performance measures. Originality/value: The paper contributes to PC by providing evidence on the influence of informal professional networks and structural holes in shaping organisational topos...|$|R
40|$|Koncepti provenijencije i izvornog reda imaju ključnu ulogu u arhivskoj teoriji i praksi još od njihova oblikovanja i kodifikacije u devetnaestom stoljeću. Preuzeti iz u to vrijeme dominantne metodologije i filozofije povijesti i uvedeni kao odgovor na neuspjeh drugih metoda za organizaciju i obradu gradiva u tadašnjim arhivima – koji su se u sve većoj mjeri suočavali s pritiskom sve većih količina gradiva različite tipologije – postali su i ključni pojmovi arhivske teorije. Uz različite modifikacije ostali su to i do danas, unatoč brojnim uvidima u ograničenost i uvjetovanost njihove primjene i osporavanjima njihovih tradicionalnih formulacija. Takva osporavanja u određenoj su mjeri relativizirala njihov status, no nisu vodila i zamjeni tog koncepta arhiva nekim drugim pristupima. Umjesto toga, kritičke primjedbe uglavnom su preoblikovane u nove formulacije starih načela, završavajući u vrlo širokom i difuznom pojmu konteksta koji je danas u opticaju i u kojem je sve manje jasna granica koja arhivski dokument dijeli od bilo kojeg drugog teksta ili bilo koje druge stvari čije se značenje traži u kontekstualizaciji njezina nastajanja. U radu se ispituju uvjeti u kojima su navedena načela stekla takav utemeljiteljski status u arhivskoj struci i njihova otpornost na ne baš neuvjerljiva dovođenja u pitanje takvog statusa, naročito u novije vrijeme, u arhivistici obilježeno razmjerno kasnim utjecajem postmodernih koncepata na koncept arhiva kao legitimatora istinitih tvrdnji o prošloj stvarnosti. Otvaranje tradicionalno zatvorenog arhivističkog diskursa utjecajima tematizacija pojma arhiva u drugim disciplinama doprinijelo je dekonstrukciji ideološkog supstrata na koji se prešutno pozivaju tradicionalne formulacije arhivističkih načela, no ujedno i preformulaciji načela na način koji tom supstratu omogućuje da ostane gdje je bio. Ova otpornost na kritiku načela tumači se stavom da su provenijencija i izvornost ono što se traži od arhiva, a ne nužno i njegova izvorna obilježja. U radu se posebno istražuje utjecaj tradicionalnih arhivističkih načela na opis, obradu i vrednovanje arhivskog gradiva, kao istaknute funkcije arhiva, te način na koji ona uvjetuju i ograničavaju metode vrednovanja i opisa arhivskog gradiva.

Concepts of provenance {{and original}} order {{play a key}} role in archival theory and practice since their formation and codification in the nineteenth century. Taken from, at that time, the dominant methodology and philosophy of historical research, and introduced into archival practice as a response to the failure of other methods for organizing and processing materials in archival institutions of that time – increasingly faced with the pressure of amounts of materials of different provenances and types – provenance and original order have become the key concepts of archive theory. They kept that status until now, although modified since then in various ways, despite of a number of insights demonstrating their limits and very conditioned possibilities of implementation in their traditional formulations. Their status has been relativized to some extent, but this process hasn’t offered new concepts. Instead, the criticism is mostly converted into new formulations of old principles, ending in a very broad and diffuse concept of the context, which is now very popular substitute to the old terms, and which makes the boundary separating the archival documents from any other kind of text less secure. The new formulation of the <b>key</b> <b>archival</b> concepts simply states that the meaning of archives, just as the meaning of anything else, depends of the context, be it the context of creation of records or a more inclusive definition of the context. This research tries to examine conditions that enabled those principles to acquire status of founding principles of the archival science, and to see what made them resistant to many convincing analyses of their limited applicability and incapacity to describe accurately the very concept of the archive. In last three decades the concept of the archive was exposed to postmodern questioning about its nature and, especially, about its claim to be the primary place for legitimation of the truth claims about the reality of the past. The opening of the archival discourse - traditionally closed to the influences from abroad - to the influences from other disciplines, has contributed to the deconstruction of ideological substrate of the old principles. It also contributed to the reformulation of the principles, but in a way that allows that substrate to remain where it was. This resistance of the principles to criticism is explained as a consequence of the fact that they are something that is required from the archive, desirable and forced effect of the archive, not its intrinsic feature. To test this hypothesis, this research examines the history of ideas about archives since the sixteenth century to the present, with two goals: to identify concepts of the archive, if any, that doesn’t depend on the principle of provenance and the ‘ideology of trace’, which seems to be the force behind the principles, and, second, to analyze historical roots and interpretations of the principles, in order to identify the background which infuses the principles with power again and again, despite all criticism. The analysis starts with Jacob von Rammingen and his elaborated explication of the archive and its role in the society. His concept of the archive proved to be deeply rooted in a political ideology of that time, and a concept of the society which justified that ideology. Based on that interpretative framework, he conceived the archive as a tool for political action, to be used by its owner to achieve common social benefits, peace and stability in the society. This concept of the archive didn’t need any other founding principle, like principle of provenance, because records were not considered to be primary traces of the past, and their meaning was secured by the framing ideology. In the pre-romantic period other concepts of ‘non-principle-of-provenance’ archive are also identified, such as Bonifacio’s one, which posits the archive in the framework of humanistic vision of the man and its development. Other kinds of the archival concepts, where the principle of provenance seems to be ineffective, for other reasons, are found in contemporary experiments with the archive in the arts. Unlike pre-romantic concepts of the archive, free of the ideology of trace, these new concept suffer from the ineffectiveness of the promising principle of provenance, which can be illustrated by the struggle of artist, like Boltanski, with the impossibility to archive their works or lives in the ‘original’ state or meaning. It is argued that this difference originates from a void place uncovered by removing effectiveness of the ideology of trace from the archive, without replacing it with any other legitimating concept or ideology. Traditional archival principles of provenance and original order originate from romantic philosophy of history and its concepts of the individual historical development of human communities, above all of nations. This concept of history has placed the truth of human essence and meaning in the past: individual, idiosyncratic, and legitimizing past, proper to every single community, and unrepeatable. The source of the truth was historicized, and this is the place where the ideology of trace got its power. On this basis, hermeneutic methodology of historical research has been developed in the first half of nineteenth century, and subsequently transformed into theoretical basis of the initially pragmatic archival principle of provenance. The origin of the principle still resonates in its newer reformulations, be it functional or societal provenance, or simply context, referencing the source of the truth in the individuality of legitimizing past. This analysis of the principles served in this research also to evaluate effects of the application of principles in two basic fields of archival practice: processing of the archival material and archival appraisal. The concept of fonds, initially mainly a pragmatic solution to the problem of dealing with heterogeneous material being accumulated in the centralized archival repositories, was - under the influence of theoretical aspects of the principle - upgraded to the status of a true representation of its creator and his historical significance. Accordingly, finding aids were increasingly seen as representations of fonds as true representations of the past. Such approach entered, subsequently, the archival deontology, and influenced development of archival information systems and rather late standardization of descriptive practice. As to the appraisal, the influence of principles of provenance and original order can be seen in a negative approach, which has dominated in discussions about this topic until the second half of the twentieth century, in the inability to define broadly acceptable positive selection criteria, distrust in any outer source of values, such as supposed users’ needs or common societal values, and in differing opinions about validity of some newer approaches to the appraisal, such as documentation strategies, participatory appraisal, or appraisal in a way of archival activism...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposal}} {{to develop a}} new city at Monarto in South Australia during the 1970 s was an important project of the reforming government of Don Dunstan. Dunstan’s view was that Monarto would be a city environmentally suited to the tough conditions of its site, and to an ‘Australian way of life’. As planning and preliminary design proceeded from 1972 to 1975, the landscape potential of the city’s selected site became central to its conception. This paper draws on new research comprising interviews with <b>key</b> participants and <b>archival</b> material to examine four issues: the adoption of an environmental orientation in Australian urban planning and discourse in the 1970 s; strategies in the design proposals that seemingly gave Monarto validity even as the demographic and political drivers for it dissolved away; the investigations that supported Monarto’s landscape strategies; and attitudes to social and cultural history that the Monarto project adopted. While ultimately the plan for Monarto was abandoned, the projected city’s landscape {{can be seen as a}} theatre for competing values in relation to natural and cultural heritage and design ambitions. The paper situates Monarto within national and international urban discourse that is more complex than has been previously acknowledged, indicative of competing values and ideologies in the planning, landscape and design discourses of the period...|$|R
40|$|Places of Publication is a {{sustained}} {{study of the}} practice of Angus & Robertson’s London office as publishers and exporters / importers, using a mixed-methods approach combining the statistical analysis of bibliographic data with an interpretative history of primary resource materials. Although this thesis is the fourth to interrogate the extensive Mitchell Library holdings of the Angus & Robertson archives, it is the first whose central concern is the company’s production and distribution of Australian titles within the United Kingdom and further afield through its London office. Often indicated as worthy of further investigation, this is an area of history which to date has only been broadly scoped without reference to <b>key</b> (often restricted) <b>archival</b> volumes. Exploring the premise that there are cultural and commercial links between books produced at home and books imported from overseas, this study examines whether an Australian publisher could avoid becoming subject to the same socio-economic forces that British publishers claimed underpinned their international trade. Indeed, within the historical context of a strong British presence in Australian publishing and bookselling across the course of the twentieth century, this thesis asks in what ways did Angus & Robertson replicate, challenge or transform the often highly-criticised commercial practices of British publishers in order to develop an export trade for Australian books in the United Kingdom...|$|R

Background. Over the last decade, Thailand has experienced an aging population, especially in rural areas. Research finds a strong, positive relationship between good quality housing and health, and this paper assesses the impact and living experience of housing of older people in ruralThailand. Methods. This was a mixed-method study, using data from observations of the physical adequacy of housing, semistructured interviews with <b>key</b> informants, and <b>archival</b> information from health records for 13 households in rural Thailand. Results. There were four main themes, each of which led to health risks for the older people: “lighting and unsafe wires,” “house design and composition, ” “maintenance of the house, ” and “health care equipment. ” The housing was not appropriately designed to accommodate health care equipment or to fully support individual daily activities of older people. Numerous accidents occurred {{as a direct result}} of inadequate housing and the majority of houses had insufficient and unsafe lighting, floor surfaces and furniture that created health risks, and toilets or beds that were at an unsuitable height for older people. Conclusion. This paper provides an improved and an important understanding of the housing situation among older people living in rural areas inThailand. 1...|$|R

This study applies analytical tools from international relations research {{to explain the}} formation of international health regimes. The study utilizes two explanatory perspectives: individual leadership, {{and the interests of}} key non-state actors in the formation process, using the case of the formation of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) from 1995 to 1999. The case study is based on material from interviews with <b>key</b> actors, an <b>archival</b> review of documents from the Children's Vaccine Initiative (CVI), and published literature. Findings show that the regime formation process was initiated by individuals who were primarily affiliated to scientific communities and who led to the World Bank and the Gates Foundation becoming champions of a new coordinating mechanism for new vaccine introduction. Negotiations in the regime formation process were between a small group of founding agencies with divergent interests regarding immunization priorities. The case also sheds light on the authority of the WHO and the resources of the Gates Foundation in driving the process towards the final structure of the alliance. The paper discusses the potential contribution of the international relations approach compared to policy research as a way of understanding the institutional dynamics of global health, particularly in respect of relations between countries and non-state actors.

40|$|This thesis uses an empirically {{informed}} Marxist {{analysis to}} investigate the role of interests, consciousness and unpaid activity of refugees and asylum seekers in shaping their relationships with the British state, including case studies {{from the city of}} Newcastle upon Tyne. I argue that antagonism between the British state and refugees from economically underdeveloped countries is rooted in capitalist relations of production, with Britain occupying an imperialist position. The thesis advances a novel perspective on ‘social capital’, understood as purposive and sustained forms of non-contractual engagement, with implicit norms and values. Social capital is ‘unmasked’ as a way of understanding and intervening in relations at an individual level, in order to influence change at a social level. I argue that the tendency of recent Labour governments’ policy has been to break up social capital formations among refugees which are seen as threatening, whilst actively cultivating formations which engage refugees on an individual basis, as part of managing their oppression. The thesis identifies contradictions and possibilities for resistance within this process, such as simultaneous tendencies for volunteering to contribute to more collective forms of identity and more individualised forms of action. The multi-level research design explores processes connecting the individual to the global. Empirical data is used to interrogate and develop a theoretical framework which is rooted in classical Marxism, draws on insights developed within qualitative social research methods and anti-oppressive practice, and engages creatively with challenges from post-modernism and feminism. The methodology combines: theoretical research; secondary statistics and literature at an international level; interviews with <b>key</b> participants and <b>archival</b> research on local histories of migration and settlement, including three organisational case studies; four contemporary organisational case studies; and individual volunteer case studies based on semi-structured interviews and focus groups with eighteen refugees and asylum seekers.

40|$|The {{past two}} decades have {{witnessed}} {{the rapid growth of}} China’s outward foreign direct investment (FDI) and the rise of Chinese multinational enterprises (MNEs). Given the pace with which China’s go-global policy is unfolding, how Chinese MNEs should balance global integration and local responsiveness and choose an international business strategy (IBS) have become challenging issues for these emerging firms. Appreciating the need for MNEs to be both globally integrated and locally responsive, researchers have developed a global integration and local responsiveness framework (the I-R framework), and identified four basic international business strategies (IBSs), namely, international, multi-domestic, global and transnational. Within the extant literature, global integration and local responsiveness are general concepts that mean many things to different observers though scholars continue both to seek underlying factors and determine their relative significance. However, these studies mainly focus on MNEs from advanced economies and/or their subsidiaries in emerging markets and tend to be based on quantitative methodologies. This concentration leaves open the question of the relevance of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) centred findings to MNEs from emerging markets and their subsidiaries in advanced economies. Given this situation, the thesis raises three primary research questions: (1) What factors influence the I-R framework in the context of Chinese MNEs? (2) How do underlying factors induce a preference for either global integration or local responsiveness in the context of Chinese MNEs? (3) How do Chinese MNEs’ preferences between global integration and local responsiveness influence their selection of IBSs? To address the three research questions, nine Chinese MNEs that have invested in Australia were selected for detailed investigation. The nine case studies were examined at both headquarters and Australian subsidiary levels. Perception analysis and cross-case synthesis were employed as major data processing techniques and triangulation was achieved by utilizing three means of data collection: in-depth interviews with <b>key</b> informants; <b>archival</b> analysis; and observation. The contributions made by this thesis include: (1) the examination of thirty-six underlying factors identified as significant by the literature and the identification of three new factors that influence the I-R framework in the context of Chinese MNEs; (2) Bartlett and Ghoshal’s theory of IBS choice is extended by showing the value of applying the theory to MNEs from emergent economies; and (3) it is shown that a contingency perspective can assist MNEs to reconcile forces for global integration and local responsiveness. The study holds that what constitutes a relevant IBS for an MNE depends on how the firm reconciles the need to be both globally integrated and locally responsive and that this issue requires the balancing of three aspects of contingencies, namely, organizational, industrial and environmental. Finally, the research limitations and suggestions for future research are identified and presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCase {{studies of}} social-ecological landscapes that {{consider}} local, spatially explicit land cover changes {{are necessary for}} the development of generalised knowledge on deforestation. This study focussed on two indigenous territories of eastern Panama that share the same settlement history, size and location but are perceived by local dwellers to differ in terms of land cover. By considering the territories social-ecological systems made up of Resource Systems, Resource Units, Actors and Governance Structures, following Ostrom’s framework for analysing the sustainability of social-ecological systems (McGinnis and Ostrom, 2014), we sought to determine which social-ecological factors could have led to divergent land cover outcomes to address local leaders’ concerns and inform future land management strategies. We conducted quantitative, spatial analysis using ArcGIS and multivariate statistics from numerical ecology on land cover data from participatory maps, and household level socio-economic data from semi-structured interviews and surveys. Results illustrate that the Resource System’s topography and Actors’ socioeconomics, namely number of people at home and household land ownership, are constraining variables on land cover and help explain divergent forest cover. To reconstruct the influence of history and Governance Structure on the landscapes, we conducted qualitative data collection, namely participatory pebble scoring of historical land cover, interviews with <b>key</b> informants, an <b>archival</b> search, and creation of a participatory historical timeline. Historical governmental timber extraction in the region pre-settlement, guided by topography constraints, may have led to degraded Resource Units (forests) susceptible to clearing. The Governance Structure’s self-organizing, monitoring and networking activities with outside institutions in scientific projects, enabled by Actors’ leadership and social capital, likely encouraged forest conservation in the forest-rich territory. Future land management could therefore benefit from establishment of a local non-governmental organisation to coordinate a communal vision of management and harness external conservation resources. Our findings suggest that inputting both qualitative and quantitative data obtained by participatory methods into Ostrom’s framework can help diagnose territories with divergent landscapes, and thereby inform both forest conservation science and local land management...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the Zero Waste {{movement}} {{has emerged as}} a "visionary" approach to sustainable consumption and production. Promoting the transition from the linear system of 'take-make-dispose' to a closed-loop system where materials are reused continuously, Zero Waste advocates aim to conserve resources, protect health through material recovery, and improve the equity of material distribution. While the philosophy of Zero Waste is often commended for its comprehensive consideration of the environmental, social, and economic factors of waste, the movement has largely relied on a single indicator [...] diversion rate [...] to measure and guide progress. Diversion rates quantify the percentage of materials diverted from landfills or incinerators. For Zero Waste advocates, the goal is 90 - 100 percent diversion, which implies a very closed loop of material recovery. However, the term 'diversion' often describes a range of activities, such as reuse, recycling, and composting without any indication of whether materials are being diverted temporarily or indefinitely. This thesis uses a comparative case analysis to determine the strengths and limitations of the diversion rate as the primary performance indicator for Zero Waste in the management of municipal solid waste. Using semi-structured interviews with <b>key</b> informants and <b>archival</b> documents, the report compares Los Angeles and New York City, two cities that established diversion rate mandates more than 25 years ago and recently adopted Zero Waste goals. By analyzing the development of diversion activities in these two locations, the thesis establishes the need for more holistic evaluative methods and proposes upstream strategies to help municipalities transition to a sustainable, closed loop system. by Jennifer M.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to use the concept of ‘mediatization’ to inform a critical, {{grounded}} and fine-grained empirical analysis of the institutional dynamics that operate at the interface between government and the media in a liberal democracy. This thesis applies a novel theoretical and empirical approach to the familiar narrative of ‘political spin’, challenging the common assumption that government communications is either a neutral professional function, or an inherently unethical form of distorted communication. In May 1997, Labour came into power on a landslide, bringing into government its 24 / 7 strategic communications operation, determined to neutralise what it saw as the default right-wing bias of the national media. In the process, the rules of engagement between government and the media were transformed, undermining the resilience of government communications and unleashing a wave of resistance and response. Much academic attention to date has focused on party political news management, while the larger but less visible civil service media operation remains relatively un-examined and undertheorised, although some northern European scholars are exploring mediatization from within public bureaucracies. This study takes a qualitative approach to analyzing change between 1997 and 2014, through 16 in-depth interviews with former, largely middle-ranking, departmental government communicators, most of whom had performed media relations roles. This was a group of civil servants that had spent their working lives in close proximity to ministers during a time of rapidly increasing media scrutiny. These witness accounts were augmented by interviews with six journalists and three politically-appointed special advisers, together with a systematic analysis of <b>key</b> contemporary and <b>archival</b> documents. The aim was to provide insights into change over time within a shared policy and representational space that is theorised here as the ‘cross-field’, where media act as a catalyst for the concentration of political power.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} explores {{transformation of}} South African National Parks (SANParks), from 1991 to 2008. SANParks organizational “battles also changed” with transition to democracy, {{which resulted in}} major political and institutional changes in South Africa. Based on a single case study, with a longitudinal dimension (study period, 1991 - 2008), the dissertation examines SANParks transformation through multi-disciplinary lens, and analyzes transformation strategies and initiatives related to de-racialization, black empowerment, social justice, and people-oriented conservation. <b>Key</b> informant interviews, <b>archival</b> research (documents), observational methods, and official SANParks’ organizational climate survey data set provide the data. Confronted with increasing pressure to address the apartheid legacy, SANParks responded by reforming and advancing broader objectives of “transformation” {{in an effort to}} be legitimate and survive in the new South Africa. The dissertation argues that in the context of broader transformations, political and major policy changes, SANParks’ initiatives were predicated on “enlightened pragmatism” and recognition that its organizational interests are secured through local socio-economic development and advancement of black empowerment. SANParks executives acknowledged that populist demands and societal expectations of the role and functions of national parks had to be tempered by moderation and pragmatism while transcending narrow conservation interests. In the process, SANParks was compelled by pragmatic reasons and “enlightened self-interests” to advance socio-economic initiatives that focus on historically disadvantaged communities living adjacent to national parks. It therefore focused its attention on aligning organizational interests with broader goals of transformation, black empowerment, and local socio-economic development in South Africa while keeping a big part of its conservation agenda and structure more or less intact. SANParks leaders’ transcended the impasse between the narrow conservation mandate and social issues by balancing strategic objectives against situational contingencies. Such “enlightened pragmatism” enabled SANParks to mobilize resources and socio-political support for transformation initiatives. The dissertation highlights pragmatism and relativity of transformational choices, strategic policies and approaches that influenced the trajectory of SANParks transformation, which was informed by conditions on the ground - powerful ideational, political, institutional, and economic forces...|$|R
40|$|Through a {{grounded}} theory methodology data collection around early childhood experiences with nature leading towards positive civic {{engagement with the}} community, the theory of cultural entropy emerged along with a policy recommendation for reconnecting the community to the local watershed. Through qualitative interviews with lifelong residents and analysis of essays from local high school students comparing early experiences with nature, the theory of cultural entropy emerged to explain how perceptions and interactions with the local landscape changed across generations. With the help of <b>key</b> information interviews, <b>archival</b> research, and exploration of the local watershed, cultural entropy was used to theorize how the work culture should do towards protecting and passing along ecological, cultural, and historical knowledge that might help increase civic engagement. Lifelong residents participating in the research {{were found to have}} high levels of civic engagement through participation with the local historical society and/or recommendations from people because of their involvement with the community. More than any other theme, the importance of the Arroyo Grande Creek emerged as a significantly early experience in nature amongst all lifelong residents. In contrast, this experience was completely gone from the early experiences by the high school students participating in this study. Creation of the dam, channelization of the creek, and invasive species introduction have almost eliminated access to the creek, and invasive species introduction have almost eliminated access to the creek. Very little evidence was found along the entire stretch of creek from dam to ocean of kids playing in the creek. This is theorized to be a product of larger cultures from outside this local ecosystem diffusing into the local culture, creating disconnect from local ecosystem knowledge. A policy recommendation is to create an interpretive greenbelt system along an already existing dirt farm road controlled by local agricultural land, promoting community engagement with the local watershed. Because so much of the key ecological, historical, and cultural knowledge of the area centers around the watershed, it is hypothesized that a greenbelt system has potential for reversing cultural entropy, increasing ecological, historical, and cultural knowledge of the area, and promoting civic engagement...|$|R
