To the contrary, the Agency severely criticized me when <b>I</b> <b>admitted</b> {{to the press}} that the FDN had regularly kidnapped and executed agrarian reform workers and civilians.

[...] He also agreed that his decision to take marijuana was “stupid” and “wrong.” Bush believes each state should be allowed to decide whether it is appropriate to legalize marijuana or not.|$|E

We were seated {{across from each}} other at a dinner table. We were all telling sea stories and I started telling them my story (I had forgotten that it was Commander Carpenter who had issued the orders to the wheel). Right {{in the middle of my}} story Carpenter looked at me and said, [...] "And do you know who issued those orders?" [...] When <b>I</b> <b>admitted</b> that I didn't remember, but wished that I could, he replies, [...] "I did." [...] The minute he said that, I remembered.|$|E

No. So, as far as my {{conscience}} and my mission were concerned, there was no problem. This needs to be clarified...My experience was the same as that of my movement. We were new and inexperienced and events kept occurring one after the other which we had to deal with. In doing that, we made mistakes as I told you. I admit it now and <b>I</b> <b>admitted</b> it in the notes I have written. Whoever wishes to blame or attack me is entitled to do so. I regret I didn't have enough experience to totally control the movement. On the other hand, with our constant struggle, this had to be done together with others in the communist world to stop Kampuchea becoming Vietnamese. For the love of the nation and the people it was the right thing to do but in the course of our actions we made mistakes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{family had}} a castle on the island from an early date. Sir Robert de Lawedre is {{mentioned}} by Blind Harry in The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace as a compatriot of William Wallace, and Alexander Nisbet recorded his tombstone in 1718, in {{the floor of the}} old kirk in North Berwick: [...] "here lies Sir Robert de Lawedre, great laird of the Bass, who died May 1311". Five years later his son received that part of the island which until then had been retained by The Church because it contained the holy cell of Saint Baldred. A century on Wyntown's Cronykil relates: [...] "In 1406 King Robert III, apprehensive of danger to his son James (afterwards James I) from the Duke of Albany, placed the youthful prince in the safe-custody of Sir Robert Lauder in his secure castle on the Bass prior to an embarkation for safer parts on the continent." [...] Subsequently, says Tytler, [...] "Sir Robert Lauder of the Bass {{was one of the few}} people whom King James <b>I</b> <b>admitted</b> to his confidence." [...] In 1424 Sir Robert Lauder of the Bass, with 18 men, had a safe conduct with a host of other noblemen, as a hostage for James I at Durham. J J Reid also mentions that [...] "in 1424 when King James I returned from his long captivity in England, he at once consigned to the castle of the Bass, Walter Stewart, the eldest son of Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany, his cousin. The person who received the payments for the prisoner's support was Sir Robert Lauder", whom Tytler further describes as [...] "a firm friend of the King".|$|E
