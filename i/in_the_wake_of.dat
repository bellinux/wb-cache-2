5|$|By 11 January, the Apache Corporation began {{evacuating}} all non-essential {{personnel from}} oil rigs {{in the path}} of the storm. The Rio Tinto Group shut down iron exports at its Dampier and Cape Lambert ports due to rough seas. Across the Pilbara region, the State Emergency Service advised residents to secure loose objects and ensure their emergency kits were stocked. Incident management teams were also established to help people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wake</b> <b>of</b> the storm. Additionally, urban search and rescue equipment was set up in Karratha.
