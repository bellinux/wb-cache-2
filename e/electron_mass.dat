25|$|For positronium, {{the formula}} uses the reduced mass also, {{but in this}} case, it is exactly the <b>{{electron}}</b> <b>mass</b> divided by 2. For any value of the radius, the electron and the positron are each moving at half the speed around their common center of mass, and each has only one fourth the kinetic energy.

25|$|Starting in 1908, while a {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, Millikan worked on an oil-drop experiment in which he measured the charge on a single electron. J. J. Thomson had already discovered the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron. However, the actual charge and mass values were unknown. Therefore, if one of these two values were to be discovered, the other could easily be calculated. Millikan and his then graduate student Harvey Fletcher used the oil-drop experiment to measure the charge of the electron (as well as the <b>electron</b> <b>mass,</b> and Avogadro's number, since their relation to the electron charge was known).|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} factor that distinguishes different radiation types {{from one another}} is the linear energy transfer (LET), which is {{the rate at which}} the radiation loses energy with distance traveled through the absorber. Low LET species are usually low mass, either photons or <b>electron</b> <b>mass</b> species (β particles, positrons) and interact sparsely along their path through the absorber, leading to isolated regions of reactive radical species. High LET species are usually greater in mass than one electron, for example α particles, and lose energy rapidly resulting in a cluster of ionisation events in close proximity to one another. Consequently, the heavy particle travels a relatively short distance from its origin.|$|E
25|$|For some nuclei, {{the process}} occurs as {{conversion}} of two protons to neutrons, emitting two electron neutrinos and absorbing two orbital electrons (double electron capture). If the mass {{difference between the}} parent and daughter atoms is more than 1.022MeV/c2 (two <b>electron</b> <b>masses),</b> another decay is accessible, capture of one orbital electron and emission of one positron. When the mass difference is more than 2.044MeV/c2 (four <b>electron</b> <b>masses),</b> emission of two positrons is possible. These theoretical decay branches have not been observed.|$|R

25|$|The energy {{spectrum}} of an electron {{moving in a}} periodical potential of rigid crystal lattice consists of allowed and forbidden bands and {{is known as the}} Bloch spectrum. An electron with energy inside an allowed band moves as a free electron but has an effective mass that differs from the <b>electron</b> <b>mass</b> in vacuum. However, a crystal lattice is deformable and displacements of atoms (ions) from their equilibrium positions are described in terms of phonons. Electrons interact with these displacements, and this interaction is known as electron-phonon coupling. One of possible scenarios was proposed in the seminal 1933 paper by Lev Landau, which includes the production of a lattice defect such as an F-center and a trapping of the electron by this defect. A different scenario was proposed by Solomon Pekar that envisions dressing the electron with lattice deformation (a cloud of virtual phonons). Such an electron with the accompanying deformation moves freely across the crystal, but with increased effective mass. Pekar coined for this charge carrier the term polaron.|$|E

30|$|Effective mass is more complicated, {{since it}} depends on carrier and direction. There are three points that should be noted on {{effective}} <b>mass.</b> First, the <b>electron</b> effective <b>mass</b> of 100 % HG and 100 %-HG/h-BN heterobilayer are isotropic, i.e., m*(ΓM)[*]=[*]m*(ΓK). The heterobilayer structure leads to a slight drop of <b>electron</b> effective <b>mass</b> compared with 100 % HG monolayer. The stacking pattern has slight influence on the <b>electron</b> effective <b>mass</b> (all of the four stacking patterns are about 0.90). Second, under the same hydrogenation pattern (i.e., 100 %, 25 % pattern I and 6.25 % pattern I), the electron m*(ΓK) decreases with the decreased hydrogen coverage. It is shown that the limit is 0.024 (the effective mass of graphene) as the hydrogen coverage reduces to zero. Third, under the same hydrogen coverage, effective mass is also affected by hydrogenation pattern. For 25 % HG, the <b>electron</b> effective <b>mass</b> of pattern I is {{much lower than the}} other two.
