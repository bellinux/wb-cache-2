50|$|Portunus trituberculatus, the <b>gazami</b> <b>crab,</b> Japanese {{blue crab}} or horse crab, {{is the most}} widely fished species of crab in the world. It is found off the coasts of East Asia and {{is closely related to}} Portunus pelagicus.|$|E
50|$|Portunus is a genus of crab which {{includes}} several important species for fisheries, {{such as the}} blue swimming crab, Portunus pelagicus and the <b>Gazami</b> <b>crab,</b> P. trituberculatus. Other species, such as the three-spotted crab (P. sanguinolentus) are caught as bycatch.|$|E
30|$|The main {{marine species}} in {{worldwide}} capture over years were {{the families of}} Gardidae (Alaska Pollock, Atlantic Cod, Blue Whiting, Pacific Cod), Engraulidae (Anchoveta, Japaneese Anchovy), Scombridae (Skipjack Tuna, Chub Mackerel, Yellowfish Tuna, Atlantic Mackerel, Seerfishes Nei), Clupeidae (Sardinellas Nei, Atlantic Herring, European Pilchard, Araucanian Herring, European Sprat, Pacific Herring), Carangidae (Scads Nei), Trichiuridae (Largehead Hairtail), Ommastrephidae (Humboldt Squid, Argentine Shortfin Squid), Nemipteridae (Threadfin Breams Nei), Scomberesocidae (Pacific Saury), Portunidae (<b>Gazami</b> <b>Crab),</b> Akiami Paste Shrimp (FAO 2016). Worldwide, the most important fish families farmed in aquaculture are Cyprinidae (Carp), Salmonidae (Salmon, Trout), Serranidae (Seabass), Acipenseridae (Sturgeon), Scophthalmidae (Turbot), Sparidae (Sea Bream), Mytilidae (Mussels), Ostreidae (Oysters) and some families of clams (European Comission 2012). Thus, due to the abundance of aforeisaid species in worldwide fishing production, an attention must be paid on better utilization of a big amount of by-products rested after their processing.|$|E
