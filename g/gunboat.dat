5|$|USS De Soto was a fast wooden-hulled sidewheel {{steamship}} {{that saw}} {{service as a}} U.S. Navy <b>gunboat</b> during the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|De Soto {{made one}} further voyage to Havana in June. On 21 August 1861, she was {{purchased}} by the U.S. Navy for the sum of $161,250 for conversion into a <b>gunboat.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 1892, Bennington was {{transferred}} to the South Atlantic Squadron and cruised South American waters until 19 July. Setting out from Bahia, Brazil, the <b>gunboat</b> visited Spanish and Italian ports during the 400thanniversary celebration of Columbus' voyage to the western hemisphere. She concluded the European portion of those festivities on 18 February 1893 when she departed Cadiz, with a replica of Columbus’s caravel Pinta in tow for Cuba. After stops in the Canary Islands, the Netherlands West Indies, and Havana, the <b>gunboat</b> arrived back in the United States at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 26 March.|$|E
50|$|Seta class <b>gunboats</b> (Seta-gata hōkan) were a {{class of}} {{riverine}} <b>gunboats</b> of the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|R
50|$|The Asheville-class <b>gunboats</b> were {{originally}} designated PGM motor <b>gunboats,</b> but were reclassified in 1967 as PG patrol combatant ships.|$|R
50|$|The 10.5 cm SK L/35 {{were used}} as primary or {{secondary}} armament aboard Corvettes, <b>Gunboats,</b> Pre-dreadnought battleships, Protected cruisers, Torpedo <b>gunboats</b> and Unprotected cruisers.|$|R
5|$|On 6 August 1936, {{during the}} first weeks of the Spanish Civil War, Basilisk became {{involved}} {{in the aftermath of the}} naval action known as Convoy de la Victoria, when she was shelled and straddled by the ageing Spanish nationalist <b>gunboat</b> Dato while arriving in Gibraltar. The <b>gunboat</b> misidentified the British warship as a republican destroyer of the Churruca-class. In February 1937 Basilisk arrived at the port of Málaga, Spain, captured a few days before by the Franco's forces. Basilisks captain gained the release of Sir Peter Chalmers Mitchell, a British zoologist resident in Málaga, who was arrested by Franco's troops due to his support of the Spanish Republic.|$|E
5|$|The German naval {{contingent}} (numbering four, {{compared to}} the United Kingdom's eight) followed the British lead in operational terms. On 11 December 1902, the Gazelle boarded the old <b>gunboat</b> Restaurador in the port of Guanta. The <b>gunboat</b> was towed at anchor and put into service by the German Captain-Lieutenant Titus Türk with crew members of the Gazelle as SMS Restaurador. On 23 February 1903 was the return to Venezuela, where the ship was by the extent of repair work {{in a much better}} condition than the removal.|$|E
5|$|The KJRM {{included}} several miscellaneous vessels {{that were not}} allocated to a particular division. They included the gunnery training ship Dalmacija, the <b>gunboat</b> Beli Orao and the converted seaplane tender/minelayer Zmaj.|$|E
50|$|Five <b>gunboats</b> were {{anchored}} {{just beyond}} the sunken junks. They were the Siamese <b>gunboats</b> Makut Ratchakuman, Narubent Butri, Thun Kramon, Muratha Wisitsawat, and Han Hak. Two were modern warships while the others were older <b>gunboats</b> or converted river steamers. A sea mine field of sixteen explosives was also laid. Many Europeans served in the Siamese military at this time: a Dutch admiral commanded the fort, and the <b>gunboats</b> were commanded by a Danish Vice Admiral granted the royal title of Phraya Chonlayutyothin.|$|R
50|$|Ruotsinsalmi {{together}} with Riilahti participated in ferrying the Finnish <b>gunboats</b> past Hanko in August 1941. After two failed attempts by <b>gunboats</b> to rendezvous with minelayers on the nights of 25-26 and 27-28 August the minelayers penetrated the Soviet minefield {{and met with}} the <b>gunboats</b> west of Hanko and then escorted them through to Helsinki on 29 August 1941.|$|R
50|$|Fushimi class <b>gunboats</b> (Fushimi-gata hōkan) were a {{class of}} {{riverine}} <b>gunboats</b> of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The class consisted of two ships, Fushimi (伏見) and Sumida (隅田).|$|R
5|$|The total German losses, in the area, during 6 June are unknown. Fourteen {{tanks were}} lost during the fighting; the first during the night, and the {{remaining}} 13 throughout the day. Other losses include one <b>gunboat</b> on the Caen canal.|$|E
5|$|Two {{vessels of}} the Royal Navy were named HMS Mayfly: a torpedo boat {{launched}} in January 1907, and a Fly-class river <b>gunboat</b> constructed in sections at Yarrow in 1915.|$|E
5|$|After visiting Cavite on Luzon, the <b>gunboat</b> {{headed for}} Japan on 3 April and {{underwent}} repairs there from 9 April to 19 May before {{heading back to}} the Philippines. The warship arrived at Cavite on 27 May and resumed patrols on 3 June. She spent another seven months conducting patrols in the Philippines and supporting the Army’s operations in the island chain. On 3 January 1901, she departed Cavite and shaped a course for Hong Kong. The <b>gunboat</b> arrived in that British colony on the 6th and began over six months of repairs. At the completion of that work, she departed Hong Kong on 25 June. After a visit to Shanghai, the warship headed back to the United States in July and arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 19 August. She was decommissioned there on 5 September 1901.|$|E
50|$|The Atami-class <b>gunboats</b> (Atami-gata hōkan) were a {{class of}} {{riverine}} <b>gunboats</b> of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The class consisted of two vessels: Atami (熱海) and Futami (二見).|$|R
50|$|In October 1883 Admiral Courbet {{asked the}} navy {{ministry}} {{to design a}} new class of shallow-draft <b>gunboats</b> which could penetrate the maze of shallow tributary streams and arroyos of the Delta, so that the Black Flags and pirates could be hunted down far more effectively. The ministry accepted his recommendations, and laid down two new classes of <b>gunboats.</b> Eight <b>gunboats</b> of the Henri Rivière class were designed and built specifically for service in Tonkin, while more than a dozen <b>gunboats</b> of the Arquebuse class were produced for use in both Tonkin and Madagascar.|$|R
25|$|Shortly thereafter, the Spanish {{squadron}} entered Algeciras towing {{the four}} prizes with 120 prisoners, {{among them the}} commander of the British <b>gunboats</b> of Gibraltar. None of the later British countermeasures to beat the Spanish <b>gunboats,</b> which included the use of grapeshot from a distance, had any effect. The Spanish <b>gunboats</b> proved their worth in subsequent years when they defended two major merchant convoys.|$|R
5|$|Arriving at San Diego on 15 February 1919, Yorktown {{was placed}} out of {{commission}} at Mare Island on 12 June 1919. On 17 June 1920, she was assigned the hull number PG-1. The veteran steel-hulled <b>gunboat</b> was sold to the Union Hide Company of Oakland, California, on 30 September 1921; she was broken up in Oakland sometime after that.|$|E
5|$|German {{military}} officers were {{disappointed by the}} limited extent of the attack, which ultimately achieved more political goals than strategic ones. Russia's Black Sea Fleet was not seriously damaged by the raid. The <b>gunboat</b> Donetz was later raised and returned to service.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gunboat</b> {{diplomacy}} {{was typically}} conducted by cruisers or smaller warships. A British squadron of three protected cruisers and two gunboats {{brought about the}} capitulation of Zanzibar in 1896; and while battleships participated in the combined fleet Western powers deployed during the Boxer rebellion, the naval part of the action was performed by gunboats, destroyers and sloops.|$|E
50|$|Flat-iron <b>gunboats</b> (more {{formally}} {{known as}} Rendel <b>gunboats)</b> {{were a number}} of classes of coastal <b>gunboats</b> generally characterised by small size, low freeboard, the absence of masts, and the mounting of a single non-traversing large gun, aimed by pointing the vessel. They acquired their nickname from the physical similarity with the flat iron used for ironing clothes during the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The Tonkin Flotilla {{consisted}} initially of {{the light}} frigates (avisos à roues) Pluvier and Alouette, the seagoing <b>gunboats</b> Fanfare, Léopard and Surprise, the large river <b>gunboats</b> (avisos de flotille à roues) Éclair and Trombe, and the smaller river <b>gunboats</b> (chaloupes-cannonières démontables) Carabine, Hache, Massue and Yatagan. Alouette was normally stationed in Cochinchina, and {{does not seem to}} have seen service in Tonkin.|$|R
50|$|Shortly thereafter, the Spanish {{squadron}} entered Algeciras towing {{the four}} prizes with 120 prisoners, {{among them the}} commander of the British <b>gunboats</b> of Gibraltar.

5|$|In 1910–11 and 1914, Asama {{served as}} a {{training}} ship, making cruises with naval cadets to North and Central American and Hawaii, among other destinations. After the start of World War I in August 1914, she was assigned to search for Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee's German East Asia Squadron in the South Sea Islands. In late October, the ship was ordered to blockade a German <b>gunboat</b> in Honolulu, Hawaii before she {{was assigned to the}} American Expeditionary Squadron, the Japanese component of a joint Anglo-Japanese command to protect shipping of the western coast of the Americas, off the Mexican coast after the <b>gunboat</b> was interned in early November. The squadron then spent the next several months for German commerce raiders.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Hashimoto {{volunteered for}} the {{submarine}} service, and in 1937, he served aboard destroyers and submarine chasers off {{the shores of the}} Republic of China. On 15 November, as a sub-lieutenant, Hashimoto was assigned to the crew of the <b>gunboat</b> Hozu, and was promoted to lieutenant on 1 December. During that time, his brother was killed in action fighting on the Chinese mainland.|$|E
5|$|Mathews and Cave {{also began}} to muster their forces, already {{commanding}} 900 Zanzibari askaris under Lieutenant Arthur Edward Harington Raikes of the Wiltshire Regiment who was seconded to the Zanzibar Army and held the rank of brigadier-general. 150 sailors and marines were landed from the Pearl-class protected cruiser Philomel and the <b>gunboat</b> Thrush, which were anchored in the harbour. The naval contingent, {{under the command of}} Captain O'Callaghan, came ashore within fifteen minutes of being requested to deal with any rioting caused by the general population. A smaller contingent of sailors under Lieutenant Watson of Thrush were put ashore to guard the British consulate, where British citizens were requested to gather for protection. HMS Sparrow, another <b>gunboat,</b> entered the harbour and was anchored opposite the palace next to Thrush.|$|E
5000|$|The Dubuque class <b>gunboats</b> were a {{class of}} <b>gunboats</b> built by the United States prior to World War I. The class was {{designed}} in 1903. The United States Navy commissioned 2 Dubuque-class <b>gunboats</b> in 1903. Dubuques had a design speed of 12 knots, and a main armament of six 4" [...] rapid-fire guns and four 6-pounder rapid-fire guns in single mounts.|$|R
50|$|Several vessels under Rivière's command were {{normally}} {{stationed in}} Cochinchina or Cambodia, including the troopship Drac, the light frigate Alouette {{and the small}} <b>gunboats</b> Framée and Javeline. Tilsitt, the flagship of the Cochinchina naval division, was disarmed and in permanent dock at Saigon, and served as the division’s storehouse and administrative centre. Most of the division's vessels, however, were stationed in Tonkin, where they were enforcing the right of free navigation on the Red River conceded to France by the Vietnamese government in 1874. Rivière's command in Tonkin consisted of the light frigates Hamelin, Parseval and Antilope (the latter due to be replaced shortly by Pluvier), the heavy <b>gunboats</b> Lynx and Vipère, the seagoing <b>gunboats</b> Fanfare, Léopard and Surprise, and the smaller river <b>gunboats</b> Carabine, Éclair, Hache, Massue, Trombe and Yatagan. The heavy <b>gunboats</b> had crews of 77 men and mounted four cannon, while the smaller <b>gunboats</b> had two cannon each. They all carried a Hotchkiss canon-revolver in their tops.|$|R
5000|$|Britain built a {{large number}} of wooden screw-gunboats during the 1850s, some of which participated in the Crimean War (1853-1856), Second Opium War (1856-1860) and Indian Mutiny (1857-1859). The {{requirement}} for <b>gunboats</b> in the Crimean War was formulated in 1854 to allow the Royal Navy to bombard shore facilities in the Baltic. The first ships the Royal Navy built that met this requirement were the Arrow-class gunvessels. Then in mid-1854 the Royal Navy ordered six Gleaner-class <b>gunboats</b> followed later in the year by an order for 20 Dapper-class <b>gunboats.</b> [...] In May 1855 the Royal Navy deployed six Dapper-class <b>gunboats</b> in the Sea of Azov, where they repeatedly raided and destroyed stores around its coast. In June 1855 the Royal Navy reentered the Baltic with a total of 18 <b>gunboats</b> {{as part of a larger}} fleet. The <b>gunboats</b> attacked various coastal facilities, operating alongside larger British warships from which they drew supplies such as coal.|$|R
5|$|On 14 September 1914, Asama was {{departed}} Yokosuka {{as part of}} the 1st South Seas Squadron that {{searched for}} Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee's German East Asia Squadron in the South Sea Islands. On 25 October, the ship was detached and ordered to Honolulu, Hawaii, to prevent the departure of the German <b>gunboat</b> , together with the ex-Russian battleship Hizen. After the <b>gunboat</b> was interned on 8 November, the two ships sailed to rendezvous with the other ships of the American Expeditionary Squadron at Magdalena Bay, Baja California on the 22nd. The squadron then headed south to search along the western coast of South America for German commerce raiders. On 11 December, after the receiving the news of the British victory in the Battle of the Falkland Islands, the squadron moved north to search off the western coast of Central America and then moved north to search Mexican and U.S. waters in January.|$|E
5|$|On 8 August, she resumed cruises {{along the}} west coast. That {{employment}} lasted {{a year and a}} week. On 14 August 1897, Bennington headed back to Hawaii. She arrived in Lahaina Roads on 27 September and reached Honolulu on the 30th. Except for a six-day cruise back to Lahaina in March 1898, the <b>gunboat</b> remained at Honolulu for just over nine months.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia was {{exhibited}} at various locations on Lake Champlain and the Hudson River {{before becoming a}} long-term display at Exeter, New York. Lorenzo Hagglund spent years searching for other ships in Arnold's fleet, and raised another <b>gunboat</b> in 1952. Funding for a structure to house that find and Royal Savage fell through, and that boat's remains were eventually ruined through neglect and looting.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{additions}} to the fleet were the <b>gunboats</b> Guangheng, Guangli, Guangyuan and Guangzhen. These shallow draft <b>gunboats,</b> built at the Whampoa dockyard, were designed to guard the approaches to Canton.|$|R
50|$|The battle resumed as the Norwegian <b>gunboats</b> {{found their}} way into Lyngør. At 2 a.m. on 7 July, Dictator pulled herself off and departed, harried out of Norwegian waters by the <b>gunboats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Of course, the British Royal Navy {{had three}} generations of <b>gunboats</b> on the Yangtze River {{spanning}} fifty years. The first were the Heron-class river <b>gunboats,</b> ofwhich HMS Nightingale 1897-98; and HMS Robin, HMS Sandpiper, HMS Snipe served on Yangtze and West Rivers until 1914 and were sold in 1919.Later, in the Woodcock Class of <b>gunboats</b> came into service: these included the Woodcock, Moorhen, Teal and Widgeon.|$|R
