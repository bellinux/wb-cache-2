25|$|The {{choice of}} belt is {{critical}} to the function of the belt press filter and a wide variety of materials and weaves are available. The <b>filter</b> <b>cloth</b> for a belt press filter should be as open as possible while maintaining the desired filtrate clarity or, if precoat is used, to prevent the loss of precoat. Lighter cloths produce a clearer filtrate and do not block as rapidly however their durability and life span is significantly shorter than heavier cloths. Both seamless and seamed belts are available. Seamed belts wear faster at the seam and cause wear at the rollers and the doctor blade. Zipper-type and clipper-type seamed belts are also available with the zipper-type having a longer life span as they provide less discontinuity. Seamless belts have the longest life span but are more expensive. Also it should be ensured that the belt press is compatible with a seamless belt.|$|E

The roadway was overwashed by waves {{from the lake}} during a storm on May 31, 1985; the waves littered the road with gravel and dirt and raised fears of erosion.

30|$|The {{two main}} {{mechanical}} expression methods were hydraulic pressing and windmill powered expression. Both {{were used to}} produce linseed oil for artists’ paints [28, 30, 31]. In the Netherlands and in Belgium extraction of linseed oil was chiefly done {{with the use of}} wind power until the 1900 s [32, 33]. Windmills were equipped with a ‘Kollergang’ (two edge runner stones rolling on the pan) that crushed the seeds, which were then wrapped in <b>filter</b> <b>cloths</b> and expressed with a wedge press. The hydraulic press was invented by Joseph Bramah in 1795; the expression outlet of his press was based on the traditional oil mill method with <b>filter</b> <b>cloths.</b> At the end of the 19 th century German companies produced hydraulic cage presses, with rams pressing the seeds inside of vertical slotted barrels that did not require <b>filter</b> <b>cloths</b> [29].

50|$|To {{extract the}} alginate, the seaweed is broken into pieces and stirred {{with a hot}} {{solution}} of an alkali, usually sodium carbonate. Over {{a period of about}} two hours, the alginate dissolves as sodium alginate to give a very thick slurry. This slurry also contains the part of the seaweed that does not dissolve, mainly cellulose. This insoluble residue must be removed from the solution. The solution is too thick (viscous) to be filtered and must be diluted with a very large quantity of water. After dilution, the solution is forced through a <b>filter</b> <b>cloth</b> in a filter press. However, the pieces of undissolved residue are very fine and can quickly clog the <b>filter</b> <b>cloth.</b> Therefore, before filtration is started, a filter aid, such as diatomaceous earth, must be added; this holds most of the fine particles away {{from the surface of the}} <b>filter</b> <b>cloth</b> and facilitates filtration. However, filter aid is expensive and can make a significant contribution to costs. To reduce the quantity of filter aid needed, some processors force air into the extract as it is being diluted with water (the extract and diluting water are mixed in an in-line mixer into which air is forced). Fine air bubbles attach themselves to the particles of residue. The diluted extract is left standing for several hours while the air rises to the top, taking the residue particles with it. This frothy mix of air and residue is removed from the top and the solution is withdrawn from the bottom and pumped to the filter.|$|E

40|$|To meet stricter {{effluent}} discharge limits of total phosphorus, microscreens {{can be applied}} for tertiary effluent treatment. The Rya WWTP has recently been upgraded with microscreens {{in the form of}} disc filters. Extensive characterisation of the wastewater from different locations in the plant (influent, after primary settling) and secondary settler effluent, was performed to increase the understanding of the potential of removing different components from the wastewater. The wastewater was fractionated by filtration through <b>filter</b> <b>cloths</b> with pore sizes 40, 20, 15, and 10 µm and through finer filters with pore size 1. 2, 0. 45, 0. 2 and 0. 1 µm. Particle size analysis (PSA) was used to assess the removal efficiency of the <b>filter</b> <b>cloths.</b> High removal degrees were achieved were particles larger or equal in size to the pore size were strained. Some floc break-up took place leading to an increased number of small particles (1 - 5 µm) after filtration. The suspended solids concentration could be reduced to 1 mg/l with total phosphorus concentrations of < 0. 2 mg/l. Some removal of metals could be observed when filtering wastewater with higher concentrations (influent and secondary settler effluent) whereas no effect could be seen for the effluent wastewater, probably due to the low concentrations present. The results from this study indicate a poor removal efficiency of pathogens measured as indicator microorganisms...|$|R

50|$|Tailings do {{not have}} to be stored in ponds or sent as {{slurries}} into oceans, rivers or streams. There is a growing use of the practice of dewatering tailings using vacuum or pressure filters so the tailings can then be stacked. This saves water which potentially reduces the impacts on the environment in terms of a reduction in the potential seepage rates, space used, leaves the tailings in a dense and stable arrangement and eliminates the long-term liability that ponds leave after mining is finished. However although there are potential merits to dry stacked tailings these systems are often cost prohibitive due to increased capital cost to purchase and install the filter systems and the increase in operating costs (generally associated electricity consumption and consumables such as <b>filter</b> <b>cloth)</b> of such systems.|$|E

50|$|Generally, the slurry {{that will}} be {{separated}} is injected {{into the center of}} the press and each chamber of the press is filled. Optimal filling time will ensure the last chamber of the press is loaded before the mud in the first chamber begins to cake.

Then, the liquid is strained through <b>filter</b> <b>cloths</b> by force using compressed air or water.
