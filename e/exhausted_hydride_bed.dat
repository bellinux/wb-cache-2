A simple gas handling manifold fitted with pressure transducers and a calibrated volume were used to introduce controlled quantities of air into a metal <b>hydride</b> <b>bed</b> and the bed temperature rise monitored for reactivity with the air. A desorbed, 4. 4 kg titanium prototype hydride storage vessel (HSV) produced a 4. 4 C internal temperature rise upon the first air exposure cycle and a 0. 1 C temperature rise upon a second air exposure. A total of 346 scc air was consumed by the bed (0. 08 scc per gram Ti).

Advanced concept heat exchangers to improve the heat transfer of the <b>hydride</b> <b>bed</b> with the heat transfer fluid are discussed. Preliminary tests made with a LaNi 5 loaded aluminum foam test unit showed that heat transfer properties are very markedly improved. Thermodynamic expressions are applied to the selection of alloys for use in HYCSOS.

40|$|Applications of {{hydriding}} {{materials for}} solid state hydrogen storage, hydrogen compression, {{thermal energy storage}} and sorption heating and cooling systems have been demonstrated successfully. However, the performance of these devices significantly depends upon heat and mass transfer characteristics of the reactive packed beds. One of the important parameters regulating heat and mass transfer in the <b>hydriding</b> <b>bed</b> is its effective thermal conductivity (ETC), which is dependent on several operating parameters such as pressure and temperature. ETC also varies significantly due to the variation of hydrogen concentration during the hydriding and dehydriding processes.

The 1. 2 meter (four-foot) long process vessel contains an internal ''U-tube'' for tritium In-Bed Accountability (IBA) measurements. IBA will be performed on six, 12. 6 kg production metal <b>hydride</b> storage <b>beds.</b> IBA tests were done on a prototype bed using electric heaters to simulate the radiolytic decay of tritium. Tests had gas flows from 10 to 100 SLPM through the U-tube or 100 SLPM through the bed's vacuum jacket. IBA inventory measurement errors at the 95 percent confidence level were calculated using the correlation of IBA gas temperature rise, or (<b>hydride)</b> <b>bed</b> temperature rise above ambient temperature, versus simulated tritium inventory. Prototype bed IBA inventory errors at 100 SLPM were the largest for gas flows through the vacuum jacket: 15. 2 grams for the bed temperature rise and 11. 5 grams for the gas temperature rise. For a 100 SLPM U-tube flow, the inventory error was 2. 5 grams using bed temperature rise and 1. 6 grams using gas temperature rise. For 50 to 100 SLPM U-tube flows, the IBA gas temperature rise inventory errors were nominally one to two grams that increased above four grams for flows less than 50 SLPM. For 50 to 100 SLPM U-tube flows, the IBA bed temperature rise inventory errors were greater than the gas temperature rise errors, but similar errors were found for both methods at gas flows of 20, 30, and 40 SLPM. Electric heater IBA tests were done for six production <b>hydride</b> <b>beds</b> using a 45 SLPM U-tube gas flow.

40|$|The {{performance}} of metal hydride based solid sorption cooling systems {{depends on the}} driving pressure differential, {{and the rate of}} hydrogen transfer between coupled metal <b>hydride</b> <b>beds</b> during cooling and regeneration processes. Conventionally, the mid-plateau pressure difference obtained from `static' equilibrium PCT data are used for the thermodynamic analysis. It is well known that the processes are `dynamic' because the pressure and temperature, and hence the concentration of the <b>hydride</b> <b>beds,</b> are continuously changing. Keeping this in mind, the pair of La 0. 9 Ce 0. 1 Ni 5 - LaNi 4. 7 Al 0. 3 metal hydrides suitable for solid sorption cooling systems were characterised using both static and dynamic methods. It was found that the PCT characteristics, and the resulting enthalpy (Delta H) and entropy (Delta S) values, were significantly different for static and dynamic modes of measurements. In the present study, the solid sorption metal hydride cooling system is analysed taking in to account the actual variation in the pressure difference (Delta P) and the dynamic enthalpy values. Compared to `static' property based analysis, significant decrease in the driving potentials and transferrable amounts of hydrogen, leading to decrease in cooling capacity by 57. 8 % and coefficient of performance by 31. 9 % are observed when dynamic PCT data at the flow rate of 80 ml/min are considered.

Direct electrochemical conversion {{would be the}} ideal, but, for most fuels, is generally not within the state-of-the-science.

This small investigative project was an exploration into the feasibility of a novel hybrid (i. e., thermal-electrochemical) micropower converter of high theoretical performance whose demonstration {{was thought to be}} within near-term reach.

Heating is provided by the exothermic combustion (i. e., either flame combustion or catalytic combustion) of a chemical fuel. Upon hydride source depletion, the role of source and sink are reversed, heating and cooling reversed, electrodes commutatively reversed, cell operation reversed, while power delivery continues unchanged.

40|$|Prasad, Ajay K. Advani, Suresh G. The overall {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to accelerate the rate at which hydrogen gas can be charged into a hydride-based hydrogen storage tank. During the charging process, the absorption reaction of hydrogen gas into a metal <b>hydride</b> <b>bed</b> is exothermic. The temperature of the system will increase if the heat released is not removed quickly from the system and reduce the absorption rate. Hence, the rate of hydrogen storage into a tank containing metal hydride materials strongly depends on the heat removal rate from the hydrogen storage system. To increase the heat removal rate the following four approaches were explored: (i) Enhancement of the thermal conductivity of the metal <b>hydride</b> <b>bed</b> by incorporating conductivity-enhancing materials such as aluminum (Al) foam. (ii) The use of genetic algorithms to optimize the parameters and placement of spiral coil heat exchangers with fins. (iii) Introduction of an active cooling environment by embedding a helical coil heat exchanger into the hydrogen storage tank. (iv) Use of a physical mixing method to improve the heat removal rate. In order to investigate the effectiveness and the role of various factors in the above proposed approaches, we developed a numerical model that incorporates flow, reaction kinetics and heat transfer within the software package ANSYS. Simulations were used to explore various storage tank designs containing hydride materials and various cooling enhancement methods to find the optimal materials and design for accelerating the charging rate of the hydrogen into the tank.

The 2 nd generation (Gen 2) of the bed design used the same NPS for the PV, but the added internal components produced a bed nominally 1. 2 m long, and presented a significant challenge for heater cartridge replacement in a footprint limited glove-box. A prototype 3 rd generation (Gen 3) metal <b>hydride</b> storage <b>bed</b> has been designed and fabricated as a replacement candidate for the Gen 2 storage bed. The prototype Gen 3 bed uses a PV pipe diameter of 4 inch NPS so the bed length can be reduced below 0. 7 m to facilitate heater cartridge replacement. For the Gen 3 prototype bed, modeling results show increased absorption rates when using hydrides with lower absorption pressures. To improve absorption performance compared to the Gen 2 beds, a LaNi{sub 4. 15 }Al{sub 0. 85 } material was procured and processed to obtain the desired pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) properties. Other bed design improvements are also presented...|$|R
40|$|For {{safety and}} {{operability}} concerns, {{the use of}} metal hydrides to store hydrogen appears to be particularly promising option for alternative energy at present. However, the process of adding, removing and distributing heat during the hydrogen charging/ discharging process is problematic due to the poor effective thermal conductivity of the metal <b>hydride</b> porous <b>bed</b> and the high enthalpies of H 2 adsorption/desorption. Therefore, heat transfer is a critical factor affecting the performance of metal hydride hydrogen (MHR) storage tanks. Over decade, many researches focused on MHR’s operating conditions and its thermal management to improve its performance...|$|R
40|$|Metal hydride {{composites}} (MHC), which {{consist of}} a primary hydrogen absorbing phase and secondary phases such as graphite, offer very high volumetric storage densities and operation dynamics compared to widely used metal <b>hydride</b> powder <b>beds.</b> Here, {{we report on the}} stress evolution of confined MHC during hydrogen ab- and desorption which is due to the lattice expansion of the hydrogen absorbing phase during hydrogen uptake. The stress development during hydrogenation was recorded in situ using a specially designed measuring cell. Influences of gas pressure, temperature and MHC geometry on the stress evolution were considered. In this regard, so-called pressure-stress-isotherms are proposed {{for the first time in}} thermomechanical analogy to pressure-composition-isotherms...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} model {{investigating the}} hydrogen charging {{process in a}} combination reactor filled with both LaNi 4. 3 Al 0. 4 Mn 0. 3 and 2 LiNH 2 - 1. 1 MgH 2 - 0. 1 LiBH 4 - 3 wt. %ZrCoH 3 materials has been developed. The selected configuration is a cylindrical reactor of 32 cm of diameter where the MeH is filled in annular tubes separated from the complex <b>hydride</b> <b>bed</b> by a gas permeable layer. The diffusion of hydrogen towards the two storage media is ensured by filters embedded {{in the middle of}} the MeH tubes whereas the coolant tubes are placed in the centre of their triangular arrangement. Simulation results have shown that the charging process depends on the MeH reaction heat required for the initiation of the CxH reaction as well as the heat management once the complex hydride starts to store hydrogen. High hydrogen storage rates and short refueling times can be obtained by increasing the number of MeH and coolant tubes and ensuring an efficient heat removal at the peripheral area of the CxH media. A refueling time of 3 min is achieved for an optimum configuration of 49 MeH tubes and 96 coolant tubes while increasing the thermal conductivity of the CxH media to 3. 5 W/(m K). Such a result could make the identified optimum configuration as a suitable hydrogen storage system for fuel cell forklift trucks since it meets the requirements of this application in terms of weight and size...|$|R
40|$|Prasad, Ajay K. Advani, Suresh G. Metal {{hydrides}} {{can store}} hydrogen at high volumetric efficiencies. As {{the process of}} charging hydrogen into a metal powder to form its hydride is exothermic, the heat released must be removed quickly to maintain a rapid charging rate. An effective heat removal method is to incorporate a heat exchanger such as a heat pipe within the metal <b>hydride</b> <b>bed.</b> In this paper, we describe a two-dimensional axi-symmetric study to predict the transient heat and mass transfer in a cylindrical metal hydride tank embedded {{with one or more}} heat pipes. Results from a parametric study of hydrogen storage efficiency are presented as a function of storage tank size, water jacket temperature and its convective heat transfer coefficient, and heat pipe radius and its convective heat transfer coefficient. The effect of enhancing the thermal conductivity of the metal hydride by adding aluminum foam is also investigated. The study reveals that the cooling water jacket temperature and the heat pipe's heat transfer coefficient are most influential in determining the heat removal rate. The addition of aluminum foam reduces the filling time as expected. For larger tanks, more than one heat pipe is necessary for rapid charging. It was found that using more heat pipes of smaller radii is better than using fewer heat pipes with larger radii. The optimal distribution of multiple heat pipes was also determined and it is shown that their relative position within the tank scales with the tank size.

40|$|Design, construction, initial {{testing and}} simple thermal {{modeling}} of modular, metal <b>hydride</b> <b>beds</b> have been completed. Originally designed for supplying hydrogen to {{a fuel cell}} on a mobile vehicle, the complete bed design consists of 8 modules and is intended for use on the Palm Desert Vehicle (PDV) under development at the Schatz Energy Center, Humbolt State University. Each module contains approximately 2 kg of a commercially available, low temperature, hydride-forming metal alloy. Waste heat from the fuel cell {{in the form of}} heated water is used to desorb hydrogen from the alloy for supplying feed hydrogen to the fuel cell. In order to help determine the performance of such a modular bed system, six modules were constructed and tested. The design and construction of the modules is described in detail. Initial testing of the modules both individually and as a group showed that each module can store {approximately} 30 g of hydrogen (at 165 PSIA fill pressure, 17 C), could be filled with hydrogen in 6 minutes at a nominal, 75 standard liters/min (slm) fueling rate, and could supply hydrogen during desorption at rates of 25 slm, the maximum anticipated hydrogen fuel cell input requirement. Tests made of 5 modules as a group indicated that the behavior of the group run in parallel both in fueling and gas delivery could be directly predicted from the corresponding, single module characteristics by using an appropriate scaling factor. Simple thermal modeling of a module as an array of cylindrical, hydride-filled tubes was performed. The predictions of the model are in good agreement with experimental data...|$|R
