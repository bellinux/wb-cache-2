5|$|To {{commemorate the}} state’s 1916 centennial anniversary, the Indiana General Assembly issued a {{resolution}} to adopt a state flag. At {{the request of the}} General Assembly, a contest was sponsored by the Indiana Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution to design a flag to serve as the official state banner. As an incentive {{to increase the number of}} submissions, the contest offered the winner a one <b>hundred</b> <b>dollar</b> cash prize. More than two hundred submissions were received and examined by the Society before a winner was selected. The entry created by Paul Hadley of Mooresville, Indiana, was ultimately chosen as the winner of the contest and the cash prize.|$|E
25|$|More {{dramatic}} was {{the pricing}} of the One Hundred and Two <b>Hundred</b> <b>Dollar</b> gold. The {{beginning of the}} millennium saw the One <b>Hundred</b> <b>Dollar</b> Gold at $259.95 but its price increased to $359.95 by 2006. In 1990, the price of such a coin would have been $245.00. Due {{to the increase in}} the value of gold, the two <b>hundred</b> <b>dollar</b> gold experienced an even larger spike in the pricing. Starting in 2000 at $414.95, the price would rise to $564.95. In 1990, the price was only $395.00.|$|E
25|$|The decade {{would also}} be marked by very {{dramatic}} price increases.

25|$|To {{celebrate}} the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, the Royal Canadian Mint launches five and ten dollar coins. Seven series are created {{for a total}} of 28 different coins. Said coins are the first Canadian silver coins to feature face values of five and ten dollars. A one <b>hundred</b> <b>dollar</b> gold coin is also created, and this would be the first of the Modern Olympic coins to feature a face value of one hundred dollars.|$|E
25|$|From the outset, it {{was clear}} that Negroponte thought that the key to {{reducing}} the cost of the laptop was to reduce the cost of the display. Thus, when, upon return from Davos, he met Mary Lou Jepsen, the display pioneer who was in early 2005 joining the MIT Media Lab faculty, the discussions turned quickly to display innovation to enable a low-cost laptop. Convinced that the project was now possible, Negroponte led the creation of the first corporation for this: the <b>Hundred</b> <b>Dollar</b> Laptop Corp.|$|E

60|$|Before {{the regular}} {{allotment}} of shares was made, {{the claims of the}} wounded were fully satisfied according to their established code.

Then {{the rest of the money}} and spoils were divided among all the buccaneers without reference to what had been paid to the wounded. The shares of those who had been killed were given to friends or acquaintances, who undertook to deliver them to their families.|$|R
25|$|Expansion in the numismatic {{line was}} {{a key element of}} the 1990s. The first {{significant}} sign was the birth of the Two <b>Hundred</b> <b>Dollar</b> Gold coins. Starting in 1990, this coin was sold for a higher price than its face value. The first coin commemorated the Silver Jubilee of Canada's flag and sold for $395.00. The superstar of this collection would be the Canadian Native Cultures and Traditions coins. These coins were minted from 1997 to 2000. The Haida coin has been an award-winning coin for the RCM taking the Best Coin Award at the 1997 Singapore International Coin Show.|$|E

25|$|This {{was only}} the {{beginning}} for the RCM. The advent of the Two <b>Hundred</b> <b>Dollar</b> Gold series was quickly joined by a Platinum series. These high quality collector coins solidified the RCM's entry into the luxury coin market. A four coin set with face values of $30, $75, $150, and $300 respectively were complemented by the high quality artwork that adorned these luxury items. Famed artists such as Robert Bateman and Glen Loates contributed to these collections with polar bear and bird designs.

500|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the Jena Six rally, controversy arose about accounting and dispersal of the legal defense funds. Questions about the money were first sparked by photos posted on Robert Bailey's former MySpace account, which show him with quantities of <b>hundred</b> <b>dollar</b> bills stuffed in his mouth. The controversy expanded when radio host Michael Baisden accused Color of Change of being [...] "shady" [...] with {{their use of the}} funds. Color of Change responded to the accusations by posting links to canceled checks on their web site. In his November 10 report, Chicago Tribune correspondent Howard Witt noted that Color of Change was the only national civil rights group to be fully transparent with their use of the funds. But Witt raised broader questions about the funds, which totaled {{more than half a million}} dollars. He reported that attorneys for Bell claimed that they have yet to receive any money from him, and that the six families had refused to publicly account for the donations.|$|E
500|$|As the {{territory}} developed, their tasks changed; slaves {{also served as}} household servants and farm workers, {{as in the case}} of William Henry Harrison's slaves. George Rogers Clark's two slaves assisted him in running a gristmill in Clarksville. While the pro-slavery faction was in power, laws were passed permitting anyone to seize and return slaves who were more than ten miles from their home, and a one <b>hundred</b> <b>dollar</b> fine was placed on anyone who helped a slave escape. Some slaves, like [...] "Aunt Fannie", who belonged to Dennis Pennington, refused to be set free. Pennington had freed all his slaves when he left Virginia, but Fannie did not want to be left behind and continued on as a free household servant for the rest of her life. She was buried in the Pennington family cemetery in Corydon, Indiana. Others were not so fortunate {{as in the case of}} another black woman who also lived in Corydon. When she tried to escape from her masters she was run down in the street, beaten, and carried back home. The men threatened death to anyone in the town, which was strongly anti-slavery, who interfered.|$|E

[...] Danders had said this publicly after the plot had been revealed; city officials thought his comment suspicious. Danders was found guilty for showing sympathy to the slaves who had been caught trying to support the conspiracy. The final white defendant, Andrew S.
