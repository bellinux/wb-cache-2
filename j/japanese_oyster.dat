40|$|Noroviruses (NVs) cause {{many cases}} of oyster- or clam-associated {{gastroenteritis}} in various countries. We collected 191 samples from <b>Japanese</b> <b>oysters</b> intended for raw consumption that had been harvested from the sea in two different areas between December 2001 and February 2002. To detect, quantitate, and phylogenetically analyze the NV genome in purified concentrates from the stomachs and digestive diverticula of these oysters, we amplified the NV capsid gene by reverse transcription-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by using the neighbor-joining method. We detected the NV genome in 17 of 191 oysters (9 %). Phylogenetic analysis indicated genogroup I (Norwalk virus type) in 3 of the 17 oysters and genogroup II (Snow Mountain virus type) in the other 14. Both genogroups showed wide genetic diversity. To quantify the NV capsid gene in these oysters, we performed real-time PCR using genogroup-specific probes. More than 102 copies of the NV genome were detected in 11 of 17 oysters. The results suggested that about 10 % of <b>Japanese</b> <b>oysters</b> intended for raw consumption harbored NVs, and more than 50 % of those oysters in which NVs were detected had a large amount...|$|R

50|$|Species {{restoration}} {{projects for}} the Olympia oyster funded by the US Government are active in Puget Sound and San Francisco Bay. An active restoration project {{is taking place in}} Liberty Bay, Washington. This Puget Sound location is the home of an old and new Olympia oyster population. Intertidal areas with native oyster populations or evidence of past populations are strong candidates for re-introduction. The re-establishment of the population is currently threatened by the invasive <b>Japanese</b> <b>oyster</b> drill Ocenebra inornata. This species preys on the oysters by drilling a hole between the two valves and digesting the oyster's tissues.

50|$|Most of {{the global}} Pacific oyster spat supply comes from the wild, but some is now {{produced}} by hatchery methods. The seed from the wild can either be collected by the removal of seaweed from beaches or by hanging shell (cultch in suspension from long lines in the open water. The movement towards hatchery-reared spat is important, as wild seed is susceptible to changeable environmental conditions, such as toxic algal blooms, which can halt the supply of seed from that region. In addition, several pests have been noted as considerable dangers to oyster seed. The <b>Japanese</b> <b>oyster</b> drill (Ocenebra japonica), flatworm (Pseudostylochus osterophagus), and parasitic copepod (Mytlilcola orientalis) have been introduced accidentally to aquaculture areas, and have had serious impacts on oyster production, particularly in British Columbia and Europe.|$|E

Rugulopteryx okamurae is probably introduced in the Thau lagoon along with <b>Japanese</b> <b>oysters,</b> Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg 1793), imported into Europe for mariculture purposes.

In Europe it extends along the coasts of Great Britain, France, Scandinavia, Baltic Sea, Helgoland, Netherlands, Ireland, the Iberian Peninsula and into the Mediterranean from Italy and the Adriatic. It is recorded from Japan, China and Alaska. Recently, some specimens were found on Moroccan coasts. It illustrates its huge tolerance regarding to its environments.

5000|$|It is {{suspected}} that contact between Europeans and Indians became more numerous and consistent {{in the late}} 1700s. By the time Lewis & Clark arrived in 1806, Indians had firearms and metal implements. The first European settlers arrived in Netarts Bay in 1865, and records suggest native Olympia oysters were abundant in the bay. In fact, there are indications oyster harvests by European settlers began as early as 1868 and {{that at least some}} of these oysters were exported to San Francisco. Historic accounts indicate a shanty town, named Oysterville, was present in the bay during this time, and the bay was sometimes called [...] "Oyster Bay." [...] By 1903 virtually all shore line of the spit was claimed and occupied. Despite early claims, residential use of Netarts sand spit had mostly disappeared by 1920 and subsequent growth concentrated in Netarts along the northeast bay.

40|$|In {{the scope}} of BIOMON (initiated by RIKZ) Bureau Waardenburg bv {{executed}} hard substrate monitoring in the Scheldt estuary during the years 1989 till 1998. Sessile species can be indicator species for environmental changes and insight in their habitat can be of value during impact studies. The monitoring took place at two locations: Ritthem and Kruiningen. The biodiversity of the Ritthem {{over the years has}} been relatively high. This is probably due to strong marine influences at this location. Several species of seaweed occur here. In 1998 seaweedâ€™s where responsible for more than 50 % of the total amount of species. Since 1991 an immigrant, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>oyster</b> (Crassostrea gigas), has become more and more abundant, causing changes in species distribution and abundance at this location. Kruiningen has a relative low biodiversity compared to Ritthem. This is probably due to strong fluctuations of the salinity at this location, also indicated by the appearance of brackish water species. Only one seaweed lives here (Porphyra umbilicalis). Several other species come and go over the years causing clear changes in species distribution and abundance at this location. In comparison to the results at Ritthem, the abundance of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>oyster</b> also made a big increase at this location. The strong up come of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>oyster</b> can have a dramatic influence on the receiving ecosystem.

40|$|Gametes (sperm) and fertilized eggs (embryos) of the Mediterranean sea urchin, Paracentrotus lividus, and the <b>Japanese</b> <b>oyster,</b> Crassostrea gigas, {{were used}} to {{investigate}} the toxicity of two marine sediments, one polluted by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and the other by heavy metals. The sediment samples were freeze-dried for storage, and three different treatments were used for analysis: whole sediment, unfiltered elutriate, and filtered elutriate. The two sediments were toxic to sea urchin spermatozoa but not to oyster spermatozoa, and embryotoxicity was almost always the more sensitive endpoint for toxicity assessment. As a rule, whole sediment was more toxic than the elutriates by nearly two orders of magnitude. With respect to embryotoxicity, the whole sediments and the elutriates of the PAH-contaminated sediment were more toxic to oyster embryos, whereas the elutriates of the sediment polluted by heavy metals had stronger effects on sea urchin embryos. The results confirm that bioassays with <b>Japanese</b> <b>oyster</b> embryos provide a more sensitive appraisal of toxicity in the marine environment than bioassays with other developmental stages.

40|$|This project {{examined}} the effects on genetic diversity of oysters by hatchery techniques and selective breeding. The edible oyster industry in Australia comprises of two main species: Crassostrea gigas and Saccostrea glomerata, which are produced by hatcheries or natural spatfall, respectively. This study {{examined the}} levels of genetic diversity {{as a result of}} unintentional selection in C. gigas, {{and as a result of}} intentional selection (a selective breeding program to increase meat weight) in S. glomerata. This study has implications for aquaculture species worldwide as it examines the levels of genetic diversity in introduced (eg C. gigas) and a previously declining, native (S. glomerata) species, which comprise two of the main groups of species utilised for aquaculture. The oyster aquaculture industry in Tasmania is based on Pacific oysters, C. gigas, and derived from imports of <b>Japanese</b> <b>oysters</b> made some 40 years ago. Fears were held that introduction and subsequent domestication had eroded the genetic diversity. As the industry wished to embark on selective breeding programs, a genetic audit of the hatchery stocks was required. Four Australian established (ie non-hatchery produced) populations, and two of Japanese populations that originally imported, were analysed to determine the amount of genetic diversity present. Three different genetic techniques were employed - allozyme electrophoresis, microsatellite DNA and mitochondrial DNA RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) analyses. Using 17 allozyme loci, three hatchery and four naturalised populations of Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg) in Australia were compared with one another and with two endemic Japanese populations.
