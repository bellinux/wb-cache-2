5|$|During World War I, in his {{capacity}} as chair of the New England Forestry Commission, Brown worked with the War Industries Board to send 10 sawmills abroad. The equipment went to Scotland to meet Britain's need for lumber. When the war effort in France subsequently required more than 73 million board feet of lumber per month, Brown was commissioned as a major to oversee sawmill operations there, but ultimately was not allowed to serve in France because of his poor vision, as he was partially blind <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
5|$|He was Stoke's goalkeeper in the 1972 League Cup win â€“ the club's {{only major}} honour. He was still Stoke and England's number one {{when a car}} crash in October 1972 cost him both the sight <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> and his {{professional}} career. He did though play in the United States for the Fort Lauderdale Strikers in 1977 and 1978. He briefly entered management with Telford United, but left the game after he was sacked in December 1980.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{had several}} health problems, {{including}} childhood tuberculous scrofula resulting in deep facial scarring, deafness {{in one ear}} and blindness <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye,</b> gout, testicular cancer, and a stroke in his final year that left him unable to speak; his autopsy indicated that he had pulmonary fibrosis along with cardiac failure probably due to hypertension, a condition then unknown. Johnson displayed signs consistent with several diagnoses, including depression and Tourette syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|In escape learning, a {{behavior}} terminates an (aversive) stimulus. For example, shielding <b>one's</b> <b>eyes</b> from sunlight terminates the (aversive) stimulation of bright light <b>in</b> <b>one's</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] (This {{is an example}} of negative reinforcement, defined above.) Behavior that is maintained by preventing a stimulus is called [...] "avoidance," [...] as, for example, putting on sun glasses before going outdoors. [...] Avoidance behavior raises the so-called [...] "avoidance paradox", for, it may be asked, how can the non-occurrence of a stimulus serve as a reinforcer? This question is addressed by several theories of avoidance (see below).|$|R

5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye,</b> and hard of hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, drank {{a cup of hot}} chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. After a few minutes, his valet heard a loud crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer than any of his English or British predecessors. A {{post-mortem}} revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a {{demyelinating disease}} {{in which the}} insulating covers of nerve cells {{in the brain and}} spinal cord are damaged. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye,</b> muscle weakness, trouble with sensation, or trouble with coordination. MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely; however, permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.|$|E
5|$|Nelson was {{a highly}} {{experienced}} officer who had been blinded <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> during fighting in Corsica in 1794 and subsequently commended for his capture of two Spanish ships of {{the line at the}} Battle of Cape St. Vincent in February 1797. In July 1797, he lost an arm at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and had been forced to return to Britain to recuperate. Returning to the fleet at the Tagus in late April 1798, he was ordered to collect the squadron stationed at Gibraltar and sail for the Ligurian Sea. On 21 May, as Nelson's squadron approached Toulon, it was struck by a fierce gale and Nelson's flagship, HMS Vanguard, lost its topmasts and was almost wrecked on the Corsican coast. The remainder of the squadron was scattered. The ships of the line sheltered at San Pietro Island off Sardinia; the frigates were blown to the west and failed to return.|$|E

5|$|Pressure on {{the part}} of the optic nerve known as the chiasm, which is located above the gland, leads to loss of vision on the outer side of the visual field on both sides, as this {{corresponds}} to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of the optic nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases. Visual acuity is reduced in half, and over 60% have a visual field defect. The visual loss depends on which part of the nerve is affected. If the part of the nerve between the eye and the chiasm is compressed, the result is vision loss <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye.</b> If the part after the chiasm is affected, visual loss on one side of the visual field occurs.|$|E
5|$|After {{fifteen minutes}} of combat, Boston lost its cross-jack yard and by 05:45 had {{suffered}} significant damage to its rigging and sails, rendering the ship significantly less manoeuvrable than Embuscade. At 06:10 the main topmast was knocked over and the mizzen mast badly damaged, and ten minutes later, as he was exhorting his men to greater efforts, a cannonball struck the rail where Captain Courtenay and Royal Marine Lieutenant James Butler were standing. Butler was killed instantly and Courtenay fell to the deck unresponsive, possibly killed. Believing his commander to be dead, Lieutenant John Edwards assumed command and had the bodies thrown overboard {{in an effort to}} prevent his sailors losing morale from the death of their captain. Boston continued to suffer under the heavier guns of the French ship and by 06:40 the mizzen mast was close to collapse and much of the remaining rigging had been shot away. Casualties mounted, with Lieutenant Edwards and Lieutenant Alexander Kerr both badly wounded, the latter blinded <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> and the former struck on the head and briefly rendered unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Ernest was {{the subject}} of more {{allegations}} in 1832, when two young women accused him of trying to ride them down as they walked near Hammersmith. The Duke had not left his grounds at Kew on the day in question, and was able to ascertain that the rider was one of his equerries, who professed not to have seen the women. Nevertheless, newspapers continued to print references to the incident, suggesting that Ernest had done what the women stated, and was cravenly trying to push blame on another. The same year, the Duke sued for libel after a book appeared accusing him of having his valet Neale kill Sellis, and the jury found against the author. Also in 1832, the Cumberlands suffered tragedy, as young Prince George went blind. The Prince had been blind <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> from infancy; an accident at age thirteen took the sight of the other. Ernest had hoped his son might marry Princess Victoria and keep the British and Hanoverian Thrones united, but the handicap made it unlikely George could win Princess Victoria's hand, and raised questions about whether he should succeed in Hanover.|$|E
50|$|Stereopsis, or stereo vision, is {{the visual}} {{blending}} of two similar but not identical images into one, with resulting visual perception of solidity and depth. In the human brain, stereopsis results from complex mechanisms that form a three-dimensional impression by matching each point (or set of points) <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye's</b> view with the equivalent point (or set of points) {{in the other}} eye's view. Using binocular disparity, the brain derives the points' positions in the otherwise inscrutable z-axis (depth).|$|R

5|$|Indonesian {{artillery}} fire continued to rain {{down on the}} camp, wounding several men and sending the defenders into disarray. Sergeant-Major Williams rushed to the headquarters to order the artillery officer to bombard the taken positions before attempting to organise a counterattack himself. Whilst under heavy Indonesian fire, Williams gathered a section of defenders who had taken refuge in a slit trench and led them towards the captured outer positions. A shell landed among the group and wounded half of them, but Williams and the remainder engaged at least thirty Indonesian infantry who had been firing into the base from the trench in vicious hand-to-hand combat and managed to push them from it with minor casualties. Williams them looked to secure the perimeter, but seeing that the Indonesians were massing for a second attack, {{he sat down in}} a vacated machine gun nest and sprayed the new wave of attackers, who attempted to seize the command bunker, with fire. This was not without cost, and Williams was fortunate to have escaped with a single head wound, which nevertheless blinded him <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye,</b> though he did not notice this in the heat of battle. Williams then began to receive supporting rifle fire from other British troops in nearby trenches, as well bombardment from the single remaining mortar and some 105mm artillery emplacements from a nearby camp.|$|E
5|$|Narrow/closed angle {{glaucoma}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} inheritable trait in the breed. It {{is a leading}} cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the eye. If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough, or slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle glaucoma. Symptoms can include redness in the eye, the eye itself looking cloudy, sensitivity to light and the dog may rub at their eye, or even rub it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful. Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited glaucoma appears <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>eye</b> then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually.|$|E

5000|$|The {{metaphor is}} a rather extreme one. The word {{translated}} as mote or speck can refer to a tiny splinter or piece of sawdust, or colloquially to any minute object. The word translated as beam refers to a log or a rafter such as would hold up {{the roof of a}} house. A rafter is a difficult thing to get <b>in</b> <b>ones</b> <b>eye,</b> but it functions as a humorous and hyperbolic metaphor for an extreme flaw. The metaphor comes from woodworking and is often seen as rooted in Jesus traditional employment as a carpenter.|$|R
