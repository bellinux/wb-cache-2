60|$|Mr. Jack Hamlin did {{not lose}} much time on the road from Wingdam to Sacramento. His rapid driving, his dust bespattered vehicle, and the {{exhausted}} condition of his horse on arrival, excited but little comment from those who knew his habits, and for other criticism he had a supreme indifference. He was prudent enough, however, to leave his horse at a stable on the outskirts, and having reconstructed his toilet at a neighbouring hotel, he walked briskly toward the address given him by Maxwell. When he reached {{the corner of the}} street and was within a few paces of the massive shining <b>door</b> <b>plate</b> of Madame Eclair's Pensionnat, he stopped with a sudden ejaculation, and after a moment's hesitation, turned on his heel deliberately and began to retrace his steps.|$|E

Due to the long exposure times involved, however, Talbot included only one portrait, The Ladder (Plate XIV).

40|$|In {{this paper}} a vision {{system for the}} {{recognition}} of <b>door</b> number <b>plates</b> in office buildings is presented. The motivation {{for the development of}} such a system is the improvement of other methods for the position update of mobile robots, which are mainly based on measurements stemming from distance-sensors. Furthermore, the recognition of <b>door</b> <b>plates</b> can be used for absolute positioning of mobile robots as well as an universal method for automatic generation of environment maps in office buildings, hospitals, etc. The whole system has been developed using a combination of classical vision algorithms with neural networks to ensure high flexibility and robustness of the system. The achieved results show that the correct recognition of the <b>door</b> <b>plates</b> is ensured in real time even under changing environment conditions...|$|R

50|$|After {{a series}} of moves, she was {{eventually}} returned to steam on the Severn Valley Railway, where she remained {{for a number of}} years in operational but non-mainline condition. With the society wishing to make more use of the locomotive, she was moved to the European gauge Nene Valley Railway in Peterborough, where she was also fitted with an air-brake compressor, and was based there from 1980-2000. Britannia made her return to the main line on 27 July 1991, successfully working enthusiast trips until 1997, and was featured in an episode of London's Burning.With an expired mainline boiler certificate, due to the high cost of refurbishment, the locomotive was sold to Pete Waterman in 2000. Stored at Waterman's workshops at the Crewe Heritage Centre, after initial assessment the amount of work resulted in Waterman selling her to Jeremy Hosking. The locomotive underwent restoration at Crewe which involved a newly refurbished cab, a new smoke box and major work on the boiler; replacement steel sides, new crown stays, new front section barrel section, new steel and copper tubeplate, repairs and patches to <b>door</b> <b>plate</b> and major work to copper firebox.|$|E
5000|$|Two other minor left-wing {{parliamentary}} parties, the Together (Együtt) and the Dialogue for Hungary (PM), and {{a liberal}} conservative extra-parliamentary force, the Modern Hungary Movement (MoMa) announced to campaign jointly and urged their voters {{to stay away}} from the referendum. On 1 September, the party leaders presented their joint poster which showed a couple sitting on sofa who giving the finger to the government's campaign message on TV. [...] "For a stupid question, this is the answer!" [...] and [...] "Who stay at home, votes for Europe" [...] slogans were appeared in that poster. MoMa president Lajos Bokros told [...] "there is no right answer to a nefarious question". Együtt leader Viktor Szigetvári said [...] "we are disgusted from what Viktor Orbán is doing with this country". According to Dialogue for Hungary co-chair Gergely Karácsony, [...] "this referendum is one of the biggest political swindles in recent decades". He added, the government, beside their money, is trying to steal people's [...] "soul" [...] and [...] "benevolence" [...] too. Formerly the Together said [...] "Orbán's populist politics is resulting a sliding and unthrifty Hungary". According to the party, the only alternative are the [...] "peace and European cooperation". The PM considered the referendum as a [...] "gigantic scam" [...] which serves only the communication and policy goals of Fidesz. The party added [...] "if Hungary accepts EU aids and sums, must be involved too in the solution of common problems". The PM intended to organize a protest to the day of the referendum, but after a legal complaint by Fidesz MP Gergely Gulyás, the National Election Committee (NVB) found it unlawful, as according to the election law, a rally cannot hold on the day of the referendum. As a result, the party, alongside MSZP, which also canceled its planned rally named [...] "Free Europe Day" [...] after the decision, protested in front of the NVI headquarters because of its presumptive pro-government political decisions. Co-leader Karácsony noted how ironic that International Day of Non-Violence and Gandhi Jayanti are observed on October 2, the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. After that Gergely Karácsony and MSZP chairman Gyula Molnár covered the sign of the National Election Office with a [...] "Fidesz Election Office" [...] <b>door</b> <b>plate.</b> During a MoMa protest on 25 September, a young speaker said [...] "The House Speaker Kövér and Zsolt Bayer Fidesz-ally journalist, he is known for harsh tone articles are the threat to our culture, and not the Islam".|$|E

40|$|The {{continued}} miniaturization in computing {{and wireless}} communication {{is about to}} make informationally enhanced environments become a reality. Already today, devices like a notebook computer or a personal digital assistent (PDA) can easily connect to the Internet via IEEE 802. 11 networks (WaveLAN) or similar technologies provided at so-called hot-spots. In the near future, even smaller devices can join a wireless network to exchange status information or send and receive commands. In this paper, we present sample uses of a generic Bluetooth component that we have developed {{and that has been}} successfully integrated into various mininature devices to transmit sensor data or exchange control commands. The use of standard protocols like TCP/IP, Obex, and HTTP simplifies the use of those devices with conventional devices (notebook, PDA, cell-phone) without even requiring special drivers or applications for these devices. While such scenarios have already often been dreamt of, we are able to present a working solution based on small and cost-effective standard elements. We describe two applications that illustrate the power this approach in the broad area of e-commerce, e-learning, and e-government: the BlueWand, a small, pen-like device that can control Bluetooth devices in its vincinity by simple gestures, and a <b>door</b> <b>plate</b> that can display messages that are posted to it e. g. by a Bluetooth PDA.

50|$|During this period, {{many of the}} Gate Stock cars on the Central {{line had}} been {{converted}} to air-door operation by the Union Construction Co., which was based at Feltham. Plans were briefly formulated to convert the Gate Stock on the Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines, but analysis showed {{that the cost of}} building a new car was only slightly more than the cost of converting an old one, and so an order for 182 new cars was placed. They were known as the 1927 Feltham Stock, although the <b>door</b> <b>plates</b> carried the date 1928, and they were not delivered until 1929 and 1930. The lightweight construction caused problems in later years, when the seat risers and body bolsters developed fractures. With the batch of cars built by MCWF and fitted with BTH equipment, these vehicles enabled Gate Stock to be withdrawn from the Piccadilly line in June 1929, and from the Bakerloo line on 1 January 1930.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{image of}} the church dates to 1813; the ink drawing, by a jacket maker and choir singer, shows a tall wooden fence and two cupolas apparently of stone. The same year, Calinic of Cernica was ordained a priest there. The church's first record book is from 1844. It mentions that the attached cells were occupied by priests as well as poor people, orphans and widows. It notes that the iconostasis is of wood, the murals old, the seven windows framed in stone, the wooden <b>door</b> <b>plated</b> with iron, and the cupolas and roof made of rather old fir boards. A similar work from 1850 reveals that the domes were coated in tin, indicating the structure was growing weaker {{in the wake of}} the 1838 earthquake. In 1869, Italian painter Domenico Preziosi executed a fine watercolor of the church; however, by around 1880, it was in a deplorable state. Repairs were carried out in 1883, but these only further damaged the structure.|$|R
