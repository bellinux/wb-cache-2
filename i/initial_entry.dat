The new 100th Division (Operational Support) teaches soldiers subjects from military intelligence, signal corps, civil affairs/psychological operations and health services.|$|E
5|$|They {{returned}} {{to assist in}} the major attack on the fortifications planned for 18 March. British ships made the <b>initial</b> <b>entry</b> into the Dardanelles, but the French ships passed through them to engage the forts at closer range. Gaulois was hit twice during this bombardment, but only one shell did any significant damage. It hit just above the waterline on the starboard bow and pushed in the armour plates below the waterline and opened up a hole through which water flooded in. Little could be done to staunch the inflow and the ship's captain decided to head for the Rabbit Islands, north of Tenedos, where he could beach his ship for temporary repairs. Escorted by Charlemagne in case she foundered en route, Gaulois managed to reach the islands. After temporary repairs, the ship was refloated and sailed for Toulon, escorted by Suffren. They encountered heavy weather en route and emergency repairs had {{to be made in the}} Bay of Navarin. She made Toulon without further incident where the ship was refitted and extensively modified to improve her stability, returning to the Dardanelles in July.|$|E

25|$|Blackjack can {{be played}} in tournament form. Players start with an equal numbers of chips; {{the goal is to}} finish among the top chip-holders. Depending on the number of competitors, tournaments may be held over several rounds, with one or two players {{qualifying}} from each table after a set number of deals to meet the qualifiers from the other tables in the next round. Another tournament format, Elimination Blackjack, drops the lowest-stacked player from the table at pre-determined points in the tournament. Good strategy for blackjack tournaments can differ from non-tournament strategy because of the added dimension of choosing the amount to be wagered. As in poker tournaments, players pay the casino an <b>initial</b> <b>entry</b> fee to participate in a tournament, and re-buys are sometimes permitted.|$|E
25|$|Eventually a chain {{will come}} to an end, usually with a new entrant into the system or when the last unit in a chain is abandoned, merged, or destroyed. This can involve a new {{employee}} recruit or a housing unit on market for the first time, or when {{a house in the}} chain is torn down, left empty, or the duties of a vacant job are distributed among other employees. A vacancy chain is simply the sequence of moves that a vacancy makes from <b>initial</b> <b>entry</b> into a system to final termination. The distribution of material resources and social positions through vacancy chain processes requires that the things distributed possess a number of abstract qualities. These qualities include that the resource units in question are reusable, discrete, identifiable, and utilized by one individual or social group at a time.|$|E
25|$|Germaine Dulac {{was born}} in Amiens, France into an upper-middle-class family of a career {{military}} officer. Since her father's job required the family to frequently move between small garrison towns, Germaine was sent {{to live with her}} grandmother in Paris. She soon became interested in art and studied music, painting, and theater. Following the death of her parents, Dulac moved to Paris and combined her growing interests in socialism and feminism with a career in journalism. In 1905 she married Louis-Albert Dulac, an agricultural engineer who also came from an upper-class family. Four years later she began writing for La Française, a feminist magazine edited by Jane Misme where she eventually became the drama critic. Dulac also found time to work on the editorial staff of La Fronde, a radical feminist journal of the time. She also began to pursue her interest in still photography, which preceded her <b>initial</b> <b>entry</b> into filmmaking. Dulac and her husband divorced in 1920.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: IEEE 802. 16 {{basically}} {{designed to}} provide more security as compared to other wireless networks. It provides many security features to protect {{the information in the}} network as well as to protect the network from unauthorized access, still it vulnerable to many attacks. The process, where attack or threat is possible, is the <b>initial</b> network <b>entry</b> process of IEEE 802. 16. This is because many of the MAC management messages, which are used in this process, are not encrypted. The <b>initial</b> network <b>entry</b> process is very important as this is the first gate to establish connection between MS and BS. The solution to this problem provided by some paper is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, but the algorithm we are going to use here is elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. This paper provides the solution to the <b>initial</b> network <b>entry</b> process by using elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm as it is faster than the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. Hence it also improves the performance of IEEE 802. 16...|$|R
