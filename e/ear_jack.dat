The transmitter of the proposed system is constructed using visible light LHDs, in which current fed to the LEDs is modulated and encoded with audio information or messages. The audio system provides audio signal transmission in a free space optical link. The receiver, combined with an <b>ear</b> <b>jack,</b> is located at some distance from the transmitters. The handheld receiver is designed to demodulate the optically transmitted audio information and reproduce the messages with the car jack. For modulating emission of T,HDs, an oscillator is used to vary the frequency of on/off periods of the LCDs. The frequency of flicker is high enough to be indistinguishable by human eye and hence the LRDs appear to be constantly illuminated. © 1999 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
5000|$|A {{review in}} the April 20, 1937, issue of the trade {{publication}} Radio Daily commented: [...] "Berch offers an enjoyable program of singing and chatting that is well geared {{to appeal to the}} feminine <b>ears.</b> <b>Jack's</b> style is friendly, and he slips in the commercial remarks in a manner that makes them easy to take." [...] Another comment in the same publication four months later said, [...] "The singing of Berch is particularly well designed to give the day a sunny sendoff." [...] On the other hand, a 1943 comment in the trade publication Billboard described Berch's program as [...] "strictly a long quarter-hour of flimsy whimsy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{something}} like!" [...] Jim roared {{at the top}} of his voice into <b>Jack's</b> <b>ear.</b> Even then his words could scarcely be heard.|$|R
6000|$|... "'She's gone riding,' I {{whisper in}} my bronc's <b>ear,</b> 'with Birdstone <b>Jack,</b> the hired mule from Sheep Man's Canada. Did you get that, old Leather-and-Gallops?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Farmer Weatherbeard changed {{himself into}} a hare, which {{scratched}} and scraped about in the fireplace after the ring until the ashes were up to its <b>ears.</b> But <b>Jack</b> changed {{himself into a}} fox, and bit the hare's head off, and if Farmer Weatherbeard was possessed by the evil one all was now over with him.(25) ...|$|R
60|$|With their {{overcoats}} buttoned up {{tightly and}} their caps pulled well down over their <b>ears,</b> Gif, <b>Jack</b> {{and the twins}} sallied forth {{in the direction of}} the woodshed, which was about fifty yards away. They had all they could do to make any progress, and when the shed was gained they were almost winded.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{answered}} Ritter, and {{the hold}} of each youth was loosened. But as they broke the bully tried to land his fist on <b>Jack's</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Standard Class {{carriages}} {{have improved}} passenger seating and leg room. They also have electronic visual and audible passenger information systems, electronic seat reservation displays, CCTV, {{air conditioning and}} additional space for luggage. Power sockets are supplied on all Standard and Citygold Class coaches. Citygold cars have ergonomic, electronically adjustable seats, multi-channel <b>ear</b> phone <b>jack</b> sockets and individual overhead lighting.|$|R
60|$|Thus encouraged, Ritter leaped in {{and another}} blow landed on <b>Jack's</b> <b>ear.</b> He {{was a bit}} dazed, but shut his teeth hard and ducked under Ritter's arm. Then both sparred for an opening, {{circling}} around the gymnasium floor once more, the crowd of cadets around them growing larger and larger.|$|R
6000|$|The cry rang in <b>Jack's</b> <b>ears,</b> and {{his knees}} smote together, and {{conscience}} cried upon him; {{and yet he}} was strengthened, and there woke in his bones the lust of that enchanter's blood. [...] "If the gyves are to fall," [...] said he, [...] "I must go through with this, and when I get home I shall find my uncle dancing." ...|$|R
6000|$|The cry rang in <b>Jack's</b> <b>ears,</b> and {{his soul}} was darkened; but now rage came to him. [...] "I {{have done what}} I dare not think upon," [...] said he. [...] "I will go to an end with it, or perish. And when I get home, I pray God {{this may be a}} dream, and I may find my father dancing." ...|$|R
2500|$|The first dog {{called a}} Kelpie {{was a black}} and tan female pup with floppy <b>ears</b> bought by <b>Jack</b> Gleeson about 1872 from a litter born on Warrock Station near Casterton, owned by George Robertson, a Scot. This dog was named kelpie after the kelpie, a mythological shape {{shifting}} water spirit of Celtic folklore. Legend has it that [...] "Kelpie" [...] was sired by a dingo, {{but there is little}} evidence for or against this. In later years she was referred to as [...] "(Gleeson's) Kelpie", to differentiate her from [...] "(King's) Kelpie", her daughter.|$|R
5000|$|Netherland Dwarf has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, El Vez of {{short of the}} week gave film the positive review, stating: [...] "Netherland Dwarf proves once again that sometimes {{all you need is}} a hint of emotional resonance to make a captivating and moving short." [...] TGI Film wrote in their review of film, [...] "One of the great things about Netherland Dwarf is the remarkable quality that we so rarely see in short films." [...] Critic Tara Kenny of portable.tv lauded the film for being [...] "simple, sad, sweet and beautiful" [...] she also added, [...] "The emotional resonance of Netherland Dwarf lies in the universal relevance of the familial struggles at its core. With his sweet attentiveness and single-minded desire to own Stampy, the floppy <b>eared</b> bunny, <b>Jack</b> Egan as Harry takes the viewer back to a time when whether to invest in a Hollilop or Netherland dwarf breed of rabbit was easily the most important decision of your lifetime." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{stage is}} a small clinic in the suburbs, {{in a world in}} which humans with cat-and dog <b>ears</b> are commonplace. <b>Jack,</b> the protagonist and a dog-man, works as the {{assistant}} for Dr. Crane, the head doctor of a secluded animal clinic where various cat-girls are being treated. Jack has no memory of his life before coming to the clinic, and he works for Dr. Crane to repay her kindness after she took him in. However, as the only male in the clinic, a certain serious role was imposed: Jack is to have sexual intercourse with the patients to cure their regular symptoms caused by an illness called [...] "DOTES".|$|R
5000|$|Richard Holmes, Coleridge's 20th-century biographer, {{points out}} that, in Coleridge's 1796 collection, [...] "The poem {{which had the}} most popular impact {{remained}} the controversial 'To a Young Jack Ass'." [...] The poem inspired James Gillray to poke fun at Coleridge, William Godwin, and Robert Southey by depicting them with the <b>ears</b> of a <b>jack</b> ass in a caricature titled [...] "New Morality" [...] in the July 1798 Anti-Jacobin Magazine. Likewise, James and Horace Smith parodied the poem in a piece called [...] "Play house Musings". George Gordon Byron would mention the Gillray image in his English Bards and Scotch Renewers series later. Of the criticism, Coleridge was not bothered by anything except Gillray's description under the illustration that contained a negative biographical description, claiming that Coleridge was a deist while at Cambridge and that he left England and his family to explore the world.|$|R
2500|$|In one of WCW's {{most brutal}} matches of all time, Cactus faced Vader in a Texas Death match at Halloween Havoc. Race won the match for Vader {{by using a}} cattle prod on Cactus, {{knocking}} him out. The level of violence involved in this feud caused WCW to refuse to book Cactus Jack against Vader on a pay-per-view again. On March 16, 1994, during a WCW European tour, Foley and Big Van Vader {{had one of the}} most infamous matches in wrestling history in Munich, Germany. Foley began a hangman—a planned move where a wrestler's head is tangled between the top two ring ropes. [...] Foley freed himself from the ropes and fell out of the ring. [...] When Foley re-entered the ring the two wrestlers began trading blows. [...] During this time, Vader reached up and grabbed Foley's ear, and ripped it off. [...] The two men continued wrestling as the referee picked up the ear and gave it to the ring announcer. [...] Vader claimed for years after that the ear had come off during the botched Hangman maneuver, however in a WWE Network video, Vader admits that after seeing footage that he had indeed removed Foley's <b>ear.</b> Cactus <b>Jack</b> and Kevin Sullivan were scheduled to win the tag team titles at Slamboree in 1994. Foley had to choose between reattaching his ear or wrestling in the pay-per-view and winning the titles. Foley chose to wrestle and won his only championship in WCW. Later on, Foley was frustrated by WCW's reluctance to work a storyline around losing his ear.|$|R

6000|$|Old Mother Nature laughed right out. [...] "No, Peter," [...] she replied. [...] "It wouldn't {{be called}} a long tail by any other animal, but for a member of your family it really is long, and when White-tailed Jack is running he {{switches}} it from side to side. His hind legs are very long and powerful, and he can make a single jump of twenty feet without half trying. Not even Old Man Coyote can catch him in a straightaway race. You think Jumper's ears are long, Peter, but they are short compared to the <b>ears</b> of White-tailed <b>Jack.</b> Not only are his ears long, {{but they are very}} big. When he squats in his form and lays his ears back they reach way over his shoulders. Like {{the other members of the}} Hare family he doesn't use holes in the ground or hollow logs. He trusts to his long legs and to his wonderful speed to escape from his enemies. Among the latter are Howler the Wolf, Old Man Coyote, Eagles, Hawks and Owls. He is so big that he would make five or six of you, Peter." ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently the {{confused}} noise {{seemed to get}} louder, then a distinct rumble was heard, and Jack felt with delight that a train of waggons was approaching. Then he saw far along the gallery a light swinging, {{as the man who}} bore it walked ahead of the horse. The water in the little pools between the sleepers reflected it in a score of little lines of light. Now he could hear the hollow splashing sound of the horses' hoofs, and prepared to answer to the shout of [...] "door" [...] by pulling at the string beside him. When the light came within twenty yards it changed its direction; he heard the grating of the wheels against the points, and saw that the waggons were going up the other road. There upon a siding they came to a stop, and a minute or two later a number of full waggons were brought down by another horse. A few words were exchanged by the drivers, but <b>Jack's</b> <b>ear,</b> unaccustomed to the echoes of a mine, could not catch what they said; then the first man hitched his horse on to the full waggons, and started for the shaft, while the other with the empties went up the road to the workings.|$|R
