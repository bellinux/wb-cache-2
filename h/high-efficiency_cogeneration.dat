40|$|Basing on {{the first}} and second law of {{thermodynamics}} the fundamental trends in the Polish energy policy are analysed, including the aspects of environmental protection. The thermodynamical improvement of real processes (reduction of exergy losses) is the main way leading to an improvement of the effectivity of energy consumption. If the exergy loss is economically not justified, we have to do with an error from the viewpoint of the second law analysis. The paper contains a thermodynamical analysis of the ratio of final and primary energy, as well as the analysis of the thermo-ecological cost and index of sustainable development concerning primary energy. Analyses of thermo-ecological costs concerning electricity and centralized heat production have been also carried out. The effect of increasing the share of <b>high-efficiency</b> <b>cogeneration</b> has been analyzed, too. Attention has been paid to an improved efficiency of the transmission and distribution of electricity, which is of special importance from the viewpoint of the second law analysis.

40|$|District heating (DH), an {{important}} source of domestic heat for a number of EU Member States, is often praised as an efficient, clean and cheap technology with significant potential for carbon emissions mitigation. In Central and Eastern Europe, DH systems often perform poorly because of inherited inefficiencies and heat costs are a burden the household budgets of domestic users. In that context, significant energy cost savings and additional co-benefits can be realised through a large scale, deep retrofit of buildings connected to DH, especially if the conditions under which DH is served are also improved. In the long-term, however, the future role of the DH industry may to be reevaluated if nearly-zero energy buildings become the norm, as presently legislated in the EU, and consequently the demand for domestic heat is drastically reduced. 1. Introduction: district heating (DH) in an EU context 1. 1. Diverging perspectives in an evolving EU District heating (DH) has been often celebrated as a sustainable and environmentally friendly way of providing heat to buildings (IEA/OECD, 2009).

40|$|The {{performances}} of two natural gas small-scale trigeneration plants are {{dealt with in}} the paper. The two plants are part of a new cogeneration and trigeneration system laboratory at the Politecnico di Torino (Turin, Italy), which will be set up and exploited for scientific and technical purposes. The first plant has 126 / 220 / 210 kW electrical, heating and cooling capacities, respectively, and it is characterized by an innovative internal combustion engine (ICE) that has been coupled to a liquid LiCl-water desiccant cooling system. The other plant has 100 / 145 / 98 kW electrical, heating and cooling capacities and is composed of a micro gas turbine, coupled to a LiBr-Water absorption chiller. The aim of the paper was comparing the {{performances of}} the two plants from an energetic and economic point of view; the Primary Energy Savings are calculated for both installations through a commonly accepted methodology proposed by the European Union, and through another methodology, reported in literature, which seems more suitable to describe the energetic performances of trigeneration plants. The savings calculated with this second procedure result to be lower than those of the European Union methodology; moreover, the ICE installation always denotes higher performances with respect to the microturbine. From the economic point of view, it is evident that a fuel tax reduction for <b>high-efficiency</b> <b>cogeneration</b> plants is an essential contribution for the support and development of these system...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{prepared}} {{in support of}} the implementation of Article 11 of the Cogeneration Directive (2004 / 8 /EC), which states that the Commission should periodically report on progress in implementing the Directive and its effects in terms of promotion of high efficiency cogeneration. It analyses the potential for <b>high-efficiency</b> <b>cogeneration</b> in the EU and the progress towards realising that potential. The analysis is based on Member States’ national reports, the templates with quantification of national potentials (as submitted by Member States in response to the Commission’s request), external scenario data and technology parameters, and internal Commission analyses. It reviews the progress in transposing the Directive into Member States’ law, which –as the analysis shows – has been generally achieved. Second, it reviews {{the extent to which the}} Directive mandated reporting rules and procedures have been implemented; this is generally achieved but the process has suffered lengthy delays and six Member States still have one or more reports outstanding. It compares the effect of the different support schemes promoting CHP. The aim of this analysis is to pinpoint which kind of supporting measures have been more effective in promoting CHP It contains a summary of a Commission report that reviews the Reference Values. It assesses the impact of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). It presents a number of recommendations that should be considered for improving the effectiveness of the Directive.

40|$|Micro Combined Heat and Power (micro-CHP) {{generators}} {{combine the}} benefits of the <b>high-efficiency</b> <b>cogeneration</b> technology and microgeneration and is being promoted as a means of lowering greenhouse gas emissions by decentralizing the power network. Life Cycle Assessment of energy systems is becoming a part of decision making in the energy industry, helping manufacturers promote their low carbon devices, and consumers choose the most environmentally friendly options. This report summarizes a preliminary life-cycle energy and carbon analysis of a wall-hung gas-powered domestic micro-CHP device that is commercially available across Europe. Combining a very efficient condensing boiler with a Stirling engine, the device can deliver enough heat to cover the needs of a typical household (up to 24 kW) while generating power (up to 1 kW) that can be used locally or sold to the grid. Assuming an annual heat production of 20 MWh, the study has calculated the total embodied energy and carbon emissions over a 15 years operational lifetime at 1606 GJ and 90 tonnes of CO 2 respectively. Assuming that such a micro CHP device replaces the most efficient gas-powered condensing boiler for domestic heat production, and the power generated substitutes electricity from the grid, the potential energy and carbon savings are around 5000 MJ/year and 530 kg CO 2 /year respectively. This implies a payback period of the embodied energy and carbon at 1. 32 - 2. 32 and 0. 75 - 1. 35 years respectively. Apart from the embodied energy and carbon and the respective savings, additional key outcomes of the study are the evaluation of the energy intensive phases of the device’s life cycle and the exploration of potential improvements...|$|E
40|$|Cooling {{demand in}} {{buildings}} is globally increasing, therefore developing more efficient cooling systems {{is important for}} the sustainability of European cities. Directive 2012 / 27 /EU of the European Parliament and of the council on energy efficiency states: “Member States should carry out a comprehensive assessment of the potential for <b>high-efficiency</b> <b>cogeneration</b> and district heating and cooling”. The EU project INDIGO is investigating this issue considering also the economic efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources. In a district cooling system different kinds of cooling production can be combined. E. g., the use of absorption chillers with waste heat or through the solar cooling or the use of free cooling (generally the heat is rejected to seas, lakes, rivers or waterways) offer the possibility of a more sustainable way of cooling. Controlling those systems in an efficient way is a complex problem (consider that the cooling demand is much more difficult to predict than the heat demand, particularly the peaks, and sources such as the solar energy and the waste heat are not predetermined by the designers). The main results of INDIGO will be the development of: - predictive controllers (responsible for obtaining the HVAC systems set-points and based on component dynamic thermos-fluid models, some of them also including embedded self-learning algorithms); - system management algorithms (focused on energy efficiency maximization or energy cost minimization); - an open-source planning tool (based on design and performance parameters as well as simulation and optimisation results; LCA framework will be used as a method for both economic feasibility and climate impact assessment). To validate the results, the consortium is analysing case studies, both through energy modelling and through on-site observations and measurements. The present paper focuses mainly on the development of dynamic energy models and on their use {{in the context of the}} project...|$|E
40|$|The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), adopted on 4 December 2012, {{establishes}} {{a set of}} binding measures to help the EU reach its 20 % energy efficiency target by 2020. Under the Directive, all EU countries are required to use energy more efficiently at all stages of the energy chain from its production to its final consumption. Member States were required to translate the EED into national law by 5 June 2014. The EED will repeal the existing Cogeneration Directive (2004 / 8 /EC) and the Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive (2006 / 32 /EC) as of 5 June 2014. Article 14 (5) of the EED requires Member States to ensure that thermal electricity generation installations and industrial installations exceeding 20 MWth, carry out a cost-benefit analysis when they are planned or substantially refurbished to assess whether the use of <b>high-efficiency</b> <b>cogeneration,</b> the connection to a district heating or cooling network or other means of waste heat recovery would be cost-effective. The obligation to carry-out a cost-benefit analysis also applies to new district heating and cooling networks, when those are planned or when an energy production installation with a capacity exceeding 20 MWth is planned or substantially refurbished within those networks, {{in order to assess}} whether the utilisation of waste heat from a nearby industrial installation is cost-effective. If the benefits exceed the costs, the options analysed in the cost-benefit analysis must be included in the authorisation or permit criteria. The cost-benefit analysis has to be in accordance with the general methodological principles set out in Part 2 of Annex IX. A possible methodology for conducting a Cost Benefit-Analysis (CBA) in accordance with Article 14 (5) and Part 2 of Annex IX of the Energy Efficiency Directive is presented here. The methodology takes into account the Guidance note prepared by the Commission for the implementation of Article 14, including the carrying out of the cost-benefit analysis by individual installations and district heating and cooling networks.
