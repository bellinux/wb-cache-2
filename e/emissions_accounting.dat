50|$|Despite its {{advantages}} consumption-based <b>emissions</b> <b>accounting</b> {{is not without}} its drawbacks. These were highlighted above and in Table 1 and are principally: greater uncertainty, greater complexity requiring more data not always available, and requiring greater international collaboration.|$|E
50|$|Consumption-based <b>emissions</b> <b>accounting</b> may {{be deemed}} {{superior}} as it incorporates embodied emissions currently {{ignored by the}} UNFCCC preferred production-based accounting. Other key advantages include: extending mitigation options, covering more global emissions through increased participation, and inherently encompassing policies such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).|$|E
50|$|The CDM is a {{flexible}} mechanism set {{up under the}} Kyoto Protocol {{with the aim of}} creating ‘Carbon Credits’ for trade in trading schemes such as the EU ETS. Despite coming under heavy criticism (see Evans, p134-135; and Burniaux et al., p58-65), the theory is that as the marginal cost of environmental abatement is lower in non-Annex B countries a scheme like this will promote technology transfer from Annex B to non-Annex B countries resulting in cheaper emissions reductions. Because under consumption-based <b>emissions</b> <b>accounting</b> a country is responsible for the emissions caused by its imports, {{it is important for the}} importing country to encourage good environmental behaviour and promote the cleanest production technologies available in the exporting country. Therefore, unlike the Kyoto Protocol where the CDM was added later, consumption-based <b>emissions</b> <b>accounting</b> inherently promotes clean development in the foreign country because of the way it allocates emissions. One loophole that remains relevant is ‘carbon colonialism’ whereby developed countries do not mitigate the underlying problem but simply continue to increase consumption offsetting this by exploiting the abatement potential of developing countries.|$|E

50|$|Peters and Hertwich {{completed}} a MRIO study to calculate emissions embodied {{in international trade}} {{using data from the}} 2001 Global Trade Analysis Program (GTAP). After manipulation, although their numbers are slightly more conservative (EU 14%; OECD 3%; BRIC 16%; RoW 6%) than Boitier the same trend is evident - developed countries are CO2 consumers and developing countries are CO2 producers. This trend is seen across the literature and supporting the use of consumption-based <b>emissions</b> <b>accounting</b> in policy-making decisions.|$|E
50|$|The two methodologies of <b>emissions</b> <b>{{accounting}}</b> {{begin to}} expose their key differences. Production-based accounting is transparently consistent with GDP, whereas consumption-based accounting (more complex and uncertain) {{is consistent with}} national consumption and trade. However, the most important {{difference is that the}} later covers global emissions - including those ‘embodied’ emissions that are omitted in production-based accounting - and offers globally based mitigation options. Thus the attribution of emissions embodied in international trade is the crux of the matter.|$|E
50|$|Which {{technique}} is applied by policymakers is fundamental as each can generate {{a very different}} NEI.

The application of production-based <b>emissions</b> <b>accounting</b> is currently favoured in policy terms, although much of the literature favours consumption-based accounting. The former method is criticised in the literature principally for its inability to allocate emissions embodied in international trade/transportation and the potential for carbon leakage.|$|E

50|$|Greenhouse gas <b>emissions</b> <b>accounting</b> is {{a method}} of calculating the amount of {{greenhouse}} gases (GHG) emitted by a region in a given time-scale. A National Emissions Inventory (NEI) measuring a country’s GHG emissions in a year is required by the UNFCCC to provide a benchmark for the country’s emission reductions, and subsequently to evaluate international climate policies such as the Kyoto protocol (although the original has now expired, extensions have been agreed) as well as regional climate policies such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).|$|E
50|$|Measuring a country’s GHG {{emissions}} {{is critical}} to combat climate change. It is clear that production-based <b>emissions</b> <b>accounting,</b> the currently favoured method for policy-making, significantly underestimates the level of GHG emitted by excluding emissions embodied in international trade. Implementing consumption-based accounting which includes such emissions, developed countries take {{a greater share of}} GHG emissions and consequently the low level of emissions commitments for developing countries are not as important. Not only does consumption-based accounting encompass global emissions, it promotes good environmental behaviour and increases participation by reducing competitiveness.|$|E
50|$|Land {{footprint}} is a consumption-based indicator, i.e. {{it looks}} at the resources needed to create a final product, or by an organisation or country, wherever {{they are in the}} world.

50|$|Consumption-based <b>emissions</b> <b>accounting</b> has {{an equally}} {{established}} methodology using Input-Output Tables. These “display the interconnection between different sectors {{of production and}} allow for a tracing of the production and consumption in an economy” and were originally created for national economies. However, as production has become increasingly international and the import/export market between nations has flourished, Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) models have been developed. The unique feature of MRIO is allowing a product to be traced across its production cycle, “quantifying the contributions {{to the value of}} the product from different economic sectors in various countries represented in the model. It hence offers a description of the global supply chains of products consumed”. From this, assuming regional- and industry-specific data for CO2 emissions per unit of output are available, the total amount of emissions for the product can be calculated, and therefore the amount of emissions the final consumer is allocated responsibility for.|$|E
40|$|Estimating CO 2 {{emissions}} {{resulting from}} the non-energy use of fossil fuels is not straightforward, because part of the carbon is released quickly as CO 2 whereas another part is first embodied in organic chemicals. To contribute to a more accurate non-energy useCO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>accounting,</b> the Non-energy use <b>Emission</b> <b>Accounting</b> Tables (NEAT) model has been developed, which is in this paper applied to the Netherlands for the time period 1993 – 1999. For this period, we estimate the total non-energy use in CO 2 equivalents in the Netherlands to vary between 26. 1 and 30. 2 Mt CO 2. Of this total, 4. 6 – 6. 6 Mt CO 2 is emitted in industrial processes and during product use. The remainder is stored, resulting in an overall storage fraction of approximately 80 %. Given the uncertainties involved, we cannot distinguish clear trends for the years of study. We show that the definition of non-energy use has {{a significant effect on}} the calculated storage fractions. The carbon storage according to the Dutch national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventory is 5 – 9 MtCO 2 lower compared to theNEAT result. As a result, total fossil CO 2 emissions (including those from fossil fuel combustion) according to the national inventory are higher by the same amount, which is 3 – 5 % of the total Dutch emissions. The difference is among other things caused by difficulties associated with the direct use of non-energy use figures from the Dutch energy statistics for CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>accounting.</b> We recommend improving the Dutch GHG emission inventory making use of the results of this study...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} local biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) emissions from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). An improved land cover and emission factor database was developed to estimate Hong Kong emissions using MEGAN, a BVOC emission model developed by Guenther et al. (2006). Field surveys of plant species composition and laboratory measurements of emission factors were combined with other data to improve existing land cover and emission factor data. The BVOC emissions from Hong Kong were calculated for 12 consecutive years from 1995 to 2006. For the year 2006, the total annual BVOC emissions were determined to be 12, 400  metric tons or 9. 82  ×  109  g C (BVOC carbon). Isoprene <b>emission</b> <b>accounts</b> for 72 %, monoterpene <b>emissions</b> <b>account</b> for 8 %, and other VOCs <b>emissions</b> <b>account</b> for the remaining 20 %. As expected, seasonal variation results in a higher emission {{in the summer and}} a lower emission in the winter, with emission predominantly in day time. A high emission of isoprene occurs for regions, such as Lowest Forest-NT North, dominated by broadleaf trees. The spatial variation of total BVOC is similar to the isoprene spatial variation due to its high contribution. The year to year variability in emissions due to weather was small over the twelve-year period (- 1. 4 %, 2006 to 1995 trendline), but an increasing trend in the annual variation due to an increase in forest land cover can be observed (+ 7 %, 2006 to 1995 trendline). The results of this study demonstrate the importance of accurate land cover inputs for biogenic emission models and indicate that land cover change should be considered for these models. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|To {{contribute}} to a more accurate accounting of CO 2 emissions originating from the non-energy use of fossil fuels, the non-energy use <b>emission</b> <b>accounting</b> tables (NEAT) model has been developed.

The model generates estimates for total non-energy use, carbon storage in synthetic organic chemicals and CO 2 emissions resulting from non-energy use that are independent from energy statistics. This paper describes the basic methodology of the NEAT model.

50|$|As production-based <b>emissions</b> <b>accounting</b> is {{currently}} favoured in policy terms, its methodology is well established. Emissions are calculated not directly but indirectly from fossil fuel usage and other relevant {{processes such as}} industry and agriculture according to 2006 guidelines issued by the IPCC for GHG reporting. The guidelines span numerous methodologies dependent {{on the level of}} sophistication (Tiers 1-3 in Table 2). The simplest methodology combines the extent of a human activity with a coefficient quantifying the emissions from that activity, known as an ‘emission factor’. For example to estimate emissions from the energy sector (typically contributing over 90% of CO2 emissions and 75% of all GHG emissions in developed countries) the quantity of fuels combusted is combined with an emission factor - the level of sophistication increasing with the accuracy and complexity of the emission factor. Table 2 outlines how the UK implements these guidelines to estimate some of its emissions-producing activities.|$|E
50|$|Ireland {{has set a}} {{national}} target to reduce energy demand by 20% of the historic average energy use during the period 2000-2005 through energy efficiency measures. The current suite of measures is described in detail in Ireland’s National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) and annual reports. A binding EU target for renewable energy use is also established. 16% of final energy use and 10% of energy use in the transport sector must be derived from renewable sources by 2020. In order to achieve Ireland’s overall renewable energy target, national sub-targets have also been set in the end-use sectors of heat (12%) and electricity (40%). Ireland, along with Denmark and Luxembourg, has the most challenging target for greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the EU; Ireland’s target is to achieve 20% lower than the 2005 greenhouse gas emissions levels by 2020. Achieving Ireland’s energy targets will help meet its binding EU greenhouse gas emissions target in heat and transport, but does not guarantee it. Emissions targets also include emissions from agriculture and waste disposal; such emissions currently account for 35% of Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions, with energy-related <b>emissions</b> <b>accounting</b> for the remainder.|$|E

Data availability {{has been the}} main issue faced by researchers when trying to establish robust consumption-based <b>emission</b> <b>accounts</b> (Wiedmann et al. 2007; Hoekstra 2010), conditioning the type of IO models that they have used. Early contributions to this literature were almost all restricted to national IO tables relying on a single country input–output (SRIO) model and the domestic technology assumption (DTA) for import flows (e.g. Kondo et al. 1998; Munksgaard and Pedersen 2001; Mäenpää and Siikavirta 2007). But this conveys an unrealistic picture of foreign emission intensities and production technology and excludes any trade links between other countries. A global multi-regional input–output (MRIO) model is to be preferred for calculating footprints (Turner et al. 2007) as emissions embodied in trade between other countries are adequately measured and feedback loops accounted for.
