40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{positive and}} negative money-supply shocks have symmetric <b>effects</b> on <b>output.</b> The {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that positive money-supply shocks do not have an <b>effect</b> on <b>output,</b> while negative money-supply shocks do have an <b>effect</b> on <b>output.</b> This finding is independent of whether or not expected money is assumed to affect output. The results reported in this paper imply that the Fed could increase the growth rate of real output by reducing the standard deviation of unexpected changes in the money supply.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the macroeconomic instability of the <b>output</b> <b>effects</b> of government spending financed by money seigniorage. The contribution of the paper is to show that these <b>output</b> <b>effects</b> are dependent on where the economy is in relation to certain inflation thresholds and that these thresholds are affected by the degree of ‘substitutability’ between government spending and private consumption. When government spending has no intertemporal effect on private consumption, there exists a single inflation threshold. When government spending has an intertemporal effect on private consumption, there exist two inflation thresholds. As the economy crosses each inflation threshold, it will suffer a reversal of <b>output</b> <b>effects.</b> reversal of <b>output</b> <b>effects,</b> inflation, money seigniorage, substitutability, complementarity...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} general {{framework}} for computing cartel damages claims. We decompose a direct purchaser plaintiff’s lost profits in three parts: the price overcharge, the pass-on <b>effect</b> and the <b>output</b> <b>effect.</b> The <b>output</b> <b>effect</b> is usually neglected: {{it is the}} lost business resulting from passing on the price overcharge. To evaluate {{the relative importance of}} the three effects, we introduce various models of imperfect competition for the plaintiff’s industry. We show that the passing-on defense generally remains justified after accounting for the <b>output</b> <b>effect,</b> provided that the cartel affects a sufficient number of firms. We derive exact discounts to the price overcharge, and illustrate how to compute these in the European vitamin cartel. We finally extend our framework to measure the cartel’s total harm, i. e. the total damages to direct purchasers and their consumers. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} cross-country {{evidence on}} a nonlinear Okun curve. The analysis {{is based on}} a simple error-correction model of unemployment. The model is estimated using a threshold model estimator. Evidence from 20 OECD countries for 1960 - 1997 gives support for the existence of nonlinearities in terms of the <b>output</b> growth <b>effects.</b> <b>Output</b> growth has a strong effect on unemployment when unemployment is low and output is high, and vice versa. Thus, in bad times, the <b>effect</b> of <b>output</b> growth on unemployment can be close to zero. In addition to this nonlinear <b>output</b> <b>effect,</b> also the population growth effect appears to be of similar type. The above mentioned basic results turn out to be robust in terms of estimation method (single equation vs pooled data estimation) and specification of the threshold variable.

In a distorted economy, price effects work to improve welfare, while <b>output</b> <b>effects</b> work to reduce it.

The introduction of sticky wages, besides being a realistic addition, solves these problems and preserves the expansionary <b>effects</b> on <b>output</b> and consumption. Moreover, once we introduce segmentation in the labor market, sticky wages are even essential to obtain expansionary effects.
