Both the relative risk and odds ratio are relevant in retrospective cohort studies, but only the odds ratio can be used in case-control studies.

In the case of lifetime average daily dose, variability pertains to the distribution and range of LADDs amongst individuals in the population.

40|$|Abstract: Epidemiologists {{have long}} {{regarded}} relative risk (RR) {{as a key}} measure of association between two binary variables. Yet even when the sample {{is representative of the}} population, associations having a RR> 9 may have a relatively small value for Phi (φ <. 3). This paper provide additional reasons for using RR instead of φ. (1) Formulas relating φ and RR are derived. A relative φ 2 is constructed and is shown to equal the attributable fraction in the population (AFP). RR is shown to increase monotonically with this relative φ 2 for a given <b>exposure</b> <b>factor</b> prevalence (H). (2) Constructs are created to measure degrees of necessity (N) and sufficiency (S). Related formulas are derived. RR is shown to increase monotonically with N for a given <b>exposure</b> <b>factor</b> prevalence (H). (3) Coordinates that will always generate admissible results are discussed. (4) RR is a good measure of association between two binary variables because it increases monotonically with AFP, with a relative φ 2 and with N for a given <b>exposure</b> <b>factor</b> prevalence (H). In Appendix B, auxiliary identities are presented including a Bayes’ rule comparison, the over-involvement rule and the non-response bias effect size...|$|R

50|$|Especially when {{determining}} {{the exposure of}} a population rather than individuals, indirect methods can often make use of relevant statistics about the activities {{that can lead to}} an exposure. These statistics are called <b>exposure</b> <b>factors.</b> They are generally drawn from the scientific literature or governmental statistics. For example, they may report informations such as amount of different food eaten by specific populations, divided by location or age, breathing rates, time spent for different modes of commuting, showering or vacuuming, as well as information on types of residences. Such information can be combined with contaminant concentrations from ad-hoc studies or monitoring network to produce estimates of the exposure in the population of interest. These are especially useful in establishing protective standards.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} base {{shows that}} prolonged exposure to respirable lunar dust could {{be detrimental to}} human health. Lunar dust {{is known to have}} a large surface area (i.e., it is porous), and a substantial portion is in the respirable range. The surface of the lunar dust particles is known to be chemically activated by processes ongoing at the surface of the moon. Predictions are that this reactivity will disappear on entry into the habitable volume; however, it is not known how quickly the passivation of chemical reactivity will occur, nor is it known how toxic the deactivated dust may prove to be. Although many Apollo astronauts seemed to tolerate lunar dust, their exposure times were brief and time (duration) <b>exposure</b> <b>factors</b> need to be determined. Other Apollo crew members and ground support personnel noted that the lunar dust was a sensory irritant. Finally, the size characteristics of the dust that actually was present in the atmosphere of the lunar lander have never been determined. Obtaining data will help NASA understand the size distribution of the particles that are expected to be found in future lunar habitats. It is important to design experiments that will close or, at a minimum, narrow knowledge gaps so that a scientifically defensible exposure standard can be set by NASA for protection of crew health.|$|E
