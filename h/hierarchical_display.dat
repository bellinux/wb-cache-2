In adults, research shows that the processes of integration and differentiation have the signature of self-organization. Does the same hold for children? The current study addresses this question with children between 6 and 9 years of age, using two tasks that require attention to <b>hierarchical</b> <b>displays.</b> A group of adults were tested as well, for control purposes. To get at the question of self-organization, reaction time data were submitted to a detrended fluctuation analysis and a recurrence quantification analysis. Hurst exponents shows a long-range correlations (1 /f noise), and recurrence measures (percent determinism, maximum line, entropy, and trend), show a deterministic structure of variability being characteristic of self-organizing systems. Findings are discussed in terms of organism-environment coupling that gives rise to fluid attention to <b>hierarchical</b> <b>displays...</b>|$|R
40|$|Numerous multivariate {{visualization}} {{techniques and}} {{systems have been}} developed {{in the past three}} decades to visually analyze and explore multivariate data being produced daily in application areas ranging from stock markets to the earth and space spaces. However, traditional multivariate visualization techniques typically do not scale well to large multivariate data sets, with the latter becoming more and more common nowadays. This paper proposes a general framework for interactive <b>hierarchical</b> <b>displays</b> (IHDs) to tackle the clutter problem faced by traditional mul-tivariate visualization techniques when analyzing large data sets. The underlying principle of this framework is to develop a multi-resolution view of the data via hierarchical clustering, and to use hierarchical variations of traditional multivariate visualization techniques to convey aggregation information about the resulting clus-ters. Users can then explore their desired focus region at dierent levels of detail, using our suite of navigation and ltering tools. We describe this IHD framework and its full implementation on four traditional multivariate visualization techniques, Preprint submitted to Elsevier Science 16 July 2001 namely, parallel coordinates [9, 19], star glyphs [16], scatterplot matrices [4], and di-mensional stacking [12], as implemented in the XmdvTool system [18, 13, 6, 7].

40|$|We {{explore the}} effects of {{selecting}} alternative layouts in <b>hierarchical</b> <b>displays</b> that show multiple aspects of large multivariate datasets, including spatial and temporal characteristics. <b>Hierarchical</b> <b>displays</b> of this type condition a dataset by multiple discrete variable values, creating nested graphical summaries of the resulting subsets in which size, shape and colour {{can be used to}} show subset properties. These 'small multiples' are ordered by the conditioning variable values and are laid out hierarchically using dimensional stacking. Crucially, we consider the use of different layouts at different hierarchical levels, so that the coordinates of the plane can be used more effectively to draw attention to trends and anomalies in the data. We argue that these layouts should be informed by the type of conditioning variable and by the research question being explored. We focus on space-filling rectangular layouts that provide data-dense and rich overviews of data to address research questions posed in our exploratory analysis of spatial and temporal aspects of property sales in London. We develop a notation ('HiVE') that describes visualisation and layout states and provides reconfiguration operators, demonstrate its use for reconfiguring layouts to pursue research questions and provide guidelines for this process. We demonstrate how layouts can be related through animated transitions to reduce the cognitive load associated with their reconfiguration whilst supporting the exploratory process...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the extent to which selective attention to spatial frequency (SF) mediates local versus global perception in general and in the context of face perception. Previous research has suggested a relationship between processing high versus low SFs and local versus global perception, respectively, but the nature of this relationship is debated. The experiments reported here demonstrate that attention to local and global aspects of a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>display</b> biases the flexible selection of relatively higher and relatively lower SFs during image processing. Moreover, the attentional selection of relative SF mediates the perceptual integration of the identity of elements in a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>display</b> with the level (local/global) at which they occur. Finally, the attentional selection of SF is shown to modulate early stages of face perception reflected in the N 170 -effect, a neurobiological index of face categorization that is particularly sensitive to face features. The N 170 -effect is found to be equally robust in response to the selection of both HSFs and LSFs in face-related stimuli, but the reliance on one SF scale or another is contingent upon the nature of the attended face-related stimulus, and whether its configuration is intact. Taken together, this investigation provides clear evidence that the flexible, top-down selection of low-level SF channels mediates the perception of local and global elements of visual displays, both for tightly controlled experimental stimuli as well as faces, a natural and frequently viewed hierarchical object category...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{prominent}} model {{suggests that}} individuals {{to the right}} of the political spectrum are more cognitively rigid and less tolerant of ambiguity than individuals to the left. On the basis of this model, we predicted that a psychological mechanism linked to the resolution of visual ambiguity – perceptual bias – would be linked to political attitude. Perceptual bias causes western individuals to favour a global interpretation when scrutinizing ambiguous <b>hierarchical</b> <b>displays</b> (e. g., alignment of trees) that can be perceived either in terms of their local elements (e. g., several trees) or in terms of their global structure (e. g., a forest). Using three tasks (based on Navon-like hierarchical figures or on the Ebbinghaus illusion), we demonstrate (1) that right-oriented Westerners present a stronger bias towards global perception than left-oriented Westerners and (2) that this stronger bias is linked to higher cognitive rigidity. This study establishes for the first time that political ideology, a high-level construct, is directly reflected in low-level perception.

40|$|Spatial {{frequency}} (SF) selection {{has long}} been recognized {{to play a role}} in global and local processing, though the nature of the relationship between SF processing and global/local perception is debated. Previous studies have shown that attention to relatively lower SFs facilitates global perception, and that attention to relatively higher SFs facilitates local perception. Here we recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to investigate whether processing of low versus high SFs is modulated automatically during global and local perception, and to examine the time course of any such effects. Participants compared bilaterally presented hierarchical letter stimuli and attended to either the global or local levels. Irrelevant SF grating probes flashed at the center of the display 200 ms after the onset of the hierarchical letter stimuli could either be low or high in SF. It was found that ERPs elicited by the SF grating probes differed as a function of attended level (global vs. local). ERPs elicited by low SF grating probes were more positive in the interval 196 - 236 ms during global than local attention, and this difference was greater over the right occipital scalp. In contrast, ERPs elicited by the high SF gratings were more positive in the interval 250 - 290 ms during local than global attention, and this difference was bilaterally distributed over the occipital scalp. These results indicate that directing attention to global versus local levels of a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>display</b> facilitates automatic perceptual processing of low versus high SFs, respectively, and this facilitation is not limited to the locations occupied by the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>display.</b> The relatively long latency of these attention-related ERP modulations suggests that initial (early) SF processing is not affected by attention to hierarchical level, lending support to theories positing a higher level mechanism to underlie the relationship between SF processing and global versus local perception...|$|E

Although state governments have instituted several mechanisms, salary and non-salary, to attract health workers to rural areas, individually these mechanisms typically focus on single issues (e. g. salary).

We propose a solution approach for interactive visual analysis of website usage, which integrates usage modeling and visual rendering. Our approach not only makes the approach scalable to large data by reducing the time for visual rendering, but also enables easier interaction for subsequent analysis by visually presenting responses to queries in the global context of historic usage behavior. As the first step, we apply a fuzzy clustering technique to web log data to obtain a usage model and image it through a two-view display showing a point cloud rendering of clustered sessions and the website page hierarchy. Since web usage data is high-dimensional and non-Euclidean, we combine two dimensionality reduction techniques, namely Multidimensional Scaling and Sammon mapping for transforming the usage session data into displayable primitives. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we have developed a prototype system and performed experiments using large datasets which supports (1) clickstream visualization to identify macro level trends in real time, (2) decision on when web site restructuring is needed based on a proposed cost model while interactively rearranging nodes in the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>display,</b> and (3) visual depiction of noise for intuitively deciding upon when {{to carry out the}} expensive process of reclustering data.
