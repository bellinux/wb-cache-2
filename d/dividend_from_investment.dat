[...] In 1931 Olivia doubled Dorothy's income, who by that time had additional income {{in the form of}} various family bequests and <b>dividends</b> <b>from</b> <b>investments.</b> With her husband earning as little as ₤50 annually, the Pounds lived on Dorothy's income. Olivia set up a stock account for her which was soon depleted because she followed Pound's advice to invest in Italian stock. She inherited ₤16,000 from her mother, but during the war the money was inaccessible with assets from England prohibited from being sent to an Axis country.

50|$|The Mishnah forbids {{the drawing}} of {{interest}} and <b>dividends</b> <b>from</b> <b>investments,</b> arguing that people should instead buy land and draw income from it. The Mishnah also counts gifts, which aim to encourage the offering of loans, to {{be a form of}} interest, paid in advance; similarly, gifts given in thanks for a loan, are another form of interest, according to the Mishnah, even if the loan is repaid when the gift is offered. It even {{goes so far as to}} forbid the loaning of things other than money since by the time the loan had to be repaid, the market value of the loaned thing could have risen, which effectively constituted interest; likewise, the exchange of labour between two individuals was forbidden by the Mishnah, if the work by one of the individuals would be more laborious than the other.|$|R

5000|$|The American Gas Association {{has faced}} {{financial}} issues regarding the taxation of dividends. In 2002, The American Gas Association's main priority was to eliminate double taxation on dividends. AGA analyst Charlie Fritts voiced his {{opinions about the}} opposition of double taxation due to the possible effects it can have on gas companies. The United States tax code has also been seen as problematic by the American Gas Association, mostly because it creates an uneven playing field for companies that pay dividends and gas companies that maintain most of their earnings. Fritts had also viewed double taxation as problematic because the gas utility industry is expected to raise approximately $100 billion in capital in the following 20 years after 2002, which can be hampered if profits (<b>dividends)</b> <b>from</b> <b>investments</b> are highly taxed. The main goal {{was to develop a}} natural gas infrastructure in the United States. Fritts also stated that [...] "natural gas demand is expected to grow 50 percent between 2003 until 2020; utilities must raise substantial capital to build 255,000 miles of natural gas distribution pipe to meet that demand." ...|$|R
50|$|Controversy {{followed}} {{in the wake of}} the release when some of the investors in the video reported they were promised <b>dividends</b> <b>from</b> their <b>investment,</b> but had received none. It was claimed that Kobayashi had got over 50 investors for the project, but that her husband had used the money to pay personal debt and for recreational activities unrelated to the film. Insufficient communication with the investors, the shutting down of the film's website, the company repeatedly changing its name, and changing reports on whether or not the film made a profit added to investor complaints. In 2004, Kobayashi was reported working as a hostess at her nightclub in Roppongi.|$|R

500|$|Historically the LNC had {{invested}} {{much of its}} income from burials and fares, and used the <b>dividends</b> <b>from</b> these <b>investments</b> to pay for cemetery upkeep. Although Alliance Property kept the name [...] "London Necropolis Company" [...] for its funeral business, it was a property developer with {{no interest in the}} funeral industry, and saw little reason to spend large amounts maintaining the cemetery, proceeding with the proposed crematorium, or promoting new burials of bodies or cremated remains. The rising popularity of cremation meant the rate of burials was at a historic low, while the Victorian character of the cemetery had fallen out of fashion. The income from burials was insufficient to maintain the cemetery grounds, and the cemetery began to revert to wilderness. Over the course of the 1960s most undertaking work at Brookwood came to an end.|$|R

50|$|The risk {{resulting}} {{from the fact that}} interest or <b>dividends</b> earned <b>from</b> an <b>investment</b> {{may not be able to}} be reinvested in such a way that they earn the same rate of return as the invested funds that generated them. For example, falling interest rates may prevent bond coupon payments from earning the same rate of return as the original bond. Pension funds are also subject to reinvestment risk especially with the short-term nature of cash investments there is always the risk that future proceeds will have to be reinvested at a lower interest rate.|$|R
40|$|The {{biomedical}} research complex {{has been estimated}} to consume {{almost a quarter of}} a trillion US dollars every year.

Some examples of individual initiatives show ways to reduce waste and increase value in {{biomedical research}}. This momentum will probably move strongly across stakeholder groups, if collaborative relationships evolve between key players; further important work is needed to increase research value.
