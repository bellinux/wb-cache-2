5|$|Call of Cthulhu: Destiny's End was a third-person {{perspective}} survival horror {{title for}} the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, which was originally announced in November 2002 as a PlayStation 2-exclusive Call of Cthulhu: Tainted Legacy for a planned release {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2004. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> direct sequel to Dark Corners of the Earth, set in the ruins of Innsmouth and in locations along the coast of New England in modern times, nearly 80 years after the events of the original game. It was to feature a cooperative multiplayer mode for two players, each controlling one of the two characters: the gun-wielding Jacob and the magic-using Emily (in its early version, Tainted Legacy, they were Joshua and Jack Walters' granddaughter Madeline). Its gameplay was publicly presented during the E3 2005.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Stackpole {{received}} {{a commission to}} sculpt his interpretation of Colorado River explorer John Wesley Powell, for display in the Main Interior Building of the U.S. Department of Interior. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> companion piece to Heinz Warneke's portrayal of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Warneke learned that Stackpole intended a water scene, so he changed his portrayal of Lewis and Clark {{to be one of}} them on land. Stackpole and Warneke delivered their stone reliefs in 1940, and the two panels were mounted on either side of the stage of the building's auditorium.|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, Walker joined League Two side Stevenage on loan until January 2011. He {{made his}} club debut {{just a day}} after signing for the club, {{starting}} in Stevenage's televised FA Cup tie away at AFC Wimbledon. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> scoring debut for Walker, scoring a free-kick that went in off the post to give Stevenage the lead in a 2–0 victory. He made his first league appearance for Stevenage in the club's 1–0 home loss to Northampton Town in December 2010, {{a game in which}} Walker hit the crossbar from a free-kick. Despite being due to stay at Stevenage until the beginning of January 2011, Walker was recalled by his parent club Watford on 23 December, in order to provide cover for the injured Stephen McGinn. Walker made two appearances for Stevenage, scoring one goal, as his loan spell at the club was disrupted by fixture postponements.|$|E
5|$|With no {{resources}} available from either Congress or the Continental Army, Irvine gave permission for volunteers to organize their own offensive. Detroit {{was too far}} and too strong for a small-scale operation, but militiamen such as David Williamson believed that an expedition against the American Indian towns on the Sandusky River was feasible. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> low-budget campaign. Each volunteer had to provide at his expense a horse, rifle, ammunition, rations, and other equipment. Their only payment would be an exemption from two months of militia duty, plus whatever plunder might be taken from the Indians. Because of ongoing Indian raids—the wife and children of a Baptist minister were killed and scalped in western Pennsylvania on May 12, 1782—there was no shortage of men willing to volunteer.|$|E

5|$|Howe and Murray {{returned}} to England in 1778. Howe was disaffected by his experiences of command in North America, and consequently did not bestow patronage on those junior officers under his command, {{as was the}} custom. Instead a friend of Murray's father, Captain George Montagu arranged for him {{to draw up a}} record of his service and good conduct in the North American campaign, which was then passed on to the First Lord of the Admiralty, John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. He passed his lieutenant's examination on 19 November 1778, and quickly received his commission on 31 December that year. He was to be second lieutenant aboard the 32-gun , under Captain Charles Holmes Everitt. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> short-lived appointment as on 19 March 1779 she ran aground and was wrecked on the Breton coast while chasing a French frigate. Murray was captured and became a prisoner of war, spending the next two years in captivity and occupying himself with the study of the French language and naval regulations. He was released and exchanged {{when he came to the}} attention of the French authorities after chastising an American privateersman for wearing a British uniform.|$|E

25|$|When California was {{admitted}} {{as a state}} under the Compromise of 1850, Californians had already decided <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> free state—the constitutional convention of 1849 unanimously abolished slavery. As a result, Southerners in Congress voted against admission in 1850 while Northerners pushed it through, pointing to its population of 93,000 and its vast wealth in gold. Northern California, which was dominated by mining, shipping, and commercial elites of San Francisco, favored becoming a state.|$|E

After reviewing the Three-age System from Lucretius to Thomsen, Lubbock improved it and took it to another level, that of cultural anthropology. Thomsen had been concerned with techniques of archaeological classification. Lubbock found correlations with the customs of savages and civilization.|$|E

The Lovériens told the English <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bell tower, which it later became and remains so today.
