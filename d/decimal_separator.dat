25|$|The integer part, or {{integral}} part of a decimal is the integer written {{to the left of}} the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> (see also truncation). For a nonnegative decimal, it is the largest integer that is not greater than the decimal. The part from the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> to the right is the fractional part, which equals the difference between the numeral and its integer part.|$|E
25|$|The {{notation}} {{to state}} a capacitor's {{value in a}} circuit diagram varies. The letter and digit code for capacitance values following IEC 60062 and BS 1852 avoids using a <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> and replaces the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> with the SI prefix symbol for the particular value (and the letter F for weight 1). Example: 4n7 for 4.7nF or 2F2 for 2.2F.|$|E
25|$|Numbers {{larger than}} 9 {{are written in}} Bengali using a {{positional}} base 10 numeral system (the decimal system). A period or dot is used to denote the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator,</b> which separates the integral and the fractional parts of a decimal number. When writing large numbers with many digits, commas are used as delimiters to group digits, indicating the thousand (হাজার hazar), the hundred thousand or lakh (লাখ lakh or লক্ষ lôkkhô), and the ten million or hundred lakh or crore (কোটি koti) units. In other words, leftwards from the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator,</b> the first grouping consists of three digits, and the subsequent groupings always consist of two digits.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{not only}} for brevity (for example when printed on the part or PCB), but also to {{circumvent}} the problem that <b>decimal</b> <b>separators</b> tend to [...] "disappear" [...] when photocopying printed circuit diagrams.|$|R
5000|$|The symbols [...] "٫", [...] "٬", [...] "٪", [...] "؉" [...] and [...] "؊" [...] {{may be used}} as the <b>decimal</b> mark, {{thousands}} <b>separator,</b> percent sign, {{per mille}} sign and per ten thousand sign respectively when writing with Eastern Arabic numerals, e.g. 3.14159265358 [...] "٣٫١٤١٥٩٢٦٥٣٥٨", 1,000,000,000 [...] "١٬٠٠٠٬٠٠٠٬٠٠٠", 100% [...] "٪١٠٠". See also: Modern Arabic mathematical notation.|$|R
25|$|Amounts in escudos {{were written}} as escudos $ centavos with the cifrão as the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> (e.g. 25$00 means $25.00, 100$50 means $100.50). Because of the {{conversion}} rate of 1000 réis = $1, three decimal places were initially used ($1 = 1$000).|$|E
25|$|The {{exact age}} of the Maya numerals is unclear, but it is {{possible}} that it is older than the Hindu–Arabic system. The system was vigesimal (base20), so it has twenty digits. The Mayas used a shell symbol to represent zero. Numerals were written vertically, with the ones place at the bottom. The Mayas had no equivalent of the modern <b>decimal</b> <b>separator,</b> so their system could not represent fractions.|$|E
25|$|Conversion between {{different}} scientific notation {{representations of the}} same number with different exponential values is achieved by performing opposite operations of multiplication or division by a power of ten on the significand and an subtraction or addition of one on the exponent part. The <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> in the significand is shifted x places to the left (or right) and x is added to (or subtracted from) the exponent, as shown below.|$|E
500|$|Since the {{question}} of 0.999... {{does not affect the}} formal development of mathematics, it can be postponed until one proves the standard theorems of real analysis. One requirement is to characterize real numbers that can be written in decimal notation, consisting of an optional sign, a finite sequence of one or more digits forming an integer part, a <b>decimal</b> <b>separator,</b> and a sequence of digits forming a fractional part. For the purpose of discussing 0.999..., the integer part can be summarized as b0 and one can neglect negatives, so a decimal expansion has the form ...|$|E
2500|$|Converting {{a number}} from {{scientific}} notation to decimal notation, first remove the ×10n on the end, then shift the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> n digits {{to the right}} (positive n) or left (negative n).

2500|$|First, {{move the}} <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> point {{sufficient}} places, n, {{to put the}} number's value within a desired range, between 1 and 10 for normalized notation. If the decimal {{was moved to the}} left, append [...] "×10n"; to the right, [...] "×10−n". To represent the number [...] in normalized scientific notation, the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> would be moved 6 digits to the left and [...] "×106" [...] appended, resulting in [...] The number [...] would have its <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> shifted 3 digits to the right instead of the left and yield [...] as a result.|$|E
2500|$|One common {{scheme is}} {{the letter and}} digit code for {{resistance}} values following IEC 60062. It avoids using a <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> and replaces the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> with a letter loosely associated with SI prefixes corresponding with the part's resistance. For example, 8K2 as part marking code, in a circuit diagram or in a bill of materials (BOM) indicates a resistor value of 8.2kΩ. Additional zeros imply a tighter tolerance, for example 15M0 for three significant digits. When the value can be expressed {{without the need for}} a prefix (that is, multiplicator 1), an [...] "R" [...] is used instead of the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator.</b> For example, 1R2 indicates 1.2Ω, and 18R indicates 18Ω.|$|E
2500|$|A decimal numeral, or just decimal, or, {{improperly}} decimal number, refers {{generally to}} the notation {{of a number}} in the decimal system, which contains a <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> (for example 10.00 or 3.14159). Sometimes these terms are used for the any numeral in the decimal system. A decimal may also refer to any digit after the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator,</b> such as in [...] "3.14 is the approximation of [...] to two decimals".|$|E
2500|$|In the French numeral notation, the comma ( [...] ,) is the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator,</b> {{whereas a}} space is used between {{each group of}} three digits (fifteen million five hundred {{thousand}} and thirty-two should be written as 15 500 032). In finance, the currency symbol {{is used as a}} <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> or put after the number. For example, €25,048.05 is written either 25 048€05 or 25 048,05 € (always with an extra space between the figure and the currency symbol).|$|E
2500|$|A decimal {{fraction}} is a fraction whose denominator is not given explicitly, but {{is understood to}} be an integer power of ten. Decimal fractions are commonly expressed using decimal notation in which the implied denominator {{is determined by the}} number of digits to the right of a <b>decimal</b> <b>separator,</b> the appearance of which (e.g., a period, a raised period (•), a comma) depends on the locale (for examples, see <b>decimal</b> <b>separator).</b> Thus for 0.75 the numerator is 75 and the implied denominator is 10 to the second power, viz. 100, because there are two digits {{to the right of the}} <b>decimal</b> <b>separator.</b> In decimal numbers greater than 1 (such as 3.75), the fractional part of the number is expressed by the digits to the right of the decimal (with a value of 0.75 in this case). 3.75 can be written either as an improper fraction, 375/100, or as a mixed number, [...]|$|E
2500|$|Decimal {{fractions}} with infinitely many digits to {{the right}} of the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> represent an infinite series. [...] For example, ⅓ = 0.333... represents the infinite series 3/10 + 3/100 + 3/1000 + ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> may be {{represented}} by either a dot or a comma depending on local usage - thus [...] "3.1m" [...] and [...] "3,1m" [...] are, {{as far as the}} standard is concerned, equally correct.|$|E
2500|$|For writing numbers, the decimal {{system uses}} ten decimal digits, a decimal mark, and, for {{negative}} numbers, a minus sign [...] "–". The decimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> is the dot [...] "" [...] {{in many countries}} (including English speaking ones), but may be a comma [...] "" [...] in other countries (mainly in Europe).|$|E
2500|$|Specifying [...] "display counts" [...] {{is another}} way to specify the resolution. Display counts give the largest number, or the largest number plus one (so the count number looks more impressive) the multimeter's display can show, {{ignoring}} the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator.</b> For example, a 5½ digit multimeter can also be specified as a 199999 display count or 200000 display count multimeter. Often the display count is just called the 'count' in multimeter specifications.|$|E
2500|$|The decimal {{system has}} been {{extended}} to infinite decimals, for representing any real number, by using an infinite sequence of digits after the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> (see Decimal representation). In this context, the usual decimals are sometimes called terminating decimals. A repeating decimal, is an infinite decimal, that, after some place repeats indefinitely the same sequence of digits (for example [...] ). indicates that the '144' sequence repeats itself indefinitely, i.e[...] An infinite decimal represents a rational number {{if and only if}} it is a repeating decimal or is a finite decimal.|$|E
2500|$|The Hindu–Arabic {{numeral system}} (or the Hindu numeral system) uses a <b>decimal</b> <b>separator,</b> {{commonly}} {{a period in}} English, or a comma in other European languages, to denote the [...] "ones place" [...] or [...] "units place", which has a place value one. Each successive place {{to the left of}} this has a place value equal to the place value of the previous digit times the base. Similarly, each successive place {{to the right of the}} separator has a place value equal to the place value of the previous digit divided by the base. For example, in the numeral 10.34 (written in base10), ...|$|E
50|$|Several {{characters}} in Unicode {{can serve as}} a <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> depending on the locale. Decimal fractions are represented in text as a sequence of decimal digit numerals with a <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> separating the whole-number portion from the fractional portion. For example, the decimal fraction for “¼” is expressed as zero-point-two-five (“0.25”). Unicode has no dedicated general <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> but unifies the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> function with other punctuation characters. So the “.” used in “0.25” is the same period character used to end the sentence. However, cultures vary in the glyph or grapheme used for a <b>decimal</b> <b>separator.</b> So in some locales, the comma may be used instead ”0,25”. Still other locales use a space for “0 25”. The Arabic writing system includes a dedicated character for a <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> that looks much like a comma ”٫” (U+066B) which when combined with the Arabic graphemes for the Arabic-Indic decimal digits to express one-quarter appears as: “٠٫٢٥”.|$|E
5000|$|Converting {{a number}} from {{scientific}} notation to decimal notation, first remove the × 10n on the end, then shift the <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> n digits {{to the right}} (positive n) or left (negative n).

5000|$|The Arabic-Indic numerals involve ten digits (for base ten; 0-9 [...] ) and a <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> {{that can}} be {{combined}} into composite numerals representing any rational number. Unicode includes these ten digits in the Basic Latin (or ASCII derived) block. Unicode has no <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> for common unified use. The Arabic script includes an Arabic specific <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> (U+066B). Other writing systems are to use whatever punctuation produces the appropriate glyph for the locale: for example ‘Full Stop’ (U+002E period) in United States usage and Comma (U+002C) in many other locales.|$|E

50|$|The <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> also follows local countries' standards. For instance, the United Kingdom often uses an interpunct as the {{decimal point}} on price {{stickers}} (e.g., £5·52), although not in print. Commas (e.g. €5,00) or decimal points (e.g. $50.00) are common separators {{used in other}} countries. See <b>decimal</b> <b>separator</b> for information on international standards.|$|E
