500|$|During a {{scene in}} the van, Tom Haverford tells Leslie he changed his name because his {{original}} name was too foreign sounding {{for a career in}} politics. When Leslie points about U.S. President Barack Obama has a foreign-sounding name, Tom gets upset. The reference to Obama's name was originally featured in a scene that was cut from Parks and Recreation pilot episode. Offerman, who barely moves and is often quiet throughout the episode, said he learned to use humor amid silence while serving as an altar boy and lector at his church. Offerman said, [...] "I had a cousin in the congregation, and I would speak with the utmost, august stoicism, and everyone would think I was a very effective speaker. But <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being facetious. He'd get in trouble for cracking up." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Audrey Pauley" [...] {{was written}} by Steven Maeda and {{directed}} by Kim Manners. The entry was Maeda's second ninth season entry after [...] "4-D". The episode features guest star Tracey Ellis as the titular Audrey Pauley. Ellis had previously appeared as a major character in the third season episode [...] "Oubliette". Annabeth Gish later noted that the episode, along with [...] "4-D", were her [...] "two favorite episodes" [...] because they [...] "are stand-alone episodes about Reyes and Doggett. Wonderful acting challenges, and the stories were fantastic." [...] Robert Patrick, whose friend Ted Demme had recently died, was worried about bringing too much emotion onto the set. He later noted, [...] "I was kind of raw. I remember being a little worried about bringing too much emotion to it. I felt safe with Kim; <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going through a tough time." ...|$|E
500|$|Ron Swanson {{was created}} by Parks and Recreation creators Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, {{although}} Nick Offerman himself had some input into the character's creation. Offerman said in July 2012 that [...] "NBC really resisted giving me this part. It took five months for me from the time Mike Schur and Greg Daniels said {{they wanted me to}} play this part. NBC insisted on auditioning every other guy in the country, and then they finally acquiesced." [...] The character's traits were partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official that Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur encountered in Burbank while researching for the show, who favored as little government interference as possible and admitted, [...] "I don't really believe in the mission of my job [...] [...] [...] I'm aware of the irony." [...] Ron is also partially inspired by political appointees of President George W. Bush who were perceived to be opposed to the branch of government they were overseeing. Ron's signature mustache {{was one of the first}} ideas conceived for the character. Offerman said the deadpan style of humor he uses for Ron Swanson was cultivated during his youth, when he was an altar boy: [...] "I would read things with the utmost sincerity, and my cousin would be cracking up because <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> full of shit." ...|$|E
6000|$|SIR PETER. Ah {{there needs}} no art to {{discover}} their merits--however he shall have his way--but pray does <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> married! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lucy, dearest," [...] she said, [...] "what {{has become}} of Rupert? Does <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dying? If so, {{why does he}} not come and see me, for the last time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|KING. [...] "'The Gout {{likes to}} take up his {{quarters}} with me; <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a Prince, and thinks I shall feed him well. But I feed him ill; I live very meagrely.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Balderstone later remembered, [...] "Ray Illingworth {{took me to}} Leicestershire. I {{might be}} a decent bloke on the outside but <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mentally hard through football. Cricketers might think they're pretty hard but they're not {{compared}} to footballers. It was a great move for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zhong Hui {{received}} a letter from Sima Zhao, which read: [...] "I fear Deng Ai might not submit. I have ordered Jia Chong to lead 10,000 infantry and cavalry into the Xie Valley and station at Yuecheng. I will lead 100,000 troops to garrison at Chang'an. We will be meeting each other soon." [...] After reading the letter, Zhong Hui was shocked and he told his close aides, [...] "When His Excellency ordered me to arrest Deng Ai, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> capable of accomplishing the task alone. However, now, since he has brought his troops here, he must be suspecting me. We should take action quickly. If we succeed, the Empire is ours. If we fail, we can retreat back to Shu Han and do as Liu Bei did before us. It is widely known that my plans have never failed once since the Shouchun rebellions. How can I be contented with such fame?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, the old feller; {{the one in}} {{the cart}} there. I think <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> runnin' away, though he didn't say {{anything}} about it; but he looked just as if he did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} young lady, forcing him down upon a stool, [...] "sit ye there and attend my {{sovereign}} good pleasure. I have {{life and death}} over you, and I will not scruple to abuse my power. Look to yourself; y' 'ave cruelly mauled my arm. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> not <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a maid, quoth <b>he!</b> Had <b>he</b> <b>known</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a maid, <b>he</b> had ta'en his belt to me, forsooth!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To what purpose? He cannot lend {{me such a}} sum, {{and would}} not if he could, for <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{otherwise}} drowned in debt; and he would only give me scraps of misanthropy and quaint ends of Latin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'One o' them damned gardeners o' th' Pickles,' said he, {{fingering}} the rent. 'Firin' to th' right flank, when <b>he</b> <b>knowed</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there. If <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> who <b>he</b> <b>was</b> I'd 'a' rippen the hide offan him. Look at ma tunic!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder whether}} <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a school teacher," [...] Agatha remarked. [...] "If he did know, it complicates the thing, because {{teachers}} are not often rich. Besides, how did he learn which was my room?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but not yet--not so soon. He {{must think}} I'm very gloomy, and I {{want to be}} always bright and cheerful with him. He knows why I wouldn't let him come in; <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going to have a}} cry." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{here the}} {{conversation}} ended, for Pie-Face Jones, waking crustily from stolen slumber, threatened Morrell and Oppenheimer {{with a report}} next morning that would mean the jacket for them. Me he did not threaten, for <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doomed for the jacket anyway.|$|E
6000|$|Then, laying {{his hand}} on my shoulder, and {{speaking}} with the sudden seriousness that comes so readily to shallow natures, he said, [...] "God has heard my prayer, old friend. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> weak. <b>He</b> has sent down an angel out of Heaven to help me." ...|$|R
60|$|MORELL. <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> {{afraid to}} let myself go before Eugene: he is so {{critical}} of sermons. (Looking at him.) <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid of him: he told me as much this morning. Well, I shall show him how much afraid <b>I</b> <b>am</b> by leaving him here in your custody, Candida.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Isaac, {{do you go}} on, and do your part. Tell them gently that Jonas has returned, that he {{has been}} a slave, and escaped from the Romans; and that, as far as <b>he</b> <b>knows,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> yet alive. Then, when they are prepared, bring him in, and let him answer their questions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know {{of nothing}} of the kind," [...] said Dick with great interest, [...] "but I admit I thought there might be {{something}} wrong somewhere. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> coming here to-day--in fact, he suggested it--but he sent Miss Asher no sort of message." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{were but}} lonesome then," [...] said Joe, [...] "living here alone, and I got acquainted with your sister. Now, Pip,"--Joe looked firmly {{at me as}} if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not going to agree with him;--"your sister is a fine figure of a woman." ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, he {{had always}} hated me; and now that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> Dora's {{discarded}} lover, he hated me worse than ever. He had got up and taken a bottle from the medicine-chest, I felt certain, and put something else instead of my quinine inside my paper.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How I have {{longed for}} this--for any {{one who could}} {{remember}} and tell me of her--of my mother--my poor, dear young mother! And her own brother! <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> thinking of it all night, and <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> here, and is as eager as myself. He is waiting for me,' ended Guy, hurrying off.|$|R
6000|$|But Tom he shinned up {{and went}} for the works and begun to slant her down, and back toward the lake, where the animals was {{gathering}} like a camp-meeting, and I judged he had lost HIS head, too; for <b>he</b> <b>knowed</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> too scared to climb, and {{did he want to}} dump me among the tigers and things? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} you need trouble yourself," [...] said he to his host, [...] "to help me to find my way home. I live with my tutor, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure that when <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> gone <b>he</b> will begin to search for me, and after awhile he will find me. Until then, <b>I</b> can <b>be</b> very {{comfortable}} here." ...|$|R
60|$|As I have said, I {{had it in}} my mind to cry {{out that}} he lied--that I was not Lesperon; that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> Bardelys. But the {{futility}} of such an outcry came to me simultaneously {{with the thought of}} it. And, I fear me, I stood before him and his satellites--the mocking Saint-Eustache amongst them--a very foolish figure.|$|E
60|$|I was desperate. Disaster stalked {{before me}} incarnate {{in the form}} of that gold-ear-ringed, weather-beaten son of the sea. Who was he? What was he? I must solve him ere he solved me. I must take a new orientation, or else those wicked policemen would orientate me to a cell, a police court, and more cells. If he {{questioned}} me first, before I knew how much <b>he</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> lost.|$|E
60|$|Set. Quite contrary; {{he told me}} I {{need not}} be so shy, to {{acknowledge}} myself to him; <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the devil; but he had learnt so much civility, as not to press his friend to a farther discovery than he was pleased. I should see I {{had to do with}} a gentleman; and any courtesy I should confer on him, he would not be unthankful; for he hated ingratitude of all things.|$|E
60|$|The manager {{turned to}} me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> an {{occasional}} customer, and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> who <b>I</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
60|$|Trice. But I {{wonder how}} the devil durst {{come into our}} ward, when <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> at the duties of--my family--this evening.|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolutely {{my first}} visit," [...] I answered. [...] "I met Louis by {{accident}} that night. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> bored, {{and he took}} me there." ...|$|R
60|$|He took {{no notice}} {{whatever}} of me, although I, {{on my way}} to the lee of the chart-house, stood at his shoulder a full minute, offering him a chance to speak. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there, for his big shoulder brushed my arm as he swayed and turned to warn the helmsmen in the one breath to hold her up to it but to keep her full. He had neither time nor courtesy for a passenger in such a moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "If this man's an impostor," [...] Charles went on--"and {{in spite}} of what he says about the National Gallery and so forth, we know nothing of him--the story he tells is just the sort of one such a fellow would trump up in a moment to deceive me. He could easily learn who I was--I'm a {{well-known}} figure; <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in Brighton, and he may have been sitting on that glass seat on Sunday on purpose to entrap me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Red Jacket grunted. [...] "Yes," [...] he says. [...] "He {{asked me}} that too. If {{he had been a}} small chief I should have lied. But he is a great chief. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a chief, so I told him the truth. I told him what Big Hand said to Cornplanter and me in the clearing--'There will be no war.' I could not see what he thought. I could not see behind his face. But he is a great chief. He will believe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, listen, and don't {{interrupt}} me. But {{first let}} me ask, does <b>he</b> <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{the owner of the}} brig that was lost?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, my dear!" [...] says my Lord Viscount. [...] "You {{are of the}} family--you are {{faithful}} to us, by George, and I tell you everything. Blandford will marry her--or"--and here he put his little hand on his sword--"you understand the rest. Blandford knows which of us two is the best weapon. At small-sword, or back-sword, or sword and dagger if he likes; I can beat him. I have tried him, Harry; and begad <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a man not to be trifled with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Hush, my dear!” says my lord viscount. “You {{are of the}} family—you are {{faithful}} to us, by George, and I tell you everything. Blandford will marry her—or ——” and here he put his little hand on his sword—“you understand the rest. Blandford knows which of us two is the best weapon. At small-sword, or back-sword, or sword and dagger, if he likes: I can beat him. I have tried him, Harry; and begad, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a man not to be trifled with.” ...|$|R
