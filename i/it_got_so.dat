When <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> close that it was moving the earth beneath her, she climbed onto the pile of rubble being pushed by the bulldozer.... Her head and upper torso were above the bulldozer's blade, and the bulldozer operator and co-operator could clearly see her. Despite this, the operator continued forward, which caused her to fall back, out of view of the driver. He continued forward, and she tried to scoot back, but was quickly pulled underneath the bulldozer. We ran towards him, and waved our arms and shouted; one activist with the megaphone. But the bulldozer operator continued forward, until Corrie was all the way underneath the central section of the bulldozer.|$|E
500|$|Cheryl is {{introduced}} as an emotionally fragile woman, who pines for the affection of Archer. As the series began to progress, the character abandons her depressive characteristics and adopts a more maniacal and unstable personality. [...] "It was really {{fun to see}} her evolve," [...] Greer asserted, [...] "and I think [...] and I always had fun recording together. I'm so thankful that <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> crazy and turned so upside down, and how nuts this character is. It's so fun." [...] Her instability has regularly resulted in Cheryl being sent into mental institutions. She is often sexually aroused from being choked. Commentators have described Cheryl as [...] "", [...] "insane", [...] "glue-chugging", and [...] "empty-headed". Throughout much of the first season, the character frequently developed aliases for herself to acquiesce to her coworkers; these aliases include Cristal, an homage to the alcoholic beverage of the same name, and Cariña, which she professed [...] "better captured [...] sensual womanhood".|$|E

500|$|McCreary {{introduced}} a new Hydra theme for the season, explaining that [...] "Last season got pretty musically complicated. I had a theme that associated itself with Centipede, The Clairvoyant, John Garrett and Raina. That theme ultimately functioned like a Hydra Theme. I had a theme for Victoria Hand that, while the audience briefly suspected her, also functioned as the Hydra Theme. I had a theme for Garrett that also acted like the theme for Hydra. <b>It</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> complicated ... The answer was obvious: I needed to write a new Hydra Theme, one that could be associated with Dr. Whitehall." [...] For Hayley Atwell's appearances as Peggy Carter, McCreary decided to quote the Agent Carter theme composed by Christopher Lennertz for the Agent Carter short film. On using Lennertz's theme, McCreary said, [...] "I was excited {{for the opportunity to}} incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [...] Universe together as a coherent whole ... Chris was thrilled and sent me his scores for reference." [...] A soundtrack featuring music from the first and second seasons was released by Marvel Music digitally on September 4, 2015, and on CD in October 2015.|$|E
500|$|Hendrix {{was not as}} {{confident}} {{a singer}} as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier {{between him and the}} control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix's penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: [...] "Sometimes, <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> loud we'd turn the [...] monitors off and there was really very little difference." [...] Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix's music were not always positive: [...] "I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot of people, saying, 'I can't see what all the fuss is about myself', or 'I don't know how you listen to all that noise; I'd be scared to work with him'... Chas was convinced that he was on to something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right." [...] Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who would show up at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: [...] "It was extraordinary. I worked with the Stones. I worked with the Beatles. I worked with Led Zeppelin. I was not as jumpy; it was not as difficult as with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork." ...|$|E

Checker's [...] "Twist", however, was a nationwide smash, aided by his many appearances on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, the Top 10 American Bandstand ranking of the song, and the teenagers on the show who enjoyed dancing the Twist. The song was so ubiquitous that Checker felt that his critics thought that he could only succeed with dance records typecasting him as a dance artist. Checker later lamented:"...in a way, [...] "The Twist" [...] really ruined my life. I {{was on my way}} to becoming a big nightclub performer, and [...] "The Twist" [...] just wiped it out... <b>It</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> out of proportion. No one ever believes I have talent."

2500|$|The BBC hired many out-of-work {{broadcasting}} {{staff who}} {{had come from the}} former offshore stations. Kenny Everett was asked for input in how to run the new Pop station due to his popularity with both listeners and fellow presenters.

He attempted to duplicate the same sound for BBC Radio One. Among the other DJs hired was the late John Peel who had presented the overnight show on [...] "Big L", called The Perfumed Garden. Though it only ran for a few months prior to Big L's closure, The Perfumed Garden got more fan mail {{than the rest of the}} pop DJ's on Radio London put together, so much that staff wondered what to do with it all. The reason <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> much mail was that it played different music, and was the beginning of the [...] "album rock" [...] genre.

2500|$|Kiedis has battled drug addiction, {{including}} {{heroin and}} cocaine, throughout his life. Since {{his father was}} an addict, Kiedis was constantly exposed to drug-using and drug-dealing behavior while growing up. [...] Some of Kiedis' early drug use came from substances he got from his father, including marijuana, which he first smoked when he was 12 years old. He used drugs for years, including during {{the formation of the}} band, where other members were also using. A few years into the band's career, he was briefly fired due to his heavy drug use, and at times <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> bad that he failed to show up to some of the band's performances. One night, Kiedis decided to go out and score drugs, which made him miss a performance so the band replaced him with singer Keith Morris. He tried to get clean after Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak died of a heroin overdose (specifically using the method of speedballing) on June 25, 1988, saying he would never shoot up again. He entered rehab and ended up staying clean for five years, but he relapsed in 1994, causing a major delay in the release of the band's 1995 album, One Hot Minute, and he kept using on and off over the next six years.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1988, police closed an {{investigation}} into alleged jamming of the Cox campaign's phone lines by supporters of Rosenberg. [...] "For several weeks, about every third call we got {{was one of these}} bogus calls. You would hear a kind of whirring noise like a machine of some kind. ... <b>It</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> bad just before the election that we had to move our get-out-the vote operation to another office and use cellular phones in the field," [...] said Cox's campaign manager Bob Schuman. A representative of the police said that charges were not made because though the location of the jamming was traced, it could not be determined specifically which individuals were responsible. [...] "It's incredible to me that someone can do what was done to us and we have an absolute identification" [...] of the location of the jamming, said Schuman. [...] "I can't speak for Chris, but I feel pretty strongly that we don't want to let them get away with it. We don't want to let it end here," [...] he said. Rosenberg denied knowledge about the phone jamming. [...] "I don't know anything about it. I don't want to speculate about who might have done this to Cox's phones, but I certainly don't condone it," [...] said Rosenberg. Rosenberg posited that the Cox campaign was requested police look into the matter as a tactic to discourage him from attempting a write-in-campaign against Cox in the November general election for Congress. According to the Orange County Deputy District Attorney, the phone calls were traced to a residence owned by Rosenberg supporters. The residence belonged to a developer and his wife who had each made donations of $1,000 to Rosenberg's campaign for Congress.|$|E

2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back. We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E
2500|$|The New Zealand advance {{began at}} 04:00, {{at the same}} time the 3rd Brigade made towards a redoubt over [...] to the south. It was not for another hour that the Composite Brigade set out, but they located a trench system from the well to Lake Bardawil. The ANZAC Division {{advanced}} through Turkish artillery and machine gun fire, until <b>it</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> heavy that it threatened the safety of their horses. Dismounting they continued on foot. However, they were not advancing in one continuous line. There was a gap around [...] between the New Zealanders and the depleted Composite Brigade and around [...] between the 3rd Brigade and the New Zealanders. By 05:00 that the New Zealand Brigade had reached a high point that overlooked the well and the Turkish position. An hour later the Turkish troops, left their trenches fixed bayonets and counter-attacked the New Zealand Brigade in two columns. This first assault faltered in the face of the New Zealanders machine-gun and supporting artillery fire from the Somerset Battery, Royal Horse Artillery. The respite lasted for thirty minutes when the Turkish troops attacked the New Zealanders again. Then the Composite Brigade, which was still advancing, came under fire from artillery, anti-aircraft and machine-guns, was halted around [...] from the Turkish lines. By 07:00 the Turkish had discovered the gap in the ANZAC Division line between the New Zealanders and the Composite Brigades and were trying to exploit it. An hour later on the southern flank the 3rd Brigade advance was halted and they were ordered to change their direction of advance towards Ard, instead of trying to circle it. At the same time closing the gap between them and the New Zealanders. The New Zealand Brigade advanced again, and at one stage it seemed like two of their regiments, may succeed in breaking into the Turkish position. But elsewhere in the north and south the brigades had been fought to a standstill. Turkish artillery fire intensified and at 10:30 Chavaul asked for air support to help locate their batteries. Part of the problem being they were a larger calibre than the British guns and were out-ranging them. At the same time he sent one of his reserve regiments the Warwickshire Yeomanry to support the Composite Brigade.|$|E
