40|$|The {{successful}} {{national liberation}} movements of southern Africa have become dominant-party regimes. However, many now face {{a series of}} political and economic crises that have the potential to put the region's stability at risk. Dominant-party regimes in southern Africa base their legitimacy on liberating the nation from colonialism and being an expression of the people's will. However, they preside over an exclusionary social order. The promotion of <b>formal</b> <b>measures</b> of democratisation which focus on periodic elections, formal constitutions, and the existence of opposition parties have had limited success in loosening the political stranglehold of dominant parties. In fact, the adoption of such <b>formal</b> <b>measures</b> has given dominant parties a measure of international legitimacy, to varying degrees, while many of these nominally democratic regimes are restricting the expression of dissent, closing spaces for opposition, and clinging to power by constitutional amendments or popular referenda of questionable democratic credentials. The promotion of economic liberalisation measures - such as creating a "business friendly" environment and courting foreign direct investment (FDI) - especially for the extractive sector and its associated infrastructure, has not provided growth in ways perceived by many to be socially just. Instead, it has tended to concentrate wealth in relatively narrow ruling circles, bolstering the power of ruling parties while contributing to growing social polarisation. Many of the social crises facing dominant-party regimes in southern Africa are based on complex issues of distributional justice and inclusion, which are rooted in their particular social contexts. Foreign partners and donors should focus less on promoting <b>formal</b> <b>measures</b> of democratisation and economic liberalisation, which can be counterproductive, and instead promote more inclusive social and economic programmes, such as universal basic income...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to show the need for the business ethics planning, to disclose the need for the requisitely holistic planning of enterprise ethics, and to offer the concept of the requisitely holistic planning of enterprise ethics. Design/methodology/approach - The research cognitions on the importance of ethical core values, enterprise culture, ethical climate and informal as well as <b>formal</b> <b>measures</b> of business ethics are discussed and argued in application of the dialectical systems theory. The various research insights are used and applied in concluding concept of requisitely holistic planning of enterprise ethics. Findings - For successful implementation of the ethics program or plan, it is important that the program is internalized by all enterprise 2 ̆ 7 s stakeholders. The paper shows that credibility and ethical behaviour of an enterprise can be achieved only through requisitely holistic planning of enterprise ethics.

40|$|Introduction: Radiation therapy {{may offer}} {{patients}} presenting with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) symptom palliation {{and improvements in}} quality of life. This systematic review will address the role of radiation therapy {{in the management of}} MPM. Methods: A thorough systematic search of the literature was conducted for published articles and conference proceedings for applicable abstracts. Relevant trials were selected and assessed. Results: Three small randomized controlled trials compared prophylactic external beam radiation therapy to no radiation therapy for patients with thoracic tracts caused by drainage tubes or diagnostic procedures. None of those trials reported any serious adverse effects. A pooled analysis found no significant reduction in the frequency of procedure tract metastases. Four non-comparative studies have shown that hemithoracic irradiation alone resulted in significant toxicity, including radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis, radiation pneumonitis, and bronchopleural fistula, without any survival benefit. Few of the identified studies reported on symptom control, and no studies included <b>formal</b> <b>measures</b> of quality of life. Conclusion: There is limited evidence for the role of radiotherapy in the management of patients with MPM. Future studies including radiotherapy for the treatment of such patients should include <b>formal</b> <b>measures</b> of quality of life and symptom control...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{attempt is}} made to define the use of both topological and <b>formal</b> <b>measures</b> within the {{organisation}} of the built environment and to demonstrate the necessary integration of the two measures for understanding the social use of the built environment. Topological measures are here defined as all relational representations of built space such as relational maps, whereas <b>formal</b> <b>measures</b> are defined as transformational attribute-based representations such as shape grammars. Although these two aspects of the built environment are seen as separate in analysis, it is argued here that each aspect cannot be defined {{without reference to the}} other and they are, therefore, separable only in analysis and not in practice. In practice, social interaction takes place not just in space (relational structure) nor just in formal environments (formal structure), but within built structure as a whole. Therefore, through the integration of the two aspects, a deeper insight into the significance of built organisation may be gained. A compromise is offered to bring congruency between these two measures into the analysis of several megalithic tombs from Scotland. Though no complete integration of the relational and the formal is achieved, it is hoped that this paper will act as a catalyst and a challenge for work towards such an integration...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: This study {{aimed to}} {{validate}} a new observational measure of socially disinhibited behavior {{for use in}} a population of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method: Participants were twenty-two adults with severe TBI (mean age = 50. 45 years) and 21 healthy comparison participants (mean age = 45. 29 years). Ratings of observed social disinhibition were correlated with the disinhibition domain scores of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory–Disinhibition (NPI–D) and with Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale (SPRS) scores. A regression analysis was undertaken to determine whether <b>formal</b> <b>measures</b> of disinhibition could predict observed disinhibition. Results: The interrater absolute agreement for the social disinhibition ratings was good, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) =. 69. Participants with TBI were rated as significantly more disinhibited than comparison participants, t(25. 05) = – 2. 07, p =. 049. The ratings were positively correlated with the NPI frequency score (r =. 45, p =. 038) and distress score (r =. 45, p =. 035). The ratings were not related to change in employment or in interpersonal relationships on the SPRS, and <b>formal</b> <b>measures</b> of disinhibition were unable to predict observed social disinhibition. Conclusions: This study demonstrates good interrater reliability and construct validity of the observational measure. The results evidence the usefulness of this measure and the NPI–D for detecting social disinhibition after TBI. 13 page(s...|$|R
