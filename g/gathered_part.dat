40|$|These {{graduation}} theses dissert on {{possibilities of}} development of graphomotorical skills and beginning writing on integrated children with cerebral palsy. Theoretical {{part of the}} graduation theses are focused in questions about cerebral palsy in connection with process o f education. The main attention is given over to area of graphomotoric. The references to specific difficulties of these children in process of education are made and supportive actions with cancelling effect for the problems are proposed. Also the information about theme of specially-education diagnostics and about possibilities for support of graphomotorical ability by using method of stimulation and facility assistance is <b>gathered.</b> <b>Part</b> of graduation theses is comprehensive and systematic procedure o f beginning writing. The case studies present practical demonstration o f progress in graphomotorical skills of children with cerebral palsy at environment o f com m on school. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
40|$|Jupiter System Partner is {{currently}} working on a product idea called Information Logistics. The product focuses on collecting information via modules from several services in an enterprise system. The product will be based upon financial systems which can be customized via modules. Specifically, the product will be based upon their existing system called eSecretary which extends the economy system with a document storage where invoices, packaging documents and signatures can be stored. One of the limitations addressed by the managers at Jupiter is the lack of an integration platform where the modules and implementation can be <b>gathered.</b> <b>Part</b> of the Information Logistics product idea is a web interface where customers which have issued invoices can check the progress of their orders. This {{is currently}} not possible as the eSecretary system is deployed in company domains. The managers have therefore posted a request for a platform which will publish functionality for checking order progress and other modules. This thesis addresses the request and presents Information Logistics Service Router, an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) which integrates the eSecretary web service and other services and applications into a common access point. Information Logistics Service Router is a BizTalk application which serves as a basis for the Information Logistics product idea. The system integrates applications and services into a common access point using the BizTalk platform. The evaluation of Information Logistics Service Router shows that the system implements a simple, but useful integration basis for Information Logistics compared to other integration platforms such as Mule ESB and IBM WebSphere MQ...|$|E

40|$|Object-oriented {{techniques}} and concepts {{have been successfully}} used in language specification and formalization. They greatly improve modularity, reusability and extensibility. In spite of using OO paradigms in language specification, some semantic aspects still crosscut many language constructs. Improvements can be achieved with aspect-oriented techniques. The paper describes AspectLISA tool wich uses aspect-oriented approach for language specification (aspect-oriented attribute grammars). An example will be worked out in order to illustrate the approach. We will show how to identify an aspect, specify it in the concrete AspectLisa syntax, and how to <b>gather</b> <b>parts</b> {{in order to develop}} a complete language processor...|$|R

He used {{as many as eight}} to ten vehicles to create his large dinosaur sculptures [...] and the unaltered parts are identifiable. Common tools became pivotal structures in some of his sculptures. Volkswagens metamorphosed into turtles and prehistoric dinosaurs.|$|R

50|$|The player {{controls}} Harley, {{a man in}} a green suit who {{has shrunk}} himself to size of a bar of soap. The player's mission is to <b>gather</b> <b>parts</b> of Harley's (presumably) now-destroyed shrinking machine to return him to normal size. As the player advances through levels, they pick items such as tacks, rubberbands and marbles. The many locations the player adventures through is Harley's lab where the initial incident occurs, Harley's Kitchen, Harley's toy room, where the player pilots a toy tank by himself, Harley's Bathroom, and other stages. The Box Art (at right) was created for EA by veteran gaming illustrator Marc Ericksen and features Harley blasting out of the kitchen sink, holding a red plastic push pin for scale reference.|$|R
50|$|While {{originally}} {{limited to}} mainframe computers, liquid cooling {{has become a}} practice largely associated with overclocking {{in the form of}} either manufactured kits, or in the form of do-it-yourself setups assembled from individually <b>gathered</b> <b>parts.</b> The past few years have seen an increase in the popularity of liquid cooling in pre-assembled, moderate to high performance, desktop computers. Sealed ("closed-loop") systems incorporating a small pre-filled radiator, fan, and waterblock simplify the installation and maintenance of water cooling at a slight cost in cooling effectiveness relative to larger and more complex setups.Liquid cooling is typically combined with air cooling, using liquid cooling for the hottest components, such as CPUs or GPUs, while retaining the simpler and cheaper air cooling for less demanding components.|$|R

In this work we have <b>gathered</b> <b>parts</b> of the original contributions "Über die Form des Elastizitätsgesetzes bei ideal elastischen Stoffen", "Welche Umstände bedingen die Verfestigung bei der bildsamen Verformung von festen isotropen Körpern?" and "Das Superpositionsgesetz eines endlich deformierten relaxationsfähigen elastischen Kontinuums und seine Bedeutung für eine exakte Ableitung der Gleichungen für die zähe Flüssigkeit in der Eulerschen Form" which center around this deductive approach.

50|$|When Demona finally betrayed Xanatos {{to advance}} her own goals of {{destroying}} the human race, {{he was forced}} to call a truce with Goliath to stop her. Goliath was later instrumental in saving Xanatos's newborn son Alexander, something which Xanatos owed him a great debt, and pledged to pay back to him ("The <b>Gathering,</b> <b>Part</b> II"). He soon created new robotic bodies for Coldstone's other personalities to inhabit, which he named Coldfire and Coldsteel. Since these gargoyles were also created by magic, though, it was impossible for mind transfer to occur. While he and Fox were out to dinner, Puck and Alexander performed the transfer for him. When the existence of the gargoyles was revealed to the public, Xanatos puts an end to the feud between them and voluntarily allows the gargoyles to come back to live in their ancestral castle ("Hunter's Moon, Part III").|$|R
5000|$|The game {{focuses around}} vehicle combat. Players gain {{reputation}} with different factions, {{gaining access to}} new blueprints, parts, cars, and crafting. Players <b>gather</b> <b>parts</b> and materials via battle rewards, completing missions, breaking down unneeded equipment, or by purchasing items from other players via an in-game market. Each player's combat vehicle is only limited by the player's imagination and 2 mandatory parts {{that need to be}} integrated into each player's design: cabin and undercarriage (frame). Parts such as armor, weaponry, generators, and auxiliary devices are not required. Different combinations of these items let players custom tune vehicles to their own liking and playstyle. As there are no fixed traditional vehicle [...] "classes" [...] or vehicle roles, players are free to edit and modify their vehicle as they feel, allowing players to customize both the look and the technical aspects of their vehicle, honing their machine’s performance and looks to their liking.|$|R
