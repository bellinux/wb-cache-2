40|$|Lipophilic {{persistent}} {{organic pollutants}} (POPs) are ubiquitous in the environment and suspected to interfere with hormone activities and reproduction. In previous studies we demonstrated that POP exposure can affect sperm DNA integrity and differences between <b>Inuits</b> and Europeans in sperm DNA integrity and xenobiotic activity were observed. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate possible relations between human sperm chromatin integrity and the xenobiotic serum activity of lipophilic POPs assessed as effects on the estrogen (ER), androgen (AR), and/or aryl hydrocarbon (AhR) receptors. Human sperm chromatin integrity was assessed as DNA fragmentation index (%DFI) and high DNA stainability (%HDS) using the flow cytometric sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA). Xenobiotic receptor activities were determined using chemically activated luciferase gene expression (CALUX) assay. The study included 53 Greenlandic <b>Inuits</b> and 247 Europeans (Sweden, Warsaw (Poland) and Kharkiv (Ukraine)). A heterogeneous pattern of correlations was found. For <b>Inuits,</b> ER and AhR activities and %DFI were inversely correlated, whereas a positive correlation between AR activity and %DFI was found for Europeans. In contrast, no correlation between receptor activities and %HDS was observed for <b>Inuits</b> but for Europeans positive and negative correlations were observed between ER and AIR activities and %HDS, respectively. We suggest that the different patterns of xenobiotic serum activities, in combination with diet associated factors and/or genetics, might be connected to the observed differences in sperm chromatin integrity between the <b>Inuits</b> and Europeans...|$|R

5|$|In 1854, John Rae, while {{surveying}} the Boothia Peninsula for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), discovered {{further evidence of}} the expedition's fate. Rae met an Inuk near Pelly Bay (now Kugaaruk, Nunavut) on 21 April 1854, who told him of a party of 35 to 40white men who had died of starvation near the mouth of the Back River. Other <b>Inuit</b> confirmed this story, which included reports of cannibalism among the dying sailors. The <b>Inuit</b> showed Rae many objects that were identified as having belonged to Franklin and his men. In particular, Rae brought from the <b>Inuit</b> several silver forks and spoons later identified as belonging to Franklin, Fitzjames, Crozier, and Robert Osmer Sargent, a shipmate aboard Erebus. Rae's report was sent to the Admiralty, which in October 1854 urged the HBC to send an expedition down the Back River to search for other signs of Franklin and his men.|$|E

5|$|The First Nations in {{the north}} {{typically}} had some prior experience of Europeans, for example through contact with the Hudson's Bay Company, and there was little conflict between the police and these native communities, and few crimes committed.

By comparison, the mounted police got on much better with the <b>Inuit,</b> who had seen far less contact with Europeans. The force generally took a more liberal, paternalistic attitude towards them, often applying informal justice rather than official laws when the occasional <b>Inuit</b> crime was committed. Members of the First Nations and <b>Inuit</b> were employed to drive police dog sleds and cook for their patrols.|$|E

40|$|Human {{exposure}} to environmental contaminants is ubiquitous and can affect individuals living close to {{as well as}} remote from the sources of contaminants. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) include polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDDs/PCDFs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and certain pesticide residues. Exposure to POPs elicits a number of species- and tissue-specific toxic responses including effects on the reproductive-, immune- and thyroid system. Adverse effects have been documented in wildlife populations, whereas no clear cut evidence for adverse endocrine-related human health effects has been obtained. The toxicological assessment of individuals {{is complicated by the}} life long {{exposure to}} a complex mixture of contaminants. The present study compare the actual serum level of xeno-hormone (estrogenic and androgenic) and dioxin-like activity between populations from Greenland (<b>Inuit's)</b> and Europe (Sweden, Poland, Ukraine) for finally to evaluate possible associations to the POP markers PCB 153 and p,p'-DDE, semen DNA quality markers and lifestyle parameters. The SPE-HPLC serum fraction containing the actual mixture of bio-accumulated POPs, free of endogenous hormones, was used to determine the effect on the estrogen- (ER) and androgen-receptor (AR) trans-activity in stable transfected ER-luc MVLN and transient transfected ARE-luc CHO-K 1 cells, respectively. Serum dioxin-like activity was determined in serum fat extracts using the stable AhR-luc transfected Hepa 1. 12 cR cells. Sperm DNA damage was measured using Terminal Deoxynucleotydil Transferase assay and apoptotic markers Fas and Bcl-xL were determined by immune methods. Fluoremetric sperm chromatin structure assay was used to assess sperm DNA/chromatin integrity (DFI). The integrated net xenobiotic activities determined in serum elicited a district dependent pattern. Compared to controls significantly effects of the actual serum POP fraction on the activity of each of the receptors (ER, AR and AhR) was observed. <b>Inuit's</b> differed from the European groups by a higher frequency of samples with antagonized ER, higher AR potency and lower dioxin-like activity. Multiple regressions showed an interaction between semen DNA quality markers (DFI, DNA damage) and xenoestrogenic and dioxin-like activity across the groups. In the separate study groups <b>Inuit's</b> showed a negative correlation between the DNA quality markers and ER and AhR activities and no or few positive correlations for the European samples. No consistent association to the two POP markers was found. The data suggested that different POP burden profiles elicit differences in net xenobiotic receptor activities and effects on semen DNA quality markers. The <b>Inuit's</b> in general differed from the European groups. Future studies might elucidate whether genetic and/or life style factors {{play a role in the}} observed differences...|$|R

5|$|Two expeditions between 1860 and 1869 by Charles Francis Hall, {{who lived}} among the <b>Inuit</b> near Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island and later at Repulse Bay on the Canadian mainland, found camps, graves, and relics on the {{southern}} coast of King William Island, {{but none of the}} Franklin expedition survivors he believed would be found among the <b>Inuit.</b> Though he concluded that all of the Franklin crew were dead, he believed that the official expedition records would yet be found under a stone cairn. With the assistance of his guides Ebierbing and Tookoolito, Hall gathered hundreds of pages of <b>Inuit</b> testimony. Among these materials are accounts of visits to Franklin's ships, and an encounter with a party of white men {{on the southern}} coast of King William Island near Washington Bay. In the 1990s, this testimony was extensively researched by David C.

5|$|Aboriginal {{cultural}} areas {{depend upon}} their ancestors' primary lifeway, or occupation, {{at the time}} of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada. The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer and river fishing. In both of these areas the salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, shifting agriculture was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash. While for the <b>Inuit,</b> hunting was the primary source of food with seals the primary component of their diet. The caribou, fish, other marine mammals {{and to a lesser extent}} plants, berries and seaweed are part of the <b>Inuit</b> diet.

40|$|ABuryat {{population}} {{consisting of}} seven tribal groups in eastern Mongolia has been screened {{to determine the}} frequency distribution of different apolipoprotein E and H alleles (APOE and APOH, genes) coding for common isoforms and their association with quantitative plasma lipid levels. Allele frequencies at the APOE locus in 125 healthy Buryat aged 17 to 73 years were highest for APOE* 3 (0. 804), followed by APOE* 4 (0. 164) and APOE* 2 (0. 032). The APOH locus had high frequencies of APOH* 2 (0. 912) and APOH* 3 (0. 088). APOH* 1 was not detected. No significant differences were observed in the overall APOE allele frequencies between the Buryat and the Siberian Evenki, <b>Inuits,</b> and Indians in Asia, or with some European whites. The frequency distribution of the overall APOH alleles of the Buryat {{was similar to that}} of the Japanese in Asia. Overall plasma lipid levels of the Buryat (males aged 20 to 73 years, females aged 21 to 64 years) were considerably lower, comparable to those of the Evenki.

No significant effects of the APOH genotypes on any of the plasma lipid levels were observed.
