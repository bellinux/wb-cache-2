25|$|Docetaxel is a {{white powder}} and is the active {{ingredient}} available in 20mg and 80mg Taxotere single-dose vials of concentrated anhydrous docetaxel in polysorbate 80. The solution is a clear brown-yellow containing 40mg docetaxel and 1040mg polysorbate 80 per mL. 20mg Taxotere is distributed in a blister carton containing one single-dose vial of Taxotere (docetaxel) preparation in 0.5 mL sterile pyrogen-free anhydrous polysorbate 80, and a single dose Taxotere solvent vial containing 1.5 mL 13% ethanol in saline to be combined and diluted in a 250 mL infusion bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose for administration. 80mg Taxotere is supplied identically but with 2.0 mL polysorbate 80 and 6.0 mL 13% ethanol in saline. The docetaxel and solvent vials are combined to give a solution of 10mg/mL and the required dose is drawn from this solution. Vials have an overfill to compensate for liquid loss during preparation, foaming, adhesion to vial walls and the <b>dead</b> <b>volume.</b> 20mg vials may be stored for 24 months below 25°C away from light and 80mg vials for 26 months in the same conditions.|$|E

40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. P-V and T-S {{diagrams}} {{are commonly}} used tools to illustrate thermodynamic cycles. For recuperative cycles, {{it is easy to}} idealize a cycle so that the history of a gas element can be traced on P-V and T-S diagrams as it flows around the machine. In such cycles, <b>dead</b> <b>volumes</b> such as accumulators, reservoirs, and clearance space in piston compressors and expanders are not fundamental to the operation. However, such <b>dead</b> <b>volumes</b> do have practical purposes in controlling pressure variations in recuperative coolers. Regenerative cryocoolers also have <b>dead</b> <b>volumes,</b> which include the void volumes in heat exchangers, regenerators, and pulse tubes. Because of these volumes, gas elements do not traverse all components of the cooler. Rather, an element can remain in a single component. For the Stirling cycle, P-V and T-S diagrams can be constructed if the void volumes are ignored. However, what happens in a pulse tube cooler where the volumes of the pulse tube, inertance tube, and reservoir are fundamental to the coolers operation? P-V and T-S diagrams can still be constructed if they are reinterpreted to represent the envelope of the motion of all possible gas elements. This approach will be explored here...|$|R

2500|$|DESI can be {{coupled to}} {{ultra-fast}} liquid chromatography using an LC eluent splitting strategy. It {{is a strategy}} through a tiny orifice on an LC capillary tube. There is negligible <b>dead</b> <b>volume</b> and back pressure that allows for almost real time mass spectrometry detection with a fast elution and purification. This coupling {{can be used to}} ionize a wide range of molecules, from small organics to high mass proteins. This is different from ESI (electrospray ionization) in that {{it can be used to}} directly analyze salt-containing sample solutions without requiring [...] “make-up” solvents/ acids to be doped into the sample. This set up allows for a high flow rate without splitting. The high resolution that is accomplished by reverse-phase HPLC can be combined with this procedure to produce high throughput screening of natural products as well. The incorporation of the electrochemistry component helps with ionization efficiency via the electrochemical conversion. This method is proved better than ESI in the fact that you don't have to separate the small potential that is applied to the cell from the potential on the spray in DESI. DESI also shows a better tolerance to inorganic salt electrolytes and you can use traditional solvents used in electrolysis.|$|E

This technology allows manufacturers more flexibility in manufacturing. In turn this allows a larger design envelope in which to optimize their designs for a given application.

50|$|Typically, {{conventional}} air bearings {{are implemented}} with chambers and canals. This design assumes {{that with a}} limited amount of nozzles, the <b>dead</b> <b>volume</b> should decrease while distributing the air within the gap uniformly. Most constructive ideas refer to special canal structures. Since the late 1980s, air bearings with micro canal structures without chambers are manufactured. However, this technique also has to manage problems with <b>dead</b> <b>volume.</b> With an increasing gap height, the micro canal’s load and stiffness decreases. As in the case of high-speed linear drives or high-frequency spindles, this may cause serious disadvantages.|$|E

40|$|To {{increase}} disinfection {{potential in}} a chlorine contactor, {{it is often}} recommended to increase the detention time in the contactor, that is, its hydraulic efficiency. This {{can be accomplished by}} installing inner devices such as baffle walls, diffuser walls, and intrabasins. To more accurately analyze the effect of such inner devices, it is necessary to conduct transient hydrodynamic analysis, which is computationally intensive. To reduce this computational burden, this study develops a simplified approach using steady-state dead zone analysis. In addition, this study uses the simplified approach to explain, with an indicator of <b>dead</b> zone <b>volume</b> percentage, why hydraulic efficiency changes with using different designs of length/width ratio, shape factor, diffuser walls, and intrabasins. This study suggests a relationship between <b>dead</b> zone <b>volume</b> percentage and hydraulic effi-ciency to replace length/width ratio. This will increase the estimation accuracy of hydraulic efficiency with various designs of chlorine contactors while avoiding use of computationally intensive transient hydrodynamic analysis.
