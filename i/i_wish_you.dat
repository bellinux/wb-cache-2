25|$|I {{have removed}} Aspar and Ardaburius from this world, {{so that no}} one who might oppose me would survive. But you also must kill your {{son-in-law}} Ricimer, lest there be anyone who might betray you. Moreover, I also have sent the patrician Olybrius to you; <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> to kill him, so that you might reign, ruling rather than serving others.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. <b>I</b> almost <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> had, as <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> {{had looked}} unpolished. Your father, Caroline, {{naturally}} spoke well, quite otherwise than your worthy uncle--correctly, gently, smoothly. You inherit the gift." ...|$|R

500|$|Koubek did {{not like}} mixing older, smaller {{buildings}} with his designs. [...] "There {{is no place for}} big buildings next to little buildings," [...] he told The Washington Post in 1979. He was also critical of Federalist architecture. He once scathingly noted, [...] "I think that on Georgetown architecture I'd rather not comment at all. You may quote me on that. [...] <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> would." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{became the}} first United States {{president}} to die in office. His last words were to his doctor, but they were assumed to be directed at Vice President Tyler: [...] "Sir, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more." [...] Harrison served the shortest term of any American president: March 4– April 4, 1841, 30 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes.|$|E
500|$|He went on {{to exhibit}} {{considerable}} pride in the Haitian plantation built {{with the help of}} his sons: <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> would go there. [...] would give you the best in the house. You ought to go, to see how happy the human race can be. It is a fine, rich valley, about thirty miles from Port Platte; heavily timbered with mahogany all round; well watered; flowers so beautiful; fruits in abundance, so delicious that you could not refrain from stopping to eat, till you could eat no more. My sons have laid out good roads, and built bridges and mills; the people are improving, and everything is prosperous.|$|E

500|$|Harrison's doctors tried cures, {{applying}} opium, castor oil, leeches, and Virginia snakeroot. But {{the treatments}} only made Harrison worse, {{and he became}} delirious. He died nine days after becoming ill, at 12:30am on April 4, 1841, of right lower lobe pneumonia, jaundice, and overwhelming septicemia. He was the first United States president to die in office. His last words were to his doctor, but assumed to be directed at Vice President John Tyler, [...] "Sir, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more." [...] Harrison served the shortest term of any American president: March 4– April 4, 1841, 30 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes.|$|E
500|$|The {{co-operation}} between monarch and Parliament {{following the}} Gunpowder Plot was atypical. Instead, {{it was the}} previous session of 1604 that shaped the attitudes of both sides {{for the rest of}} the reign, though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity. On 7 July 1604, James had angrily prorogued Parliament after failing to win its support either for full union or financial subsidies. [...] "I will not thank where I feel no thanks due", he had remarked in his closing speech. [...] "...I am not of such a stock as to praise fools... You see how many things you did not well... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> would make use of your liberty with more modesty in time to come".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{addresses}} {{the end of}} a marriage between Beyoncé's parents Tina Knowles and Mathew Knowles. The lyrics are written in a form of an [...] "open letter" [...] in which the singer praises her mother's courage for ending a dysfunctional marriage. At the beginning of the song, Beyoncé sings, [...] "Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights / When you think about father / and how you tried to be the perfect wife... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> didn’t hurt at all." [...] Alex Frank of Vogue noted how the song was thematically [...] "an enlightened follow-up" [...] to [...] "Single Ladies", discussing a similar private subject matter for the singer. He further opined that the lyrics apply to other women who are part of toxic relationships.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's true, Dora. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> {{were there}} more than once. I would have written more, only {{we had a}} whole lot of trouble with our enemies." ...|$|R

500|$|Around midday, Rupert {{was joined}} on Marston Moor by Newcastle, {{accompanied}} by a mounted troop of [...] "gentleman volunteers" [...] only. Rupert greeted him by saying, [...] "My Lord, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> had come sooner with your forces, but I hope we shall yet have a glorious day." [...] Newcastle counselled that the three allied armies, with separate garrisons, recruiting areas and lines of communication to protect, would eventually separate. He also suggested waiting for a force of 3,000 under Colonel Clavering and collected garrisons amounting to another 2,000 to join the Royalist army. Rupert was adamant that the King's letter (which he never showed to Newcastle) was a command to engage and defeat the enemy immediately. Furthermore, Rupert wished {{to compensate for the}} Royalists' numerical inferiority by catching the enemy unawares, and before further Parliamentarian reinforcements could increase their superiority in numbers.|$|E
500|$|In her memoir, Stanton {{credits the}} Cadys' neighbor, Rev. Simon Hosack, with {{strongly}} encouraging her intellectual development and academic abilities {{at a time}} when she felt these were undervalued by her father. Writing of her brother Eleazar's death in 1826, Stanton remembers trying to comfort her father, saying that she would try to be all her brother had been. At the time, her father's response devastated Stanton: [...] "Oh, my daughter, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> were a boy!" [...] Understanding from this that her father valued boys above girls, Stanton tearfully took her disappointment to Hosack, whose firm belief in her abilities counteracted her father's perceived disparagement. Hosack went on to teach Stanton Greek, encouraged her to read widely, and ultimately bequeathed to her his own Greek lexicon along with other books. His confirmation of her intellectual abilities strengthened Stanton's confidence and self-esteem.|$|E
500|$|Zaion: <b>I</b> <b>Wish</b> <b>You</b> Were Here had a mixed reception. Patrick king of Anime Fringe wrote, [...] "On the surface, it {{may appear}} to be merely another sci-fi mecha action show. However, Zaion {{introduced}} apocalyptic themes similar to those found in Michael Crichton's novel Andromeda Strain and the film 28 Days Later". According to King, the real story of Zaion occurs when Yuuji and Ai develop their relationship, and [...] "we begin to think less of the nanomachine technology and viral invasion of the planet and focus more upon the potential love between these two lonely people, trapped in a labyrinth devoid of an exit". The series was produced with high audio and visual qualities, and was designed with [...] "plausible technical details". King also praised the fitting soundtrack, which was composed by Kenji Kawai and incorporated the sounds of progressive rock.|$|E
60|$|TWISDEN. Mrs. Dedmond, I told <b>you</b> {{once that}} <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> well. Though you have {{called me a}} coward, I still do that. For God's sake, think--before it's too late.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is exactly}} what <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> to tell Mr. Hebblethwaite," [...] Norgate remarked, nodding pleasantly. [...] "I {{just want you to}} recall the {{circumstances}} of my first visit here." ...|$|R
6000|$|SHE: [...] "Did {{you suppose}} that because I first took lessons of you from- -from--an enthusiasm for art, and then {{continued}} them for--for-- amusement, that <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> {{to make love}} to me?" ...|$|R
500|$|After its inaugural engagement, {{the band}} {{remained}} in the mainland United States for several months, performing at other public events. A concert at the New York Hippodrome met with a [...] "rousing reception" [...] in which [...] "encore after encore" [...] was demanded, the band finally concluding with the overture from Tannhäuser followed by the Stars and Stripes Forever. On April 17, 1909, the band returned to Washington {{at the request of}} Helen Taft to perform at the opening of West Potomac Park. Later, it appeared in Seattle at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition to herald the arrival of President Taft for his inspection of the fairgrounds. The band then traveled to San Francisco, California to depart for the return voyage to the Philippines. As their troopship was departing, Taft ordered his own vessel to pull alongside. Seeing the president's ship approach, the band struck up Hail to the Chief prompting Taft to shout back [...] "goodbye, boys – <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> a pleasant voyage!" ...|$|E
500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> would give him credit because he did a very good job. It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E
500|$|Baseball people revere Hoffman for how {{he treats}} people. [...] Ausmus says Hoffman {{goes out of}} his way to engage fans. [...] Beyond shaking hands or signing autographs, he has {{extended}} conversations with fans who want to talk baseball. When Hoffman passed on the Indians in free agency to stay with the Padres, he still sent an autographed jersey as a baby gift to then-Indians manager Eric Wedge. After Hoffman saved the game to clinch the NL West on the last day of the 1996 season, he called Randy Smith, who traded for Hoffman as Padre GM before moving on to the Detroit Tigers. [...] "Randy, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> were here", Hoffman said. [...] "You're a part of this." [...] While celebrating his record setting 479th save against the Pirates, Hoffman tipped his cap to the Pittsburgh dugout, particularly Pirates manager Jim Tracy, who managed Hoffman in Cincinnati's Double-A Chattanooga farm team in 1991 after he was converted to a pitcher. Despite losing his role as a closer in his final season, Hoffman took pleasure in supporting his teammates and [...] "not being a cancer just because I was having trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't {{you get my}} message?" [...] he asked. [...] "I {{told the}} groom <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> to wait for my return. I sent a note to my sister, in case he made any mistake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Prevost {{does not}} {{understand}} the affair,' continued Lord Eskdale. 'Why <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> to come down here, Leander, was not to receive the applause of my cousin and his guests, but to form their taste.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{appreciate}} that in you!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> to know it. <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> to know," [...] she added, a little unsteadily, [...] "how much I admire {{you for what}} you are doing. They are afraid of you--they will crush you if they can." ...|$|R
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} the Griffin family {{watching}} television. A commercial for local auditions of the syndicated game show Family Feud is shown, prompting {{them to try}} out the next day. The Griffins are chosen for the show and reach the final round. During a fight with Richard Dawson about welching on the prize money, Peter hits his head. This causes him to forget everything about his life, including his family and friends. Lois tries to jog his memory by reintroducing him to his old self, including his children and his sex life. Unfortunately, this causes Peter to believe that he's free to {{have sexual relations with}} others in his newfound [...] "bachelorhood." [...] Lois had earlier told him that it is inappropriate to have sex with his children - in response, Meg attempts an incest joke ("Well, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> would've told him that BEFORE he lost his memory!"). Most of the family lambaste her for this and Chris kicks her out of the room. Deeply angered, Lois decides to move out, taking the kids. When Quagmire finds out, he jumps on the opportunity to pursue a relationship with Lois.|$|E
500|$|... "Pink Matter" [...] is a bluesy lament with {{themes of}} sex and betrayal, as its narrator struggles between {{pleasure}} and universal meaning. Its lyrics allude to philosophical conundrums, extraterrestrial life, Japanese manga comics, and cotton candy. The playful [...] "Forrest Gump" [...] likens the titular film character to an adolescent crush, with homoerotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, and allusions to scenes in the film. It has a bright, Motown-inspired chorus, a simple rhythmic cadence, gently strummed guitar, wistful vocals, and a perkily whistled coda. The skit [...] "End" [...] depicts an exchange between Ocean and a woman as they make love {{in the backseat of}} a car with his 2012 song [...] "Voodoo" [...] playing over the stereo. She says to him, [...] "You're special. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> could see what I see", repurposing a line from the 2006 film ATL, and Ocean leaves the car in response, walks home through the rain, and sets his keys down with a sigh. The lighthearted, lovelorn [...] "Golden Girl" [...] has up-tempo synths, gradual fades, and Tyler, The Creator rapping in a low-pitched, demonic voice. It is about a girl that provides salvation and peace of mind for the narrator, who likens her to an island.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Mind Over Murder", Peter spends so {{much time}} inside his house that [...] "all the TV {{programs}} are starting to mesh together". The example shown is Homicide: Life on Sesame Street, which mixes [...] with Sesame Street. Later in the episode, Bert is a gruff cop living with Ernie, who are shown as a bickering pair. In this scene, Ernie says [...] "Bert, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't drink so much." [...] Which Bert responds with [...] "Well Ernie, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't eat cookies in the damn bed!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot {{allow you}} to speak thus. I knew your trials at home when first <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> to be my son's wife, and my opinion is unchanged, except by my {{increased}} wish to have the first claim to you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{you must}} not {{understand}} me so much as to make much difference; for your conduct as my architect is perfect. But I must not linger longer, though <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>you</b> to know this news from my very own lips.' ...|$|R
