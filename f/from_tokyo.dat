By 1953 the JAL network extended northward <b>from</b> <b>Tokyo</b> to Sapporo and Misawa, and westward to Nagoya, Osaka, Iwakuni and Fukuoka.|$|E
5|$|Japanese radio {{intercepts}} did notice {{an increase}} in both American submarine activity and message traffic. This information was in Yamamoto's hands prior to the battle. Japanese plans, however, were not changed: Yamamoto, at sea in , assumed Nagumo had received the same signal <b>from</b> <b>Tokyo,</b> and did not communicate with him by radio, {{so as not to}} reveal his position. These messages were, contrary to earlier historical accounts, also received by Nagumo before the battle began. For reasons which remain unclear, Nagumo did not alter his plans or take additional precautions.|$|E

5|$|All SAS Commuter {{services}} in Northern Norway were {{taken over by}} Widerøe in October 2002. Norwegian Air Shuttle took over the routes to Alta and Tromsø from 1 April 2003, but already {{by the start of}} operations announced they would retire their fleet of Fokker 50 aircraft, resign from short-haul routes and become a low-cost airline. Widerøe won the subsequent tender and started operating to Lakselv from 1 January 2004. SAS Braathens introduced low-frequency summer services from Oslo from 2006, which was kept for three seasons. SAS cited too low ridership from foreign tourists as the reason for the closure. Widerøe took over SAS Ground Services' operations at Banak in 2008. Norwegian introduced a new summer seasonal route from Oslo to Lakselv from 2011. Outgoing charter services started in 2012 to Burgas and Antalya. Scandinavian Airlines operated one charter flight <b>from</b> <b>Tokyo</b> and back in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Charlesworth's {{workload}} at BCOF increased considerably {{with the}} outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 and the need to supply the RAAF's contribution to the conflict, chiefly No.77 Squadron. In October, following the death in combat of Squadron Leader Lou Spence, Charlesworth temporarily transferred <b>from</b> <b>Tokyo</b> to Iwakuni so that he could administer No.77 Squadron and its ancillaries until No.91 (Composite) Wing was formed to take over the task. Upon his return to Australia in June 1951, he was promoted to acting air vice marshal and appointed AOC Southern Area, headquartered in Albert Park, Melbourne. Towards the end of his tenure, the RAAF's wartime area command system was transformed into a structure based on function rather than geography. As a result, Southern Area was re-formed as Training Command in October 1953. In 1954 he returned to the UK to command RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, JAL {{was hit by}} {{the effects}} of Japan's recession, {{increased}} foreign competition and the strengthening of the Japanese Yen, JAZ was given a new role to help reduce costs. The airline obtained the license to operate scheduled services on July 30, 1999 and would operate as a scheduled carrier on a wet-lease basis for JAL. It would operate on high-density low yield tourist routes in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly the Japan–Hawaii services; with a fleet of four McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and five Boeing 747s. On October 1, the airline {{changed its name to}} JALways Co., Ltd. and operated its first scheduled passenger service <b>from</b> <b>Tokyo</b> to Kona and Honolulu.|$|E

5|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{there have been}} moves towards greater {{modernisation}} and standardisation, with large purchases of new rolling stock from companies like Alstom and China CNR Corporation, as well as smaller orders of second hand rolling stock, which {{the government of the}} City of Buenos Aires claims are temporary measures while those lines are modernised to be able to incorporate more modern rolling stock. Such stock has been acquired <b>from</b> <b>Tokyo,</b> Nagoya, and Madrid. From 2013 to 2019, 468 new cars are set to arrive while 232 are receiving refurbishment, bringing {{the average age of the}} fleet to 22 years in 2016, down from 34 in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Nanako Kato, a {{spokesperson}} from Sony Computer Entertainment, addressed the matter <b>from</b> <b>Tokyo.</b> She {{pointed out that}} historical buildings are often used in entertainment, such as in iconic movie scenes involving Godzilla and the Tokyo Tower and King Kong in Manhattan. She acknowledged {{the church in the}} game holds a resemblance to Manchester Cathedral, but that the point was to depict a backdrop of an old church, not to illustrate a specific church. She added that Sony understands why the Church of England was offended especially because of its efforts to reduce the serious problem of gun violence in Manchester. She did not answer on whether Sony would donate money to the Cathedral's anti-gun program as the Church has demanded. At the time, over 2million copies of the game had been sold.|$|E
5|$|Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka flew <b>from</b> <b>Tokyo</b> on 5 April to Tokuyama {{in a final}} {{attempt to}} {{convince}} the assembled commanders of the Combined Fleet—including Admiral Itō—to accept the plan. Upon first hearing of the proposed operation (it had been kept secret from most of them), the Combined Fleet commanders and captains unanimously joined Admiral Itō in rejecting it {{for the same reasons}} that he had expressed. Admiral Kusaka then explained that the Navy's attack would help divert U.S. aircraft away from the Army's planned kamikaze attacks on the U.S. fleet at Okinawa. He also explained that Japan's national leadership, including the emperor, were expecting the Navy to make their best effort to support the defense of Okinawa.|$|E

5|$|A {{version for}} PC was {{developed}} by Square's Costa Mesa offices. Square invested in a PC version so they could reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square's deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled {{by a team of}} 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but including help <b>from</b> <b>Tokyo.</b> Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished. The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game's code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version's five different game engines, leading to delays. The PC version came with a license for Yamaha Corporation's software synthesizer S-YXG70, allowing high-quality sequenced music despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to XG format files was done by Yamaha.|$|E

During these fights, Sanosuke's right hand is permanently damaged from the overuse Futae no Kiwami. and overcomes this disability when he discovers using both hands in succession which lessens the impact to his damaged hand. After protecting his family, he returns to Tokyo to rescue Kaoru with his friends.

The manga ends with a letter from Sanosuke to his friends that he is returning to Japan to be reunited with them.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} Japan's formal {{surrender}} in Tokyo Bay, Hashimoto {{was promoted to}} his final rank of commander. On 20 November, he was given command of the destroyer Yukikaze, among the few Imperial Navy ships to survive the war, and assigned to repatriation duties, returning troops to Japan from overseas. Before Hashimoto could begin his new duties, however, he was summoned by the United States military to be a {{witness for the prosecution}} in the court-martial against Indianapolis commander Captain Charles B. McVay III, who was on trial on charges of negligence leading to the ship's sinking. On 9 December 1945 he was transported <b>from</b> <b>Tokyo</b> to Oakland, California aboard an aircraft of the Naval Air Transport Service. Hashimoto was assured he would be treated as a naval officer instead of a prisoner of war or war criminal, but he remained under guard during his time in the United States and was not allowed to leave his hotel, as his appearance had been front page news that day in the New York Times and in other newspapers. The next day he arrived in Washington, D.C. where hearings were taking place. For the duration of his time in the United States, he spoke through translator Francis Earl Eastlake from the Office of Naval Intelligence.|$|E
