5|$|Ripken's power, {{which led}} to records such as most home runs by a shortstop and 13th place in career doubles, had consequences. His {{propensity}} to drive the ball often led to his grounders <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> fielders quickly for tailor-made double-play balls. In 1999, Ripken passed Hank Aaron as the player who had grounded into the most double plays in his career. Ripken is third on the fielding side for double plays by a shortstop (1565, behind Omar Vizquel's 1734 and Ozzie Smith's 1590).|$|E

5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line increased the number of visitors, as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E

The ship's helicopter (called Humphrey) took medical aid into the hills to assist people who were cut off from <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> other help by fallen trees. The ship also used its radio systems to broadcast news and music to the island to inform the population of what was being done and how to get assistance.

5|$|Hobbs was an {{occasional}} medium-paced bowler who bowled a good length {{and made the}} ball swing. Some critics judged {{him to be a}} potentially good bowler, but both Surrey and England were reluctant for him to bowl regularly, fearing it would affect his batting. As a fielder, Hobbs improved greatly from his early days. He fielded in the covers and was expert in cutting off potential runs and returning the ball quickly to the wicket-keeper. Contemporaries believed him {{to be one of the}} best cover fielders there had been, and remarked on his powers of anticipation in <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> the ball. They also noted he sometimes deceived batsmen with his casual attitude and occasional deliberate mis-fields; these would be followed by very sharp fielding which often produced a run out.|$|E

5|$|In September 1915, the Machine Gun Corps (MGC) {{was formed}} to provide heavy machine-gun teams after a {{proposal}} was made to the War Office {{for the formation of}} a single specialist machine-gun company for each infantry brigade—a goal to be achieved by withdrawing guns and gun teams from the battalions. Created in October 1915, the MGC consisted of infantry machine-gun companies, cavalry machine-gun squadrons and motor machine-gun batteries. In the trenches, the Corps' guns were deployed with an interlocking field of fire and proved to be a devastating defensive weapon against attacking infantry. They were also used in an indirect fire support role, in which they fired over the heads and from the flanks of the advancing infantry and behind the German trenches to stop reinforcements and supplies from <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> the front.|$|E
