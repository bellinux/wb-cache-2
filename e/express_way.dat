There {{is also an}} East-West <b>Express</b> <b>Way,</b> which goes from {{the city to the}} nearby industrial centres of Contagem and Betim (together having a population of ca. 900,000), and Anel Rodoviário, a kind of [...] "beltway" [...] - indeed it is not circumferential, but connects many highways, such as the federal (BR-ones) so it is not necessary for a large number of cars and trucks to pass through the city centre. Many of these roads are in poor condition, but in the last years many revitalization and rebuilding projects have been started.|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{considerable}} hurdle of giving a registered owner notice was introduced, the particular requirements of adverse possession were reasonably straight forward. First, under Schedule 1, paragraphs 1 and 8 of the Limitation Act 1980, {{the time when}} adverse possession began was when [...] "possession" [...] was taken. This {{had to be more}} than something temporary or transitory, such as simply storing goods on a land for a brief period. But [...] "possession" [...] did not require actual occupation. So in Powell v McFarlane, it was held to be [...] "possession" [...] when Mr Powell, from age 14, let his cows roam into Mr McFarlane's land. The second requirement, however, was that there needed to be an intention to possess the land. Mr Powell lost his claim because simply letting his cows roam was an equivocal act: it was only later that there was evidence he intended to take possession, for instance by erecting signs on the land and parking a lorry. But this had not happened long enough for the 12 year time limit on McFarlane's claim to have expired. Third, possession is not considered [...] "adverse" [...] if the person is there with the owner's consent. For example, in BP Properties Ltd v Buckler, Dillon LJ held that Mrs Buckler could not claim adverse possession over land owned by BP because BP had told her she could stay rent free for life. Fourth, under the Limitation Act 1980 sections 29 and 30, the adverse possessor must not have acknowledged the title of the owner in any <b>express</b> <b>way,</b> or the clock starts running again. However, the courts have interpreted this requirement flexibly.|$|E

There has of late years arisen a feeling among masses of the best of our English ladies that this feminine propensity should be checked. We are told that unmarried women may be respectable, which we always knew; that they may be useful, which we also acknowledge--thinking still that, if married, they would be more useful; and that they may be happy, which we trust--feeling confident, however, that they might in another position be more happy. But the question is not only as to the respectability, usefulness, and happiness of womankind, but as to that of men also. If women can do without marriage, can men do so? And if not, how are the men to get wives, if the women elect to remain single? ...|$|E

Two-dimensional numer-ical simulations for investigating velocity field around elevated <b>express</b> <b>ways</b> over street canyons are performed. The governing equations for incompressible airflow are discretized by using finite volume method (FVM) and the SIMPLE algorithm is used to solve these discretized equations. The effects of elevated expressways on airflow were analyzed in different positions over street canyons and different street canyon geometries. Results show that the elevated <b>express</b> <b>ways</b> and street canyon geometries strongly influence wind field in street canyons...|$|R

During the winter 2006 - 2007, {{measurements of the}} wear were carried out at several control sections {{in the region of}} Stockholm. The aim of these measurements was to study: - the amount of wear caused by studded tyres on urban streets in Stockholm, - the amount of wear caused by studded tyres on <b>express</b> <b>ways</b> outside Stockholm, - the number of private cars using studded tyres, - the relevance of the wear prediction model when used for urban streets. The result of the study shows that the wear of the asphalt wearing courses on the <b>express</b> <b>ways</b> around Stockholm has increased during the last few years even after compensation with respect to the increased amount of traffic. This means that every vehicle equipped with studded tyres wears away more material {{from the surface of the}} asphalt wearing course. One reason for this is that less wearing resistant aggregates have been used in the wearing courses on the <b>express</b> <b>ways</b> around Stockholm the last few years. Together with an increased amount of traffic it results in deeper wearing ruts compared with the winters in the beginning of this century. The rut depth caused by the traffic with studded tyres was 2 - 3 mm in the winter 2006 / 2007...|$|R
