40|$|Na década de 60, começaram a ser utilizadas técnicas e sincronização do estro, e durante os últimos trinta anos tem sido despertado o interesse do desenvolvimento de métodos para sincronizar o estro de ovelhas. Na maioria das vezes a IA está associada à um protocolo de sincronização do estro podendo assim ser realizada a Inseminação Artificial em Tempo Fixo (IATF). Três experimentos foram realizados com objetivo de avaliar a influência do efeito macho e tipos de rufião, reutilização do dispositivo e o método de inseminação utilizado, na sincronização do estro através do uso de dispositivos intra-vaginais (CIDR®- Control Internal Drog Release), associado com a aplicação {{intramuscular}} de eCG e PGF 2, sobre a taxa detecção e tempo médio para aparecimento do estro, taxa de prenhez na IATF e no primeiro estro após a sincronização. Exp. I: Foram utilizadas 270 ovelhas, separadas em três tratamentos: SM = (controle) sem rufiões; DL= recebeu rufiões com Desvio lateral peniano e o VS= recebeu rufiões vasectomizados. Os tratamentos foram submetidos ao mesmo protocolo, CIDR® por 7 d, aplicação de 300 UI de eCG e 6, 71 mg de Dinoprost trometamina, na retirada do CIDR. As ovelhas foram submetidas a IATF pelo método transcervical em 55 h após a retirada do CIDR. EXP. II: Foram utilizadas 275 ovelhas, divididas em 4 tratamentos: 7 N= 7 d com CIDR novo; 7 U= 7 d com CIDR já usado por 7 d; 11 N= 11 d com CIDR novo; 11 U= 11 d com CIDR já usado por 7 d. No dia da retirada do CIDR (D 7 ou D 11) foi realizada a aplicação de 300 UI de eCG e 6, 71 mg de Dinoprost trometamina. As ovelhas foram submetidas a IATF pelo método transcervical, 49 h após a retirada do CIDR. Exp. III: Foram utilizadas 247 ovelhas, divididas em 4 tratamentos: MN= as ovelhas foram sincronizadas e submetidas a monta natural com carneiros; IATF = as ovelhas foram submetidas a IATF por laparoscopia 48 h após a retirada do CIDR; IATF+GnRH= as ovelhas foram submetidas a IATF por laparoscopia + 0, 05 mg de Gonadorelina, quando 50 % das ovelhas apresentaram sinais de estro; IA= as ovelhas foram inseminadas por laparoscopia no sistema AM/PM, 12 h após o início dos sinais de estro. Todos os tratamentos foram submetidos ao mesmo protocolo, CIDR por 11 dias, aplicação de 300 UI de eCG e 6, 31 mg de Dinoprost trometamina, na retirada do CIDR. Nos experimentos I e II as ovelhas foram submetidas ao repasse com carneiros por 20 dias. O delineamento utilizado foi de blocos incompletos ao acaso, analisados pelo teste do Qui-quadrado e Tukey (estro). A taxa de detecção de estro no tratamento IATF (exp. III) foi de 59, 7 % sendo menor que os demais tratamentos (P 0, 05). O efeito macho e o tipo de macho não apresentaram diferença na IATF. O protocolo de 11 dias, mostrou-se eficiente em induzir o estro em 79 % das ovelhas sincronizadas. A IA realizada 12 h após o estro propiciou, índice de prenhez semelhante à monta natural, proveniente do estro sincronizado. In the 60 s, estrus synchronization techniques {{began to}} be used, and during the last 30 years has attracted the interest of developing new methods to synchronize estrus in ewes. Three experiments were performed to determine: I) influence of male effect and type of teaser; II) Effect of new and used CIDR® (Control Internal Drug Release) with different time of implant; III) Different time to perform IA after CIDR removal and comparison of laparoscopy method with natural breed, on heat detection and onset of estrus and pregnancy rate of ewes. Exp. I: 270 ewes were used, divided into three treatments: SM = (control) without teaser; DL = teaser with lateral penis deviation and VS = vasectomized teaser. All ewes were subjected to the same protocol: CIDR® for 7 days and received im. 300 UI of eCG plus 6. 71 mg <b>tromethamine</b> <b>dinoprost</b> at CIDR withdrawal. Ewes were artificially inseminated by transcervical method, 55 h after CIDR removal. There was no difference on onset of estrus for LD (55. 7 %) and VS (50. 5 %). Similarly, the distribution of estrus was similar (P> 0. 05) between treatments, where the averages were of 45 : 01 ± 14 : 30 h for LD 12 : 10 h and 44 : 00 ± 12 : 10 h for VS. Pregnancy rate did not differ (P> 0. 05) among treatments and was 34. 0, 34. 4 and 35. 0 % for LD, VS and SM, respectively. The male effect showed no influence on pregnancy rate when fixed-time artificial insemination was used. EXP. II: 275 ewes were used and divided into 4 treatments: 7 N = 7 d with new CIDR; 7 U = 7 d with already used CIDR for 7 d; 11 N = 11 d with new CIDR; 11 U = 11 d with CIDR already used for 7 d. On {{the withdrawal of the}} CIDR (D 7 or D 11) ewes received im. 300 IU of eCG plus 6. 71 mg <b>tromethamine</b> <b>dinoprost</b> at the time of CIDR removal. Ewes were submitted to FTAI, using the transcervical method, 49 h after CIDR withdrawal. Total pregnancy rate in treatment 11 N was higher (86. 6 %, P = 0. 03) as compared with treatment 7 U (71. 4 %). The protocols for estrus synchronization of 7 and 11 d were effective in inducing the expression of estrus. The reuse of CIDR did not influence the rate of onset and average time to onset of estrus and pregnancy rate in the FTAI. Exp. III: 247 ewes were used and divided in four treatments: MN = ewes were synchronized and exposed to males during 20 d; IATF = ewes were synchronized and inseminated by laparoscopy 48 h after CIDR removal; AITF+GnRH= ewes were synchronized and inseminated by laparoscopy using 0. 05 mg gonadorelin, when 50 % of the ewes showed signs of estrus; AI = ewes received im. 300 IU of eCG plus 6. 71 mg <b>tromethamine</b> <b>dinoprost</b> at the time of CIDR removal and were inseminated by laparoscopy, 12 h after the onset of signs of estrus. All treatments were subjected to the same protocol: CIDR for 11 days, intramuscular injection of 300 UI of eCG plus 6. 31 mg <b>tromethamine</b> <b>dinoprost</b> at CIDR removal. In all experiments ewes were exposed to rams (natural breeding), 10 days after FTAI. The experimental design was an incomplete randomized block, analyzed by chi- square and Tukey (estrus).

The animals were divided into two groups: the TAI (n = 21) underwent a fixed-time artificial insemination protocol (TAI), and 10 days after insemination, the device was fixed to the cows. In the PG group (n = 37) prostaglandin (<b>dinoprost</b> <b>tromethamine)</b> 25 mg/animal/IM was administered, and then the device was put in place. These cows were then monitored by ultrasound over a period of 28 days to verify the development of the corpus luteum.

No group effect was detected (P> 0. 05) on the efficiency of visual detection nor on that of the auxiliary device. Neither was there observed any difference between the efficiency of visual detection of estrus and that of the device (P> 0. 05). The auxiliary tool for the detection of estrus, (Estrotect ®), proved to be just as effective as visual detection.

Intravaginal sponge containing 40 mg FGA was inserted for 13 days and an injection of 600 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) was administered for goats of FGA and FGA-PGF groups at the time of sponge removal (day 0). In addition, goats of FGA-PGF group were injected with 10 mg <b>dinoprost</b> <b>tromethamine</b> (PGF₂α) on day 0. Five fertile local-Damascus cross bucks were turned-in with all goats on day 0. Blood and milk samples were collected from all goats on days - 13 (beginning of experiment), - 6, 0, 1, 2, 7, 13 and 20 (end of the experiment). Four-year old and second-parity goats had significantly higher (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) SCC of both udder halves than 2 - and 3 -year old and first-parity goats, respectively. There was a significant effect (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) for treatment and number of kids born in the last kidding season on SCC of both udder halves. Neither estradiol nor progesterone concentrations were correlated with SCC in goats in this experiment. The SCC of both udder halves and left udder halves in goats of the control and FGA groups, respectively, increased significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) after sponge removal and buck introduction when compared with day 0, with no differences in the FGA-PGF group. This increase in SCC of the control and FGA groups coincided with peak estrus behavior. However, SCC was far below the upper limit of the current standard for normal milk. In conclusion, induction of estrus with progestagen based programs and buck introduction may cause temporary significant increase in SCC. However, the SCC values during this period of temporary increase were still in the range of acceptable values for normal milk. With the current standards for SCC of 1, 000, 000 /ml as legal limit for abnormal milk control programs in goats, estrus synchronization programs and the estrus status should not be considered when bulk-tank milk SCC is being investigated.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of eCG and temporary calf removal (TCR) associated with progesterone (P 4) treatment on the dynamics of follicular growth, CL size, and P 4 concentrations in cyclic (n = 36) and anestrous (n = 30) Nelore cows. Cyclic (C) and anestrous (A) cows were divided into three groups. The control group received 2 mg of estradiol benzoate via intramuscular (IM) injection and an intravaginal device containing 1. 9 g of P 4 on Day 0. On Day 8, the device was removed, and the animals received 12. 5 mg of <b>dinoprost</b> <b>tromethamine</b> IM. After 24 hours, the animals received 1 mg of estradiol benzoate IM. In the eCG group, cows received the same treatment described for the control group but also received 400 UI of eCG at the time of device removal. In the TCR group, calves were separated from the cows for 56 hours after device removal. Ultrasound exams were performed every 24 hours after device removal until the time of ovulation and 12 days after ovulation to measure the size of the CL. On the same day as the CL measurement, blood was collected to determine the plasma P 4 level. Statistical analyses were performed with a significance level of P ≤ 0. 05. In cyclic cows, the presence of the CL at the beginning of protocol resulted in a smaller follicle diameter at the time of device removal (7. 4 ± 0. 3 mm in cows with CL vs. 8. 9 ± 0. 4 mm in cows without CL; P = 0. 03). All cows ovulated within 72 hours after device removal. Anestrous cows treated with eCG or TCR showed follicle diameter at fixed-timed artificial insemination (A-eCG 10. 2 ± 0. 3 and A-TCR 10. 3 ± 0. 5 mm) and follicular growth rate (A-eCG 1. 5 ± 0. 2 and A-TCR 1. 3 ± 0. 1 mm/day) similar to cyclic cows (C-eCG 11. 0 ± 0. 6 and C-TCR 12. 0 ± 0. 5 mm) and (C-eCG 1. 4 ± 0. 2 and C-TCR 1. 6 ± 0. 2 mm/day, respectively; P ≤ 0. 05). Despite the similarities in CL size, the average P 4 concentration was higher in the A-TCR (9. 6 ± 1. 4 ng/mL) than in the A-control (4. 0 ± 1. 0 ng/mL) and C-TCR (4. 4 ± 1. 0 ng/mL) groups (P < 0. 05). From these results, we conclude that eCG treatment and TCR improved the fertility of anestrous cows by providing follicular growth rates and size of dominant follicles similar to cyclic cows. Additionally, TCR increases the plasma concentrations of P 4 in anestrous cows...|$|E
