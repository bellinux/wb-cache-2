25|$|At the 1927 International Radio-Telegraph Conference the United Kingdom was {{allocated}} radio callsign prefixes B, G, M, VP, VQ and VR. Within {{this new}} allocation the United Kingdom {{continued to use}} the prefix G- for all aircraft but the sequence was restarted at G-AAAA, which continued into the 21st century. The <b>first</b> <b>registration</b> in the sequence, G-AAAA, was allocated to a de Havilland Gipsy Moth, registered on 30 July 1928 to Geoffrey de Havilland. At first nearly all registrations were issued in sequential alphabetical order but since the 1970s personalised ("out of sequence") registrations are available using any four-letter combination. Except in very rare circumstances, no registration is ever re-issued to a different aircraft. Countries in the British Empire that had used the G- prefix were allocated new two-letter allocations.|$|E

The foundation stallion of the breed was an Arabian/Appaloosa/Shetland pony cross with Appaloosa markings named Black Hand.

In 1954, Boomhower and a group of associations founded the Pony of the Americas Club, with Black Hand receiving the <b>first</b> <b>registration</b> number. A year later, twelve ponies and twenty-three members had been registered.
