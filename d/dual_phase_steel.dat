40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{mechanical}} properties of <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steel,</b> {{it is crucial to}} adjust the microstructure, consisting of martensite and ferrite, in an optimal way. To achieve this, both the applied heat treatment as well as the influence of the alloying elements has to be taken into account. Regarding the alloying elements, not only the average concentration levels have to be considered, but the local concentration levels are of great importance, too. The present thesis focuses on the influence of two different microstructures obtained after hot rolling on the properties of a completely processed <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steel.</b> The first microstructure consists of a ferrite matrix with single carbides, martensite and bainite regions embedded in (B+M). The second one consists of a ferrite matrix with pearlite islands as well as single carbides embedded in (P+F). In order to analyse the distribution of the substitutional elements in both microstructures, they were examined by using extrcation replicas and microprobe measurements. It was found {{that in the case of}} the P+F microstructure the single iron carbides as well as the iron carbides in pearlite were enriched with Mn and Cr. Additionally, some regions were depleted of Mn and Cr. In the case of the B+M microstructure it this was not the case. After the characterisation of the hot rolled state of the material, both microstructures were annealed in a dilatometer. Here, the heat treatment was adjusted in a way which is comparable to the one used by Thyssenkrupp-Steel Europe to create a <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steel.</b> During the applied heat treatment the material was reaustenized at 840 °C and cooled to room temperature afterwards. It was found that in the case of the P+F microstructure the reaustenization was not completed. This behaviour was contributed to the Mn depleted regions, which slowed down the transformation of bcc to fcc. In contrast to that, the B+M microstructure was completely reaustenized. Measuring of both microstructures during cooling down the start temperature of the growth of ferrite revealed that in the case of B+M ferrite formed at lower temperatures than in the case of P+F. In addition to that, the B+M microstructure had a higher martensite content. EBSD measurements which were performed after complete heat treatment revealed that the P+F <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steel</b> had a lower average GND density in ferrite compared to the B+M <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steel.</b> Thereby, the P+F <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steel</b> showed ferrite regions which had GND density compareable to the average GND density of ferrite of B+M and ferrite regions which had a significantly lower GND density. On the basis of further heat treatments, during which ferrite grew isothermally, the influence of the growth temperature of ferrite on its GND density was examined. It was proven that the average GND density of ferrite is inverse proportional to its growth temperature. An exceptional increase of the average GND density was found between 600 °C and 575 °C. This increase was much higher than the increase found between 650 °C and 600 °C or between 575 °C and 450 °C. Most likely a change in the growth mechanism of ferrite is responsible for the sudden increase of the average GND density. For 600 °C and higher temperatures a reconstructive growth mechanism is expected, for 575 °C and lower the growth mechanism seems to have a more displacive character. However, the shape of the grains, which is often related to the growth mechanism of the grains, changes between 500 °C and 450 °C from globular to acicular. An acicular shape of the grains is known to be typical for bainite. With the results of the last section it is possible to understand the inhomogeneous GND distribution found in the P+F <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steel</b> after complete heat treatment. In the case of the P+F <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steel,</b> ferrite grows at quite high temperatures (600 °C and higher) and lower temperatures. Since the GND density is inverse proportional to the growth temperature of ferrite, the GND density is distributed inhomogeneously in the ferrite. In the case of the B+M <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steel</b> all ferrite growths at 510 °C, which leads to a more homogeneous distribution of high GND values. The influence of the start distribution of Mn found in the hot rolled material was not only examined for the laboratory processed material but also for the material completely processed at ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe AG...|$|E
40|$|Manganese {{partitioning}} {{and mechanical}} properties of dual phase steels have been examined. The manganese partitioning coefficient increases to a limit with increasing isothermal holding time, {{and the final}} equilibrium partitioning coefficient decreases with increasing annealing temperature. The combination of diffusion equations in austenite and ferrite plus mass balance and austenite growth can give the manganese distribution in austenite and ferrite respectively, and the manganese partitioning coefficient at any isothermal holding time. The introduction of rolling during annealing or {{at the end of}} annealing can strengthen dual phase steels by elongating austenite and introducing internal stresses and dislocations, the magnitude of which depends on finishing rolling temperature and the timing of rolling during annealing. The tensile properties of as-rolled dual phase steels are strongly influenced by finishing rolling temperature and martensite volume fraction because of internal stresses and dislocation density, whereas those of post-rolling annealed steels depend on only martensite volume percentage. To model the heat-treatment for producing dual phase steels (“in-situ” <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steel),</b> a steel-steel composite is produced by incorporating high strength steel-wires into ductile steel sheets through hot-rolling (“artificial” <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steel).</b> The properties of the reinforcing wire, matrix steels, interfacial strength between wire and matrix steels and steel-steel composite are affected by the surface condition of wire, finishing rolling temperature, preform holding time at rolling temperature before rolling, and heat-treatment after fabrication of composites. Mileiko’s theory can predict the relationship between the steel-steel composite strength and the volume fraction of wire. But for dual phase steels, Mileiko’s theory can be applied only when martensite volume fraction is over 30 % because the residual stress, high dislocation density and carbide are produced at low temperature, at which low martensite volume fraction is obtained. Continuous wire composites can simulate the as-rolled <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steel</b> when the reinforcement content is over 30 %, but discontinuous wire composites can not simulate the post-rolling annealed <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steel...</b>|$|E

A solution towards lighter structures is to improve the mechanical properties while keeping a sufficient ductility for the forming operations. The aim of the thesis was to investigate the enhancement of the mechanical properties of metallic alloys by the refinement of the grain size while playing with other microstructural features {{in order to maintain the}} strain hardening, and thus the ductility, as high as possible. Various fine grained <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steels</b> were produced by severe plastic deformation followed by thermal treatment.

A new methodology, based on performing nano-indentation tests at different depth inside each <b>phases</b> of the <b>steels,</b> has been proposed in order to separate the different hardening contributions affecting the behaviour of the material. In order to gain a better understanding of the link between the fine grained microstructure and the flow properties, three models were developed introducing successively a richer and richer description of the microstructure.

40|$|Low alloyed <b>dual</b> <b>phase</b> <b>steels</b> are {{nowadays}} vogue in automotive parts. However, {{the local}} heat-input while (laser beam) welding {{may lead to}} distortions and residual stresses that may influence the component in-service behaviour. In order to better characterize material properties with respect to deformation and residual stresses, FE-simulations have been performed. Towards to short calculation times and an easy to handle experimental set-up for measurements for validation, smaller specimens to be welded are advantageous. After calculation of the temperature-field, the mechanical analysis is done using different strain hardening models under clamped and unclamped conditions. In addition, the influence of transformation plasticity at different boundary conditions is investigated. Results of this study provide valuable information for this steel {{to be used in}} complex welded components...|$|R
