25|$|Lawrence {{walked along}} Well Hall Road to the {{junction}} of Dickson Road to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> a bus coming {{and then went back}} towards the bus stop. Brooks was still on Well Hall Road, part way between Dickson Road and the roundabout with Rochester Way and Westhorne Avenue.|$|E
25|$|During the {{evacuation}} of the camp, Ian expresses his love for Louise. They talk about life choices and whether he would change them <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the future. Louise knows that she will agree {{to have a child}} with him despite knowing their fate: that Hannah will die, and Ian will leave them after she reveals that she knew this.|$|E
2500|$|Descartes also concedes {{two points}} that might {{allow for the}} {{possibility}} of his ability to make errors. [...] First, he notes that it is very possible that his limited knowledge prevents him from understanding why God chose to create him so he could make mistakes. [...] <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the things that God could see, with a complete and infinite scope, perhaps he would judge his ability to err as the best option. [...] He uses this point to attack the Aristotelian structure of causes. The final cause described by Aristotle are the [...] "what for" [...] of an object, but Descartes claims that because he is unable to comprehend completely the mind of God, it is impossible to understand completely the [...] "why" [...] through science â€” only the [...] "how".|$|E
60|$|Yet, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> his {{antagonist}}, {{neither could}} his antagonist now see him.|$|R
60|$|There {{is a way}} out {{of every}} thing. And there was surely {{a way out of}} this, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ho, ho, ho!" [...] shouted Jimmy Skunk. [...] "I {{wonder what}} Reddy Fox {{would have said}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> old Granny go down that hollow!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In a 2010 Vanity Fair interview, Vilanch {{was asked}} {{for whom he}} wrote the Oscars show jokes, replying: [...] "I write across the board. Every year it breaks down differently, {{depending}} on the host, but as we {{get closer to the}} date, all of the writers tend to be writing over each other. Everyone's contributing to everybody else's work. There are four of us writing the actual show, and you end up writing and rewriting so many things at the same time. So I do a little of everything. There's a lot of mileage involved in writing for the Academy Awards, you go through a lot of hoops." [...] When asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> himself doing the job for another 21 years, he replied: [...] "Absolutely. It's the greatest show on Earth. It's like asking somebody, 'Hey, would you like to play in the Super Bowl next year?' Did anybody get into football not to play in the Super Bowl? Does anybody get into show business not to do the biggest show in the world?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Labourer George Hutchinson, {{who knew}} Kelly, {{reported}} that she met him at about 2:00a.m. and asked him for a loan of sixpence. He claimed to be broke and that as Kelly went on her way she was approached by a man of [...] "Jewish appearance". Hutchinson later gave the police an extremely {{detailed description of the}} man right down to the colour of his eyelashes despite it being the middle of a dark winter night. He reported that he overheard them talking in the street opposite the court where Kelly was living; Kelly complained of losing her handkerchief, and the man gave her a red one of his own. Hutchinson claimed that Kelly and the man headed for her room, that he followed them, and that he saw neither one of them again, laying off his watch at about 2:45. Hutchinson's statement appears to be partly corroborated by laundress Sarah Lewis, who reported seeing a man watching the entrance to Miller's Court as she passed into it at about 2:30 to spend the night with some friends, the Keylers. Hutchinson claimed that he was suspicious of the man because although Kelly seemed to know him, his opulent appearance made him seem very unusual in that neighbourhood, but only reported this to the police after the inquest on Kelly had been hastily concluded. Abberline, the detective in charge of the investigation, thought Hutchinson's information was important and sent him out with officers to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the man again. Hutchinson's name does not appear again in the existing police records, and so {{it is not possible to}} say with certainty whether his evidence was ultimately dismissed, disproven, or corroborated. In his memoirs Walter Dew discounts Hutchinson on the basis that his sighting may have been on a different day, and not the morning of the murder. Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who got a good look at the killer was Jewish. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness. Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself, trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he may have just been an attention seeker who made up a story he hoped to sell to the press.|$|E
6000|$|What <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> this, his own skull, {{yellow and}} eroded? Two centuries old. Would he still speak? Would he speak, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it, the grinning, aged skull? What {{would there be}} for him to say, to tell the people? What message could he bring? ...|$|E
6000|$|After that Lewisham went on his southward way alone. He {{did not go}} {{straight}} to his room in Chelsea, but spent some hours in a street in Battersea, pacing to and fro {{in front of a}} possible house. His passion changed from savageness to a tender longing. <b>If</b> only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her to-night! <b>He</b> knew his own mind now. To-morrow he was resolved he would fling work to the dogs and meet her. The things Dunkerley had said had filled his mind with wonderful novel thoughts. <b>If</b> only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her now! ...|$|R
6000|$|O! <b>If</b> <b>he</b> had known, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had known! <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> {{the dagger}} in his hand, and the cruel wounds it {{struck in the}} {{faithful}} bleeding breast of his Little Dorrit! ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> {{what was}} {{happening}} below in the kitchens of the Mausoleum Club, Mr. Fyshe would have realized that just then it was turning into a most uncomfortable place.|$|R
60|$|Determined {{to solve}} the mystery, {{if it could be}} done, Mountjoy asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the doctor. No: Mr. Vimpany had gone out.|$|E
60|$|Violet {{wrote to}} John that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Theodora and Percy now, {{he would be}} {{completely}} satisfied as to their attachment and chances of happiness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Charles {{would be}} flattered <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the gracious {{way in which}} we receive his kindness," [...] said she. [...] "Be still, Roddy dear, or you will {{certainly}} wake him." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} side of the gardens lay the {{courtyard}} of the palace. There were gates in plenty communicating between them. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> but <b>see</b> Orestes, even alarm the guard in time!....|$|R
6000|$|OLD MAN. [...] They're demolish'd too-- [...] As <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> thro' {{casement}} glass! [...] The very red-breasts that so regular [...] Came to my Lady for {{her morning}} crumbs, [...] Won't know the window now! ...|$|R
6000|$|Estella laughed hysterically. Vivienne LeMar was grossly intoxicated. This {{woman whom}} Spencer Morgan worshipped, {{for whom he}} had forsaken her, was reeling about the room, {{laughing}} idiotically, talking wildly in a thick voice. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> but <b>see</b> her now! ...|$|R
60|$|He pointed {{into the}} night toward the {{northwest}} and stared as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> from where he stood that Bay of Bengal where--as he affirmed--he {{would be so much}} more at home.|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{the least}} sparkle of relief {{in her face}} now? No, he could see no such thing, even if that brave outside did not utterly put him away, and he were not looking beyond it and about it.|$|E
60|$|So {{there we}} sat, foodless and frightened, {{wondering}} what our old friend Kou-en would say <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> us now. By degrees hunger mastered all our other sensations {{and we began}} to turn longing eyes upon the headless body of the yak.|$|E
60|$|Will Brangwen sat down. He felt {{something}} strange in the atmosphere. He was dark browed, {{but his eyes}} had the keen, intent, sharp look, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> in the distance; which was a beauty in him, and which made Anna so angry.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Makely said, smiling: [...] "No, I don't {{think that}} was the {{brightest}} outlook in the world. No wonder he has brought back such gloomy impressions. I am sure that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> life under brighter auspices he would not have the ideas he has." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> her face, {{and study}} there {{the effect of}} that thrust of his, at least he {{observed}} the quiver that ran through her muffled figure, he caught the note of anger that throbbed in her reply--"And if that were so, what is't to thee?" ...|$|R
60|$|Conrade was {{in search}} of the deserter, but he applied himself heartily to the {{propulsion}} of aunt Ermine, informing Rose that Mr. Clare was no end of a man, much better than <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> and aunt Rachel was grown quite jolly.|$|E
60|$|Billy {{rose and}} walked boldly inside. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> no one within, {{then no one}} could see him once he was inside the door. Therefore, so {{reasoned}} Billy Byrne, he would have as good a chance as the occupants of the hut, should they prove to be enemies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{your home}} with that uncle of yours?" [...] She had {{heard so much}} of his family; but he had as yet spoken to her no word about Caroline. [...] "I wonder what he would say <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> you now leaning here and talking to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{caught up}} with me on the road home, and grinned as cheerfully as usual. But his grin could never deceive me again. I had seen the REAL Jonas. I {{wondered}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>see</b> the REAL PHIL--whom NOBODY, not even you, Anne, has ever seen yet.|$|R
60|$|The servant, however, {{stated that}} the young man would not make his {{appearance}} in the room where the party were sitting, and he declared he would go away <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> Santerre alone. The republican at length yielded, and followed the servant into a small sitting-room, where he found our friend, Adolphe Denot.|$|R
60|$|After this, at this moment, {{with such}} words ringing in his ears, Ralph {{found it to}} be {{impossible}} to expostulate with his father. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> only take his father's arm, and whisper a soft feminine word or two. He would be as happy as the day was long, <b>if</b> only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his father happy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] {{said the}} girl with another laugh, [...] "he might save me a trip to New York, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> my drawings." [...] Something, {{she did not know}} what, in Mrs. Burton's manner, made her ask: [...] "Have you heard from him lately? Perhaps he's given it up, too!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Think of it," [...] he urged, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> into me. [...] "You {{can make}} {{what you like}} of it. Press paragraphs, of course. But that's mechanical; why, even I could do it, if I had time. As for the rest, you'll be as free--as free as a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] the Shadow replied, {{as readily}} as before. [...] "He {{is very much}} afraid of you. You are Korong. You may any day {{supplant}} him. He {{would like to get}} rid of you, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his way. But till your time comes he dare not touch you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'To {{be ordered}} home just as I am making {{something}} of it, and see as many cases {{in ten years}} as I could in a month in town. Things are altered since his time, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> it. What {{was the use of}} giving me a first-rate education, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> meant to stick me down here?' ...|$|R
50|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} Hard West's gameplay is the reaction shot which replaces the overwatch mechanic of XCOM. Approaching an enemy up to point-blank range makes him automatically {{fire at the}} approaching player character <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> already <b>see</b> the player character before executing the move. Player characters are not protected from enemies by a reaction shot.|$|R
6000|$|... "As if {{a painted}} little {{marmoset}} were worth a man's heart! But Allen {{has always been}} infatuated about her, and there's a good deal at stake, though, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> it in the right fight, he is well quit of such a bubble of a creature. I wouldn't be saddled with it for all Belforest." ...|$|R
