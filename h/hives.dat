5|$|Bees {{have been}} kept in <b>hives</b> {{since at least the}} First Dynasty of Egypt, five {{thousand}} years ago, and man had been harvesting honey from the wild long before that. Fixed comb <b>hives</b> are used {{in many parts of the}} world and are made from any locally available material. In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and productiveness, various designs of hive are used which enable the combs to be removed for processing and extraction of honey. Quite apart from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and in many places <b>hives</b> are transported around the countryside to assist in pollination.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} of Africa, <b>hives</b> of African honeybees (A. mellifera scutellata) are being {{destroyed}} by parasitic workers of the Cape honeybee, A. m. capensis. These lay diploid eggs ("thelytoky"), escaping normal worker policing, leading to the colony's destruction; the parasites can then move to other <b>hives.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tina (McShera) {{arrives at}} a Victorian villa for a séance. <b>Hives</b> (Shearsmith) settles Tina before {{retrieving}} Talbot (Steadman), who arrives shrouded in black and carrying a doll. Talbot, an elderly woman with heavy cataracts, speaks in a high-pitched voice, unnerving Tina. When the séance begins, objects fly around the room, Talbot's voice becomes demonic and ectoplasm seeps from her mouth. <b>Hives</b> encourages Tina not to break the circle, but she does so when a blue-faced demon (Starkey) appears behind her. She is terrified until <b>Hives</b> reveals himself to be Terry, {{the host of a}} hidden camera programme called Scaredy Cam.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>H.I.V.E.</b> is {{featured}} in DC Universe Online. They are shown to serve Queen Bee when they attack S.T.A.R. Labs and LexCorp Exobyte Transports near the Metropolis Metrodome. She and the <b>H.I.V.E.</b> are in cahoots with Brainiac {{in order to}} deliver the stolen Exobytes to him. The players fight the <b>H.I.V.E.</b> again when Queen Bee hypnotizes Booster Gold. The <b>H.I.V.E.'s</b> foot soldiers consist of <b>H.I.V.E.</b> Drones, <b>H.I.V.E.</b> Foragers, <b>H.I.V.E.</b> Killer Bees, <b>H.I.V.E.</b> Recruits, <b>H.I.V.E.</b> Royal Drones, <b>H.I.V.E.</b> Stingers, <b>H.I.V.E.</b> Workers, Mortuary Bees, a <b>H.I.V.E.</b> Minder, and Major Honeygut.|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>hive's</b> {{management}} differs strongly {{from the}} tub shaped Greek <b>hive,</b> early publications about the Kenyan <b>hive</b> often mention the Greek <b>hive</b> as {{an inspiration for}} the Kenyan <b>hive.</b>|$|R
50|$|Feeders {{may exist}} outside the <b>hive,</b> be {{designed}} to fit certain <b>hive</b> designs, {{be an integral part}} of a <b>hive</b> design, or be used separately inside the <b>hive.</b> Feeders may attach to the side of the <b>hive,</b> or slot into the flight entrance, or placed above or below the nest inside the <b>hive</b> or as a purpose-built <b>hive</b> component.|$|R
5|$|<b>Hives</b> further {{recommended}} that a factory be built near Glasgow {{to take advantage}} of the abundant local work force and the supply of steel and forgings from Scottish manufacturers. In September 1939, the Air Ministry allocated ₤4,500,000 for a new Shadow factory. This government-funded and -operated factory was built at Hillington starting in June 1939 with workers moving into the premises in October, one month after the outbreak of war. The factory was fully occupied by September 1940. A housing crisis also occurred at Glasgow where <b>Hives</b> again asked the Air Ministry to step in.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, {{scientists}} from the University of Maryland and the US Department of Agriculture found {{that a combination of}} pesticides has been contaminating the pollen bees use to feed their <b>hives.</b> When researchers collected pollen from <b>hives</b> on the east coast, they discovered that it was contaminated (on average) with 9 different fungicides and pesticides, although scientists found a blend of 21 different agricultural chemicals in one sample of pollen. Eight ag chemicals were identified to be associated with increased risk of infection by Nosema ceranae.|$|E
5|$|Nell's story {{alternates}} {{between the}} perspectives of Nell Golightly, a seventeen-year-old girl, and the poet Rupert Brooke. The novel begins as Nell's father dies while tending to the family's bee <b>hives.</b> Because she is the oldest child and her mother is long dead, Nell Golightly decides finds {{a job as a}} maid at The Orchard, a boarding house and tea room outside of Cambridge which caters to the students at the University there. There she, along with several other young women, serves guests and cleans the facilities. She also helps a local beekeeper tend his <b>hives.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{researcher}} G. Ntenga then {{designed a}} transitional <b>hive,</b> in 1972, {{based on the}} plank <b>hive</b> that uses moveable top-bars. This <b>hive</b> is sometimes called the Tanzanian Transitional <b>Hive</b> in literature, and was the original Tanzanian top-bar <b>hive.</b> Ntenga's <b>hive</b> had very precise measurements. It used top-bars with either a centre groove, a V-shaped bevel, or flat surface. The top-bars had lugs that were narrower than the bar itself. The <b>hive</b> could take 28 combs. The <b>hive</b> was covered with two lids, each covering half the <b>hive.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} three major Tyranid <b>hive</b> fleets to date; <b>Hive</b> Fleet Behemoth and <b>Hive</b> Fleet Kraken of whom both were defeated, and <b>Hive</b> Fleet Leviathan, {{which is one of}} the current threats to the known galaxy. There are many other Tyranid <b>hive</b> fleets that have been {{destroyed}} or are still emerging, such as <b>Hive</b> Fleets Jormungand, Colossus, Tiamet, Scarabus, Ouroboros, Nemesis, Reatherus, Gorgon and Hydra among many others.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hive</b> {{management}} {{is a term}} used in beekeeping. The term describes all the intervention techniques a beekeeper may perform to ensure <b>hive</b> survival and to maximize <b>hive</b> production. <b>Hive</b> management techniques vary widely depending on the objectives. The most common objectives are: ...|$|R
5|$|B.integrifolia {{produces}} a dark amber-coloured honey of middling quality and therefore low commercial value. Despite this, {{the species is}} highly valued by beekeepers because it produces large amounts of pollen and nectar during autumn and winter, thus helping support <b>hives</b> {{at a time when}} little else is flowering.|$|E
5|$|For a {{small number}} of people, taking aspirin can result in {{symptoms}} resembling an allergic reaction, including <b>hives,</b> swelling, and headache. The reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance and is not a true allergy, but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an overdose.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have kept}} honey bee colonies, {{commonly}} in <b>hives,</b> for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from hives; bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees {{for sale to}} other beekeepers.|$|E
50|$|Worker bees fan the <b>hive,</b> cooling it with {{evaporated}} water {{brought by}} water carriers. They direct airflow into the <b>hive</b> {{or out of}} the <b>hive</b> depending on need.|$|R
50|$|In English {{speaking}} countries, the top-bar <b>hive</b> {{is usually}} {{mounted on a}} set of legs that lift the <b>hive</b> to a height that is comfortable for beekeepers. In African countries, the height of the <b>hive</b> is often also determined by the type of animal the <b>hive</b> is meant to be protected from.|$|R
50|$|Prisoner of the hornets, Maya learns of a hornet plan {{to attack}} her native <b>hive.</b> Maya {{is faced with}} the {{decision}} to either return to <b>hive</b> and suffer her due punishment, saving the <b>hive,</b> or leaving the plan unannounced, saving herself but destroying the <b>hive.</b> As May(a) bee expected, Maya, after severe pondering, makes the decision to return. In the <b>hive,</b> she announces the coming attack and is, totally unexpectedly, pardoned. The forewarned bees triumph over the hornet attack force. Maya, now a heroine of the <b>hive,</b> becomes a teacher, like Mrs. Cassandra and shares her experiences and wisdom with the future generation.|$|R
5|$|Production of the Rolls-Royce Merlin {{was driven}} by the forethought and {{determination}} of Ernest <b>Hives,</b> who at times was enraged by the apparent complacency and lack of urgency encountered in his frequent correspondence with Air Ministry and local authority officials. <b>Hives</b> was an advocate of shadow factories, and, sensing the imminent outbreak of war, pressed ahead with plans to produce the Merlin in sufficient numbers for the rapidly expanding Royal Air Force. Despite the importance of uninterrupted production, several factories were affected by industrial action. By {{the end of its}} production run in 1950, 168,176 Merlin engines had been built; over 112,000 in Britain and more than 55,000 under licence in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Though {{relatively}} short-lived, Nation of Ulysses' {{influence has}} been substantial: {{they have been}} cited as influences for bands such as The (International) Noise Conspiracy, The <b>Hives,</b> Thursday, Refused, Boysetsfire, Bikini Kill, Rocket From The Crypt, Antioch Arrow, The Locust, At The Drive-in, LCD Soundsystem, and Huggy Bear, among many others.|$|E
5|$|Another test {{known as}} a phototest is the most useful in {{identifying}} solar urticaria. In this test, one centimeter segments of skin are subject to varying amounts of UVA and UVB radiation {{in order to determine}} the specific dosage of the certain form of radiation that causes the urticaria to form. When testing for its less intense form (fixed solar urticaria), phototesting should be conducted only in the areas where the <b>hives</b> have appeared to avoid the possibility of getting false-negative results.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hive</b> frame or honey {{frame is}} a {{structural}} element in a beehive {{that holds the}} honeycomb or brood comb within the <b>hive</b> enclosure. The <b>hive</b> frame is {{a key part of}} the modern movable-comb <b>hive.</b> It can be removed in order to inspect the bees for disease or to extract the excess honey.|$|R

50|$|<b>Hive</b> (stylised as <b>HIVE)</b> is {{a custom}} ROM {{developed}} by Xolo and {{is built on}} the Android operating system v 4.4.4 (Kitkat). <b>Hive</b> is exclusive to Xolo devices and is not licensed to third-parties.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} Ministry of Education and the Higher Education Council, {{the two main}} <b>hives</b> of {{activity}} in science, technology, and innovation are the University of Bahrain (established in 1986) and the Bahrain Centre for Strategic, International, and Energy Studies. The latter was founded in 2009 to undertake research {{with a focus on}} strategic security and energy issues to encourage new thinking and influence policy-making.|$|E
5|$|Beekeepers in Scotland also {{reported}} losses {{for the past}} three years. Andrew Scarlett, a Perthshire-based bee farmer and honey packer, lost 80% of his 1,200 <b>hives</b> during the 2009/10 winter. He attributed the losses to a virulent bacterial infection that quickly spread {{because of a lack of}} bee inspectors, coupled with sustained poor weather that prevented honey bees from building up sufficient pollen and nectar stores.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the USDA {{reported}} that data on overall honey bee losses {{for the year}} indicate an estimated 34% loss, which is statistically similar to losses reported in 2007, 2008, and 2009. In 2011, the loss was 30%. In 2012–2013, CCD was blamed {{for the loss of}} about half of the US honey bee <b>hives,</b> far more than the 33% losses observed on average over previous years.|$|E
50|$|Robbing can be {{prevented}} by reducing the entrances of the <b>hive</b> so the attacked <b>hive</b> {{has a better chance}} of defending itself. Bees are immediately attracted when a <b>hive</b> is opened and honey supers are removed.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} <b>Hive</b> as a novel basis for creating multi-sensor vision systems. <b>Hive</b> is a framework in which reusable modules called drones are defined and connected together to create larger systems. Drones are simple to implement, perform a specific task and using the powerful interface of <b>Hive</b> can be combined to create sophisticated vision pipelines. We present a set of drones defined within <b>Hive</b> and a suite of applications built using these drones which utilize the input from multiple cameras {{and a variety of}} sensors. Results demonstrate the flexibility of approaches possible with <b>Hive</b> as well as the real-time performance of the <b>Hive</b> applications. ...|$|R
50|$|In 2010, a Ladybug {{expansion}} was announced. It {{was presented}} at Essen 2010. The Ladybug moves three spaces; two {{on top of the}} <b>Hive,</b> then one down. It must move exactly two on top of the <b>Hive</b> and then move one down on its last move. It may not move around the outside of the <b>Hive</b> and may not end its movement on top of the <b>Hive.</b> This expansion was released in early 2011, first on electronic versions of the game for iPhone and on the <b>Hive</b> website, then as part of the <b>Hive</b> Carbon edition, and finally as an expansion set for the 3rd edition Bakelite set.|$|R
5|$|Obama's {{predecessors}} Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush {{supported the}} organic movement by instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food, and Obama extended their efforts toward healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady, and installing bee <b>hives,</b> on the South Lawn of the White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.|$|E
5|$|Since U.S. {{beekeeper}} Nephi Miller {{first began}} moving his <b>hives</b> to {{different areas of}} the country for the winter of 1908, migratory beekeeping has become widespread in America. Bee rental for pollination is a crucial element of U.S. agriculture, which could not produce anywhere near its current levels with native pollinators alone. U.S. beekeepers collectively earn much more from renting their bees out for pollination than they do from honey production.|$|E
5|$|Some species {{including}} honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies. Bees are {{adapted for}} feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source {{and the latter}} primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for larvae. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed <b>hives</b> of honey bees.|$|E
