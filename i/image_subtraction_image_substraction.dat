Therefore, an algorithm for PCB defect classification is presented that consists of well-known conventional operations, including <b>image</b> difference, <b>image</b> <b>subtraction,</b> <b>image</b> addition, counted image comparator, flood-fill, and labeling for the classification of six different defects, namely, missing hole, pinhole, underetch, short-circuit, open-circuit, and mousebite.

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{disadvantages}} in manual inspection, {{an automated}} visual inspection system {{is needed to}} eliminate subjective aspects and provides fast and quantitative assessment of printed circuit board (PCB). Up to the present, {{there has been a}} lot of work and research concentrated on PCB defect detection. PCB defects detection is necessary for verification of the characteristics of PCB to make sure it is in conformity with the design specifications. However, besides the need to detect the defects, it is also essential to classify these defects so that the source of these defects can be identified. Unfortunately, this area has been neglected and not been given enough attention. Hence, this study proposes an algorithm to group the defects found on bare PCB. Using a synthetically generated PCB image, the algorithm is able to group 14 commonly known PCB defects into five groups. The proposed algorithm includes several image processing operations such as <b>image</b> <b>subtraction,</b> <b>image</b> adding, logical XOR and NOT, and flood fill operator...|$|R

Therefore, we have developed a new computer-aided temporal and dynamic subtraction technique to enhance small HCCs, after automatically selecting images set at the same anatomical position from the present (non-enhanced and arterial-phase CT images) and previous images. The present study was performed with CT images from 14 subjects. First, we used template-matching based on similarities in liver shape between the present (non-enhanced and arterial-phase CT images) and previous arterial-phase CT images at the same position. Temporal <b>subtraction</b> <b>images</b> were then obtained by <b>subtraction</b> of the previous <b>image</b> from the present image taken at the same position of the liver.

Six dentists were invited to interpret the images projected as slides in random order. Display one demonstrated the slide of the digitized baseline radiograph and the follow-up image. Display two showed the regular digital <b>subtraction</b> <b>image.</b> Display three represented a grey level contrast enhanced version and displays four and five were pseudo/color enhanced <b>subtraction</b> <b>images.</b> Applying kappa-statistics and multiple regression analysis it was demonstrated that better agreements were obtained when the two color coded displays of <b>subtraction</b> <b>images</b> were shown to the interpreters. The image interpretation was performed in two series. For the first evaluation the interpreters were not informed about the therapy provided nor the time elapsed between taking the pairs of standardized radiographs.

It could be demonstrated that the agreement in the diagnosis of bone change was less influenced by the knowledge about the clinical information if the two color-converted versions of subtracted images were evaluated. Thus, it was concluded that <b>image</b> processing of <b>subtraction</b> <b>images</b> using color enhancement might improve agreement in the diagnostic task.

METHODS: FIFTEEN CASES OF LUNG CANCER WITH SERIAL LUNG CT IMAGES (INTERVAL: 62. 2 ± 26. 9 days) were used. After affine transformation, three dimensional, non-linear volume registration was conducted using LDDMM with or without cascading elasticity control. Registration accuracy was evaluated by measuring the displacement of landmarks placed on vessel bifurcations for each lung segment. <b>Subtraction</b> <b>images</b> and Jacobian color maps, calculated from the transformation matrix derived from image warping, were generated, which were used to evaluate time-course changes of the tumors. RESULTS: The average displacement of landmarks was 0. 02 ± 0. 16 mm and 0. 12 ± 0. 60 mm for proximal and distal landmarks after LDDMM transformation with cascading elasticity control, which was significantly smaller than 3. 11 ± 2. 47 mm and 3. 99 ± 3. 05 mm, respectively, after affine transformation.

Two-dimensional HAAR wavelet transform is incorporated in the PCB inspection algorithm of the inspection system. During the inspection, two type of images are required; reference and tested PCB images. The wavelet transform {{is applied to the}} reference and tested PCB images. According to previously proposed wavelet-based PCB inspection algorithm, a reference comparison between the reference and tested PCB images has been done in wavelet domain by employing image difference operation. However, in practice, this operation also bring along the unwanted noise due to misalignment and uneven binarization. Thus, in this paper, for the real-time implementation, the image difference operation between the reference and tested PCB images is replaced with <b>image</b> <b>subtraction.</b> The output of the <b>image</b> <b>subtraction</b> operation can be differentiated as positive, negative, and zero images. By doing so, a noise elimination procedure is applied to positive and negative images, resulting noise free positive and negative images.

During the manufacturing process, since etching usually contributes most destructive defects found on PCBs, it is important to perform the proposed automated visual PCB inspection after the circuit printing and before the etching process.

Intraoral radiographs are indispensably utilized {{both at the}} decision making process for patient treatment plan construction {{as well as in}} postoperative evaluation and follow up visits. Digital radiographic imaging has been introduced as an evolutionary alternative to film-based radiography. Digital subtraction radiography uses two digital images taken under different time points and with specially created computer programs these two images are superimposed upon one another. The resulted <b>image</b> (<b>subtraction</b> <b>image)</b> does not include the common grey scale values and represents / reflects the differences between the initial images. The accuracy of digital subtraction radiography depends on the ability to reproduce the same X-ray projection geometry in serial roentgenograms that are supposed to be subtracted and finally compared. Techniques and holding devices for obtaining serially identical radiographs have been proposed in order to achieve accurate alignment with parallelism between the fixture axis and the film or sensor. Third generation subtraction radiography systems are considered more accurate as they process and adjust different projection geometries so as to produce corrected baseline images before their superimposition and subsequent subtraction. The aim of the present in vitro investigation was to access the accuracy of IRAS/C version 07. 00. 00 Academic edition computer program in creating digital <b>subtraction</b> <b>images</b> between paired intraoral periapical radiographs. Two screw-type implants were inserted in the right buccal segment referring to the sites of the first and the second molars in a human cadaver mandible. An alignment set up system was constructed and used in order to reproduce identical x-ray conditions with the variable of horizontal angulations being intentionally altered. 69 A total of 91 periapical radiographs of the implants were obtained with the first one being the control while the remaining 90 were divided to nine groups of 10 images taken at various horizontal angulation projections. The horizontal angulation differences between the control baseline X-ray and the test group X-rays were set on 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 degrees respectively. All X-rays were digitized and processed using the IRAS/C program. <b>Subtraction</b> <b>images</b> were created by subtracting the control image from the test ones appling a 6 point superimposition set up by the examiner with the correlation value between 0. 9 - 1. There were no statistically significant differences between the control X-ray and the X-rays obtained with 2 - 5 degrees horizontal deviations. On the contrary, X-rays with horizontal variance of 6 - 10 degrees gave statistically significant different images compared to the baseline control image. The {{results of the present study}} demonstrate that serial X-rays taken with different horizontal angulations in central beam while all the other parameters being stable, vary significantly when compared through subtraction and their difference is in accordance to the degree increase. Major prerequisite for intraoral radiographic reproducibility is the application of identical conditions in projection geometry.

METHODS: We included 61 patients (male/female 46 / 15; mean age 60 years) who underwent liver transplantation after LRT with transarterial chemoembolization plus radiofrequency or microwave ablation (n= 56), or (90) Yttrium radioembolization (n= 5). MRI was performed < 90 days before liver transplantation. Three independent readers assessed the following criteria: RECIST, EASL, modified RECIST (mRECIST), percentage of necrosis on <b>subtraction</b> <b>images,</b> and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), both qualitative (signal intensity) and quantitative (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]). The degree of necrosis was retrospectively assessed at histopathology. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cohen's kappa {{were used to assess}} inter-reader agreement. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to determine imaging predictors of CPN. Pearson correlation was performed between imaging criteria and pathologic degree of tumor necrosis. RESULTS: A total of 97 HCCs (mean size 2. 3 ± 1. 3 cm) including 28 with CPN were evaluated. There was excellent inter-reader agreement (ICC 0. 77 - 0. 86, all methods). EASL, mRECIST, percentage of necrosis and qualitative DWI were all significant (p< 0. 001) predictors of CPN, while RECIST and ADC were not. EASL, mRECIST and percentage of necrosis performed similarly (area under the curves [AUCs] 0. 810 - 0. 815) while {{the performance of}} qualitative DWI was lower (AUC 0. 622). <b>Image</b> <b>subtraction</b> demonstrated the strongest correlation (r= 0. 71 - 0. 72, p< 0. 0001) with pathologic degree of tumor necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: EASL/mRECIST criteria and <b>image</b> <b>subtraction</b> have excellent diagnostic performance for predicting CPN in HCC treated with LRT, with <b>image</b> <b>subtraction</b> correlating best with pathologic degree of tumor necrosis. Thus, MR <b>image</b> <b>subtraction</b> is recommended for assessing HCC response to LRT. LAY SUMMARY: The assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor necrosis after locoregional therapy is essential for additional treatment planning and estimation of outcome. In this study, we assessed the performance of various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) response criteria (RECIST, mRECIST, EASL, percentage of necrosis on <b>subtraction</b> <b>images,</b> and diffusion-weighted imaging) for the prediction of complete pathologic necrosis of HCC post locoregional therapy on liver explant. Patients who underwent liver transplantation after locoregional therapy were included in this retrospective study. All patients underwent routine liver MRI within 90 days of liver transplantation. EASL/mRECIST criteria and <b>image</b> <b>subtraction</b> had excellent diagnostic performance for predicting complete pathologic necrosis in treated HCC, with <b>image</b> <b>subtraction</b> correlating best with pathologic degree of tumor necrosis...|$|R
40|$|Motion {{correction}} of 4 D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) series {{is required for}} diagnostic evaluation of liver lesions. The registration, however, is a challenging task, owing to rapid changes in image appearance. In this study, two different registration approaches are compared; a conventional pairwise method applying mutual information as metric and a groupwise method applying a principal component analysis based metric, introduced by Huizinga et al (2016). The pairwise method transforms the individual 3 D images one by one to a reference image, whereas the groupwise registration method computes the metric on all the images simultaneously, exploiting the temporal information, and transforms all 3 D images to a common space. The performance of the two registration methods was evaluated using 70 clinical 4 D DCE-MRI series with {{the focus on the}} liver. The evaluation was based on the smoothness of the time intensity curves in lesions, lesion volume change after deformation and the smoothness of spatial deformation. Furthermore, the visual quality of <b>subtraction</b> <b>images</b> (pre-contrast image subtracted from the post contrast images) before and after registration was rated by two observers. Both registration methods improved the alignment of the DCE-MRI images in comparison to the non-corrected series. Furthermore, the groupwise method achieved better temporal alignment with smoother spatial deformations than the pairwise method. The quality of the <b>subtraction</b> <b>images</b> was graded satisfactory in 32 % of the cases without registration and in 77 % and 80 % of the cases after pairwise and groupwise registration, respectively. In conclusion, the groupwise registration method outperforms the pairwise registration method and achieves clinically satisfying results. Registration leads to improved <b>subtraction</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{demonstrate}} {{the feasibility of}} panoramic <b>image</b> <b>subtraction</b> for implant assessment. STUDY DESIGN: Three titanium implants were inserted into a fresh pig mandible. One intraoral and 2 panoramic images were obtained at baseline and after each of 6 incremental (0. 3, 0. 6, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5 mm) removals of bone. For each incremental removal of bone, the mandible was removed from and replaced in the holding device. Images representing incremental bone removals were registered by computer with the baseline images and subtracted. Assessment of the <b>subtraction</b> <b>images</b> was based on visual inspection and analysis of structured noise. RESULTS: Incremental bone removals were more visible in intraoral than in panoramic subtraction images; however, computer-based registration of panoramic images reduced the structured noise and enhanced the visibility of incremental removals. CONCLUSION: The feasibility of panoramic <b>image</b> <b>subtraction</b> for implant assessment was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|This bachelor’s thesis treats of binary retinal image registration. The {{images were}} photographed with a fundus camera and {{consequently}} a vessel tree has been segmented. Two binary {{images of the}} same retina have been acquired. The aim of this thesis is to acquaint with and describe methods of retinal image segmentation and registration and to suggest a process of binary image registration. The image registration is based on binary vessel tree, which is segmented with an already existing computer programme. One of the images {{is referred to as}} the reference or source and the second image {{is referred to as the}} transformed or sensed. Two image registration methods have been proposed. The first one is based on 2 D transformation and <b>image</b> <b>subtraction.</b> The sensed <b>image</b> is rotated and translated to the position where the vessel tree is overlaid and the images are geometrically aligned. The second method uses detection of blood vessel bifurcation in the binary retinal images...|$|R

40|$|Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) {{has been}} {{successfully}} used for the visualization of the renal and coronary arteries without the need of a contrast agent [1, 2]. The classical approach of ASL consists of the acquisition of two image datasets with and without a spatially selective labeling prepulse. The disadvantages of this methodology include the need for two acquisitions and <b>image</b> <b>subtraction</b> resulting in increased sensitivity to motion. Alternative techniques not requiring <b>image</b> <b>subtraction</b> have been proposed and successfully applied for renal and coronary angiography [3].
