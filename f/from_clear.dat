5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum <b>from</b> <b>clear</b> to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{are white}} to cream on their ventral (belly) surfaces. Their backs and flanks are usually yellowish-green to green, overlain with heavy darker green, but {{occasionally}} brown or black, mottling. The {{effect is a}} marbled appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard's markings. Colouration is related to water clarity; colouration is intense in fish <b>from</b> <b>clear</b> water habitats. Small to medium-sized Murray cod from clear-water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration. Very large fish tend towards a speckled grey-green colouration.|$|E

5|$|This {{record of}} disputed {{succession}} {{was by no}} means unique to Northumbria, and the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex experienced similar troubles during the eighth and ninth centuries. In Wessex, from the death of Centwine in 685 to Egbert's seizure of power in 802, the relationships between successive kings are far <b>from</b> <b>clear</b> and few kings are known to have been close kinsmen of their predecessors or successors. The same may be true of Mercia from the death of Ceolred in 716 until the disappearance of the Mercian kingdom in the late ninth century.|$|E
5|$|After Diocletian's {{reform of}} the provinces, {{governors}} were called iudex, or judge. The governor became responsible for his decisions first to his immediate superiors, {{as well as to}} the more distant office of the emperor. It was most likely at this time that judicial records became verbatim accounts of what was said in trial, making it easier to determine bias or improper conduct on the part of the governor. With these records and the Empire's universal right of appeal, Imperial authorities probably had a great deal of power to enforce behavior standards for their judges. In spite of Diocletian's attempts at reform, the provincial restructuring was far <b>from</b> <b>clear,</b> especially when citizens appealed the decisions of their governors. Proconsuls, for example, were often both judges of first instance and appeal, and the governors of some provinces took appellant cases from their neighbors. It soon became impossible to avoid taking some cases to the emperor for arbitration and judgment. Diocletian's reign marks the end of the classical period of Roman law. Where Diocletian's system of rescripts shows an adherence to classical tradition, Constantine's law is full of Greek and eastern influences.|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} {{responsible for}} the exceptional preservational quality of the Burgess Shale fossils are far <b>from</b> <b>clear.</b> The interpretation of what is preserved depends partly on two issues that are interlinked: whether the animals were buried where they lived, or washed long distances by sediment flows; and whether the water at the burial sites was anoxic or provided enough oxygen to sustain animals. The traditional view is that soft bodies and organs could only be preserved in anoxic conditions, otherwise oxygen-breathing bacteria would have made decomposition too rapid for fossilization. This would imply that the sea-floor organisms could not have lived there. However, in 2006 Caron and Jackson concluded that the sea-floor animals were buried where they lived. One of their main reasons was that many fossils represented partially decayed soft-bodied animals such as polychaetes, which had already died shortly before the burial event, {{and would have been}} fragmented if they had been transported any significant distance by a storm of swirling sediment. Other evidence for burial where the animals had lived includes the presence of tubes and burrows, and of assemblies of animals preserved while they fed – such as a group of carnivorous priapulids clustered round a freshly moulted arthropod whose new cuticle would not yet have hardened. Fossilized swimming organisms were also buried immediately below where they lived.|$|E

25|$|In North American lakes, piscivorous {{fish can}} {{dramatically}} reduce populations of zooplanktivorous fish, zooplanktivorous fish can dramatically alter freshwater zooplankton communities, and zooplankton grazing can in turn have large impacts on phytoplankton communities. Removal of piscivorous fish can change lake water <b>from</b> <b>clear</b> to green by allowing phytoplankton to flourish.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} Christian century Manichaeism spread both {{east and west}} from Babylonia, then within the Sassanid Empire, where its founder Mani lived about 216–276. Manichaean monasteries existed in Rome in 312 AD. Noting Mani's early travels to the Kushan Empire and other Buddhist {{influences}} in Manichaeism, Richard Foltz attributes Mani's teaching of reincarnation to Buddhist influence. However the inter-relation of Manicheanism, Orphism, Gnosticism and neo-Platonism is far <b>from</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E

25|$|As part of {{a series}} of major {{infrastructure}} projects in the 1990s under Mahathir Mohamad's government, the Sepang International Circuit was constructed between 1997 and 1999 close to Putrajaya, the then-newly founded administrative capital of the country, with the intent of hosting the Malaysian Grand Prix. Similar to other of the country's circuits, the circuit is known for its unpredictable humid tropical weather, varying <b>from</b> <b>clear</b> furnace hot days to tropical rain storms.|$|E

25|$|After {{establishing}} {{a connection to}} Clear Lake, the Russian River was beheaded <b>from</b> <b>Clear</b> Lake by a slide (at Cow Mountain, east of Ukiah). Now Clear Lake flows into the Sacramento River. The river incised a canyon into Fitch Mountain at an early time, before land levels were eroded to their present levels. The Russian River was prevented from flowing south into San Pablo Bay, due to a 113-foot high ridge at Cotati. Guerneville is built on an abandoned meander of the river. Near Guerneville, another meander cut short Smith Creek.|$|E

25|$|We have a {{detailed}} account for the lead up to the battle from the Roman perspective from Ammianus Marcellinus, which forms the culminating point {{at the end of}} his history. The position in his histories and the lack of {{a detailed}} history for the following century has tended to exaggerate the significance of the battle for later historians. Ammianus's account of the battle itself, as to be expected from a losing side, is far <b>from</b> <b>clear.</b> Heat, fire and dust seem to have been particularly significant. Much of what follows about the battle itself is modern supposition.|$|E
25|$|Events in Europe and North America were {{unfolding}} quickly {{during this}} period. The future was far <b>from</b> <b>clear.</b> The MS St. Louis crisis {{did not occur}} until June 1939. War did not break out until September 1939, and Stanley served in the Canadian military during World War II, a cause {{to which he was}} profoundly committed. One of his responsibilities was supervising the Canadian War Artists, who revealed the true horrors of the war, including those of the concentration camps, to the world. Furthermore, in his later life, Stanley’s circle included highly esteemed Jewish friends whose interests ranged from business to the arts.|$|E
25|$|The role of OSM as an {{inflammatory}} mediator was clear {{as early as}} 1986. Its precise effect on the immune system, as with any cytokine, is far <b>from</b> <b>clear.</b> However, two schools of thought are emerging: The first proposes that OSM is pro-inflammatory; whilst the other holds the opposite view, claiming OSM is anti-inflammatory. It {{is important to note}} that before 1997 differences in human and murine OSM receptor usage were unknown. As a result, several investigators utilised human OSM in mouse assays and thus any conclusion drawn from the results of these experiments will be representative of LIF, i.e. signalling through gp130/LIFR complexes.|$|E

25|$|Murray and Allenby {{were invited}} to give lectures at Aldershot in 1931 about the Palestine Campaign. Exchanging letters beforehand, Murray asked whether it had been worth risking the Western Front to {{transfer}} troops to Palestine. Allenby avoided that question, but commented {{that it had been}} far <b>from</b> <b>clear</b> that the Allies were going to win the war in 1917 and into the spring of 1918. Russia had dropped out, but the Americans were not yet present in strength. France and Italy were weakened and might have been persuaded to make peace, perhaps by Germany giving up Belgium, Alsace-Lorraine, and the Trentino. In those circumstances, Germany was likely to be left in control of Eastern Europe and the Balkans, and it had been sensible for Britain to grab some land in the Middle East to block Germany's route to India. Allenby's views mirrored those of the War Cabinet at the time.|$|E
25|$|In May 2002, the Guardian Media Group made a bid of £41 {{million to}} Jazz FM plc at 180p a share. The bid {{came on the}} day when the draft Communication Bill was {{published}} Jazz FM plc's largest shareholder, Clear Channel had been waiting for a 220p a share bid, but agreed to the 180p a share bid in late May. Herald Investment Management who had a 7.7% stake in the company and Aberforth Partners were not happy with the 180p a share bid. On 6 June, GMG raised its bid to 195p a share to secure the institutional shareholders who were holding out for a better bid. Richard Wheatly announced that he would leave Jazz FM once the takeover was complete. The offer was declared wholly unconditional on 5 July. In December 2002, GMG moved its sales operation <b>from</b> <b>Clear</b> Channel Radio Sales to the Chrysalis Group, inline with the sales operation for other GMG Radio stations.|$|E
