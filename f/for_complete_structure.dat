40|$|Recent {{developments}} in analytical technologies have driven significant advances in lipid science. The sensitivity and selectivity of modern mass spectrometers can now {{provide for the}} detection and even quantification of many hundreds of lipids in a single analysis. In parallel, increasing evidence from structural biology suggests that a detailed knowledge of lipid molecular structure including carbon-carbon double bond position, stereochemistry and acyl chain regiochemistry is required to fully appreciate the biochemical role(s) of individual lipids. Here we review the capabilities and limitations of tandem mass spectrometry to provide this level of structural specificity {{in the analysis of}} lipids present in complex biological extracts. In particular, we focus on the capabilities of a novel technology termed ozone-induced dissociation to identify the position (s) of double bonds in unsaturated lipids and discuss its possible role in efforts to develop workflows that provide <b>for</b> <b>complete</b> <b>structure</b> elucidation of lipids by mass spectrometry alone: so-called top-down lipidomics.

40|$|The {{presence}} of transition metals {{in the main}} chain of synthetic polymers can give rise to unique properties which {{differ from those of}} organic polymers. Recently, our group developed a route to strained ferrocenophanes (FCPs) with planar chirality. Through ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of these chiral monomers, new metallopolymers with potentially interesting properties could be obtained. In addition, the chirality of [1]FCPs provided some insight into the mechanism of a ROP process. Following known “Ugi’s amine” chemistry, new dibromoferrocene derivatives with planar-chirality were prepared. The synthesis and characterization of two families of dibromoferrocene derivatives with C 2 and C 1 symmetry, respectively, are described. Dibromoferrocene derivatives (Sp,Sp) - 1, 1 '-dibromo- 2, 2 '-di(3 -pentyl) ferrocene [(Sp,Sp) - 107] and (R,R,Sp,Sp) - 1, 1 '-dibromo- 2, 2 '-di(2 -butyl) ferrocene [(R,R,Sp,Sp) - 108] with C 2 symmetry were prepared and fully characterized. The molecular structure of (Sp,Sp) - 107 was determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis. The synthesis and characterization of 1, 1 '-dibromo- 2 -isopropylferrocene (109) with C 1 symmetry is reported in racemic (rac- 109) as well as in enantiomerically pure form [(Sp) - 109]. Salt-metathesis reactions of the dilithio derivative of (Sp,Sp) - 107 with ArʹGaCl 2 [Arʹ = 2 -(Me 2 NCH 2) C 6 H 4] and Me 2 SiCl 2 afforded novel gallium- and silicon-bridged [1]FCPs (Sp,Sp) - 124 and (Sp,Sp) - 125, respectively. Salt-metathesis reaction of the dilithio derivative of rac- 109 and (Sp) - 109 with Me 2 SiCl 2 affords novel silicon-bridged [1]FCPs in both racemic and enantiomerically pure forms [rac- 126 and (Sp) - 126]. The molecular structure of rac- 126 was determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Salt-metathesis reaction of the dilithio derivative of (Sp,Sp) - 107 with tBuPCl 2 yielded new phosphorus-bridged [1]FCPs (127). Compound 127 with C 1 symmetry [(Sp,Sp) - 127 C 1] isomerized in reaction mixture to give the Cs-symmetrical phosphorus-bridged [1]FCP meso- 127 Cs. The molecular structure of meso- 127 Cs was determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis. DFT calculations were performed to study the structure and understand the extra strain in (Sp,Sp) - 127 C 1. The salt-metathesis reaction of the dilithio derivative of rac- 109 and PhPCl 2 afforded a mixture of cis and trans isomers of a phosphorus-bridged [1]FCP (rac- 130), each present as a racemate. Experimental and theoretical data for the interconversion of cis and trans diastereomers of rac- 130, which occurs through inversion at phosphorus, is reported. The molecular structure of the cis isomer rac- 130 cis was determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermographs of rac- 126, (Sp) - 126, and rac- 130 suggest that these are potential candidates for thermal ROP. Compounds rac- 126 and (Sp) - 126 were polymerized via thermal ROP and afforded polymers 132 and 133, respectively. The resulting polymers were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen (CHN) elemental analysis. The high molecular weight and low polydispersity index (PDI) were determined by triple-detection GPC analysis for polymers 132 and 133. The thermal ROP of silicon-bridged [1]FCP with iPr groups on both Cp rings resulted in polymer 134 which due to solubility issues could not be fully characterized. Thermal ROP of rac- 130 was performed and the resulting products were sulfurized for characterization. This ROP afforded both linear polymer (135) and several cyclic phosphines as side products. Polymer 136 was analyzed by GPC, NMR spectroscopy, and CHN analysis. Mass spectra of this mixture revealed the {{presence of}} cyclic phosphines from dimers to heptamers. Preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC) was carried out in order to separate this mixture.

Using the Enzyme Commission and the Gene Ontology classifications as a reference frame, and integrating structure data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), target sequences from the structural genomics projects, structure homology derived from the SUPERFAMILY database, and genome annotations from Ensembl and NCBI, we provide a quantified view, both at the domain and whole-protein levels, of the current and projected coverage of protein {{structure and function}} space relative to the human genome.
