50|$|A {{special class}} of {{closed-cell}} foams, known as syntactic foam, contains hollow particles {{embedded in a}} matrix material.

The advantage of syntactic foams is that they have a very high strength-to-weight ratio, making them ideal materials for many applications, including deep-sea and space applications. One particular syntactic foam employs shape memory polymer as its matrix, enabling the foam to take on the characteristics of shape memory resins and composite materials; i.e., it has the ability to be reshaped repeatedly when heated above a certain temperature and cooled. Shape memory foams have many possible applications, such as dynamic structural support, <b>flexible</b> <b>foam</b> core, and expandable foam fill.|$|E
