Olga and her siblings, however, were not accustomed to a lavish early lifestyle. Conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursery</b> were modest, even Spartan.

5|$|Males, {{females and}} juveniles each form {{separate}} social groups. The male groups are the smallest; the members stay together {{and search for}} food or water sources. The female group is much larger and covers greater areas. They travel the grassy plains in wet periods and prefer bushy areas in dry periods. Females have a complex linear hierarchy. The nursery and juvenile group is naturally formed when females give birth to calves. After about 24 hours of the delivery, the mother and calf join this group. The calves start befriending each other and stay back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursery</b> group while the mother returns to the female group. The calves leave the nursery group when they {{are at least two}} years old and join a male or female group.|$|E
5|$|When {{they arise}} in the spring, the females go to nursery colonies which may often be the same place where they were born. These nursery colonies consist mainly of adult females and their young and can {{be located in the}} attics of warm {{buildings}} where there is high humidity. These colonies sometimes reach numbers of bats as great as 1,000 per cave/forest. Gestation lasts 50–60 days. They usually have one baby per female each year, sometimes twins, born sometime from late May to early July. The young are born in an altricial state with their eyes closed and will hang <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursery</b> while their mothers forage at night. Their eyes open on their second day. They cling to a nipple constantly until they are two weeks old. At three weeks, they learn to fly. By four weeks, they are adult sized. Females may be sexually mature in the fall after their birth, but males may take a year longer. About half of females and most males breed during their first autumn.|$|E
40|$|The {{bays and}} {{estuaries}} {{of the southeast}} United States coast generally are thought to serve as nursery areas for various species of coastal sharks, where juvenile sharks find abundant food and are less exposed to predation by larger sharks.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to demonstrate an effect of manual feeding on the level of farmer’s exposure to airborne contaminants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> confinement <b>nursery</b> pig house. <b>The</b> levels of all the airborne contaminants besides respirable dust, total airborne fungi and ammonia were significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treated <b>nursery</b> pig house with feeding than <b>the</b> control <b>nursery</b> pig house without feeding. Although there is no significant difference in respirable dust and total airborne fungi between the treatment and the control, their concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treated <b>nursery</b> pig house were also higher than <b>the</b> control <b>nursery</b> pig house. <b>The</b> result that the level of ammonia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treated <b>nursery</b> pig house is lower than <b>the</b> control <b>nursery</b> pig house would be reasoned by the mechanism of ammonia generation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pig house and adsorption property of ammonia to dust particles. In conclusion, manual feeding by farmer increased the exposure level of airborne contaminants compared to no feeding activity...|$|R

40|$|Based on archival {{material}} and relevant literature, this article traces {{the history of}} <b>the</b> Čibača Plant <b>Nursery</b> from its establishment in 1911 to 1932, when it was closed down. The initial purpose of setting up a nursery in Čibača, 7 km east of Dubrovnik, was to combat the spreading of grape vine disease in southern Dalmatia by producing American vine rootstocks. <b>The</b> <b>Nursery’s</b> original activity later also included the cultivation of Mediterranean plants—olives, figs, carob beans, oranges, lemons, ornamental plants and aromatic herbs. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> <b>Nursery</b> promoted other agricultural activities, such as apiculture and sericulture, {{as well as the}} growth of tansy. From 1927 onwards, <b>the</b> <b>Nursery</b> organised agrarian courses which, unfortunately, the people ge-nerally attended only to fulfil <b>the</b> necessary qualifications <b>in</b> order to obtain the USA immigration visa. Following the initial success during Austrian rule, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interwar Yugosla-via <b>the</b> <b>Nursery</b> stagnated due mainly to unprofessional management and poor financial support. A disease caused by Bacterium tumefaciens, coupled by political intereference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nursery’s</b> operation resulted <b>in</b> 1932 in its closing down, the activities being relocated to Toplica near Bar <b>in</b> Montenegro.

40|$|Indicators {{of growth}} and {{condition}} were {{used to compare the}} habitat quality of nurseries of juvenile sole (Solea solea L.) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bay of Biscay, based on one survey <b>in</b> 2000. <b>The</b> four biological indicators are poorly correlated with each other, suggesting that no single measure may give an adequate description of fish health and of its habitat’s quality. Growth indicators showed significant differences between northern and southern areas. Juveniles from <b>the</b> two southernmost <b>nurseries,</b> <b>the</b> Gironde estuary and the Pertuis Antioche, displayed significant lower otolith increment widths and mean sizes. These differences were inversely related to water temperature and unrelated to genetic or age differences, and are unlikely to be due to limiting trophic conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nurseries.</b> Hence, they may be considered in terms of differences in habitat quality and potential anthropogenic impacts. Condition indices do not show this north-south pattern but highlight low condition values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pertuis Antioche.
