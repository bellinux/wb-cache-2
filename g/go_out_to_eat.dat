50|$|In game theory, the unscrupulous diner's dilemma (or just diner's dilemma) is an n-player prisoner's dilemma. The {{situation}} imagined is {{that several}} individuals <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> and prior to ordering, {{they agree to}} split the check equally between all of them.

It is presupposed that the expensive dish {{is better than the}} cheaper, but not by enough to warrant paying the difference when eating alone. Each individual reasons that the expense s/he adds to their bill by ordering the more expensive item is very small, and thus the improved dining experience is worth the money. However, having all reasoned thus, they all end up paying for the cost of the more expensive meal, which by assumption, is worse for everyone than having ordered and paid for the cheaper meal.|$|E

5000|$|Ardilla {{died in a}} car {{accident}} in Bandung at approximately 05:30 on 19 March 1995. The night before the accident, she met with friends from Aneka-Yess!, a popular teenage magazine, at Jayakarta Hotel Bandung, to discuss the election of the magazine's cover girl and cover boy. The election was to be held the following day, with Ardilla appearing as a guest star at the event. At 00:30, she and her manager Sofiatun left the meeting and went to Pollo Club, a night club in Jl. Asia Afrika, to meet other friends. They <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> at a restaurant at 03:30, and at 04:30, Ardilla accompanied a friend to her hotel. She and Sofiatun left the hotel at 05:15 to go home. Ardilla was driving her Honda Civic Genio D 27 AK, which had been known to seem unstable at times. After overtaking another car, she lost control and hit the fence of the wall in Jl. R. E. Martadinata, Bandung. The accident had likely been caused by a manufacturer defect in the Vehicle Stability Assist (“VSA”) system of the Class Vehicles that causes the Class Vehicles’ brakes to suddenly engage without warning (“Autonomous Braking Defect”). There had been many cases reported in the United Kingdom and Europe whereby the steering became locked. Ardilla died instantly from blunt force trauma to the head. She was nineteen years old.
