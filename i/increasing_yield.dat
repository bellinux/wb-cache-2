25|$|The {{character}} of the radiation received at a given location also varies with distance from the explosion. Near {{the point of the}} explosion, the neutron intensity is greater than the gamma intensity, but with increasing distance the neutron-gamma ratio decreases. Ultimately, the neutron component of initial radiation becomes negligible in comparison with the gamma component. The range for significant levels of initial radiation does not increase markedly with weapon yield and, as a result, the initial radiation becomes less of a hazard with <b>increasing</b> <b>yield.</b> With larger weapons, above 50 kt (200 TJ), blast and thermal effects are so much greater in importance that prompt radiation effects can be ignored.|$|E
25|$|Another {{explanation}} is that longer maturities entail greater risks for the investor (i.e. the lender). A risk premium is needed by the market, since at longer durations there is more uncertainty and a greater chance of catastrophic events that impact the investment. This explanation depends {{on the notion that}} the economy faces more uncertainties in the distant future than in the near term. This effect {{is referred to as the}} liquidity spread. If the market expects more volatility in the future, even if interest rates are anticipated to decline, the increase in the risk premium can influence the spread and cause an <b>increasing</b> <b>yield.</b>|$|E
25|$|Beet curly top virus (BCTV) {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1888 in the Western {{parts of the}} United States. The virus wasn’t fully recognized until 1907 when people started {{to realize that the}} virus was affecting their crops which led to <b>increasing</b> <b>yield</b> loss. As the BCTV began to surface and multiply within the United States, it affected many states (California, Idaho, Utah, and Washington) located in the Western area.

The BCTV has also been known to affect other countries including Mexico, South America, and the Old World (the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East).|$|E
