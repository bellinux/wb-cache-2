5|$|Given the {{literary}} and theatrical {{activities of the}} Round Table members, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> inevitable that they would write and stage their own revue. No Sirree!, staged for one night only in April 1922, was a take-off of a then-popular European touring revue called La Chauve-Souris, directed by Nikita Balieff.|$|E
5|$|India ink: Although {{named after}} {{carbonaceous}} pigment materials originating from India, Indian ink {{first appeared in}} China; some scholars say it was made {{as far back as}} the 3rd millennium BC, while others state <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> not invented until the Wei Dynasty (220–265 AD).|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} these {{personal}} modifications mostly went unrecorded. It is believed he achieved a height of 10,000 feet in nine minutes, curtailing the standard time by some five minutes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> on exaggeration but no record remains to certify what McCudden did. He did note the maximum ground-level speed as 135mph in his log book. He achieved these feats with the limited resources of a front-line squadron and without any official assistance.|$|E

5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
5|$|During his {{apprenticeship}} {{and early}} career Wright concentrated on portraiture. By 1762, {{he was an}} accomplished portrait artist, and his 1764 group portrait James Shuttleworth, his Wife and Daughter is acknowledged as his first true masterpiece. Benedict Nicolson suggests that Wright {{was influenced by the}} work of Thomas Frye; in particular by the 18 bust-length mezzotints which Frye completed just before his death in 1762. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> Frye's candlelight images that tempted Wright to experiment with subject pieces. Wright's first attempt, A Girl reading a Letter by candlelight with a Young Man looking over her shoulder from 1762 or 1763, is a trial in the genre, and is fetching though uncomplicated.|$|E
5|$|The news of Raj's {{possible}} arrest {{provoked a}} heightened {{attack on the}} North Indians in the industrial town of Nashik in Maharashtra, Raj's political stronghold. North Indians left the city by buses, trains and private vehicles. Railway officials at Nashik station {{said that this was}} the largest crowd using the railroad since the Sinhasta Kumbha Mela in 2003–2004. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> one of the largest exoduses from a single district in the country ever. Chhagan Bhujbal, Nashik's guardian minister, reported that 15,000migrant workers had left the city {{in the aftermath of the}} violence against North Indians.|$|E

5|$|Gloucester was {{involved}} in a brief skirmish with the Scots on 23June, the day before the main battle. While the king considered whether to camp for the night or to engage the Scots immediately, Gloucester and Hereford – either through insubordination or a misunderstanding – charged directly into the place called the New Park, where the Scots were encamped. The English immediately ran into difficulties, and Hereford's cousin Henry de Bohun was killed by King Robert the Bruce. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> during the subsequent retreat that Gloucester was thrown off his horse, but managed to escape unharmed. The next day the English were still not entirely decided on the course of action. While Gloucester took the part of certain experienced captains, recommending that Edward avoid battle that day, the younger men surrounding the king labelled this lethargic and cowardly, and advised attack. According to the Vita Edwardi, when Edward grew angry and accused Gloucester of treason, the earl forcefully replied that he would prove his loyalty on the field of battle.|$|E

25|$|The second {{possibility}} is High Sunderland Hall, near Halifax, now demolished. This Gothic edifice was located near Law Hill, where Emily worked briefly as a governess in 1838. While <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> grander than Wuthering Heights, the hall had grotesque embellishments of griffins and misshapen nude males {{similar to those}} described by Lockwood in Chapter 1 of the novel.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> to emphasise the new civic {{serenity}} of Subotica {{that the}} pious name Saint Mary {{came to be}} used for it at this time. Some decades later, in 1779, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria advanced the town's status further by proclaiming it a Free Royal Town. The enthusiastic inhabitants of the city renamed Subotica once more as Maria-Theresiopolis.|$|E
25|$|The Arsenal's main gate, the Porta Magna, {{was built}} around 1460 {{and was the}} first Classical revival {{structure}} built in Venice. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> built by Antonio Gambello from a design by Jacopo Bellini. Two lions taken from Greece situated beside it were added in 1687. One of the lions, known as the Piraeus Lion, has runic defacements carved in it by invading Scandinavian mercenaries during the 11th century.|$|E
25|$|Dodge {{created a}} highly {{effective}} intelligence gathering network which later proved vital to Grant's operations {{and was a}} precursor to the modern Intelligence Corps of the United States Army. It {{was one of the}} largest of the war, funded by the proceeds of capture Confederate cotton, with over 100 agents, and so effective that their identities remain a mystery even in modern times. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> the most accurate and comprehensive intelligence gathering network in history up to that time.|$|E

25|$|It {{might have}} been well if Nubar had {{confined}} himself to this modest programme, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> hardly to be expected of {{a man of his}} ability and restless energy. It must be admitted, however, that the characters of Nubar and Lord Cromer were not formed to run in harness, and it was with no surprise that the public learnt in June 1888 that he had been relieved of office, though his dismissal was the direct act of the khedive Tawfiq, who did not on this occasion seek the advice of the British agent.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{granted to}} Lambros Katsonis {{and later a}} {{possession}} of the Potocki family, the Livadia estate became a summer residence of the Russian imperial family in the 1860s, when architect Ippolito Monighetti built a large palace, a small palace, and a church there. The residence was frequented by Alexander II of Russia, while his successor Alexander III used to live (and died) in the smaller palace. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> disagreeable associations with the latter circumstance that led his son Nicholas to have both palaces demolished and replaced with a larger structure.|$|E
25|$|While Prinz Eugen was refuelled, Lütjens {{declined}} {{to top up}} the Bismarck. A rupture {{in one of the}} fuel lines had allowed only an initial influx of 6,000 tons. A further 2,000 tons was to be accepted at sea. The ship had left the Baltic 200 tons short, and had since burned 1,000 tons reaching Norway. Lütjens knew that the German tanker Weissenberg was waiting for him in the Arctic, only an additional day's sailing away, but farther from prying British eyes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> his intention to replenish there. In the event he did not refuel during the operation.|$|E

25|$|The legend {{may result}} {{from the fact that}} the daddy long-legs spider preys upon deadly venomous spiders, such as the redback, a member of the black widow genus Latrodectus. To the extent that such entomological {{information}} was known to the general public, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> thought that if the daddy long-legs spider could kill a spider capable of delivering fatal bites to humans, then it must be more venomous, and the uncate fangs were regarded as prohibiting it from killing people. In reality, it is able to cast lengths of silk onto its prey, incapacitating them from a safe distance.|$|E
25|$|St Robert's Church, Pannal, North Yorkshire, England, {{also known}} as St Robert of Knaresborough Parish Church, is a Grade II* listed building. A 13th-century wooden church {{dedicated}} to St Michael was rebuilt in sandstone in the 14thcentury by monks of the Trinitarian Order from Knaresborough Priory. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> then that it was rededicated to Robert of Knaresborough. Its nave was rebuilt in the 18thcentury, restored in the 19th and remodelled in the 20th. Extensions were added in the 20thcentury. It is a parish church, and the vicar also serves the Church of St Michael and All Angels, Beckwithshaw.|$|E
25|$|Fallmerayer's anti-Russian sentiments {{were not}} yet fully developed, and upon his return to Munich in 1842, he was befriended by the Russian poet and diplomat Fyodor Tyutchev. This latter had been {{entrusted}} by Karl Nesselrode and Alexander von Benckendorff {{to find a new}} spokesperson for Russian interests in Germany. Fallmerayer's Greek thesis had aroused interest in Russian circles, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> for this reason that Tyutchev approached Fallmerayer and proposed that he should serve as a journalistic mouthpiece for Czarist policy. Fallmerayer declined, and it has indeed been suggested that his growing opposition to Russian expansionism was provoked by this encounter.|$|E
