The connections between interlocking panels are vitally crucial since they affect both performance and homogenous of structure. The depletion of natural aggregate sources and increase amount of waste concrete from construction promote the application of crushed concrete waste aggregate (CCwA) in structure. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the bending strength capacity and mode of failure in reinforced concrete interlocking <b>joint</b> <b>panels</b> by using crushed concrete waste aggregate (CCwA). Two (2) set of interlocking panels with dimension of 75 mm x 900 mm x 500 mm (thickness, length and height) were subjected to three point load at the connection located in the midspan of panels. In comparison, the results shows that the interlocking <b>joint</b> <b>panels</b> with CCwA are passing the entire requirement in specified MS and BS. This is showing that interlocking panels with CCwA can be an alternative in replacing the natural aggregates. The study shows that the interlocking panels using CCwA under three loading points are good enough to be used in industry. This will promote application of interlocking panel in construction and give out a solution on the wastage of construction material and shortage in natural aggregate...|$|R

To identify factors limiting individual-level Aboriginal participation in this environmental assessment, a program evaluation of the <b>Joint</b> Review <b>Panel’s</b> public participation initiatives and {{a study of the}} impacts of five contextual factors were conducted. The results of this study reveal four key process deficiencies which may have contributed to limited individual-level Aboriginal public participation in the <b>Joint</b> Review <b>Panel</b> proceedings; namely, deficiencies in respect of cultural compatibility, resource accessibility, point of involvement, and process clarity. This research also indicates that the over-lapping factors of socio-economic status, social relationships, consultation fatigue, Euro-Canadian colonialism, and relevance may have further constrained Aboriginal public participation in this environmental assessment. Recommendations for improving individual-level Aboriginal participation in northern environmental assessment processes are formulated based upon these research results...|$|R

50|$|The witness phase {{took three}} weeks, {{during which the}} United Kingdom called seven witnesses, while Albania called three. Witness and expert {{examinations}} generally followed the common law system, with direct examination, cross-examination and redirect examination. This phase of the proceedings was also characterized by flexibility {{on the part of}} the Court, with a view to the novelty of the entire situation. On one occasion, the Court allowed recross examination. The Court itself asked questions of some witnesses, almost always between the conclusion of cross-examination and the beginning of redirect examination. On one occasion, the ad hoc judge asked a question of an expert witness between direct and cross-examination; the Court and the parties agreed that the question would instead be submitted in written form to the <b>joint</b> <b>panel</b> of experts. Examinations were primarily conducted in English and French, with interpreters where necessary. During the Albanian cross-examination of Kovacic, the Court had to rule on an objection regarding whether a photostatic copy of a document was admissible as evidence. The Court ruled that the original document needed to be produced, though it confined its ruling to the individual document. A subsequent evidentiary dispute was similarly resolved solely with respect to the disputed documents, without having an effect on precedence. The examination phase was comparatively long, requiring twenty sittings of the Court, compared to fifteen sittings for the two rounds of pleadings.|$|E

[...] "We had proposed to mediate in setting up a <b>joint</b> <b>panel</b> which would appoint financial advisors to conduct due diligence so that a new debt restructuring plan could be proposed," [...] said Kitti Limsakul, an advisor to Thailand's finance minister, before the June 13 ruling. [...] "But we respect {{the right of the}} creditors." [...] Kitti said the government would not act unless directed by the court. In what would be a clear sign of things to come, the court had already signalled its approval of a government role in the crisis. Judge Kamol Teeravetponkul of the Central Bankruptcy Court on 21 May 2003 said that the businesses run by TPI were too big to be nursed back to health by the private sector. [...] "The appointment of a tripartite debt administration team as suggested by the government is good solution," [...] Reuters News Agency quoted Kamol as saying.
