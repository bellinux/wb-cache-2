It is important to consider the direction of tidal streams as well as their strength to avoid divers being swept into dangerous areas such as shipping lanes or areas known to have <b>entanglement</b> <b>hazards.</b> It is also important to plan for the possibility of separation, either underwater or at the surface.|$|E
50|$|MS Mikhail Lermontov rests {{where it}} sank, lying on its {{starboard}} side in depths reaching up {{to a maximum}} of about 38 m. It is popular with Scuba divers and the site is served by local dive shops in Picton and Kaikoura. It {{is also one of the}} biggest, easily accessible, diveable ship wrecks in the world. The dives range from an easy 12m depth at the top of the wreck, through to deep penetration and decompression dives to depths of 36m.It is possible to enter the wreck, especially in the open public areas accessible from the port side windows near the top of the wreck, although care must be taken and guides familiar with the wreck are highly recommended, especially for enclosed overhead environments and where <b>entanglement</b> <b>hazards</b> may exist. Closed circuit diving is recommended to avoid causing reduced visibility when entering enclosed areas such as restaurants, crew messes, and shopping arcades. Three divers are known to have died while exploring the ship, including one diver whose body is still possibly trapped inside.|$|E

50|$|Anthony Andrady {{says that}} {{releases}} of latex balloons that descend {{into the sea}} pose a serious ingestion and/or <b>entanglement</b> <b>hazard</b> to marine animals because balloons exposed floating in seawater deteriorate much more slowly than those exposed in air. Balloon manufacturers will often state that a latex balloon is perfectly safe to release into the environment as it is made from a natural substance and will biodegrade over time. However, a latex balloon {{can take up to}} a year to degrade if it lands in the sea and during this time it is possible for a marine animal to ingest the balloon and die from slow starvation if its digestive system is blocked.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually, Thunderbolt was {{donated to}} the Florida Keys Artificial Reef Association, and the vessel was scuttled 4 nmi km south of Marathon, Florida and Key Colony Beach, Florida on 6 March 1986. [...] The wreck sits on a flat sandy bottom 120 ft {{below the surface of}} the water, nearly {{completely}} intact. The condition of the wreck and the abundance of marine life in and around the wreck make it an excellent dive site. The main superstructure was cleared of most <b>entanglement</b> <b>hazard</b> prior to sinking, so she provides ample opportunity for penetration. Her lower decks are largely clear of debris, although they can be very silty, and the many openings and exits in the deck provide easy entry and exit points.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Nearly all tractor PTO {{arrangements}} {{used today}} {{consist of a}} rotating mechanical shaft with two or more universal joints and splined couplings. Although this method of power transfer has been the standard for decades, {{it continues to be}} a hazard to farm workers. Commonly, PTO accidents involve the snagging of clothes, resulting in the victim being rapidly and violently drawn into (and around) the rotating shaft. Entanglement injuries are both common and severe in the agricultural workforce, with poor shielding maintenance as a contributing factor. If PTO loads were driven with fluid power, this <b>entanglement</b> <b>hazard</b> would be eliminated. With high–pressure injection injury being the principal hazard, the fluid power alternative appears to pose a lower risk in terms of both frequency of occurrence and severity of injury...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Nearly all tractor PTO {{arrangements}} {{used today}} {{consist of a}} rotating mechanical shaft with two or more universal joints. This arrangement {{continues to be an}} <b>entanglement</b> <b>hazard.</b> By driving the attachment with fluid power, this hazard could be eliminated. This project included the design, development, and testing of an experimental tractor based on a John Deere 4040. The entire power train was treated as a single computer-controlled system where both the PTO output and the wheels were driven by fluid power. To support direct laboratory and in-field comparison of hydraulic and mechanical scenarios, the original transmissions were left intact and functional. Results showed that at low power demand, the hydraulic system was more efficient than the mechanical equivalent; however, the mechanical version was more efficient over most of the load range and was capable of higher power output. The use of computer control helped to minimize fuel consumption by matching engine speed to loading conditions while maintaining operating speeds by varying hydraulic pump displacement. The hydraulic PTO system for the JD 4040 has the potential to match or increase fuel efficiency compared to its mechanical counterpart for loads up to about 40 % of rated mechanical PTO output. Maximum power output in the hydraulic mode {{has the potential to be}} 75 % of that achieved by the mechanical equivalent...|$|R
40|$|The task of {{installing}} and servicing high energy neutrino detectors {{in the deep}} ocean from a surface support vessel is problematic using conventional tethered systems. An array of multiple detector strings rising 500 m from the ocean floor, and forming a grid with 50 m spacing between the strings, presents a substantial <b>entanglement</b> <b>hazard</b> for equipment cables deployed from the surface. Such tasks may be accomplished with fewer risks using a tetherless underwater remotely operated vehicle that has a local acoustic telemetry link to send control commands and sensor data between the vehicle and a stationary hydrophone suspended above or just outside {{the perimeter of the}} work site. The Phase I effort involves the development of an underwater acoustic telemetry link for vehicle control and sensor feedback, the evaluation of video compression methods for real-time acoustic transmission of video through the water, and the defining of local control routines on board the vehicle to allow it to perform certain basic maneuvering tasks autonomously, or to initiate a self-rescue if the acoustic control link should be lost. In Phase II, a prototype tetherless vehicle system will be designed and constructed to demonstrate the ability to install cable interconnections within a detector array at 4 km depth. The same control technology could be used with a larger more powerful vehicle to maneuver the detector strings into desired positions as they are being lowered to the ocean floor...|$|R
50|$|Streamlining and {{maintaining}} a low profile and cross sectional area are important considerations but effectiveness and robust applicability {{to a wide range}} of environments are possibly more important, as they allow a basic core configuration that is effective in virtually any recreational diving situation, and allow standardisation of procedures, which in turn lets the diving team be assembled from similarly trained and equipped divers, who integrate more easily into an effective team. In this context, streamlining includes the aspect of reducing hydrodynamic drag when swimming, but more importantly, the reduction of <b>entanglement</b> and entrapment <b>hazards</b> due to equipment components to a minimum.|$|R
40|$|Personal {{floatation}} devices (PFDs) {{save lives}} in the fishing industry. Most work-related fatalities in the fishing industry are caused by drowning after a vessel disaster or a fall overboard. Although the risk of drowning is high, most deckhands do not wear PFDs while working on the deck. There are currently no mandates by regulatory agencies for these workers to wear PFDs. Past research conducted by NIOSH examined the predictors of PFD use in the fishing industry in Alaska. Workers who believed that PFDs are an <b>entanglement</b> <b>hazard</b> had low PFD use, as did workers who believed that PFDs interfere with work. Workers may wear PFDs more often if they are familiar with newer models that have features which alleviate their concerns regarding comfort. The NIOSH Alaska Pacific Office conducted a study to determine which type of commercially available PFD resulted in the highest satisfaction in actual fishing industry working conditions. Different vessels have unique on-deck work processes, thus four vessel types were targeted: crabbers (vessels dropping baited pots to catch crab {{on the ocean floor}}), longliners (vessels anchoring strings of baited hooks on the ocean floor to catch a variety of bottom fish), gillnetters (vessels towing gillnets to catch primarily salmon), and trawlers (vessels towing large trawl nets to catch groundfish and pelagic fish). Six PFD models were selected to provide a variety of features to test for comfort and functionality. The study revealed that workers on different types of fishing vessels had varying preferences for PFDs. Because no regulations mandating the use of PFDs exist, manufacturers may have more success in supplying PFDs if they engage workers in the design and promotion of newer, more comfortable PFDs. Impact Based on the results of the NIOSH PFD study, a national PFD manufacturer realized there was a need for innovative PFD designs to improve comfort for workers in the fishing industry. They extended the NIOSH study and took a variety of commercially available PFDs to test on several boats where crewmembers gave feedback on the mobility of each PFD. Based on their market research, the company developed a prototype designed to be worn under bibs and raingear with 12 lbs. of flotation, the optimal amount to maintain a low profile while still maintaining buoyancy. This new vest could be worn continuously, even when going ashore, but would still allow buoyancy in case of a fall overboard. This prototype was field-tested for continuous wear and a number of adjustments were made based on fishermen's feedback, including shortening the overall height of the vest and adding indentations on the sides for flexibility when sitting and stepping up, increasing the diameter of the armholes to increase range of motion, lowering the neck to aid in looking downward, and adding reflective loops where gear could be secured to replace pockets that would catch on equipment. Their final product is now commercially available. Has logo for the Research to Practice at NIOSH initiative (r 2 p). NIOSHTIC No. 2004537...|$|R
