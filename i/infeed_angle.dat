40|$|Variations {{in cutting}} forces were {{investigated}} experimentally depending on infeed angles and cutting {{areas in the}} external threading on a CNC turning centre. For this purpose, AISI 1050 workpiece material, 16 ERM AG 60 IC 908 cutting tool, and SER 2525 M 16 tool holder were used. External threading operations were performed using 0 ◦, 14. 5 ◦, 15 ◦, 27. 5 ◦, and 30 ◦ infeed angles while the cutting speed was held constant at 100 m/min for the experiments. Experimental {{results showed that the}} <b>infeed</b> <b>angle</b> and cutting area had significant effects on the main cutting force and the radial force components were considerable in threading operations in terms of energy consumption. In addition, the optimum <b>infeed</b> <b>angle</b> was 30 ◦ in the external threading operations in terms of cutting forces...|$|E
