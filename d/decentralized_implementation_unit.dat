40|$|Model {{predictive}} control (MPC) {{is one of}} the few advanced control methodologies that have proven to be very successful in real-life control applications. MPC has the capability to guarantee optimality with respect to a de- sired performance cost function, while explicitly taking con- straints into account. Recently, there has been an increas- ing interest in the usage of MPC schemes to control power networks. The major obstacle for implementation lies in the large scale of power networks, which is prohibitive for a centralized approach. In this paper we critically assess and compare the suitability of three model {{predictive control}} schemes for controlling power networks. These techniques are analyzed with respect to the following relevant characteristics: the performance of the closed-loop system, which is evaluated and compared to the performance achieved with the classical automatic generation control (AGC) structure; the <b>decentralized</b> <b>implementation,</b> which is investigated in terms of size of the models used for prediction, required measurements and data communication, type of cost function and the computational time required by each algorithm to obtain the control action.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{investigate}} two selective relaying schemes in cooperative OFDM systems. Selective OFDMA relay-ing, where the relay selection is {{performed in a}} per-subcarrier manner, and selective OFDM relaying, where one best relay among the L potential relays is selected to relay the entire OFDM block, are compared in a two-hop random network. The outage performance of Equal Bit Allocation (EBA), where each subchannel has {{the same number of}} bits, and Bit Loading (BL), where bits are adaptively allocated to each subchannel, are analyzed and compared for these two approaches. The outage analysis clearly shows that a significant performance gain can be achieved by selective OFDMA relaying, whether EBA or BL is employed, compared with selective OFDM relaying. The performance gain remains the same for different relay locations. With EBA, the performance gain increases with an increase in L and N, the number of independent subchannels. For BL, the performance gain also increases with an increase in R, the average number of bits per subchannel, in addition to L and N. Centralized and <b>decentralized</b> <b>implementation</b> issues are also considered. For EBA, selective OFDMA relaying scheme is preferred because of its superior performance and simple <b>decentralized</b> <b>implementation.</b> For BL, selective OFDMA relaying scheme is a good choice for centralized systems and selective OFDM relaying is more suitable for decentralized systems at the expense of a loss in performance.

40|$|In {{a typical}} Internet of Things (IoT) {{application}} where a central controller collects status updates from multiple terminals, e. g., sensors and monitors, through a wireless multiaccess uplink, an important problem {{is how to}} attain timely status updates autonomously. In this paper, the timeliness of the status {{is measured by the}} recently proposed age-of-information (AoI) metric; both the theoretical and practical aspects of the problem are investigated: we aim to obtain a scheduling policy with minimum AoI and, meanwhile, still suitable for <b>decentralized</b> <b>implementation</b> on account of signalling exchange overhead. Towards this end, we first consider the set of arrival-independent and renewal (AIR) policies; the optimal policy thereof to minimize the time-average AoI is proved to be a round-robin policy with one-packet (latest packet only and others are dropped) buffers (RR-ONE). The optimality is established based on a generalized Poisson-arrival-see-time-average (PASTA) theorem. It is further proved that RR-ONE is asymptotically optimal among all policies in the massive IoT regime. The AoI steady-state stationary distribution under RR-ONE is also derived. A fully <b>decentralized</b> <b>implementation</b> of RR-ONE is proposed which can accommodate dynamic terminal appearances. In addition, considering scenarios where packets cannot be dropped, the optimal AIR policy thereof is also found with parameters given by the solution to a convex problem.
