50|$|The {{blockade}} {{which first}} {{gave rise to}} serious theoretical discussion on the subject was that instituted by France in 1884 in Chinese waters. On the 20th of October 1884 Admiral Courbet declared a blockade of all the ports and roadsteads between certain specified points of the island of Formosa. The British government protestmi that Admiral Coubert had not enough ships to render the blockade effective, {{and that it was}} therefore a violation of one of the articles of the Declaration of Paris of 1856; moreover, that the French government could only interfere with neutral vessels violating the blockade if there was a state of war. If a state of war existed, England as a neutral was bound to close her coaling stations to belligerents. The British government held that in the circumstances France was waging war and not entitled to combine the rights of peace and warfare for her own benefit. Since then pacific blockades have only been exercised by the great powers as a <b>joint</b> <b>measure</b> in their common interest, which has also been that of peace; and in this respect the term is taking a new signification in accordance with the ordinary sense of the word pacific.|$|E
40|$|One obtains Bell’s inequalities if one posits a {{hypothetical}} joint probability distribution, or measure, whose marginals yield the probabilities {{produced by the}} spin measurements in question. The existence of a <b>joint</b> <b>measure</b> is in turn equivalent to a certain causality condition known as “screening off”. We show that if one assumes, more generally, a joint quantal measure, or “decoherence functional”, one obtains instead an analogous inequality weaker {{by a factor of}} √ 2. The proof of this “Tsirel’son inequality” is geometrical and rests on the possibility of associating a Hilbert space to any strongly positive quantal measure. These results lead both to a question: “Does a <b>joint</b> <b>measure</b> follow from some quantal analog of ‘screening off’?”, and to the observation that non-contextual hidden variables are viable in histories-based quantum mechanics, even if they are excluded classically. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that the <b>joint</b> <b>measures</b> on the product of spin-space and {{disorder}} space are very often non-Gibbsian measures, for lattice systems with quenched disorder, at low temperature. Are there reflections of this non-Gibbsianness in the corresponding mean-field models? We study the continuity properties of the conditional probabilities in finite volume of the following mean field models: (a) <b>joint</b> <b>measures</b> of random field Ising, (b) <b>joint</b> <b>measures</b> of dilute Ising, (c) decimation of ferromagnetic Ising. The conditional probabilities are functions of the empirical mean of the conditionings; so {{we look at the}} large volume behavior of these functions to discover non-trivial limiting objects. For (a) we find (1) discontinuous dependence for almost any realization and (2) dependence of the conditional probabilities on the phase. In contrast to that we see continuous behavior for (b) and (c), for almost any realization. This is in complete analogy to the behavior of the corresponding lattice models in high dimensions. It shows that non-Gibbsian behavior which seems a genuine lattice phenomenon can be partially understood already on the level of mean-field models. ...|$|R

40|$|To learn (statistical) {{dependencies}} among {{random variables}} requires exponentially large sample {{size in the}} number of observed random variables if any arbitrary joint probability distribution can occur. We consider the case that sparse data strongly suggest that the probabilities can be described by a simple Bayesian network, i. e., by a graph with small in-degree Δ. Then this simple law will also explain further data with high confidence. This is shown by calculating bounds on the VC dimension of the set of those probability measures that correspond to simple graphs. This allows to select networks by structural risk minimization and gives reliability bounds on the error of the estimated <b>joint</b> <b>measure</b> without (in contrast to a previous paper) any prior assumptions on the set of possible joint measures. The complexity for searching the optimal Bayesian networks of in-degree Δ increases only polynomially {{in the number of}} random varibales for constant Δ and the optimal <b>joint</b> <b>measure</b> associated with a given graph can be found by convex optimization.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{recovering}} a common set of covariates that are relevant simultaneously to several classification problems. We propose a <b>joint</b> <b>measure</b> of complexity for the group of problems that couples covariate selection. By penalizing the sum of ℓ 2 -norms of the blocks of coefficients associated with each covariate across different classification problems, we encourage similar sparsity patterns in all models. To fit parameters under this regularization, we propose a blockwise boosting scheme that follows the regularization path. As the regularization coefficient decreases, the algorithm maintains and updates concurrently a growing set of covariates that are simultaneously active for all problems. We show empirically that this approach outperforms independent ℓ 1 -based covariate selection on several data sets, both in accuracy and number of selected covariates. ...|$|E
40|$|A fully {{automatic}} method is proposed {{to produce an}} enhanced image from a very noisy sequence consisting of a translating object over a background with different translation motion. The method is based on averaging registered versions of the frames in which the object has been motion compensated. Conventional techniques for displacement estimation are not adequate for these very noise sequences, and thus a new strategy has been used {{taking advantage of the}} simple model of the sequences. First, the local spatio-temporal spectrum is estimated through a bank of multidirectional/multiscale third order Gaussian derivative filters, yielding a representation of the sequence that facilitates further processing and analysis tasks. Then, energy-related measurements describing the local texture and motion are easily extracted from this representation. These descriptors are used to segment the sequence based on a local <b>joint</b> <b>measure</b> of motion and texture. Once the object of interest has been segmen [...] ...|$|E

As a corollary, we obtain a full variational principle for quasilocal <b>measures.</b> For the <b>joint</b> <b>measures</b> of the random field Ising model, we show that the weak Gibbs property holds, with an almost surely rapidly decaying translation invariant potential.

40|$|We {{consider}} general quenched disordered lattice spin {{models on}} compact local spin spaces with possibly dependent disorder. We discuss their corresponding <b>joint</b> <b>measures</b> {{on the product}} space of disorder variables and spin variables in the infinite volume. These measures often possess pathologies in a low temperature region reminiscent of renormalization group pathologies {{in the sense that}} they are not Gibbs measures on the product space. Often the <b>joint</b> <b>measures</b> are not even almost Gibbs, but it is known that there is always a potential for their conditional expectations that may however only be summable on a full measure set, and not everywhere. In this note we complement the picture from the non-pathological side.

We prove unicity and Lipschitz-continuity, much in analogy to the two fundamental regularity theorems proved for renormalization group transformations. ...|$|R

However, less information, even though all information is public and contractible, can in fact be desirable from a profit maximization perspective because of an interaction between the two problems. Choosing an information system that provides less information serves as a substitute for commitment for the principal in our model.

The HFR measure is a conditional <b>joint</b> <b>measure</b> of market risk and liquidity risk for irregularly spaced high-frequency data.

A new class of priors for dependent random measures is proposed for the collection of random mixing measures at each location.

40|$|A general {{method for}} {{selecting}} the tuning parameter in minimum distance estimators is proposed. The performance of this method, which involves minimising a data-based {{estimate of the}} asymptotic mean squared error function, is illustrated by its application to three different minimum distance estimators using simulated data. The choice of model family is subjective but information about the number and magnitude of outliers in the data is not needed because thereafter the method is entirely data-based. This approach is shown to optimise the performance of minimum distance methods by delivering estimators which are appropriate for the data. That is to say that, providing the correct family of models is chosen, the resulting estimators will be highly efficient when the method is applied to clean data and robust under contamination. Furthermore, utilising the asymptotic mean squared error function as a <b>joint</b> <b>measure</b> of robustness and efficiency in this way leads to a common framework for assessing the performance of many different minimum distance estimators.

Centralized PSO, based on virtual particles (VPs), is introduced for single layer and cross-layer subcarrier allocation to improve the bit error rate performance in multipath frequency selective fading channels. In the single layer strategy, the subcarriers are allocated based on the channel gains. In the cross-layer strategy, the subcarriers are allocated based on a <b>joint</b> <b>measure</b> of channel gains and distance provided by the physical layer and network layer to mitigate the effect of path loss.
