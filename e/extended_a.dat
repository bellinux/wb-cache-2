5|$|Although {{multiple}} {{funding sources}} were originally {{considered by the}} NEDA to fund the airport's construction, {{it was decided that}} the project should avail of an official development assistance facility offered by the Japanese government through the then-newly formed Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).

40|$|The Simple Argument 1. It Is good to save someone’s life, if {{and only}} if it is a life worth living. 2. When we save someone’s life we are merely {{extending}} their life. 3. If saving a life is good, and saving a life is identical in all relevant characteristics to <b>extending</b> <b>a</b> life, then <b>extending</b> <b>a</b> life must be good. 4. Surely, if <b>extending</b> <b>a</b> life by a limited period is good, then <b>extending</b> <b>a</b> life for an indefinite period would create a vast amount of good. 5. Therefore, <b>extending</b> <b>a</b> life worth living indefinitely is good. The Life Shape Hypothesis claims that the value of a life is at least partially determined by its shape of good events. If someone were to have her life extended indefinitely, then, in most cases, there would not be a discernible shape. Does indefinite life extensions eliminate the value that could have been captured by having a certain shape...|$|R

5|$|Following the storm, three New York {{counties}} were declared {{eligible for}} individual assistance, eight for individual and public assistance, and four for public assistance. The initial deadline {{to apply for}} state or federal assistance was set for November 17, although it was <b>extended</b> <b>a</b> month due to {{a steady flow of}} applications. Three disaster recovery centers were opened to provide information to residents affected by the storm. The three centers, located in Rockland, Putnam, and Westchester counties, closed in late October.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, M-57 was {{designated}} from M-66 (now M-91) near Langston to M-47 (now M-52) in St. Charles. By the mid 1936, the section between Ithaca and St. Charles {{was removed from}} the state highway system when the designation was shifted south to run between Ashley and Chesaning. In the process, M-57 was run concurrently along US27 between Ithaca and Ashley. The western section was similarly shifting by May 1938. The new routing started at a junction with US131 between Rockford and Cedar Springs and continued through Greenville and Carson City to Ashley. The eastern end was also extended from Chesaning to the Clio area. It was <b>extended</b> <b>a</b> second time by early 1941 to a junction with Belsay Road. By the middle of 1946, the eastern end was <b>extended</b> <b>a</b> third time to end in Otisville. M-57 was lengthened after a western extension in late 1948 or early 1949. The highway was routed concurrently with US131 to Cedar Springs and then west to M-37 at Kent City.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{years after}} the 1917 Russian Revolution, Du Bois <b>extended</b> <b>a</b> trip to Europe to include {{a visit to the}} Soviet Union. Du Bois was struck by the poverty and {{disorganization}} he encountered in the Soviet Union, yet was impressed by the intense labors of the officials and by the recognition given to workers. Although Du Bois was not yet familiar with the communist theories of Karl Marx or Vladimir Lenin, he concluded that socialism may be a better path towards racial equality than capitalism.|$|E

This includes a large brick dorm complex built by Russell Sage College (RSC) in the early 1960s. It was the college's last large-scale construction project in the city; with its inclusion all of RSC would be within the district. To its south another proposed extension reaches across a small park on First to include the 1905 Beth Tephilah synagogue, a neoclassical brick structure that retains most of its integrity.|$|E
5|$|The rebels had {{previously}} been completely disinherited, and their land taken into the king's hands. The Dictum instead <b>extended</b> <b>a</b> pardon, and restored land to their previous owners, contingent on payment of certain penalties that were proportional {{to the level of}} involvement in the rebellion. It was traditional to value land at ten times its annual yield, and most of the rebels were subsequently fined at half of this amount: five times the annual yield of their lands.|$|E

According to a story told at the highway's dedication, by an engineer who surveyed the highway, his group was approached by a sheep rancher and asked what they were doing. The rancher fell over laughing when he was told they were building a freeway.|$|E

5|$|Early on 20 January, the BOM {{upgraded}} the low to {{a tropical}} cyclone, {{at which time}} it was given the name Magda. However, there is uncertainty whether the system actually obtained this strength or if it strengthened hours later. At {{the time of the}} upgrade, Magda featured deep convection over its centre, but banding features <b>extended</b> <b>a</b> little more than halfway around the circulation. Later that day, the small cyclone underwent a period of rapid intensification as an eye feature became apparent in satellite imagery. In response to an approaching trough, Magda tracked towards the southeast. Around 2100UTC, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Magda, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 08S. Over the following several hours, the eye feature became increasingly defined, allowing the storm to intensify into a severe tropical cyclone by 0000UTC on 21 January. Upon reaching this strength, Magda attained ten-minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph) and a barometric pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg). However, shear abruptly increased hours later, causing the low-level circulation of Magda to become displaced from the deepest convection.|$|E
5|$|Juan Pablo Montoya {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside Ralf Schumacher. Michael Schumacher, the eventual Drivers' Champion started fourth, behind Mika Häkkinen of McLaren. The race {{was marked by}} an airborne accident going into the first corner involving Michael Schumacher and Luciano Burti for Prost, which caused the track to be scattered with shreds of carbon fibre and the race restarted as a result. Both Williams drivers retained their positions {{at the end of}} the first lap, with Michael Schumacher passing Häkkinen for third. Over the course of the race, Montoya <b>extended</b> <b>a</b> considerable lead over Ralf Schumacher. Montoya lost the lead on lap 24 when an issue with a refulling rig caused him to be stationary for more than 20 seconds. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead and held it to win his third victory of the season.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United drew {{their first}} and only home blank of the season against Newcastle United, but made amends with a 3–2 victory over bottom team Blackburn Rovers. Defensive frailties, most notably from Schmeichel, were on show away to Sheffield Wednesday as the team missed {{the chance to go}} top of the table. A brace from winger Jens Niclas Alexandersson and a debut goal scored by Wim Jonk {{consigned}} Ferguson to his second defeat in the league and <b>extended</b> <b>a</b> barren run at Hillsborough; United had won only a single game in their last eight visits. On 29 November, Manchester United hosted Leeds United and a valiant performance by the visitors looked to have gained them a draw, after going two goals down in the first half. A moment of brilliance from Butt however secured the three points for the Red Devils and kept up the pressure on the challengers.|$|E

5|$|Michael Schumacher, the {{eventual}} Drivers' Champion, led the Championship {{going into the}} race and started from fourth position alongside Barrichello. At the first corner BAR's Ricardo Zonta ran into the rear of Michael Schumacher. The incident forced the German to retire and caused a safety car deployment. After the safety car pulled in after one lap Häkkinen and Coulthard <b>extended</b> <b>a</b> comfortable lead {{over the rest of}} the field. When Häkkinen made his pit stop on lap 38, he rejoined behind Coulthard, but ahead of Barrichello. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 41, allowing Häkkinen back into the lead which he held to clinch his second victory of the 2000 season.|$|E
5|$|NY275 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to the portion of its modern alignment between the village of Bolivar and the hamlet of Friendship. At the time, NY275's northern terminus was at its intersection with West Main Street (now CR20) in Friendship, then part of NY63 and later NY408. In the early 1970s, the portion of the Southern Tier Expressway near Friendship was completed and opened to traffic. However, NY275 continued to end at NY408 in Friendship until the mid-1970s when NY408 was truncated to Nunda. As a result, NY275 was <b>extended</b> <b>a</b> short distance northward to meet the Southern Tier Expressway at exit29.|$|E
5|$|NY35 {{was split}} up into two routes {{in the early}} 1940s. The portion of old NY35 west of Ontario Center Road became NY383 while the Ontario Center Road section became part of an {{extended}} NY350. The extension created an overlap between NY350 and NY33B from Cator Corners to NY33. NY33 was truncated on its east end to downtown Rochester on January1, 1949. As a result, NY33B was redesignated as NY31F. The easternmost leg of the route still overlapped NY350; however, it now followed NY350 south to NY31 in Macedon. NY350 was <b>extended</b> <b>a</b> short distance northward in the mid-1940s to meet the new super two highway carrying US104 between Union Hill and Sodus.|$|E

5|$|On 3 November British {{warships}} bombarded outer forts in the Dardanelles. Two {{days later}} the United Kingdom <b>extended</b> <b>a</b> declaration of war to the Ottoman Empire, as did France. Due to these attacks, there was a common impression in Britain that Churchill had brought the Ottomans into the war. Prime Minister Lloyd George held this belief for several years to come. In the meantime, Churchill tried to promote {{the advantages of the}} conflict, such as the possibility of territorial gains in the Middle East (the reason that would ultimately bring Italy and Balkans nations like Greece into the war). The Ottoman government finally declared war on the Triple Entente on 11 November. Three days later Ottoman Sultan Mehmed V called for a Jihad campaign by Sunni and Shia Muslims against the Western powers.|$|E
5|$|The DR was {{extended}} to Uxbridge in 1910, by a connection made to the MR. In 1913, the Bakerloo Tube {{was extended}} to Paddington and to Queen's Park and Watford Junction four years later. The Hampstead tube was <b>extended</b> <b>a</b> short distance at its southern end to provide an interchange with the Bakerloo and the DR at Embankment in 1914. It was extended at its northern end from Golders Green into the Middlesex countryside to reach Edgware in 1924. In 1926, the Hampstead tube was extended south to connect to the C at Kennington {{in conjunction with a}} reconstruction of the C and its 1926 extension from Clapham Common to Morden. The CLR {{was extended to}} Ealing Broadway in 1920. Permission for an extension of the line to Richmond was obtained in 1913 and again in 1920, but was not used. Later, during 1932 and 1933, the Piccadilly Tube was extended at both ends: in the north from Finsbury Park to Cockfosters, and in the west from Hammersmith to Hounslow and Uxbridge using the DR's tracks.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{used the}} M-13 {{designation}} for a highway {{at the end}} of 1932 that connected M-78 and M-21 through Lennon. By the middle of 1936, the highway had been extended northward to end at a junction with M-46 in Saginaw. The entire trunkline was paved in the middle of 1939. Later the next year, the section in Saginaw was <b>extended</b> <b>a</b> bit farther along Washington Avenue to end at a junction with US10 and US23. A section of the then-M-78 freeway (now I-69) opened between 1958 and 1960; when this freeway opened, M-13 was truncated northwards slightly in the Lennon area to end at the new highway. The first section of the US23 freeway around Bay City opened in late 1960 or early 1961. When it opened, MSHD extended M-13 along the former route of US23 from the northside of Saginaw into Bay City {{to the end of the}} freeway at Kawkawlin. The I-75/US23 freeway north of the Kawkawlin area to Standish opened in 1967, and M-13 is shown on maps following US23's former route through Linwood and Pinconning after the change. The routing of M-13 has stayed the same since.|$|E
