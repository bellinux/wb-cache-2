Based on the shear flow equation at the narrow gap, a theoretical analysis of the effect of the applied magnetic field on the viscoplastic flow between two parallel disks is presented. The expression for the velocity in viscoplastic flow is derived. The results indicate that the velocity profile of MR fluid in shear region is deeply dependent on the gradient of the pressure in the flow channel. For the negative pressure gradient value, the velocity peak value point tends to move toward the driven disc wall as absolute value of pressure gradient increases.

40|$|The {{numerous}} patent applications on arrow-stabilized projectiles {{indicate that}} the idea of projectiles without spin is not new, but has appeared in various proposals throughout the last decades. As far as projectiles for subsonic speeds are concerned, suitable shapes have been developed for sometime, for example, numerous grenades. Most of the patent applications, though, are not practicable particularly for projectiles with supersonic speed. This is because the inventor usually does not have any knowledge of aerodynamic flow around the projectile nor any particular understanding of the practical solution. The lack of wind tunnels for the development of projectiles made it necessary to use firing tests for development. These are obviously extremely tedious or expensive and lead almost always to failures. The often expressed opinion that arrow-stabilized projectiles cannot fly supersonically can be traced to this condition. That {{this is not the case}} has been shown for the first time by Roechling on long projectiles with foldable fins. Since no aerodynamic investigations were made for the development of these projectiles, only tedious series of firing tests with systematic variation of the fins could lead to satisfactory results. These particular projectiles though have a disadvantage which lies in the nature cf foldable fins. They occasionally do not open uniformly in flight, thus causing unsymmetry in flow and greater scatter. The junctions of fins and body are very bad aerodynamically and increase the drag. It must be possible to develop high-performance arrow-stabilized projectiles based on the aerodynamic research conducted during the last few years at Peenemuende and new construction ideas. Thus the final shape, ready for operational use, could be developed in the wind tunnel without loss of expensive time in firing tests. The principle of arrow-stabilized performance has been applied to a large number of caliburs which were stabilized by various means Most promising was the development of a subcaliber wing-stabilized projectile with <b>driving</b> <b>disc</b> (Treibspiegel) where rigid control surfaces extend beyond the caliber of the projectile into the free stream.

The relevant physical mechanisms of steady-state accretion and ejection from Keplerian discs are explained in a model independent way. The results of self-similar calculations are shown and critically discussed, for both cold and warm jet configurations.

It will be shown that a large scale magnetic eld is expected to thread the innermost disc regions, giving rise to a transition from an outer standard accretion disc to an inner jet emitting disc.

Such a connection is now not only probed by modern observations {{but it is also}} requested for spinning down protostars, which are known to be both actively accreting and contracting. This spin down most probably relies on the angular momentum removal by ejection. Two such scenarios will be addressed here, namely "accretion-powered stellar winds " (Matt & Pudritz 2005) and "Reconnection X-winds " (Ferreira, Pelletier & Appl 2000). The latter can slow down a protostar on time scales shorter or comparable to the embedded phase. It will be shown that these two scenarios are not incompatible and that transitions from one to another may even occur as they mainly depend on the stellar dynamo...|$|R
40|$|The light {{curve of}} GW 170817 is {{surprisingly}} blue and bright. Assuming {{that the event}} is a binary neutron star merger, we argue that blueness and brightness of the light curve {{is the result of}} ejecta that contains an substantial amount of thermal energy. To achieve this, the ejecta must be reheated at a substantial distance (1 to 2000 solar radii) from the merger to avoid losing the energy to adiabatic cooling. We show that this reheating can occur if the merger occurs in a hierarchical triple system where the outer star has evolved and filled its Roche lobe. The outer star feeds mass to the inner binary, forming a circumbinary <b>disc,</b> <b>driving</b> the inner binary to merge. Because the outer star fills its Roche lobe, a substantial fraction of the dynamical ejecta collides with the evolved star, reheating the ejecta in the process. We suggest that the process of mass transfer in heirarchical triples tends to form coplanar triple systems such as PSR J 0337 + 1715, and may provide electromagnetic counterparts to binary black hole mergers.

40|$|The {{axisymmetric}} {{collapse of}} a cylindrical air cavity in water follows a universal power law with logarithmic corrections. Nonetheless, {{it has been suggested}} that the introduction of a small azimuthal disturbance induces a long term memory effect, reflecting in oscillations which are no longer universal but remember the initial condition. In this work, we create non-axisymmetric air cavities by <b>driving</b> a metal <b>disc</b> through an initially-quiescent water surface and observe their subsequent gravity-induced collapse. The cavities are characterized by azimuthal harmonic disturbances with a single mode number $m$ and amplitude $a_m$. For small initial distortion amplitude (1 or 2 % of the mean disc radius), the cavity walls oscillate linearly during collapse, with nearly constant amplitude and increasing frequency. As the amplitude is increased, higher harmonics are triggered in the oscillations and we observe more complex pinch-off modes. For small amplitude disturbances we compare our experimental results with the model for the amplitude of the oscillations by Schmidt et al. (2009) and the model for the {{collapse of a}}n axisymmetric impact-created cavity previously proposed by Bergmann et al. (2009 b). By combining these two models we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of the cavity at any time before pinch-off. Comment: 18 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

40|$|We have {{conducted}} {{the first comprehensive}} numerical investigation of the relative velocity distribution of dust particles in self-gravitating protoplanetary discs {{with a view to}} assessing the viability of planetesimal formation via direct collapse in such environments. The viability depends crucially on the large sizes that are preferentially collected in pressure maxima produced by transient spiral features (Stokes numbers, St ∼ 1); growth to these size scales requires that collision velocities remain low enough that grain growth is not reversed by fragmentation. We show that, for a single sized dust population, velocity <b>driving</b> by the <b>disc's</b> gravitational perturbations is only effective for St > 3, while coupling to the gas velocity dominates otherwise. We develop a criterion for understanding this result in terms of the stopping distance being of order the disc scale height. Nevertheless, the relative velocities induced by differential radial drift in multi-sized dust populations are too high to allow the growth of silicate dust particles beyond St ∼ 10 ^- 2 or 10 ^- 1 (10 cm to m sizes at 30 au), such Stokes numbers being insufficient to allow concentration of solids in spiral features. However, for icy solids (which may survive collisions up to several 10 m s^- 1), growth to St ∼ 1 (10 m size) may be possible beyond 30 au from the star. Such objects would be concentrated in spiral features and could potentially produce larger icy planetesimals/comets by gravitational collapse. These planetesimals would acquire moderate eccentricities and remain unmodified over the remaining lifetime of the disc. Comment: 19 pages, 18 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

5000|$|Electric {{energy meters}} {{that meet the}} {{requirement}} of N-1 elements for an N wire service are often said to be Blondel Compliant. This label identifies the meter as one that will measure correctly under all conditions when correctly installed. However, a meter doesn't have to be Blondel compliant {{in order to provide}} suitably accurate measurements and industry practice often includes the use of such non compliant meters. The form 2S meter is extensively used in the metering of residential three wire services, despite being non compliant in such services. This common residential service consists of two 120 volt wires and one neutral wire. A Blondel compliant meter for such a service would need two elements (and a five jaw socket to accept such a meter), but the 2S meter is a single element meter. The 2S meter includes one potential measuring device (a coil or a voltmeter) and two current measuring devices. The current measuring devices provide a measurement equal to one half of the actual current value. The combination of a single potential coil and two so called half coils provides highly accurate metering under most conditions. The meter has been used {{since the early days of}} the electrical industry. The advantages were the lower cost of a single potential coil and the avoidance of interference between two elements <b>driving</b> a single <b>disc</b> in an induction meter. For line to line loads, the meter is Blondel compliant. Such loads are two wire loads and a single element meter suffices. The non compliance of the meter occurs in measuring line to neutral loads. The meter design approximates a two element measurement by combining a half current value with the potential value of the line to line connection. The line to line potential is exactly twice the line to neutral connection if the two line to neutral connections are exactly balanced. Twice the potential times half the current then approximates the actual power value with equality under balanced potential. In the case of line to line loads, two times the half current value times the potential value equals the actual power. Error is introduced if the two line to line potentials are not balanced and if the line to neutral loads are not equally distributed. That error is given by 0.5(V1-V2)(I1-I2) where V1 and I1 are the potential and current connected between one line and neutral and V2 and I2 are those connected between the other line and neutral. [...] Since the industry typically maintains five percent accuracy in potential, the error will be acceptably low if the loads aren't heavily unbalanced.|$|R
