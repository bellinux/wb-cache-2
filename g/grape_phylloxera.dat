5|$|The {{variation}} of plant susceptibility to pests was probably known {{even in the}} early stages of agriculture in humans. In historic times, the observation of such variations in susceptibility have provided solutions for major socio-economic problems. The <b>grape</b> <b>phylloxera</b> was introduced from North America to France in 1860 and in 25 years it destroyed nearly a third (100,000km²) of the French grape yards. Charles Valentine Riley noted that the American species Vitis labrusca was resistant to Phylloxera. Riley, with J. E. Planchon, helped save the French wine industry by suggesting the grafting of the susceptible but high quality grapes onto Vitis labrusca root stocks.|$|E
5|$|The aphid {{that was}} the central source of the damage in France was first noted {{following}} the growing of the European vine Vitis vinifera by French colonists in Florida, in the 16th century. These plantations were a failure, and later experiments with related species of vine also failed, although the reason for these failures {{appears to have been}} a mystery to the French colonists. It is known today that it was a species of North American <b>grape</b> <b>phylloxera</b> that caused these early vineyards to fail; the venom injected by the Phylloxera causes a disease that is quickly fatal to the European varieties of vine. The aphids initially went unnoticed by the colonists, despite their great numbers, and the pressure to successfully start a vineyard in America at the time.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several {{theories}} proposed for why the phylloxera was ignored as the possible cause of the disease {{that resulted in the}} failure of so many vineyards, most of which involve the feeding behaviour of the insect, and the way it attacks the roots. The proboscis of the <b>grape</b> <b>phylloxera</b> has both a venom canal from which it injects its deadly venom and a feeding tube through which it takes in vine sap and nutrients. As the toxin from the venom corrodes the root structure of a vine, the sap pressure falls and, as a result, the Phylloxera quickly withdraws its feeding tube and searches for another source of food. Thus, anyone digging up a diseased and dying vine will not find Phylloxera clinging to the roots of the plant.|$|E

50|$|Leo Laliman was a {{winegrower}} and viticulturist from Bordeaux, France.

50|$|He {{was among}} the first to notice that the American grapes, Vitis labrusca were {{resistant}} to <b>grape</b> <b>Phylloxera.</b> His work with J. E.

50|$|Because of new <b>grapes</b> {{diseases}} (e.g. <b>phylloxera),</b> the canton {{government decided}} to give a new direction to the wine industry: they instituted the cattedra itinerante (moving chair) to teach modern viticulture and winemaking methods, and to substitute new high-value grapes for the local grapes.

5000|$|Historically, {{the winery}} {{produced}} syrah, pinot noir, Gewürztraminer, and chardonnay. Today, the winemaker is Christy Ackerman. The vineyard produces approximately 3,000 cases of wine. [...] The original founder, Hans Kobler, planted {{a variety of}} grapes, including Gewürztraminer. The vines he planted were phylloxera-resistant. This was experimental at the time, and his <b>grapes</b> survived <b>phylloxera</b> attacks. Today, his Gewürztraminer vines remain some of the oldest in the Anderson Valley AVA. They grew their grapes organically. Their Gewürztraminer was aged in 20-year-old barrels. Today, Ackerman ages the grapes in stainless steel barrels rather than oak. They produce three acres of Gewürztraminer wine and produce 100 cases. The property also has Pinot noir grapes, many which were originally planted by Kobler. The winery sells both Lazy Creek wine and Ferrari-Carano wine.|$|R
5000|$|Baco blanc was {{developed}} to produce {{some of the same}} flavors as Folle blanche but without the susceptibility to American <b>grape</b> disease and <b>phylloxera.</b> In the 20th century it was widely planted in the Gascony region for uses in brandy production.

50|$|Phylloxerids can {{transmit}} diseases to plants. Their importance {{is even more}} perceptible historically. In fact, Daktulosphaira vitifoliae known as the <b>grape</b> <b>phylloxera</b> is considered as the most economically important insect pest of commercial grapevines Vitis worldwide. In the late 19th century, the phylloxera epidemic destroyed almost all the European grapes and they could only fix the problem by planting grapes from the US, then grafting European grapes onto American roots.|$|E
50|$|This blight {{was brought}} on by a species of aphid that {{originated}} in North America and was carried across the Atlantic Ocean sometime in the late 1850s/early 1860s. However, how the phyolloxera had survived the journey remained a point of much debate; Europeans had experimented with American vines for centuries without any pestilential problems. Eventually, it was decided that, following the invention of steamboats, the <b>grape</b> <b>phylloxera</b> were able to survive the shortened journey.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} {{settlements}} on Brač, Donji Humac saw continuous growth since its settlement, gaining speed in the 19th century and reaching a height {{in the early}} 20th century - when particularly due to the <b>grape</b> <b>phylloxera</b> louse the local production of wine broke down. This destroyed many of the available local economic opportunities, and to a large wave of emigration. People from Donji Humac have moved to Antofagasta in Chile, Perth in Australia, Auckland in New Zealand, and the United States and later also Germany.|$|E
50|$|Over {{a hundred}} {{varieties}} of grapes (castas) are sanctioned for port production, although only five (Tinta Barroca, Tinta Cão, Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo), Touriga Francesa, and Touriga Nacional) are widely cultivated and used. Touriga Nacional {{is widely considered}} the most desirable port grape but the difficulty in growing it and the small yields cause Touriga Francesa {{to be the most}} widely planted grape. White ports are produced the same way as red ports, except that they use white grapes—Donzelinho Branco, Esgana-Cão, Folgasão, Gouveio, Malvasia Fina, Rabigato and Viosinho. While a few shippers have experimented with Ports produced from a single variety of grapes, all Ports commercially available are from a blend of different <b>grapes.</b> Since the <b>Phylloxera</b> crisis, most vines are grown on grafted rootstock, with the notable exception of the Nacional area of Quinta do Noval, which, since being planted in 1925, has produced some of the most expensive vintage ports.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th Century, {{hybridization}} {{became a}} popular avenue of research for stopping the phylloxera louse. Hybridization is the breeding of Vitis vinifera with resistant species. Most native American <b>grapes</b> are naturally <b>phylloxera</b> resistant (Vitis aestivalis, rupestris, and riparia are particularly so, while Vitis labrusca has a somewhat weak resistance to it) but have aromas that are off-putting to palates accustomed to European grapes. The intent of the cross was to generate a hybrid vine that was resistant to phylloxera but produced wine that did not taste like the American grape. Ironically, the hybrids tend not to be especially resistant to phylloxera, although they are much more hardy with respect to climate and other vine diseases. The new hybrid varieties have never gained the popularity of the traditional ones. In the EU they are generally banned or at least strongly discouraged from use in quality wine, although they are still in widespread use in much of North America, such as Missouri, Ontario, and upstate New York.|$|R
40|$|Free {{amino acid}} {{constituents}} were determined of <b>grape</b> stem and <b>Phylloxera</b> leaf gall callus in tissue culture.

Stem and gall clones showed qualitative similarities and quantitative {{variations in the}} amino acids and nitrogenous constituents. Nineteen amino acids, glucosamine, ethanolamine, sarcosine, methionine sulfoxides and ammonia were identified. Two free polypeptides accounted for over 30 % of the amino compounds in the stem and gall callus tissues which were {{not found in the}} intact plant parts. Stem clones of different growth rates grown on agar showed generally an excess of amino acid constituents over gall tissues of similar growth rates, except for the free polypeptides. Fast growing stem clones grown on agar medium contained lower amounts of certain amino acids than the fast growing gall clones, but when grown in liquid medium they contained higher amounts of these acids than the gall clones. The total and nonsoluble nitrogen of stem clones were higher than in the gall clones. Tissue cultures differed from the original plant parts with respect to their free polypeptides and high amino acid contents...|$|R
5000|$|Laliman {{became quite}} a {{controversial}} figure following his and Bazille's discovery. While he was widely acclaimed and praised for his theory and its success, and was uncontroversially accredited for finding {{the solution to}} the problem, many others mistrusted his method, and were decidedly against grafting their rootstock with American vines. Others mistrusted him personally, and some claimed that he was, in fact, responsible for the introduction of the <b>grape</b> <b>phylloxera.</b> This public suspicion of Laliman may have been the true reason that the French government was against awarding Laliman the prize for [...] "curing the blight".|$|E
50|$|In medieval times, {{most of the}} {{population}} of Brač was living inland, as the coast was too dangerous due to pirate and other attacks. During that time, the northwest of the island belonged to Donji Humac, including the settlements Sutivan and Mirca - both of which are quite larger than Donji Humac today. In the 20th century, the worsening of the economic situation in Donji Humac - first through the <b>grape</b> <b>phylloxera</b> louse which destroyed several grape harvests and thus the wine production, later World War II and its aftermath - lead to several waves of emigration, leaving Donji Humac today with only a third or quarter of {{the population}} only a century ago.|$|E
50|$|The first {{instance}} of the blight was recorded sometime in the early 1860s, and France suffered the blight for a 15-year period, without any solution. Eventually, Jules-Emile Planchon and two colleagues made an important discovery; the discovery that sourced the aphid phylloxera to the blight itself — up until then, {{the source of the}} damage was unknown. In 1870, American entomologist Charles Valentine Riley confirmed Planchon's theory. However, this discovery caused controversy; some met it with optimism, saying that now that the cause had been found, it would just be a matter of elimination. Others disagreed completely with the theory, saying that the <b>grape</b> <b>phylloxera</b> were merely a symptom, an effect, of the blight, rather than the source.|$|E
5000|$|Black Spanish is {{now known}} to be a {{seedling}} of an American hybrid grape resulting from a cross of the American Vitis aestivalis species of grape with an unknown Vitis vinifera pollen donor. This hybridization is not known to have been purposeful, and may have occurred naturally, {{as was the case with}} many of the early American grape cultivars. Recently, it was revealed from the microsatellite DNA (a.k.a. Simple Sequence Repeats or SSRs) analyses conducted on various 'Jacquez cultivars' by Dr Jerry Rodrigues that at least two of the European accessions (grapevine collections) which are presently curated in Europe were originally derived from the oldest known Jacquez cultivar (the Madeira Jacquez). The original American hybrid grape parent had found its way to the Madeira Islands early in the 18th century (where it was called Jaquez or Jacquet) and thence to France. Lenoir is another such seedling similar to Black Spanish which was propagated by Herbemont. Many other historical names appeared on the scene throughout the early history of these Jacquez seedlings such as Jack, Blue French, Ohio, and El Paso, among others. For example, Herbemont tells us that he received Lenoir seeds from a man named Lenoir who cultivated it near Stateburg SC, in the vicinity of the Santee River sometime in the 18th Century. Lenoir made its way to Texas early, where it even took on the names El Paso and Black Spanish. From its wild South Carolina parent, Lenoir (and also Black Spanish) carries natural resistance to the Phylloxera pest, as well as to the deadly Pierce's Disease, which is a common threat to Vitis vinifera vineyards in warm winter areas of the United States. Lenoir was also one of the American vines which the grape breeder Thomas Volney Munson experimented with in the late 19th Century in Denison, Texas. Prior to its use by Munson, Lenoir was grown and used in wine by Nicholas Herbemont of Columbia, South Carolina in the 1830s, though to a lesser extent than the similar, lighter-skinned variety [...] "Warren" [...] ("Brown French") which become known as Herbemont because of his promotion of that variety. Lenoir was introduced to Europe in the mid-19th Century, where French vintners were intrigued by its similarity to European Vitis vinifera winegrapes, and gave it the names Jacquez and Jacquet. It became an important direct producing grape in Europe during the phylloxera crisis, and later was used to some extent as a rootstock to protect the classic vinifera <b>grapes</b> from <b>phylloxera.</b> Ulysses P. Hedrick's famous [...] "Grapes of New York" [...] in 1908 provides the seminal discussion of Lenoir and many of the early North American grapes.|$|R
