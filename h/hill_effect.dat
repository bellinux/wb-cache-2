The diurnal rodent Arvicanthis niloticus retina has around 35 % cones. Using ERG recordings, we studied retina function in this species. Several features differed from that reported in rats and mice: (a) fivefold larger photopic a-wave amplitudes; (b) photopic <b>hill</b> <b>effect</b> in Nile grass rats only; and (c) flicker amplitude plateau between 5 to 35 Hz with fusion beyond 60 Hz in Nile grass rats only.

40|$|The pun of {{a sketch}} from the Benny Hill show {{was related to}} a switch of {{cognitive}} in formation processing programmes underlying {{the interpretation of the}} scene represented. The audience would be biased to interpret it following a cognitive programme anchored on the constructs self and other (SO-programme), while Benny Hill makes a statement that would impose a cognitive programme anchored on constructs associated with the third pronominal person (3 P-programme). In an experiment it was attempted to make subjects to switch from SO- to 3 P-programmes (Benny <b>Hill</b> <b>effect)</b> when they were making subjective estimations of outcomes of bargains concerning distributions of rewards. The hypothesis was confirmed that the 3 P-programme was activated by providing additional in formation pertaining to substantiate the stimulus persons {{in such a way as}} to make them stand out as anchors for the processing of the in formation. However, the data showed also that the mere substantiation of stimulus persons was not yet sufficient to produce the given shift of cognitive programmes. The results are discussed in the light of theories concerning fairness, social values and allocation rules. status: publishe...|$|E

In {{the first half of}} the latent period, the resistance of complexes formed with nonrepairing bacteria increased considerably; with T 1 and E. coli B hcr−, in 4 min the resistance became the same as that of complexes formed with repairing bacteria. The repair ability of plating bacteria affected survival curves only upon irradiation in the second half of the latent period after mature phages were present in the initial complex. Use of nonrepairing bacteria both for initial infection and for plating of late complexes resulted in a series of survival curves showing for all three systems the same pattern of change originally reported for T 2 -E. coli B complexes. Thus, a hitherto unexplained difference between radiation survival curves for T-even and T-odd phages seems due to repair of T-odd phages by the host...|$|E

40|$|Y {{chromosomes}} {{are genetically}} degenerate, having {{lost most of}} the active genes that were present in their ancestors. The causes of this degeneration have attracted much attention from evolutionary theorists. Four major theories are reviewed here: Muller's ratchet, background selection, the <b>Hill</b> Robertson <b>effect</b> with weak selection, and the 'hitchhiking' of deleterious alleles by favourable mutations. All of these involve a reduction in effective population size {{as a result of}} selective events occurring in a non-recombining genome, and the consequent weakening of the efficacy of selection. We review the consequences of these processes for patterns of molecular evolution and variation at loci on Y chromosomes, and discuss the results of empirical studies of these patterns for some evolving Y-chromosome and neo-Y-chromosome systems. These results suggest that the effective population sizes of evolving Y or neo-Y chromosomes are severely reduced, as expected if {{some or all of the}} hypothesized processes leading to degeneration are operative. It is, however, currently unclear which of the various processes is most important; some directions for future work to help to resolve this question are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{geography}} and geology of Pine Township have {{played an important}} role in its history. Pine Township lies within the southern limits of the most recent ice age. This land was once covered with glaciers. As the glaciers receded they scoured the land creating a moraine, knob like hills, and kettle holes. Some of these kettles are at the top of the hill. This has caused the unusual formation of a swamp at the top of a <b>hill.</b> The <b>effects</b> of glaciation created soil characteristics that limited successful farming and steep hillsides that also cut down on the amount of farmable land. Therefore, trees have thrived in Pine Township. The old-growth forests were harvested in the mid-to-late 19th century during the lumber era that swept throughout the hills and valleys of Pennsylvania. Massive stands of hemlock and pine were chopped down and floated down Little Pine and Pine Creeks to the sawmills of Williamsport. Since the end of the lumbering era and thriving second growth forest has grown throughout Pine Township.|$|R

40|$|Tornado {{forces on}} {{structures}} {{have been a}} research focus for the past decades, and some comparisons {{have been made to}} distinguish between straight boundary layer (SBL) wind and tornado wind forces on specific structures. However, very little {{attention has been paid to}} terrain effects on tornado damage and path. Available damage investigation data for four tornado locations (Joplin- 2011, Tuscaloosa- 2011, Parish- 2011 and Mayflower- 2014) is utilized to explore terrain effects on tornado damage and path. Google Earth, site visits and aerial images are employed to study the influence of terrain on an extent of damage and path variation. Additionally, a three dimensional computer model is developed by employing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to study terrain (<b>hills)</b> <b>effects</b> on tornado path deviation and tornado forces reduction in the sheltered region. From the study, it is concluded that there is a significant <b>effect</b> of <b>hills</b> on tornado damage. Much damage is observed on the windward side of a hill comparing to its leeward side. When the tornado crosses the investigated hills, the hills provide sheltered zone on its leeward side. Furthermore, measurements of the sheltered zone on the leeward side of the investigated hills show that the sheltered zone length is about five times the hill height (5 H) along tornado travelling path. After that, a modified version of the computer model presented in Selvam and Millet (2002) is utilized to simulate tornado-terrain interaction, and then the model is validated for further investigation of terrain effects on tornado path deviation and forces. The Navier–Stokes equations are approximated by the finite elements method (FEM), and the numerical domain is discretized using a terrain following coordinate system. It is shown that the ratio of tangential velocity to translational velocity (Vθ/Vt) significantly affects the tornado deviation shape when a tornado interacts with the investigated 2 D hill. The deviation shape changes from straight line to double curvature shape as the ratio (Vθ/Vt) increases. The UA numerical results for tornado path deviation shape are comparable to field data (single and no curvature) for (Vθ/Vt) 3 ̆c 4. The UA Numerical results for (Vϴ/Vt) 3 ̆e 4 are comparable to wind tunnel data (Vθ/Vt ≈ 45) in which the deviation is double curvature. Therefore, the computer model is considered for further investigation. Finally, the computer model is utilized to measure tornado forces on a sheltered dome building. Rounded and triangular hill profiles are considered with varied heights, and it is concluded that the hills reduce tornado forces and velocities on their leeward side. The computer model outcome is that tornado forces applied on a structure are reduced by more than 70...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate skeletal muscle force production during isometric contractions, active muscle stretches and shortenings. The motivation behind this work is to improve the dominant model of muscle contraction force generation based on the theories of <b>Hill.</b> The <b>effect</b> of force modification was observed after concentric and eccentric contractions and also stretch-shortening cycles. It has been shown that this force modification is not related to lengthening/shortening velocity, and the steady-state force after non-isometric contractions can be well described by initial isometric force and mechanical work performed by and on the muscle during length variations. The time constants calculated for isometric force redevelopment appeared to be in certain relations with those for initial isometric force development, an observation which extended our basis for ongoing muscle modeling. The main method of the project consists in two extensive series of experiments on mouse skeletal muscles. Analysis of the first series of experiments, concentric contractions, with an emphasis on the force depression has been presented in Paper 1.

Considering disease spread across multiple scales in a spatial hierarchy allows one to capture important features of epidemics developing in space without using explicitly spatialized variables. Thus, if the system under study is composed of roots, plants, and planting <b>hills,</b> the <b>effect</b> of host spatial pattern can be studied by varying the number of plants per planting hill. A simulation model based on hierarchy theory was used to simulate the effects of large versus small planting hills, low versus high level of initial infections, and aggregated versus uniform distribution of initial infections.
