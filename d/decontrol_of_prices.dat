50|$|Government {{efforts to}} take over the credit {{expansion}} also proved ephemeral {{in the early years of}} the transition. Domestic credit increased about nine times between the end of 1991 and 1992. The credit expansion was caused in part by the buildup of interenterprise arrears and the RCB's subsequent financing of those arrears. The Government restricted financing to state enterprises after it lifted controls on prices in January 1992, but enterprises faced cash shortages because the <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> cut demand for their products. Instead of curtailing production, most firms chose to build up inventories. To support continued production under these circumstances, enterprises relied on loans from other enterprises. By mid-1992, when the amount of unpaid interenterprise loans had reached 3.2 trillion rubles (about US$20 billion), the government froze interenterprise debts. Shortly thereafter, the government provided 181 billion rubles (about US$1.1 billion) in credits to enterprises that were still holding debt.|$|E

This study suggests a formula that reflects fair and remunerative price for cane that takes into account both costs of production and international price trends.

40|$|As {{the supply}} of natural gas {{continues}} to dwindle, and government <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> <b>pricing</b> progresses, {{the rising cost of}} this essential natural resource will drive more individuals to consider various forms of pilferage as a way of reducing their financial burden. Today, according to numerous gas utilities, significant revenues are being lost via theft of service, losses which are ultimately passed on to the businesses' honest customers. A method to detect such thievery developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for Consolidated Edison of New York, was the design of a secondary flow metering device. Located outside a suspected concern, and placed within the small confines of a modified valve or pipe structure, its function is to act as a cross reference for the existing positive displacement meter. The concept chosen was the phenomena of vortex shedding, a fluid oscillatory instability which is used extensively as a measuruing technique in the process control industry. Feasibility studies were carried out using a flat, non-moving bluff shedding element and a piezo-electric bimorph ceramic cantilevered behind it. Both elements were situated within a curb valve based prototype design having a test section inner diameter of one inch. As predicted, experiments demonstrate a repeatable, linear relationship between frequency of oscillation and volume flow for flow rates between 200 and 1000 CFH. A requirement of less than one inch of water column pressure drop across the test section was also achieved. The output signal of the bimorph varied from millivolts to several volts throughout the same specified flow range. In addition, the oscillations may be simply counted to yield and integration of the total volume delivered. The success of the concept suggests that a Phase II program, in which the laboratory design is incorporated into a device suitable for rigorous field tests by the utility, should be pursued...|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the crude oil price increases, {{associated}} with the Middle East crisis, many countries, particularly Brazil, began producing ethanol for the use as fuel in mixture with gasoline. In the United States, 'gasohol', a blend of approximately 90 % gasoline and 10 % ethanol began to be marketed. It was quickly accepted in a market which at that time was being controlled by political and supply problems. Major global and domestic events such as the general glut in the world supply of crude oil, <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices,</b> lower demand for gasoline and the effect of the current administration on government funding and/or guarantees and the lack thereof, has resulted in a restructing and change in the industry.

40|$|Price {{controls}} often {{focus on}} commodities that are storable and {{can thus be}} used in intertemporal speculation. Second, opposition to dismantling of controls is often based on claims of low supply response, and greatly bolstered if a strong supply response fails to materialise. This is especially relevant in Eastern Europe, where experience with markets is limited. We show the difficulties that these two factors create for gradual <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices.</b> We endogenise {{the probability of a}} collapse of the reform programme and show that such endogeneity in the presence of intertemporal speculation leads to a strong case against gradualism. The smaller the initial price increase, the lower the observed supply elasticity and the greater the probability that the programme of reform will be abandoned. This implies that the policy that makes most sense from a microeconomic point of view (decontrol immediately) is also advisable from a macroeconomic point of view.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} a {{regulated}} industry undergoing rapid change. For {{the first time in}} its history, following the partial <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> field <b>prices</b> in 1978, natural gas is being priced at a level which places it in direct competition with competing fuels, chiefly oil. This change is placing considerable stress on the established institutional relationships in the gas industry and is the source of what has been and will continue to be a protracted public policy debate on the subject. It is the chief purpose of this study to interpret the effect of this change on the gas pipeline segment of the industry and its regulation. A second purpose is to explore the use of information from the capital market's valuation of natural gas pipeline securities, both as a means of characterizing the industry transition in the terms of financial economics and of evaluating the financial performance of the pipelines (and thus indirectly their regulators) during the transition. As such, the continuing <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> field <b>prices</b> constitutes a convenient "natural experiment" that allows us to characterize the likely nature of the gas industry of the future and ultimately to evaluate the various proposals for changing it. To accomplish these purposes, the study is divided into five parts. After describing the principal structural characteristics, transactional arrangements and regulatory procedures in the industry, the study investigates the origins and historical evolution of these features. This history is important in establishing the role of natural gas field price and pipeline regulatory policy and market conditions in determining the nature of the transactional arrangements prevalent today in the industry. This section closes with some conventional measures of the extent of the post- 1978 transition and the disequilibrium that now exists between gas market conditions, regulatory policy and industry transactional arrangments. In the next two chapters the tools of modern financial economics are used to characterize the effects of the industry transition on the systematic risk borne by gas pipeline industry investors. A significant secular increase in pipeline industry risk is found to persist during the transition period after 1978, an increase that is found to be directly associated with the partial <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> field <b>prices.</b> Other sources <b>of</b> risk are examined including what is termed "contractual leverage" [...] the leverage induced by rigid pipeline contractual relationships. These results are used to evaluate pipeline financial (and thus regulatory) performance during the transition. A significant deterioration in gas pipeline profitability is detected during this period. The study closes with an examination of the industry's transactional arrangements as they serve to allocate these risks under regulatory service obligations. It is observed that the current regulatory regime ratifies the longstanding transactional arrangements which bundle rights to gas reserves with rights to pipeline capacity. A substantial exogenous change in the risk conditions in the industry may require a regulatory regime which allows for more flexibility in gas supply transactions. It is suggested that to achieve this flexibility it may be necessary to unbundle the two types of rights, allowing a separate, unregulated market for gas reserves and production to form. This could lead to the formation of a liquid spot and futures market for gas, with consequential informational advantages for the rest of the market. This unbundling might be achieved with pipeline deregulation or a system of common carriage, the feasibility of which is examined in a preliminary manner. Supported by the U. S. Department of Energy.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the question whether}} CBI is an appropriate monetary institution for transition economies to change inflation dynamics and foster the transition process to a stable and efficient market economy. In this respect, we provide theoretical arguments and find empirical evidence.

The empirical results lead {{to the conclusion that the}} process <b>of</b> <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>prices</b> (or price liberalization) has a significant positive impact on inflation persistence in transition countries. However, in the presence of controls, there is no evidence to support conventional wisdom regarding the negative relation between CBI and inflation persistence. A reason for this conclusion is that such CBI is instrumental in reducing inflation persistence only when other structural features of the economy, such as the price liberalization, have become sufficiently and persistently similar to those of developed market economies. Consequently, in a period of severe macroeconomic imbalances, CBI doesn’t seem to be an institutional arrangement effective to stabilize the economy...|$|R

The authors characterize the comprehensive changes in {{the tax system}} that could be undertaken in the presence of system-wide reform, especially of prices and enterprises, as well as of more moderate reforms that must suffice in the absence of reforms elsewhere in the economic system. In connection with tax reform per se, they emphasize {{that it is possible to}} simplify significantly the rate structure for indirect taxes in the presence of price controls, but a unified rate for value-added tax is undesirable without full <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices.</b> They also found that the state's role as owner of enterprises must be treated separately from its role as tax collector. All enterprises should pay statutory profits taxes. Negotiation (of the kind that characterizes the contract responsibility system) should be confined to the payments to government from after-tax profits. Those payments could be set to balance incentives to enterprises with the need for the state to earn a return on assets historically provided free to those enterprises. The mode of analysis developed in this paper can be applied to a wider range of economies - whether emerging from a socialist past or not - that are progressing at varying speeds in the interlinked areas of tax reform, price reform, and enterprise reform.

40|$|For {{the first}} time since the {{enactment}} of the windfall profit tax, quarterly liability per barrel has significantly decreased. The average windfall profit tax dropped from $ 9. 94 per barrel in the se-cond quarter of 1981 to $ 8. 55 for the third quarter, a decrease of almost 14 percent. This excise tax is generally levied on the "windfall profit " generated by the phased <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> oil <b>prices.</b> The windfall profit tax base is the removal price per barrel (generally the price the oil is sold for) less the adjusted base price (a set base price adjusted by a quarterly inflation factor) and the State severance tax adjustment. The windfall profit, and therefore the windfall profit tax liability, fluctuates largely with changes in oil prices. These fluctuations have been espe-cially apparent since the full <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> oil in January 1981. For the second quarter of 1981, the removal price rose 11 percent over the last quarter of 1980, the adjusted base price remained about the same, and the tax rose 43 percent. In contrast, the removal price dropped by almost $ 2. 00 per barrel from the second to the third quarter of 1981, a result of the excess supply of crude oil. Since the adjusted base price increased at the same time, the result was a significant decrease in the profit and tax. The windfall profit tax liability is also affected by adjustments made by the withholding agent. These adjustments can result from under- or over-withhold-ing or the net income limitation.

40|$|<b>Decontrol</b> <b>of</b> the {{wellhead}} <b>price</b> <b>of</b> {{natural gas}} under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 ended the general shortage of natural gas, which {{had begun in}} the 1960 s. It also led to dislocations in gas markets because of regulatory uncertainties that created difficulties in renegotiating contracts made during the shortage period. Together, the decontrol and dislocations led {{to a decline in}} the traditional role of interstate gas pipelines as full-requirements suppliers to local distributors, who now use pipelines primarily as transporters of gas purchased independently of the pipelines. The growth in transport transactions has increased greatly the potential scope of efficient exchanges in gas markets. Achieving efficiency gains, however, requires an underlying right of access to pipelines that is non-discriminatory, exchangeable, and consistent with both existing regulation and pre-existing contractual relationships. The authors define such a right, which they call exchangeable transport entitlement (ETE). They show that ETE satisfies the criteria for efficiency gains, and they examine the practical problems of the transition that a regulatory regime incorporating ETE faces. The analysis has important implications for other industries and for the economic theory of regulation. Specifically, the analysis shows that economists must realize the importance of diverse contractual relationships in both their theoretical literature and their proposals for regulatory reform.

40|$|The {{structure}} of {{production in the}} natural gas transmission industry is estimated using the dual restricted cost function based on panel data for twenty four firms. A standard translog variable cost function with firm fixed effects is augmented with controls for capacity utilization, technical change, and shifting regulatory regimes. During {{the implementation of the}} Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA), 1978 - 1985, the industry exhibited no significant increase in productivity, largely attributable to the decline in output for the industry. Regulatory efforts to promote voluntary non-contract transmission appear to have enabled some firms to mitigate the overall industry productivity stagnation. The NGPA instituted a complex schedule of partial and gradual <b>decontrol</b> <b>of</b> natural gas <b>prices</b> at the well head. This form of deregulation costs natural gas producers over $ 100 billion in lost revenues, relative to immediate and full price deregulation. However, the transmission firms benefited by paying $ 1. 5 billion less for natural gas than they would have under total deregulation. The benefits to consumers, totaling $ 98. 7 billion, were unevenly distributed. On average, for the 1978 - 1985 period, utilities, commercial, and industrial users paid less for their gas than they would have under total decontrol and residential users paid $ 8. 6 billion more. The NGPA and Federal Regulatory Commission oversight practices allow the transmission industry to price discriminate among customers. CES,economic,research,micro,data,microdata,chief,economist...|$|R
