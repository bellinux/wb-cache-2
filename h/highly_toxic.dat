30|$|Previously, it was {{hypothesized}} that <b>highly</b> acute <b>toxic</b> compounds have little room to increase through prolonged exposure times [2]. Moreover, it can be supposed that some chemicals showing less acute toxicity may address non-lethal endpoints covered by chronic tests. The results {{of this study indicate that}} <b>highly</b> acute <b>toxic</b> compounds with L(E)C 50  < 1  mg/L have a lower probability for substantially increased ACR values. This suggests that the uncertainty of the extrapolation approach is expected to be reduced for substances with an L(E)C 50  < 1  mg/L. Nevertheless, several substances exhibiting acute L(E)C 50 values < 1  mg/L exhibit an ACR value between 10 and 100.|$|R

5|$|Amanita ocreata is <b>highly</b> <b>toxic,</b> and {{has been}} {{responsible}} for mushroom poisonings in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (A. phalloides), half a cap of which can be enough to kill a human, and other species known as destroying angels. There is some evidence it may be the most toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as a higher proportion of people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished. Dogs have also been known to consume this fungus in California with fatal results.|$|E

5|$|The venom {{is a mix}} of toxins, {{including}} neurotoxins, that paralyzes {{the prey}} so the anemone can move it to the mouth for digestion inside the gastrovascular cavity. Actinotoxins are <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> to prey species of fish and crustaceans. However, Amphiprioninae (clownfish), small banded fish in various colours, are not affected by their host anemone's sting and shelter themselves from predators among its tentacles. Several other species have similar adaptions and are also unaffected (see Symbiotic relationships). Most sea anemones are harmless to humans, but a few <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> species (notably Actinodendron arboreum, Phyllodiscus semoni and Stichodactyla spp.) have caused severe injuries and are potentially lethal.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine is a {{chemical}} element with symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen and exists as a <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions.

50|$|Toxic semen is most {{associated}} with Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies. Drosophila fruit flies exhibit toxic semen along with intra-genitalic traumatic insemination.

5|$|The phallotoxins {{consist of}} at least seven compounds, {{all of which have}} seven similar peptide rings. Although they are <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> to liver cells, phallotoxins have since been found to have little input into the {{destroying}} angel's toxicity as they are not absorbed through the gut. Furthermore, one phallotoxin, phalloidin, is also found in the edible (and sought-after) blusher (Amanita rubescens).|$|E

5|$|Venom that is toxic only to {{a certain}} taxon, or {{strongly}} toxic {{only to a}} certain taxon, {{has been found in}} a number of snakes, suggesting that these venoms have evolved via natural selection to subdue preferred prey species. Examples of this phenomenon have been found in the Mangrove snake Boiga dendrophila, which has a venom specifically toxic to birds, {{as well as in the}} genera Echis and Sistrurus, and in sea snakes. However, while several snakes possess venom that is <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> to their preferred prey species, the reverse correlation is not necessarily true: the venoms of several snakes are toxic to taxa that they do not consume in high proportions. Most snake venom, for instance, is <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> to lizards, although the proportion of lizard prey varies among snake species. This has led researchers to suggest that toxicity to a certain taxon is nearly independent of toxicity to another distantly related taxon.|$|E

50|$|An {{organophosphate}} (sometimes abbreviated OP) or {{phosphate ester}} {{is the general}} name for esters of phosphoric acid. Organophosphates are the basis of many insecticides, herbicides, and nerve agents. The United States Environmental Protection Agency lists organophosphates as very <b>highly</b> acutely <b>toxic</b> to bees, wildlife, and humans. Recent studies suggest a possible link to adverse effects in the neurobehavioral development of fetuses and children, even at very low levels of exposure. Organophosphates are widely used as solvents, plasticizers, and EP additives.|$|R

5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as <b>highly</b> <b>toxic,</b> although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E
5|$|Although zinc is an {{essential}} requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{fluorine}} is <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> {{to living}} organisms. Its effects in humans start at concentrations lower than hydrogen cyanide's 50 ppm and {{are similar to}} those of chlorine: significant irritation of the eyes and respiratory system as well as liver and kidney damage occur above 25 ppm, which is the immediately dangerous to life and health value for fluorine. Eyes and noses are seriously damaged at 100 ppm, and inhalation of 1,000 ppm fluorine will cause death in minutes, compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide.|$|E

The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms.

5|$|The {{only known}} {{clinical}} use of osmium {{appears to be}} for synovectomy in arthritic patients in Scandinavia. It involves the local administration of osmium tetroxide (OsO4), which is a <b>highly</b> <b>toxic</b> compound. The lack of reports of long-term side effects suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible, although this depends on the osmium compound administered. In 2011, osmium(VI) and osmium(II) compounds were reported to show anticancer activity in vivo, it indicated a promising future for using osmium compounds as anticancer drugs.|$|E

40|$|Katangan {{copper and}} cobalt hills in the D. R. Congo are {{isolated}} ecosystems on <b>highly</b> <b>toxics</b> substrates (> 10. 000 ppm Cu, with strongly marked gradients). As a result, those outcrops host singular vegetal communities – with {{a diversity of}} specialized metallophytes species – related to soil metals content. Recent resumption of mining activities in the area threatens those ecosystems. To allow the restoration of those communities a fine {{understanding of the relationship}} maintained with the edaphic factors is required, as well as a characterization of the intra and inter sites variation. Three outcrops have been studied {{on the basis of a}} systematic grid, following the a priori trace elements gradient. In 1 m² quadrats, a composite soil sample (0 - 15 cm depth) was taken and the cover (%) of each species of vascular plants was recorded. Soils were analyzed for pH, C, N, and bioavailables Cu, Co, Zn, Mn, Fe, K, Mg, Ca and P. The cluster analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis show that different sites present different soil conditions and vegetation. Concentrations in Cu are an important explicative factor of the flora’s variation but gradients in others edaphic parameters (pH, Mg, Mn, K, Ca) appear to be essential. However, parameters explaining the diversity of communities vary from one site to another indicating a great diversity of those ecosystems and the need to develop restoration strategies relevant for each site.
