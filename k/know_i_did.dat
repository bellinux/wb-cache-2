And then I went and I played it for [...] and I just {{basically}} told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing. And so that song specifically, you <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> everything." ...|$|E
500|$|Relations {{between the}} Olympians and the Australian Government {{remained}} tense {{after months of}} political struggle regarding the boycott. The quartet did not receive the customary congratulations from Fraser, who initially resisted complaints the next day from the media and government members at his failure to applaud the Australian victory. In a radio interview, he said [...] "I hope that circumstances do not arise {{over the next few}} years which will cause them to have very great regrets about the fact that they've gone". Fraser relented and late in the night, his office sent a telegram indirectly, through the Australian Embassy in Moscow. Fraser had ordered the Australian diplomatic mission to shun the Olympians, so the embassy staff had to pass the envelopes containing the message through the Olympic Village fence. Fraser's telegram said: [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not and do not approve of Australia being represented at these Olympic Games. I do want to say however that your performance in the relay was a truly great sporting achievement. My personal congratulations." [...] The swimmers tore up the message.|$|E
500|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} of 1747, the Prince of Wales again campaigned actively for the opposition but Pelham's party won easily. Like his father before him, the Prince entertained opposition figures at his house in Leicester Square. When the Prince of Wales died suddenly in 1751, his eldest son, Prince George, became heir apparent. The king commiserated with the Dowager Princess of Wales and wept with her. As her son would not reach the age of majority until 1756, a new British Regency Act was passed to make her regent, assisted by a council led by the Duke of Cumberland, in case of George II's death. The king also made a new will, which provided for Cumberland to be sole regent in Hanover. After {{the death of his}} daughter Louisa {{at the end of the}} year, George lamented, [...] "This has been a fatal year for my family. I lost my eldest son– but I am glad of it... Now [...] is gone. I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not love my children when they were young: I hated to have them running into my room; but now I love them as well as most fathers." ...|$|E

In {{an interview with}} Guitar World magazine in 2003, he stated: [...] "I can't speak for the , but for me drugs were {{an integral part of}} the whole thing, right from the beginning, right to the end." [...] After the band's 1973 North American tour, Page told Nick Kent: [...] "Oh, everyone went over the top a few times.

2500|$|The series {{debuted in}} an hour-long format, but {{was put on}} hiatus {{only a few weeks}} into the season. CBS had moved the series to Saturday nights, which led to falling ratings. [...] When The Twilight Zone {{returned}} in December, the episodes were half-hour shows, and generally contained only one story. [...] The series was cancelled by February, with remaining episodes being aired over the summer as hour-long multi-story episodes. [...] Season 2 only ran for 11 episodes; several of the unproduced episodes would be filmed for season 3. In regard to writing for the episode [...] "The Girl I Married", J. M. DeMatteis commented [...] "I have a feeling that the show that appears will not bear much relation to what I wrote. What I've found out is that this season—unlike last, where the script was pretty much regarded as sacrosanct—the network is really interfering a lot. [...] Regardless, I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a good job and it was a real satisfying experience." ...|$|E
