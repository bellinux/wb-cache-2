40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} rainfall variability and uncertainties on the spatial scaling structure of peak flows using the Whitewater River basin in Kansas, and Iowa River basin in Iowa as illustrations. We illustrate why considering individual hydrographs at the outlet of a basin can lead to misleading interpretations {{of the effects of}} rainfall variability. The variability of rainfall is characterized in terms of storm intensity, duration, advection velocity, zero-rain intermittency, variance and spatial correlation structure. We begin with the simple scenario of a basin receiving spatially uniform rainfall of varying intensities and durations, and advection velocities. We then use a realistic space-time rainfall field obtained from a popular rainfall model that can reproduce desired storm variability and spatial structure. We employ a recent formulation of flow velocity for a network of channels and calculate peak <b>flow</b> <b>scaling</b> exponents, which are then compared to the scaling exponent of the channel network width function maxima. The study then investigates the role of hillslope characteristics on the peak <b>flow</b> <b>scaling</b> structure. The basin response at the smaller scales is driven by the rainfall intensities (and spatial variability), while the larger scale response is dominated by the rainfall volume as the river network aggregates the variability at the smaller scales. The results obtained from simulation scenarios {{can be used to make}} rigorous interpretations of the peak <b>flow</b> <b>scaling</b> structure obtained from actual space-time model, and actual radar-rainfall events measured by the NEXRAD weather radar network. An ensemble of probable rainfall fields conditioned on the given radar-rainfall field is then generated using a radar-rainfall error model and probable rainfall generator. The statistical structure of ensemble fields is then compared with that of given radar-rainfall field to quantify the impact of radar-rainfall errors on 1) spatial characterization of the rainfall events and 2) scaling structure of the peak flows. The effect of radar-rainfall errors is to introduce spurious correlations in the radar-rainfall fields, particularly at the smaller scales. However, preliminary results indicated that the radar-rainfall errors do not significantly affect the peak <b>flow</b> <b>scaling</b> exponents...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to {{turbulent}} mixing. Various flow problems arising {{in science and technology}} are intimately connected to properties of turbulent transport. Improvements and control of mixing efficiency rely directly on the understanding of turbulence phenomena. From the mathematical point of view, turbulence is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. The convective nonlinearity in these equations induces an interaction between a wide range of <b>scales</b> in a <b>flow.</b> In additions, the dissipation term acts mainly on the smallest <b>flow</b> <b>scales,</b> characterized by the fluid viscosity. In the absence of external forces theses two terms fully dictate the dynamics of decaying turbulence.

40|$|The {{settling}} velocities of natural, synthetic, {{and industrial}} particles were measured in a grid turbulence facility using optical measurement techniques. Particle image velocimetry and 2 D particle tracking {{were used to}} measure the instantaneous velocities of the flow and the particles' trajectories simultaneously. We find that for particles examined in this study (Rep = 0. 4 - 123), settling velocity is either enhanced or unchanged relative to stagnant flow for the range of investigated turbulence conditions. The smallest particles' normalized settling velocities exhibited the most consistent trends when plotted versus the Kolmogorov-based Stokes numbers suggesting that the dissipative scales influence their dynamics. In contrast, the mid-sized particles were better characterized with a Stokes number based on the integral time scale. The largest particles were largely unaffected by the flow conditions. Using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), the <b>flow</b> pattern <b>scales</b> are compared to particle trajectory curvature to complement results obtained through dimensional analysis using Stokes numbers. The smallest particles are found to have trajectories with curvatures of similar scale as the small <b>flow</b> <b>scales</b> (higher POD modes) whilst mid-sized particle trajectories had curvatures that were similar to the larger flow patterns (lower POD modes). The curvature trajectories of the largest particles did not correspond to any particular <b>flow</b> pattern <b>scale</b> suggesting that their trajectories were more random.

40|$|Abstract Understanding {{the spatial}} {{structure}} of daily streamflow {{is essential for}} managing freshwater resources, especially in poorly gaged regions. Spatial scaling assumptions are common in flood frequency prediction (e. g., index-flood method) and the prediction of continuous streamflow at ungaged sites (e. g. drainage-area ratio), with simple scaling by drainage area being the most common assumption. In this study, scaling analyses of daily streamflow from 173 streamgages in the southeastern United States resulted in three important findings. First, the use of only positive integer moment orders, as {{has been done in}} most previous studies, captures only the probabilistic and spatial <b>scaling</b> behavior of <b>flows</b> above an exceedance probability near the median; negative moment orders (inverse moments) are needed for lower streamflows. Second, assessing scaling by using drainage area alone is shown to result in a high degree of omitted-variable bias, masking the true spatial scaling behavior. Multiple regression is shown to mitigate this bias, controlling for regional heterogeneity of basin attributes, especially those correlated with drainage area. Previous univariate scaling analyses have neglected the scaling of low-flow events and may have produced biased estimates of the spatial scaling exponent. Third, the multiple regression results show that mean <b>flows</b> <b>scale</b> with an exponent of one, low <b>flows</b> <b>scale</b> with spatial scaling expo-nents greater than one, and high <b>flows</b> <b>scale</b> with exponents less than one. The relationship between scal-ing exponents and exceedance probabilities may be a fundamental signature of regional streamflow. This signature may improve our understanding of the physical processes generating streamflow at different exceedance probabilities. 1...|$|R

40|$|From a {{mathematical}} perspective, radiation hydrodynamics {{can be thought}} of as a system of hyperbolic balance laws with dual multiscale behavior (multiscale behavior associated with the hyperbolic wave speeds as well as multiscale behavior associated with source term relaxation). With this outlook in mind, this paper presents a hybrid Godunov method for one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics that is uniformly well behaved from the photon free streaming (hyperbolic) limit through the weak equilibrium diffusion (parabolic) limit and to the strong equilibrium diffusion (hyperbolic) limit. Moreover, one finds that the technique preserves certain asymptotic limits. The method incorporates a backward Euler upwinding scheme for the radiation energy density and flux as well as a modified Godunov scheme for the material density, momentum density, and energy density. The backward Euler upwinding scheme is first-order accurate and uses an implicit HLLE flux function to temporally advance the radiation components according to the material <b>flow</b> <b>scale.</b> The modified Godunov scheme is second-order accurate and directly couples stiff source term effects to the hyperbolic structure of the system of balance laws. This Godunov technique is composed of a predictor step that is based on Duhamel's principle and a corrector step that is based on Picard iteration. The Godunov scheme is explicit on the material <b>flow</b> <b>scale</b> but is unsplit and fully couples matter and radiation without invoking a diffusion-type approximation for radiation hydrodynamics. This technique derives from earlier work by Miniati & Colella 2007. Numerical tests demonstrate that the method is stable, robust, and accurate across various parameter regimes.
