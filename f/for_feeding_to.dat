5|$|The {{presence}} of lions at the Tower of London was intermittent, being restocked when a monarch or his consort, such as Margaret of Anjou {{the wife of}} Henry VI, either sought or were given animals. Records indicate they were kept in poor conditions there in the seventeenth century, in contrast to more open conditions in Florence at the time. The menagerie was {{open to the public}} by the eighteenth century; admission was a sum of three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>to</b> the lions. A rival menagerie at the Exeter Exchange also exhibited lions until the early nineteenth century. The Tower menagerie was closed down by William IV, and animals transferred to the London Zoo, which opened its gates to the public on 27 April 1828.|$|E

Five floor pen studies on turkeys for fattening were provided by the applicant. In four studies, growth and <b>feed</b> <b>to</b> gain ratio was improved, after four weeks, by 60 mg Mo-Na from Coxidin® kg- 1 complete feedingstuff. In the following four-week period, comparable effects could be observed for growth rate, but not <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> <b>to</b> gain ratio. Clinical endpoints, indicative for coccidiosis control, were with one exception (intestinal lesion score seven days after inoculation in two studies) not influenced. Coccidiosis in turkey is commonly milder than in chicken, this may contribute to explaining the lack of conclusive clinical data in these studies. Cumulative data (after 84 days for female and 112 days for male turkeys) showed positive effects for 60 mg Mo-Na from Coxidin ® kg- 1 complete feedingstuff <b>for</b> growth and <b>feed</b> <b>to</b> gain ratio in one study, <b>for</b> <b>feed</b> <b>to</b> gain ratio and reduced mortality in another study, and reduced mortality alone in a third study.

25|$|The FDA {{has been}} criticised for {{allowing}} {{the use of}} recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) in dairy cows. rBGH-treated cows secrete higher levels of {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) in their milk than do untreated cows. IGF-1 signalling is thought {{to play a role in}} sustaining the growth of some tumors, although there is little or no evidence that exogenously absorbed IGF could promote tumor growth. The FDA approved rBGH for use in dairy cows in 1993, after concluding that humans drinking such milk were unlikely to absorb biologically significant quantities of bovine IGF-1. A 1999 report of the European Commission Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health noted that scientific questions persist regarding the theoretical health risks of milk from rBGH-treated cows, particularly <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>to</b> infants. Since 1993, all EU countries have maintained a ban on rBGH use in dairy cattle.|$|E

The Harnessing Opportunities for Productivity Enhancement of Sorghum and Millets in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian-Subcontinent (HOPE) project, for example, is increasing yields of finger millet in Tanzania by encouraging farmers to grow improved varieties. Finger millet is very high in calcium, rich in iron and fiber, and has a better energy content than other cereals. These characteristics make it ideal <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>to</b> infants and the elderly.|$|E

40|$|In this study, zoo visitor {{response}} <b>to</b> live prey <b>feeding</b> and jaguar response <b>to</b> {{dead fish}} <b>feeding</b> were analyzed. Four hundred visitors at Zoo Atlanta and four hundred visitors at Palm Beach Zoo {{were asked about}} their attitudes toward <b>feeding</b> live prey <b>to</b> zoo carnivores. Agreement rates {{were found to be}} high. Agreement rates at Zoo Atlanta and Palm Beach Zoo were both significantly higher <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> live fish <b>to</b> penguins than at Edinburgh Zoo as reported in Ings et al. (1997). Zoo Atlanta also had a higher agreement rate <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> live rabbits <b>to</b> cheetahs in view than Edinburgh Zoo. Both Zoo Atlanta and Palm Beach Zoo had lower agreement rates <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> live insects <b>to</b> lizards out of view than Edinburgh Zoo. Agreement rates for visitors at Palm Beach Zoo that saw a dead fish to jaguar introduction did not differ significantly from visitors that had not seen the introduction. However, at both US Zoos, agreement rate was higher for visitors that had seen a live prey introduction at a zoo or aquarium in the past. Agreement rate was significantly greater <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> live fish <b>to</b> jaguars, mice to hawks, and rabbits to cheetahs in view. For Palm Beach Zoo agreement rate was also higher <b>for</b> <b>feeding</b> live rabbits <b>to</b> cheetahs out of view. Stay time did not differ significantly between visitors at Palm Beach Zoo that saw and did not see a dead fish to jaguar introduction. Jaguar activity level, behavioral diversity, fecal corticoids, visibility, and percent time spent in water did not significantly differ between fish introduction and baseline. M. S.
