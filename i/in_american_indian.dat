West solicited Hillcourt's thoughts on Scouting in the U.S. Hillcourt later sent West an 18-page memo detailing issues {{with the lack of}} patrol structure and leadership. He recommended that the BSA write a handbook for patrol leaders, and that it needed to be written by someone who had been both a patrol leader and a Scoutmaster. West hired Hillcourt as a writer and editor and was later persuaded to commission Hillcourt to write the first Handbook for Patrol Leaders which was published in 1929.|$|E

40|$|Introduction <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> youths smoke {{cigarettes}} at high rates, yet few smoking-cessation {{programs have been}} developed for them. The objective of this study, conducted during 2003 and 2004, was to determine the preliminary quit and reduction outcomes of the American Lung Association’s newly adapted <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Not On Tobacco (N-O-T) program. Methods Seventy-four <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> youths aged 14 to 19 years in North Carolina were enrolled <b>in</b> the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> N-O-T program or a brief 15 -minute intervention. Quit and reduction rates were compared 3 months after baseline using compliant subsamples and intention-to-treat analyses. Results Among males <b>in</b> the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> N-O-T program, between 18 % (intention-to-treat) and 29 % (compliant subsample) quit smoking. Six males (28. 6 %) <b>in</b> the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> N-O-T program reported quitting smoking; one male (14. 3 %) in the brief intervention reported quitting. No females in either group quit smoking. More females <b>in</b> the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> N-O-T program reduced smoking than females in the brief intervention. Conclusion These pilot results suggest that the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> N-O-T program offers a useful and feasible cessation option for <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> youths <b>in</b> North Carolina. Program modifications are necessary to improve outcomes for <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> females, and recruitment issues require in-depth study.

25|$|With {{help from}} the State of Louisiana, the tribe filed a lawsuit for the title to the artifacts, which {{has become known as}} the Tunica Treasure.

25|$|Chief Justice John Marshall {{laid out}} in this opinion that the {{relationship}} between the Indian Nations and the United States is that of nations. He reasoned that the United States, in the character of the federal government, inherited the rights of Great Britain as they were held by that nation. Those rights, he stated, include the sole right to deal with the Indian nations in North America, to the exclusion of any other European power. This did not include the rights of possession to their land or political dominion over their laws. He acknowledged that the exercise of conquest and purchase can give political dominion, but those {{are in the hands of}} the federal government, and individual states had no authority <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> affairs.

25|$|Drums {{are highly}} {{influential}} <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums {{and how to}} play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two to three feet in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who sit around them in a circle. For smaller single-sided hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois water drum is a small cup-shaped wooden vessel, with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the wetness and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the water drum is played over time. The Yaqui type of water drum is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in a tub of water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of the gourd is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.|$|E

50|$|<b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> of {{all ages}} and sexes have a {{generally}} high prevalence of obesity. Researchers have identified that issue has only come to light in the past few generations and much of it is linked to many individuals having a lack of healthy food options and an increased amount of time spent being sedentary. The overall health of Native Americans is considerably worse than the general population. Since the early 1950s, the rate of mortality from infectious disease has decreased substantially. But mortality related to behavioral or lifestyle factors has increased, and chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and cancer are among the leading causes of death in adults. Chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus in particular, are strong indicators of an increasing prevalence of obesity <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indians.</b> Because the prevalence rates of obesity are higher <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indians,</b> {{studies have shown that the}} population will suffer from greater health complications later on in life as well.|$|R

25|$|On February 21, 1928, The Problem of Indian Administration, an 872-page {{document}} {{known as}} the Meriam Report, for Lewis Meriam, its technical director, was published by Johns Hopkins Press. The report received wide acclaim as the most comprehensive survey of American Indians ever conducted. McKenzie's influence as Specialist in Existing Material Related to Indians was significant, and along with Henry Roe Cloud as Indian Advisor, and Technical Director Lewis Meriam, served on all the committees and co-authored the final report. The Meriam Report revealed the failures of federal Indian policies and how they had contributed to severe problems with Indian education, health, and poverty. The Report marked an ideological shift <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> policy, calling for a restoration of self-government and communal land to tribes and a reversal of long-standing U.S. government laws to eliminate Indian reservations. Acting upon the emergency recommendations of the Meriam Report, President Herbert Hoover directed Commissioner Charles J. Rhoads of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to prepare a reform package for improved medical facilities, adequate food and clothing and the closure of unpopular reservation boarding schools. On June 18, 1934, within five years of the Meriam Report, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Indian Reorganization Act, restoring self-government and communal land to tribes and reversing long-standing U.S. government laws to eliminate Indian reservations. Popularly {{known as the}} Indian New Deal, the initiative was administered by progressive John Collier, Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945.|$|E
