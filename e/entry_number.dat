5|$|Michaels {{then began}} a rivalry with Chris Jericho, after Jericho {{claimed that he}} was the next Shawn Michaels. On January 13, 2003, after Jericho won a battle royal to select his <b>entry</b> <b>number</b> for the Royal Rumble, {{choosing}} number two in order to start the match with Michaels, who had already been named number one. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho, with the help of Christian, eliminated Michaels. Michaels defeated Jericho at WrestleMania XIX. Despite this, Michaels was low-blowed after hugging with Chris Jericho. On the final episode of Raw of 2003, Michaels would defeat Triple H after a Sweet Chin Music for the World Heavyweight title in his hometown of San Antonio, Texas with Eric Bischoff as the special guest referee (Earl Hebner originally refereed the match, only to be knocked out by Triple H {{in the middle of the}} match). However, Bischoff reversed the decision due to both men's shoulders being on the mat. Angered by this, Michaels attacked Ric Flair and Bischoff. Because of Michaels putting his hands on Bischoff, Bischoff then fired him. However, Michaels would be rehired by Steve Austin.|$|E
25|$|Austin's next {{definitive}} {{chance to}} exact revenge on Mr. McMahon {{came during the}} 1999 Royal Rumble match. On Raw Is War, McMahon drew Austin's <b>entry</b> <b>number</b> with the obvious intention of screwing him over. Austin drew <b>entry</b> <b>number</b> one, while McMahon drew number two thanks to WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels. During the Royal Rumble match, McMahon {{slipped out of the}} ring and into the crowd as Austin chased him down. It {{turned out to be a}} trap as McMahon led Austin into the lobby restroom where he was ambushed by members of The Corporation. Austin was injured and taken away in an ambulance. With Austin gone and not in the Rumble match, McMahon joined the announce table in calling the match. Later on, however, Austin returned in an ambulance and re-entered the Royal Rumble, delivering a Stone Cold Stunner to Big Boss Man and eliminating him. With the assistance of The Corporation and a last minute interference from The Rock, Austin was eliminated by McMahon himself, who won the 1999 Royal Rumble.|$|E
25|$|Amon won the {{pre-season}} Silverstone International Trophy, {{but once}} the F1 season began he found himself prevented from converting good qualifying positions into good results. He qualified second behind Stewart's Tyrrell-March for the season-opening South African Grand Prix only for his own March to overheat within fourteen laps. Amon then qualified sixth for the Spanish Grand Prix only for his March's Ford-Cosworth DFV engine to expire within ten laps. He qualified and ran second in the 1970 Monaco Grand Prix until his suspension failed twenty laps from the finish. This was the race where Amon refused to drive unless his <b>entry</b> <b>number</b> was changed from 18 – the number under which his then team-mate Lorenzo Bandini had crashed and died in Monaco – to 28.|$|E

25|$|On January 13, 2003, Jericho won an over-the-top-rope {{challenge}} against Kane, Van Dam, and Batista {{to select}} his <b>entry</b> <b>number</b> for the Royal Rumble match. He chose number two {{in order to}} start the match with Shawn Michaels, who had challenged him to prove Jericho's claims that he was better than Michaels. After Michaels' entrance, Jericho entered as the second participant. Christian, in Jericho's attire, appeared while the real Jericho attacked Shawn from behind. He eliminated Michaels shortly afterward, but Michaels got his revenge later in the match by causing Test to eliminate Jericho. Jericho spent the most time of any other wrestler in that same Royal Rumble. Jericho simultaneously feuded with Test, Michaels, and Jeff Hardy. Jericho and Michaels fought again at WrestleMania XIX, which Michaels won. Jericho, however, attacked Michaels with a low blow after the match following an embrace.|$|E
500|$|Wolf 359 {{first came}} to the {{attention}} of astronomers because of the relatively high rate of [...] motion against the background, known as the proper motion. A high rate of proper motion can indicate that a star is located nearby, as more distant stars must move at higher velocities in order to achieve the same rate of angular travel across the celestial sphere. The proper motion of Wolf 359 was first measured in 1917 by German astronomer Max Wolf, with the aid of astrophotography. In 1919 he published a catalog of over one thousand stars with high proper motions, including this one, that are still identified by his name. He listed this star as <b>entry</b> <b>number</b> 359, and the star has since been referred to as Wolf 359 in reference to Max Wolf's catalogue.|$|E

2500|$|Kiki Dee {{became the}} first white British singer to sign with Motown in the US, and {{released}} one album, Great Expectations (1970), and two singles [...] "The Day Will Come Between Sunday and Monday" [...] (1970) and [...] "Love Makes The World Go Round" [...] (1971), the latter giving her first ever chart <b>entry</b> (<b>number</b> 87 on the US Chart). She soon left the company and signed with Elton John's The Rocket Record Company, and in 1976 had her biggest and best-known hit, [...] "Don't Go Breaking My Heart", a disco duet with John.

2500|$|For example, {{consider}} the character 信 xìn, meaning [...] "truth", [...] "faith", [...] "sincerity", and [...] "trust". [...] Its radical is 亻 rén [...] "human" [...] (a compressed form of 人) {{and there are}} seven additional strokes in the remaining portion (言 yán, [...] "speech"). [...] To look up this character in a dictionary, one finds the radical for [...] "human" [...] {{in the part of}} dictionary that indexes radicals. The various radicals will be organized by the number of strokes they themselves contain. 人 and its compressed version 亻 contain only two strokes, so it will be near the beginning of the list. Locating it, one can see the page for the index on that radical, and one then normally passes through the lists of characters with one additional stroke, two additional strokes, etc. until one reaches the entries with seven additional strokes. If the chosen radical matches the radical used by the dictionary compiler (which can be difficult to guarantee for more complicated characters), and if both the user and the dictionary compiler count strokes the same way (also often a problem with characters that the user is unfamiliar with), the entry will be in that list, and will appear next to an <b>entry</b> <b>number</b> or a page number where the full dictionary entry for that character can be found.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{destruction}} by fire {{of the old}} Houses of Parliament on 16 October 1834, a competition was held to find a suitable design, for which there were 97 entries. Barry's <b>entry,</b> <b>number</b> 64, for which Pugin helped prepare the competition drawings, won the commission in January 1836 to design the new Palace of Westminster. His collaboration with Pugin (who designed furniture, stained glass, sculpture, wallpaper, decorative floor tiles, mosaic work etc.) was not renewed until June 1844 and continued until Pugin's mental breakdown and death in 1852. The Tudor Gothic architectural style was chosen to complement the Henry VII Lady Chapel opposite. The design had to incorporate {{those parts of the}} building that escaped destruction, most notably Westminster Hall, the adjoining double storey cloisters of St Stephen's court and the crypt of St Stephen's Chapel. Barry's design was parallel to the River Thames, but the surviving buildings are at a slight angle to the river, thus Barry had to incorporate this awkward difference in axis into the design. Although the design included most of the elements of the finished building, including the two towers {{at either end of the}} building, it would undergo significant redesign. [...] The winning design was only about 650 feet in length about two-thirds the size of the finished building. The central lobby and tower were later additions as were the extensive royal suite at the southern end of the building. The amended design on which construction commenced was approximately the same size as the finished building, although both the Victoria Tower and Clock Tower were considerably taller in the finished building and the Central Tower was not yet part of the design.|$|E
