We report the influence of process parameters on yields and carbon distribution between products: temperature (563 - 608 K), holding time (0 - 240 min), mass fraction of dry biomass in the slurry (0. 05 - 0. 29), and initial pH (3. 1 - 12. 8) by adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Depending on the experiments, the bio-oil accounts for at least 24 % mass fraction of the initial dry biomass, while char yields ranges from 24 to 40 %. A temperature of 583 K enhances the bio-oil yield, up to 30 %, while holding time {{does not have a}} significant influence on the results. Increasing biomass concentrations decreases bio-oil yields from 29 % to 24 %. Adding sodium hydroxide decreases the char yield from 35 % at pH = 3. 1 (without NaOH) to 24 % at pH = 12. 8. It also increases the bio-oil yield and carbon transfer to the aqueous phase. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that a 43 % mass fraction of the bio-oil boils in the medium naphtha petroleum fraction range. The bio-oil is highly acidic and unsaturated, and its dynamic viscosity is high (1. 7 Pa sat 298 K), underlining the need for further upgrading before any use for fuel applications...|$|R
40|$|Estimating the {{quantity}} and physicochemical characterization of food waste is necessary to optimize composting process. A survey was conducted to estimate {{the amount of food}} waste generated by commercial (n= 10) and household (n= 50) sectors in Bandar Baru Bangi. The presence of cooked rice residue, meat based residue, fish based <b>residue,</b> vegetable and <b>fruit</b> <b>residue</b> and whether the food waste was in wet condition were also examined. Physicochemical characteristics of the food waste was also analysed. About 11. 41 MT of food waste was generated daily in Bandar Baru Bangi. From the total, household sector contributed 67. 3 % whereas commercial sector contributed another 32. 7 %. Compared to household sector, food waste in wet condition was found more frequently (p< 0. 05) in the commercial sector. Rice residue was the most frequent food waste component of household and the commercial sector. Physicochemical analysis showed that pH value, ash, organic matter, organic carbon, nitrogen and crude fat contents as well as C/N ratio were found significantly different (p< 0. 05) among food waste generated on different days. Food waste was acidic (pH 4. 82 - 5. 17), contained high moisture (65. 9 – 69. 5 %) and crude fat content (13. 1 – 20. 2 %) but low in nitrogen content (0. 63 – 0. 85 %). Nevertheless, the C/N ratio was still within an appropriate range (20 - 25) for effective composting. Hence, if composting process is introduced, the food waste {{has the potential to be}} converted into compost...|$|R

40|$|Bromelain, {{the enzyme}} found in pineapple, hydrolyzes proteins' peptide bonds, has several {{applications}} in the food industry and in medicine. Temperature and pH conditions for highest activity with casein as substrate were investigated from the bromelain recovered from industrialized pineapple ('pérola' variety) <b>fruit</b> <b>residues.</b> Extract was obtained by grinding fruit rind and its internal stem. The activity was expressed in mmol tyrosine L - 1 min. - 1 by absorbance at 280 nm of aromatic amino acids produced in casein hydrolysis. Assays were undertaken in duplicate for two enzyme/substrate with ratios: 1 / 25 and 1 / 125 (mass). Eight-pointed experimental design was undertaken with central value for pH at 7. 0 and for temperature at 35 °C. Experimental results were processed by MINITAB 15 (Minitab Inc) software which provided model's equations and surface responses. Equations were mathematically processed by differential calculus producing graphs which exhibit the best activities according to temperatures. Loss of enzyme activity was reported with temperature increase at 1 / 25 ratio, due to a higher free enzyme, when compared to 1 / 125 ratio...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between phenolic content, antioxidant and antiamylolytic activities {{was investigated in}} Rhizopus oligosporus-mediated solid-state bioprocessing of pineapple and guava residues. Two different treatments of <b>fruit</b> <b>residues</b> mixed with soy flour (5 g of soy flour and 5 g of fruit residue; 1 g of soy flour and 9 g of fruit residue) were inoculated and incubated at 22 ºC. Phenol rich extracts (non-concentrated and concentrated 10 -fold by boiling) from day 2 and 10 were tested {{for their ability to}} inhibit alpha-amylase. In order to correlate the enzymatic inhibition with phenolic-linked antioxidant activity of the extracts, samples were evaluated for total phenolic content and free radical scavenging. Alpha-amylase inhibition was observed for all extracts, concentrated or not, with values ranging from 10. 91 % to 100 % (complete inhibition). A direct correlation between the total phenolic content or the free radical scavenging activity and alpha-amylase inhibition was not found, demonstrating that such an inhibition could be caused by the presence of specific compounds, phenolic or not, rather than by the actual concentration of overall fruit phenolics...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the pulp and the residue pulp of blackberry (Rubus spp), cultivar Tupy, produced in organic system. The concentrations of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TTA), TSS/TTA and vitamin C were analysed. The results of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins ranged from 41. 94 to 91. 23 and from 103. 00 to 150. 32 mg/ 100 g, respectively. For both samples SST resulted in 8. 60, 8. 00 and 7. 85 &deg;Brix <b>fruit,</b> pulp and <b>residue</b> pulp respectively. ATT ranged from 0. 286 to 0. 315 g/citric acid L, and for whole <b>fruit</b> and pulp <b>residue,</b> respectively. The content of vitamin C was lower for the residue pulp analysis. The values of TSS and TTA did not differ significantly by Tukey test (p&gt; 0. 05). From these results we can make the inference that the residue pulp of blackberry cv. Tupy, produced in an organic system, has the amount of anthocyanins and compounds that can be used by the industry as a source for food enrichment...|$|R
40|$|EPA has {{assessed}} {{the risks of}} fenamiphos and prepared an Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision (IRED) document for this organophosphate (OP) pesticide. The IRED identifies risk mitigation measures needed to reduce risk, as well as data needed to better characterize risks. The sole registrant, Bayer Corporation, has requested voluntary cancellation of all existing fenamiphos registrations rather than committing to develop additional data. Used on variety of vegetables and <b>fruits,</b> fenamiphos <b>residues</b> in food do not pose risk concerns. However, exposure to drinking water sources from shallow water tables (less than 50 feet deep) and extremely vulnerable soils do pose risk concerns.

40|$|The {{application}} of edible coatings obtainable from alternative biodegradable materials has gained attention as a promising treatment {{to prolong the}} shelf-life of fresh-cut vegetables. Thus, this work aimed to develop a biodegradable coating based on <b>fruit</b> and vegetable <b>residues</b> flour. Immersion coating strategy was studied {{on the quality of}} minimally fresh-cut carrots during refrigeration storage by means of weight loss, color variation, pH, titratable acidity and soluble solids content. Better performance was obtained for coated carrots, which exhibited a tendency to have lower whiteness index than uncoated counterparts and enhanced overall quality. Despite a drop in color saturation expressed by chroma values (varying from 59 to 46) was observed, color index presented a positive value for all samples (varying from 13 to 15) indicating orange color preservation throughout storage. Although color parameter was influenced by coating treatment, minor modifications occur over storage concerning weight loss, pH, titratable acidity and soluble content. Results obtained demonstrated the potential of the <b>fruit</b> and vegetable <b>residues</b> flour for edible coatings formulation. Practical application on minimally processed carrots supported its suitability to be used as an alternative coating material and constitute a motivating route to evaluate and optimize this alternative preservation technique...|$|R
