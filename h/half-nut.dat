40|$|OBJECTIVE—Fat intake, {{especially}} monounsaturated {{fatty acid}} (MUFA), has been liberalized in diabetic diets to preserve HDL cholesterol and improve glycemic control, yet the exact sources have not been clearly defined. Therefore, we assessed the effect of mixed nut consumption {{as a source of}} vegetable fat on serum lipids and HbA 1 c in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—A total of 117 type 2 diabetic subjects were randomized to one of three treatments for 3 months. Supplements were provided at 475 kcal per 2, 000 -kcal diet as mixed nuts (75 g/day), muffins, or half portions of both. The primary outcome was change in HbA 1 c. RESULTS—The relative increase in MUFAs was 8. 7 % energy on the full-nut dose compared with muffins. Using an intention-to-treat analysis (n = 117), full-nut dose (mean intake 73 g/day) reduced HbA 1 c (20. 21 % absolute HbA 1 c units, 95 % CI 20. 30 to 20. 11, P, 0. 001) with no change after <b>half-nut</b> dose or muffin. Full-nut dose was significantly different from <b>half-nut</b> dose (P = 0. 004) and muffin (P = 0. 001), but no difference was seen between <b>half-nut</b> dose and muffins. LDL cholesterol also decreased significantly after full-nut dose compared with muffin. The LDL cholesterol reduction after <b>half-nut</b> dose was intermediate and not significantly differen...|$|E
