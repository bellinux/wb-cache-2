25|$|In {{the earlier}} stage of rib vaulting, the arched ribs {{consisted}} of independent or separate voussoirs {{down to the}} springing; the difficulty, however, of working the ribs separately led to two other important changes: (1) {{the lower part of}} the transverse diagonal and wall ribs were all worked out of one stone; and (2) the lower horizontal, constituting what is known as the tas-de-charge or solid springer. The tas-de-charge, or solid springer, had two advantages: (1) it enabled the stone courses to run straight through the wall, so as to bond the whole together much better; and (2) it lessened the span of the vault, which then required a centering of smaller dimensions. As soon as the ribs were completed, the web or stone shell of the vault was laid on them. In some English work each course of stone was of uniform height from one side to the other; but, as the <b>diagonal</b> <b>rib</b> was longer than either the transverse or wall rib, the courses dipped towards the former, and at the apex of the vault were cut to fit one another. In the early English Gothic period, in consequence of the great span of the vault and the very slight rise or curvature of the web, it was thought better to simplify the construction of the web by introducing intermediate ribs between the wall rib and the <b>diagonal</b> <b>rib</b> and between the diagonal and the transverse ribs; and in order to meet the thrust of these intermediate ribs a ridge rib was required, and the prolongation of this rib to the wall rib hid the junction of the web at the summit, which was not always very sightly, and constituted the ridge rib. In France, on the other hand, the web courses were always laid horizontally, and they are therefore of unequal height, increasing towards the <b>diagonal</b> <b>rib.</b> Each course also was given a slight rise in the centre, so as to increase its strength; this enabled the French masons to dispense with the intermediate rib, which was not introduced by them till the 15th century, and then more as a decorative than a constructive feature, as the domical form given to the French web rendered unnecessary the ridge rib, which, with some few exceptions, exists only in England. In both English and French vaulting centering was rarely required for the building of the web, a template (Fr. cerce) being employed to support the stones of each ring until it was complete. In Italy, Germany and Spain the French method of building the web was adopted, with horizontal courses and a domical form. Sometimes, in the case of comparatively narrow compartments, and more especially in clerestories, the wall rib was stilted, and this caused a peculiar twisting of the web, where the springing of the wall rib is at K: to these twisted surfaces the term ploughshare vaulting is given.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples of {{the introduction of the}} intermediate rib is found in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, and there the ridge rib is not carried to the wall rib. It was soon found, however, that the construction of the web was much facilitated by additional ribs, and consequently there was a tendency to increase their number, so that in the nave of Exeter Cathedral three intermediate ribs were provided between the wall rib and the <b>diagonal</b> <b>rib.</b> In order to mask the junction of the various ribs, their intersections were ornamented with richly carved bosses, and this practice increased on the introduction of another short rib, known as the lierne, a term in France given to the ridge rib. Lierne ribs are short ribs crossing between the main ribs, and were employed chiefly as decorative features, as, for instance, in the Liebfrauenkirche (1482) of Mühlacker, Germany. One of the best examples of Lierne ribs exists in the vault of the oriel window of Crosby Hall, London. The tendency {{to increase the number of}} ribs led to singular results in some cases, as in the choir of Gloucester Cathedral, where the ordinary diagonal ribs become mere ornamental mouldings on the surface of an intersected pointed barrel vault, and again in the cloisters, where the introduction of the fan vault, forming a concave-sided conoid, returned to the principles of the Roman geometrical vault. This is further shown in the construction of these fan vaults, for although in {{the earliest}} examples each of the ribs above the tas-de-charge was an independent feature, eventually it was found easier to carve them and the web out of the solid stone, so that the rib and web were purely decorative and had no constructional or independent functions.|$|E

The transverse ribs are pointed in the Gothic manner, and thus rise to the full height of the wider <b>diagonal</b> <b>ribs.</b> Each group of ribs springs from a group of clustered columns. Externally the columns and vault are supported by stout buttresses of semi-circular plan. Unlike the Lower Church, the transepts also have ribbed vaulting.|$|R

50|$|The {{exterior}} of the cathedral is of neo-Gothic influence with pointed arch windows decorated with stained glass, buress and pinnacles while the interior {{is influenced by the}} Gothic style with its ceiling that looks like a <b>diagonal</b> <b>rib</b> vault. Grey stones were used to build the outside. The main vault is 28 m (90 ft) high and the interior one is 18 m (60 ft) high. Three bells, weighing 1,641 kg in total were installed in 1891. The cathedral is famous for its Casavant Frères organ.|$|E
5000|$|The wing {{was very}} similar in plan {{to that of the}} Zögling, {{rectangular}} apart from clipped aileron tips, though it had a 1 m greater span. It was built around two double-T-section spars with <b>diagonal</b> <b>rib</b> reinforcements and mounted on top of the upper girder without dihedral. The wire braced version had steel flying wires from the cabane and from the lower fuselage; the strutted model had faired parallel lift struts on each side from the lower fuselage to the wing. [...] The strutted Allievo Pavullo was 19 kg heavier but more robust and better suited to winch launching; mostly it was preferred by clubs.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} {{employed in}} England was to stilt the transverse ribs, maintaining a horizontal central {{line to the}} roof {{like that of a}} barrel vault. The <b>diagonal</b> <b>ribs</b> could also be depressed, a solution used on the sexpartite vaults at both the Saint-Étienne, (Abbaye-aux-Hommes) and Sainte-Trinité, (Abbaye-les-Dames) at Caen, France, in the late 11th and early 12th centuries.|$|R
25|$|Ribbed vaults {{came into}} general {{use in the}} 12th century. In ribbed vaults, not only are there ribs {{spanning}} the vaulted area transversely, but each vaulted bay has <b>diagonal</b> <b>ribs,</b> following the same course as the groins in a groin vault.

50|$|The {{problem was}} {{ultimately}} solved by {{the introduction of}} the pointed arch for the transverse and wall ribs - the pointed arch had long been known and employed, on account of its much greater strength and of the lessened thrust it exerted on the walls. When employed for the ribs of a vault, however narrow the span might be, by adopting a pointed arch, its summit could be made to range in height with the <b>diagonal</b> <b>rib.</b> Moreover, when utilized for the ribs of the annular vault, as in the aisle round the apsidal termination of the choir, it was not necessary that the half ribs on the outer side should be in the same plane as those of the inner side; for when the opposite ribs met in the centre of the annular vault, the thrust was equally transmitted from one to the other, and being already a broken arch the change of its direction was not noticeable.|$|E

25|$|Because Romanesque arches {{are nearly}} always semi-circular, the {{structural}} and design problem {{inherent in the}} ribbed vault is that the diagonal span is larger and therefore higher than the transverse span.

50|$|Compound pier or Cluster pier is the {{architectural}} term {{given to a}} clustered column or pier which consists of a centre mass or newel, to which engaged or semi-detached shafts have been attached, in order to perform (or to suggest the performance of) certain definite structural objects, such as to carry arches of additional orders, or to support the transverse or <b>diagonal</b> <b>ribs</b> of a vault, or the tie-beam of an important roof.

The wing also is constructed with a trailing edge tape that extends across the complete wing's span. This tape reduces canopy oscillations and stiffens the wing in flight.

To meet this, at first the transverse and wall ribs were stilted, or the upper part of their arches was raised, as in the Abbaye-aux-Hommes at Caen, and the Abbey of Lessay, in Normandy.|$|R
