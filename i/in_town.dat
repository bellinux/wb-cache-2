5|$|On July 31, the Tanana River {{began to}} {{overflow}} its banks in Nenana. Water flooded the rails of the Alaska Railroad <b>in</b> <b>town,</b> caused an evacuation of the town's clinic, and flooded low-lying areas throughout the town. By August 1, {{the entire town}} was at least partially flooded, with most basements and other low-lying areas being completely filled by floodwater. The flooding of the Alaska Railroad track <b>in</b> <b>town</b> forced a halt to all passenger and freight operations between Anchorage and Fairbanks, effectively cutting off Fairbanks from rail traffic.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the pattern of}} cross-sectional house price appreciation in the Boston metropolitan area from 1982 to 1994. The empirical {{results are consistent with}} many of the predictions of a standard urban model <b>in</b> which <b>towns</b> have a fixed set of locational attributes and amenities. In particular, the evidence suggests that house prices <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> with a large share of residents working in the manufacturing sector in 1980 grew less quickly in the ensuing years when aggregate manufacturing employment fell. As baby boomers moved into middle age, house values appreciated faster <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> with a larger initial percentage of middle-aged residents. Housing values rose more slowly <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> that allowed additional construction, and values rose faster <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> closer to Boston. Finally, as fewer families had children who attended public schools statewide, the price premium associated with housing <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> with good schools fell. All of these findings support the view that town amenities and public services are not easily replicated or quickly adaptable to shifts in demand, even within a metropolitan area. ...|$|R
40|$|During the {{breeding}} season of 1998, {{the experiment was}} conducted on {{the breeding}} density of Common magpie Pica pica, western jackdaw Corvus monedula and hooded crow Corvus cornix <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> <b>in</b> north-eastern Slovenia. <b>In</b> each <b>town</b> I randomly selected plots. They measured 99 ha in Celje, 65. 5 ha and 52. 3 ha in Maribor, 46. 0 ha in Ptuj, 73. 4 in Slovenska Bistrica, 11. 4 ha in Slovenske Konjice and 96 ha in žalec. The most common species was common magpie which was present <b>in</b> all seven <b>towns</b> and the rarest western jackdaw which bred only <b>in</b> two <b>towns.</b> Common magpie density <b>in</b> Slovenian <b>towns</b> was approximately the same as <b>in</b> other similar <b>towns</b> <b>in</b> Central Europe and smaller than <b>in</b> other bigger <b>towns.</b> Interestingly,densities of common magpie <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> under study are even higher than density in rural areas in Slovenia and elsewhere. The main reasons for higher densities <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> are probably a result of food availability throughout the year, and lack of predators. Relationship between density of common magpie and number of inhabitants <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> was not significant (r= - 0. 30, P> 0. 05, n = 5). Due to lower densities of common magpie <b>in</b> smaller <b>towns</b> I predict that colonization was recent. Based on historic data I predict that Celje was colonized by common magpie about 20 years ago, Maribor some years earlier, whereas colonization of Slovenj Gradec, Slovenska Bistrica and žalec was in recent years. Since densities of hooded crow is lower then common magpie, colonization of this species is probably even later...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a concern}} that the growth of <b>towns</b> <b>in</b> China has been stalled {{recently}} and with it, the creation of nonfarm jobs in rural industries. The author uses the 2000 census tabulations {{to look at this}} issue by examining in-migration <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> <b>in</b> three provinces in China-Zhejiang, Henan, and Sichuan-their educational attainment, original place, and occupational composition. In addition to the diversified patterns of <b>town</b> in-migrants revealed <b>in</b> the three provinces, the author finds that town in-migrants generallypossess a higher level of educational attainment than the local population <b>in</b> <b>towns,</b> especially <b>in</b> the less developed western and central regions. This inflow of human capital could foster development <b>in</b> <b>towns.</b> There is also evidence that as economic opportunity increases <b>in</b> <b>towns,</b> such as <b>in</b> richer coastal province of Zhejiang, better educated people in rural areas are likely to shift their jobs from the farm to the nonfarm sector <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> nearby, instead of leaving the countryside to migrate to other provinces. This could reduce migration pressure on big cities. Finally, the labor market <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> <b>in</b> the less developed west and central regions is more flexible in accommodating in-migrants, whereas in the developed province of Zhejiang the labor market is segregated between migrants and the local population.

5|$|Because of {{the loss}} of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling {{newspapers}} and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He quickly learned the newsboy's patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him. According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn, approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the man asked Skelton what events were going on <b>in</b> <b>town,</b> Skelton suggested he see the new show <b>in</b> <b>town.</b> The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger {{turned out to be one}} of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.|$|E
