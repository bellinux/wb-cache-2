A review of the literature revealed the following studies on the influence of various vegetables when fed in different forms.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that iron {{deficiency}} can lead to anemia, resulting in a variety of symptoms and health issues. Negative effects can be prevented by ensuring foods with a naturally high iron content are ingested, or countered by taking nutrient supplements. As an alternative it is possible to influence the nutritional content of foods to ensure that dietary requirements are met. In this study we aimed to evaluate the potential for using iron-enriched baker’s yeast as a source of <b>iron</b> for <b>curing</b> and protection against anemia. Iron enriched yeast was prepared by growing cells on basal medium containing different concentrations of iron. Iron accumulation in yeast cells and dough leavening power increased with iron concentration and reached a maximum of 15 mg/g and 45 cm respectively, when 32 mM Fe was applied. The effects of enriched yeast on animal health were assessed by feeding anemic rats with a variety of diets containing either inorganic iron or iron enriched yeast. Body weight, iron bioavailability, blood parameters, and iron containing enzyme activity (Catalase) were studied. Groups fed on iron enriched yeast gave the highest feed efficiency, iron bioavailability and hemoglobin concentration. Different treatments raised the Catalase activity from 70 U/g tissue in anemic rats to 90 U/g tissue (iron salt added), 110 U/g tissue (iron salt and dry yeast added), 145 U/g tissue (iron enriched yeast 15 mg Fe/g diet added) and 115 U/g tissue (iron enriched yeast 30 mg Fe/g diet added). The histological study of tissues from liver, kidney, heart, and spleen of rats from different groups showed that the severe damage observed in tissues of anemic rats, was completely recovered after treatment by feeding with iron enriched yeasts, However salt-based treatments required more time to achieve the same results It is suggested that the use of iron-enriched yeast products may lead to the prevention of anemia in compromised individuals, or the ability to recover from moderate iron deficienc...|$|R

Recently, we demonstrated {{safety and efficacy}} of bovine lactoferrin (bLf) in pregnant women suffering from ID/IDA. Two clinical trials were conducted on pregnant and non-pregnant women of child-bearing age suffering from ID/IDA. In both trials, women received oral administration of bLf 100 mg/twice/day (Arm A), or ferrous sulfate 520 mg/day (Arm B). Hematological parameters, serum IL- 6 and prohepcidin were assayed before and after therapy. Unlike ferrous sulfate, bLf increased hematological parameters (P< 0. 0001). In pregnant women, bLf decreased serum IL- 6 (P< 0. 0001), and increased prohepcidin (P= 0. 0007). In non-pregnant women bLf did not change the low IL- 6 levels while it increased prohepcidin (P< 0. 0001).

The use of bovine hemoglobin as a dietary source of heme iron was found to efficiently counteract the development of iron deficiency anemia in piglets, although it did not fully rebalance their iron status. Our results revealed a concerted increase in the expression of genes responsible for apical and basolateral heme transport in the duodenum of piglets fed a heme-enriched diet.

Design Interventional study. Setting Secondary-level hospital for complicated pregnancies in Rome, Italy. Population 295 HT pregnant women (≥ 18  years) suffering from ID/IDA. Methods Women were enrolled in Arm A or B {{in accordance with their}} personal choice. In Arm A, 156 women received oral administration of 100  mg of bLf twice a day; in Arm B, 139 women received 520  mg of ferrous sulphate once a day. Therapies lasted until delivery. Main outcome measures Red blood cells, haemoglobin, total serum iron, serum ferritin (haematological parameters) were assayed before and every 30  days during therapy until delivery. Serum IL- 6, key factor in inflammatory and iron homeostasis disorders, was detected at enrolment and after therapy at delivery. Possible maternal, foetal, and neonatal adverse effects were assessed. Results Haematological parameters were significantly higher in Arm A than in Arm B pregnant women (P ≤  0. 0001). Serum IL- 6 significantly decreased in bLf-treated women and increased in ferrous sulphate-treated women. BLf did not exert any adverse effect. Adverse effects in 16. 5  % of ferrous sulphate-treated women were recorded. Arm A women experienced no miscarriage compared to five miscarriages in Arm B women. Conclusions Differently from ferrous sulphate, bLf is safe and effective in curing ID/IDA associated with a consistent decrease of serum IL- 6. The absence of miscarriage among bLf-treated women provided an unexpected benefit.

40|$|IN THE {{immediately}} preceding {{paper we}} have discussed the effect of supplementing a diet consisting of cow's whole milk with copper and iron salts on growth and reproduction in the female rat.

We first noted testicular degeneration in two male rats on this diet in some of our early experiments when studying the supplementary effect of copper and <b>iron</b> on the <b>cure</b> and prevention of anemia caused by milk diets. In those experiments it was our custom to take young rats at weaning and put them on'a sole diet of milk until a marked anemia had developed. When the hemoglobin level was sufficiently reduced, the rats were taken for experi ments in which corrective measures were tried. Out of each of two groups of such animals that had received an addition of iron and copper to the basal diet, a male and a female were retained to determine if continued growth would take place and if they would reproduce. The history of these four animals need not be detailed here, but it was eventually found that both males were sterile while one of the females mated with a stock male produced living young on this diet. One of the males died after having been on the milk diet for 39 weeks while the other male was continued {{for more than a}} year.

40|$|I ron is an {{essential}} element for humans. The body iron, about 3 g in women and 4 g in men, is mainly incorporated in the haemoglobin, myoglobin and cytocromes (2 - 2. 7 g). In bone marrow, every day, 20 mg of iron deriving from lyses of senescent erythrocytes, are utilized for the synthesis of the new erythrocyte heme. The non-hemic iron store in cells and blood is guaranteed by ferritin, a protein able to sequestrate more than 4500 iron atoms per molecule. I ron deficiency {{is the most common}} nutritional deficiency, and an important nutritional disorder afflicting about two billion of people in the world. Iron deficiency has been identified by World Health Organization as one of the ten risk factors for illness, disability and death in the world. Moreover, iron deficiency in pregnant women as a consequence of an increased iron requirement, due to enhanced blood volume and development of foetal-placenta unit, represents a high risk for maternal and infant health: preterm delivery, foetal growth retardation, low birth weight, inferior neonatal health. There are three possible ways to prevent and control the development of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia. These encompass dietary diversification, food fortification, and individual supplementation. Anyway, the preferred treatment of these pathologies consists in oral administration of iron as ferrous sulphate. However, the large quantity of ferrous sulphate to be administer to subjects, suffering of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia, is related to the poor bio-availability of inorganic iron. Moreover, ferrous sulphate oral administration often fails to exert significant effects on iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia, and frequently causes many problems, including gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and sometimes may increase the susceptibility to infections. Lactoferrin, a glycoprotein synthesised by exocrine glands and neutrophils, able to chelate two ferrric ions per molecule, can be an interesting alternative to ferrous sulphate in preventing and <b>curing</b> <b>iron</b> deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia in pregnant women. The idea to orally administer lactoferrin is very fashionable, {{by the light of the}} recent knowledge on the role of inflammation in iron homeostasis. A s matter of fact, recent clinical studies have clearly demonstrated the efficacy of lactoferrin in rescuing iron homeostasis, in the absence of any side effect. Lactoferrin, orally administered, restores the physiological levels of iron in the blood, thus preventing a cell damage induced by iron overload in the tissues...|$|R
40|$|Over 2 {{billion people}} in both {{developing}} {{as well as}} developed countries - over 30 % of the world's population - are anaemic. With the classical preconception that oral iron administration or the intake of foods rich in iron increase haemoglobin concentration and reduce the prevalence of anaemia, specific programs have been designed, but iron supplementations have been less effective than expected. Of note, this hazardous simplification on iron status neglects its distribution in the body. The correct balance of iron, defined iron homeostasis, involves a physiological ratio of iron between tissues/secretions and blood, thus avoiding its delocalization as iron accumulation in tissues/secretions and iron deficiency in blood. Changes in iron status can affect the inflammatory response in multiple ways, particularly {{in the context of}} infection, an idea that is worth remembering when considering the value of iron supplementation in areas of the world where infections are highly prevalent. The enhanced availability of free iron can increase susceptibility and severity of microbial and parasitic infections. The discovery of the hepcidin-ferroportin (Fpn) complex, which greatly clarified the enigmatic mechanism that supervises the iron homeostasis, should prompt to a critical review on iron supplementation, ineffective on the expression of the most important proteins of iron metabolism. Therefore, it is imperative to consider new safe and efficient therapeutic interventions to <b>cure</b> <b>iron</b> deficiency (ID) and ID anaemia (IDA) associated or not to the inflammation. In this respect, lactoferrin (Lf) is emerging as an important regulator of both iron and inflammatory homeostasis. Oral administration of Lf in subjects suffering of ID and IDA is safe and effective in significantly increasing haematological parameters and contemporary decreasing serum IL- 6 levels, thus restoring iron localization through the direct or indirect modulation of hepcidin and ferroportin synthesis. Of note, the nuclear localization of Lf suggests that this molecule may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of some genes of host inflammatory response. We recently also reported that combined administration of oral and intravaginal Lf on ID and IDA pregnant women with preterm delivery threat, significantly increased haematological parameters, reduced IL- 6 levels in both serum and cervicovaginal fluid, cervicovaginal prostaglandin PGF 2 alpha, and suppressed uterine contractility. Moreover, Lf combined administration blocked further the shortening of cervical length and the increase of foetal fibronectin, thus prolonging the length of pregnancy until the 37 th- 38 th week of gestation. These new Lf functions effective in curing ID and IDA through the restoring of iron and inflammatory homeostasis and in preventing preterm delivery, could have a great relevance in developing countries, where ID and IDA and inflammation-associated anaemia represent the major risk factors of preterm delivery and maternal and neonatal death...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The {{industrial}} {{importance of}} the chromium industry to South Africa is emphasised {{by the fact that}} it is considered the largest chromite (chromium ore) and ferrochrome (chrome-iron alloy) producing country in the world. Although South Africa holds three quarters of the world's chromite ore reserves, the chrome-to-iron (Cr-to-Fe) ratio of the local chromite ores is relatively low (1. 47 to 1. 55), compared to other deposits in the world (2. 6 to 3. 5). Additionally, iron is more readily reduced than chromium. The combination of these two factors implies that ferrochrome produced from South African chromite ore contains 47 - 53 % chromium. Current pricing practises in the world ferrochrome industry dictate that ferrochrome producers are only paid for the chromium content in the ferrochrome, which implies that South African ferrochrome producers export a large percentage of their product without any financial benefit. Research to improve the Cr-to-Fe ratio is therefore essential to support sustainability of the local ferrochrome industry. Conventional beneficiation methods such as gravity concentration, magnetic separation and floatation are unlikely to increase the Cr-to-Fe ratio, since both iron and chromium are part of the same mineral phase, i. e. the spinel, which requires structural dissociation. It has been proven on laboratory scale that high temperature carbochlorination (CO and Clz atmosphere) can be used to selectively remove iron from chromite. However, such methods are unlikely to be implemented on an industrial scale due to health, environmental and cost considerations. In light of this, an alternative approach to chromite chlorination, avoiding the use of chlorine and other toxic gasses, was investigated during this study. Since it was found that NaCI addition significantly improved the effectiveness of carbochlorination of chromite, the effect of adding only NaCI during high temperature treatment of chromite was investigated. The material utilised during this investigation consisted of local chromite, anthracite (source of carbon) and attapulgite clay (serving as a binder). These materials were mixed in a ratio and subsequently milled to 0 90 = 75 fJm to represent materials and specifications similar to those used during pelletisation of the chromite in the pre-reduction ferrochrome production process. This mixture could also be used to generate a partially reducing atmosphere (CO rich) during high temperature treatment, which was similar to the reaction conditions utilised during carbochlorination. The abovementioned milled mixture was pelletised into cylindrical pellets with a die set and a hydraulic press. This experimental investigation was based on a mono-variance procedure, in that the four different variables investigated, i. e. maximum pellet treatment temperature, exposure time, wt% NaCI addition to the pellets and the atmosphere the pellets were exposed to, were varied one at a time during experimentation. After each alteration of the afore-mentioned variables, the Cr-to-Fe ratios, together with other parameters, were measured. Analyses undertaken included Scanning Electron Microscopy, with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and cured breaking strength. Although this investigation did not focus on the cured breaking strength of the pellets, it is a very important industrial parameter and was therefore measured. Results indicated that the addition of NaCI had a definite effect. In both oxidising and partially reducing atmospheres the cured breaking strength of the cured pellets increased up to 800 °C exposure, whereafter it decreased. This was attributed to melting of NaCI at 801 °C. In the oxidising atmosphere, the cured breaking strength increased again at temperatures higher than 1 000 °C, due to the formation of a thin oxldised layer on the outside of the pellets, which could be confirmed by SEM analysis. Fine, metallic-like crystals were noticed inside and on the lids of crucibles in which pellets containing NaCI as an additive were cured at temperatures of 900 °C or higher. SEM-EDS analysis and weight-ratio calculations revealed that these crystals were pure FeO. This indicated that some iron might have been liberated from the chromite spinel matrix. However, ICP-OES analyses revealed that Cr-to-Fe ratios did not change significantly under any of the experimental conditions (NaCI addition 5 wt% to 15 wt%, curing between 500 'C and 1200 'C, and oxidative/partially reducing atmospheres). The observed FeO crystals did not make any meaningful difference to the Crto- Fe ratio of the chromite, but was of great academic interest as iron was extracted from the chromite spinel. This indicated that it is not only the formation of low melting point species, such as those proposed in previous mechanistic studies of carbochlorination of chromite, but that molten NaCI alone could also initiate the extraction of iron out of chromite. According to the knowledge of the author, this is the first report of its nature in open literature. SEM and SEM-EDS analyses also proved that the addition of NaCI to the chromite/carbon/clay mixtures enhanced the rate of chromite pre-reduction. This finding was in agreement with earlier literature reports. In conclusion, it can be stated that the addition of NaCI alone cannot alter the Cr-to-Fe ratio of chromite during high temperature treatment. NaCI addition did, however, have an effect on other important parameters i. e. initiation of <b>iron</b> removal, <b>cured</b> breaking strength and the rate of chromite pre-reduction. From the results and experience gained in this study, certain recommendations with regard to possible future studies could also be made. This included investigating i) other single component additives to possibly alter the Cr-to-Fe ratio during high temperature treatment, ii) the effect of industrially relevant additives such as CaO/CaC 03, Mg 03 and SiOz on the rate of chromite pre-reduction and iii) the effect of different clays (e. g. attapulgite, bentonite, etc.) on the rate of chromite pre-reduction.
