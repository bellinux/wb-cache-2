40|$|International audienceAmong the {{numerous}} solutions developed {{to improve the}} handling capability of superjunction power devices, the Deep Trench Termination (DT 2) is the most adapted thanks to its lower cost and size compared to other technologies using the multiple epitaxy technique, and an easier implementation in the fabrication process. This paper presents the optimization of the Deep Trench Termination by means of TCAD 2 D and 3 D-simulations allowing the realization of deep trench superjunction devices (diodes and MOS transistors) for 1200 V applications. The work {{is focused on the}} influence of the dielectric passivation layer thickness and the field plate length on the breakdown voltage of a DT-SJDiode. I. INTRODUCTION Today, the main IGBT competitor is the MOSFET. Indeed, the MOSFET exhibits many interesting properties for power applications: high switching speed, high input impedance and thermal stability. However, in high voltage range (600 V and above), conventional MOSFETs are limited by their very high specific on-resistance and, therefore, their high on-state voltage drop, which induces more on-state losses compared to bipolar devices. This on-resistance is inversely proportional to the doping concentration of the drift region, which must be low enough to sustain the off-state voltage: to find the best trade-off between these two parameters (specific on-resistance and breakdown voltage) {{is one of the major}} challenges in this voltage range. Recently, numerous researches have been done about the superjunction principle and about the way to realize it. Indeed, this principle allows to overcome the 'breakdown voltage/on-state resistance' trade-off. This technology was chosen in particular by Infineon for the realization of COOLMOS™ transistors [1] and by STMicroelectronics for the realization of MDMESH™ devices [2]. However, the manufacturing cost of this technology can be very high because the process requires a multiple epitaxy technique, resulting in a significant number of masks. The deep trench technology [3] is a lower cost alternative with only one <b>epitaxial</b> <b>step.</b> Like all power devices, it needs an adapted junction termination technique to reach the highest breakdown voltage. Several junction termination techniques are available [4]-[6] but our attention has stopped on the deep trenc...|$|E

40|$|Step {{meandering}} {{instability in}} a Burton-Cabrera-Frank (BCF) -type {{model for the}} growth of an isolated, atomically high step on a crystal surface is analyzed. It is assumed that the growth is sustained by the molecular precursors deposition on a terrace and their decomposition into atomic constituents; both processes are explicitly modeled. A strongly nonlinear evolution PDE for the shape of the step is derived in the long-wave limit and without assuming smallness of the amplitude; this equation may be transformed into a convective Cahn-Hilliard-type PDE for the step slope. Meandering is studied {{as a function of the}} precursors diffusivity and of the desorption rates of the precursors and adatoms. Several important features are identified, such as: the interrupted coarsening, "facet" bunching, and the lateral drift of the step perturbations (a traveling wave) when the terrace diffusion is anisotropic. The nonlinear drift introduces a disorder into the evolution of a step meander, which results in a pronounced oscillation of the step velocity, meander amplitude and lateral length scale in the steady-state that emerged after the coarsening was interrupted.

Yablonovitch [3] reported theoretical results an dispersion, light localization and modification of spontaneous emission in media with periodic refractive index patterns in two and three dimensions. A long period of great progress in modeling, patterning, etching, and characterization was required to demonstrate photonic crystals of sufficient quality, showing fundamental gaps in the visible and near infrared region. Parallel to the fundamental research, a spectrum of proposed applications offering new and attractive features of photonic crystals, has been and is still enlarging. It includes microwave antennas, photonic crystal fibers, cosmetic and food colors, car lacquers, various types of sensors, high-brightness LEDs, as well as active and passive components for telecommunications. The assessment of their feasibility is currently the subject of numerous research projects throughout the world. For telecommunications, photonic crystals other the following attractive features which mainly utilize two medium-term perspectives, compactness and photonic mode engineering: ·strong interaction between light and matter allowing for on-chip resonators of high finesse, and optical components/circuits being orders of magnitude smaller than currently fabricated devices. ·reduction of the group velocity by orders of magnitude, permitting the optimization of the chromatic dispersion and its slope. ·enhancement of tunability by concentrating the optical field in regions infiltrated with the tuning agents (especially for high index-contrast photonic crystals). ·reduced number of fabrication steps (e. g., mask layers and <b>epitaxial</b> <b>steps)</b> easing the integration of active and passive photonic functions (e. g., layers, waveguides, filters, switches) an a single chip {{on the basis of}} simplified processing. This chapter describes ongoing work within the "HIPhoCs" consortium which tackles telecom-oriented components based an high-contrast Ph Cs with refractive index steps An, > 2 between air holes and dielectric material. Photonic crystals of this type exhibit very large photonic bandgaps for both polarizations. The material systems under investigation include the two group III -V compounds InGaAsP/InP and InGaAs/GaAs, allowing for both active and passive components as well as the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) material system which is well suited for the realization of tunable passive components. Photonic crystals with an average refractive index n, > 2 operating at 1. 55 µm require elementary cells with minimum feature sizes in the sub- 100 nm range. The in-plane diameters of the eigenmodes of defect waveguides with one missing row (W 1) are also several hundred nanometers. The vertical index contrasts Onv between the refractive index step core and cladding layers, differ from one high-contrast material system to another. The PhC-components based an the III-V compounds exhibit a moderate vertical index contrast (Onv < 0. 5) in order to be compatible with both optical and optoelectronic components, whereas the SOI material system provides high refractive index contrast (Onv 2) between silica and silicon. Consequently, photonic crystals based on SOI discussed in the following can be (and are always) operated below the light-line, whereas the III-V PhCs have to be operated above, where the propagation losses are much more sensitive to the shape and depth of the photonic crystal structures. The challenging specifications for aspect ratio and surface quality require the development of novel etching technologies and equipment for all material systems. We selected a set of active and passive components presented in the following such that the feasibility of the key features from the telecommunication point of view compactness, integrability, dispersion management, and tunability can be assessed. Special focus is also given to fiber-to-chip coupling which is of particular importance for applications in telecommunications. The organization of this chapter reflects the above discussion. We start with an investigation of theoretical aspects including the light-cone problem and from that derive theoretical losses for both types of material systems. In addition, new modeling tools allowing for tolerancing of PhC-components are presented. Great emphasis will be given to crucial patterning steps such as lithography and etching along with the required equipment.

40|$|Needle fibre calcite {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{ubiquitous}} habits of calcite in vadose environments (caves deposits, soil pores, etc.). Its origin, either through inorganic, indirect or direct biological processes, has long been debated. In this study, investigations at 11 sites in Europe, Africa and Central America support arguments for its biogenic origin. The wide range of needle morphologies is the result of a gradual evolution of the simplest type, a rod. This rod is the elementary brick which, by aggregation and welding, builds more complex needles. The absence of cross-welded needles implies that they are welded in a mould, or under a longitudinal and unidirectional constraint, before being released inside the soil pores. The difference between the lengthening of the needles and the c axis can be explained by the existence of needles observed under a scanning electron microscope in organic sleeves, which can act as a mould during rod growth. Complex morphologies with epitaxial outgrowths on straight rods cannot have grown entirely inside organic microtubes; they must result from soil diagenesis after the release of straight rods in a soil-free medium. Whisker crystals are interpreted as the result of growth and coalescence of euhedral crystals on a rod. Rhomb chains are considered to be the consequence of successive <b>epitaxial</b> growth <b>steps</b> on a needle during variations in growth conditions. Isotopic signatures for needle fibre calcite vary from - 16. 63 [per mille] to + 1. 10 [per mille] and from - 8. 63 [per mille] to - 2. 25 [per mille] for Delta 13 C and Delta 18 O, respectively. The absence of high Delta 18 O values for needle fibre calcite precludes a purely physicochemical origin (evaporative) for this particular habit of calcite. As epitaxial growth cannot precipitate in the same conditions as initial needles, needle fibre calcite stable isotopic signatures should be used with caution as a proxy for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions.

Great efforts and various {{attempts have been made}} in the past decade to pursue high-performance DFB lasers, and quantum dot (QD)-based DFB lasers have exhibited advantageous performances such as low threshold current, high quantum efficiency, broadband wavelength tuning range, and high-temperature stability over commercial quantum well-based devices [4 – 6]. The modulation p-doping in quantum dot laser structures has been demonstrated as an effective method to further improve the QD laser performance including the temperature stability [7] and high-speed modulation characteristics [8] due to the significantly enhanced ground state (GS) gain. Moreover, it has also been found that rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is another efficient way to optimize the material quality and optical properties of the QD assemblies, owing to the reduction of point defects and dislocations that are produced during the epitaxy growth. The conventional fabrication process of a DFB laser usually requires two <b>steps</b> of high-quality <b>epitaxial</b> growth [9]. Stubenrauch et al. reported the fabrication of a 1.3 -μm QD DFB laser which shows high static and dynamic performance; however, after the fabrication of a Bragg grating structure and epitaxy growth of bottom cladding layer and active region, a metalorganic vapor chemical deposition (MOCVD) <b>epitaxial</b> re-growth <b>step</b> is required to complete the whole laser structure leading to many complex and uncertain factors [1]. To avoid the re-growth process, Goshima et al. proposed a QD-based laterally coupled distributed feedback (LC-DFB) laser structure which was realized by deeply etching the grating vertically into the ridge waveguide, but low slope efficiencies below 0.03  W/A and small side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of 20  dB were observed due to large waveguide losses [10]. The waveguide losses are mainly from the deep etching process, by which the high-quality and uniform grating structure is very difficult to realize due to the technical issues of high aspect ratio (normally 20 : 1) requirement in either dry etching or wet etching process [11]. So, in order to realize a super high-performance DFB laser, it is necessary to trace a way to combine the optimized QD active region with improved device waveguide structure together.|$|R
40|$|A {{technology}} for the fabrication of high-temperature step-edge junctions on large area (2 "'"') suitable for high-frequency application has been developed. For that, epitaxial growth of YBa_ 2 Cu_ 3 O_ 7 (YBCO) on steps in different materials (LaAlO_ 3, sapphire and CeO_ 2) was investigated and corresponding junctions were examined electrically and tested in magnetometers and planar gradiometers. YBCO films deposited on steps in LaAlO_ 3 by sputtering and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The more complex morphology of sputtered films indicated by secondary phases and small segments of a- and c-axis oriented YBCO was explained by the continuous film nucleation {{in contrast to the}} pulsed film nucleation of laser ablated films. Furthermore the growth on steps in sapphire and CeO_ 2 was studied by TEM and described by two models for <b>epitaxial</b> growth on <b>steps.</b> Only for steps in a CeO_ 2 buffer layer with a step angle of about 60 a controlled formation of grain boundaries was observed. In this case the YBCO film grew c-axis oriented normal to the step surface. Step-edge junctions on sapphire substrates prepared in such a way with a ratio of film thickness to step height of 3 / 2 showed resistively shunted junction like behaviour. But small modulations of the I_c(B) -curves indicated a inhomogeneous current distribution at the junction generated by imperfect film growth on the step. Nevertheless the behaviour of rf-SQUIDs on sapphire were comparable to the behaviour of SQUIDs on standard substrates (e. g. LaAlO_ 3). Furthermore planar rf-SQUID gradiometers were fabricated in multilayer technology 123 refs.

40|$|Vertical cavity surface {{emitting}} lasers (VCSELs) {{are today}} a commodity {{on the short}} wavelength laser market due to {{the ease with which}} they are manufactured. Much effort has in the last decade been directed towards making long wavelength VCSELs as successful in the marketplace. This has not been achieved due to the much more difficult fabrication technologies needed for realising high performance long wavelength VCSELs. At one point, GaInNAs quantum wells gain regions grown on GaAs substrates seemed to be the solution as it enabled all-epitaxial VCSELs that could make use of high contrast AlGaAs-based distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) as mirrors and lateral selective oxidation for optical and electrical confinement, thereby mimicking the successful design of short wavelength VCSELs. Although very good device results were achieved, reproducible and reliable epitaxial growth of GaInNAs quantum wells proved difficult and the technology has not made its way into high-volume production. Other approaches to the manufacturing and material problems have been to combine mature InP-based gain regions with high contrast AlGaAs-based DBRs by wafer fusion or with high contrast dielectric DBRs. Commonly, a patterned tunnel junction provides the electrical confinement in these VCSELs. Excellent performance has been achieved in this way but the fabrication process is difficult. In this work, we have employed high strain InGaAs quantum wells along with large detuning between the gain peak and the emission wavelength to realize GaAs-based long wavelength VCSELs. All-epitaxial VCSELs with AlGaAs-based DBRs and lateral oxidation confinement were fabricated and evaluated. The efficiency of these VCSELs was limited due to the optical absorption in the doped DBRs. To improve the efficiency and manufacturability, two novel optical and electrical confinement schemes based on epitaxial regrowth of current blocking layers were developed. The first scheme is based on a single regrowth step and requires very precise processing. This scheme was therefore not developed beyond the first generation but single mode power of 0. 3 mW at low temperature, - 10 ºC, was achieved. The second scheme is based on two <b>epitaxial</b> regrowth <b>steps</b> and does not require as precise processing. Several generations of this design were manufactured and resulted in record high power of 8 mW at low temperature, 5 ºC, and more than 3 mW at high temperature, 85 ºC. Single mode power was more modest with 1. 5 mW at low temperature and 0. 8 mW at high temperature, comparable to the performance of the single mode lateral oxidation confined VCSELs. The reason for the modest single mode power was found to be a non-optimal cavity shape after the second regrowth that leads to poor lateral overlap between the gain in the quantum wells and the intensity of the optical field.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{experiments with}} one-dimensional atomic chains grown by step decoration of vicinal Pt surfaces. The {{objective of the}} research was twofold: first, to characterize metal <b>epitaxial</b> growth on <b>stepped</b> substrates; second, {{to make use of}} this knowledge to fabricate arrays of monatomic metal wires in order to investigate their electronic and magnetic properties. The first part focuses on molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) of Ag, Cu, Co, and Ni on densely stepped Pt surfaces (one monatomic step every 20  Å). Growth was investigated on the atomic scale {{as a function of the}} substrate temperature and coverage by means of thermal energy atom scattering (TEAS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). A wide variety of growth scenarios has been characterized depending on the choice of the overlayer material and on the interplay between surface diffusion, strain and alloying. Uniform arrays of one-dimensional atomic chains of Ag, Cu, and Co can be fabricated in a well defined temperature range. The growth of alternate wires of different metals was also investigated. In the second part we have studied the chemisorption of O 2, CO, and H 2, at Pt and at Ag-decorated Pt steps. We have identified the Pt edge atoms at the top of the step as the most active sites for O 2 dissociation. Controlled decoration of the Pt steps by monatomic Ag wires was used to locally vary the reactivity of the Pt edge atoms and to further elucidate the dissociation process. Ag decoration results in a selective modification of the adsorption rate of O 2, CO, and H 2 on Pt stepped surfaces. The third part deals with the electronic and magnetic properties of Co monatomic wires grown on Pt(997). We have investigated the wire-induced valence band states by means of angle resolved photoemission (ARPES). Co 3 d states attributed to monatomic chains display a double-peaked structure that suggests the presence of a one-dimensional exchange-split band. The magnetic behavior of the Co chains was studied by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). Co monatomic chains are superparamagnetic with blocking temperature between 5 and 10  K. The one-dimensional character of the wires shows up in a pronounced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and in large values of the orbital magnetic moment compared to bulk Co and thin films...|$|R
40|$|WO 2006119927 A 1 UPAB: 20070112 NOVELTY - Production of a III-N {{substrate}} containing element(s) {{of group}} III involves: depositing III-N layer having thickness of {{greater than or}} equal to 40 microns by epitaxial growth, onto thin III-N layer of template on foreign substrate having slight intentional misorientation with respect to next crystallographic lattice plane of its surface onto which the III-N layer is deposited; or depositing layer under predetermined N/III ratio and reactor pressure, such that towards end of growth the N/III ratio and/or pressure in reactor is lowered, relative to predetermined ratio and/or pressure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Production of a III-N substrate containing element(s) of group III involves: depositing III-N layer having thickness of ({{greater than or equal}} to 40, preferably greater than 100) microns, onto thin III-N layer of template on foreign substrate having slight intentional misorientation (0. 1 - 2, preferably 0. 1 - less than 1, especially 0. 3 - 0. 6) degrees, with respect to next crystallographic lattice plane of its surface onto which the III-N layer is deposited; or depositing layer by epitaxial growth under predetermined N/III ratio and reactor pressure, such that towards end of growth the N/III ratio and/or pressure in reactor is lowered, relative to predetermined ratio and/or pressure. The reduction of the N/III ratio, and/or reactor pressure is performed to (50 - 5) % of the predetermined N/III ratio, and/or to (65 - 25) % of the predetermined pressure, respectively; in the final stage (preferably in last 60 minutes, especially in last 30 minutes) of the epitaxial growth process. The epitaxial growth is preformed by hydride vapour phase epitaxy (HVPE). INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (a) epitaxial growth for producing a thick III-N layer having a thickness of greater than 40 mm involving: depositing the layer above foreign substrate having a misorientation of 0. 1 - 2 degrees; (b) a substrate (S 1) comprising: a III-N layer having a surface roughness of 50 nm and a thickness of (40, preferably 100, especially 150) mm, at least on one side; and (c) a semiconductor device comprising: a foreign substrate having a misorientation of 0. 1 - 2 degrees, with at least one III-N layer provided on at least one of its surfaces. USE - For production of a III-N substrate containing element(s) of group III, used in a semiconductor device (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method provides thick III-N layers capable of growing with a (0001) - or C-plane surface, and exhibiting improved surface properties, and are suitable as substrate for further <b>epitaxial</b> growth <b>steps.</b> The <b>epitaxial</b> growth performed on a template whose foreign substrate has a slight miscut with respect to the next crystallographic lattice plane of its surface above which epitaxial growth occurs, with a thin first III-N layer deposited on it, results in thick III-N layers of {{greater than or equal to}} 40 microns thickness with very smooth surface morphology, without the requirement of additional steps like high temperature annealing (e. g. at a temperature of greater than or equal to 1200 degreesC for greater than or equal to 1 hour) etching and/or polishing of the initial first III-N layer; as compared to the prior art methods that involve production of template on a foreign substrate with exact orientation and without miscut, which provide deposition of a thin III-N layer with smooth surface morphology of the thin layer, while allowing further growth of thick layers with microscopically rough surfaces often covered with a high density of hexagonal pyramids. The surface morphology of the substrate can also be significantly improved by lowering the N/III ratio and/or reactor pressure in the last part of the epitaxial growth process by the hydride vapour phase epitaxy (HVPE), even without using exact substrates without the miscut...|$|R
40|$|Surface spin {{waves on}} 3 d {{ferromagnetic}} films are {{studied in the}} large wave vector regime {{with the help of}} a recently developed high resolution electron energy loss spectrometer. As a first study, face centered cubic (fcc) cobalt films were prepared by the epitaxial growth of cobalt on Cu(100). Spin waves were probed along the [110]- and the [010]-direction with in-plane wave vectors ranging from 0. 02 nm^- 1 to 0. 1 nm^- 1. The directional anisotropy in the surface spin wave dispersion is found to be very small in this system. In the low wave vector regime (wave vector < 0. 035 nm^- 1), standing spin wave modes are observed in addition to the surface spin waves. In cobalt, like in other transition metal ferromagnets, the 3 d electrons are not localized. Rather they form a band of considerable width which offers the possibilityfor spin-flip excitations (Stoner-excitations) in a wide energy-momentum range. The damping of spin waves by Stoner excitations results in large energy width of the spin wave signals. For the well-defined spin waves of cobalt, the line-widths of the surface spin wave signals were quantitatively determined. As a next <b>step,</b> <b>epitaxial</b> nickel films were prepared by deposition on Cu(100). In agreement with earlier unpublished work, no spin wave excitation is observed in Ni by inelastic electron scattering presumably due to the strong damping of the spin waves. As an attempt to study the effect of nickel on cobalt surface spin waves, layers of Ni were deposited on top of Co/Cu(100). Spin waves are seen for up to three monolayers of Ni. By a careful study of the intensity of spin waves as a function of Ni layer thickness, it is proven that spin waves are localized at the Co side of the Ni/Co interface. The presence of Ni broadens the spin wave peak compared to bare Co spin waves, indicating additional decay channels provided by the nickel capping layer. The 3 d-band of copper is fully occupied, and hence copper has less low energy excitations. As a consequence, the mean free path of electrons in copper is much larger than in nickel. This provided the opportunity to look at spin waves localized at the Co interface through thicker layers (up to 12 layers) of copper. A similar spin wave broadening as for nickel is observed for copper. One of the extensively studied systems in thin film magnetism is Fe/Cu(100) due to its richness in structural and magnetic phenomena. At least three different magnetic phases can be stabilized depending on the film thickness. In this thesis, surface spin waves of three to five monolayer iron films were studied. From the similarity to the surface spin wave dispersion of bcc Fe films, it is concluded that the observedspin waves arise from the so-called nanomartensitic phase. The nanomartensitic phase is locally similar to a bcc structure, however lacking the perfect long range order of the latter. The spin wave dispersion measured on iron films deposited on fcc Co(100) is found to be nearly identical to that of Fe/Cu(100), indicating the structural similarity of the two systems...|$|R
