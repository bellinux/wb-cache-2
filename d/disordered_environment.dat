The 1650s saw the introduction of a wider color-scheme.

40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. This study {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} the information processing environment, manipulated to be ordered or disordered, affected the amount of effort committed to information processing within the environment. Numerous lines of research have proposed that people often approach information-processing situations by employing one of two general processing modes. Each approach, as experienced by the individual, can be characterized by either high cognitive effort (slow processing) or low cognitive effort (fast processing). High cognitive effort processing is marked by more analysis, and making more subtle distinctions concerning the stimuli relative to low effort processing. Recent findings suggest that individuals engage in less effortful behavior in a <b>disordered</b> <b>environment</b> relative to an ordered environment. Consequently this study predicted that attitude judgments would be made faster in disordered environments rather than ordered environments, and attitude judgments would show less variability in disordered environments rather than ordered environments. Participants in the <b>disordered</b> <b>environment</b> made faster attitude judgments than participants in ordered environments, however attitude judgments did not should less variability in disordered environments rather than ordered environments.

The interplay of different time and length scales is revealed by the intermediate scattering functions, which are sensitive both to the underlying spatial fractal as well as the anomalous transport. We compare our numerical results in the transition regime to a mode- coupling approach, and find that certain aspects are surprisingly well predicted. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{disorder}} in the vibrational bath of an ensemble of open quantum systems is explored, arising either from {{variation in the}} overall coupling strength or from uncertainty {{in the shape of}} the environment spectral function. Such disorder leads to an additional source of decoherence of subsystem ensembles, due to variation in the reorganization energy. Additionally, vibrational disorder induces a shift in the oscillation frequency of the coherence between ground and excited states. This shift is temperature dependent, and in the high temperature limit δω∝ T. This latter finding could be of particular relevance to biological systems exhibiting long lived coherences in highly <b>disordered</b> <b>environments,</b> where temperature-dependent quantum beats have been observed.

We show a sharp peak in the distribution of displacement P(x,t) around x= 0, that has frequently been observed in experiments, but not previously explained theoretically. We analytically estimate the diffusion coefficient D_dis and its fluctuation over samples of finite size. We examine the fidelity of the coarse-grained diffusion map, which is reconstructed from particle trajectories.
