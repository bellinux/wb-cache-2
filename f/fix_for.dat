Various features lined up for 4.1 include comments on text ranges, IAccessible2, in-place editing of Input Fields, interactive cropping, importing pictures from files and other improvements. 4.1.1 (released 14 August 2014) fixed critical issues in 4.1. 4.1.2 (released in October 2015) was a bugfix release, with improvements in packaging and removal of the HWP file format support associated with the vulnerability CVE-2015-1774. 4.1.3 (September 2016) had updates to the existing language dictionaries, enhanced build tools for AOO developers, a bug <b>fix</b> <b>for</b> databases on macOS, and a security <b>fix</b> <b>for</b> vulnerability CVE-2016-1513. 4.1.4 contained security fixes.|$|E
25|$|Sherman White, {{along with}} {{teammates}} Bigos and Smith, disregarded Sollazzo's intended <b>fix</b> <b>for</b> a game played on January16 against Duquesne.

25|$|A {{minor version}} of FreeHand 10 (10.0.1) {{came as a}} result of Adobe winning a lawsuit against Macromedia for {{infringement}} on a Tabbed Panels patent. A reworking of the user interface produced this temporary <b>fix</b> <b>for</b> the panel issue. 10.0.1 was available with the Studio MX bundle or as a new purchase but not available as a patch to existing users.|$|E
25|$|Windows 7 SP1 {{has broken}} {{backwards}} compatibility of MDAC 2.8.

Microsoft has provided solutions to work around this issue for some applications but VBA applications remain affected. The <b>fix</b> <b>for</b> this issue has been release in February 2012.|$|E
25|$|In July 2012, Freedom was dry docked {{in order}} to expand {{berthing}} by 20 and for firefighting and boat handling improvements.

25|$|The {{intent of}} the changes from ECMA-376 1st Edition to ISO/IEC 29500:2008 was that a valid ECMA-376 {{document}} {{would also be a}} valid ISO 29500 Transitional document; however, at least one change introduced at the BRM—refusing to allow further values for xsd:boolean—had the effect of breaking backwards-compatibility for most documents. A <b>fix</b> <b>for</b> this had been suggested to ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG4, and was approved in June 2009 as a recommendation for the first revision to Office Open XML.|$|E
25|$|Interest {{in using}} the valley as a water source or {{reservoir}} dates {{back as far as}} the 1850s, when the Tuolumne Valley Water Company proposed developing water storage there for irrigation. By the 1880s, San Francisco was looking to Hetch Hetchy water as a <b>fix</b> <b>for</b> its outdated and unreliable water system. The city would try repeatedly to acquire water rights to Hetch Hetchy, including in 1901, 1903 and 1905, but was continually rebuffed because of conflicts with irrigation districts that had senior water rights on the Tuolumne River, and because of the valley's national park status.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} criticised for some {{negative}} issues, {{such as the}} aiming system in gunplay. The developer had initially countered complaints that the game's aiming was inaccurate in a blog post on its official site. However, after complaints continued on the Naughty Dog forum and NeoGAF, a patch to address concerns about the game's aiming system was impending after developer Naughty Dog invited a couple of fans to its HQ to discuss the problem. On November 27, 2011, Naughty Dog released a patch that offered a <b>fix</b> <b>for</b> those unhappy with the game's refined aiming controls. The update offers the option of toggling between the new controls and a set-up {{more in line with}} that found in Uncharted 2. Despite being addressed in the previous games in the series, another minor issue raised was that of the game's linearity. Amy Hennig, in an interview with GameTrailers, defended this aspect by arguing that too little linearity in the series would have affected the game's narrative.|$|E

25|$|The ridge southward to Swirl How {{is named}} Top of Broad Slack, Broad Slack being a ferociously steep grass slope {{climbing}} out of Greenburn between the crags. This {{is the site of}} a wartime aircrash and bears the sad remains of a Royal Canadian Air Force Handley Page Halifax bomber. The undercarriage, together with a wooden cross and memorial cairn is {{on the top of the}} ridge with the rest of the wreckage spread down Broad Slack. During a night time navigation exercise in 1944, the RCAF Halifax from RAF Topcliffe became lost in thick cloud while over the north west of England. In an attempt to wait out the blanket of grey, they circled in hope the cloud would clear, ultimately becoming hopelessly lost. To try to get a visual <b>fix</b> <b>for</b> the navigator, the pilot dropped the bomber out of the cloud base, with no knowledge of what was below him. Unfortunately, for both him, the crew and the aircraft, they were greeted by the great rising fells of Swirl How and Great Carrs. With no time to react, the aircraft hit the mountainside killing all on board. Despite the crew perishing in the impact, the bomber remained largely intact and, to prevent other aircraft from spotting it and reporting it repeatedly, the wreckage was cut into a number of smaller, moveable pieces and discarded down Broad Slack, where parts of it are still visible today. Over the years, two of the four Rolls-Royce engines were recovered from the crash site by an RAF helicopter, one of which is now on display at the Ruskin Museum in Coniston. In contrast to the craggy scarp of the east face, the western slope of the ridge descends over grass to the col of Fairfield, forming a tilted triangular plateau. Across Fairfield is the rocky top of Grey Friar.|$|E

500|$|Otay Mesa Road was widened to six lanes in 2000, {{at a cost}} of $20.5million. Before, it had 50percent more traffic than it was {{designed}} to handle; it was considered by the San Diego Union-Tribune as [...] "California's busiest trade route with Mexico", and traffic had increased by a factor of ten, with the number of people dying in traffic accidents approaching five times the state average. The widening of Otay Mesa Road was considered a temporary <b>fix</b> <b>for</b> the problem. The next year, the California Transportation Commission allocated $25million of state funding towards completing the freeway. The interchange with Siempre Viva Road opened on December 8, 2004. Delays in the U.S. Congress approving federal funding in 2005 resulted in a delayed start to construction for the rest of SR905.|$|E
