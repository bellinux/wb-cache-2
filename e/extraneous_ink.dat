The intersection point may involve subtle deviations from the normal manner of deposition or production that can be observed on microscopic examination (e.g. <b>extraneous</b> <b>ink</b> deposits, skipping, misalignents, embossing, etc.).

Intersections involving indentations may also be assessed using an electrostatic detection device to visualize latent indentations.|$|E
