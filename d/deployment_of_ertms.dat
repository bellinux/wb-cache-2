Indeed, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), signed at July 2008, between the European Commission and the European Railway Associations (CER – UIC – UNIFE – EIM – GSM-R Industry Group – ERFA), concerns the strengthening of cooperation for speeding up the <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> <b>ERTMS.</b> Our work belongs to this European approach. Indeed, in the chapter 5 of the MoU, testing procedures are considered as a fundamental factor to successfully implement ERTMS. The Parties acknowledge and welcome the efforts made by the suppliers in the field of interoperability testing between different suppliers in-lab, on site or in dedicated test facilities.|$|E

To overcome these problems, we suggest a novel converted wave imaging condition {{motivated by the}} specific feature <b>of</b> <b>ERTM</b> that can generate converted waves at the image points when proper elastic models are used. Comparisons with the zero-lag crosscorrelation imaging condition demonstrate that ERTM with our proposed imaging condition can compensate polarity reversals as well as suppress spurious events and even provides the improvement of imaging resolution. © 2015 SEG.

40|$|The {{modification}} of NaYF 4 :Yb,Er(Tm) nanoparticles synthesized {{in the presence}} of an ionic surfactant is critical to their application in biological fields for better solubility and biocompatibility. In this work, NaYF 4 :Yb,Er(Tm) was transformed from insoluble, inactive to hydrophilic, biocompatible via ligand exchange modification with polyacrylic acid (PAA). Ligand exchange was carried out at room temperature when a colloidal solution of NaYF 4 :Yb,Er(Tm) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) was treated with excess PAA. The PAA modified NaYF 4 :Yb,Er(Tm) nanoparticles got better surface properties but with declined inner up-conversion fluorescence. Generally, coating an analogous layer of material outside the core nanoparticles can improve the optical properties of the core. Accordingly, NaYF 4 :Yb,Er(Tm) /NaYF 4 nanoparticles were synthesized before PAA modification to avoid the optical intensity decaying. The result of fluorescence test proved that the water soluble NaYF 4 :Yb,Er(Tm) /NaYF 4 /PAA nanocomposites had a sound up-conversion property compared with that of NaYF 4 :Yb,Er(Tm) /PAA. Furthermore, the up-conversion fluorescence property of the nanocomposite varied with the doping ratio <b>of</b> <b>Er(Tm)</b> to Yb and the possible mechanism for this change was also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Policy {{intervention}} {{schemes for}} increased <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> solar photovoltaics (PV) have been launched in several countries, with varying success. In {{order to ensure}} an efficient <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> the technology, thorough knowledge is needed about relevant present actors and institutions, and about how a desirable actor base and institutional setup should look like; mere cost reductions are not enough to guarantee <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> a new technology. A framework that captures the systemic nature of technical change, i. e. the development and <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> new technology, is the technological innovation systems (TIS) framework. The objective {{of this paper is}} to discuss how the TIS framework could be used to analyze policy for PV with a focus on <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> grid-connected, building-sited PV systems. So far, little emphasis has been on using TIS for detailed analysis <b>of</b> <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> new emerging energy technologies. The TIS framework has been used for analyzing market growth of new energy technologies including processes <b>of</b> <b>deployment</b> in parallel with processes of technology development and production. We argue that “upstream” parts of the PV value chain differ fundamentally from “downstream” parts in that “upstream” activities (e. g. production of purified silicon, wafers, and solar cells) can often be understood as pertaining to a global TIS, while “downstream” activities (system installation etc.) could generally be assumed to be part of a more local (or national) TIS, and we identify and discuss components and processes of the TIS that are of particular importance for <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> PV...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{decision}} tree model for evaluation {{of the next generation}} radiation portal technology (Advanced Spectroscopic Portals or ASPs) to scan containers entering the United States non-intrusively against nuclear or radiological weapons. Advanced Spectroscopic Portals are compared against the current designs of portal monitors (plastic scintillators or PVTs). We consider five alternative deployment strategies: 1) Exclusive <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> ASPs replacing all the PVTs currently deployed at U. S. ports of entry, 2) Sequential <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> ASPs with PVTs installing ASPs in all secondary and some primary inspections areas, 3) Sequential <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> ASPs with PVTs installing APs in only secondary inspections areas, 4) Exclusive <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> PVTs, 5) Stop <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> new portal monitors and continue inspections with the current capacity. The baseline solution recommends a hybrid strategy that supports the <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> new designs of portal monitors for secondary inspections and current designs of portal through ports of entry, the probability of successful detonation, detection probabilities and the extra deterrence that each alternative may provide. We also illustrate that the list of most significant parameters depends heavily on the dollar equivalent of overall consequences and the probability of attack attempt. For low probability and low consequence scenarios, false alarm related parameters are found to have more significance. Our extensive exploratory analysis shows that for most parametric combinations, continued <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> portal monitors is recommended. Exclusive <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> ASPs is optimal under high risk scenarios. However, we also show that if ASPs fail to improve detection capability, then extra benefits they offer in reducing false alarms may not justify their mass deployment...|$|R
