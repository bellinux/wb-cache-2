5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, {{ignoring}} {{the threat posed}} by the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> to take the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated a large area and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} June 1775, Colonel Joseph Goreham {{had been ordered}} by General Thomas Gage to raise the Royal Fencible American Regiment of Foot and natives in Nova Scotia {{for the defense of}} the {{province}} against Patriot activity. Arriving at the fort in the summer of 1776, Colonel Goreham and a garrison of 200 Loyalist troops of the RFA did what they could to restore the premises to a defensible condition. But Goreham had not been adequately provisioned and his men lacked everything from victuals to uniforms. Furthermore, the locals were generally sympathetic to the Patriot cause, and refused to assist in rehabilitating the fort, <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> to induce members of the garrison to defect.|$|E

25|$|Onegin himself, however, {{tried as}} he could to prevent the fatal outcome, and killed Lensky unwillingly and almost by accident. As the first shooter, he couldn't {{show that he was}} {{deliberately}} trying to miss the opponent, because this was considered as a serious insult and could create a formal reason to appoint another duel. Instead, he tried to minimize his chances by shooting without precise aiming, from the maximal possible distance, not <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> to come closer and get a clear shot.|$|E

Additionally, letters from his family back in Germany explained that the Nazis still wanted to exact their revenge, leaving him {{in a constant state}} of fear. Sebold was diagnosed with manic depression and committed to Napa State Hospital in 1965. Five years later he suffered a heart attack and died.|$|E

Matthias was thrilled and urged Thomas to send his son as soon as possible. During Thomas' long absence, Turks broke into Bosnia and besieged Bobovac and Vranduk, but his son Stephen and brother Radivoj escaped. Thomas {{returned}} to Bosnia in mid-January 1459 and took up {{the fight against the}} attackers, <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> to eject them from Hodidjed.

Steve divorced Rachel and reunited with Alice. Steve was charged with embezzlement and sentenced to prison. The day before he began his sentence, Steve and Alice married {{for the second time}} (on AWs tenth-anniversary telecast). Rachel continued to scheme, <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> to evict Alice from the house Steve had given her, causing Alice to have another mental breakdown. The triangle finally ended when Steve was supposedly killed in a helicopter crash in Australia.|$|E
25|$|The Herero {{entered into}} an {{alliance}} with the Germans, thinking they could get an upper hand on the Nama. The Germans set up a garrison at the Herero capital and started allocating Herero land for white settlements, including the best grazing land in the central plateau, and made tax and labor demands. The Herero and Ovambanderu rebelled, but the rebellion was crushed and leaders were executed. Between 1896 and 1897, rinderpest crippled the economic backbone of the Herero and Nama economy and slowed white expansion. The Germans continued the policy of making Namibia a white settlement by seizing land and cattle, and <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> to export Herero labor to South Africa.|$|E

25|$|In series 2, another {{character}} was created, Gayle Shand, played by Tamsin Greig. Gayle {{was a former}} employee of Prentiss McCabe and Charles's former girlfriend, {{with whom she had}} a heavily sexual relationship (they often made love whilst listening to classical music). However, the relationship fell apart after Gayle told Charles that she was already married to an insect specialist from Philadelphia. She now runs a rival firm to Prentiss McCabe, which is a much larger company, and is often trying to win Archie's contract, or is the agent of a rival client to Prentiss McCabe's current one. For example, whilst Charles and Martin work for the PM via Archie, Gayle is the spin doctor for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Prentiss McCabe always {{come up with a plan}} to keep Archie on their side, despite Gayle's attempts to stop them, <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> to make Charles a partner in her firm.|$|E
25|$|The {{women and}} {{children}} were soon released from the Fellman camp and 13,000 Reds were moved to the Hennala camp. Most of them were men, but among the detainees were also more than 1,000 women and a smaller number of children. According to the past research, all women were released, but recent {{studies have shown that the}} Women's Red Guard fighters were systematically executed by the Whites and most likely sexually abused. At least 218 women were shot, the youngest being only 14-year-old girls. Total number of executed Reds was more than 500. The executions were carried out by the Finnish battalion led by the Estonian colonel Hans Kalm. The Germans shot only approximately 20–30 Reds during the Battle of Lahti but did not participate the later executions. In some cases they were <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> to stop the Whites of executing their prisoners. The Germans usually robbed the killed as well as the captured Reds of their personal possessions. This was verified in the war diaries of the German officer Hans Tröbst, released as the sixth part of the 2015 book Der Krieg im Westen.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Slate, Sam Adams {{stated that}} Hawley's {{intention}} to deconstruct the superhero genre [...] "doesn’t {{seem like an}} accurate description of what the series is doing, or <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> to do", calling the series [...] "a well-appointed show: It’s handsomely shot, and smartly acted, and ingeniously constructed enough to suggest there’s something mind-blowing lurking at its center ... it starts {{to feel like a}} show with a Rubik’s cube where its heart should be." [...] David Sims at The Atlantic called Legion [...] "the latest, and most indulgent, entrant" [...] in a trend of [...] "shows that rely far less on plot than on mood, that are crammed with stunning visuals and frustrating, circular dialogue." [...] Sims praised the series' style and Stevens' performance, but felt that [...] "it tries so hard to dazzle that it forgets to tell a meaningful story." [...] The Washington Posts Hank Stuever also questioned the need for another series where [...] "viewers find themselves trapped {{in the center of a}} tortured mind". Stuever had mixed feelings for the show overall, calling it [...] "beautifully made" [...] but asking, [...] "Must it always be the viewer’s job to pick up the pieces?" ...|$|E

500|$|However, {{the film}} was not without its detractors. Richard Roeper gave the film a C+, saying [...] "This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets." [...] Stephen Whitty of Newark Star-Ledger gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and said [...] "The artwork is accomplished, and intricate. The G-rating is genuine, without any gross-out gags. And there's none of the usual winks to the adults with tired, pop-culture references." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote [...] "Both the {{originality}} and stirring emotional complexity of Monsters, Inc., with its exquisitely painful and touching parallels with the human world, are missing." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and said [...] "This {{is not a bad}} movie, and to small children {{it will be a very}} good one, but it's closer to average than one would wish from the company that gave us Up, WALL-E, The Incredibles, and the Toy Story series." [...] Rene Rodriguez of Miami Herald gave the film two stars out of five and wrote that it [...] "feels half-hearted and lazy, like they weren't <b>even</b> <b>trying.</b> At least show a little effort, guys." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Loser Must Bow" [...] {{match between}} the Junkyard Dog and Harley Race (with Bobby Heenan and [...] "The Queen of Wrestling" [...] The Fabulous Moolah) followed. Prior to the match [...] "Mean" [...] Gene Okerlund interviewed Heenan, Race, and Moolah backstage, where Moolah {{predicted}} that Junkyard Dog {{would have to}} bow to the King as {{he is supposed to}} do. Bobby then gave Moolah the crown and told her {{to put it on the}} King's head after the match, [...] "As only the Queen of Wrestling can do". Junkyard Dog came out to the ring to a big ovation in the Silverdome. During the match, the two battled back and forth, with Race <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> unsuccessfully to give the prone Dog a falling headbutt which naturally failed. Following this Race recovered enough to give the Junkyard Dog a belly to belly suplex when he was distracted by Bobby Heenan to get the win. Due to the pre-match stipulation, JYD did a little bow and then hit Race from the blindside with a steel chair to a rousing ovation from the crowd. After attacking Race, Junkyard Dog took the King's royal robe and left the ring with it in hand to a standing ovation.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today was {{critical}} of the episode, writing [...] "It is possible [...] has worn out the Treehouse franchise. [...] three installments just seem to be reaching for jokes that aren't there, and falling in the attempt. [...] As you'd hope from The Simpsons, the segments all boast a few clever moments {{that will make you}} smile if not laugh. But they're not scary, they're not particularly funny, and outside of some tepid Twilight jokes, they're no longer <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> to be real parodies of the original stories." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also gave the episode a negative review, and felt that [...] "There were laughs in all three segments, but the episode as a whole left something to be desired. The first [...] eventually descended into a long string of mostly lame board game jokes, as if the writers had been coming up with board game puns for the last 15 seasons or something and wanted an excuse to unload a bunch of them all at once. The idea of Bart and Milhouse playing with a Ouija board ripoff was promising, so to see it descend into gags about Marge getting sucked into Clue was disappointing. There were fewer good gags [...] than in the board game segment, but it was balanced out by a fairly solid Hugh Laurie performance. Fortunately, the last segment, the inevitable Twilight parody, was funny across the board, both in how it took the piss out of the Twilight films and how it satirized vampire mania. [...] Still, it wasn't the best [...] "Treehouse" [...] ever, and you could make a good claim for it being the worst, particularly if the Twilight segment wasn't in there." ...|$|E
