40|$|Polygonal shafts {{are a major}} {{competitor}} {{to spline}} and <b>keyed</b> <b>shafts</b> for power transmission due to features as self-centering, lack of stress concentration area, and ease of assembly and disassembly. Past studies on polygonal profiles have focused on a single profile and comparisons based on nominal sizes of three and four lobe profiles. This research explores the loading strength of the standardized three and four lobe polygonal shafts and hubs manufactured from the same stock size, subjected to pure torsional and torsional bending load from a spur gear of 20 ° pressure angle at various fits. In absence of analytical solution, Finite element method has been used after verifying the results experimentally, theoretically, and DIN standard. From the finite element analysis, the hub was found to experience greater stress than the shaft in all cases. The clearance fit {{was found to be}} the most critical connection and interference fit to be the most suitable for larger power transmission. The P 4 C connection had greater stress, especially in the hub, than the P 3 G connection. The difference between the P 4 C shaft and the P 3 G shaft was 4. 05 % in the interference fit and 60. 6 % in the clearance fit, suggesting P 4 C clearance fit to be less favorable for larger power transmission. Owing to its small normal axial stress, the P 4 C clearance fit has its use in low power transmission where sliding fit is a requirement. The reason for greater stress in P 4 C shaft and hub connection is due to the large pressure angle at the point of contact, which leads to a smaller contact area and greater contact pressure. The contact pressure was found to be triangular shaped in clearance and transition fit and with a large crest, followed by a trough and a small crest in interference fit for torsional bending load...|$|R

The critical threshold is found by examination of the eigenvalues corresponding to linear formulas derived via uni-modal Galerkin's discretisation of partial dierential equations of motion. The main goal of the paper is determination of such a distribution of the volume fraction of the active phase within the shaft, which makes the system possibly most resistant to self-excitation on the one hand, and still attractive in terms of strength properties on the other.

The P 3 G and P 4 C shaft and hub have been compared for interference, line to line and clearance fit. The conformal contact between the shaft and the hub in polygonal profile makes it difficult to design them analytically.

The coal bed is thin and uniclinal with a dip angle of 35 °. So long wall retreating mining method along the strike will be adopted.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to apply {{computed}} order tracking with subsequent rotation domain averaging and statistical analysis to typical mining environments. Computed order tracking is a fault detection method that is unaffected by varying speed conditions often found in industry and has been proven effective in laboratory conditions. However in the controlled environment of a laboratory it is difficult to test the robustness of the order-tracking procedure. The need thus exists to adjust the order tracking procedure so that it will be effective in the mining environment. The procedure needs to be adjusted to function with a two pulse per revolution speed input. The drag gear aboard a dragline rotates in two directions. This gives the unique opportunity to observe the performance of the order tracking method in a bi-directional rotating environment allowing relationships between the results of each operating direction to be investigated. A monitoring station was set up aboard a dragline and data was captured twice daily for a period spanning one year. The data captured consisted of accelerometer and proximity sensor data. The <b>key</b> on the <b>shaft</b> triggers the proximity sensors allowing speed and direction to be measured. The rudimentary measured speed is interpolated using various documented speed interpolation techniques and by a newly developed speed interpolation technique. The interpolated speed is then used to complete the order tracking procedure that re-samples the vibration data with reference to the speed. The results indicate that computed order tracking can be successfully implemented in typical mining environments. Furthermore there is a distinct relationship between vibration data taken in both rotational directions: one direction provides a better indication of incipient failure. It is thus important not to choose a direction randomly when monitoring rotating machinery of this kind. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.
