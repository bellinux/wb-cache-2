Frustrated by his lack of progress and the brutality of the training, Wesley insists he is ready, but Sloan disagrees. Wesley refocuses on his training and starts to excel.

5|$|Tatars {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Kadan experienced a major failure in March 1242 at Klis Fortress, when they were hunting for Béla IV of Hungary. The Tatars believed that the king was in the Klis Fortress, and so they began to attack from all sides, launching arrows and hurling spears. However, the natural defenses of the fortress gave protection, and the Tatars could cause only limited harm. They dismounted from their horses and began to creep up hand over hand to higher ground. But the fortress defenders hurled huge stones at them, and managed to kill a great number. This setback only made the Tatars more ferocious, and they came right up to the great walls and fought <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>hand.</b> They looted the houses in the outskirt of the fortress and took away much plunder, but failed to take Klis altogether. Upon learning that the king was not there, they abandoned their attack, and ascending their mounts rode off in the direction of Trogir, a number of them turning off toward Split.|$|E
5|$|The 44th Brigade {{encountered}} little opposition until {{coming under}} machine gun fire {{at a small}} stream, following which German resistance was much heavier. Between 0830 and 0930, the 6th Battalion, The Royal Scots Fusiliers and the 8th Battalion, The Royal Scots reached their initial objectives of Sainte Manvieu and La Gaule. After much <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> fighting they believed the villages to be captured just after midday, although they later found that some German remnants were holding out. Tanks and infantry from the 12th SS and the 21st Panzer divisions launched two counter-attacks to regain Sainte Manvieu but were repulsed {{with the aid of}} intensive artillery fire. The main German opposition in this section of their outpost line, had been from part of the I Battalion, 26th Panzergrenadier Regiment, which had been mostly overrun and the divisional pioneer battalion. The Germans in Rauray, which had not been captured the previous day, were able to subject the British brigades to observed artillery and indirect tank fire, causing considerable casualties and destruction, especially within the village of Cheux.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} at a {{stalemate}} {{for the next five}} or six hours, with all the participants immobilized. Bonnet's men had the advantage that their deck was heeled away from their opponents, giving them cover, while the Henrys deck was tilted toward the pirates, thus exposing Rhett's men to punishing musket volleys. Bonnet's force suffered twelve casualties while killing ten and wounding fourteen of Rhett's 70-man crew. Most of Bonnet's men fought enthusiastically, challenging their enemies to board and fight <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>hand,</b> and tying a knot in their flag as a mock signal to come aboard and render aid. Bonnet himself patrolled the deck with a pistol drawn, threatening to kill any pirate who faltered in the fight. Nevertheless, some of the prisoners who had been forced to join the pirate crew refused to fire on Rhett's men, and one narrowly escaped death at Bonnet's hands in the confusion of the engagement.|$|E
5|$|With Cooke dead, Cumby assumed command. Bellerophons decks {{had largely}} been cleared by French fire, and {{boarding}} parties {{began to make}} their way onto the ship. Several French sailors climbed out onto Bellerophons spritsail yard, but a Bellerophon crewman released the brace holding the yard, causing them to fall into the sea. French sailors holding onto Bellerophons rails had their hands beaten until they were forced to let go. Bellerophons ensign had been shot away three times, so infuriating her yeoman of signals, Christopher Beaty, that he took the largest Union Jack he could find and climbed up into the mizzen rigging and hoisted it across the shrouds. The French riflemen on Aigle reportedly held their fire as he did this, in admiration of his bravery. The two ships were so close together that gun crews on their lower decks were fighting <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> at the gunports, while grenades lobbed through the ports caused heavy casualties. One grenade thrown into Bellerophon exploded in the gunner's storeroom, blowing open the door but fortunately blowing closed the door of the magazine. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a catastrophic explosion.|$|E

40|$|Human {{hands are}} an {{important}} source of microbial contamination of foods. However, published data on the effectiveness of handwashing and glove use in a foodservice setting are limited. Bacterial transfer through foodservice quality gloves was quanti ed using nalidixic acid-resistant Enterobacter aerogenes (a nonpathogenic surrogate with attachment characteristics similar to Salmonella). Five transfer rates were determined: chicken <b>to</b> bare <b>hand,</b> chicken <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> through gloves, bare <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce, <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce through gloves (with low inoculum on <b>hands),</b> and <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce through gloves (with high inoculum on hands). At least 30 observations were made for each percent transfer rate using 30 individual volunteers. The logarithm of percent transfer data were then t to distributions: chicken <b>to</b> bare <b>hand,</b> normal (0. 71, 0. 42); chicken <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> through gloves, gamma (5. 91, 0. 40, 25. 00); bare <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce, logistic (1. 16, 0. 30); <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce through gloves (low inoculum), normal (0. 35, 0. 88); <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> lettuce through gloves (high inoculum), normal (22. 52, 0. 61). A 0. 01 % transfer was observed from food <b>to</b> <b>hands</b> and from <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> food when subjects wore gloves and a 10 % transfer was observed without a glove barrier. These results indicate that gloves are permeable to bacteria although transfer from <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> food through a glove barrier was less than without a glove barrier. Our results indicate that gloves may reduce both bacterial transfer from food <b>to</b> the <b>hands</b> of foodservice workers and in subsequent transfer from <b>hands</b> back <b>to</b> food.

25|$|There {{have been}} {{a wide variety of}} rapidly {{advancing}} tactics throughout the history of war, ranging from conventional war to asymmetric warfare to total war and unconventional warfare. Techniques include <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> combat, the use of ranged weapons, naval warfare, and, more recently, air support. Military intelligence has often {{played a key role in}} determining victory and defeat. Propaganda, which often includes information, slanted opinion and disinformation, plays a key role both in maintaining unity within a warring group and in sowing discord among opponents. In modern warfare, soldiers and combat vehicles are used to control the land, warships the sea, and aircraft the sky. These fields have also overlapped in the forms of marines, paratroopers, aircraft carriers, and surface-to-air missiles, among others. Satellites in low Earth orbit have made outer space a factor in warfare as well through their use for detailed intelligence gathering; however, no known aggressive actions have been taken from space.|$|E

From 18 to 20 February, the strategic heights of Kojori and Tabakhmela passed from <b>hand</b> <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> in heavy fighting. Georgian forces under General Giorgi Mazniashvili managed to push the Soviets back inflicting heavy losses; they quickly regrouped and tightened the circle around Tbilisi. By 23 February, the railway bridges had been restored, and Soviet tanks and armoured trains joined in a renewed assault on the capital. While the armoured trains laid down suppressing fire, tanks and infantry penetrated the Georgian positions on the Kojori heights. On 24 February, the Georgian commander-in-chief, Giorgi Kvinitadze, bowed to the inevitable and ordered a withdrawal to save his army from complete encirclement and the city from destruction.
