It is that continuing influence, embodied in the magnificent series of films he has given the world, during the last half-century, that will preserve his great spirit, his humour and his wit, not only for us but for succeeding generations of film-goers.|$|E

She wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November of that year: [...] "Perhaps you will laugh when I say that the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment {{between me and the}} same fate." ...|$|E

500|$|After gaining {{significant}} notability in Europe, NSYNC {{was signed}} to American record label RCA in 1997. The group's first single, [...] "I Want You Back" [...] began receiving major radio {{play in the}} United States, and NSYNC soon found themselves becoming an [...] "overnight sensation", a period which Bass describes in his autobiography as [...] "the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own innocence". Along with increasing fame and recognition in the United States the band also experienced a highly publicized legal battle with Pearlman, due to what the group believed were illicit business practices on his part. NSYNC sued Pearlman and his record company, Trans Continental, for defrauding the group of more than 50% of their earnings, rather than his original promise of only receiving one-sixth of the profits. The group threatened to leave and sign with Jive Records, which prompted Pearlman and RCA to countersue NSYNC for $150 million US, citing breach of contract. The injunction {{was thrown out of}} court and, after winning back their earnings, NSYNC signed with Jive.|$|E

500|$|In 1891, {{after many}} failed {{attempts}} at reconciliation by the pair, Tom Chappell, the music publisher responsible for printing the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, {{stepped in to}} mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks had succeeded. [...] Two more operas resulted: Utopia, Limited (1893) and The Grand Duke (1896). Gilbert also offered a third libretto to Sullivan (His Excellency, 1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protegée from Utopia, led to Sullivan's refusal. Utopia, concerning an attempt to [...] "anglicise" [...] a south Pacific island kingdom, was only a modest success, and The Grand Duke, in which a theatrical troupe, {{by means of a}} [...] "statutory duel" [...] and a conspiracy, takes political control of a grand duchy, was an outright failure. After that, the partnership ended for good. Sullivan continued to compose comic opera with other librettists but died four years later. In 1904, Gilbert would write, [...] "...Savoy opera was snuffed out by the deplorable <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> distinguished collaborator, Sir Arthur Sullivan. When that event occurred, I saw no one with whom I felt that I could work with satisfaction and success, and so I discontinued to write libretti." ...|$|E
500|$|Virginia's {{death had}} a {{significant}} effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, [...] "the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him. He did not seem to care, after she was gone, whether he lived an hour, a day, a week or a year; she was his all." [...] A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, [...] "a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before", had fallen ill. While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers. Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it [...] "in the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> wife. This I can & do endure as becomes a manit was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair which I could not longer have endured without the total loss of reason".|$|E
500|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Lady Rosebery drove her husband to follow her own political agenda, or that of her family. For her the rewards seem to have been the pleasure of seeing a husband she undoubtedly adored in the high office of which she felt him worthy. There is no doubt that she tempered her husband's more radical views. Immediately following his wife's death Rosebery retired from politics, writing in October 1891 [...] "The sole object of my ambition has disappeared with the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> wife." [...] Proof of the widespread belief in society that Lady Rosebery was the stable element of the partnership was confirmed shortly after her death, by Queen Victoria, following a then rare public speech by Rosebery, in which he supported Home Rule for Ireland. The Queen was shocked and thought the speech [...] "almost communistic" [...] and went on to attribute Rosebery's [...] "shocking and disappointing" [...] behaviour to the fact that [...] "poor Lady Rosebery is not there to keep him back." [...] While Queen Victoria always personally liked Rosebery, she mistrusted his politics. The Queen had thoroughly liked Lady Rosebery and wrote Rosebery several letters of condolence, likening his loss to the untimely death of her own consort, Prince Albert. It seems that the Queen's antipathy to Jews was confined to elevating them to the peerage. This view had softened by 1885. In 1890 she accepted a luncheon invitation from Lady Rosebery's cousin Ferdinand de Rothschild and toured Waddesdon Manor albeit eating in a separate dining room to the Jewish members of the party.|$|E

2500|$|The year 1913 was for Bourguiba an {{important}} one: Working harder on his studies, he obtained his Certificat d'études primaires which dispensed him of military servitude {{by order of}} a beylical decree and to the grand relief of his father.

However, his joy did not last: On October 1, he went back to Tunis in order to start the year in Sadiki College but {{during the first week of}} November 1913, [...] "the superintendent called me out of class and announced me the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother", Bourguiba stated in 1973. [...] "I immediately returned to Monastir where I found my whole family surrounding my mother lying on the deathbed [...] The <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother had deeply shaken me.

As for him, no other event has been rougher that his mother's death: Neither his future remoteness in Bordj le Bœuf years later, nor his imprisonment in the Fort Saint-Nicolas in Marseille nor even his exile in Cairo.

This decision followed receipt by the magazine of a protest from Jean-Marc Varaut, prompted by publication in an earlier issue of a reference to Charles as [...] "head of the Imperial house". Point de Vue, which sometimes gazettes monarchist announcements, published Varaut's re-assertion of the dynastic exclusion of Charles along with the prince's response: [...] "...the title of 'head of family' among the Bonapartes devolves, at {{the death of the}} father, upon his eldest son. That rule is not susceptible to modification by the titleholder, a fortiori when the motives involved are petty and contrary to the Civil Code.

Beginning in the 1970s, Byrd explicitly renounced his earlier views favoring racial segregation. Byrd said that he regretted filibustering and voting against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and would change it if he had the opportunity. Byrd also said that his views changed dramatically after his teenage grandson was killed in a 1982 traffic accident, which put him in a deep emotional valley. [...] "The <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> grandson caused me to stop and think," [...] said Byrd, adding he came to realize [...] that African-Americans love their children as much as he does his. [...] During debate in 1983 over the passage of the law creating the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, Byrd grasped the symbolism of the day and its significance to his legacy, telling members of his staff [...] "I'm the only one in the Senate who must vote for this bill".|$|E
2500|$|... “It {{frequently}} {{happens that}} men {{bleed to death}} before assistance can be procured, or lose so much blood {{as not to be}} able to go through an operation. In order to prevent this, it has been proposed, and on some occasions practised, to make each man carry about him a garter, or piece of rope yarn, in order to bind up a limb in case of profuse bleeding. If it be objected, that this, from its solemnity may be apt to intimidate common men, officers at least should make use of some precaution, especially as many of them, and those of the highest rank, are stationed on the quarter deck, which is one of the most exposed situations, and far removed from the cockpit, where the surgeon and his assistants are placed. This was the cause of the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friend Captain Bayne, of the Alfred, who having had his knee so shattered with round shot that it was necessary to amputate the limb, expired under the operation, in consequence of the weakness induced by loss of blood in carrying him so far.
