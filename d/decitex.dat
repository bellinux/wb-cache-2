50|$|In Europe, textile {{engineers}} {{often use}} the unit tex, {{which is the}} weight in grams of a kilometre of yarn, or <b>decitex,</b> which is a finer measurement corresponding to the weight in grams of 10 km of yarn. Many other units have been used over time by different industries.|$|E
5000|$|Tex is {{a unit of}} {{measure for}} the linear mass density of fibers, yarns and thread and {{is defined as the}} mass in grams per 1000 meters.The unit code is [...] "tex". The most {{commonly}} used unit is actually the <b>decitex</b> (abbreviated dtex), which is the mass in grams per 10,000 meters. When measuring objects that consist of multiple fibers, the term [...] "filament tex" [...] is sometimes used, referring to the mass in grams per 1000 meters of a single filament.|$|E
40|$|A {{calculation}} {{equation of}} the fibre {{number on the}} cross-section of ring-spun yarn was de-duced theoretically and verified with test data of 20 representative pure cotton ring spun yarns. The equation is practical and convenient to use by substituting the yarn count, yarn twist, and fibre <b>decitex.</b> On {{the basis of the}} above equation, a yarn strength predication model was established. The revising functions of yarn count and twist to yarn strength were deduced in practical tests of the strength of 20 commonly used ring-spun yarns, and were used to revise the yarn strength predication model obtained. Substituting the fibre <b>decitex,</b> fibre strength, yarn count, yarn twist and yarn strength can be precisely calculated with this model. Key words: ring-spun yarn, yarn incross section, fibre number, yarn twist, yarn strength predication model. the fibre <b>decitex</b> Ndf in dtex, the yarn spe-cific density ρy in g/cm 3, the fibre specific density ρf in g/cm 3, fibre numbers in yarn cross section n, the following equations are established...|$|E
30|$|The {{effect of}} fibre linear density on water {{absorbency}} of test fabrics {{is presented in}} Fig.  7. Water absorbency was observed to increase {{with the increase in}} polyester fibre linear density for both carded (RC 3.3  > RC 2.2  > RC 1.5  > RC 1.3  > RC 1.1) and combed yarn fabrics (RM 3.3  > RM 2.2  > RM 1.5  > RM 1.3  > RM 1.1). Increase in water absorbency with fibre linear density may be attributed to corresponding increase in fabric thickness and fabric porosity (Table  4). For the same yarn fineness, as the fibre fineness decreases, the number of fibres in yarn cross-section decreases, which may result in increased yarn bulkiness and availability of high pore volume in yarn structure. Large pores or a high total pore volume assists in higher liquid volume retention, as suggested by Varshney et al. (2010). An increase in water absorbency of fabrics with increase in fibre linear density is therefore well justified in the light of above arguments. Combination of polyester fibre of higher <b>decitex</b> and carded yarn is seen to result in fabrics of higher water absorbency.|$|E
40|$|Myeloid sarcoma (chloroma, granulocytic sarcoma, or extramedullary myeloid tumour) is an extramedullary mass forming {{neoplasm}} {{composed of}} myeloid precursor cells. It is {{usually associated with}} myeloproliferative disorders but very rarely may precede the onset of leukemia. Here, we are presenting a rare case of primary vaginal myeloid sarcoma in a geriatric female patient without initial presentation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A 68 -year-old female patient with ECOG Performance Score of 1 presented with pervaginal bleeding for 20 days.

40|$|A wet {{spinning}} procedure {{was developed for}} the production of chitosan fibres. The dope was prepared by dissolving 5 % w/w medium grade chitosan in 2 % aqueous acetic acid; after filtration and degassing, fibres were produced by extrusion of the dope into an aqueous NaOH bath and further drawing, washing, drying and winding. The effect of changes in the spinning conditions on the properties of chitosan fibres was studied; it was found that spinning variables such as jet stretch ratio, draw ratio and coagulation bath concentration had little effect on the fibre properties, though higher draw ratios would be obtained at lower jet stretch ratios and slightly improved tenacities were obtained using more dilute NaOH solutions as the coagulant. The drying methods, however, had a big effect on the fibre properties; the fibres obtained by air drying had a much higher extensibility than those dried by radiant heating. The addition of i-propanol to the dope gave much whiter fibres while the addition of Na 2 S 04 to the coagulation bath produced the strongest fibres. Overall, the fibres produced in this work had tenacities between 0. 61 and 2. 48 g/dtex and extensibilities of 5. 7 to 19. 3 %, with individual fibre <b>decitex</b> ranging from 2. 5 to 7. 5. The fibres had round cross-sections and a smooth surface when dried with heating or a rough surface when dried with acetone. The chelating properties of the chitosan fibres were studied; it was found that upto 8 % Cu(II) and 5 % Zn(II) can be absorbed into the fibres within 40 minutes. The Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions had strong effects on the fibre tensile properties; both dry and wet strengths were remarkably increased with the absorption of metal ions. In addition, the fibres chelated with ZnS 04 had a LOI estimated to be 52 %. The chitosan fibres were acetylated using acetic anhydride in methanol. It was found that 88 % of the amine groups were acetylated within 30 minutes at 40 °C. The effects of temperature, time, ratio of anhydride to amine groups and the addition of water were studied; {{it was found that the}} addition of water to the methanol anhydride mixture greatly accelerated the reaction. Some O-acetylation was noticed in the reaction and this was removed by a treatment using 1 M aqueous NaOH. The changes in fibre properties after acetylation were also studied. It was found that after the acetylation process, the fibre had a better thermal stability and improved dry and wet strength. However, the fibre lost its chelating ability when substantially acetylated...|$|E
30|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} study the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort characteristics of woven and knitted fabrics. Varshney et al. (2010) studied the effect of fibre linear density on physiological properties of polyester woven fabrics and observed an increase in thermal resistance, trans planar wicking, air and water vapour permeability with fibre <b>decitex.</b> However they observed that thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and spreading speed of water drop decreased with increase in fibre coarseness. Das et al. (2008) reported reduction in air and water vapour permeability through the fabrics but increased wicking properties with the decrease in fibre diameter in their studies on micro-denier and normal denier filament fabrics. Ramakrishnan et al. (2009) compared the comfort properties of micro denier and normal denier viscose yarn knitted fabrics and observed better water absorbency and wicking for micro denier yarn knitted fabrics. Raj and Sreenivasan (2009) reported that the cotton fibre fineness had negative correlation with air permeability of fabrics woven from yarns having the same count and twist and suggested this outcome of reduced air spaces in the fabrics made from finer fibres. Oglakcioglu and Marmarali (2010) studied the effect of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of cotton knitted fabrics and observed that fabrics knitted with double plied yarn had higher thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and thermal resistance compared to single plied yarn fabrics. Singh and Nigam (2013) compared carded, combed and compact spun yarn woven fabrics for their comfort performance and reported that compact weft yarn fabrics showed high water vapour permeability while carded yarn fabrics showed higher thermal insulation. Ozdil et al. (2007) studied the thermal comfort properties of carded and combed yarn rib knitted fabrics and observed an increase in thermal conductivity and water vapour permeability of fabrics knitted with combed yarns. Nasrin and Nahida (2011) reported that combed yarns were stronger, less hairy and more uniform than carded yarns. Erdumlu and Saricam (2013) studied the wicking and drying properties of vortex spun yarns and knitted fabrics in comparison with ring-spun yarns and fabrics. They observed that vortex spun yarn had lower yarn and fabric wicking values and water absorbency rate than ring-spun yarns. Tyagi et al. (2009) studied the influence of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of woven fabrics and concluded that Murata Jet Spinning (MJS) yarn fabrics showed higher absorbency, air and water vapour permeability but lower wick ability compared to ring yarn fabrics. The review of published literature suggests that researches are mainly focused on studying the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort properties of woven and knitted fabrics. However, studies on the thermo-physiological properties of plated knits are very limited although the structures are fast becoming preferred choice as intimate wear owing to flexibility in engineering fabrics with different fibre and yarn combinations in the two distinct layers. Moreover, none of the reported studies suggest the desirable fibre and yarn combination in the two layers to engineer fabrics suited for particular environmental conditions. The present study was, therefore undertaken to explore the field further and {{to determine the effect}} of inner layer fibre linear density and the outer layer yarn type on thermo-physiological properties of plated knits.|$|E
