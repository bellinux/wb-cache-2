5|$|A {{few months}} later, United Diamond Fields of British Guiana was {{incorporated}} as a limited company. The company used Oppenheimer {{as a technical}} adviser, and immediately arranged to have its diamonds sold to the syndicate. The price was to be fixed for six months, with an auditor's certificate {{at the end of}} that time used to negotiate a new price. Oppenheimer was the only one with access to the accounting information, and the rest of the company had no way of checking that his figures were correct. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> frame, a new deposit of diamonds was discovered in South Africa, forcing the syndicate to acquire several million pounds worth of these new diamonds to prevent their control over the market being destroyed.

5|$|Although the {{hurricane}} season {{is defined as}} beginning on June1 and ending on November30, {{there have been several}} off-season storms. Since 1870, there have been 32 off-season cyclones, 18 of which occurred in May. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> span, nine storms formed in December, two in April, and one each in January, February and March. During four years (1887, 1953, 2003, and 2007), tropical cyclones formed in the North Atlantic Ocean both during or before May and during December. In 1887, four storms occurred outside the season, the most in a single year. High vertical wind shear and low sea surface temperatures generally preclude tropical cyclone formation during the off-season.|$|E

5|$|In {{the course}} of its breed surveys and monitoring, the Conservancy has found {{significant}} changes in the populations of several swine breeds. The Berkshire breed has increased significantly in number, partially due to international demand for its meat, while other breeds have shown significant decreases, most likely due to increasing consolidation of the pork industry to large producers who use only a few specialized pork strains. Breeds such as the Chester White and Poland China have seen population numbers reduced by over 25 percent between 1998 and 2003, while the Hampshire and Yorkshire breeds have decreased by more than 30 percent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} by football researchers that the playing of intercollegiate football began in November 1869, when a player at Rutgers University challenged another player at the nearby College of New Jersey (now Princeton). The contest more closely resembled soccer, with teams scoring by kicking a ball into the opponent's net, and lacked a uniform rules structure. The game developed slowly; the first rules were drafted in October 1873, and only consisted of twelve guidelines. Even though the number of teams participating in the sport increased, the game was still effectively controlled by the College of New Jersey, who claimed eight national championships in ten years. Only Yale presented any form of challenge, claiming four national championships <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> period.|$|E

5|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{testing of}} the rocket launchers {{took place at the}} end of 1938, when 233 rounds of various types were used. A salvo of rockets could completely straddle a target at a range of 5,500 metres (3.4mi).
