40|$|A system {{utilizing}} a digital computer for acquiring, storing and evaluating crystal images. The system includes {{a video camera}} (12) which produces a digital output signal representative of a crystal specimen positioned within its focal window (16). The digitized output from the camera (12) is then stored on data storage media (32) together with other parameters inputted by a technician and relevant to the crystal specimen. Preferably, the digitized images are stored on removable media (32) while the parameters for different crystal specimens are maintained in a database (40) with indices to the digitized optical images on the other data storage media (32). Computer software is then utilized to identify not only the presence and number of crystals and {{the edges of the}} crystal specimens from the optical image, but to also rate the crystal specimens by various parameters, such as <b>edge</b> <b>straightness,</b> polygon formation, aspect ratio, surface clarity, crystal cracks and other defects or lack thereof, and other parameters relevant {{to the quality of the}} crystals...|$|E

40|$|The {{segmentation}} of regions is {{an important}} first step for a variety of image analysis and visualization tasks. There is a wide range of image segmentation techniques in the literature. Conventional segmentation techniques for monochromatic images can be categorized into two distinct approaches. One is region based, which relies on the homogeneity of spatially localized features, whereas the other is based on boundary finding, using discontinuity measures. Based on one or both of these properties, diverse approaches to image segmentation exhibiting different characteristics have been suggested in the literature. [...] The research of this thesis was aimed at combining region growing and edge detection methods to provide better segmentation results. Existing schemes that use region-based processing provide unambiguous segmentation, but they often divide regions that are not clearly separated, while merging regions across a break in an otherwise strong edge. Edge-based schemes are subject to noise and global variation in the picture (e. g. illumination), but do reliably identify strong boundaries. The proposed combined algorithm begins by using region growing to produce an over-segmented image. This phase is fast (order N, where N is the number of pels in the image). The over-segmented output of the region growing is then modified using edge criteria such as edge strength, <b>edge</b> <b>straightness,</b> edge smoothness and edge continuity. Two techniques - line-segment subtraction and line-segment addition - have been investigated. In the subtraction technique, the weakest edge (based on a weighted combination of the criteria) is removed at each step. Every time that a weakest edge is removed, the combined edge strengths of the remaining edges are recalculated. In the addition technique, the strongest edge (based on the weighted combination of all criteria) of all the edges is calculated first. It is used to seed a multi-segment line that grows out from it at both ends. At each end of the strongest edge, a binary tree containing four branches is investigated. The adjoining edge that has the highest edge strength is appended to the seed. This process of appending continues until a closed loop or a boundary is reached. The overall procedure for both techniques for segmentation has been developed. [...] In order to investigate the performance of the proposed segmentation techniques, a segmentation evaluation method is demonstrated. Since a human is the ultimate judge, a subjective evaluation method is developed. Segmentation produced by a human is compared to segmentation produced by the algorithm and correlation is calculated between the human method and the algorithms. Subjective tests performed on the algorithms and the results confirm that the proposed algorithms can be used to produce better image segmentation than the segmentation produced by existing region-based techniques...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} tool conception for orthogonal turn milling shows a {{new approach}} for precision machining of rotational-symmetric work pieces. Tool parameters such as mill diameter and necessary cutting edge lengths are substantially for the minimization of the critical process dynamic. So a face milling process has been applied with a geometry-specific cutting strategy. This allows a machining process without a tangential or axial feed. The process dynamic and the resulting tool center point displacement related to the work piece surface could {{be reduced to a}} minimum using specific numbers of teeth and pre-machining technologies. Further highly accurate alignments of the cutting edges are elementary to ensure a minimum deviation of chip cross sections and therewith a minimum of process dynamic for the cutting edges. The inconstant tool wear behavior along the cutting <b>edge</b> influences the <b>straightness</b> of the work piece surface in addition to the tool Ã¢ work piece displacement caused by the process dynamic and the limited stiffness of the machine. The specific wear behavior and compensating cutting edge preparation methods to create straight cutting edges with inconstant radii are discussed...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{important}} variables {{in the design of}} the end cap calorimeter is the number of angular divisions that should be made in the face of the calorimeter array. While it would be ideal to have no such divisions, they are unavoidable because the maximum size for uranium sheets is less than the diameter of the array. These divisions create regions which are either partially or totally devoid of absorber and readout. It is the purpose of this note to analyze the effects of different parameters on the size of these cracks. This analysis assumes wedge shaped structures of significant depth (i. e. > 20 % of the total depth). For such modules there are five variables which affect the size of a crack. They are: (1) The clearance between modules. The extent to which the module wall and the array extend into this region depends on the tolerances on the manufacture of the module. All of the module construction techniques currently under consideration have very tight tolerances (e. g. 2 mils). Therefore, this region is assumed to be void of solid material. In the C. C this region is thought to be. 090 inches wide. (2) The thickness of the module walls. The wall thickness depends on which module is discussed. Design thicknesses range from. 078 inches in the C. C. modules to. 150 inches in the E. C leakage modules. Because tight tolerances are assumed on the construction of the modules the skin is assumed to be perfectly flat. (3) The dimension tolerance on the uranium width. The effect of the dimension tolerance varies depending on the location of the module. Modules near the a o'clock and 9 o'clock position will see a gray zone equal to the dimension tolerance at the top of each module. There will be a solid black zone at the bottom of each module. This results from gravity pulling the uranium plates down to touch the lower wall of the module. Modules near the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock region will see a gray zone equal to the dimension tolerance at both edges of a module since there are no plans for a mechanism to insure their alignment along one wall. (4) The straightness tolerance on the plate <b>edges.</b> The <b>straightness</b> tolerance creates a gray zone equal to its width along each side of a module. (5) The region of reduced signal pickup. The extent of this region is not yet well understood. The current design requires an area along the edge of the module which does not have resistive coat. The width of this region has not been determined. Some portion of this region should still collect all of the signal. The size of this region is not known, either. As an example we can use the tolerances currently achieved for the Harvard plates at Rocky Flats. The width tolerance requested was + 0. 000, - 0. 020 inches. Rocky Flats is delivering plates with a width tolerance of + 0. 000, - 0. 040 inch. There is no tolerance on the straightness of the datum edge. If we assume that. 010 inch of the. 040 inch tolerance is do to straightness variation then we can determine the crack sizes for a C. C. E. M. module...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{precision}} surgical knives is enormous. Currently, diamond knives {{have been the}} preferred choice among surgeons for use in precision surgeries, owing to the extreme hardness of diamond and the sharpness {{that can be achieved}} in single crystal diamond blades, but material and processing costs are high. Bulk metallic glass (BMG) {{has the potential to be}} an economically-viable material of similar performance for use in precision surgical knives. To this end, a novel hybrid manufacturing process integrating thermally-assisted micromolding and micro-drawing has been developed for producing BMG surgical-grade knife blade cutting edges with edge radii < 25 nm. A hybrid process testbed was designed and used to successfully run tests over a range of the key process variables. Three distinct deformation types were observed and were dependent on the balance between necking and elongation during drawing. The amount of necking and elongation was determined by the free volume behavior of bulk metallic glass and the formation of nano-crystals. Both these phenomena were found to be influenced by the atomic mobility of the material, which is based on both the material temperature and induced strain. A second generation hybrid manufacturing process and testbed were developed to improve blade <b>straightness,</b> <b>edge</b> radius and repeatability. The enhancements made included symmetric dies, an alignment flexure and force-limited drawing. Experimental results from the second generation process exhibited straight edges with less than 10 ??m of deviation across the blades 2 mm width and edge radii as low as 14 nm. Repeatability was also improved with all tests generating a viable cutting blade with comparable necking behavior, straight edges. Two processes were proposed to enable the manufacturing of multi-facet blades; a process based on forces generated by a magnetic field and a process based on multi-stage molding. Initial testing of the magnetic drawing process with a modified testbed revealed low forces relative to friction and inconsistent heating and it was concluded that magnetic drawing would not be able to produce meaningful results without major changes to the existing testbed. A review of previous research on tissue modeling and tissue cutting in terms of analyzing blade cutting performance was conducted. Based on this review, a testbed design and testing method was proposed with which to perform extensive analysis of blade cutting performance. The proposed method consisted of basic blade characterization, incision testing and wear resistance testing...|$|R
