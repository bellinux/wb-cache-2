40|$|Yarn {{construction}} {{is an important}} attribute in knitting and end use performance of knitwear. Holistically, yarn construction affects fabric thickness and weight, and thereby influences ultraviolet (UV) <b>protection</b> of <b>fabrics.</b> Although impact of yarn construction on UV <b>protection</b> of <b>fabrics</b> is apparent, {{there appears to be}} limited research on it. This paper studied the UV <b>protection</b> of plain-knitted <b>fabrics</b> made of three types of ring-spun cotton yarns varying in yarn twist level and staple length. The results show that these yarn properties affect UV <b>protection</b> of <b>fabrics</b> differently before and after laundering. The modified low-twisted yarn possesses a bulky feature which creates a porous fabric structure for more ultraviolet radiation (UVR) transmission. The extra-long staple yarn offers uniform fabric appearance for higher UVR reflection. However, the regularity of yarn also restricts the fabric shrinkage in laundering and thus improvement in UV protection by shrinkage is not as obvious as that provided by the conventional short-staple yarn.

With the view of practical application, the main factors affecting the light protection performance of an eye-patch protector, including the light transmission level of the fabric, the irradiance level, location of the light unit, the head directions of the infant, and the design components of eye-patch protectors, were examined in a simulated clinical environment of phototherapy light treatment. It was found that textile eye-patch protectors are able to shield the strong phototherapy light effectively. However, the light protection performance of the eye-patch protector is greatly affected by its fabrication {{and the level of}} the eye-patch displacement.

H 577 P ITC 2015 Wongxvii, 271 pages :illustrationsThe {{alarming}} {{increase of}} incidence {{of skin cancer}} has hastened the development and research of ultraviolet (UV) protective clothing. Although various fabric parameters that affect the ultraviolet radiation (UVR) transmission were studied by researchers, most of them focused on woven fabrics and chemical approaches for enhancing UV protection. Knitwear is an indispensable clothing in summer but there were few studies concerning knitted fabrics, in particular the influence of fabric constructions on ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) and structural properties. This thesis aimed at studying the UV protective property of knitted fabrics at a fundamental level by investigating the influence of different knit structures upon UPF with the three main knit stitches incorporated in the cotton knitted fabric constructions, namely, knit, tuck and miss stitches. The impacts of yarn characteristics, fabric constructions, coloration, end-use conditions including stretching, wetting and laundering, on UV protection were comprehensively studied. A metallic biaxial stretching equipment was specially developed {{for the evaluation of}} UV <b>protection</b> of <b>fabrics</b> in stretched condition. The results showed that fabrics with different knit structures have distinct performances in UV <b>protection.</b> A <b>fabric</b> with miss stitches offered remarkable UV <b>protection</b> whereas a <b>fabric</b> with tuck stitches exhibited poor UV protection. The colored knitted fabric with miss stitches imparted relatively better UV protection in a lighter color depth than the fabric with tuck stitches that were dyed in a darker shade. It infers the potential for reducing usage of dyestuffs and chemical auxiliaries in manufacturing UV protective clothing. Besides, knitted fabrics with miss stitches retained good UV protection under the stretched and wet conditions that simulating the daily wearing conditions of knitwear. The results of this study would provide value-added information to textile designers, manufacturers, and consumers for the enhancement of UV protection and selection of UV protective knitwear.

Clothing acting as a second skin for human beings provides a more durable protection against harmful UV radiation than sunscreen creams. The market value of UV-protective clothing is worth considering. This paper will provide important information to textile designers, manufacturers, and consumers about the production and selection of UV-protective knitwear. Although various factors that affect UV <b>protection</b> of <b>fabrics</b> have been studied by researchers, most of them focused on woven fabrics and chemical approaches for improving UV protection. Knitwear {{in the form of}} daily wear is an indispensable form of clothing in summer but there has been limited research concerning the UV-protective properties of weft-knitted fabrics to date, in particular the influence of fabric construction on UV protection factor (UPF) and fabric structural properties. This issue of Textile Progress reviews the major factors that affect UV <b>protection</b> by <b>fabrics,</b> including fibre types, yarn characteristics, fabric construction, colouration, chemical additives, wetness (rather than just the moisture absorbed into the fibres), the stretching that may occur in clothing, and the effects of laundering. Methods for evaluating the UV-protective ability of fabrics are also addressed.

30|$|Detailed {{knowledge}} of the properties of cotton, including its features and benefits, is critical for students who study apparel and textiles. Understanding the needs and interests of a specific target market whose fiber preferences may be determined by functional and aesthetic requirements that have both similarities to and differences from their own is essential for students {{who want to work}} in the apparel and textile industries. The ability to apply this understanding to the selection of specific textiles for the development of apparel targeted to a specific market is even more essential. Throughout this project, all fashion design and merchandising students were required to apply everything they learned in earlier courses to the product development process. Thus, they experienced real-world work in the development of tennis wear prototypes for mature women by working with real-world clients. Throughout this activity, from selecting cotton fibers to developing prototypes of their tennis wear, students continuously focused on the clothing needs of female baby boomer tennis consumers and the ability of cotton to fulfill those needs. In addition, because students were required to become familiar with the benefits of cotton throughout this project, they were encouraged to use cotton in their future designs. High performance fabrics such as TransDry and UV ray <b>protection</b> <b>fabrics</b> are recommended by this study to enhance the quality of clothing performance for tennis participants. This research project could be extended to other activities (e.g., biking, hiking, fitness, and well-being) that baby boomers are engaged with because they are still active and able to enjoy their vivacious life. Moreover, industry partnerships to manufacture actual clothing products through similar projects targeted at baby boomers would be valuable. The overall project contributed to meeting the goal to promote innovative teaching strategies that offer students educational opportunities that will help them live, work, compete, and prosper in a global community.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of coloration on ultraviolet (UV) protection of cotton knitted fabrics with different knit structures incorporated {{with the three}} major stitch types, namely knit, tuck and miss stitches, are studied in four approaches. The effects of color depth and knit structures on the ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) of fabrics are investigated. The influences of hue and color depth on the UPF of fabrics are also compared. Since UV protection offered by dyes mainly depends on their chemical structures, the UPF and color strength of fabrics colored by reactive dyes that varied in reactive groups, such as mono-functional and bi-functional reactive dyes, are examined. The correlations between UPF and the CIELAB color coordinates, color strength (K/Ssum), are analyzed. The results show that light-colored fabrics with compact structures achieve similar or even better UV protection than the dark-colored fabrics with loose structures. This implies that color property {{might not be a}} reliable indicator for UV <b>protection</b> of knitted <b>fabrics</b> and the effect of coloration on UV protection is affected by fabric construction. The results also denote that the chemical structure of reactive dyes affects the UV <b>protection</b> of <b>fabrics</b> in a qualitative approach that depends on the unique ultraviolet radiation blocking ability of the chemical constituents. Among the color coordinates investigated, only lightness (L*) and K/Ssum are found to be correlated with the UPF of the fabrics, but the strength of correlations is not very strong. This is because the fabric characteristics that have significant impacts of UV protection are mostly not involved in the measurement of color properties. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
