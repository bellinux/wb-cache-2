Six minute video (detail from installation, [...] "Invisible Fire")Uranium Decay (2012), draws {{attention}} to the dark, inverse form of alchemy of the Atomic Age. Responding to the ongoing Fukushima meltdowns the video illuminates the 4.47 billion-year half-life <b>decay</b> <b>cycle</b> of uranium-238 superimposed onto thermographs and news footage. As uranium decays over geological time, it transmutes into “uranium daughters” that cascade into other elements and finally to stable Lead-206. As we are learning post-Fukushima, when climate change occurs and vulnerability spectrums shift, nuclear sites and the life forms surrounding them are at increased risk.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Quantum Rabbit (QR) {{research}} on the low-energy fusion and fission (low-energy nuclear reactions, or LENR) of various elements indicates possible pathways for applying that process to reducing nuclear materials. In a New Energy Foundation (NEF) -funded test conducted at Quantum Rabbit lab in Owls Head, Maine, QR researchers initiated a possible low-energy fission reaction in which 204 Pb fissioned into 7 Li and 197 Au (204 Pb → 7 Li + 197 Au). 1 This reaction may have been triggered by a low-energy fusion reaction in which 7 Li fused with 32 S to form 39 K (7 Li + 32 S → 19 K). These results confirmed earlier findings showing apparent low-energy fusion and fission reactions. 2 Moreover, subsequent research with boron indicates apparent low-energy fusion reactions in which boron fuses with oxygen to form aluminum and with sulfur to form scandium. 3 At the same time, the QR group has achieved {{what appear to be}} low-energy transmutations of carbon using carbon-arc under vacuum and in open air. 4 The research group at QR believes these processes can be adapted to accelerate the natural <b>decay</b> <b>cycle</b> of uranium- 235, plutonium- 239, radium- 226 and the fission products cesium- 137, iodine- 129, technetium- 99 and strontium- 90 with the long-term potential of reducing the threat posed by radioactive isotopes to human health and the environment.

40|$|Native {{forest in}} central Chile has been {{increasingly}} replaced by exotic forest plantations. In particular, saproxylic beetles could be highly sensitive to exotic forest plantations {{due to the}} clear-cutting management decreases deadwood accumulation while promoting the incompleteness of the <b>decay</b> <b>cycle.</b> We assessed the diversity and density of saproxylic beetle species at two spatial levels (habitat and microhabitat) and compared them among native Maulino forest (Native), Blue-gum eucalyptus plantations (Eucalyptus) and Monterrey pine plantations (Pine). We sampled for adult beetles at 972 logs and stumps. Although exotic plantations and Native had relatively similar amounts of deadwood, beetle species were less diverse and abundant in exotic plantations. Such a decreased density and diversity of saproxylic beetles in plantations depended on the substrate type (logs or stamps), decay stage of wood and trophic level. With the exception of Polyphagous, the richness of all species and trophic guilds decreased in forest plantations, with Eucalyptus supporting the lowest density and richness. The microclimate and the toxic leaf litter in Eucalyptus probably caused the woody biomass to be unsuitable for beetles. Although the guilds of late-successional species were underrepresented in Pine, our results provide the first evidence that saproxylic beetles benefit from exotic woody debris available in Chilean pine plantations. An increased beetle density at expenses of reduced species richness in Pine indicates that ecosystem services provided by saproxylic beetles are not limited in Pine. We suggest the conservation of saproxylic beetles in Pine plantations involves the retention of woody debris along the management cycle.

40|$|According to {{previous}} studies, pCO 2 fluxes measured over Arctic sea ice {{are higher than}} those measured over Antarctic sea ice. We hypothesized that {{this was due to}} enhanced respiration in Arctic sea ice, as a consequence of higher riverine inputs of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into Arctic seawater. We tested this hypothesis during the Interice V experiment at the HSVA (Hamburg) environmental test basin facility. We reproduced the growth and <b>decay</b> <b>cycle</b> of sea ice in replicate mesocosms (1 m 3) filled with North Sea water (NSW series), and compared these with another series of mesocosms to which humic-rich river water had been added (10 %) to increase the DOC concentration (R series). Primary producers were excluded from the experiment. The evolution of the temperature, salinity, DOC, pCO 2 and bacterial biomass and production were measured in ice sampled at regular intervals throughout the experiment, {{as well as in the}} under-ice water. In addition, ice-air pCO 2 fluxes were continuously monitored over both NSW and R mesocosms. pCO 2 values in ice were higher in the R ice than in the NSW ice. This is attributed to the DOC content and bacterial respiration, rather than to the ice physical properties (i. e., ice permeability constrained by the ice temperature and salinity). Indeed, R ice had higher DOC content and bacterial production than the NSW ice while both showed similar physical properties. The evolution of the ice-air pCO 2 fluxes was consistent with the evolution of pCO 2 in ice. The fluxes were, as expected, positive (from sea ice to the atmosphere) during ice growth and negative (from the atmosphere to the ice) during ice melt...|$|E

The collected events are divided into two groups as (i) solar cycle rise phase events and (ii) solar <b>cycle</b> <b>decay</b> phase events. The properties of CMEs in the two groups were compared and the results are presented. It is noted that there is no difference in the properties of type II burst like start frequency and end frequency between the solar cycle rise phase events and decay phase events. The mean CME speed of solar <b>cycle</b> <b>decay</b> phase events (1373 [*]km[*]s− 1) is slightly higher than the solar cycle rise phase events (1058 [*]km[*]s− 1).

40|$|International audienceThe {{nonlinear}} Schrodinger equation, {{who is one}} of {{the most}} significant equations in physics, may model accurately the propagation of nonlinear waves. Some nonlinear waves are known to be unstable to side-band perturbation. This instability, known as the Benjamin-Feir [1] instability or Modulation Instability (MI) in a broader context, can be described by exact pulsating solutions, also referred to as Akhmediev Breathers (ABs). These solutions are of significant importance, since they describe the exact and complete growth and <b>decay</b> <b>cycles</b> of the modulation instability, leading to the Fermi Pasta Ulam [2] (FPU) recurrence.

40|$|A set of {{large-scale}} laboratory experiments {{were conducted to}} study channel meander migration. Factors affecting the migration of banklines, including the ratio of curvature to channel width, bend angle, and the Froude number were tested in the experiments. The effect of each factor {{on the evolution of}} channel plan form was evaluated and quantified. The channel bankline displacement was modeled by a hyperbolic function with the inclusion of an initial migration rate and a maximum migration distance. It is found that both the initial migration rate and maximum migration distance exhibit a Gaussian distribution along a channel bend. Correlations between the distributions and the controlling parameters were then studied. Two sets of equations were developed for predicting the initial migration rate and the maximum migration distance. With the initial migration rate and maximum migration distance being developed as a function of geometric and flow parameters, a hyperbolic-function model can be applied to estimate the bankline migration distance. The prediction of channel centerline migration was also developed in this study. The channel centerline was represented with a combination of several circular curves and straight lines. Each curve with the radius of curvature and bend angle was used to describe the channel bend geometry. HEC-RAS was applied to estimate the flow hydraulic properties along the channel by adjusting the channel bed slope. The intersections of two consecutive centerlines were found to be the inflection points of the centerline migration rate. Phase lag to the bend entrance was measured and correlated with the bend length and water depth. The migration rate between two successive inflection points demonstrated a growth and <b>decay</b> <b>cycle.</b> A sine function was used to model the centerline migration rate with regression analysis of the measurement data. The method was applied to four sites of four natural rivers in Texas. The results showed that the prediction equation provides agreeable results to the centerline migration of natural rivers...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} Antarctic Climate Research (ACR) program, {{a two-year}} study of atmosphere/sea-ice/ocean {{interaction}} was conducted off Queen Maud-Enderby Lands, Antarctica in 1990 and 1991. Research on the spatial characteristics of snow depth and sea-ice thickness and of the growth processes of sea ice {{was carried out in}} Lutzow-Holm Bay. The lengths of snow stakes, snow depths and sea-ice thicknesses were all measured at ten offshore stations on two latitudinal lines in April, August and October of both years. Sea ice cores were also collected to assess structure, temperature and salinity in 1991. Spatial variations of snow depth and sea ice thickness were clearly noticed. The stations near the Antarctic Continent have little snow cover. However, the snow depth increased consistently with distance from the Continent, reaching a nearly constant maximum value of 1 to 1. 5 m during the winter. The increase of ice thickness paralleled that of snow depth, the maximum thickness at the offshore stations being 2 to 3 m. No differences in these variations were recognized between the two observation lines. The snow depth was found to significantly affect the sea-ice growth processes. At the station with little snow cover, the sea ice grew in the austral winter months and decayed in summer to the thickness of the previous year. The sea ice repeats this growth and <b>decay</b> <b>cycle</b> annually and consequently is limited in thickness to approximately 2 m. On the contrary, in the heavily snow-covered regions, the sea ice showed little growth even in the winter, because the thick snow cover and sea ice itself reduced the vertical heat flux and accordingly the growth rate due to bottom freezing. In summer, however, an extreme increase of sea ice thickness of 0. 5 to 1 m was observed. The growth is probably caused by refreezing of low-salinity meltwater from the snow cover. An aquifer about 0. 2 m deep was found to exist on the snow/ice interface in January 1992. This fact suggests that the sea ice growth {{can be attributed to the}} formation of superimposed ice...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2003 Simulations {{performed}} by a 3 D cloud-resolving model are used to study the transport of tropospheric tracers into the lowermost stratosphere via midlatitude convection. Direct transport by convection {{is believed to be}} the most likely mechanism by which short-lived chemical species can be transported from the boundary layer to the stratosphere. In the few works that have included analysis of cross-tropopause transport due to deep midlatitude convection, the tropopause is defined by a single altitude or pressure level, but the tropopause location is unclear in the highly perturbed environment directly above an active storm. Thus, to determine the irreversibility of cross-tropopause transport, ten-hour simulations are carried out to cover the growth and <b>decay</b> <b>cycles</b> of the storm. After the decay of convection, isentropes relax to quasi-flat surfaces, allowing more confident tropopause location. At 1 km above the tropopause, the concentration of the tracer originating in the layer between 1 and 4 km has a maximum of 23 % of its original concentration; the concentration of the tracer originating below 1 km has maximum of 26 % of its original concentration. Increasing the altitude of the level of neutral buoyancy in model soundings and adding upper level wind shear are both found to produce more transport into the stratosphere. Supercell storms produce more transport when compared with multicell storms...|$|R

40|$|The Sea of the Hebrides is an island-studded {{region of}} complex {{bathymetry}} on the UK continental shelf, {{west of the}} Scottish mainland. An extensive area (2200 km 2) of recently collected multibeam bathymetry data, combined with seismic reflection profiles reveal {{this part of the}} shelf to have been extensively modified by both glacial and modern processes. Our new geomorphological evidence strongly supports the contention that an ice stream drained ice from western Scotland and the Inner Hebrides towards the Barra Fan at the continental shelf break {{at the height of the}} last glaciation (Marine Isotope Stage 2 – 3). Convergent seabed glacial lineations and other subglacially streamlined features eroded in bedrock around the Islands of Canna and Rum preserve the direction of ice sheet movement, and strongly suggest the onset of ice streaming in a southwesterly direction on the continental shelf in the Sea of the Hebrides region. This fast-flow zone formed part of a larger convergent ice stream system draining much of western Scotland and the north of Ireland — the southern part of which has been postulated already. A number of rock basins, linear troughs and deeps west and south of Muck, kept sediment-free by the dominant modern tidal regime, are interpreted as being at least partly subglacial in origin. Similarly, a large complex of buried deeps between Eigg and Arisaig are interpreted as an overdeepened glacial drainage network. It is suggested that intense bedrock erosion by focused subglacial abrasion and subglacial meltwater discharge over multiple glacial advance and <b>decay</b> <b>cycles</b> led to significant modifications of the pre-Quaternary bedrock surface. Other features such as moraines are only found in shallower water (typically < 50 m), west of Canna, west of Rum and south of Skye.

Even though the cathode based on 4. 9 nm catalyst exhibited the highest initial electrochemical surface area (ECA) and mass activity, the cathode based on 8. 1 nm catalyst showed better initial performance at high currents. Owing {{to the low}} mass activity of the large particles, the initial performance of the 14. 8 nm Pt 3 Co-based electrode was the lowest. The performance decay rate of the electrodes with the smallest Pt 3 Co particle size was the highest {{and that of the}} largest Pt 3 Co particle size was lowest. Interestingly, with increasing number of <b>decay</b> <b>cycles</b> (0. 6 to 1. 0 V, 50 mV/s), the relative improvement in performance of the cathode based on 8. 1 nm Pt 3 Co over the 4. 9 nm Pt 3 Co increased, owing to better stability of the 8. 1 nm catalyst. The electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) of the decayed membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) showed that the amount of Co in the membrane was lower for the larger particles, and the platinum loss into the membrane also decreased with increasing particle size. This suggests that the higher initial performance at high currents with 8. 1 nm Pt 3 Co could be due to lower contamination of the ionomer in the electrode.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from July 15, 2016 - July 15, 2017 As the effect of ocean acidification (OA) on marine calcifiers is better understood, a range of potential mitigative strategies have been proposed, {{many of which are}} plagued by concerns of scale and feasibility. One oft-cited option is to increase the biomass of photosynthetic organisms to remove CO₂ from the water column and facilitate organic carbon burial. Seagrasses show much promise in this regard, owing to their highly refractive tissue. Timescales of carbon burial with respect to this strategy are on the order of years to decades. Recent studies, however, demonstrate that some marine bivalves experience short windows of heightened sensitivity to OA, especially during the early larval and early post-metamorphic “juvenile” stages, which occur on timescales of hours to days. In coastal areas, carbonate chemistry is highly variable on similar timescales, due in part to photosynthetic cycles, the pattern and magnitude of which will vary due to the ecological make-up of the habitat. Therefore, we must consider the highly complex and variable nature of CO₂ dynamics in seagrass habitats on short timescales when we consider their potential role in OA mitigation. We examined patterns of growth and survival in the juvenile Pacific Oyster (Crassostrea gigas) outplanted within and outside beds of two different species of seagrass, the native Zostera marina and the non-native Z. japonica, in Netarts Bay, Oregon. Z. marina and Z. japonica differ in the timing and magnitude of their growth and <b>decay</b> <b>cycles</b> and allocation of biomass above or below ground. Z. marina increased both growth and survival of C. gigas spat with the magnitude of the effects decreasing after mid-season as seagrass growth slows and there is a transition to an upwelling-dominant hydrodynamic regime. Z. japonica appeared to have a slightly negative, but not statistically significant, effect on juvenile C. gigas growth, compared to the associated bare-sand control site, with the notable exception of a reversal of the trend in June, co-incident with this seagrass’s short period of growth. We have compared bivalve success metrics (growth and survival) with P[subscript CO 2] measurements within each habitat. Patterns in bivalve success metrics appear to inversely correlate with trends in daily CO₂ minima {{over the course of the}} season, suggesting that bivalve success may be attributed to compensatory growth during daily low-CO₂ periods associated with the seagrass’s respective growing seasons...|$|R

Using daily Greenwich sunspot areas, we calculated the Neumann and Pearson chi-squared distances between CDs as indices showing the direction of coupling. We introduce an additional index of synchronization which shows the strength of coupling and allows us to discriminate between complete synchronization and independency of hemispheres. All indices are evaluated in a four-year moving window showing the evolution of coupling between hemispheres. We find that the driver-response interrelation changes between hemispheres have a few pulses during 130 years of Greenwich data with an at least 40 years-long period of unidirectional coupling. These sharp nearly simultaneous pulses of all causality indices are found at the decay of some 11 -year cycles. The pulse rate of this new phenomenon of dynamic coupling is irregular: although the first two pulses repeat after 22 -year Hale cycles, the last two pulses repeat after three and four 11 -year cycles respectively. The last pulse occurs at the <b>decay</b> phase of <b>Cycle</b> 23 so the next pulse will likely appear during the <b>decay</b> of future <b>Cycle</b> 25 or later. This new phenomenon of dynamic coupling reveals additional constraints for understanding and modeling of the long-term solar activity cycles...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a facile synthesis of micrometer-sized porous Si particles via copper-assisted chemical etching process. Subsequently, metal and/or metal silicide layers are introduced {{on the surface}} of porous Si particles using a simple chemical reduction process. Macroporous Si and metal/metal silicide-coated Si electrodes exhibit a high initial Coulombic efficiency of similar to 90 %. Reversible capacity of carbon-coated porous Si gradually <b>decays</b> after 80 <b>cycles,</b> while metal/metal silicide-coated porous Si electrodes show significantly improved cycling performance even after 100 cycles with a reversible capacity of > 1500 mAh g(- 1). We confirm that a stable solid-electrolyte interface layer is formed on metal/metal silicide-coated porous Si electrodes during cycling, leading to a highly stable cycling performance. close 2...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{were taken}} with weakly superconducting quantum {{structures}} of the Notarys-Mercereau type, representing a thin superconductor film with a short region that is weakened {{in the sense that}} its transition temperature is lower than in the remaining portion of the film. The structure acts as a superconducting relaxation oscillator in which the supercurrent increases with time until the critical current of the weakened section is attained, at which moment the supercurrent <b>decays</b> and the <b>cycle</b> repeats. Under applied radiation, a series of constant-voltage steps appears in the current-voltage curve, {{and the size of the}} steps varies periodically with the amplitude of applied radiation. Measurements of the response characteristics were made in the frequency range of 10 to 450 MHz...|$|R
40|$|In the orbifold {{limit of}} K 3, one can give exact {{conformal}} field theory description of D-branes wrapped on certain non-supersymmetric cycles of K 3. We study {{the effect of}} switching on the `non-geometric blow up modes' corresponding to anti-symmetric tensor gauge field flux through the 2 -cycles on these D-branes. Working to first order in the blow up parameter, we determine {{the region of the}} moduli space in which these D-branes are stable. Across the boundary of this region, the D-brane wrapped on the non-supersymmetric <b>cycle</b> <b>decays</b> to a pair of D-branes, each wrapped on a supersymmetric cycle, via a second order phase transition.

40|$|Selenium sulfide/double-layered hollow carbon sphere (SeS/DLHC) {{composites}} {{have been}} designed as high-performance cathode materials for novel Li–SeS batteries. In the constructed composite, SeS is predominantly encapsulated in the interlayer space of DLHCs with a high loading of 75 % (weight percentage) and serves as the active component for lithium storage. The presence of Se in the composite and the carbon framework not only alleviate the shuttling of polysulfide, but also improve the conductivity of electrodes. Migration of active materials from the interlayer void to the hollow cavity of DLHCs after cycling, which further mitigates the loss of active materials and the shuttle effect, is observed. As a result, the SeS/DLHC composite delivers a high specific capacity (930 mA·h·g at 0. 2 C) and outstanding rate capability (400 mA·h·g at 6 C), which {{is much better than}} those of SeS/single-layered hollow carbon sphere, Se/DLHC, and S/DLHC composites. Notably, the SeS/DLHC composite shows an ultralong cycle life with 89 % capacity retention over 900 cycles at 1 C, or only 0. 012 % capacity <b>decay</b> per <b>cycle.</b> Our study reveals that both SeS and the double-layered structures are responsible for the excellent electrochemical performance.
