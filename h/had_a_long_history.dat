5|$|Bennett {{declined}} the offer to be Dole's running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Dole's antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential , running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp {{was seen as}} a means to attract conservative and libertarian-minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan. Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack, John McCain, and Carroll Campbell, and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole's senior advisors. Dole had <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemp's tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket. When Kemp became Dole's running mate in 1996, they appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 19, 1996 issue of Time magazine, but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars, which was so close to being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.|$|E

5|$|Eureka Stockade, 3 December – The Eureka Stockade on 3 December has <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> as an {{alternative}} choice for Australia Day, having been proposed by The Bulletin in the 1880s. The Eureka uprising occurred in 1854 during the Victorian gold rush, and saw a failed rebellion by the miners against the Victorian colonial government. Although the rebellion was crushed, it led to significant reforms, and {{has been described as}} being the birthplace of Australian democracy. Supporters of the date have included senator Don Chipp and former Victorian Premier Steve Bracks. However, the idea has been opposed by both hard-left unions and right-wing nationalist groups, both of whom claim symbolic attachment to the event, and by some who see it as an essentially Victorian event.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{southern}} cities at the time, Chicago did not segregate {{most public}} accommodations. According to Walter Francis White of the NAACP, pre-1915 Chicago {{had a good}} reputation for equitable treatment of African Americans. However, unofficially, early 20th-century Chicago beaches were racially segregated. African Americans <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>history</b> in Chicago, the city sending its first African-American representative to the state legislature in 1876. However, the black population in 1900 was only about 1 percent, while it expanded dramatically {{in the early years}} of the century. Most Irish Americans and African Americans competed for low-end jobs, causing tension between the groups.|$|E

Although the highlight of Cappon's tenure as coach was a 16–4 (9–3) third place 1936–37 Big Ten finish, he coached John Townsend who in his 1937–38 senior season became last All-American for at least 10 years. The team finished third in two other seasons with less impressive records of 10–8 overall (8–4, Big Ten) in 1932–33 and 15–5 overall (7–5, Big Ten) 1935–36, and Cappon's overall record was 78–57 overall (44–40, Big Ten).
