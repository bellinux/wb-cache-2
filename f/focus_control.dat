25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{invention}} of his revolutionary illumination scheme as {{a graduate student at the}} University of Giessen, Köhler was working on overcoming problems with microphotography. Microscopes were illuminated by gas lamps, mirrors or other primitive light sources, resulting in an uneven specimen illumination unsuited for producing good quality photomicrographs using the slow-speed emulsions available at the time. Over the course of his work for his doctorate degree, Köhler developed a microscope configuration that allowed for an evenly illuminated field of view and reduced optical glare from the light source. It involved a collector lens for the lamp that allowed the light source to be focused on the front aperture of the condenser. This in turn allowed the condenser to be focused on the specimen using a field diaphragm and condenser <b>focus</b> <b>control.</b> This superior illumination scheme is still widely used in modern microscopes and forms the basis for phase contrast, differential interference contrast, epifluorescence, and confocal microscopy.|$|E

5000|$|Early work on opto-mechanical methods {{was done}} by Martin Wright. [...] Opto-mechanical {{spectacles}} allow <b>focus</b> <b>control</b> by the wearer via movement of a small slider located {{on top of the}} bridge. The user adjusts the lens for optical clarity at the desired distance. [...] They are a combination of rigid and flexible lenses that can change prescription to enable sharp focus at different distances (from infinity up to 13"). The appropriate addition range depends on the user’s level of refractive error. A tiny mechanism, actuated by the slider, simultaneously controls both flexible lenses to assure appropriate near vision tracking in both eyes.|$|E

50|$|A third {{theory is}} that the {{information}} required to determine the distance to and velocity of an object in object space is determined by the lateral geniculate nucleus before the information is projected to the visual cortex.

50|$|Management is {{responsible}} for internal control, which comprises five critical components: the control environment; risk assessment; risk <b>focused</b> <b>control</b> activities; information and communication; and monitoring activities.

Internal auditors perform audits to evaluate whether the five components of management control are present and operating effectively, and if not, provide recommendations for improvement.|$|R
50|$|F-mount lenses lock {{by turning}} {{counter-clockwise}} (when {{looking at the}} front of lens) and unlock clockwise. Nearly all F-mount lenses have zoom and <b>focus</b> <b>controls</b> that rotate in the clockwise direction (as viewed from behind the camera) to increase focal length and focus distance respectively. This convention is also used in Pentax K-mount and Sony A-mount lenses but is opposite of the direction normally used by Canon. F-mount lenses also typically have aperture rings that turn clockwise to close.|$|R
