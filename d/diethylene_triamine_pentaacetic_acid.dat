500|$|... 225Ac {{is applied}} in {{medicine}} to produce 213 in a reusable generator {{or can be}} used alone as an agent for radiation therapy, in particular targeted alpha therapy (TAT). This isotope has a half-life of 10 days that makes it much more suitable for radiation therapy than 213Bi (half-life 46 minutes). Not only 225Ac itself, but also its daughters, emit alpha particles which kill cancer cells in the body. The major difficulty with application of 225Ac was that intravenous injection of simple actinium complexes resulted in their accumulation in the bones and liver {{for a period of}} tens of years. As a result, after the cancer cells were quickly killed by alpha particles from 225Ac, the radiation from the actinium and its daughters might induce new mutations. To solve this problem, 225Ac was bound to a chelating agent, such as citrate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or <b>diethylene</b> <b>triamine</b> <b>pentaacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DTPA). This reduced actinium accumulation in the bones, but the excretion from the body remained slow. Much better results were obtained with such chelating agents as HEHA(1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaazacyclohexadecane-N,N',N'`,N'``,N'``',N'``'`-hexaacetic acid) or DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) coupled to trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that interferes with the HER2/neu receptor. The latter delivery combination was tested on mice and proved to be effective against leukemia, lymphoma, breast, ovarian, neuroblastoma and prostate cancers.|$|E

Technetium (99 mTc) -diethylene <b>triamine</b> <b>pentaacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DTPA) hydrated clearance studies are accurate for determining GFR but require special facilities for handling and measuring samples. We investigated {{the potential of}} a non-radioactive paramagnetic analog, Gadolinium (Gd) -diethylene <b>triamine</b> <b>pentaacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DTPA), an approved NMR contrast agent, as a glomerular filtration marker. Instead of relying on the radioactivity of technetium, this test {{is based on the}} fact that gadolinium induces alterations in the NMR Tl relaxation times in blood and urine samples. Ninety patients underwent simultaneous determinations of GFR using 1 mCi of Tc-DTPA and 0. 05 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA (Berlex Labs) IV. The patients were hydrated with oral and intravenous fluid. Following a one hour equilibrium period, three or four consecutive urine collections were obtained; plasma samples were acquired at the beginning and end of each approximately 20 -minute interval. 99 mTc-DTPA radioactivity was determined with a scintillation counter. Tl relaxation times were measured on a 10 MHz NMR spectrometer. These were converted to Gd-DTPA concentration by comparison with standard solutions. The Gd-DTPA derived GFR closely approximated the 99 mTc-DTPA derived GFR which ranged from 15 to 147 ml/min. The equation and correlation coefficient of the regression line is y = 1. 04 × - 2. 2, r = 0. 94.

30|$|We {{hypothesize that}} for {{liposomal}} therapies, tumor deposition is highly variable and a rate-limiting step for effective drug delivery and anti-tumor activity [8]. The {{extent to which}} liposomes accumulate within tumors is governed by the inherent tumor physiology, {{as well as the}} size and surface characteristics of the liposomes. Vascular permeability is highly variable between different tumor types, among patients with the same type of tumor, and between distinct tumors within an individual subject. Using 111 In-diethylene <b>triamine</b> <b>pentaacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DTPA)-labeled PEGylated liposomes, Harrington et al. demonstrated that liposome deposition varied from undetectable to 53 % ID/kg in patients [9]. Moreover, liposomal tumor deposition has been identified as a rate-limiting step for drug delivery to tumor cells, supporting the theory that deposition variability may directly result in differential therapeutic response [8]. Correspondingly, Arrieta et al. demonstrated that increased deposition of 99 mTc-labeled PLD predicted response of mesothelioma patients treated with PLD and cisplatin [10]. This is further supported by preclinical studies showing a direct correlation between variable liposome deposition in rat xenograft models and tumor response to PLD [11]. These results suggest that identification of patients exhibiting increased tumor deposition may improve response to nanotherapeutics.|$|R

40|$|High {{frequency}} {{jet ventilation}} (HFJV) {{is known to}} deliver continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and opens atelectatic lung units. Ad-equate oxygenation and elimination of carbon dioxide may be maintained with tidal volumes less than the anatomical deadspace in animals and patients with respiratory failure [1, 2]. There is evidence that damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane {{is a consequence of}} large intra-pulmonary pressure-volume excursions [3]. Re-peated closing and reopening of the alveoli especially may lead to damage of the alveolar-capillary membrane because of high shear forces [4, 5]. It is assumed that HFJV reduces pul-monary damage by keeping the lung inflated and avoiding shear forces. The amplitudes of the pressure excursions during HFJV are known to be related inversely to the frequency used.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We utilized a randomized, cross-over study design where participants were studied after 2 weeks of activation or inactivation of vagal nerve blockade (VNB). Seven obese subjects with impaired fasting glucose previously enrolled in a long-term study to examine the effect of VNB on weight took part. We used a standardized triple-tracer mixed meal to enable measurement of the rate of meal appearance, endogenous glucose production, and glucose disappearance. The 550 kcal meal was also labeled with (111) In-diethylene <b>triamine</b> <b>pentaacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DTPA) to measure gastrointestinal transit. Insulin action and beta-cell responsivity indices were estimated using the minimal model. RESULTS: Integrated glucose, insulin, and glucagon concentrations did not differ between study days.

Furthermore, fasting and postprandial endogenous glucose production, integrated meal appearance, and glucose disposal did not differ in {{the presence or absence of}} VNB. Similarly, gastric emptying and colonic transit were unchanged by VNB. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study in nondiabetic humans, electrical vagal blockade had no acute effects on glucose metabolism, insulin secretion and action, or gastric emptying. It remains to be determined if more pronounced effects would be observed in diabetic subjects...|$|R
40|$|Lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) are {{semi-rigid}} spherical capsules with a triglyceride core {{that present}} a promising formulation {{option for the}} pulmonary delivery of drugs with poor aqueous solubility. Whilst the biodistribution of LNCs of different size has been studied following intravenous administration, the fate of LNCs following pulmonary delivery has not been reported. We investigated quantitatively whether lung inflammation affects the clearance of 50 nm lipid nanocapsules, or is exacerbated by their pulmonary administration. Studies were conducted in mice with lipopolysaccharide-induced lung inflammation compared to healthy controls. Particle deposition and nanocapsule clearance kinetics were measured by single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging over 48 h. A significantly lower lung dose of (111) In-LNC 50 was achieved in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -treated animals compared with healthy controls (p< 0. 001). When normalised to the delivered lung dose, the clearance kinetics of (111) In-LNC 50 from the lungs fit a first order model with an elimination half-life of 10. 5 ± 0. 9 h (R(2) = 0. 995) and 10. 6 ± 0. 3 h (R(2) = 1. 000) for healthy and inflamed lungs respectively (n= 3). In contrast, (111) In-diethylene <b>triamine</b> <b>pentaacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DTPA), a small hydrophilic molecule, was cleared rapidly from the lungs {{with the majority of}} the dose absorbed within 20 min of administration. Biodistribution to lungs, stomach-intestine, liver, trachea-throat and blood {{at the end of the}} imaging period was unaltered by lung inflammation. This study demonstrated that lung clearance and whole body distribution of lipid nanocapsules were unaffected by the presence of acute lung inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Glomerular {{filtration}} rate (GFR) was evaluated in 32 Wilms’ tumour survivors (WTs) in a cross-sectional study using 99 Tc-diethylene <b>triamine</b> <b>pentaacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (99 Tc-DTPA) clearance, the Schwartz formula, the new Schwartz equation for {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD), cystatin C serum concentration and the Filler formula. Kidney damage was established by beta- 2 -microglobulin (B- 2 -M) and albumin urine excretion, urine sediment and ultrasound examination. Blood pressure was measured. No {{differences were found between}} the mean GFR in 99 Tc-DTPA and the new Schwartz equation for CKD (91. 8 [*]±[*] 11. 3 vs. 94. 3 [*]±[*] 10. 2  ml/min/ 1. 73  m 2 [p[*]=[*] 0. 55] respectively). No differences were observed between estimated glomerular {{filtration rate}} (eGFR) using the Schwartz formula and the Filler formula either (122. 3 [*]±[*] 19. 9 vs. 129. 8 [*]±[*] 23. 9  ml/min/ 1. 73  m 2 [p[*]=[*] 0. 28] respectively). Increased urine albumin and B- 2 -M excretion, which are signs of kidney damage, were found in 7 (22 %) and 3 (9. 4 %) WTs respectively. Ultrasound signs of kidney damage were found in 14 patients (43 %). Five patients (15. 6 %) had more than one sign of kidney damage. Eighteen individuals (56. 25 %) had CKD stage I (10 with signs of kidney damage; 8 without). Fourteen individuals (43. 75 %) had CKD stage II (6 with signs of kidney damage; 8 without). The new Schwartz equation for CKD better estimated GFR in comparison to the Schwartz formula and the Filler formula. Furthermore, the WT survivors had signs of kidney damage despite the fact that GFR was not decreased below 90  ml/min/ 1. 73  m 2 with 99 Tc- DTPA...|$|R
