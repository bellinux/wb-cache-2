40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of the Preparation <b>for</b> <b>Adult</b> Living skills training program by measuring the learning gains and learning outcomes of students participating in the training. The quasi-experimental posttest control group design was used. A treatment sample of twelve students received the Preparation <b>for</b> <b>Adult</b> Living training. A nontreatment sample was selected by matching the characteristics of educational and reading level and the gender of twelve students with no previous independent living skills training with those of the treatment sample. Students in the treatment sample were tested for learning gains using the Preparation <b>for</b> <b>Adult</b> Living Test. Both the treatment and nontreatment sample were tested using the post-training Preparation <b>for</b> <b>Adult</b> Living Scale to determine the level of their learning outcomes. The Preparation <b>for</b> <b>Adult</b> Living Test results were analyzed using the t-test for correlated samples of pretests and posttests. The t-test for independent samples was used to analyze the Preparation <b>for</b> <b>Adult</b> Living Scale results to determine the students' learning outcomes. A Pearson r correlation coefficient was calculated <b>for</b> Preparation <b>for</b> <b>Adult</b> Living Scale scores to determine if a relationship existed between employment and the life coping skills of the treatment sample. The findings indicated that no learning gains were made during the training, but that the training had an impact on the students' post-training life-coping skills. A strong relationship was found between the specific life-coping and employment skills of the treatment sample.
