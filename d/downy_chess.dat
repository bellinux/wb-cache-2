40|$|Natural {{ecosystems}} in the semiarid West face many stressors. Among {{the most}} challenging are those associated with invasive plant species. One invader that has had great impact over the last 100 years is the annual grass known as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). A few years ago, I made two observations that both confirmed and broadened my perception of this plant. In the first, I saw it growing on sodden roofs in an historic community near the Mississippi River. I was reminded that the scientific name roughly means “brome grass that grows on roofs ” and I gained insight into its long coexistence with humans. Later that day I observed a plant growing in the mud {{on the bank of}} the river. I pondered about what that place could possibly have in common with the vast shrublands of the semiarid West where cheatgrass has become so entrenched. Recently I found plants growing directly from the smallest of cracks in massive limestone slabs in the deserts of western Utah (Fig. 1). Reflexively I pondered, “Is there any place on earth cheatgrass cannot grow?” Bromus tectorum, cheatgrass, downy brome, <b>downy</b> <b>chess,</b> early chess, drooping brome, June grass, bronco grass, 100...|$|E
40|$|During {{the late}} summer of 1998 {{extensive}} areas (Fig. 4. 21 - 1 and 4. 21 - 2) of dense cheatgrass or <b>downy</b> <b>chess</b> (Bromus tectorum L.) were reported in the Cedar Grove area of Kings Canyon (Fig. 4. 21 - 3). Employees and repeat visitors had commented on the substantial increase in extent and density of cheatgrass during the El Niño winter of 1997 / 1998. Because of the highly invasive nature of this species and its documented expansion in relation to fire (Young and Evens 1973; Pellant 1990;Whisenant 1990; Billings 1994; Monsen 1994; Young and Allen 1997), there was immediate alarm about its presence and abundance. Park managers were concerned that burning these dense patches or nearby areas would provide more disturbance which would promote its success and spread as documented elsewhere. Autumn burning on the valley floor of Cedar Grove was suspended until {{an evaluation of the}} situation was conducted. A field survey to document distribution and density of the species was conducted in the fall of 1998 along with several other types of preliminary or background sampling. Figure 4. 21 - 2.

Atrazine applications in September would be most effective on the newly germinated weeds. Use 1 to 2 pints of atrazine or AAtrex 4 L or equivalent amounts of other atrazine formulations. Bluegrass and intermediate wheatgrass may be injured by the treatments. Aerial or ground applications can be made. According to the label, livestock should not be grazed for 7 months after making fall treatments. Musk Thistle Control October and early November are excellent times to control musk thistle providing the weather cooperates. A good fall control program normally {{eliminates the need for}} spring control. This is because plants that would flower next summer are normally growing in the fall. However, the success of a fall control program depends on adequate fall rainfall. Dry weather reduces musk thistle seed germination and plant establishment. Where the weather has been dry, there may be no plants to control. Examine the site and determine if the thistle population justifies spraying. Herbicides and per acre rates to use on musk thistle are Tordon 22 K at 6 to 8 fluid ounces, 2, 4 -D + Banvel at 1. 0 lb + 0. 5 pt, and 2, 4 - 0 at 1. 5 to 2. 0 lb. These treatments are ranked in order of effectiveness for fall application. Under very dry, cool conditions only Tordon can be expected to perform well. Treatments should be applied after October 1. Field Bindweed and Other Perennials Perennial weeds including field bindweed, Canada thistle, and others can {{be effectively}} treated with herbicides in the fall. Food storage in the root system of these plants is taking place in the fall. Herbicides applied at this time to plants with excellent top growth readily move down to the roots along with the food. In the fall, temperatures and soil moisture are generally more favorable for plant growth than during the summer, a condition required for best herbicide performance. Leafy Spurge Control Special attention should be given to the control of leafy spurge during the fall. Research has shown more consistent control of leafy spurge with fall herbicide treatments compared to spring applications...|$|R
