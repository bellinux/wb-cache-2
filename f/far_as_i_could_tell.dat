2500|$|... 'The Christmas Tree' was {{supposed}} to {{have something to do with}} playing colors by light, but it was totally random as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> just absurd. -- Bruce Conner ...|$|E
60|$|Jabez's {{calculations}} {{could not}} have been far out, for it was just midnight, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> when we saw a flash right ahead.|$|E
60|$|So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> {{the night}} passed quietly. The next morning I heard that my {{mistress}} was suffering so severely from a nervous attack {{that she was}} unable to rise from her bed. It was no surprise to me to be told that, knowing as I did what she had gone through the night before.|$|E
60|$|As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see {{she danced}} with Mr. Parry pretty well all the time.|$|R
60|$|I {{bent over}} and felt his pulse. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make out, it still beat feebly.|$|R
6000|$|The old {{man took}} us to the inn which he recommended, and we found it was the Angel. It was a nice, old-fashioned, queer English house. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see, they was all women that managed it, and it couldn't have been managed better; and <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see, we was the only guests, unless there was [...] "commercial gents," [...] who took {{themselves}} away without our seeing them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Joan, I {{tell you}} it was a {{magnificent}} bluff," [...] went on Jim, excitedly. [...] "And it worked. Kells walked away amid cheers. He meant to give an impression of character and importance. He succeeded. So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> there wasn't a man present who did not show admiration for him. I saw that dead gambler kicked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{very sad}} affair." [...] Greythorpe mused. [...] "A {{promising}} career cut short {{and a life}} ruined by a moment's failure of nerve. The price paid for it was a heavy one. Still, I found the matter difficult to understand, because, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> {{there was nothing in}} Blake's character that made such a failure possible. Then it's known that personal courage was always a characteristic of your family." ...|$|E
6000|$|One day {{shortly after}} I had arrived I had an {{interesting}} visit, for de Souza, wishing to have an argument brought Mr. Grobelaar to see me. This gentleman was the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and {{had just returned from}} Mafeking, whither he had been conducting a 6-inch gun. He was a very well-educated person, and so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> honest and capable besides. With him came Reuter's Agent, Mr. Mackay, and the odious Malan. I received them sitting on my bed in the dormitory, and when they had lighted cigars, of which I always kept a stock, we had a regular durbar. I began: ...|$|E
60|$|The two villains began {{whispering}} together, debating, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear, {{which was}} the best way of avoiding my vedettes.|$|R
60|$|I yielded {{myself to}} the guiding hand, and shortly found myself, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see, at {{one side of the}} sanctuary.|$|R
60|$|She read it, in {{the same}} stately and impassive way,--untouched by its contents, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see,--and {{returned}} it to him.|$|R
60|$|Her {{face was}} almost entirely turned from me; but I knew {{her by her}} dress, by her figure--even by her {{position}}, simple as it was. She was sitting with her hands on a closed book which rested on her knee. A little spaniel that I had given her lay asleep at her feet: {{she seemed to be}} looking down at the animal, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> by the position of her head. When I moved aside, to try if I could see her face, the trees hid her from sight. I was obliged to be satisfied with the little I could discern of her, through the one gap in the foliage which gave me {{a clear view of the}} place where she was sitting. To speak to her, to risk the misery to both of us of saying farewell, was more than I dared trust myself to do. I could only stand silent, and look at her--it might be for the last time!--until the tears gathered in my eyes, so that I could see nothing more. I resisted the temptation to dash them away. While they still hid her from me--while I could not see her again, if I would--I turned from the garden view, and left the Square.|$|E
60|$|How I {{got through}} the rest of the day I know not. I tried hard not to create any {{domestic}} trouble by my manner, lest Aunt Janet should, after her lurid dream or vision of last night, attach some new importance to it. I think I succeeded, for she did not, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> take any special notice of me. We parted as usual at half-past ten, and I came here and made this entry in my journal. I am more restless than ever to-night, and no wonder. I would give anything to be able to pay a visit to St. Sava's, and see my wife again--if it were only sleeping in her tomb. But I dare not do even that, lest she should come to see me here, and I should miss her. So I have done what I can. The glass door to the Terrace is open, so that she can enter at once if she comes. The fire is lit, and the room is warm. There is food ready in case she should care for it. I have plenty of light in the room, so that through the aperture where I have not fully drawn the curtain there may be light to guide her.|$|E
60|$|Then I braced myself {{again to}} my horrid task, and found by {{wrenching}} away tomb tops one {{other of the}} sisters, the other dark one. I dared not pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should begin to be enthrall. But I go on searching until, presently, I find in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather {{herself out of the}} atoms of the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul wail of my dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears. And, before the spell could be wrought further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had searched all the tombs in the chapel, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> And as there had been only three of these Undead phantoms around us in the night, I took it that there were no more of active Undead existent. There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest. Huge it was, and nobly proportioned. On it was but one word.|$|E
60|$|And I {{repeated}} {{word for}} word what Lorenzo had said to me, and, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> reproduced his accent and gesture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, ma'am, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see {{him well}} enough. He was talkin' an' laughin', <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make out, with an {{uncommon}} pretty girl." ...|$|R
60|$|During my stay {{upon the}} island, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see, {{there was little}} to denote that any change had taken place in the government.|$|R
60|$|The {{long day}} reached its close at last. The western clouds flushed into fire; {{the shadows of}} the hills {{stretched}} out across the valley. A ponderous Boer waggon, with its long team, crawled slowly along the track towards the town. The Kaffirs collected their herds and drew around their kraal. The daylight died, and soon it was quite dark. Then, and not till then, I set forth, I hurried to the railway line, pausing on my way to drink at a stream of sweet, cold water. I waited for some time {{at the top of the}} steep gradient in the hope of catching a train. But none came, and I gradually guessed, and I have since found that I guessed right, that the train I had already travelled in was the only one that ran at night. At last I resolved to walk on, and make, at any rate, twenty miles of my journey. I walked for about six hours. How far I travelled I do not know, but I do not think that it was very many miles in the direct line. Every bridge was guarded by armed men; every few miles were gangers' huts; at intervals there were stations with villages clustering round them. All the veldt was bathed in the bright rays of the full moon, and to avoid these dangerous places I had to make wide circuits and often to creep along the ground. Leaving the railroad I fell into bogs and swamps, and brushed through high grass dripping with dew, so that I was drenched to the waist. I had been able to take little exercise during my month's imprisonment, and I was soon tired out with walking, as well as from want of food and sleep. I felt very miserable when I looked around and saw here and there the lights of houses, and thought of the warmth and comfort within them, but knew that they only meant danger to me. After six or seven hours of walking I thought it unwise to go further lest I should exhaust myself, so I lay down in a ditch to sleep. I was nearly at the end of my tether. Nevertheless, by the will of God, I was enabled to sustain myself during the next few days, obtaining food at great risk here and there, resting in concealment by day and walking only at night. On the fifth day I was beyond Middelburg, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> for I dared not inquire nor as yet approach the stations near enough to read the names. In a secure hiding-place I waited for a suitable train, knowing that there is a through service between Middelburg and Louren√ßo Marques.|$|E

5000|$|... "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> he was happy," [...] said fellow Cracked artist Dan Clowes. [...] "I dont {{think he}} ever {{seemed to notice}} that Mad was respected, whereas Cracked was loathed." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Sparrow {{came up from}} behind, {{over the}} roof. He was {{carrying}} a piece of yellow-fluff, part of a lamp-shade, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> judge.|$|R
6000|$|... 'One--so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see--was of the Duke of Orleans' liberty,' said Malcolm. 'The other--pardon me, Sir--it {{bore the}} names of Duke Humfrey and Countess Jaqueline.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The London Cheesecake is {{a pastry}} {{confection}} that contains no cheese. It {{was described by}} Will Self in The Unbearable Lightness of Being a Prawn Cracker as [...] "...not cake at all but rather a square of puff pastry...while so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> there wasn't any cheese incorporated into this sweetmeat, which instead was garnished with some coconut or mallow shavings." ...|$|E
5000|$|Naughton {{first saw}} Super Size Me {{as part of}} his {{research}} into a comedy piece he was working on about prejudice against fat people, saying, [...] "I watched Super Size Me as part of my research. But the premise and the rather large gaps in logic annoyed me so much, I decided I needed to create a reply. I know some other filmmakers went on McDiets and documented how they lost weight, but as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> they weren't funny. If it's true what Mencken said, that the cure for contempt is counter-contempt, then the cure for a funny documentary that's full of bologna is a funny documentary that isn't." ...|$|E
5000|$|Von Neumann {{was also}} noted for his eidetic memory (sometimes called {{photographic}} memory). Herman Goldstine wrote: [...] One of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> von Neumann was able on once {{reading a book}} or article to quote it back verbatim; moreover, {{he could do it}} years later without hesitation. He could also translate it at no diminution in speed from its original language into English. On one occasion I tested his ability by asking him to tell me how A Tale of Two Cities started. Whereupon, without any pause, he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{people leave}} {{a good deal}} to the imagination, but, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{understand}} him, he gave you a hint or two. What's his business?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not definitely," [...] he replied. [...] "So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{make out}} {{from what the}} {{sergeant}} said, it was keeping bad company as much as anything." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, Seth Freedman {{wrote in}} The Guardian {{that after a}} day touring with ICAHD, while the {{visitors}} [...] "had not been fed any factual inaccuracies ICAHD as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> the complete glossing over {{of the other side}} of the story should set alarm bells ringing". Freedman felt that Halper and ICAHD should have been willing to condemn wrongdoing [...] "on both sides". Freedman changed his mind about ICAHD in 2008, and wrote in The Guardian that [...] "the likes of Halper, ICAHD and all the others who are prepared to bring the truth into open should be praised to the skies for the invaluable work that they do." [...] The article rues the fact that Freedman himself earlier condemned ICAHD and its work.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the account}} of Sir Hussey Vivian {{recorded}} by Henry Curling in 1847: Just after the Surgeon had taken off the Marquis of Anglesey's leg, Sir Hussey Vivian came into the cottage where the operation was performed. [...] "Ah, Vivian!" [...] said the wounded noble, [...] "I {{want you to do}} me a favour. Some of my friends here seem to think I might have kept that leg on. Just go and cast your eye upon it, {{and tell me what you}} think." [...] "I went, accordingly", said Sir Hussey, [...] "and, taking up the lacerated limb, carefully examined it, and so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> it was completely spoiled for work. A rusty grape-shot had gone through and shattered the bones all to pieces. I therefore returned to the Marquis and told him he could set his mind quite at rest, as his leg, in my opinion, was better off than on." ...|$|E
5000|$|TB to DS so {{what did}} you do? Well I wrote a {{masterpiece}} to the RFL Chairman at Chappeltown Rd Mr David Oxley asking him if the time was not right now for the development of League in SA given the IRB sanction of a world 15 to play against the Springboks at Ellis Park - Mr Oxley replied [...] "...sport and politics are inextricably mixed, and to ignore one without the other is simply to bury ones head in the sand..." [...] So {{what are you going to}} do now Dave? Well not quite sure at the moment. TB-Why don't we do it ourselves? What? Start League in SA? DS-Yeah I'm up for that how should we start? TB-I'm actually going to the UK for a month when I'm back why don't we get together and talk?(This sounded like a cooling off period for me DS to forget about the idea as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell)</b> Tony gave me his tel number and I duly phoned him in Jan 89 as arranged. Tony needed to be prompted as to who I was and what we had agreed but we set a meeting up to discuss. I was playing RU for Old Edwardians (Old Eds) at the time in a suburb of Jhb called Houghton. My connections were good with the coaching staff and as luck would have it one of the coaches Gary Lewis had a brother in law called Ray Mordt the ex Wigan winger from the 80's.|$|E
6000|$|Though I {{shall not}} urge it <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> will venture {{to say the}} {{argument}} {{is at least as}} strong the other way--considering the judges.-- ...|$|R
60|$|RANKIN. That is so. (Drinkwater slaps {{his knee}} triumphantly. The missionary {{proceeds}} determinedly) And the someone was a verra honest, straightforward man, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> judge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Festing, with grim quietness. [...] "I {{imagine it}} has done all the damage that was possible. So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see, the crop's wiped out." ...|$|R
