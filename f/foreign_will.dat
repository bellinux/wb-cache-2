Suddenly Mackintosh grew conscious that the boy's eyes were resting on the revolver which he had laid on the desk when Manuma appeared in the doorway. There was a silence between the two which to Mackintosh was endless. He seemed to read the thoughts which were in the Kanaka's mind. His heart beat violently. And then he felt as though something possessed him so that he acted under the compulsion of a <b>foreign</b> <b>will.</b> Himself did not make the movements of his body, but a power that was strange to him. His throat was suddenly dry, and he put his hand to it mechanically in order to help his speech. He was impelled to avoid Manuma's eyes.|$|E
60|$|In {{the course}} of another {{fortnight}} I had seen sufficient of Frances Evans Henri, to enable me to form a more definite opinion of her character. I found her possessed in a somewhat remarkable degree {{of at least two}} good points, viz., perseverance and a sense of duty; I found she was really capable of applying to study, of contending with difficulties. At first I offered her the same help which I had always found it necessary to confer on the others; I began with unloosing for her each knotty point, but I soon discovered that such help was regarded by my new pupil as degrading; she recoiled from it with a certain proud impatience. Hereupon I appointed her long lessons, and left her to solve alone any perplexities they might present. She set to the task with serious ardour, and having quickly accomplished one labour, eagerly demanded more. So much for her perseverance; as to her sense of duty, it evinced itself thus: she liked to learn, but hated to teach; her progress as a pupil depended upon herself, and I saw that on herself she could calculate with certainty; her success as a teacher rested partly, perhaps chiefly, upon the will of others; it cost her a most painful effort to enter into conflict with this <b>foreign</b> <b>will,</b> to endeavour to bend it into subjection to her own; for in what regarded people in general the action of her will was impeded by many scruples; it was as unembarrassed as strong where her own affairs were concerned, and to it she could at any time subject her inclination, if that inclination went counter to her convictions of right; yet when called upon to wrestle with the propensities, the habits, the faults of others, of children especially, who are deaf to reason, and, for the most part, insensate to persuasion, her will sometimes almost refused to act; then came in the sense of duty, and forced the reluctant will into operation. A wasteful expense of energy and labour was frequently the consequence; Frances toiled for and with her pupils like a drudge, but it was long ere her conscientious exertions were rewarded by anything like docility on their part, because they saw that they had power over her, inasmuch as by resisting her painful attempts to convince, persuade, control--by forcing her to the employment of coercive measures--they could inflict upon her exquisite suffering. Human beings--human children especially--seldom deny themselves the pleasure of exercising a power which they are conscious of possessing, even though that power consist only in a capacity to make others wretched; a pupil whose sensations are duller than those of his instructor, while his nerves are tougher and his bodily strength perhaps greater, has an immense advantage over that instructor, and he will generally use it relentlessly, because the very young, very healthy, very thoughtless, know neither how to sympathize nor how to spare. Frances, I fear, suffered much; a continual weight seemed to oppress her spirits; I have said she did not live in the house, and whether in her own abode, wherever that might be, she wore the same preoccupied, unsmiling, sorrowfully resolved air that always shaded her features under the roof of Mdlle. Reuter, I could not tell.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{textbooks}} {{to give a}} real, historical {{picture of}} events, not the myth, were published in Austria only in 1982 and 1983. Authors {{for the first time}} discussed the problem of anti-Semitism in their contemporary society and were first to admit that Hitlerite anti-Semitism had national, Austrian roots. The other textbooks of 1980s continued to diligently reproduce the [...] "victim" [...] myth. They mentioned the existence of the concentration camps, but their description was reduced to just a political prosecution of a political enemies of Hitler; the books considered the camps as a place where consolidation of the national elite has happened, a personnel department of the Second Republic in its own way. The Holocaust was mentioned but was never classified as genocide; there were no absolute figures of exterminated people: Austrian school invented the [...] "Holocaust without Jews". Only in 1990s authors of textbook admitted the real scale of the crimes, but kept the comparsion of the Holocaust with Hiroshima. The two catastrophes still co-existed and were continuously compared, and Austrians who have done evil still were presented as passive executors of the <b>foreign</b> <b>will.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{growth in}} {{multinational}} corporations looking {{to expand and}} invest in foreign countries, particularly in the emerging markets such as Africa, has grown tremendously. “Africa is already the world’s second fastest growing economy after expanding 5 % {{a year in the}} past two years, well above the global average. ” (World Economic Forum, 2013). This has resulted in the movement of human capital between different tax jurisdictions and an increase in expatriates all across the world. The focus of the study is to expand on the current knowledge on the taxation of inbound expatriates working within South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Nigeria, as the world has turned its focus on Africa in terms of investment and expansion, as supported by Shelley (2004 : 3), and to provide both employers and employees with knowledge of the different tax regimes (source-based taxation and residence-based taxation) found in some of the emerging and fastest growing markets in Africa: namely Botswana, Namibia, Nigeria and South Africa. It was found that the African tax landscape provides for a vast range of tax systems, of which, most are either residence–based or source-based. The tax systems of South Africa and Nigeria are similar in that they are residence-based. In each of these two countries, tax residents are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-residents are only taxed on income from specific sources. Therefore, residency is an essential concept in each of these tax systems. The above-mentioned countries, however, apply different methods and factors in determining the concept of residency. As a result of the difference in determining tax residency and differences in their domestic income tax legislations, the taxability of income earned abroad differs in these countries. The tax systems of Botswana and Namibia are similar in that they are source-based. In each of these countries, income is taxable when it is from a source or deemed source within these countries. Although in exceptional circumstances, some income which is not from a source within these countries may be taxable, relief is applied in terms of the domestic legislation, in order to lessen the burden of tax. Source is therefore a vital concept in each of these tax systems. The definition and application of the term source is different in both countries. However, similarities are found in that the source is primarily where the services were physically rendered. Both employers and employees should consider the basis of taxation (source basis and residence basis) that is applied by the prospective host country when making a decision regarding an assignment to a foreign country as this forms a major factor in how their income (both local and <b>foreign)</b> <b>will</b> be treated.
