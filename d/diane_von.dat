5|$|In its series premiere, The City first {{introduces}} Whitney Port, {{who moved}} from Los Angeles, California to New York City, New York to begin employment for fashion designer <b>Diane</b> <b>von</b> Fürstenberg. She reunited with her friend Erin Lucas and love interest Jay Lyon, and befriended co-worker Olivia Palermo against her companions' advice. Port became irritated the feelings Lyon had for his ex-girlfriend Danielle and his unwillingness to commit to a relationship, and eventually severed ties with him. Lyon's distaste for his housemate Adam Senn's girlfriend Allie Crandell ultimately ruined their friendship, while Senn and Crandell's relationship was strained by rumors of his alleged infidelity. Lucas' long-distance boyfriend Duncan Davies, who lived in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, broke up with Lucas after discovering that she had become friendly with her ex-boyfriend JR.

25|$|Schiaparelli {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{designers}} to develop the wrap dress, taking inspiration from aprons to produce a design that would accommodate and flatter all female body types. Her design, which first appeared in 1930, offered a two-sided model with armholes on each side, brought together in the front of the garment and wrapped and tied at the waistline. Buttons may also have been incorporated into this early version. Initially conceived as beachwear and produced in four colours of tussore silk, the dress was popular with buyers and copied by garment manufacturers as a design for everyday street wear. Some forty years afterwards, this uncomplicated and easy-to-wear design was revisited in the 1970s by the American designer <b>Diane</b> <b>von</b> Fürstenberg.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{production}} {{of the second half}} of the season, Lucas, Lyon, and Senn departed from the series. Port also left her position at <b>Diane</b> <b>von</b> Fürstenberg and resumed working at her previous employer Kelly Cutrone's PR firm People's Revolution. As the season resumed, Port's friend Roxy Olin was introduced as a new main cast member, and was hired at People's Revolution. Palermo had left <b>Diane</b> <b>von</b> Fürstenberg for a position with Elle, where she clashed with co-worker and new main cast member Erin Kaplan. With Cutrone's guidance, Port begins designing a fashion line, while Kaplan becomes increasingly displeased with Palermo's under-performance. Port also began dating friend Freddie Fackelmayer, but was dismayed to learn that he had a girlfriend. By the season finale, Port had presented the [...] "Whitney Eve" [...] lookbook to Bergdorf Goodman, and decided to further publicize her collection through a fashion show at Bryant Park.|$|E
500|$|However, during {{production}} of The City, Port wanted to feature her private life {{to emphasize that}} [...] " [...] head is still screwed on straight". During {{the first half of}} the debut season, the program highlighted her transition to New York City after receiving employment from <b>Diane</b> <b>von</b> Fürstenberg. However, Port later left her position and returned to People's Revolution with Kelly Cutrone.|$|E
500|$|Throughout its run, {{the series}} was led by three (season 5) and four (seasons 1–4, 6) primary cast members, who were {{credited}} by their first names. Its original main cast members were Conrad, Heidi Montag, Audrina Patridge, and Whitney Port. Upon {{the conclusion of the}} fourth season, Port moved to New York City after receiving employment with <b>Diane</b> <b>von</b> Fürstenberg and was commissioned to star in the spin-off The City.|$|E
500|$|The City {{was often}} criticized for {{appearing}} to fabricate {{much of its}} storyline. In one instance, <b>Diane</b> <b>von</b> Fürstenberg workers were reportedly angered that Port [...] "doesn't really work" [...] and was [...] "hardly ever in the office", elaborating that series producers would inhibit normal work operations by not allowing employees to move items in their offices. Freddie Fackelmayer, Port's former love interest, commented that the network [...] "never asked the cast to say or do anything", though the editing that followed portrayed him as a [...] "womanizing jerk".|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Maya Lieberman {{attempted to}} contrast the costumes of Sharon and Lisa {{to reinforce the}} conflict between the two characters. She said, [...] "With Ali, our discussion started with wanting really clean, classic and sharp lines, whereas Beyoncé's character [...] more soft, more textural cashmeres and knits." [...] Sharon wore clothes designed by Zac Posen, Yves Saint Laurent, Jimmy Choo, <b>Diane</b> <b>von</b> Fürstenberg, Valentino, Stella McCartney and Missoni, while Lisa wore Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana and Burberry outfits. Derek was dressed in Dolce & Gabbana and Versace suits with Thomas Pink shirts to create a [...] "prestigious yet contemporary" [...] look.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, {{the reality}} {{television}} series [...] premiered on MTV. The program {{was created by}} Liz Gateley and documented the lives of several students attending Laguna Beach High School as they completed secondary education. The series proved among the network's most successful programming, though the entire original cast left after the second season and were replaced by another group of teenagers for the following season. Television producer Adam DiVello developed the spin-off program The Hills to follow one of its predecessor's original cast members Lauren Conrad as she moved to Los Angeles {{to pursue a career}} in the fashion industry. After The Hills itself became similarly successful, DiVello developed The City upon the conclusion of the parent series' fourth season, which saw one of its primary cast members Whitney Port move to New York City to begin employment with <b>Diane</b> <b>von</b> Fürstenberg.|$|E
500|$|Among the {{original}} designer tenants were <b>Diane</b> <b>von</b> Fürstenberg, Joan Leslie and Jerry Silverman. The top ten floors are {{occupied by a}} Holiday Inn hotel, [...] which incorporated 527 rooms in its original design. In the early 1980s, The New York Times included the hotel among city's first-class hotels. [...] NBC was a tenant until it moved to the NBC Tower in 1989. At {{about the same time}} that NBC moved out, both Quaker Oats and World Book moved out of their Mart facilities. [...] The Chicago Transit Authority, which had been a tenant of the Merchandise Mart since 1947, had facilities in the building until it decided to build its own dedicated building in 2002. Illinois Bell moved into the Apparel Center in 1990. The Chicago Sun-Times moved its headquarters to the building in 2004.|$|E
500|$|On October 7, 2016, {{construction}} {{started on}} a new Statue of Liberty museum on Liberty Island.

The original torch will be relocated here, and in addition to exhibits relating to the statue's construction and history, there will be a theater where visitors can watch an aerial view of the statue. The museum, designed by FXFOWLE Architects, will integrate with the parkland around it. It is being funded privately by <b>Diane</b> <b>von</b> Fürstenberg, Michael Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos, Coca-Cola, NBCUniversal, the family of Laurence Tisch and Preston Robert Tisch, Mellody Hobson, and George Lucas.

500|$|CSX Transportation, which {{owned the}} High Line, had given {{photographer}} Joel Sternfeld permission {{to photograph the}} line for a year. These photographs of {{the natural beauty of}} the meadow-like wildscape of the railway, discussed in an episode of the documentary series Great Museums, were used at public meetings whenever the subject of saving the High Line was discussed. Fashion designer <b>Diane</b> <b>von</b> Fürstenberg, who had moved her New York City headquarters to the Meatpacking District in 1997, organized fund-raising events for the campaign in her studio, along with her husband, Barry Diller. Broadened community support of public redevelopment of the High Line for pedestrian use grew, and in 2004, the New York City government committed $50 million to establish the proposed park. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and City Council Speakers Gifford Miller and Christine C. Quinn were important supporters. In total, funders of the High Line Park raised more than $150 million (...)

500|$|Another common {{criticism}} of Wintour's editorship focuses on Vogues {{increasing use of}} celebrities on the cover, and her insistence on making them meet her standards. She reportedly told Oprah Winfrey to lose weight before her cover photograph. Likewise, Hillary Clinton was told not to wear a blue suit. At the 2005 Anglomania celebration, a Vogue-sponsored salute to British fashion at the Met, Wintour {{is said to have}} personally chosen the clothes for prominent attendees such as Jennifer Lopez, Kate Moss, Donald Trump, and <b>Diane</b> <b>von</b> Fürstenberg. [...] "I don't think Vreeland had that kind of concentration," [...] says WWD publisher Patrick McCarthy. [...] "She wouldn't have dressed Babe Paley. Nor would Babe Paley have let her." [...] By persuading designers to loan clothes to prominent socialites and celebrities, who are then photographed wearing the clothes not only in Vogue but more general-interest magazines like People and Us, which in turn influence what buyers want, some in the industry believe Wintour is exerting too much control over it, especially since she is not involved in making or producing clothes herself. [...] "The end result is that Anna can control {{it all the way to}} the selling floor," [...] says Candy Pratts Price, executive fashion director at style.com. She has been credited with killing grunge fashion in the early 1990s, when it wasn't selling well, by telling designers if they continued to avoid glamour their looks would not be photographed for Vogue. All complied.|$|E
