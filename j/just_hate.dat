So they <b>just</b> <b>hate</b> themselves right in that moment, they can't stand , they regret everything that they did and they wish they could change things." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe noted the chorus of [...] "Me Haces Falta" [...] to be self-loathing, with the lines: [...] "Tú me haces falta/Sí, me arrepiento/Me odio/Estoy desesperada" [...] (English: [...] "I miss you/Yes, I repent/I hate myself/I'm desperate").

I <b>just</b> <b>hate</b> it when it’s used to seem 'edgy' or to sell an episode, and I hope that isn't the case here." [...] Kennedy said the Bree and Orson scenes led to [...] "a tender moment", but said Susan was annoying and the Lynette plotline was somewhat insulting toward women.

Carreau said the pairing of Robin and Katherine could be [...] "very interesting", and that {{the best part of the}} episode was the comical conversation between Robin and Karen McCluskey (Kathryn Joosten) at the end.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Love began {{composing}} {{an album}} with songwriter Linda Perry of 4 Non Blondes, titled America's Sweetheart, also reuniting with drummer Patty Schemel. Love signed with Virgin Records to release it, and began recording it in France in 2003. America's Sweetheart {{was released in}} February 2004, and received mixed reviews from critics. Charles Aaron of Spin called it a [...] "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's Live Through This" [...] and awarded it eight out of ten stars, while The Village Voice said: [...] " [...] willing to act out the dream of every teenage brat who ever {{wanted to have a}} glamorous, high-profile hissyfit, and she turns those egocentric nervous breakdowns into art. Sure, the art becomes less compelling when you've been pulling the same stunts for a decade. But, honestly, is there anybody out there who fucks up better?" [...] The album sold less than 100,000 copies. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame: [...] "America's Sweetheart was my one true piece of shit. It has no cohesive thread. I <b>just</b> <b>hate</b> it", she said in a 2014 interview. Shortly after the record was released, Love told Kurt Loder on TRL: [...] "I cannot exist as a solo artist.

500|$|In 2011, Keef first earned local {{attention}} from Chicago's South Side community with his mixtapes, The Glory Road and Bang. In December, Keef fired gunshots from a Pontiac Grand Prix in Chicago's Washington Park neighborhood. Police {{showed up at}} the scene and the incident resulted in Keef being arrested and charged with unlawful use of a weapon. Keef was consequently placed under house arrest at his grandmother's house for 30 days, followed by another 30 days of home confinement. It has been noted that by the time this incident occurred, Keef had already achieved local South Side popularity, and that much of his early fan base consisted of high school students in the area. While under house arrest, Keef posted several videos to his YouTube account. These videos were at the forefront of Chicago's hip hop subgenre, drill. The attention he received increased during the short time between the release of his mixtapes, Bang and Back From the Dead, and music videos, including [...] "Bang", [...] "3Hunna" [...] and [...] "I Don't Like". Once his house arrest ended, WorldStarHipHop released a video of a child hysterically celebrating Keef's release from house arrest, affording Keef further virality. Early in his music career, Keef's song [...] "I Don't Like" [...] became a local hit in Chicago, which was described by a local party promoter, as [...] "the perfect Chicago song because 'niggas <b>just</b> <b>hate</b> everything out here.'" [...] It also caught fellow Chicago rapper Kanye West's attention, and West created a remix of the song with rappers Pusha T, Jadakiss and Big Sean. In response to these events, David Drake of Spin writes that in 2012, Keef [...] "suddenly shot up out of obscurity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Busch {{also has}} a bitter history with Kevin Harvick. They raced each other at carnivals and go-kart tracks as {{teenagers}} and tangled many times starting in 2001. Their feud came to a boiling point in spring 2006. At Bristol in 2006, Harvick spent the drivers meeting and his pre-race interview taunting Busch following a feud at Atlanta. Busch ignored his insults and won the race, while Harvick ended up in second place. When Harvick was interviewed after the race ended {{he said that he}} was happy with his finish but said he was very upset to seeing Busch win, before calling Busch a [...] "whiner." [...] Richard Childress later apologized for his driver's comments and NASCAR gave Harvick a warning not to target Busch.

2500|$|In early 1999, HBO {{commissioned}} {{an interview}} of Wilson by the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne for {{an episode of}} Reverb which never aired.

He's been asked about his music, like, everyday of his fucking life, so you'd think that he'd {{have something to say}} about it ... I'm not in contempt of him, though.

Kenny replied: [...] "Not yet, but there's definitely the possibility in the future. I'm sure she'll be in soon". Kenny also stated that her character is to be heavily involved with her on-screen aunt Shirley. She added: [...] "The pair recognise their similarities and that brings a warmth to their relationship. At first, though, they really clash and Heather thinks that Zsa Zsa's complete trouble - which she is! Elsewhere on the Square, there's a lot of story between the other young people on the Square. Zsa Zsa definitely gets stuck in". Kenny also said about Zsa Zsa's second side: [...] "It's quite interesting because I know when Zsa Zsa comes in, people will <b>just</b> <b>hate</b> her because she's a real bitch. That's quite intimidating {{because there are so}} many good bitches on the show - Janine being the queen of them all. Zsa Zsa's a little different in the way she looks and talks, though.

2500|$|In February 2006, a major {{controversy}} erupted {{over the}} relocation of several strip clubs, {{nearly all of them}} catering to gay patrons, to Ivy City. The clubs were being forced to move from their long-time locations in the Navy Yard district (a run-down, industrial and warehouse area) due to redevelopment and the construction of Nationals Park, the new home of the Washington Nationals major league baseball team. The controversy erupted after openly gay D.C. City Council member Jim Graham announced he was sponsoring legislation to allow all eight strip clubs displaced by stadium construction to move to any location zoned for commercial or industrial use so long as it met already-established rules regarding location (e.g., not near schools or residences). Graham's bill temporarily lifted a city requirement that such moves be approved by the District of Columbia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (ABC Board). Vincent Orange, the council member representing Ward 5, immediately called a meeting of local residents to inform them about Graham's bill. The tone of the meeting, held at a local church, became angry when gay businessman Bob Siegel announced he was considering purchase of a warehouse for use by a gay strip club at 1216 Mount Olivet Road NE. Residents decried the effect that nudity would have on the morals of local youth, and the gay clubs were accused of bringing bestiality into the neighborhood. One resident, noting that gay strip clubs often distributed condoms and personal lubricant free to customers, denounced the clubs as [...] "pleasure pit". Kathryn Pearson-West, a Ward 5 community activist, accused Graham of [...] "picking on" [...] a new council member (Thomas was in his year as Ward 5 council member) and low-income people. Some Ivy City residents argued that racism was at issue, that the city would never have considered putting a cluster of gay strip clubs in a white neighborhood. The club owners said that homosexuality was the real reason for the opposition. Philip Pannell, formerly the liaison to the LGBT community for Mayor Williams, later went much further, angrily denouncing opposition to the clubs as [...] "sheer homophobia", saying that many Ivy City residents [...] "don't fear gay people, they <b>just</b> <b>hate</b> them." [...] Siegel did not purchase the property on Mt. Olivet Road, but did purchase 2120 West Virginia Ave NE and 2046 West Virginia NE. Two other properties were also purchased by gay strip club owners. In May 2007, 50 residents of Ivy City personally lobbied D.C. City Council members against Graham's bill. Over the next month, Ivy City residents held neighborhood rallies and distributed fliers to local residents to drum up opposition to the clubs.|$|E
