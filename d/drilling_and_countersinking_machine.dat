40|$|Flexible {{automation}} for <b>drilling</b> <b>and</b> <b>countersinking</b> {{has been}} successfully implemented in the assembly of {{a small number of}} aircraft structures. These systems have demonstrated the capability {{to reduce the risk of}} repetitive use injuries, improve quality, and reduce labor costs. Despite these successes, disruptive delays to production resulted when similar technology was initially implemented in the assembly of 777 wing structures. Baseline data was collected to analyze the performance of the system, and it was found that the delays were largely a result of machine breakdowns or error conditions during production. Three changes to the equipment and processes were prioritized because they could be quickly implemented and were expected to address some of the most-common causes of the in-process machine errors. Average drilling times were reduced by 5. 9 %, <b>and</b> maximum <b>drilling</b> times were reduced by 10 % as a result of these changes. Process simulations based on the data demonstrated that the expected frequency of production delays was reduced from 37. 4 % to 17. 6 % of all wings produced. by Zackary R. Eubanks. Thesis: M. B.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation is}} conducted into the damage progression {{and strength of}} bolted joints between fibre-reinforced composite laminates using countersunk fasteners. Experimental tests were previously conducted on a bearing test specimen <b>and</b> <b>countersunk</b> fastener single-lap joints. In this work, computational models are developed for Abaqus/Explicit, with continuum shells employed to model in-plane ply failure. The bolt-nut assembly is modelled with rigid elements, and the models account for bolt torque and frictional contact. The material properties required in the computational model are determined from standard tests, with the compression fracture toughness of composite plies calibrated against experimental data from the bearing test. The analysis approach captures the load-carrying capability of all configurations, and provides reasonable accuracy in predicting damage patterns. The effects of bolt torque, clearance <b>and</b> <b>countersink</b> height ratio are investigated, and the analysis results compare well with experimental findings. Furthermore, the analysis provides rich insight into the damage progression and joint behaviour at the ply level, with the in-plane and through-thickness damage patterns mapped for increasing applied load. Delamination is incorporated using a cohesive element layer {{at the start of}} the countersunk region, though has minimal influence on damage progression and load-carrying capability, which agrees with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} conducted into the damage progression {{and strength of}} bolted joints with fibre-reinforced composite laminates <b>and</b> <b>countersunk</b> fasteners. The main goal of the experimental investigation is to characterise {{the effect of the}} countersink geometry on the load-carrying capacity of single lap joints in comparison to the straight-shank case. The effects of bolt torque, clearance <b>and</b> <b>countersink</b> height ratio on the damage progression and joint strength are also studied. Experimental tests and detailed microscopy studies are conducted on a bearing test specimen with a straight-edged hole, and several single-lap joint configurations with countersunk fasteners. It is found that introduction of the countersunk hole roughly halves the bearing stress, and causes delamination for some configurations. This delamination is primarily located {{at the start of the}} countersink region, though is found to be triggered by other damage mechanisms and has only minor influence on the results. Bolt torque increases the density of through-thickness damage though limits its extension from the hole edge, whilst bolt clearance causes localisation of the damage region. Increasing the ratio of the countersink depth to the laminate thickness reduces the extent of bearing and promotes bending, with a change to net section failure at large ratios...|$|R

Protruding <b>and</b> <b>countersunk</b> joints have been considered, with different bolt diameters and different interfaces (composite-to-composite and composite-to-aluminum). First, static tensile tests have been performed on single-lap joints. Then, non-destructive ultrasonic evaluations have been conducted at intermediate load levels and at final failure in order to show the real onset and evolution of damage inside the joints in terms of fibers and matrix breakage...|$|R
