500|$|During the campaign, {{columnist}} Cal Thomas on Fox News labeled Michelle Obama as an [...] "Angry Black Woman" [...] {{and some}} web sites attempted to propagate this image, prompting her to respond: [...] "Barack and I {{have been in}} the public eye for many years now, and we've developed a thick skin along the way. When you're out campaigning, there will always be criticism. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> it in stride, {{and at the end of}} the day, I know that it comes with the territory." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 2009 book [...] "Parkour", David Belle {{stressed}} {{that the most important}} aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. [...] "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E

"Do it?--nothing simpler! <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> my Seven-league Boots, {{run over}} to Rome, pick up Prince Charles, {{put him on the}} magic carpet, fly to London, clap the Cap of Darkness on him so that nobody can see him, set him down on the throne of his fathers; pick up the Elector, carry him over to his beloved Hanover, and the trick is done--what they call a bloodless {{revolution}} in the history books." ...|$|E
5000|$|Fonville himself {{recalled}} {{of these}} images, [...] "I didn’t {{take any of}} these pictures deliberately. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> them for fun. None was on assignment.

6000|$|... "Ay, she's {{been here}} to show herself," [...] Vont muttered, [...] "down in a motor-car, in furs and silks, like a {{creature}} from some world that I know not about. She's talked as you've talked. I've listened to the pair of you. I thrust my daughter out of the garden and bade her go away and learn the truth. And you--well, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> leave to say that as I cursed you nigh on a score of years ago, and have cursed you in my heart ever since, so I curse you now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{told him}} as she relit her lamp, and stood eyeing him sharply the while. When she {{finished}} he was silent a minute, then said, looking half vexed and half ashamed, [...] "I see how it is, and I'm glad you alone have found me out. I walk in my sleep sometimes, Hester, that's the truth. I thought I'd got over it, but it's come back, you see, and I'm sorry for it. Don't be troubled. I never do any mischief or come to any harm. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> a quiet promenade and march back to bed again. Did I frighten you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Doctor," [...] {{said the}} grave-digger, looking quietly into the {{cavernous}} pit {{which he had}} hollowed, [...] "it is against common sense that a dead man should think to keep a grave to himself longer than till you can take up his substance in a shovel. It would be a strange thing enough, if, when living families are turned {{out of their homes}} twice or thrice in a generation, (as {{they are likely to be}} in our new government,) a dead man should think he must sleep in one spot till the day of judgment. No; turn about, I say, to these old fellows. As long as they can decently be called dead men, I let them lie; when they are nothing but dust, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> leave to stir them on occasion. This is the way we do things under the republic, whatever your customs be in the old country." ...|$|E

5000|$|Miller {{was also}} quite {{stressed}} on the court. For example, she said: “A {{lot of the}} girls are friends {{with each other and}} have friends but the way I feel, and maybe <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> everything too personally, is that there is somehow not enough total separation.” ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I was {{screaming}} up and down. I was actually {{at home and}} listening to New York Radio Online. I had called all my friends, telling them to listen. My mom video taped me.

5000|$|On October 26, Fox said, [...] "The {{irony of}} it is that I was too medicated." [...] He added to Katie Couric that his jumpy condition, as he spoke to her, {{reflected}} [...] "a dearth of medication — not by design. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> it, and it kicks in when it kicks in." [...] He further laughed, [...] "That's funny — the notion that you could calculate it for effect." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "A gentleman {{standing}} beside me stopped the SS man very politely: Excuse me sir, I {{will leave the}} luggage - can <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> out a picture? The SS man lost his temper and let the dogs loose. They didn’t run, they just flew in the air straight to the men’s neck.And as the man stopped moving, I said: My God this man is dead! And {{this was the first}} 10 -15 minutes. I knew I am in Hell.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{accusations of}} Mencia's {{plagiarism}} were referenced in [...] "Fishsticks," [...] the April 8, 2009 {{episode of the}} animated TV series South Park, in which Mencia takes credit for a joke that Jimmy Valmer writes in the episode. When {{faced with the prospect}} of being assaulted, he admits, [...] "I took credit for it because I'm not actually funny!... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> jokes and repackage them with a Mexican accent!" [...] The character is then killed by Kanye West.|$|E

5000|$|Literally all of {{the main}} characters, except one, are reincarnations of the same soul in {{different}} bodies throughout the novel identified by a birthmark...that's just a symbol really of the universality of human nature. The title itself [...] "Cloud Atlas," [...] the cloud refers to the ever changing manifestations of the Atlas, which is the fixed human nature which is always thus and ever shall be. So the book's theme is predacity, the way individuals prey on individuals, groups on groups, nations on nations, tribes on tribes. So <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> this theme {{and in a sense}} reincarnate that theme in another context...|$|E
5000|$|I already {{created the}} {{beginning}} of the album. [...] "Le chant des sirènes" [...] helped me to get to the end because it talks about reality mixed with fiction.

[...] Now, I don't hesitate to read a book, to watch a film without feeling like stealing something from someone. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> impression. I don't hesitate to call a friend, to ask him what he's doing. And in my head, I do a sort of interview to look for inspiration. Before, I had a sort of ego. I had to invent everything.

5000|$|On 4 December 2008, Samuel gave an {{interview}} with CNN in which she said she sees no heroism in her actions and that she wishes {{she could have been}} able to help more people, especially Moshe's parents. She also stated that she still has nightmares about the attacks. Currently, Samuel is living in Israel where she remains the caregiver for Moshe, who she says is learning to play again although he likes to have her close by. Samuel told {{an interview}}er, [...] "They said it is important I am here Israel. Me, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> care of the baby." [...] When asked about her plans for the future, Samuel said she would stay in Israel for as long as Moshe needs her. She stated that [...] "No one knows how much Moshe saw, or how much he knows. His back is bruised where terrorists hit him. Now I want to see that this baby who has been given in my care, he grows big, brave like his dad." [...] Samuel says she wants to be with Moshe until he [...] "grows big" [...] and that [...] "By God's grace I hope I am there to see it. That's it. All my blessings to my Moshe baby." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jamie Anne Allman (Terry Marek) {{spoke about}} the {{seasonal}} transition and her view on doing guest appearances and being a regular character: [...] "This season, they've written me some very interesting, unique things that I didn't get to dabble with last year. So, every scene is different and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> each scene individually. Then when I watch it as a whole I'm like, 'Oh, it was one piece.' I take each scene, look at it, break it down and it's a new experience every time, with every scene. But being with the characters the whole time, {{for a long period}} of time really allows you to sink your teeth into something more than if you're just doing a guest star. If you're doing a guest star spot, you come in at the heightened part of your character who's having a breakdown or is having a real moment, and in a show where you're the same character the whole time it's a progression. You have to let it build." [...] She was shocked to learn that her character was Rosie Larsen's killer: [...] "Veena Sud had called me a couple hours before I was going in to read for the table read for episode 13, the last episode, that I was the killer. When she gave me the news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Kris Nissen Volkswagen {{motorsport}} chief told me at Hockenheim that if I {{wanted to}} go to Macau I would have to win the race there. I won that race - and now he said, if I don't want to come back next year, I have to win on Sunday! So, I have to win tomorrow. For sure, I was not expecting to do a new lap record and a qualifying like that. You need a bit of experience to be fast on this track, but the car was just fantastic. It has a good engine and a good car for the city. I like this track. I push a lot but I also don't take a lot of risks. I really like the city tracks - like Pau and Monaco for example, and I knew that this track would be for me. My Signature team has had good results here, with Edoardo Mortara last year and Nicolas Lapierre in the past. We have a good car, a good engine - in fact a perfect engine for the straights. I was catching Marcus Ericsson, not easily, but I was catching him. I had a good feeling with the car straight away too. I can attack with it - and take no risks. A lot of drivers in qualifying were in the wall because they were at 200 per cent, and me I was just improving my driving lap after lap to take not so many risks. And finally I won. But I don't care if it is the main race or the qualifying race. I was fast today and for sure the aim is to win tomorrow, but we will see what happens. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>take</b> pleasure from it, and we will see." [...] Jean-Karl Vernay, after surprising himself by taking victory and a new outright lap record. After hitting the wall on countless occasions over the previous two days, Chen was withdrawn from the race due to a cracked monocoque. Thus, this left the grid at 29 for the 10-lap race, and Vernay got the jump on Ericsson away from the start-finish line, and took the lead into the first corner, {{but by the time the}} drivers had reached Lisboa, Ericsson was back in front just as the safety car came out. Further back, Bianchi rode over the rear wheel of Mortara at San Francisco, causing enough damage for the Frenchman to pit. Rosenzweig collided with the barriers at the Mandarin, which brought the safety car out for three laps. Arundel's Carlin car encountered mechanical troubles under the safety car, after some debris punctured a hole in the radiator of his Volkswagen engine. This left the order as Ericsson, Vernay, Mortara (who moved up despite his collision), Bottas, Ricciardo, Vanthoor, Bird, Coletti, Mäki and Hartley. Boyd moved up five positions at the start, as he was the biggest winner off the line.|$|E
