5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The Great War (World War I) had left her feeling shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of <b>her</b> <b>child</b> with Aldington: she believed it was her shock at hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused <b>her</b> <b>child</b> to be stillborn. Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E

5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles {{and expectations of}} being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for <b>her</b> <b>child</b> due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to <b>her</b> <b>child.</b> The attempt to activate the emotions of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements. Family affects us significantly on this psychological level – {{the level at which}} advertisements are most effective.|$|E
