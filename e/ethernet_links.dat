50|$|ISL is Cisco's VLAN Encapsulation {{protocol}} and is supported only on some Cisco equipment over the Fast and Gigabit <b>Ethernet</b> <b>links.</b> It is offered {{as an alternative}} to the IEEE 802.1Q standard, a widely used VLAN tagging protocol, although the use of ISL for new sites is deprecated by Cisco. In the case of ISL the tag is external to the Ethernet frame, which effectively is the same as encapsulating the Ethernet frame, whereas with IEEE 802.1Q the tag is internal. This is a key advantage for IEEE 802.1Q as it means tagged frames can be sent over standard <b>Ethernet</b> <b>links.</b>|$|E

50|$|Because ISATAP uses IPv4 as a non multicast/broadcast-capable (unlike <b>Ethernet)</b> <b>link</b> layer, ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery {{cannot be}} done in the usual manner. That is why ISATAP is a bit more complex than 6over4.|$|R
50|$|The 10/10G-EPON {{employs a}} number of {{functions}} that are common to other point-to-point Ethernet standards. For example, such functions as 64B/66B line coding, self-synchronizing scrambler, or gearbox are also used in optical fiber types of 10 Gigabit <b>Ethernet</b> <b>links.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Internet is {{increasingly}} being {{called upon to}} provide di erent levels of service to di erent applications and users. A practical problem in doing so is that although Ethernet {{is one of the}} hops for nearly all communication in the Internet, it does not provide any QoS guarantees. A natural question, therefore, is the effect of o ered load on Ethernet throughput and delay. In this paper, we present several techniques for accurately and efficiently modeling the behavior of a heavily loaded <b>Ethernet</b> <b>link.</b> We propose an efficient distributed simulation model, called Fast Ethernet Simulation, that empirically models an <b>Ethernet</b> <b>link</b> to quickly and accurately simulate it. By eliminating the implementation of CSMA/CD protocol, our approach reduces computational complexity drastically while still maintaining desirable accuracy. Performance results show that our techniques not only add very little overhead (less than 5 % in our tests) to the basic cost of simulating an <b>Ethernet</b> <b>link,</b> but also closely match real-world measurements. We also present efficient techniques for compressing cumulative distributions using hyperbolic curves and for monitoring the load on a heavily loaded link. Finally, we show applications to illustrate the potential usage of the Fast Ethernet Simulation...|$|R
5000|$|The {{time that}} is {{consumed}} by a guard band is lost - it cannot be used to transmit any data, as the Ethernet port needs to be silent. Therefore, the lost time directly translates in lost bandwidth for background traffic on that particular <b>Ethernet</b> <b>link.</b>|$|R
