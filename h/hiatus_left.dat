50|$|The Indian Actors Association {{was formed}} around 1936 {{and was a}} {{non-profit}} Hollywood based organization. They formed after and were influenced by the War Paint Club, an organization meant to protect rights of Native American actors. Additionally, driven by the Hollywood practice of casting non-native actors as Indians in films, the Native actors working in Los Angeles at the time seized their opportunity to establish a pool of “authentic” Indian actors to work in film. Their goal was also to keep Indian portrayals and culture from being misrepresented or warped. The Indian Actors Association fought for equality and employment for Indian actors {{at a time when}} they were not seen as important or equal. The country’s economic depression and the Western movie <b>hiatus</b> <b>left</b> many Indian actors unemployed, which caused depression and poverty on the reservations resulting in many Indians looking for employment elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|The {{information}} {{obtained from a}} 21 m thick open-pit section of silty-clayey sediments in the Arumetsa bedrock valley, southwestern Estonia, revealed that lacustrine to glaciolacustrine sedimentation at the site started prior to 151 ka ago and lasted to {{about the end of}} marine isotope stage 6 (MIS 6) at 130 ka. Further down from the 151 ka age-level {{to the bottom of the}} buried valley there are ca 60 m of lacustrine fine-grained sediments, the age of which remains still unclear. The Late Saalian sediments at Arumetsa are discordantly overlain by Middle Weichselian clay, silt and sand, deposited between ca 44 and 37 ka ago. As testified by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages, and pollen and diatom record, the Middle Weichselian fine-grained sediments contain redeposited Holsteinian but no Eemian pollen, and have not been fully bleached during deposition. Chronological, microfossil and sedimentological data show two hiatuses in the Arumetsa section. The first <b>hiatus</b> has <b>left</b> no sedimentary evidence for the period between ca 130 ka and 44 ka ago (MIS 5 to older half of MIS 3). The younger hiatus from ca 37 to 22 ka occurs between the Middle Weichselian lacustrine silt and the Late Weichselian till layer on top of the section...|$|R

He had alcoholic liver cirrhosis and received radical laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy for gastric cancer 3 years ago. Early gastric cancer in the remnant stomach was found by routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. We initially performed endoscopic submucosal dissection, but the vertical margin was positive in a pathological result. We performed total gastrectomy with antecolic Roux-Y reconstruction by laparotomy. For adhesion of the esophageal <b>hiatus,</b> the <b>left</b> chest was connected with the abdominal cavity. A pleural defect was not repaired. Two days after the operation, the patient was suspected of having intrathoracic hernia by chest X-rays. Computed tomography showed that the transverse colon and Roux limb were incarcerated in the left thoracic cavity. He was diagnosed with intrathoracic hernia, and emergency reduction and repair were performed. Operative findings showed that the Roux limb and transverse colon were incarcerated in the thoracic cavity. After reduction, the orifice of the hernia was closed by suturing the crus of the diaphragm with the ligament of the jejunum and omentum. After the second operation, he experienced anastomotic leakage and left pyothorax.
