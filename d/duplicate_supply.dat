5000|$|... 2 Maythe {{ambulances}} in Es Salt {{were becoming}} short of dressings, anti-tetanic serum, chloroform, sutures and medical comforts. A stock {{of these was}} sent out on a donkey ammunition convoy and by very fine handling it made the ascent of the Umm esh Shert pass {{in the dark and}} arrived at Es Salt next morning. A <b>duplicate</b> <b>supply</b> was sent by aeroplane ... these supplies could only be dropped from the aeroplane and as Es Salt was in a basin, the drop would be about 1,000 feet. No experiment had previously been made in Palestine to determine in what manner they could be packed so as to avoid breakage when dropped. It was thought that they would be best wrapped in motor tubes but none could he obtained quickly enough. Accordingly the method adopted was that which had been employed in the siege of Kut-el-Amara. The materials were placed in a loosely filled sandbag, bottles being well packed in cotton wool in addition; this was enclosed in a second sandbag. Forty pounds of dressings were prepared at Jerusalem whence the aeroplane started. All were received intact at Es Salt with the exception of phials and bottles, the whole of which were broken.

40|$|In {{pulmonary}} atresia with ventricular septal defect and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries, {{there is a}} tendency for each collateral artery to be the sole supply to a particular region of lung. On injection into a collateral artery, however, "wash-out" of contrast medium by non-opacified blood from a second source is sometimes seen. Alternatively, contrast medium may faintly "wash-in" to an adjacent lobar artery supplied from a second source. "Wash-in" and "wash-out" therefore show that a duplicate blood supply exists. To assess the importance of these phenomena, we reviewed the angiograms of 50 patients with this condition. Duplicate pulmonary blood supply not resulting from surgical shunts was found in 25 patients (50 %), and in 24 of 37 patients (65 %) who had selective collateral injections. In one patient two collaterals anastomosed with each other. Thirty-nine instances of <b>duplicate</b> <b>supply</b> occurred in the remaining 24. The duplicate connection was to a region of lung connected to a central pulmonary artery in 29 of 39 instances (74 %). Determination of how much of the peripheral pulmonary vasculature is connected to central pulmonary arteries greatly affects decisions about palliative and corrective surgery. These results show that unless "wash-in" and "wash-out" are specifically looked for, the information obtained from angiography may be erroneous...|$|E
50|$|To {{cope with}} the demand, CFM is <b>duplicating</b> <b>supply</b> sources on 80% of parts and even {{subdivide}} assembly sites, already shared between GE and Safran: GE assembles its production in Lafayette, Indiana {{in addition to its}} previous Durham, North Carolina facility. As more than 75% of the engine comes from suppliers, critical parts suppliers pass “run-rate stress tests” lasting two to 12 weeks. Pratt & Whitney acknowledges a production ramp-up bottleneck on its rival PW1100G geared turbofan including a critical shortage of the unique aluminium-titanium fan blade, hitting the Airbus A320neo and the Bombardier CSeries deliveries.|$|R
50|$|After {{years of}} success of Toyota’s Lean Production, the {{consolidation}} of supply chain networks has brought Toyota {{to the position of}} being the world's biggest carmaker in the rapid expansion. In 2010, the crisis of safety-related problems in Toyota made other carmakers that <b>duplicated</b> Toyota’s <b>supply</b> chain system wary that the same recall issue might happen to them.|$|R
50|$|Decades later, {{after living}} out Ashbless's entire life and {{becoming}} a widower, Doyle goes out to meet his historic date with death. Doyle discovers that his intended murderer is a duplicate of himself that the Master had made in Egypt decades before. Doyle kills the <b>duplicate,</b> thereby <b>supplying</b> the corpse for his death, and boats away into an unknown future.|$|R
50|$|Dalbiac {{resigned}} {{his commission}} in 1912, {{but with the}} outbreak of the First World War in 1914 returned to the army, and was given the task of forming a second line <b>duplicate</b> of the <b>supply</b> column for the newly raised 60th Division. He travelled with the new unit to Salonika, and was mentioned in despatches. A partner in the publishing company of Swan Sommenschein & Co., he became a director of George Allen & Unwin Limited in 1914.|$|R
60|$|As {{the main}} object {{of all my}} {{journeys}} was to obtain specimens of natural history, both for my private collection and to <b>supply</b> <b>duplicates</b> to museums and amateurs, I will give a general statement {{of the number of}} specimens I collected, and which reached home in good condition. I must premise that I generally employed one or two, and sometimes three Malay servants to assist me; and for nearly half the time had the services of an English lad, Charles Allen. I was just eight years away from England, but as I travelled about fourteen thousand miles within the Archipelago, and made sixty or seventy separate journeys, each involving some preparation and loss of time, I do not think that more than six years were really occupied in collecting.|$|R
40|$|What {{this thesis}} {{attempts}} to present is a systematic and ordered assembling of different true chemical toners on {{two types of}} black and white enlarging papers with two different developers. It is my hope that this study will be of some use as a reference in what effect it is possible to achieve with different combinations of toners, papers, and developers. Although not all possible combinations have been tried, most color choices are represented and I decided to display the same image repeatedly. A conventional paper developer, Kodak Dektol, as well as a developer of somewhat higher quality with a Glycin base, GAF 130, were used. Each respective thesis has its own enlarged and toned black and white photographic prints. An attempt has been made to try to report results clearly and factually, and to try to keep this paper as visual as possible. All toners are found with their respective formulas and all information necessary to <b>duplicate</b> results is <b>supplied.</b> I felt it was necessary to display the real effect of toners upon modern photographic materials because of their inherent capability to alter a convectional black and white photographic print. This alteration will ultimately affect the response of the viewer through the emotional impact of color. by Micaela Garzoni Rantoul. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)

50|$|The year before, {{he married}} Amelia Day from Bristol. A severe lung condition, {{possibly}} asthma, {{caused him to}} move to South Africa and take up the post of principal at the newly established Shaw College in Grahamstown. His health rapidly improved and leaving chemistry behind he resumed studying botany {{in which he had}} become interested while still in England, having started a collection of flowers and mosses. This interest was furthered by his association with Dr William Guybon Atherstone, Henry Hutton and Mrs. FW Barber. He entered into a fruitful exchange of specimens and correspondence with Asa Gray of the States, Sir William Hooker of Kew and with Harvey and Sonder who were working on the Flora Capensis. Finding it a drain on his own time to <b>supply</b> <b>duplicates</b> to overseas collectors, he formed the South African Botanical Exchange Society, which brought together a large number of amateur botanists. By 1868 roughly 9000 duplicates had been sent abroad, for which in return they received specimens from Europe, North America and Australia. His contributions are acknowledged in the introductions to Flora Capensis. He assisted Atherstone and HG Galpin in confirming in 1867 that the Hopetown or Eureka Diamond was indeed a diamond. Eventually he became head of natural sciences at Gill College, Somerset East, South Africa and then later director of the Cape Town Botanical Garden and curator of the Cape Government Herbarium. Peter MacOwan's daughter Flora married Selmar Schonland in 1896.|$|R
