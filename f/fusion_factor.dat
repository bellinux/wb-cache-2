40|$|Abstract Bone-resorbing osteoclasts {{are formed}} through fusion of mononucleated precursors. Their choice of part-ners during the fusion process remains unclear. We {{hypothesized}} that osteoclasts are {{selective in their}} choice of fusion partner and that this selectivity is based on hetero-geneity among the cells {{with respect to their}} maturation stage and their expression and cellular organization of <b>fusion</b> <b>factors.</b> Support for this hypothesis was found from immunofluorescence staining of the osteoclast fusion fac-tors CD 47, dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP), and syncytin- 1. These stainings revealed heterogeneous localization patterns of all three factors within a given culture of osteoclasts. CD 47 was found to be localized primarily in small osteoclasts and preosteoclasts, which were also positive for DC-STAMP but negative for cathepsin K expression. A role of CD 47 in the early osteo-clast fusion steps was also suggested from experiments with a CD 47 blocking antibody, which resulted in an inhibition of the fusion of small osteoclasts. Conversely, blocking of connexin 43 affected the fusion of larger osteoclasts with four or more nuclei. The suggestion that different <b>fusion</b> <b>factors</b> function at different stages of osteoclast fusion supports the idea of heterogeneity in the osteoclast popu-lation; our results suggest that osteoclast fusion is indeed based on heterogeneity. Considering the in vivo environ-ment in which osteoclasts develop and fuse, our findings seem very applicable and provide novel, important insight into key issues in bone and fusion research...|$|R

Efficient SNARE-dependent fusion has been shown in many settings in vivo to require the generation of both phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) and phosphatidic acid (PA). Addition of PA to Stx 4 /SNAP 23 vesicles markedly enhanced the fusion rate, whereas its addition to VAMP 2 vesicles was inhibitory. In contrast, addition of PIP 2 to Stx 4 /SNAP 23 vesicles inhibited the fusion reaction, and its addition to VAMP 2 vesicles was stimulatory. The optimal distribution of phospholipids was found to trigger the progression from the hemifused state to full fusion.

40|$|The {{timing of}} some of the {{molecular}} events that are required for cell fusion was investigated. Cell fusion was produced by a mutant of herpes simplex virus type 1 that causes extensive cell fusion during infection. The timing of molecular events required for fusion was established by the use of blocking agents. Phosphonoacetic acid blocks viral DNA synthesis; actinomycin D blocks RNA synthesis; cycloheximide blocks protein synthesis; 2 -deoxyglucose blocks glycosylation of glycoproteins; high temperature, NH 4 Cl, and adamantanone block unknown steps required for cell fusion. For cells infected at a low multiplicity of infection, phosphonoacetic acid decreased the rate but not the final amount of fusion, but at a multiplicity of infection of 10 it had no effect on the rate of cell fusion. RNA synthesis was required for fusion until 4 h after infection, protein synthesis until 5. 5 h after infection, and glycosylation until 7 h after infection. The temperature-dependent step occurred before 6 h after infection, whereas NH 4 Cl and adamantanone acted at steps that occurred until 8 h after infection. Cycloheximide, temperature, NH 4 Cl, and adamantanone acted reversibly; actinomycin D and 2 -deoxyglucose acted irreversibly. The same order of action of the inhibitors was also determined by using pairs of inhibitors sequentially. These experiments also indicated that the <b>fusion</b> <b>factor</b> was not an α-polypeptide. Virus growth and cell fusion were both found to be highly dependent on temperature in the range of 30 to 40 °C.
