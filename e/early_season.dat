5|$|Crop {{rotation}} is, {{however, the}} most important cultural control of L. decemlineata. Rotation may delay the infestation of potatoes and can reduce the build-up of <b>early</b> <b>season</b> beetle populations because the adults emerging from diapause can only disperse to new food sources by walking. One 1984 study showed that rotating potatoes with non-host plants reduced the density of <b>early</b> <b>season</b> adults by 95.8%.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{rotation}} {{can help}} to control pests by depriving them of their host plants. It is a major tactic in the control of corn rootworm, and has reduced <b>early</b> <b>season</b> incidence of Colorado potato beetle {{by as much as}} 95%.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, the <b>early</b> <b>season</b> follows an arc where Landry kills {{and hides}} {{the body of}} a man who {{attempted}} to rape Tyra, leading to a romance between the two. Eventually, guilt builds within Landry and he confesses. Charges are not pressed, although tension between him and Tyra remains. Landry also joins the football team.|$|E
5|$|Demaret {{took the}} team's second single-day win at the Tartu GP in late May. He {{was the best}} of a five-rider {{breakaway}} {{at the front of the}} race, one which included teammate Taaramäe. That same day, Gallopin took sixth in a sprint finish to the Grand Prix de Plumelec-Morbihan. The team's last race of the <b>early</b> <b>season</b> was Halle–Ingooigem in June, where Sijmens rode to ninth place.|$|E
5|$|Having {{built up}} a {{reputation}} as one of the best amateur cricketers in England, Yardley played three <b>early</b> <b>season</b> matches for the MCC, but he was selected for neither the Gentlemen nor for England that year. He played his first full season for Yorkshire, scoring centuries against Cambridge, Warwickshire and Sussex; in total, he scored 1,086 runs at an average of 27.84 and took 17 wickets.|$|E

5|$|Macartney resumed Test cricket when Australia hosted England in 1920–21, {{and was one}} of {{only four}} players {{remaining}} from before the war. However, he only played in two of the Tests due to illness and injury. His <b>early</b> <b>season</b> form was ominous for the tourists. Macartney scored 161 in guiding New South Wales to a successful run-chase of 4/335 over the Englishmen. He then scored 96 and 30 for an Australian XI against the tourists in a dress rehearsal for the Tests.|$|E
5|$|Rindt was commemorated in many ways. The <b>early</b> <b>season</b> BARC 200 Formula Two {{race was}} renamed the Jochen Rindt Memorial Trophy {{for as long}} as the series existed. In 2000, on the 30th anniversary of his death, the city of Graz {{unveiled}} a bronze plaque in remembrance of Rindt, with wife Nina and daughter Natasha present. The penultimate corner at the Red Bull Ring in Austria is named after Rindt.|$|E
5|$|Voeckler {{was one of}} {{the more}} {{prolific}} winners of the <b>early</b> <b>season,</b> tallying eight victories in 2011, the last of them obtained on May 8.

5|$|A similar outcome {{followed}} in the 200m World finals. In the semi-final, Gatlin outpaced Bolt – the Jamaican at 19.95 and the American at 19.87. Despite such slow times prior to Beijing, Bolt delivered in the final with his fifth fastest run ever for the 200m at 19.55 seconds. Gatlin failed to reach his <b>early</b> <b>season</b> form and finished almost two-tenths of a second behind Bolt. Bolt's four consecutive wins over 200m at the World Championships was unprecedented and established him clearly as the best ever sprinter at the competition.|$|E
5|$|Cancellara's {{first victory}} of the 2009 season came in the prologue of the Tour of California. This was his second victory {{in a row in}} the prologue at the Tour of California. Cancellara then {{returned}} to the Tirreno–Adriatico, but an injury prevented his efforts to repeat as winner of the event. Cancellara did not finish the sixth stage of the race; he left the event without winning a single stage. Poor performance marred the early portion of the season for Cancellara as he achieved no success in the <b>early</b> <b>season</b> classics; he did not finish the Tour of Flanders after suffering problem with his bike chain early in the race, on the Koppenberg, and he finished 49th overall in the Paris–Roubaix.|$|E
5|$|On August 2, {{after an}} {{extraordinarily}} active <b>early</b> <b>season,</b> the NOAA released an updated outlook on {{the remainder of}} the season, significantly raising the expected level of activity to numbers about double those of a normal season. The ACE value was now forecast to be 180 to 270% of the median. The NOAA also noted a higher than normal confidence in the forecast of above-normal activity. On August 5, 2005, Gray and his associates followed suit and issued their updated forecast; it was consistent with NOAA's update. Although neither the NOAA nor Gray had ever forecast such high levels of activity, even the midseason outlooks fell far short of the actual level of activity. The actual ACE would prove to be 248 × 104 kt2— 277% of the median.|$|E

5|$|Seeking {{to double}} his $7,000 salary from the {{previous}} season, Henderson became embroiled in a contract dispute with the Red Wings prior to the 1966–67 NHL season, before the team acceded to his demands. He then spent the year attempting to overcome injuries; a case of tracheitis forced him to miss several <b>early</b> <b>season</b> games and led the team to consider having him play wearing a surgical mask {{to protect against the}} cold air of the arena. Henderson eventually spent time in the dry air of Arizona to cure the ailment, but he also suffered from torn chest muscles and ultimately missed a third of the season. On the ice, Henderson scored 21 goals and 40 points in 49 games.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine {{joined the}} Spurs for the 2002–03 NBA season, {{where he played}} backup for veteran guard Steve Smith. He {{spent much of the}} <b>early</b> <b>season</b> injured, and found it hard to adjust to the NBA's style of play. As his injury improved, so did Ginóbili, winning the Western Conference Rookie of the Month in March, and being named to the All-Rookie Second Team {{at the end of the}} season. Still, he only started in five games as the Spurs chalked up a 60–22 regular season win–loss record. The Spurs then entered the playoffs eager to upend the {{defending}} champions Los Angeles Lakers, at which point Ginóbili rose to prominence.|$|E
5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, <b>early</b> <b>season</b> sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E

5|$|A {{surge in}} {{offensive}} production from Giordano and fellow defencemen T. J. Brodie and Dennis Wideman {{resulted in the}} Flames {{being one of the}} NHL's biggest surprises early in the 2014–15 season. Predicted to finish {{near the bottom of the}} standings before the season, the Flames instead began December with one of the best records in the league, in large part due to the play of Giordano, who led all NHL defencemen with 25 points, four better than Brodie. His plus-minus of +14 ranked him second in the league. The NHL recognized Giordano's <b>early</b> <b>season</b> play by naming him its First Star of the month of November. He was subsequently named as the Flames' representative at the 60th National Hockey League All-Star Game. Giordano played his 500th career game on February 2, 2015, in a victory over the Winnipeg Jets. He set a personal best by scoring his 48th point of the season in a 3–1 win over the New Jersey Devils on February 25, but also suffered an injury in the game. The Flames announced one week later that he required surgery for a completely torn biceps tendon; the estimated recovery time of four to five months meant that his season was over.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1926 season, Chapman was no longer the star of English cricket. Although still respected for his earlier achievements, he had a modest record in Test and first-class cricket. During the season, the Australians toured England for another Ashes series. Chapman did not play any <b>early</b> <b>season</b> games and his first match for Kent was against the touring side. He scored 51, his first first-class fifty since January 1925. A week later, he scored 159 in the County Championship, bringing him back into contention for an England place, then scored 89 in a Test trial match played against the Australians. Chapman's appearances for Kent were sporadic {{for the rest of the}} season, but he scored 629 runs in his nine County Championship games at an average of 57.18 to lead the Kent averages. He also scored a century for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's.|$|E
5|$|Chappuis {{was drafted}} by the Pittsburgh Steelers, and reports in February 1948 {{indicated}} that the Steelers had offered him a two-year contract for $20,000 per year. However, Chappuis passed up the Steelers' offer, opting instead {{to play for the}} new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). In June 1948, Chappuis signed with Branch Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers of the AAFC after coach Carl Voyles outbid the Steelers for his services at $17,000. Chappuis had been drafted by the Cleveland Browns, and the Dodgers gave the Browns three draft picks in exchange for the right to sign Chappuis. Rickey had felt that modern football was based on speed and that he could win with a good center, passing quarterback and two tall sprinting ends. Thus, he placed a premium on signing Chappuis, the passing quarterback. The college All-star game caused Chappuis to miss three weeks of practice and he played little in the <b>early</b> <b>season</b> games because he had not learned his plays.|$|E
