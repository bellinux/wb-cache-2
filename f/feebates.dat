Standards have effectively improved the efficiency and performance {{in a wide variety}} of products, including passenger vehicles; but <b>feebates</b> promote even better performance (as opposed to just beating standards), and are less “gameable” or dependent on politics. Some might argue that a government could create marketing programs and incentives for rideshare, but as governments are so reliant on sales taxes from automobiles, there is no money for the government in carpool or rideshare. In a time when governments have increasing debt and spending, <b>feebates</b> allow the public to encourage responsible environmental stewardship and require that the theft of public and private property through environmental destruction does not go without consequences.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantages}} of a feebate over a gas tax is that the feebate only applies to new cars and it is revenue neutral to the car industry. If CAFE fleets are used, <b>feebates</b> would start very close to revenue neutral for each manufacturer.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Feebate</b> is a {{portmanteau}} of [...] "fee" [...] and [...] "rebate". A <b>feebate</b> {{program is}} a self-financing system of fees and rebates {{that are used to}} shift the costs of externalities produced by the private expropriation, fraudulent abstraction, or outright destruction of public goods onto those market actors responsible. Originally coined in the 1970s by Arthur H. Rosenfeld, <b>feebate</b> programs have typically been used to shift buying habits in the transportation and energy sectors.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} a <b>feebate</b> is {{proposed}} in the Rocky Mountain Institute’s 2004 publication, “Winning the Oil Endgame”. For each class of car and light truck, a <b>feebate</b> mechanism is used to reward buyers of vehicles that are more fuel efficient than the average vehicle in that class and penalize buyers of less fuel efficient vehicles. This <b>feebate</b> is revenue-neutral, meaning {{that the amount of}} money collected through fees (surcharges) equals the amount paid out in rebates.|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} welfare effects in {{equilibrium}} of two environmental regulations that aim at increasing the new cars fleet’s average fuel efficiency: the {{fuel economy standards}} and the <b>feebate</b> policies. Maintaining the same environmental benefit and tax revenue, we simulate the implementation of each policy in France and the United States. Standard-type policies have larger negative welfare effects, up to 3. 2 times those from the <b>feebate.</b> Effects on manufacturers are heterogeneous: some are better of under the standard regulation. The addition of a market to trade levels of fuel efficiency dominates the simple standard regulation but not always the <b>feebate.</b> We also consider the attribute-based standard, technological improvements, and the equivalence with fuel taxes as extensions...|$|R
50|$|Supporters point towards {{what they}} feel are feebates' {{tendency}} to promote personal responsibility by having {{those responsible for the}} involuntary expropriation (by means of force and fraud) of public goods from the public—and each and every private individual—by destruction of the environment or other negligent behavior towards private and public property, by having polluters pay for the externalities that they impose upon society. In the case of personal cars, <b>feebates</b> share some of the same aims as fuel taxes, vehicle registration fees, congestion charging, and road pricing.|$|E
50|$|It {{is claimed}} <b>feebates</b> are {{generally}} {{a more efficient}} way of promoting greater fuel efficiency and other socially-desirable outcomes than traditional taxes or quotas. Fuel taxes create important price signals that can make consumers aware of the non-internalized costs of fuel consumption (greenhouse gasses, other pollution) — and raise funds to offset this externality. But retail consumers have very high discount rates, meaning buyers do {{not take into account}} the additional cost high gasoline taxes or poor gas mileage when purchasing a car. A feebate internalizes that cost into the initial purchase price, thereby requiring the buyer to prepay for the taking of public and private environmental goods.|$|E
40|$|A growing {{majority}} of climate scientists {{are convinced that}} unless emissions are reduced, global warming would cause a number of adverse effects throughout the United States. In California, rising temperatures would reduce the snow pack in the Sierra-the state's primary source of water-and lead to less water for irrigating farms in the Central Valley. Global warming would {{increase the number of}} extreme heat days and greatly increase the risk of poor air quality across the state. California's 1, 100 miles of coastline and coastal communities are vulnerable to rising sea levels. Concerted action could curb global warming, but all sectors would need to take immediate steps to reduce heattrapping pollution. In California, the transportation sector consumes well over half the oil used statewide, and passenger cars and trucks emit 20 to 30 percent of the state's global warming pollution. Vehicles therefore are a central focus of the immediate action required to reduce global warming. The state of California's regulatory approach involves phasing in limits to average global warming emissions from passenger cars and trucks beginning in 2009 and culminating in 2016. This regulation is often called "Pavley," after its author, Assemblywoman Fran Pavley. The federal government's approach provides tax incentives to buyers of hybrid vehicles, which emit significantly lower amounts of global warming pollution than most conventional vehicles. However, the hybrid incentive affects {{only a small portion of}} the vehicle market. A third approach that could be used to enhance or replace existing regulations would be a <b>feebates</b> program. A <b>feebates</b> program creates a schedule of both fees and rebates that reflects the amount of global warming pollution that different vehicles emit. Purchasers of new vehicles that emit larger amounts of heat-trapping emissions pay a one-time surcharge at the point of purchase. These surcharges are then used to provide rebates to buyers of new vehicles that emit less pollution. A <b>feebates</b> program has several advantages over other approaches: Market-oriented: A <b>feebates</b> program recognizes the power of price signals to change consumer behavior. That is, incentives spur consumers to purchase and manufactures to produce cleaner vehicles. Self-financing: A <b>feebates</b> program can be designed so that the surcharges collected equal the rebates paid. Affects entire market: A <b>feebates</b> program applies to all new vehicles-clean and dirty-spurring a transformation of the entire market. Consumer choice: A <b>feebates</b> program can be designed so that consumers have the option to buy vehicles that carry no surcharge in each vehicle class, such as cars, trucks, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and minivans. This study explores the economic impacts on consumers and manufacturers of the existing Pavley regulation and a <b>feebates</b> program by analyzing four alternative scenarios, using information from 2002 as the base year. Our findings show that a <b>feebates</b> program is an effective strategy to reduce global warming pollution by up to 25 % more than Pavley alone. Also, under a <b>feebates</b> program consumers will save thousands of dollars and retailers will see their revenue rise by as much as 6 %. ...|$|E
30|$|In December 2007, France {{established}} a <b>feebate</b> scheme. The scheme provides a rebate {{of up to}} € 5000 for vehicles with CO 2 emissions below 60  g/km (e.g. electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids) and charges fess of up to € 2600 for cars with CO 2 emissions above 250  g/km. According to official figures, the scheme has been very successful, with sales of vehicles with CO 2 emissions lower than 130  g/km increasing 45  % in the scheme’s first 8  months. A number of ex-ante estimates have {{been made of the}} policy potential of <b>feebate</b> schemes. A <b>feebate</b> scheme of US$ 1000 for every 0.01 gallon per mile improvement, if introduced in the United States for 1  year and then ceased, would increase the efficiency of the light vehicle fleet by 24  % over the following 10 to 15  years [26]. Langer (2005) estimated that a <b>feebate</b> of US$ 1825 /gallon/ 100 mi (4.25  L/km) would reduce the average fuel consumption of vehicles entering the fleet 16  % by 2010 and 28  % by 2020.|$|R
50|$|To {{understand}} how a <b>feebate</b> works {{it is easier to}} break the <b>feebate</b> into the fee and rebate components. The fee could be compared to a gasoline tax that was paid when the vehicle is first purchased. Suppose the fee was set at $0.10 per gallon for the first 100,000 miles. A 20MPG car would have a fee of 100,000 mi / 20MPG * $0.10 = $500. Upgrading this car to 25MPG would reduce the fee to $400. If the upgrade costs less than the $100 savings this change would be beneficial to both producer and consumer and would be adopted.|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of countries have implemented or are evaluating feebate systems {{in order to reduce}} energy consumption of new vehicle registrations. We distinguish between absolute <b>feebates</b> based strictly on a vehicle's energy consumption and relative <b>feebates</b> normalizing energy consumption by a given car utility. This paper analyzes whether absolute or relative <b>feebates</b> encourage more consumers to change to vehicles with lower energy consumption. We combine an analysis of all car models on sale at the end of 2005 with survey data from 326 potential new car buyers. Analysis of the car fleet with regard to behavioral changes assumed as realistic shows that relative systems succeed better in offering more consumer groups cars that are eligible for incentives. Survey results suggest that consumers show some, but limited, willingness to change behavior to obtain an incentive. However, a relative system potentially allows people to switch to cars with higher relative efficiency without actually lowering absolute CO 2 emissions. We discuss this inherent dilemma of simultaneously addressing more consumers and limiting counteracting effects. In order to find the optimal trade-off, we suggest assessing different parameters operationalizing vehicle utility by means of micro-simulation with detailed car fleet and differentiated consumer segments. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} costs and {{effectiveness}} of several energy policies for light-duty motor vehicles in the United States, using the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS). The policies addressed are higher fuel taxes, tighter vehicle efficiency standards, and financial subsidies and penalties {{for the purchase of}} high- and low-efficiency vehicles (<b>feebates).</b> I find that tightening fuel-efficiency standards beyond those currently mandated through 2016, or imposing <b>feebates</b> designed to accomplish similar changes, can achieve by 2030 reductions in energy use by all light-duty passenger vehicles of 7. 1 to 8. 4 percent. A stronger feebate policy has somewhat greater effects, but at a significantly higher unit cost. High fuel taxes, on the order of $ 2. 00 per gallon (2007 $), have somewhat greater effects, arguably more favorable cost-effectiveness ratios, and produce their effects much more quickly because they affect the usage rate of both new and used vehicles. Policy costs vary greatly with assumptions about the reason for the apparent myopia commonly observed in consumer demand for fuel efficiency, and with the inclusion or exclusion of ancillary costs of congestion, local air pollution, and accidents.

40|$|After the Kyoto Conference (COP 3), the Japanese {{transport}} sector {{was required to}} reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions by 16 % by 2010. The Japanese government has decided to improve the fuel economy standard in 2010 by improving it {{by an average of}} 22. 8 %. However, Japanese consumers tend to prefer heavier passenger cars such as four-wheel drive or recreational vehicles. Because of the difficult target of COP 3, environmental policy should involve not only automotive technologies but also non-technical measures. Since Japanese vehicle taxes are expensive compared to other OECD countries, we would like to introduce the “feebate”, a word composed from “fee” and “rebate”, as a “Green Tax” at the acquisition stage. The <b>feebate</b> system charges a fee for less fuel-efficient vehicles and refunds for vehicles more fuel efficient than the fuel efficiency standard. This system is a market based alternative by fuel efficiency standards {{so that it can be}} tax neutral. Acquisition tax does not affect to environmental sustainability. Since social marginal cost has increased more and more, it is not always realistic to impose all the costs at the motoring tax level. The <b>feebate</b> system could partially share the social marginal cost and might mitigate the rebound effect at the motoring stage. We use the data set from 1995 - 2001 on fuel efficiency by vehicle type and the fuel efficiency standards of 1995.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2008 was introduced in France a <b>feebate</b> on the purchase of new cars called the “Bonus/Malus”. Since January 2008, the less polluting cars benefited from a price reduction of up to 1, 000 euros, while the most polluting ones were subject to a taxation of 2, 600 euros. We estimate {{the impact of this}} policy on carbon dioxide emissions in the short and long run. These emissions depend on the market shares and the average emissions per kilometer of each car, but also on their manufacturing and the number of kilometers traveled by their owners. We first develop a simple tractable model that relates car choice and mileage. We then estimate this model, using both the exhaustive dataset of car registrations and a recent transportation survey which provides information on individual journeys. We show that if the shift towards the classes benefiting from rebates is spectacular, the environmental impact of the policy is negative. The reform has notably increased sales, leading to an important increase in manufacturing and traveling emissions. We thus stress that such policies may be efficient tools for reducing CO 2 emissions (French consumers do react to the <b>feebate</b> in their car choice), but should be designed with care to achieve their primary goal...|$|R

To minimize the funds necessary for such a reward we allow the drivers removed from the peak to use the bottleneck just before or just after the remaining peak hour.

The European Commission considers it essential to differentiate taxes, rewarding energy efficient cars with significantly lower taxes and imposing considerable taxes on cars with poor fuel efficiency. [...].) found that replacing existing vehicle taxes with taxes dependant on only CO 2 emissions, with sufficient differentiation, led to the largest reductions. Where differentiated taxes already exist, adding a CO 2 emissions dependant element provides smaller, but still significant reductions. For example, the Irish CO 2 emissions-differentiated vehicle tax is estimated to have resulted in a 3.6 – 3.8  % emissions intensity reduction and an annual reduction of transport CO 2 emissions of 3  % [21]. Under a <b>feebate</b> system, the rate of progression is being increased over time, and thus lead to even greater CO 2 emissions reduction, but significant savings also could be achieved by increasing the differentiation of existing taxes.|$|R
30|$|By {{imposing}} {{higher taxes}} on the purchase of less efficient vehicles, registration taxes influence consumer behaviour directly {{at the point of}} vehicle sale. Denmark’s purchase-tax system led to an average fuel efficiency increase of 4.1  l/ 100  km for diesel light vehicles and 0.6  l/ 100  km for petrol [74]. Purchase or registration taxes are highly visible, which is very helpful in steering buyers’ decisions towards more efficient vehicles and may also result in lower car ownership rates: a 10  % increase in car registration taxes would reduce car ownership in European cities by about 1.4  % [74], which would, in turn, result in lower overall car use and a higher share of more efficient modes in urban areas. However, there may be negative welfare or equity implications [27]. Taxes imposed {{at the time of the}} first registration may also delay the renewal of the vehicle fleet, as car owners may keep their vehicles longer and may prefer to replace current vehicle with other used rather than new ones. An ex-post assessment of the Netherland’s <b>feebates</b> estimated the scheme saved approximately 0.6 - 1  m tonnes of CO 2 per annum [28], approximately 2 – 3  % of the Netherland’s total transport sector CO 2 emissions. The Dutch system’s provision of direct incentives to buy very efficient cars has had a measurable effect on purchasing decisions, with the market share of cars from the highest efficiency class increasing from 0.3 to 3.2  %, and that for the second highest class increasing from 9.5 to 16.1  % in 2002 [90]. Following the government’s decision to discontinue the <b>feebates,</b> efficient cars’ market share dropped almost instantly, although it stayed higher than before the scheme’s introduction [74].|$|E
40|$|Since 1975, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{program has}} been the main policy tool in the US for coping with the {{problems}} of increasing fuel consumption and dependence on imported oil. The program mandates average fuel economy requirements for the new vehicle sales of each manufacturer's fleet, with separate standards for cars and light trucks. The fact that each manufacturer must on its own meet the standards means that the incentives to improve fuel economy are different across manufacturers and vehicle types, although the problems associated with fuel consumption do not make such distinctions. This paper evaluates different mechanisms to offer automakers the flexibility of joint compliance with nationwide fuel economy goals: tradable CAFE credits, <b>feebates,</b> output-rebated fees, and tradable credits with banking.

With inelastic demand, a fine (time-varying) reward is equivalent to a fine toll, and to a continuum of combinations of time-varying tolls and rewards (including fine <b>feebates).</b> When demand is price sensitive, a reward becomes less attractive from the efficiency viewpoint, because it attracts additional users to the congested bottleneck. As a result, both the second-best optimal rate {{of participation in the}} scheme, and the relative efficiency that can be achieved with it, decreases when demand becomes more elastic. Our analytical and simulation results for coarse schemes suggest that a coarse reward is less effective than a coarse feebate, which is itself less effective than a coarse toll.

40|$|Fiscal {{policies}} {{are used to}} improve vehicle fuel efficiency and reduce CO 2 emissions in the transport sector. Years of forceful reform in Norway {{may be seen as}} informative. From 2007, Norway has linked its new vehicle registration tax to CO 2 intensities, later adapting it into a <b>feebate</b> form. We exploit a detailed dataset of new vehicle registrations, using fixed effects and instrumental variables in our econometric analysis. We find that the CO 2 differentiated registration tax contributes significantly to shifting purchases towards low-emitting cars. A 1000 NOK tax increase (about 120 USD) is associated with a reduction of 1. 13 % - 1. 58 % in vehicle registrations, and the responsiveness in car choice to fuel costs is of the same magnitude. The estimated effect of the tax explains the majority (79 %) of the reduction in average CO 2 intensity in the new car fleet 2006 through 2011. A point estimate of the elasticity of the CO 2 intensity with respect to the CO 2 price is minus 0. 06, whereas the elasticity with respect to (resulting) car prices is about minus 0. 5. An intuitive model with ‘all’ car types losing demand to low-emitting types applies fairly well: low-emitting segments gain in share and do not get CO 2 leaner, while high-emitting segments lose in share and become CO 2 leaner.

For instance, the review by Sims et al. [37] presents carbon abatement costs for various technological measures but provide only qualitative analysis of the behavioural measures. The research by Dedinec et al. [8] is a rare exception as it considers the CO 2 reduction potential and associated cost savings of driver behaviour and travel behaviour, i.e. using public transport on commuting trips and walking and cycling short distances. These measures were found to be highly cost effective, but Dedinec et al. [8] did not consider the infrastructure investments or increased operational costs of public transport, which are likely to be needed to promote the behavioural change. AlSabbagn et al. [2] studied the CO 2 abatement costs of public transport investment in the case of introducing light rail and bus rapid transport in Bahrain, considering the capital as well as the maintenance costs, and found the costs high compared to the estimated CO 2 reduction.|$|R
40|$|This report explores {{public opinion}} on a new and {{promising}} concept—green transportation taxes and fees. These are taxes and fees set at variable rates, with higher rates for more polluting vehicles and lower rates for those that pollute less. This approach to transportation taxes and fees adapts the traditional transportation finance system to achieve two critical public benefits at once: encouraging drivers to choose more environmentally-friendly transportation options and raising revenue for needed transportation programs. To test public support for green transportation taxes and fees, the authors conducted a random telephone survey of 1, 500 Californians that asked respondents their views on five hypothetical tax and fee options: a flat-rate and a green vehicle registration fee, a flat-rate and a green mileage fee, and a “feebate” program for new vehicle purchases under which more-polluting vehicles would be charged a tax and less-polluting vehicles would receive a rebate. The survey {{results show that the}} concept of green transportation taxes and fees strongly appeals to Californians. The survey tested this in two ways: by testing support for the three hypothetical green transportation tax and fee policies, and also by comparing support levels for flat-rate versus green versions of two taxes. Majorities of the respondents supported all three green taxes and fees tested. Another striking finding from the survey is that support for the green taxes and fees did not vary greatly by population subgroups; a diverse range of Californians supported the green taxes and fees. An analysis comparing support for the green and flat-rate vehicle registration fee and <b>feebate</b> proposals confirmed that in every subgroup, more people within that subgroup supported the green than the flat version of the two taxes tested...|$|R
