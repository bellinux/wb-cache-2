A number of monochrome photographs were taken and a few seaweeds were collected, but no species record was created for other types of oceanic life around Bowie Seamount.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} pyjama shark as Near Threatened, citing its small {{distribution}} {{and a recent}} increase in fishing pressure on small sharks in the region. However, {{there is no evidence}} to suggest that its population has declined. There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species, though its range encompasses two marine reserves. The South African Sea <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Research</b> Institute is considering legally decommercializing the pyjama shark, which would limit the degree to which it can be targeted by commercial fisheries.|$|E

25|$|Research vessels – a <b>fisheries</b> <b>research</b> vessel (FRV) {{requires}} platforms {{which are}} capable of towing different types of fishing nets, collecting plankton or water samples {{from a range of}} depths, and carrying acoustic fish-finding equipment. <b>Fisheries</b> <b>research</b> vessels are often designed and built along the same lines as a large fishing vessel, but with space given over to laboratories and equipment storage, as opposed to storage of the catch.

40|$|It is {{impossible}} to place a date on the beginning of <b>fishery</b> <b>research.</b> It no doubt existed in a primitive way among the earliest civilizations. For practical reasons, {{the scope of this}} paper is limited to the four countries bordering the North Pacific [...] Japan, Canada, Russia and the United States [...] and to research directed towards a better understanding and management of the fishery resources of commercial value. It is interesting that development of <b>fishery</b> <b>research</b> in three of the four countries was prompted by a serious decline in their salmon runs and by the adoption of hatcheries as a means to restore or maintain the depleted runs. The only difference was in Russia where <b>fishery</b> <b>research</b> began with a decline in sturgeon in the Volga and the Caspian Sea. In the Russian Far East, however, it again was a decline in salmon in the Amur and Sakhalin rivers and all were linked primarily to loss or damage to their freshwater environment. Overfishing and destructive fishing practices were recognized almost from the beginning {{but it was not until}} 1917 that the work of Thompson on Pacific halibut led to the development of modern theory of population dynamics for the management of the fisheries. Following are notes on the development of <b>fishery</b> <b>research</b> in each of the four countries...|$|R
