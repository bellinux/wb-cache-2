2500|$|In 1828, Alexander Ferguson Reid {{inherited}} the estate, {{he was known}} as the [...] "Ayrshire Genius" [...] and was an inventor and collector of antiquities, as well as geological and natural history specimens. Reid dug into this Druidical Mound or Moot Hill several times and found nothing to help explain its age or purpose. Most maps do not show the ice house which lies to the east of the driveway and some confusion in the descriptions may have arisen from misidentification of the ice house, limekiln and the Hutt Knowe. In the grounds of the present farm are curved ditches which are shown to have <b>held</b> <b>water,</b> either as ornamental ponds or for some practical purpose now unknown. The site had an apple orchard within the last 50 years or so, for John Hastings remembers raiding it.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the phase}} one section is navigable by broad-beamed boats, the phase two section will only {{accommodate}} narrow boats. The re-profiled channel has sloping sides, which benefit wildlife {{but do not}} allow mooring, and so three [...] mooring recesses have been built.

The rewatered section runs eastwards from Drayton Beauchamp, rather than connecting to the section which is already navigable, and a further [...] is expected to be rewatered during 2016. To speed up progress, the Trust considered using contractors for some of the work, and in November 2015 submitted a claim for a grant of Â£1.9 million to the Heritage Lottery Fund.|$|E
2500|$|The Windover dig {{site is a}} small pond, about [...] in area, {{that has}} <b>held</b> <b>water</b> {{continuously}} since sometime between 9000 and 8000 BC. It is next to the Atlantic coastal ridge about [...] from Cape Canaveral. As the sea level was considerably lower 7,000 to 8,000 years ago than it is today, the pond originally sat above the water table, and was filled only by rainfall and runoff from the surrounding land. At that time the pond had a relatively thin layer of peat under {{a thin layer of}} water. The subsequent rise in sea level raised the local water table, and in more recent times the pond has been fed by groundwater as well as rainfall. In 1984 the pond had a thick layer of peat, with five strata described by the archaeologists who excavated the pond. The peat {{in the center of the}} pond was covered by [...] of water.|$|E

2500|$|The second torpedo struck {{about three-quarters}} of the way along the ship, just outside the rear limit of the side armour plating. The torpedo punched through {{the side of the}} ship before {{exploding}} in the aft machine room. The explosion tore upward through two messes and a relaxation area called [...] "the Soda Fountain" [...] before finally ripping a 20-metre-long hole in the main deck. Later reports put the number of deaths in the area around the explosion at 275 men. After the explosion, the ship rapidly filled with smoke. The explosion also damaged [...] General Belgranos electrical power system, preventing her from putting out a radio distress call. Though the forward bulkheads <b>held,</b> <b>water</b> was rushing in through the hole created by the second torpedo and could not be pumped out because of the electrical power failure. In addition, although the ship should have been [...] "at action stations", she was sailing with the water-tight doors open.|$|E
2500|$|Even with {{artificial}} reefs in place, a tourist's vacation time may coincide with a [...] "flat spell", when no waves are available. Completely artificial Wave pools aim {{to solve that}} problem by controlling all the elements that go into creating perfect surf, however {{there are only a}} handful of wave pools that can simulate good surfing waves, owing primarily to construction and operation costs and potential liability. Most wave pools generate waves that are too small and lack the power necessary to surf. The Seagaia Ocean Dome, located in Miyazaki, Japan, was an example of a surfable wave pool. Able to generate waves with up to 10-foot faces, the specialized pump <b>held</b> <b>water</b> in 20 vertical tanks positioned along the back edge of the pool. This allowed the waves to be directed as they approach the artificial sea floor. Lefts, Rights, and A-frames could be directed from this pump design providing for rippable surf and barrel rides. The Ocean Dome cost about $2nbsp&billion to build and was expensive to maintain. The Ocean Dome was closed in 2007. In England, construction is nearing completion on the Wave, situated near Bristol, which will enable people unable to get to the coast to enjoy the waves in a controlled environment, set in the heart of nature.|$|E
2500|$|In retrospect, the {{majority}} of Leskov's legacy, documentary in essence, {{could be seen as}} part of the 19th century raznochintsy literature which relied upon the 'real life sketch' as a founding genre. But, while Gleb Uspensky, Vasily Sleptsov and Fyodor Reshetnikov were preaching [...] "the urgent need to study the real life of the common people," [...] Leskov was caustic in his scorn: [...] "Never could I understand this popular idea among our publicists of 'studying' the life of the common people, for I felt it would be more natural for a writer to 'live' this kind of life, rather than 'study' it," [...] he remarked. With his thorough knowledge of the Russian provinces, competence in every nuance of the industrial, agricultural and religious spheres, including obscure regional, sectarian or ethnic nuances, Leskov regarded his colleagues on the radical left as cabinet theoreticians, totally rootless in their [...] "studies". Leskov was not indifferent to social injustice, according to Bukhstab. [...] "It was just that he viewed social problems as a strict practitioner for whom only personal experience was worthy of trust while none of the theories based on philosophical doctrines <b>held</b> <b>water.</b> Unlike the Social Democrats, Leskov neither believed in the possibility of an agrarian revolution in Russia, nor wanted it to happen, seeing education and enlightenment, often of religious nature, as the factors for social improvement," [...] wrote the biographer.|$|E

Down the cords of my neck and into my patch of chest over the heart darting pains were making their way.
