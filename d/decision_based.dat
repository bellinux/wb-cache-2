5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation originates from common law principles of fairness. English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers. Generally, the courts will grant {{judicial review of}} an administrative <b>decision</b> <b>based</b> on an individual's legitimate expectation if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers. The individual has {{to show that the}} representation was a clear and unambiguous promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best <b>decision</b> <b>based</b> on their own values.|$|E

We compare our method with a dynamic network formation process proposed in the economics literature that relies on a global computation over the entire network structure.

5|$|Terceira {{argued that}} she had a second horse, Chaka III, who should have been used in the injured Navantus' place, was {{regularly}} faster than Nisbett's Antille 8 and should have earned the qualification position. She also accused the Bermuda Equestrian Federation of making the <b>decision</b> <b>based</b> on political or racial motivations, which the organization denied. BEF president Mike Cherry explained that Chaka III did not qualify for the event until June 30, the final day, which is the reason why the horse was not considered for Bermuda's Olympic slot. The BEF organized a final day of competition between Nisbett's Antille and Terceira's Chaka to give Terceira one last opportunity to qualify for an Olympic position. Nisbett, however, withdrew from the Olympic position later that June. Terceira took his place.|$|E
5|$|The final Delrina-branded {{version of}} WinFax was WinFax PRO 7.0, which shipped in late 1995, the {{subsequent}} version 8.0 being a Symantec product. There was no intervening version 5.0 or 6.0, and the jump to version 7.0 was purely a marketing <b>decision,</b> <b>based</b> on {{keeping up with}} the suite of products in Microsoft Office which were then at the same number.

In other cases the appearance of the structure may take on greater importance and so influence the design decisions beyond mere matters of economics. Modern materials such as prestressed concrete and fabrication methods, such as automated welding, have significantly influenced the design of modern bridges.|$|E

30|$|Thirdly, if {{managers}} make <b>decisions</b> <b>based</b> {{on their}} firm’s current statutory tax status, higher debt figures would be observed for companies with greater differences between their {{statutory tax rate}} and marginal tax rate. Therefore, we construct a TAX DIFFERENCE variable as per Graham (1996 a) and Sinha and Bansal (2013), {{which is the result}} of the statutory tax rate minus the marginal tax rate. According to this rationale, we expect this tax difference variable to be positively related to debt usage if companies make tax-based leverage <b>decisions</b> <b>based</b> on their statutory tax rates. Conversely, the coefficient on this variable will be zero or non-significant if firms make tax-based leverage <b>decisions</b> <b>based</b> exclusively on simulated marginal tax rates. We have used the lagged values of this variable, and we have controlled for the marginal tax rate in the regression though it is dropped due to collinearity. Table 6 reports the estimation results and shows companies make debt <b>decisions</b> <b>based</b> on their marginal tax rate and not the statutory tax rate.|$|R

The 8AF made no more deep penetrations in clear weather into Germany {{for the rest of}} the year. That failure was, prior to December, the result of a command <b>decision</b> <b>based</b> on the lack of escort fighters, and the need for recuperating the bomber force after its losses on 14 October.|$|E

25|$|The {{vertical}} tail or vertical stabilizer of a multi-engine aircraft plays {{a crucial role}} in maintaining directional control while an engine fails or is inoperative. The larger the tail, the more capable it will be of providing the required force to counteract the asymmetrical thrust yawing moment. This means that the smaller the tail is, the higher the VMCA will be. However, a larger tail is more costly and harder to accommodate, and comes with other aerodynamic issues such as increased prevalence of slipstreams. Engineers designing the {{vertical tail}} must make a <b>decision</b> <b>based</b> on, amongst other factors, their budget, the weight of the aircraft, and the maximum bank angle of 5° (away from the inoperative engine), as stated by FAR.|$|E
25|$|Although much {{of nursing}} ethics can appear similar to medical ethics, {{there are some}} factors that {{differentiate}} it. Breier-Mackie suggests that nurses' focus on care and nurture, rather than cure of illness, results in a distinctive ethics. Furthermore, nursing ethics emphasizes the ethics of everyday practice rather than moral dilemmas. Nursing ethics {{is more concerned with}} developing the caring relationship than broader principles, such as beneficence and justice. For example, a concern to promote beneficence may be expressed in traditional medical ethics by the exercise of paternalism, where the health professional makes a <b>decision</b> <b>based</b> upon a perspective of acting in the patient's best interests. However, it is argued by some that this approach acts against person-centred values found in nursing ethics.|$|E
