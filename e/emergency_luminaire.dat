40|$|This paper summarises {{progress}} made towards the radiation hardening of LED <b>emergency</b> <b>luminaires</b> for evacuation and emergency response within the underground {{areas of the}} CERN accelerator complex. The objective has been to radiation harden existing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) <b>emergency</b> <b>luminaires</b> to maximise lighting performance, without compromising IEC 60598 - 2 - 22 compliance. A systems level approach has been adopted, leading {{to the development of}} a diode bridge based AC/DC power converter. Modified COTS luminaires including this converter design have been irradiated (to 100 kGy TID using a Cobalt- 60 source), with results of a subsequent photometric analysis presented. Following encouraging tests results, a reference design for the power converter has been released under the CERN Open Hardware License to encourage manufacturer adoption. The paper concludes with areas of interest for future research in further improving the radiation hardness of LED emergency lighting for accelerators with detailed studies at the component level for high power white LED devices and associated optical components.

50|$|Maxspid was {{the first}} local company to {{manufacture}} emergency lighting, and now manufactures products varying from <b>emergency</b> exit <b>luminaires</b> to <b>emergency</b> kits and peripherals.|$|R
40|$|Emergency Lighting: For Industrial, Commercial and Residential Premises {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the provision of emergency lighting to facilitate exit routes for people in industrial, commercial, and residential areas. The book covers important topics such as the objectives of emergency lighting systems; the identification of safe routes under low lighting in different areas; and related devices such as <b>luminaires,</b> <b>emergency</b> signs, and way-guidance. Also discussed are the applications of emergency lighting; factors to consider {{in the design of}} emergency lighting; electrical installations; and te...|$|R
