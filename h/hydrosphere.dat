5|$|A region's {{climate is}} {{generated}} by the climate system, which has five components: atmosphere, <b>hydrosphere,</b> cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere.|$|E
5|$|After Miranda, Ariel is the second-smallest of Uranus' {{five major}} rounded {{satellites}} and the second-closest to its planet. Among {{the smallest of}} the Solar System's 19 known spherical moons (it ranks 14th among them in diameter), it is believed to be composed of roughly equal parts ice and rocky material. Its mass is approximately equal in magnitude to Earth's <b>hydrosphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|Earth (1 AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is the largest}} and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current {{geological}} activity, and {{the only place where}} life is known to exist. Its liquid <b>hydrosphere</b> is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere is radically {{different from those of the}} other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{demonstrates that the}} continents of the Earth are moving across the surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a <b>hydrosphere.</b> With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction {{for at least the next}} 1.1 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong as on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer <b>hydrosphere,</b> according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or watery planet would be at least 1.25 times as strong as on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{lithosphere}} {{is divided}} into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water {{that contribute to the}} <b>hydrosphere.</b> The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|The {{biosphere}} is {{the part}} of Earth's outer shell– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere– within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), <b>hydrosphere</b> (water), and atmosphere (air). The entire Earth contains over 75billion tons (150 trillion pounds or about 6.8×1013kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.) and 455billion kg (between 845billion and 975billion lb, or about 423million–488million short tons). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8x1013kg (75billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} low vapour pressure, PCBs {{accumulate}} {{primarily in the}} <b>hydrosphere,</b> despite their hydrophobicity, in the organic fraction of soil, and in organisms. The <b>hydrosphere</b> is the main reservoir. The immense volume {{of water in the}} oceans is still capable of dissolving a significant quantity of PCBs.|$|E
25|$|The {{carbon cycle}} is the {{biogeochemical}} cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, <b>hydrosphere,</b> and {{atmosphere of the}} Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{water cycle}} (known scientifically as the hydrologic cycle) {{refers to the}} {{continuous}} exchange of water within the <b>hydrosphere,</b> between the atmosphere, soil water, surface water, groundwater, and plants.|$|E
25|$|The {{collective}} mass {{of water}} found on, under, {{and over the}} surface of a planet is called the <b>hydrosphere.</b> Earth's approximate water volume (the total water supply of the world) is 1,338,000,000km3 (321,000,000mi3).|$|E
25|$|The geology {{of solar}} {{terrestrial}} planets mainly {{deals with the}} geological aspects of the four terrestrial planets of the Solar System, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, and one terrestrial dwarf planet, Ceres. Only one terrestrial planet, Earth, {{is known to have}} an active <b>hydrosphere.</b>|$|E
25|$|Earth science {{generally}} recognizes 4 spheres, the lithosphere, the <b>hydrosphere,</b> the atmosphere, and {{the biosphere}} as correspondent to rocks, water, air, and life respectively. Some scientists include, {{as part of}} the spheres of the Earth, the cryosphere (corresponding to ice) as a distinct portion of the <b>hydrosphere,</b> as well as the pedosphere (corresponding to soil) as an active and intermixed sphere. Earth science (also known as geoscience, the geosciences or the Earth Sciences), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth. There are four major disciplines in earth sciences, namely geography, geology, geophysics and geodesy. These major disciplines use physics, chemistry, biology, chronology and mathematics to build a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the principal areas or spheres of Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{phosphorus}} {{cycle is}} {{the movement of}} phosphorus through the lithosphere, <b>hydrosphere,</b> and biosphere. The atmosphere does not {{play a significant role}} in the movements of phosphorus, because phosphorus and phosphorus compounds are usually solids at the typical ranges of temperature and pressure found on Earth.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{discipline of}} astrogeology is geochemistry, which involves {{study of the}} chemical composition of the Earth and other planets, chemical processes and reactions that govern the composition of rocks and soils, the cycles of matter and energy and their interaction with the <b>hydrosphere</b> and {{the atmosphere of the}} planet. Specializations include cosmochemistry, biochemistry and organic geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Being a {{component}} of Earth's <b>hydrosphere</b> and hydrologic cycle, it is particularly abundant in Earth's atmosphere where {{it is also a}} potent greenhouse gas along with other gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Use of water vapor, as steam, has been important to humans for cooking and as a major component in energy production and transport systems since the industrial revolution.|$|E
25|$|Aquifer {{drawdown}} or overdrafting and the pumping {{of fossil}} water increases {{the total amount}} of water within the <b>hydrosphere</b> subject to transpiration and evaporation processes, thereby causing accretion in water vapour and cloud cover, the primary absorbers of infrared radiation in the earth's atmosphere. Adding water to the system has a forcing effect on the whole earth system, an accurate estimate of which hydrogeological fact is yet to be quantified.|$|E
25|$|Since {{nail polish}} remover is a solvent, it will {{dissolve}} in water. When acetone dissolves in water, it hydrogen bonds with water. The more nail polish remover that enters the <b>hydrosphere</b> {{will increase the}} concentration of acetone and then increase the concentration of the solution created when acetone and water bonds. If enough nail polish remover is disposed, it can reach the lethal dose level for aquatic life.|$|E
25|$|The {{biosphere}} is {{the global}} {{sum of all}} ecosystems. It can also be termed as the zone of life on Earth, a closed system (apart from solar and cosmic radiation and heat from {{the interior of the}} Earth), and largely self-regulating. By the most general biophysiological definition, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere, geosphere, <b>hydrosphere,</b> and atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|A {{carbon dioxide}} sink {{such as a}} {{concentrated}} group of plants or any other primary producer that binds carbon dioxide into biomass, such as within forests and kelp beds, is not carbon negative, as sinks are not permanent. A carbon dioxide sink of this type moves carbon, {{in the form of}} carbon dioxide, from the atmosphere or <b>hydrosphere</b> to the biosphere. This process could be undone, for example by wildfires or logging.|$|E
25|$|Water vapor, {{water vapour}} or aqueous vapor is the gaseous phase of water. It is one state of water within the <b>hydrosphere.</b> Water vapor can be {{produced}} from the evaporation or boiling of liquid water or from the sublimation of ice. Unlike other forms of water, water vapor is invisible. Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by condensation. It is lighter than air and triggers convection currents {{that can lead to}} clouds.|$|E
25|$|As {{the world}} ocean is the {{principal}} component of Earth's <b>hydrosphere,</b> it is integral to life, forms part of the carbon cycle, and influences climate and weather patterns. The world ocean is the habitat of 230,000 known species, but because {{much of it is}} unexplored, the number of species that exist in the ocean is much larger, possibly over two million. The origin of Earth's oceans is unknown; oceans are thought to have formed in the Hadean eon and may have been the impetus for the emergence of life.|$|E
25|$|Gaseous {{signaling}} molecules are gaseous {{molecules that}} are either synthesised internally (endogenously) in the organism, tissue or cell or are received by the organism, tissue or cell from outside (say, from the atmosphere or <b>hydrosphere,</b> {{as in the case}} of oxygen) and that are used to transmit chemical signals which induce certain physiological or biochemical changes in the organism, tissue or cell. The term is applied to, for example, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, methane, hydrogen, ethylene, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{carbon cycle}} is the {{biogeochemical}} cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, <b>hydrosphere,</b> and {{atmosphere of the}} Earth. Carbon is {{the main component of}} biological compounds as well as a major component of many minerals such as limestone. Along with the nitrogen cycle and the water cycle, the carbon cycle comprises a sequence of events that are key to make Earth capable of sustaining life. It describes the movement of carbon as it is recycled and reused throughout the biosphere, as well as long-term processes of carbon sequestration to and release from carbon sinks.|$|E
25|$|Earth science (also {{known as}} geoscience, the geo{{sciences}} or the Earth sciences) is an all-embracing {{term for the}} sciences related to the planet Earth. It is arguably a special case in planetary science, the Earth being the only known life-bearing planet. There are both reductionist and holistic approaches to Earth sciences. The formal discipline of Earth sciences may include {{the study of the}} atmosphere, <b>hydrosphere,</b> oceans and biosphere, as well as the solid earth. Typically Earth scientists will use tools from physics, chemistry, biology, geography, chronology and mathematics to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth system works, and how it evolved to its current state.|$|E
25|$|Present day life on Mars {{could occur}} {{kilometers}} {{below the surface}} in the <b>hydrosphere,</b> or in subsurface geothermal hot spots, or it could occur near the surface. The permafrost layer on Mars is {{only a couple of}} centimeters below the surface. Salty brines can be liquid a few centimeters below that but not far down. Most of the proposed surface habitats are within centimeters of the surface. Water is close to its boiling point even at the deepest points in the Hellas basin, and so cannot remain liquid for long on the surface of Mars in its present state, except when covered in ice or after a sudden release of water.|$|E
25|$|Geobiology is a {{field of}} {{scientific}} research that explores the interactions between the physical Earth and the biosphere. It is a relatively young field, and its borders are fluid. There is considerable overlap with the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, microbiology, paleontology, and particularly biogeochemistry. Geobiology applies the principles and methods of biology and geology {{to the study of}} the ancient history of the co-evolution of life and Earth as well as the role of life in the modern world. Geobiologic studies tend to be focused on microorganisms, and on the role that life plays in altering the chemical and physical environment of the lithosphere, atmosphere, <b>hydrosphere</b> and/or cryosphere. It differs from biogeochemistry in that the focus is on processes and organisms over space and time rather than on global chemical cycles.|$|E
25|$|Jack W. Szostak {{suggested}} that geothermal activity provides greater {{opportunities for the}} origination of life in open lakes {{where there is a}} buildup of minerals. In 2010, based on spectral analysis of sea and hot mineral water, Ignat Ignatov and Oleg Mosin demonstrated that life may have predominantly originated in hot mineral water. The hot mineral water that contains bicarbonate and calcium ions has the most optimal range. This case is similar to the origin of life in hydrothermal vents, but with bicarbonate and calcium ions in hot water. This water has a pH of 9–11 and is possible to have the reactions in seawater. According to Melvin Calvin, certain reactions of condensation-dehydration of amino acids and nucleotides in individual blocks of peptides and nucleic acids can take place in the primary <b>hydrosphere</b> with pH 9-11 at a later evolutionary stage. Some of these compounds like hydrocyanic acid (HCN) have been proven in the experiments of Miller. This is the environment in which the stromatolites have been created. David Ward of Montana State University described the formation of stromatolites in hot mineral water at the Yellowstone National Park. Stromatolites survive in hot mineral water and in proximity to areas with volcanic activity. Processes have evolved in the sea near geysers of hot mineral water. In 2011, Tadashi Sugawara from the University of Tokyo created a protocell in hot water.|$|E
500|$|The {{abundance}} {{of water on}} Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the [...] "Blue Planet" [...] from other planets in the Solar System. Earth's <b>hydrosphere</b> consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down {{to a depth of}} 2,000m. The deepest underwater location is Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of 10,911.4m.|$|E
500|$|An {{ocean is}} a major body of saline water, and a {{principal}} component of the <b>hydrosphere.</b> Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over [...] deep. Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity {{in the range of}} 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water {{often referred to as the}} World Ocean or global ocean. This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography.|$|E
500|$|Extremophiles are {{microorganisms}} {{that have}} adapted {{so that they}} can survive and even thrive in extreme environments that are normally fatal to most life-forms. Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles thrive in high temperatures. Psychrophiles thrive in extremely low temperatures. – Temperatures as high as , as low as [...] Halophiles thrive in high salt conditions, up to saturation. Alkaliphiles thrive in an alkaline pH of about 8.5–11. Acidophiles can thrive in a pH of 2.0 or less. Piezophiles thrive at very high pressures: up to 1,000-2,000 atm, down to 0 atm as in a vacuum of space. A few extremophiles such as Deinococcus radiodurans are radioresistant, resisting radiation exposure of up to 5k Gy. Extremophiles are significant in different ways. They extend terrestrial life into much of the Earth's <b>hydrosphere,</b> crust and atmosphere, their specific evolutionary adaptation mechanisms to their extreme environment can be exploited in biotechnology, and their very existence under such extreme conditions increases the potential for extraterrestrial life.|$|E

2500|$|Earth system science (ESS) is the {{application}} of systems science to the Earth sciences. In particular, it considers interactions between the Earth's [...] "spheres"—atmosphere, <b>hydrosphere,</b> cryosphere, geosphere, pedosphere, biosphere, and, even, the magnetosphere — {{as well as the}} impact of human societies on these components.|$|E
2500|$|Cycled {{repeatedly}} {{through the}} planetary <b>hydrosphere,</b> all water on Earth is recycled water, but the terms [...] "recycled water" [...] or [...] "reclaimed water" [...] typically mean wastewater sent {{from a home}} or business through a sewer system to a wastewater treatment plant, where it is treated to a level consistent with its intended use.|$|E
2500|$|Scientists {{generally}} {{define the}} five components of earth's climate system to include atmosphere, <b>hydrosphere,</b> cryosphere, lithosphere (restricted {{to the surface}} soils, rocks, and sediments), and biosphere. [...] Natural changes in the climate system ("internal forcings") result in internal [...] "climate variability". [...] Examples include the type and distribution of species, and changes in ocean-atmosphere circulations.|$|E
