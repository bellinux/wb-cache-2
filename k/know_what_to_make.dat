5|$|The nation {{initially}} did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of Coolidge, who {{had maintained}} {{a low profile}} in the Harding administration; many had even {{expected him to be}} replaced on the ballot in 1924. Coolidge believed that those of Harding's men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence, taking a methodical approach to the scandals, principally the Teapot Dome scandal, while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty. Coolidge thought the Senate investigations of the scandals would suffice; this was affirmed by the resulting resignations of those involved. He personally intervened in demanding the resignation of Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty after he refused to cooperate with the congressional probe. He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration, arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing. Harry A. Slattery reviewed the facts with him, Harlan F. Stone analyzed the legal aspects for him and Senator William E. Borah assessed and presented the political factors.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Coulter takes Lyra {{into her}} home, {{in a big}} city that resembles a retrofuturistic London, and starts taking her to socialite dinners and parties. In her bedroom, Lyra gazes upon the alethiometer and notices that it {{continuously}} points to a lady, a lightning bolt, and a baby. She does not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of her observation, however, and says nothing of it to Mrs.Coulter. Despite initially projecting the image of a free-spirited woman, she reveals herself to be extremely respectful of the Magisterium and its function. One night, Lyra casually mentions Dust; this puts Mrs. Coulter on edge as she warns Lyra never to mention it again, and also insists that she stop carrying around the bag secretly containing the aleithiometer. Mrs.Coulter's dæmon (a golden monkey) attacks Pantalaimon, causing Lyra to give in. Lyra and Pantalaimon discover that Mrs.Coulter is head of the General Oblation Board, also known as the “Gobblers”, who have been kidnapping local children. Lyra also learns that her best friend Roger and her Gyptian friend Billy have been both taken by the Gobblers.|$|E
500|$|The Great Galilean was {{not well}} received. The New York Times {{reviewer}} called it hopelessly muddled, finding Keable's claims about the unknowability of Jesus contrary to his efforts to understand and worship him: [...] "Frankly, we do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of it. We can only suppose that street preaching at Cambridge, and even climbing Kilimanjaro, are not conducive to logic." ...|$|E

500|$|Among initial {{reviews of}} the single, the NMEs Derek Johnson confessed to being both fascinated and {{confused}} by [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", writing: [...] "Certainly the most unusual and way-out single The Beatles have yet produced – both in lyrical content and scoring. Quite honestly, I don't really <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of it." [...] Time magazine hailed the song as [...] "the latest sample of the Beatles' astonishing inventiveness".|$|E
500|$|Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, {{published}} together posthumously in December 1817, {{were reviewed}} in the British Critic in March 1818 {{and in the}} Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany in May 1818. The reviewer for the British Critic felt that Austen's exclusive dependence on realism was evidence of a deficient imagination. The reviewer for the Edinburgh Review disagreed, praising Austen for her [...] "exhaustless invention" [...] and {{the combination of the}} familiar and the surprising in her plots. Overall, Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of her novels—for example, they misunderstood her use of irony. Reviewers reduced Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice to didactic tales of virtue prevailing over vice.|$|E
500|$|At the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign {{she belonged}} to Kappa Kappa Gamma {{sorority}} where she befriended a beautiful older sorority sister, [...] "the prettiest I had ever seen", quite popular {{with men and}} with women. Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} it happening and I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of it. I don't even know how to put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." [...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not to stare at her. In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E

500|$|Debut {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest albums of 1993 and the 1990s in general. In 2013, John Hamilton of Idolator called the album [...] "highly influential", and wrote [...] "in spite of its advancing age, Debuts futurism has aged exquisitely." [...] The album has also been credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic music into mainstream pop. Stereogum's Tom Breihan wrote: [...] "House music didn't quite have critical respect before Björk came along, and plenty of American writers didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of the sound of Debut when it came out. [...] Debut didn't just establish Björk; it helped make sounds like that cool to a segment of the music-dork universe that might've remained deaf to its charms otherwise. At this point, it's virtually impossible to imagine a big publication slamming an adventurous dance-pop album for [...] "cheap electronic gimmickry," [...] and Debut is a big part of that change." [...] Celebrating the album's twenty-year anniversary, Emily Mackay of NME wrote the album [...] "put the lie to the post-grunge assumption that heartfelt, passionate solo artistry came in the form of acoustic guitar and heartbreak, creating a new breed of singer-songwriter." [...] Dubbing it an [...] "influential masterpiece", she found influences of the album in the work of musicians such as M.I.A., Grimes, These New Puritans and Tune-Yards, writing: [...] "It's in fascinatingly individual artists like those that you'll find [...] influence — not, as many would have you believe, in every pretty-faced girl with a big voice." [...] Mackay also noted that the album's legacy echoes through dance-pop artists like Lady Gaga and Robyn.|$|E
500|$|Animation {{can provide}} wide open vistas for stories; the French film Fantastic Planet (1972) {{explored}} ideas {{beyond the limits}} of traditional, live-action science fiction films. [...] Phil Hoad of The Guardian identifies Akira (1988) as introducing violent, adult Japanese animation (known as anime) to the West and paving the way for later works. [...] Anime, according to academic Brian Ruh, is not a cult genre, but the lack of individual fandoms inside anime fandom itself lends itself to a bleeding over of cult attention and can help spread works internationally. [...] Anime, which is often highly franchised, provides its fans with alternative fictional canons and points of view that can drive fan activity. [...] The Ghost in the Shell franchise, for example, provided Japanese fans with enough bonus material and spinoffs that it encouraged cult tendencies. [...] Markets that did not support the sale of these materials saw less cult activity. Ralph Bakshi's career has been marked with controversy: Fritz the Cat (1972), the first animated film to be rated [...] "X" [...] by the MPAA, provoked outrage for its racial caricatures and graphic depictions of sex, and Coonskin (1975) was decried as racist. [...] Bakshi recalls that older animators had tired of [...] "kid stuff" [...] and desired edgier work, whereas younger animators hated his work for [...] "destroying the Disney images". [...] Eventually, his work would be reassessed and cult followings, which include Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, developed around several of his films. [...] Heavy Metal (1981) faced similar denunciations from critics; Donald Liebenson of the Los Angeles Times cites the violence and sexual imagery as alienating critics, who did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of the film. [...] It would go on to become a popular midnight movie and frequently bootlegged by fans, as licensing issues kept it from being released on video for many years.|$|E
500|$|By early 1955, Presley's regular Hayride appearances, {{constant}} touring, and well-received record releases {{had made}} him a regional star, from Tennessee to West Texas. In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought the singer {{to the attention of}} Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Having successfully managed top country star Eddy Arnold, Parker was now working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow. Parker booked Presley on Snow's February tour. When the tour reached Odessa, Texas, a 19-year-old Roy Orbison saw Presley for the first time: [...] "His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing.... I just didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of it. There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it." [...] Presley made his television debut on March 3 on the KSLA-TV broadcast of Louisiana Hayride. Soon after, he failed an audition for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts on the CBS television network. By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to [...] "Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill"; on the latest recordings, the trio were joined by a drummer. Some of the songs, like [...] "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the [...] "R idiom of negro field jazz"; others, like [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were [...] "more in the country field", [...] "but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both". This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because he sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rhythm-and-blues stations would touch him because [...] "he sounded too much like a hillbilly." [...] The blend {{came to be known as}} rockabilly. At the time, Presley was variously billed as [...] "The King of Western Bop", [...] "The Hillbilly Cat", and [...] "The Memphis Flash".|$|E
60|$|This {{was coming}} {{so much to}} the point that the deacon hardly <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of it. He recollected his own ten dollars, and the covetousness of his {{disposition}} so far got the better of his prudence as to induce him to mention the circumstance.|$|R

2500|$|A lifelong fan of {{film critic}} Pauline Kael, Anderson {{arranged}} a private screening of Rushmore for the retired writer. Afterwards, she told him, [...] "I genuinely don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of this movie". It was a nerve-wracking experience for Anderson but Kael did like {{the film and}} told others to see it. Anderson and Jason Schwartzman traveled from Los Angeles to New York City and back on a touring bus to promote the film. The tour started on January 21, 1999 and went through 11 cities in the United States.|$|E
60|$|I scarce <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of this girl; {{there was}} so much of gayety, and even fun, blended with a mine of as deep feeling as I ever saw {{throwing}} up its signs to the human countenance.

60|$|Madeline and Helen, {{assisted}} by Castleton, worked over Dorothy, {{and with some}} difficulty quieted her.

2500|$|In 1953 {{at the age}} of 13 Janis Martin was {{developing}} her own proto-rockabilly style on WRVA's Old Dominion Barn Dance, which broadcast out of Richmond, VA. Although Martin performed mostly country songs for the show, she also did songs by Rhythm and blues singers Ruth Brown and LaVern Baker, as well as a few Dinah Washington songs. [...] "The audience didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of it.

2500|$|New York {{magazine}} contributor Amanda Dobbins {{noted the}} music video [...] "predictably [...] garnered some attention" [...] from the public. Rya Backer of MTV questioned Del Rey's originality, saying, [...] "it's hard to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of Lana Del Rey at first glance. Is she as Jools Holland once dubbed her an 'Internet phenomenon' worth {{no more than}} a few salacious blog posts? Or is she a legitimate chanteuse wrapped in the hyper feminine, yet innately American (and admittedly well-curated) image she's projected in videos for such tracks as 'Video Games' and 'Blue Jeans'?" [...] Pitchforks Ian Cohen commented that the music video [...] "fits between surrendering to romance and depression, moving with the elegant wastefulness of the kind of day drunk that's a true privilege of the beautiful, idle class." ...|$|E

However, many of the accounts are contradictory in nature and some do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of Erauso's predicament.

5000|$|In 2002 Remo {{released}} two albums which, once again, {{were very}} much ahead of their time for India. The music was contemplative, orchestral, complex. The album were [...] "India Beyond" [...] and [...] "Symphonic Chants". Tracks from [...] "India Beyond" [...] were signed to and released by Buddha Bar, Paris, France, and Opium Garden, Miami, USA.

2500|$|Listed as a 6'5" [...] forward/center in 2000, Turner was a 26-year-old rookie with Dungannon. At first, Turner didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of Ireland. He {{was struck}} by the locals' {{hospitality}} and intrigued by the country's history, but he was initially unimpressed by the amenities and customs. Turner explained, [...] "I was still on my spoiled American high horse. 'The locker rooms are too small. I’ve got to carry my own bag. We don't practise enough. They want me to coach the local kids when I just want to play.' But when I went back to America for the Christmas break, I realised that I had to take my blinders off or I'd end up just like my friends at home, doing nothing or working in a job they hated." [...] He came to embrace the lifestyle and it showed on and off the court. However, while he was considered 'prolific' and made a significant contribution every game, he often lacked support in offensive situations. In a 92–74 loss to Tralee Tigers in January 2001, Turner had a 49-point effort.|$|E

"Over 131 years, 404 {{men have}} been accorded to the honour of wearing the baggy green cap, arguably the most {{significant}} and recognizable symbol in Australian team sport," [...] wrote Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) Glenn Mitchell. [...] "Many today would have hung their head in sadness while others would have turned and in their grave. What happened today in Nagpur was at odds with team sport is all about. May it never be allowed to happen again." [...] The barrage of Ponting's decision continued, with then Australian leading Test run-scorer (since overtaken by Ponting) saying on Fox Sports, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of this. They go into the tea break on a high and come out worrying about over-rates. I am glad Ricky can't read my mind right now {{because he is not}} going to like it." [...] Ponting later admitted that Border's comment was the one that hurt him the most, despite News Limited reporter Jon Pierik describing his captaincy as a [...] "joke", while Malcolm Conn from The Australian wrote it was his [...] "worst day as national captain". Indian newspapers also continued with the criticism, with some suggesting Ponting put himself before the team. Ponting angrily responded to such comments at the post-Test media conference.|$|E
