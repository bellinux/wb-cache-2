500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Upgrade U" [...] was shot during the two-week filming for the B'Day Anthology Video Album. It was {{directed}} by Melina and Knowles herself. The video was shot between those of [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] and [...] "Green Light", and took about one and half days of filming. Jay-Z performed his rap scenes first, [...] afterwards Knowles studied his scene, and then did her impersonation of him. Melina said: [...] "If anybody knows Jay-Z, it would be Beyoncé". Knowles commented on her impersonation of Jay-Z on MTV, [...] "I love what I did in [...] because it's completely out of my character, {{or at least the}} character that people think I am. I was pretending to be Jay, and he was there, and I told him he had to leave, because I couldn't do it with him in the room — it was way too embarrassing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a pretty good job. I had the lip curl down!" [...] The video premiered on February 28, 2007, on BET's 106 & Park, with the video for Knowles' other single release, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] (2007) featuring Shakira, premiering the same day on Total Request Live (TRL).|$|E

6000|$|... "You see <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{that because}} he might have jumped off if I hadn't been up there to prevent him--I mean if we had had a smash. I didn't {{want him to get}} out of it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Love you?" [...] said I, then I sighed, {{and then}} I gazed upon her sweetly-- For <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{this sort of}} thing {{particularly}} neatly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} speak as <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{agree that it}} would be inexpedient. She would to a certain extent lose the countenance of her friends--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Such {{stories are}} not very quickly told; {{and in this case}} it was {{necessary}} to understand him very accurately. At length <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> understand him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite fair, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not come}} clandestinely. I am {{not ashamed of}} what I am doing,--or of what I am going to do. I may be ashamed of this,--that I should feel my chance of success to be so small. When I was here before I asked you to--allow me to love you. I now ask you again." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not betray myself. The {{old woman}} was {{watching}} me as a cat does a mouse; she had her right hand hidden {{in the folds of}} her gown, clutching, I knew, that long, cruel-looking dagger. Had she seen any disappointment in my face she would, I felt, have known that the moment had come, and would have sprung on me like a tigress, certain of taking me unprepared.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} as well as you do," [...] I said, coolly. [...] "But a man must have a name of some sort. I can assure you that I do not extravagantly admire the name of Pinkhammer. But when one christens one's self suddenly, the fine names do not seem to suggest themselves.

60|$|She was insensible, and I {{was afraid}} to have her moved, or even touched. Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if I {{unreasonably}} fancied (<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did)</b> that, if I let her go, the fire would break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeon's coming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my hands were burnt; for, I {{had no knowledge of}} it through the sense of feeling.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Todd almost whistled {{before she}} gave her answer. [...] "Why, Miss Mackenzie, that's where they dance and play cards, and where the girls flirt and the young men make fools of themselves. I don't go there very often myself, because I don't care about flirting, and I'm too old for dancing. As for cards, I get plenty of them at home. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> put down my name and paid {{something}} when I first came here, but that's ever so many years ago. I don't go to the assembly rooms now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At noon we {{went home}} for dinner and then back again for history in the afternoon. The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully mixed up in the dates. Still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> fairly well today. But oh, Diana, {{tomorrow}} the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it it takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my Euclid. If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would recite it from now till tomorrow morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir John, you mistake me, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{desire that}} you avenge me. I have asked you upon what grounds {{you intend to}} do this thing, and you have not {{answered}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I daresay not; I daresay not. Men who {{begin as}} late as you did never know what {{official}} life really means. Now I've been at it all my life, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> understand it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are clever, Carrie. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> mean {{something}} like that. I feel {{now and then}} {{as if there was}} another Jim Dearham who, so to speak, hadn't developed yet. In a way, I'm afraid of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was sufficient. All {{that the}} world could give seemed {{comprised}} within the brief sentence; and {{it was difficult to}} remember that we stood clear {{in the eyes of the}} swarming toilers upon the level prairie. Neither do I remember what either of us next said, for there was a glamour upon me; but as we turned back towards Haldane, side by side, I hazarded a query, and Lucille smiled. [...] "You ask too many questions--are you not yet content? Still, since you ask, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand aright either until a little while ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I {{dare say}} his bones are sore. I know mine are. But I don't care {{for that in}} the least. When this day comes to be talked about, as I dare {{say it will be}} for many a long year, no one will {{be able to say that}} the Hitchiners got into that covert." [...] Thoroughbung, with the genuine modesty of an Englishman, would not say that he had {{achieved}} by his own prowess all this glory for the Puckeridge Hunt, but he felt it down to the very end of his nails.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not have}} to wait ten seconds after her departure, for a stable-man had seen us {{approach}} and immediately came forward. I jumped down from the cart and looked {{in the direction of}} the road. I thought if I were to make a cross-cut over the lawn and some adjacent fields I should get back to my bear much quicker than if I returned the way I had come. But this thought had scarcely shaped itself in my mind when I heard the approach of hurrying feet, and in the next moment a little army had thrown itself upon me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rich or not, I never thought; but {{it looks}} so happy, I can't tell how; and it is so far away. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> but dream it is there. You should see it in a sunset." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Isabel I {{wanted to}} see. Didn't I leave a card? No; <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> felt so--almost at home, that <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> of a card." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> want to," [...] she replied. [...] "You are so kind, so good, and {{you have}} confided in me. Yes, I was once discarded, not exactly by word of mouth, or even by message, but still discarded." ...|$|R
