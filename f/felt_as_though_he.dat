5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Soeman {{was made a}} school supervisor by occupying forces. He soon became involved in politics, being elected to the Shūsangikai, a Japanese-sponsored regional representatives' council, for Riau. He later recalled that, {{because he had been}} elected rather than selected by the Japanese forces—and thus had strong backing among the community, which could be used for revolution—he had <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> was under constant surveillance. This situation continued until after the Japanese withdrew from Indonesia and Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{nominations}} {{began the}} following day. Hardin <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> had been cheated and withdrew his candidacy, although some loyal delegates continued {{to vote for}} him. Delegate John Stockdale Rhea nominated Stone. Stone believed that his agreement with Goebel meant, with Hardin's withdrawal, Goebel would instruct his delegates to vote for Stone, maintaining a unified party. That understanding vanished when another delegate nominated Goebel. Stone was further incensed {{when all of the}} Louisville delegation voted for Goebel instead of being split between Stone and Goebel, as the two men had previously agreed. In retaliation, some Stone supporters began to back Hardin. Seeing the breakdown of the Stone-Goebel alliance, Hardin reversed his withdrawal. After numerous ballots, the convention was deadlocked on the night of June 24 with each candidate receiving about one-third of the votes. No deliberations were held on Sunday, June 25, and when the delegates reconvened on Monday, June 26, the hall was filled with police per Redwine's request. Rhea requested that the police be removed to prevent intimidation, but Redwine ruled the motion out of order. Another delegate appealed Redwine's decision, and, in violation of parliamentary rule, Redwine ruled the appeal out of order. Angered by Redwine's obviously biased rulings, delegates for Stone and Hardin then began trying to disrupt the convention by blowing horns, singing, yelling, and standing on chairs. Although voting was attempted, many delegates abstained because they were unable to hear and understand what was going on. When the voting—such as it was—ended, the chair announced that Goebel had a majority of the votes cast, but Goebel sent word to Redwine that he would only accept the nomination if he received an absolute majority of the delegates. Further attempts to vote were likewise disrupted, and the meeting adjourned for the day.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein's {{influence}} has been felt {{in nearly every}} field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are diverging interpretations of his thought. In the words of his friend and colleague Georg Henrik von Wright: He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.|$|E

500|$|The {{first two}} songs Åkerfeldt wrote for Heritage {{were in the}} style of Watershed. After hearing the songs for the first time, Martín Méndez told Åkerfeldt that he would be {{disappointed}} if the album continued in that direction. Relieved that Méndez was not interested in doing another conventional Opeth album, Åkerfeldt scrapped the two songs and started the writing process over in a different style. In the press release for Heritage, Mikael Åkerfeldt revealed that he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> had been building to write the album since he was 19 years old. In a review for Allmusic, Thom Jurek called Heritage the band's most adventurous album, describing the songs as [...] "drenched in instrumental interludes, knotty key and chord changes, shifting time signatures, clean vocals, and a keyboard-heavy instrumentation that includes Mellotrons, Rhodes pianos, and Hammond organs".|$|E
500|$|Wullschlager {{observes that}} in [...] "The Princess and the Pea" [...] Andersen blended his {{childhood}} {{memories of a}} primitive world of violence, death, and inexorable fate, with his social climber's private romance about the serene, secure and cultivated Danish bourgeoisie, which did not quite accept {{him as one of}} their own. Researcher Jack Zipes said that Andersen, during his lifetime, [...] "was obliged to act as a dominated subject within the dominant social circles despite his fame and recognition as a writer"; Andersen therefore developed a feared and loved view of the aristocracy. Others have said that Andersen constantly <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> did not belong, and longed {{to be a part of}} the upper class. The nervousness and humiliations Andersen suffered in the presence of the bourgeoisie were mythologized by the storyteller in the tale of [...] "The Princess and the Pea", with Andersen himself the morbidly sensitive princess who can feel a pea through 20mattresses.|$|E
500|$|The {{marriage}} {{was in the}} process of breaking down rapidly. Northrup and Hubbard had frequent rows and his violent behaviour towards her continued unabated. On one occasion, while Northrup was pregnant, Hubbard kicked her several times in the stomach in an apparent – though unsuccessful – attempt to induce an abortion. She recalled that [...] "with or without an argument, there'd be an upsurge of violence. The veins in his forehead would engorge" [...] and he would hit her [...] "out of the blue", breaking her eardrum in one attack. Despite this, she still [...] "felt so guilty about the fact that he was so psychologically damaged. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> had given so much to our country and I couldn't even bring him peace of mind. I believed thoroughly that he was a man of great honor, had sacrificed his well being to the country ... It just never occurred to me he was a liar." [...] He told her that he didn't want to be married [...] "for I can buy my friends whenever I want them" [...] but he could not divorce either, as the stigma would hurt his reputation. Instead, he said, if Northrup really loved him she should kill herself.|$|E
60|$|He {{was willing}} enough to wait, perhaps, but time was inexorable. Save for one hurried interview, I {{did not see}} him again for a week, {{and then it was}} before the altar. His {{garrulity}} had fallen from him like a garment. He was preoccupied and a trifle bashful. He fumbled with the ring. I <b>felt</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> was my younger brother.|$|R
60|$|He sat on {{the veranda}} with a closed book on his knee, and, as it were, looked out upon his solitude, as if the fact of Captain Whalley's {{blindness}} had opened his eyes to his own. There were many sorts of heartaches and troubles, {{and there was no}} place where they could not find a man out. And <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> ashamed, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> had for six years behaved like a peevish boy.|$|R
6000|$|Then at {{the first}} Sir Percival stood very still at the door-way <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> had of a sudden been turned into stone. Then he went forward and stood beside the couch and held his hands very tightly {{together}} and gazed at the Lady Yvette where she lay. So he stood for a long while, and he wist not why it was that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> {{had been turned into}} a stone, without such grief at his heart as he had thought to feel thereat. (For indeed, his spirit was altogether broken <b>though</b> <b>he</b> knew it not.) ...|$|R
500|$|Stylistically, One Hot Minute diverged {{from the}} Chili Peppers' {{previous}} records—especially Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The album {{was characterized by}} prominent use of heavy metal guitar riffs and hints of psychedelic rock. Navarro, unlike Flea and Kiedis, was not influenced by funk music. He told Guitar World in 1996, [...] "It doesn't really speak to me. But then again, when I'm playing with three other guys who I love and feel camaraderie with, it's enjoyable to play funk." [...] Navarro's own style was influenced mainly by classic rock guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page, as well as gothic rock guitarists Robert Smith and Daniel Ash. Continuing a trend that started on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Kiedis diverged even further away from his signature rapping, only doing so on a few tracks. One Hot Minute took almost two years to write, and its recording and production was not a smooth process. Navarro <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> was an outsider to the other members. His writing in Jane's Addiction was independent from other contributors, whereas the Red Hot Chili Peppers was a far more collaborative group. Navarro himself noted that the band's dynamic was more balanced than that of Jane's Addiction, which was often dominated by frontman Perry Farrell.|$|E
500|$|... "Never Had a Dream Come True" [...] {{had marked}} a more mature {{direction}} for the group whilst still retaining their pop sensibilities, a direction which continued into their third studio album, Sunshine. The album contained {{what was to become}} one of S Club's most popular tracks, [...] "Don't Stop Movin'". The song was released in April 2001, marked a high point for the group as the single went straight to number-one, went Platinum and became the seventh best selling single of 2001. McIntosh, who takes lead vocals with O'Meara in the track, said he was [...] "nervous" [...] about taking lead vocals and was worried how people would react. However, after the song went in at number-one, he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "supported by the fans" [...] and his fears were alleviated. McIntosh also remarked that the single had broken new ground for the group, and Cattermole thought it to be their [...] "best song by miles". The group won the Record of the Year award for the song, and in February 2002, the single won the group their second BRIT Award for best British single. The song has since been covered by The Beautiful South for their 2004 album Golddiggas, Headnodders and Pholk Songs, as well as by Starsailor who recorded it for BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.|$|E

60|$|Sterne's {{discovery}} was made. It was repugnant to his imagination, shocking to his ideas of honesty, shocking to {{his conception of}} mankind. This enormity affected one's outlook on what was possible in this world: {{it was as if}} for instance the sun had turned blue, throwing a new and sinister light on men and nature. Really in the first moment <b>he</b> had <b>felt</b> sickish, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> had got a blow below the belt: for a second the very color of the sea seemed changed--appeared queer to his wandering eye; and he had a passing, unsteady sensation in all his limbs <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the earth had started turning the other way.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{preferred}} {{to make love}} here--under my very nose," [...] he said, furiously.

She rose, and with {{her hand on the}} back of the chair confronted him with eyes that were perfectly dry now. There was a red spot on each of her cheeks.|$|R
50|$|On August 14, Gladys {{died from}} Cirrhosis. The {{official}} {{cause of death}} was listed as heart attack, but the Presleys refused an autopsy to verify it. Presley and Vernon were both devastated by her death. Her funeral was held on August 15, and Presley collapsed several times before, during, and after the service. His mother had always been {{the most important person in}} his life, and now <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> everything <b>he</b> had worked for had been for nothing.

60|$|He walked {{about the}} room, again trying to think. Or, perhaps, all {{thinking}} was over with him now, {{and he was}} resolving {{in his own mind}} how best he might begin to yield. He must obey his daughter. He could not break the heart of the only child that was left to him. He had no delight in the world other than what came to him reflected back from her. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> now <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> was simply a steward endeavouring on her behalf to manage things to the best advantage; but still only a steward, and as such only a servant who could not at last decide on the mode of management to be adopted. He could endeavour to persuade, but she must decide. Now his daughter had decided, and he must begin this task, so utterly distasteful to him, of endeavouring to wash the blackamoor white.|$|R
60|$|If Oliver Trembath <b>felt,</b> while descending, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> {{should never}} reach the bottom, he felt far more powerfully as if {{reaching}} the top were {{an event of}} the distant future--all the more that the muscles of his arms and legs, unused to the peculiar process, were beginning to feel rather stiff. This feeling, however, soon passed away, and {{when he began to}} grow warm to the work, his strength seemed to return and to increase with each step--a species of revival of vigour in the midst of hard toil with which probably all strong men are acquainted.|$|R
60|$|Brett Street was {{not very}} far away. It {{branched}} off, narrow, {{from the side of}} an open triangular space surrounded by dark and mysterious houses, temples of petty commerce emptied of traders for the night. Only a fruiterer’s stall at the corner made a violent blaze of light and colour. Beyond all was black, and the few people passing in that direction vanished at one stride beyond the glowing heaps of oranges and lemons. No footsteps echoed. They would never be heard of again. The adventurous head of the Special Crimes Department watched these disappearances from a distance with an interested eye. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> light-hearted, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> had been ambushed all alone in a jungle many thousands of miles away from departmental desks and official inkstands. This joyousness and dispersion of thought before a task of some importance seems to prove that this world of ours is not such a very serious affair after all.

2500|$|Earnhardt had German ancestry. He {{was born}} on April 29, 1951, in Kannapolis, North Carolina, as the third child of Martha (Coleman) and Ralph Earnhardt.

Although Ralph did not want his son to pursue a career as a race car driver, Dale dropped out of school to pursue his dreams.

2500|$|Indian {{diplomacy}} occupied much of Clark's time; the dutiful {{soldier and}} bureaucrat never wavered in {{his commitment to}} an expansionist national agenda that expected Indians to surrender their lands, abandon their traditional ways, and acquiesce {{to the dictates of}} the U.S. government. But he was aware of the consequences and he demonstrated genuine concern for the plight of destitute native people increasingly threatened with extinction. Clark's expeditions and frontier settlement gave him unique views and feelings toward Native Americans. He <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> held a firm hand when he had to, {{but at the same time}} he had passion towards them as people still deserving of rights.

[...] Clark took his position as one of extreme importance to not only the government of the United States, but to the Native American people as well.|$|E
6000|$|He quite took to Mrs. Walshingham. He was {{impressed}} by her conspicuous tact and refinement; {{it seemed to him}} that the ladylike could go no further. She was always dressed with a delicate fussiness that was never disarranged and even a sort of faded quality about her hair and face and bearing and emotions contributed to her effect. Kipps was not a big man, and commonly he did not feel a big man, but with Mrs. Walshingham he always felt enormous and distended, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> was a navvy who had taken some disagreeable poison which puffed him up inside his skin as a preliminary to bursting. <b>He</b> <b>felt,</b> too, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> had been rolled in clay and his hair dressed with gum. And he felt that his voice was strident and his accent like somebody swinging a crowded pig's pail in a free and careless manner. All this increased and enforced his respect for her. Her hand, which flitted often and again to his hand and arm, was singularly well shaped and cool. [...] "Arthur," [...] she called him from the very beginning.|$|R
60|$|He went in {{and ordered}} the dinner; filled the spirit decanters, opened a couple of bottles of wine, and then walked out again. In giving his orders, and doing the various little things with which {{he had to keep}} himself employed, everybody, and {{everything}} seemed strange to him. He hardly knew what he was about, and <b>felt</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> were in a dream. He had quite made up his mind as to what he would do; his resolution was fixed to carry it through but:--still there was the but,--how was he to open it to Doctor Colligan? He walked up and down the gravel path for a long time, thinking of this; or rather trying to think of it, for his thoughts would fly away to all manner of other subjects, and he continually found himself harping upon some trifle, connected with Anty, but wholly irrespective of her death; some little thing that she had done for him, or ought to have done; something she had said a long time ago, and which he had never thought of till now; something she had worn, and which at the time he did not even know that he had observed; and as often as he found his mind thus wandering, he would start off at a quicker pace, and again endeavour to lay out a line of conduct for the evening.|$|R
60|$|The city made a {{spectacle}} from above. On all sides superb paper carp floated to the breeze, {{tugging at the}} strings that held them to the poles quite after {{the manner of the}} real fish. One <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though,</b> by accident, <b>he</b> had stepped into some mammoth globe of goldfish. The whole sky was alive with them. Eighty square miles of finny folk inside the city, and an untold company without. The counterfeit presentments were from five to ten feet long, and painted to mimic life. The breeze entered at the mouth and passed out somewhat less freely at the tail, thus keeping them well bellied and constantly in motion. The way they rose and dove and turned and wriggled was worthy of free will. Indeed, they had every look of spontaneity, and lacked only the thing itself to turn the sky into an ocean, and Tokyo into a sea bottom with a rockery of roof. Each fish commemorates the birth of a boy during the year. It would thus be possible to take a census of the increase of the male population yearly, at the trifling cost of scaling a housetop,--a set of statistics not without an eventual value.|$|R
2500|$|Haggard {{describes}} {{feeling the}} call of God on his life after {{his first year in}} college, {{while he was in the}} kitchen at home. He had been a telecommunications major with a minor in journalism, but after this experience he believed he had been called to pastor. [...] "I was totally surprised," [...] Haggard wrote in The Life-Giving Church. [...] "I [...] [...] [...] told the Lord I wanted to serve Him. But before I mentioned this to anyone, especially to my parents, I asked the Lord to assure me by using others to confirm His calling on my life. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>He</b> consented [...] [...] [...]" [...] Within forty-eight hours, Haggard felt that he received four unsolicited confirmations: from a Sunday school teacher, a pastor, a friend, and from his father. Haggard subsequently attended Oral Roberts University, a Christian university in Tulsa, Oklahoma, graduating in 1978.|$|E
2500|$|Brazelton began {{introducing}} more recurring {{characters in}} the strip's third year (Jimmy & Charlie) {{in an effort to}} emulate Jeph Jacques' success with Questionable Content. [...] The two introductory storylines featuring the new characters were popular with Brazelton's audience [...] "because they showed a dimension to the characters that made the audience invest in them as creations. They weren't simply avatars for my out-there opinions about films and demonstrated I could stretch beyond gag-a-day joke writing." [...] He backed away from converting the theme of the entire strip when some alienated fans complained, and Brazelton <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>he</b> were abandoning his roots. [...] COMIXtalk's Xaviar Xerexes described Theater Hopper as straddling the fence between two other popular film-based webcomics, Joe Loves Crappy Movies (a movie review in comic form), and Multiplex (a serialized, character-driven story); Xerexes likened Theater Hopper more to Penny Arcade or VG Cats as opposed to PvP or Questionable Content.|$|E

I was able to counterpunch and made Gennady wobble at least three times. If we fight again, it's up to the people. I feel frustrated over my draw." [...] Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez believed judge Byrd had her scorecard filled out before the first bell rang. Álvarez ruled out another fight in 2017, claiming he would return on Cinco de Mayo weekend in May 2018. At the post-fight press conference, Álvarez said through a translator, “Look, right now I wanna rest. Whatever the fans want, whatever the people want and ask for, we’ll do. You know that’s my style. But right now, who knows if it’s in May or September? But one thing’s for sure – this is my era, the era of Canelo.” Golovkin's promoter Tom Loeffler stated that they would like an immediate rematch, but Golovkin, who prefers fighting at least three times in a calendar year, reiterated his desire to also fight in December.|$|E
