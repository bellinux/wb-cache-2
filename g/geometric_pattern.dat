5|$|Most solids {{used are}} {{engineering}} materials consisting of crystalline solids {{in which the}} atoms or ions are arranged in a repetitive <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern</b> which {{is known as a}} lattice structure. The only exception is material that is made from glass which is a combination of a supercooled liquid and polymers which are aggregates of large organic molecules.|$|E
5|$|Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. They were designed with flat roofs to enable additional storeys to be constructed for commercial occupants, maximising the air rights of the property. Except for Embankment, which had a sloping passageway down to the platforms, each station was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern</b> and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} work I {{try to explain}} {{the ways in which}} I {{attempted}} to combine mathematics and visual arts by utilizing Islamic <b>geometric</b> <b>patterns.</b> The thesis starts with the reasons why I chose to work with Islamic <b>geometric</b> <b>patterns.</b> It continues with a chapter about the mathematical aspects of Islamic <b>geometric</b> <b>patterns</b> in order to give the reader a technical view on Islamic <b>geometric</b> <b>patterns.</b> In the following chapter, I explain my first two projects at C:Art:Media, Trifinity and Earthly. Afterwards I discuss in detail my degree project Iduk. Finally, the thesis ends with a conclusion about my utilization of Islamic <b>geometric</b> <b>patterns</b> in my attempt to combine mathematics and visual arts. My primary reasons for working with Islamic <b>geometric</b> <b>patterns</b> are two-fold. First, they include both mathematical and artistic aspects, and second, they contain a vast amount of symbolism that I can utilize for my projects. During my projects the symbolic aspect of my works has changed; the symbolic language in my projects evolved form an abstract and ancient language of symbols to a language of more dynamic, current and mundane symbols. To utilize Islamic <b>geometric</b> <b>patterns</b> in my investigation on how to combine mathematics and visual arts, my methodology was to use these patterns in my projects. In each of my projects, I used Islami...|$|R

5|$|The {{interior}} {{walls of the}} throne hall are painted with a lotus bud design arranged in a <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern.</b> Within the lotus buds are seated praying deities, a common Thai motif often associated with holy places. The ceiling, which has a coffered octagonal shape section directly below the spire, is decorated with glass mosaic stars. This reinforces the impression {{of being in a}} heavenly abode. The interior panel of the door and window shutters depicted standing deities facing each other holding weapons as guards for the king. The thickness of the walls allow further spaces between the shutters and the wall to be decorated, these are decorated with murals depicting trees in Chinese style.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} {{adopted by the}} earlier tube lines, each of the UERL's lines was {{constructed}} {{as a pair of}} circular tunnels using tunnelling shields with segmental cast iron tunnel linings bolted together and grouted into place as the shield advanced. Generally the tunnels followed surface roads and were constructed side by side, but where the width of the road above was insufficient, tunnels were placed one above the other. Stations on all three lines were provided with surface buildings designed by the UERL's architect Leslie Green in a standardised style modified for each site. These consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The stations had flat roofs and were designed to accommodate upward extension for commercial development. Most stations were provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern</b> and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E

25|$|The {{colour pattern}} {{is a complex}} <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern</b> that {{incorporates}} different colours. The back typically has a series of irregular diamond shapes flanked by smaller markings with light centers. In this species' wide geographic range, much variation of size, colour, and markings commonly occurs.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} has {{two sets}} of pews divided by a broad center aisle. A serpentine balcony supported by iron columns covers the northern third, with a glazed screen creating a narthex. At the south end, a pulpit and lectern front a dais with Communion {{table in front of}} a dossal curtain is set in a crenellated Tudor Gothic wooden surround between {{two sets of}} organ pipes. On either side are the choir risers. The stained glass windows are set in a <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern,</b> each one having a diagonal stripe suggesting heraldric origin, with a floral design in yellow or pink at the top.|$|E

Its ceiling is painted with Aurora trazendo a Felicidade Pública, Abundância, Mentira and Justiça (by Cyrilio and Taborda), while the mouldings feature military motifs. On {{side of the room}} is an Italian black marble fireplace/stove, comprising two ionic columns, supporting a frieze ornamented by flowers and cornice, with fire-guard in metal. The parquet floor is formed into a <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern</b> and the space decorated with several gold-velvet chairs, large vases, lowboy furniture and red-velvet topped table.|$|E

25|$|According to Reza Assasi, the {{swastika}} is a <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern</b> {{in the sky}} {{representing the}} north ecliptic pole centred to Zeta Draconis. He argues that this primitive astrological symbol was later called the four-horse chariot of Mithra in ancient Iran and represented the centre of Ecliptic in the star map and also demonstrates that in Iranian mythology, the cosmos {{was believed to be}} pulled by four heavenly horses revolving around a fixed centre on clockwise direction possibly because of a geocentric understanding of an astronomical phenomenon called axial precession. He suggests that this notion was transmitted to the west and flourished in Roman mithraism in which this symbol appears in Mithraic iconography and astrological representations.|$|E
25|$|L. geometricus is {{slightly}} smaller and generally lighter in color than the black widow species; the color {{can range from}} tan to dark brown to black, with shades of grey also possible. Like the black widow species in the United States, L. geometricus has a prominent hourglass-shaped marking {{on the underside of}} the abdomen; the brown widow's hourglass, however, is usually a vivid orange or a yellowish color. Unlike the black widow, L. geometricus has a black-and-white <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern</b> on the dorsal side of its abdomen. Although the Latin name comes from this pattern, a spider's coloring can and does darken over time and the pattern may become obscured. Also, they have stripes on their legs. Brown widows are often preyed on by mud daubers and sometimes by digger wasps.|$|E

The image, [...] tall, has 18 arms in a form that expresses the dance {{positions}} arranged in a <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern,</b> which Alice Bonera Swiss art historian and Indologist, states is a time division symbolizing the cosmic wheel. The eighteen arms express Natya mudras (symbolic hand gestures), with some holding objects such as drums, a flame torch, a serpent, a trident and an axe. Shiva has his son Ganesha and the bull Nandi by his side. Adjoining the Nataraja, the wall depicts the goddess Durga of Shaktism tradition slaying the buffalo-demon Mahishasura.|$|E

2500|$|The William Moss House is {{a two-story}} duplex located at 528 West Genesee Street. This {{house was built}} in {{approximately}} 1908, and is unusual in Iron County as a middle-class duplex, more so because the floor plans {{of the first and}} second floor are dissimilar. It is likely that the original owner, William Moss, occupied the first floor and let out the second. The house is a two-story structure with hipped roof, bracketed eaves, and narrow clapboard siding. It has an Ionic front porch and <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern</b> window sash.|$|E

2500|$|The two entrances {{are further}} defined by side piers and two piers {{directly}} above which {{are decorated with}} raised stone shafts stepping and terminating with floral motifs halfway up the third story. [...] An ornate terra cotta belt separates {{the second and third}} stories. [...] Simple raised edge banding occurs in stone between the eleventh and twelfth stories. The building has no cornice; {{it was one of the}} first buildings in the area to dispense with them. Above the twelfth story, the attic story, is a blind frieze of checkered stonework, terminating in a toothy crown formed by the rise of the piers above the parapet in stepped, zigzag finials. [...] The spandrels between the buildings windows were cast in a <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern</b> and set flush with the piers, spreading the checkered motif downward across the entire facade. [...] The building originally had double hung windows on the upper floors, however they were replaced in 1974 with metal-clad windows.|$|E
2500|$|The best-known {{types of}} Archaic {{sculpture}} are the kouros and kore, near life-size frontal statues {{of a young}} man or woman, which were developed around the middle of the seventh century BC in the Cyclades. [...] Probably the earliest kore produced was the Dedication of Nikandre, which was dedicated to Artemis at her temple on Delos between 660 and 650 BC, while kouroi began to be created shortly after this. [...] Kouroi and korai were used to represent both humans and divinities. [...] Some kouroi, such as the Colossus of the Naxians from around 600 BC, are known to represent Apollo, while the Phrasikleia Kore was meant to represent a young woman whose tomb it originally marked. Early in the seventh century around 650 BC when kore are widely introduced, Daedalic style made an appearance in Greek sculpture. This style consisted most noticeably of a <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern</b> of female subjects' hair framing their face. On male sculptures they were often posed with one foot in front, as if in motion.|$|E
60|$|The rain {{shut out}} the distance, and the hood and oil-paper apron eclipsed the foreground. The loss was not great, to judge by what {{specimens}} of the view I caught at intervals. The landscape was a <b>geometric</b> <b>pattern</b> in paddyfields. These, as yet unplanted, were swimming in water, out of which stuck the stumps of last year's crop. It was a tearful sight. Fortunately the road soon rose superior to it, passed through a cutting, and came out unexpectedly above the sea,--a most homesick sea, veiled in rain-mist, itself a disheartening drab. The cutting which ushered us somewhat proudly upon this inhospitable outlook {{proved to be the}} beginning of a pass sixty miles long, between the Hida-Shinshiu mountains and the sea of Japan.|$|E

50|$|Growth strata, {{also known}} as syntectonic strata, are {{sedimentary}} layers that are deposited {{at the same time}} as folding. These layers are characterized by decreasing thickness of strata towards crest of an anticline(fig 1).

50|$|Patterns {{often have}} their origins in early ideographs. <b>Geometric</b> <b>{{patterns}}</b> {{and patterns of}} plant, animal and nature motifs are the four most basic <b>patterns.</b> <b>Geometric</b> <b>patterns</b> include triangles, squares, diamonds, zigzags, latticework, frets, spirals sawteeth, circles, ovals and concentric circles. Stone Age rock carvings feature animal designs in order to relate to food-gathering activities. These patterns are found doors of temples and shrines, clothes, furniture and daily objects such as fans and spoons.|$|R
