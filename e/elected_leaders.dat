5|$|A {{few days}} after the war began, the Chartered Company formed the Rhodesian Reserves, an {{amorphous}} entity intended to accommodate the many white men who were keen to put on uniform, as well as to make a start towards organising what might eventually become an expeditionary force. Eminent citizens and <b>elected</b> <b>leaders</b> formed their own platoons, each bringing 24 volunteers; three or four of these 25-man troops made a company. Units representing the Caledonian Society, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Society, the Legion of Frontiersmen and other local organisations mirrored the Pals battalions in Britain. Volunteers could opt to serve overseas, within Rhodesia or only locally; around 1,000 had volunteered in all by 13 August.|$|E
5|$|Cossacks {{were first}} semi-nomadic, then also settled East Slavic {{people of the}} Dnieper River area, who practiced brigandage and plunder, and, renowned for their {{fighting}} prowess, early in their history assumed a military organization. Many of them were, or originated from run-away peasants from the eastern and {{other areas of the}} Commonwealth or from Russia; other significant elements were townspeople and even nobility, who came from the region or migrated into Ukraine. Cossacks considered themselves free and independent of any bondage and followed their own <b>elected</b> <b>leaders,</b> who originated from the more affluent strata of their society. There were tens of thousands of Cossacks already early in the 17th century. They had frequently clashed with the neighboring Turks and Tatars and raided their Black Sea coastal settlements. Such excursions, executed by formal subjects of the Polish king, were intolerable {{from the point of view}} of foreign relations of the Commonwealth, because they violated peace or interfered with the state's current policy toward the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Arafat {{moved to}} Gaza City, which was {{controlled}} by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)—the provisional entity created by the Oslo Accords. Arafat became the President and Prime Minister of the PNA, the Commander of the PLA and the Speaker of the PLC. In July, after the PNA was declared the official government of the Palestinians, the Basic Laws of the Palestinian National Authority was published, in three different versions by the PLO. Arafat proceeded with creating a structure for the PNA. He established an executive committee or cabinet composed of twenty members. Arafat also replaced and assigned mayors and city councils for major cities such as Gaza and Nablus. He began subordinating non-governmental organizations that worked in education, health, and social affairs under his authority by replacing their <b>elected</b> <b>leaders</b> and directors with PNA officials loyal to him. He then appointed himself chairman of the Palestinian financial organization that {{was created by the}} World Bank to control most aid money towards helping the new Palestinian entity.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of antiquity, monarchy confronted several republican forms of government, wherein executive power was {{in the hands of}} a number of people, that <b>elected</b> <b>leaders</b> in a certain way instead of appointing them by hereditary succession. During the archaic period (c. 750–500 BCE), kingship disappeared in almost all Greek poleis, and also in Rome (then still a barely significant town). After the demise of kingship, the Greek city-states were initially most often led by nobility (aristocracy), after which their economic and military power base crumbled. Next, in almost all poleis tyrants usurped power for two generations (tyranny, 7th and especially 6th century BCE), after which gradually forms of governments led by the wealthy (oligarchy) or assemblies of free male citizens (democracy) emerged in Classical Greece (mainly after 500 BCE). Athenian democracy (6th century–322 BCE) is the best-known example of the latter form; classical Sparta (c. 550–371 BCE) was a militaristic polis with a remarkable mix between monarchy (dual kingship), aristocracy (Gerousia) and democracy (Apella); the Roman Republic (c. 509–27 BCE) had a mixed constitution of oligarchy, democracy and especially aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|The largely free {{elections}} of 1950 were {{won by the}} popular Árbenz, and represented the first transfer of power between democratically <b>elected</b> <b>leaders</b> in Guatemala. Árbenz had personal ties to {{some members of the}} communist PGT, which was legalized during his government, and a couple of members played a role in drafting the new president's policies. Nonetheless, Árbenz did not try to turn Guatemala into a communist state, instead choosing a moderate capitalist approach. The PGT too committed itself to working within the existing legal framework to achieve its immediate objectives of emancipating peasants from feudalism and improving workers' rights. The most prominent component of Árbenz's policy was his agrarian reform bill. Árbenz drafted the bill himself, having sought advice from economists across Latin America. The focus of the law was on transferring uncultivated land from large landowners to poor laborers, who would then be able to begin viable farms of their own.|$|E

25|$|The {{publicity}} of the Commission hearings, however, led {{to pressure}} on <b>elected</b> <b>leaders</b> {{to get tough}} on labor racketeers. On May 31, 1984, attorneys with the U.S. Department of Justice sought approval to prosecute Presser for payroll padding based on DOL reports.|$|E

25|$|In January 1952, RWDSU {{unanimously}} {{adopted a}} resolution inviting any disaffiliated locals {{to rejoin the}} parent union. DPOWA elections held in June 1952 led to the ouster of most DPOWA officers, removing those <b>elected</b> <b>leaders</b> who had opposed the anti-communist affidavit requirement. In 1954, DPOWA rejoined the RWDSU and became known as District 65.|$|E
25|$|On May 15, 1918, the U.S. Department of Justice {{ordered the}} arrest of 21 Phelps Dodge executives, {{including}} some from the Calumet and Arizona Co., and several <b>elected</b> <b>leaders</b> and law enforcement officers from Bisbee and Cochise Counties.

25|$|In 1967, Florida's {{schools were}} {{suffering}} from a large influx of students. The post-World War II baby boom, U.S. migration, and emigration into the state had caused school enrollment to rise by more than 50 percent, yet little school building or hiring of new personnel had taken place. The underfunding of Florida public schools was acknowledged by most <b>elected</b> <b>leaders,</b> but there seemed little public demand for increased school funding.|$|E

25|$|Reagan's Vice President, Bush, won the 1988 {{election}} to succeed him. Bush also found {{need for the}} counsel of Strauss. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was attempting to reform the country's communist system and to forge a new relationship with the United States.

25|$|Crowds {{lined the}} streets in each {{municipality}} to welcome their new <b>elected</b> <b>leaders.</b> In Belize City, during {{the midst of the}} counting, Channel 7 cameraman Alfonso Noble and Assistant Commissioner of Police, Eastern Division, Crispin Jeffries got into a tangle when Noble and other media personnel would not leave the counting station immediately. As Noble was being forcibly removed, Jeffries was heard to threaten Noble with future harm if they ever met again. This incident eventually faded.|$|E
25|$|Gandhi's first {{action as}} Prime Minister was passing the anti-defection law in January 1985. According to this law, an elected Member of Parliament or {{legislative}} assembly could not join an opposition party {{until the next}} election. Historian Manish Telikicherla Chary calls it a measure of curbing corruption and bribery of ministers by switching parties so they could gain majority. Many such defections occurred during the 1980s as <b>elected</b> <b>leaders</b> of the Congress party joined opposition parties.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} Sri Lanka became {{independent}} in 1948, about 60% of government jobs were held by Tamils, who formed hardly 15% of the population. The popularly <b>elected</b> <b>leaders</b> {{of the country}} saw it as an outcome of a strategy by the British to control the majority Sinhalese {{that needed to be}} redressed. These measures deteriorated the already frail political relationship between the communities and many experts believe it as one of the main causes of the Sri Lankan Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The {{passage of}} the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 {{triggered}} a crisis within the union. A large number of New York-area local union <b>elected</b> <b>leaders</b> refused to sign the anti-communist affidavits required by the act. This prevented their local unions from participating in elections sponsored by the National Labor Relations Board. To resolve the organizing impediment, the national RWDSU leadership suspended the local officers. Eight of the largest New York locals, representing 30,000 to 40,000 workers, disaffiliated from the union and formed the Distributive Workers Union.|$|E
25|$|The civitates peregrinae {{were often}} {{ruled by the}} {{descendants}} of the aristocracies that dominated them when they were independent entities in the pre-conquest era, although many of these may have suffered severe diminution of their lands during the invasion period. These elites would dominate the civitas council and executive magistracies, which would be based on traditional institutions. They would decide disputes according to tribal customary law. If the chief town of a civitas was granted municipium status, the <b>elected</b> <b>leaders</b> of the civitas, and, later, the entire council (as many as 100 men), were automatically granted citizenship.|$|E
