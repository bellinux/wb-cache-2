40|$|Abstract-During {{the process}} of {{carrying}} out K coverage algorithm of WSN to the target area, there are some shortcomings, such as many redundancy nodes will emerge, the process consumes a lot of node energy in the network at the same time, and the process is easily restricted by the outside environmental <b>elements.</b> <b>Countering</b> the shortcomings, this article puts forward an event probability K coverage algorithm. By means of giving different probability value to different monitor degree of the target area nodes, and by way of information exchange and relevance nature between the nodes, the algorithm fixes the smallest nodes collection and the biggest target collection, thus effectively fulfills K coverage to target area nodes, optimizes network resources, reduces energy consumption of the nodes, prolongs the life time of the network. Simulation experiments show that, this algorithm can fulfill K coverage to target area at small cost and increases the whole network life time, has good practical result and stability.

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{formulation of}} quantum mechanics is used to elucidate the mechanism for decoherence, the suppression of interference effects in a system evolving from an initial coherent superposition. Analysis of time-dependent trajectory ensembles, flux maps, and elements of the stress tensor for two composite systems, in one of which the system is uncoupled to the environment, leads to the decoherence mechanism. For the uncoupled case, the quantum force acting on the fluid elements directs flux toward an attractor where the interference feature arises. For the coupled case, the classical force acting on each fluid <b>element</b> <b>counters</b> the quantum force and leads to gradual separation {{of the components of}} the initial superposition. Concomitantly, fluid stress is relieved when flux vectors diverge from a repellor in the mid-region between the separating wavepackets, thus suppressing formation of the interference feature.

30|$|Mobile ad hoc {{networking}} {{is difficult}} in general. In case of CR-VANETs, V 2 V communication {{is more complex}} and difficult because of dynamically evolving topologies and frequent disconnections that are due to vehicles going out of range. This happens more often when the vehicular density is low. Such disconnections can create instability and performance issues for upper layer protocols such as routing and transport (TCP). Some cross-layer strategies to optimize transport protocols, for example TCP, can also be explored such as in [100, 101]. For routing in vehicular networks, some approaches based on delay-tolerant networking (DTN) are becoming popular. DTN approaches can help in improving the stability and performance of routing protocols by providing some tolerance to disruptions. Thus, CR-VANETs routing protocols also need to integrate some DTN <b>elements</b> to <b>counter</b> frequent disconnections, apart from being spectrum aware.|$|R

40|$|Counter and {{compressor}} arrays {{are frequently}} employed in multiplier design to efficiently reduce partial products in VLSI design.

In this work, carry-propagate multioperand adders are employed in smaller blocks and the outputs are merged using double carry-save encoding to increase performance in reconfigurable systems. Hence, a more compact structure is achieved, compared to full redundant partial product reduction scheme providing comparable speed performance with counter array based carry-save structure.

A synchronous design was preferred here for reasons of stability and portability, the technology of choice again being an FPGA.
