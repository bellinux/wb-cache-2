5|$|Scotland in the High Middle Ages is a {{relatively}} well-studied topic and Scottish medievalists have produced {{a wide variety of}} publications. Some, such as David Dumville, Thomas Owen Clancy and Dauvit Broun, are primarily interested in the native cultures of the country, and often have linguistic training in the Celtic languages. Normanists, such as G.W.S. Barrow, are concerned with the Norman and Scoto-Norman cultures introduced to Scotland after the eleventh century. For much of the twentieth century, historians tended to stress the cultural change that took place in Scotland during this time. However, scholars such as Cynthia Neville and Richard Oram, while not ignoring cultural changes, argue that continuity with the Gaelic past was <b>just</b> <b>as,</b> <b>if</b> not more, important.|$|E

25|$|Various {{procedures}} are used if a tie occurs. In tournament play, {{as well as}} in the NHL playoffs, North Americans favour sudden death overtime, in which the teams continue to play twenty-minute periods until a goal is scored. Up until the 1999–2000 season regular season NHL games were settled with a single five-minute sudden death period with five players (plus a goalie) per side, with both teams awarded one point in the standings in the event of a tie. With a goal, the winning team would be awarded two points and the losing team none (<b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they had lost in regulation).|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} some things {{for which it is}} not enough to state a single cause, but several, of which one, however, is the case. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you were to see the lifeless corpse of a man lying far away, it would be fitting to list all the causes of death in order to make sure that the single cause of this death may be stated. For you would not be able to {{establish}} conclusively that he died by the sword or of cold or of illness or perhaps by poison, but we know that there is something of this kind that happened to him.|$|E
25|$|Drinks {{especially}} high in simple sugars, such as {{soft drinks and}} fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase dehydration. A too rich solution in the gut draws water {{from the rest of}} the body, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the person were to drink sea water. Plain water may be used if more specific and effective ORT preparations are unavailable or are not palatable. Additionally, a mix of both plain water and drinks perhaps too rich in sugar and salt can alternatively be given to the same person, with the goal of providing a medium amount of sodium overall. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.|$|E
500|$|During the day, {{the flames}} {{began to move}} eastward from the {{neighbourhood}} of Pudding Lane, straight against the prevailing east wind and towards Pepys's home on Seething Lane and the Tower of London with its gunpowder stores. The garrison at the Tower took {{matters into their own}} hands after waiting all day for requested help from James's official firemen who were busy in the west. They created firebreaks by blowing up houses on a large scale in the vicinity, halting the advance of the fire. In a letter to William Coventry, Pepys wrote that he [...] "saw how horribly the sky looks, all on a fire in the night, was [...] enough to put us out of our wits; and, indeed, it was extremely dreadful, for it looks <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was at us, and the whole heaven on fire." ...|$|E

500|$|Like the tale's {{companion}} piece {{set in the}} Newlands Valley, The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the cat and dog {{story is}} set in a real place, Near Sawrey, and is the only Potter tale to refer to Sawrey by name. Tabitha Twitchit disdainfully comments on her cousin's choice of party guest: [...] "A little dog, indeed! <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there were no CATS in Sawrey!" [...] The characters in the tale were modelled on real world individuals. Ribby's counterpart lived in Sawrey, and Tabitha Twitchit's counterpart lived at Hill Top, though her fictional shop is located in nearby Hawkshead. Dr. Maggotty was drawn from magpies in the London Zoological Gardens. Potter made notes in her sketchbook about the bird's anatomical structure and the colour of its feathers: [...] "Brown black eye, nose a little hookier than jackdaw, less feathered." [...] The bird's tail was over half its total length she noted, and its feathers were [...] "very blue" [...] and parts were green.|$|E
500|$|During filming, Cameron {{made use}} of his virtual camera system, {{a new way of}} {{directing}} motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> shooting live action. According to Cameron, [...] "It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale." [...] Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because {{there is no need for}} repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly. Cameron described the system as a [...] "form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements".|$|E
500|$|Early in 1474, Parliament {{assembled}} and King Edward attempted to reconcile his brothers {{by stating that}} both men, and their wives, would enjoy the Warwick inheritance <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the Countess of Warwick [...] "was naturally dead". The doubts cast by Clarence on the validity of Richard and Anne's marriage were addressed by a clause protecting their rights in the event they were divorced (i.e. of their marriage being declared null and void by the Church) and then legally remarried to each other, and also protected Richard's rights while waiting for such a valid second marriage with Anne. The following year, Richard was rewarded with all the Neville lands {{in the north of}} England, at the expense of Anne's cousin, George Neville. From this point, George seems to have fallen steadily out of King Edward's favour, his discontent coming to a head in 1477 when, following Isabel's death, he was denied the opportunity to marry Mary of Burgundy, the stepdaughter of his sister Margaret, even though Margaret approved the proposed match. There is no evidence of Richard's involvement in George's subsequent conviction and execution on a charge of treason.|$|E

Nevertheless, as Joe realizes that his one-time friend is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> bad <b>as,</b> <b>if</b> not worse than, his predecessor, he refuses to ally with the new regime. For this, Thorne sends Joe to a re-education camp.|$|R

500|$|In February 2015, Neill Blomkamp posted [...] concept art on his Instagram feed, {{saying in}} an {{interview}} that he had been [...] "wanting to make an Alien film for like years and years" [...] and had developed the story and artwork after working on Chappie with Weaver. Weaver responded that she would be willing to reprise her role as Ripley if Blomkamp was directing. On February 18, 2015, it was confirmed that Blomkamp would direct a new Alien film featuring Weaver. Although no official statement was made, the film was believed to disregard the events of Alien 3 and Resurrection, and instead directly follow Aliens. Blomkamp denied these rumors, saying instead that he simply favored the first two films and wanted his to tie into them. Weaver has specified [...] "it's <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>if,</b> you know, the path forks and one direction goes off to Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection and another direction goes off to Neill's movie." [...] In March 2015, Blomkamp reported that the title of the film would not be Alien 5 and further confirmed plans for more than one Alien sequel/prequel.|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} Eastern Spirit roll realistically in the storm, the {{developers}} {{had to write}} a completely new program. They found that making the ship move was easy, but getting it to respond to storm conditions was much more complex. As such, they created a complete roll editor, called the Darkwave editor, which allowed them to control the pitch (when the ship moves on the horizontal axis) and the roll (when it moves on the vertical axis) separately. The combination of moving the ship on both axes allowed the developers to create realistic ship movements. This in turn allowed them to time the exact movement of the ship to coincide with {{what was happening in}} the game without having to use a cutscene. However, creating such a realistic movement system led to camera problems. According to programmer, Claude Levastre, early in development, [...] "the camera was constantly going through the walls because of the roll movement. So we had to develop an inertia-control system for the camera, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a cameraman is using a steadicam behind the hero." [...] Another change brought about by the ship's motion was that initially, the movement patterns of inanimate objects on the ship were scripted, but this was later replaced with real physics.|$|E
500|$|Just as the {{aircraft}} hit takeoff speed, the No.1 Engine and its pylon assembly {{separated from the}} left wing, ripping away a [...] section of the leading edge with it. The combined unit flipped {{over the top of}} the wing and landed on the runway. Robert Graham, supervisor of maintenance for American Airlines, stated: [...] "As {{the aircraft}} got closer, I noticed what appeared to be vapor or smoke of some type coming from the leading edge of the wing and the No. 1 engine pylon. I noticed that the No. 1 engine was bouncing up and down quite a bit and just about the time the aircraft got opposite my position and started rotation, the engine came off, went up {{over the top of the}} wing, and rolled back down onto the runway... Before going over the wing, the engine went forward and up <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it had lift and was actually climbing. It didn't strike the top of the wing on its way, rather it followed the clear path of the airflow of the wing, up and over the top of it, then down below the tail. The aircraft continued a fairly normal climb until it started a turn to the left. And at that point, I thought he was going to come back to the airport." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} shown that since having {{suppressed}} the rampaging Green Goblin personality and becoming the more dominant personality, Osborn has proven to be <b>just</b> <b>as</b> (<b>if</b> not more) evil and cruel. Osborn has demonstrated a high degree of sadism: while in prison, a guard once asked him for his advice in helping his critically ill wife; Osborn's advice led her to a quicker and more agonizing death. As director of H.A.M.M.E.R., he directed his officers to shoot down an airplane full of innocent people just to see whether his enemy Pepper Potts was powerful enough to rescue the passengers with her Rescue armor. His Goblin persona vied for control of his body, as depicted in the January 2010 issue of Dark Avengers, where he is shown writhing on the floor and imploring, apparently to himself, [...] "Why won't this face come off...?", and finally took over when Osborn's Iron Patriot armor was defeated by Captain America and Iron Man {{at the end of the}} [...] "Siege" [...] arc. Since being cured of the Goblin formula, Osborn claims that his sanity has also been restored. However, he has expressed satisfaction at plastic surgery that 'restored' him to a twisted version of his original features, and intended to use a modified version of the formula to essentially 'infect' the entire country of Symkaria to become goblin-level soldiers without the intellectual capacity to defy him.|$|E

2500|$|If the wicket-keeper {{misses the}} ball and it travels {{all the way to}} the {{boundary}}, the batting team scores four byes, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the batsman had hit the ball to the boundary for four runs. In the virtually impossible case that a bouncer bounces so high that it flies directly over the boundary without touching the ground, only 4 byes are awarded. One cannot score a boundary six in byes – nor in leg byes, wides or no balls; a boundary six can only be scored if the ball has made contact with the bat or the hands or gloves holding it.|$|E
2500|$|Short selling {{is a form}} of {{speculation}} that allows a trader to take a [...] "negative position" [...] in a stock of a company.

Next, the trader sells the borrowed shares and delivers them to the buyer who becomes their new owner. [...] The buyer is typically unaware that the shares have been sold short: his transaction with the trader proceeds <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the trader owned rather than borrowed the shares. Some time later, the trader closes his short position by purchasing the same number of shares in the market and returning them to the lender.|$|E
