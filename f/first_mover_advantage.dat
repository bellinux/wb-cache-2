40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, Durban, 2003. This study investigates two {{strategic}} {{issues that}} small pioneering companies should always place emphasis on. Barriers to entry and <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantages</b> carry such strategic significance {{that it should}} be a priority of any pioneering company, regardless of size. Contemporary studies have questioned the absolute ability of barriers to entry to thwart the entrance of new competitors in an industry, or the sustainability of <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantages.</b> The implication being that barriers to entry and <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantages</b> should not be high on a strategic agenda, as initiatives in this regard can be overcome by companies with superior resources, or due to the diverse strategies and objectives of companies. This study considers the case of a small pioneering company and analyses the competitive environment of the industry it intends to enter. The analysis utilises Porter's Five Forces Framework in a modified form. The framework was chosen as it considers the structural determinants of an industry, from which competitive pressure elements such as barriers to entry and <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantages</b> can be identified and analysed. This modification is necessary as <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantages</b> are typically separate considerations for pioneering companies in strategic formulation. This analysis considers the Five Forces of competitive pressure, but replaces <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantages</b> with competitive rivalry, due to the particular circumstances encountered by pioneering companies. The relevant determinants of competitive pressure are then identified and ranked, in terms of priority, to give guidance to the strategic planning, formulation and implementation process. The analysis stops short of developing a full strategic plan but is sufficient to highlight the competitive issues that will need to be considered. The case study illustrates how barriers to entry and <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantages</b> can still be fundamental to the strategic development process, regardless of the resources and strategy of potential entrants. The case study also proposes a model that spatially depicts the prioritisation of the ensuing strategic issues that are precipitated when analysing Porter's Five Forces Framework...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} effects of timing, order and the durability of <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantages</b> by analyzing the stock market reactions to new product introductions and imitations. The major findings are that both timing and order of moves are important and that rival reactions undermine the durability of <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantages.</b> More specifically, (1) early and fast movers achieve greater gains than late and slow <b>movers,</b> and (2) <b>first</b> <b>movers</b> suffer at the time of new product imitations. Copyright Ó 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A special case of <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> research involves the introduction of a new product. A firm that is first to introduce a new product theoretically realizes monopoly profits by being the only player in a particular niche of the marketplace (Lieberman and Montgomery, 1988; Nelson and Winter, 1982; Porter, 1985; Schumpeter, 1934, 1950). However, whether these <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> monopolistic <b>advantages</b> are temporary or more durable will be largely determined by the responses of rivals. By quickly imitating new product introductions, rivals can adversely affect the durability of the <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantages</b> by sharing and/or reducing their potential profit...|$|R

40|$|In {{environmental}} policy <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantages</b> for environmental technologies are often taken for granted. It {{is a popular}} view to see {{the state as a}} political entrepreneur who introduces a certain {{environmental policy}} instrument, e. g. feedin tariffs for renewable energies, and thus becomes the world market leader or the lead market for the respective technology. Against this background, this paper wants {{to find out if the}} idea of <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantages</b> can be justified by theories and empirical evidence from industrial organization and business management studies. After a review of theoretical and empirical papers we see that <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantages</b> are not confirmed by empirical evidence. Thereby the successful innovator is not necessarily the first but very often one of the early movers within the competition of different innovation designs. We show that the success of a timing strategy depends on country-specific lead market potentials, on market and technology characteristics and on the regime of the country-specific regulation. On this basis we derive options for environmental innovation strategies for firms under different circumstances of markets, technologies and regulations. We will see different implications for practical innovation management and innovation policy. Lead markets, environmental innovation, <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> advantages,innovation strategies...|$|R

Building on a data set comprising monthly penetration rates, market concentration, number of active operators, and market shares of 90 followers from 33 OECD countries, we estimate a dynamic growth model.

Furthermore, we find that a follower's rate of convergence to the long-run market share is (4) negatively influenced by the current market concentration and number of active operators; (5) negatively affected by changes in the penetration rate since market entry, which strongly indicates the presence of substantial <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantages</b> for pioneering network operators...|$|R

[...] The political institutional environment favored these “public” enterprises {{during the early years of}} reform, since private businesses faced severe restrictions and discrimination in terms of resources and regulations. Also, the fiscal decentralization of the early 1980s gave greater decision-making power to local governments and linked fiscal revenue to the career potential of local officials, creating strong incentives for them to promote these enterprises. [...] The TVEs moved in to take advantage of the gaps left in the market by the State-Owned Enterprises to produce colorful elastic bands, ID card holders, etc. The TVEs benefited from <b>first</b> <b>mover</b> <b>advantage</b> as there was no competition in the early stages from private firms due to restrictions on the markets.
