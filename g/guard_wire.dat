40|$|Abstract:- In the {{developing}} world much know-how are growing faster and faster as they are becoming reduced, one such is the very large scale integrated design-VLSI. Many trials are faced in VLSI, {{among them is the}} crosstalk frequency. Global buses in deep-submicron (DSM) system-on-chip designs Ingest noteworthy extents of power, have large transmission interruptions and are prone to errors due to DSM noise-crosstalk. Owing to this, crosstalk manifestation on long on-chip buses is progressively becoming a limiting factor in high-speed designs. Crosstalk among nearby wires on the bus may create a remarkable portion of the transmission delay. Placing a <b>guard</b> <b>wire</b> between each signal wire assuages the crosstalk problem but doubles the area used by the bus, which is an objectionable concern. Instead, it is proposed to employ data encoding and decoding for special codes called boundary shift codes to abate crosstalk inside a bus...|$|E

40|$|A solid {{electrolytic}} type hygrometer is described, {{which operates}} with high reliability while providing rapid and sensitive response. A gold foil electrode (16) is wrapped about a hollow glass cylinder (18), a sheet (12) of hygroscopic-electrolytic material is wrapped about the foil, and a wire (14) is wound {{around the outside}} of the electrolytic sheet. Moisture passing between wire turns can be absorbed by the electrolytic material (12), and then dissociated by current passed by the electrodes (14, 16) through the electrolytic material. The cylinder has a slit (20) extending along its length, to allow resilient expansion to press the sheet of electrolytic material firmly against the electrodes. The wire turns lie against one another to cause rapid dissociation of moisture throughout the electrolytic material. Additional <b>guard</b> <b>wires</b> (42, 44, FIG. 2) lie at opposite ends of the electrolytic sheet, and currents pass through them to avoid moisture buildup at the ends of the main wire coil.

40|$|Substrate noise degrades the {{performance}} of analog circuits integrated on the same substrate with digital circuits. In these mixed-signal ICs, the low cost and lower static power consumption of CMOS logic are shadowed by the larger noise generation due to the large rail-to-rail voltages and the sharp current spikes during switching. We have designed and measured a mixed-signal chip, fabricated in a 0. 35 µm CMOS process on an epi-type substrate, which allows us to compare several low-noise digital designs in CMOS. Alternative logic families have been proposed such as current-mode logic [1] or self-timed logic which show orders of magnitude noise reduction, however with increasing static power and delay sensitivity respectively. A few publications exist about low-noise digital CMOS design, e. g. CMOS gates with <b>guard</b> <b>wiring</b> and on-chip decoupling [2], where 67 % noise reduction is achieved, but with considerable area penalty due to the additional circuitry and power rails. The test chip (Figure 16. 6. 1) contains one reference design (REF) and two digital low-noise designs (LN 1, LN 2) with the same basic architecture, shown in Figure 16. 6. 2. LN 1 employs an optimized clock tree to make the supply current flatter and LN 2 employs a separate substrate bias, dual-supply, and on-chip decoupling. REF has an area of 0. 362 mm 2, a maximum speed of 45 MHz and a core power consumption of 112 mW at 42 MHz and 3. 3 V.

40|$|Introduction: due to {{increasing}} development of electricity transmission {{in the country}} and non – compliance with privacy standard residential lines in some cities, many problems for the residents of these areas have been established. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and assess risks in the area of power transmission lines by using William Fine method in hasyrabad and provide a solution is to reduce the effects. Materials & Method: in order to determine the risks, processes and equipment required for power transmission through field visits and interviews with experts, are identified. Since the magnetic field emitted from the power lines as if it is illegal, can be considered as a risk, this parameter is measured in the study area based on the NIEHS standard with 3 D EMF TESTER by four of the 91, 61, 30, 15 meters from the 230 kv tower, And eventually performed with the standard values can be compared. The identified risks by the parameters of William Fine method were scored and prioritization methodology was based on the placement table. Finally, to reduce the risk level, corrective control measures, were presented. Findings: measuring the magnetic field intensity in the study area, showed that field intensity at any desired distance from the most is above the permissible limit and can be considered as a risk. Finally, 41 risk in four categories: health, environmental, safety – technical and natural event by using William Fine method for 13 elements were identified. The highest risk to the wire and electrical transmission line with priority number 900 and minimum risk to the tower, <b>wire</b> <b>guards,</b> <b>wire</b> ground and span were obtained with a risk priority number 25. Discussion & Conclusion: according to the results, the highest levels of safety at risk – health RPN are 900 and 400 respectively that in most cases the cause of risk is non – compliance with privacy standards of electricity transmission lines in residential areas. so, the proposed control strategy to reduce the effects, compliance with the standards of offshore electricity transmission and prevent people from advancing and construction of urban space is provided for the risk...|$|R
