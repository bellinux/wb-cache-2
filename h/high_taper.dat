50|$|The Akademische Fliegergruppe of the Technical University of Darmstadt (Akaflieg Darmstadt) {{was first}} formed in 1921. It was, and is, {{a group of}} {{aeronautical}} students who design and construct aircraft {{as part of their}} studies and with the help and encouragement of their University. Before the Cirrus their sailplanes designs, whilst often advanced, had all been constructed from wood and fabric. It was well known that high performance required large lift to drag ratios, and that these were obtained by using high aspect ratio wings. The 20 m (65 ft 7 in) span wings of the Cirrus had an aspect ratio of 33.6, the highest of any aircraft built at the time, and such slender structures could not be built entirely from wood. Instead, a singe, wide, tapering duralumin spar was built up out of corrugated sheets, with upper and lower skins that formed about one third of each wing surface at the root and more at the tip. Ahead and aft of the spar the wing profile was shaped with wooden ribs and plywood skinned. It was straight tapered in plan, constructed from an inner 10 m (32 ft 10 in) centre section and two outer panels each 5 m (16 ft 5 in) long, with a <b>high</b> <b>taper</b> ratio of 4 and with squared off tips. Strongly tapered wings have a lift distribution which falls rapidly along the span, so the angle of incidence of the wings of the Cirrus initially increased along the span (wash-in), then decreased towards the tips (wash-out), producing a better approximation of the lift distribution to that of the aerodynamically ideal elliptical wing. The outer panels had ailerons along the whole of their trailing edges, and the inner section similarly carried flaps. The ailerons were of the differential type and were interconnected to the rudder to simplify yaw correction. Mid-chord spoilers were fitted on the centre section.|$|E

A stable fixation between ball head and stem-neck taper is critical to avoid excessive interface motions. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} identify the effect of trunnion roughness and length on the modular taper strength under typical intraoperative assembly forces. Custom-made Titanium trunnions (standard/mini taper, smooth/grooved surface finish) were assembled with modular Cobalt-chromium heads by impaction with peak forces ranging from 2 kN to 6 kN. After each assembly process these were disassembled with a materials testing machine to detect the pull-off force as a measure for the taper strength. As expected, the pull-off forces increased with rising peak assembly force (p < 0. 001). For low and moderate assembly forces, smooth standard <b>tapers</b> offered <b>higher</b> pull-off forces compared to grooved tapers (p < 0. 038). In the case of an assembly force of 2 kN, mini <b>tapers</b> showed a <b>higher</b> <b>taper</b> strength than standard ones (p= 0. 037).

40|$|Summary. Multiple linear {{regression}} analysis of fifteen factors showed that bearing surface design {{was the most}} significant predictor of <b>high</b> <b>taper</b> material loss in retrieved metal-on-metal hip replacements. Introduction. Joint registries have reported high revision rates for large diameter metal-on-metal total hip replacements (MOM-THR). It has been speculated that additional cobalt-chrome debris may be released from head-stem taper junction, and {{that this may be}} implicated in clinical failure. However, the mechanisms and clinical significance of taper material loss remain largely unclear. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure the volume of taper material loss in a large series of MOM-THR retrievals, and then by using multiple {{linear regression}} analysis identify any significant predictors of <b>high</b> <b>taper</b> material loss. Methods. This was a retrospective study of 125 consecutively collected large diameter (> 38 mm) MOM retrieval cases, and included six contemporary bearing designs and eight femoral stem designs. We recorded patient demographic data and all commonly reported clinical and design variables, including fifteen variables identified through review of the literature that had been indicated as factors likely to affect the mechanical or electrochemical properties of the head-stem taper junction (Table 1). Post-operatively we measured the volume of material lost from all 280 components. Material loss of the bearing surfaces was measured using a coordinate measuring machine and of the taper surfaces using a roundness measuring machine. We then performed univariable and multiple linear regression analyses to determine the variables significantly associated with high volumes of material loss at the taper junction. Results. The median volume of material loss from the taper junction was 2. 16 mm 3 (range: 0. 13 - 25. 19), significantly (p < 0. 001) less than the median volume of material lost from the bearing surface, which was 5. 79 mm 3 (range: 0. 59 - 309. 17). Full results of all univariable regression analyses are given in Table 1. Univariable analysis identified two significant predictors of <b>high</b> <b>taper</b> material loss: (1) bearing surface design (p = 0. 015) and (2) edge loading of the bearing surfaces (p = 0. 017). The same two variables were confirmed as the only two significant predictors in the final multiple linear regression model (Table 2), and both were independent predictors, with tests for interaction proving non-significant (p = 0. 510). Discussion/Conclusion. It has been speculated that material loss at the head-stem taper junction is implicated in the high revision rates reported for MOM-THR. However, there is little published data to support this and both the clinical significance and mechanism of material loss remains poorly understood. Using multivariable statistical analysis to analyze a large series of retrieval data, we have shown that bearing surface design and edge loading of the bearing surfaces are significant predictors for <b>high</b> <b>taper</b> material loss. This study contributes significantly to our understanding of the mechanisms of MOM hip failure, and suggests important factors that predispose patients to increased metal ion exposure...|$|E

We investigated {{the mechanism of}} late distal SINE, prevention strategies, proper size selection of the stent graft, and implantation sequence. MethodsFrom November 2006 to May 2011, 99 patients with aortic dissection underwent TEVAR with Zenith TX 2 stent grafts (Cook, Bloomington, Ind) at our center. Among them, 27 distal SINEs were recognized. Eight of these patients with complicated distal SINE required intervention with new distal endografts, and all were enrolled for further analysis. ResultsEight of the 27 patients with distal SINE underwent a secondary endograft procedure from February 2011 to July 2011. All were successfully treated without any complications or deaths. A <b>high</b> <b>taper</b> ratio (35 % ± 11 %) and excessive oversizing of the true lumen area at the distal stent level (293 % ± 76 %) were noted among these patients. ConclusionsThe incidence of distal SINE seemed to be high; however, there were also low rates of death and complications after TEVAR for aortic dissection using stainless steel-based stent grafts. Complicated distal SINE can successfully be resolved by distal endograft implantation. Excessive oversizing of the distal stent graft, {{as measured by the}} true lumen area, may be a significant factor causing delayed distal SINE. Precise size selection is crucial for the distal end of the stent, especially for <b>high</b> <b>taper</b> ratio dissection pathology in which the implantation sequence of a distal small-sized stent graft first might be considered to prevent future distal SINE...|$|E

40|$|Most thermal {{models of}} {{subduction}} zones assume no advection of heat by fluid flow because slow flow through underthrusting sediment, the décollement, and wedge likely transports {{only a minor}} amount of heat. We model coupled fluid and heat transport in a subduction zone and show that hydrothermal circulation in subducting basaltic basement rocks can greatly influence subduction zone temperatures. Fractured basaltic basement has permeability several orders of magnitude higher than a typical décollement, allowing fluid circulation to redistribute and extract heat from a subduction zone. We simulate systems with upper basaltic basement permeability ranging from 10 − 13 to 10 − 10 m 2. Additionally, we incorporate the effect of permeability reduction within the basaltic basement as it is subducted. The models with fluid transport show suppressed temperatures along the subducting slab relative to models with no fluid transport. In models where faulted ocean crust exposes high permeability basement to the ocean floor, cooling from ocean bottom water results in highly suppressed heat flow relative to conductive models. With continuous sediment cover, heat is extracted from under the margin wedge to the trench. An important consequence is that hydrothermally cooled ocean crust also acts to slow thermally controlled diagenetic reaction progress within subducting sediment. A sensitivity analysis indicates that hydrothermal circulation is most important for subduction zones with slow convergence rates and <b>high</b> <b>taper</b> angles. ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{influence}} of lateral heat losses from a phase change material (PCM) storage tank {{on the performance of}} a storage integrated solar thermophotovoltaic (SISTPV) system by means of an analytical model. The heat losses from the lateral surface of the PCM tank are modeled using Newton’s law of cooling by prescribing a heat-loss coefficient on the lateral surfaces. The results show that at high heat losses, low thermal efficiencies are realized. Correspondingly larger solar concentrations are required to fully melt the PCM tank. At low heat losses, such as can be expected when using thermal insulation on the lateral surfaces, approximately 40 % thermal efficiency can be realized. The results also demonstrate that a high absorber area:length of PCM tank squared (SR) ratio enables the system to have a high thermal efficiency. For a high-SR, low-heat-loss design case, having a <b>high</b> <b>taper</b> ratio, high area ratio between absorber area and inlet hole area, and small PCM tank length all achieve higher thermal efficiencies. It is expected that these SISTPV systems will be designed at steadystate to be fully molten in order to maximize thermal energy storage via the latent heat of the PCM.

40|$|Means testing {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the UK state pension system. We use a dynamic programming model to consider the effects of a recent policy reform that reduced the marginal tax rates on private income of means tested retirement benefits from 100 % to 40 %. Our analysis suggests that the policy reform will encourage the poorest third of all households to both save more and delay retirement, and have the opposite effects on richer households. The policy reform provides a reasonable compromise between the distortions associated with high marginal tax rates, and the costs of universal benefits provision. Means testing of state pensions has been criticised for discouraging individual savings and work effort, and thereby creating a dependence on the welfare state. Yet means testing does enable benefits to be targeted to poorer households, which supports greater equity of incomes in retirement. Furthermore, <b>high</b> <b>taper</b> rates (also referred to as phase-out or marginal tax rates) provide sharp disincentive effects for relatively small numbers of people, while lower taper rates imply that more people are exposed to weaker disincentive effects.

The important part that is played by the longitudinal trim and stability at incidences near the stall is emphasised. The relation between wing sections and their stalling characteristics is discussed and it is shown that the stalling characteristics can be broadly predicted from an examination of the form of the wing-section upper-surface pressure distribution at high incidences. The results indicate that vicious stalling behaviou) can be avoided by the use of wing sections towards the tip of fairly high camber (3 to 4 per cent.) and moderate thickness (> 12 per cent.). For some types of aeroplanes there are, however, serious objections to tile use of high camber towards the tips; the designer is then advised to avoid wing sections which experiments and theory indicate have particularly bad stalling characteristics.
