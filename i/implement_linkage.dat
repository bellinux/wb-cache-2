40|$|The {{negotiation}} structure at the World Trade Organization (WTO) primarily {{relies on}} the single undertaking, an all or nothing approach that typically precludes separate agreements {{among some of the}} parties or on some of the agenda items. This article argues for a re-examination {{of the value of the}} single undertaking, particularly with reference to developing country Members. With respect to the substantive negotiations, 'linkage' (the inter-dependent regulation of trade and other fields that are deemed to have an impact on trade) has been a powerful principle for the expansion of WTO regulation and the single undertaking has, so far, served as the vector to <b>implement</b> <b>linkage.</b> As a counterpoint, this article argues that linkage can [...] and should be [...] decoupled from negotiation design, particularly from the unquestioned and systematic recourse to the single undertaking. The article offers avenues for redesigning negotiations beyond the old dichotomy of the single undertaking versus 'à-la-carte' approaches. It proposes alternative negotiation structures that take into account the practical realities of many WTO Members with limited institutional capacity as well as the desirability for some Members to liberalize trade at a faster pace.

40|$|If African {{developing}} countries are to benefit fully from the current boom in foreign direct investment (FDI) in extractives (i. e. mining and oil/gas), {{it is essential that}} the foreign investors foster linkages to the local economy. Traditionally, extractive FDI in Africa has been seen as the enclave economy par excellence, moving in with fully integrated value chains, extracting resources and exporting them as commodities having virtually no linkages to the local economy. However, new opportunities for promoting linkages are offered by changing business strategies of local African enterprises as well as foreign multinational corporations (MNCs). MNCs in extractives are increasingly seeking local linkages as part of their efficiency, risk, and asset-seeking strategies, and linkage programmes are becoming integral elements in many MNCs' corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. At the same time, local African enterprises are eager to, and increasingly capable of, linking up to the foreign investors in order to expand their activities and acquire technology, skills and market access. The changing strategies of MNCs and the improving capabilities of African enterprises offer new opportunities for governments and donors to mobilize extractive FDI for development goals. This paper seeks to take stock of {{what we know about the}} state of and driving forces of linkage formation in South Sahel Africa extractives based on a review of the extant literature. The paper argues that while MNCs and local enterprises by themselves will indeed produce linkages, the scope, depth and development impacts of linkages eventually depend on government intervention. Resource-rich African countries' governments are aware of this and linkage promotion is increasingly becoming a key element in their industrialization strategies. A main point of the paper is that the choice between different linkage policies and approaches should be informed by a firm understanding of the workings of the private sector as well as the political and institutional capacity of host governments to adopt and <b>implement</b> <b>linkage</b> policies and approaches...|$|E

40|$|We {{have entered}} a sixth mass {{extinction}} period, and habitat loss due to human land uses {{has been named}} {{as one of its}} leading causes. By converting land to urban and agricultural land uses, humans have fragmented millions of acres of once-contiguous habitat. Fragmentation alters the spatial configuration and ecological processes of the remnant habitat fragments. These ecological changes impact plant and animal species, leading to population declines and, for some, local or total extinction. The impacts of fragmentation are projected to become more pronounced as the climate changes, hindering many species from adapting to novel climate conditions by shifting to a range with more hospitable climate conditions. Corridors can improve species viability in heavily-fragmented landscapes as well as in a changing climate by facilitating movement between separate habitat patches. Establishing broad linkages is logically feasible in areas with large reserves of habitat, primarily in the north-western region of the United States. The rest of the nation, however, lacks large habitat reserves and is dominated by private landownership. How do we establish corridors in landscapes like those in central Illinois or the sprawling metro-Chicago suburbs? <b>Implementing</b> <b>linkages</b> in these landscapes will require a coordinated, inter-governmental effort on landscape and regional scales.

40|$|The pseudohyphal growth {{response}} {{is a dramatic}} morphological transition and presumed foraging mechanism wherein yeast cells form invasive and surface-spread multicellular filaments. Pseudohyphal growth has been studied extensively {{as a model of}} conserved signaling pathways controlling stress responses, cell morphogenesis, and fungal virulence in pathogenic fungi. The genetic contribution to pseudohyphal growth is extensive, with at least 500 genes required for filamentation; as such, pseudohyphal growth is a complex trait, and linkage analysis is a classical means to dissect the genetic basis of a complex phenotype. Here, we <b>implemented</b> <b>linkage</b> analysis by crossing each of two filamentous strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S 1278 b and SK 1) with an S 288 C-derived non-filamentous strain. We then assayed meiotic progeny for filamentation and mapped allelic linkage in pooled segregants by whole-genome sequencing. This analysis identified linkage in a cohort of genes, including the negative regulator SFL 1, which we find contains a premature stop codon in the invasive SK 1 background. The S 288 C allele of the polarity gene PEA 2, encoding Leu 409 rather than Met, is linked with non-invasion. In S 1278 b, the pea 2 -M 409 L mutation results in decreased invasive filamentation and elongation, diminished activity of a Kss 1 p MAPK pathway reporter, decreased unipolar budding, and diminished binding of the polarisome protein Spa 2 p.

40|$|Abstract Background The Centre for Data Linkage (CDL) {{has been}} {{established}} to enable national and cross-jurisdictional health-related research in Australia. It has been funded through the Population Health Research Network (PHRN), a national initiative established under the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). This paper describes {{the development of the}} processes and methodology required to create cross-jurisdictional research infrastructure and enable aggregation of State and Territory linkages into a single linkage “map”. Methods The CDL has <b>implemented</b> a <b>linkage</b> model which incorporates best practice in data linkage and adheres to data integration principles set down by the Australian Government. Working closely with data custodians and State-based data linkage facilities, the CDL has designed and <b>implemented</b> a <b>linkage</b> system to enable research at national or cross-jurisdictional level. A secure operational environment has also been established with strong governance arrangements to maximise privacy and the confidentiality of data. Results The development and implementation of a cross-jurisdictional linkage model overcomes a number of challenges associated with the federated nature of health data collections in Australia. The infrastructure expands Australia’s data linkage capability and provides opportunities for population-level research. The CDL linkage model, infrastructure architecture and governance arrangements are presented. The quality and capability of the new infrastructure is demonstrated through the conduct of data linkage for the first PHRN Proof of Concept Collaboration project, where more than 25 million records were successfully linked to a very high quality. Conclusions This infrastructure provides researchers and policy-makers with the ability to undertake linkage-based research that extends across jurisdictional boundaries. It represents an advance in Australia’s national data linkage capabilities and sets the scene for stronger government-research collaboration. </p...|$|R

Methods We <b>implemented</b> a <b>Linkage</b> Disequilibrium (LD) search with data from the 1000 Genomes Project, on African and European population genomic sequences. Results We found that the p. Ile 2984 Val variation {{is part of a larger}} haplotype in European populations and it is almost absent in west Africans. This haplotype contains 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in very high LD, three of which are missense mutations (p. Leu 2153 Phe, p. Ile 2984 Val, p.

Notably, this European haplotype is absent in west African populations, and the frequency of each individual polymorphism differs significantly in Africans.

By-pedigree multi-point LOD values in MCLINK showed linked pedigrees for all five regions, ranging from 3 linked pedigrees (chromosome 5) to 14 linked pedigrees (chromosome 7), and suggested localizations of between 9 cM and 27 cM in size. Conclusion Reasonable concordance was found across analysis methods. No single method identified all regions, either by full sample LOD or with by-pedigree analysis. Concordance across methods appeared better at the pedigree level, with many regions showing by-pedigree support in MCLINK when no evidence was observed in the full sample. Thus, investigating by-pedigree linkage evidence may provide a useful tool for evaluating linkage regions. </p...|$|R
