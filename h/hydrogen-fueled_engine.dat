This work proposes a common-rail (CR) {{injection system}} for a four-stroke four-cylinder <b>hydrogen-fueled</b> <b>engine</b> with a port-injection feeding system. A numerical one-dimensional gas dynamic model was developed considering a single injection event for each injector per cycle. For this purpose, one-dimensional flow equations in conservation form are used to simulate wave propagation phenomena throughout the CR (accumulator). The effect of the CR on the injection-system characteristics has been clarified. These characteristics include: rail pressure, sound velocity, rail mass flow rate, injected mass flow rate and pressure drop across injectors. The interaction effects of operational conditions (engine speed and rail pressure) and geometrical features (injector hole diameter) are illustrated. The required compromise solutions are highlighted. The CR injection system is shown to be a promising enhancement for the port-injection <b>hydrogen-fueled</b> <b>engine.</b> ...|$|E

The culmination of efforts on many fronts was the excellent comparison of the experimental data from the Onan engine, operated by SNL. These efforts include the following. An extensive study of the intake flow culminated in a major understanding of the interdependence of the details of the intake port design and the engine operating condition on the emissions and efficiency. This study also resulted in design suggestions for future engines and general scaling laws for turbulence that enables the KIVA results to be applied {{to a wide variety of}} operating conditions. The research on the turbulent combustion of hydrogen brought into perspective the effect of the unique aspects of hydrogen combustion and their influence on possible models of turbulent combustion. The effort culminated in a proposed model for turbulent hydrogen combustion that is in agreement with available literature. Future work will continue the development in order to provide a generally predictive model for hydrogen combustion. The application of the combustion model to the Onan experiments elucidated the observed improvement of the efficiency of the engine with the addition of a shroud on the intake valve.

A simplified single-step mechanism was considered for estimating the reaction rate of hydrogen oxidation. The modified wall-function {{was used for}} resolving the near-wall transport. An arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian algorithm was adopted for solving the governing equations. Experimental measurements were implemented to verify the developed model. They show that the instantaneous heat-transfer model is sufficiently accurate. The influence of engine speed, equivalence ratio, {{and the start of}} injection timing were investigated. The flow fields appeared to have greater size vectors and coarser distribution with an increase of engine speed. A heterogeneous distribution was obtained for an ultra-lean mixture condition (φ ≤ 0. 5), which decreased with an increase of equivalence ratio. There was no pronounced influence of the start of injection on the flow field pattern and mixture homogeneity. Thermal field analysis was used to demonstrate trends in the instantaneous heat transfer. It was observed that there was a crucial distinction between the lean and ultra-lean mixtures as well as the engine speed. Furthermore, a non-uniform behavior was found for the impact of the equivalence ratio on temperature distribution. It is clear that the developed models are powerful tools for estimating the heat transfer of the <b>hydrogen-fueled</b> <b>engine.</b> The developed predictive correlation is highly accurate in predicting the heat transfer of the <b>hydrogen-fueled</b> <b>engine,</b> focusing on the equivalence ratio as a governing variable...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a description of}} the time-averaged heat transfer in a direct-injection <b>hydrogen-fueled</b> <b>engine.</b> A computer simulation of the overall heat transfer process within the in-cylinder was run. The experimental results were used to validate the adopted numerical model. One-dimensional gas dynamics were used to describe the flow and heat transfer in the components of the engine model. The engine model was simulated while varying the engine speed, equivalence ratio (φ), and start of injection (SOI) timing, respectively, as follows: 1800 ≤ rpm ≤ 5000, 0. 2 ≤ φ ≤ 1. 2, and 130 ° ≤ SOI ≤ 70 ° before top dead center. The baseline model of the <b>hydrogen-fueled</b> <b>engine</b> was verified through the experimental results, and reasonable agreement was achieved. The results show that the equivalence ratio has {{a significant impact on the}} time-averaged heat transfer characteristics. This is a unique behavior that appears in the case of hydrogen-fueled engines due to the wide flammability range. Delaying the injection timing caused different behavior of the time-averaged characteristics of heat transfer.

This is because of both the low density and the additional insulation required to minimize boiloff (a problem which does not occur with kerosene and many other fuels). The low density of hydrogen further affects the design {{of the rest of the}} vehicle — pumps and pipework need to be much larger in order to pump the fuel to the engine.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in the internal-combustion engine {{is a crucial}} phenomenon because of it affects the engine performance, efficiency and emissions. The aim of this thesis is to characterize the time-averaged heat-transfer and instantaneous heat-transfer of the direct-injection <b>hydrogen-fueled</b> <b>engine.</b> A one-dimensional model was developed based on the gas dynamic and heat-transfer concepts for characterizing the time-averaged heat-transfer. This model was developed using the real engine specifications with the capabilities of GT-POWER software. The dimensionless analysis for TAHT was performed based on the output results from one-dimensional model. The multidimensional model based on the finite volume approach for characterizing the instantaneous heat-transfer. The structural three-dimensional model was constructed and then discretized using the structured hexahedron mesh. The governing equations for reactive flow with the accompanied physical phenomena were solved numerically. A novel subroutine was integrated to simulate the hydrogen-injection process. Simplified single-step mechanism was considered for estimating the reaction rate of hydrogen oxidation. The modified wall-function was used for resolving the near wall transport. Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian algorithm was adopted for solving the governing equations. Whereas the sub-models were solved utilizing the operator splitting approach, then it was incorporated with the main program. The influences of the engine speed, equivalence ratio and start of injection timing were investigated. Experimental study shows that the time-averaged heat-transfer and instantaneous heat-transfer models are adequately accurate. The equivalence ratio and engine speed were observed to have significant impacts on characteristics of the time-averaged heat-transfer as well as instantaneous heat transfer. It was demonstrated that ignoring {{the impact of the}} equivalence ratio on the time-averaged heat-transfer is unjustifiable, especially on the heat-transfer correlation. Accordingly, the equivalence ratio was established in a new correlation form of the time-averaged heat-transfer. The reliability of the newly developed correlation was verified using the Taylor's correlation. The relative error was reduced from 70 % to around 10 %. Thermal field analysis was used for demonstrating the trends of the instantaneous heat transfer. It was observed that there is a crucial distinction between the lean and ultra-lean mixture as well as the engine speed. Furthermore, a non-uniform behavior was found for the impact of the equivalence ratio on the temperature distributions. Moreover, the heat release rate, instantaneous rate of heat loss, cumulative heat loss and heat transfer coefficient were used for monitoring the behaviour of the instantaneous heat transfer. The instantaneous heat transfer parameters were increased around 35 % when increasing the equivalence ratio within the range of the finest operation while these parameters are acquired within 10 % increase for the entire engine speed range. It can be comprehended that the developed models are powerful tools for estimating the heat transfer of <b>hydrogen-fueled</b> <b>engine.</b> The developed predictive correlation is highly recommended for predicting the heat transfer of <b>hydrogen-fueled</b> <b>engine...</b>|$|E

50|$|Launch pad fires due to spilled {{kerosene}} {{are more}} damaging than hydrogen fires, primarily for two reasons. First, kerosene burns about 20% hotter in absolute temperature than hydrogen. The second reason is its buoyancy. Since hydrogen {{is a deep}} cryogen it boils quickly and rises due to its very low density as a gas. Even when hydrogen burns, the gaseous H2O that is formed has a molecular weight of only 18 u compared to 29.9 u for air, so it rises quickly as well. Kerosene {{on the other hand}} falls to the ground and burns for hours when spilled in large quantities, unavoidably causing extensive heat damage that requires time consuming repairs and rebuilding. This is a lesson most frequently experienced by test stand crews involved with firings of large, unproven rocket <b>engines.</b> <b>Hydrogen-fueled</b> <b>engines</b> have special design requirements such as running propellant lines horizontally, so traps do not form in the lines and cause ruptures due to boiling in confined spaces.

This work thus investigates the performance of <b>hydrogen-fueled</b> internal combustion <b>engines,</b> by looking in turn at vehicle performance, engine performance, and finally fundamental combustion phenomena. The cost and carbon-mitigation potential of conventional and hybridised hydrogen-fueled vehicles is investigated via comparison with conventional and hybridised fossil-fueled vehicles as well as battery-electric vehicles. This analysis focuses on Australian market conditions, and considers both embodied and in-service energy consumption and emissions, as well as the total cost of ownership over several timeframes. The hydrogen-fueled vehicles were in general found to be more expensive than the fossil-fueled vehicles, but in most cases offered a lower cost of carbon-mitigation than the plug-in hybrid and battery-electric alternatives. A significant contributor to this result is the cost and embodied energy associated with the larger batteries required for the more highly electrified vehicles. With confirmation that <b>hydrogen-fueled</b> internal combustion <b>engines</b> can be a competitive technology for carbon mitigation, the performance of a production, gasoline-fueled <b>engine</b> converted for <b>hydrogen-fueled</b> operation is then investigated in more detail. A transient engine dynamometer was used to study the effects of engine design parameters [...] including valve timings, throttling, air-fuel ratio, injection timing, compression ratio and turbocharging [...] on combustion stability, emissions, thermal efficiency and performance. Results showed that peak efficiencies were generally obtained during throttle-free operation when 2 <lambda< 3, and that valve timings and air-fuel ratio should be used to control torque to minimise reductions in efficiency. Testing at higher-compression ratios did not result in the expected increases in efficiency. However, it was possible to confirm that preignition and autoignition did not contribute to performance limitations at the ratios tested. In order to link the observed engine behaviour and performance limits to physical phenomena, a combined experimental and numerical model was developed to quantify energy flows through the engine. Particular attention was paid {{to some of the most}} significant challenges in the modelling of <b>hydrogen-fueled</b> <b>engines,</b> specifically the effects of compression ratio, wall temperatures and large variations in air-fuel ratio on in-cylinder heat transfer and combustion behaviour. The modelling of energy flows through the engine was able to link the efficiency peaks observed with respect to lambda to increased in-cylinder heat transfer on the rich side, and increased exhaust enthalpy and decreased combustion rates and stability on the lean side. The modelling also indicated that higher compression ratio tested produced lower exhaust enthalpy flows, but increases in in-cylinder heat transfer of a similar magnitude, resulting in modest changes in efficiency. Further investigation revealed the significance of increased piston surface area, and suggested that a low-area chamber design could offer improved results. Finally, combustion analysis using turbulent flame theory showed that low laminar flame speeds relative to the turbulence intensity in the chamber were the likely cause of the increased combustion variability and fractions of unburned fuel observed as λ increased. Additionally, it appears that at very lean conditions, in-engine hydrogen combustion may deviate from the wrinkled laminar and flamelets in eddies turbulent flame regimes commonly assumed in spark-ignition engines, and tend towards conditions suggestive of the broken reactions and distributed reactions regimes.

Dual fan concepts that have ultra-high bypass ratios, low noise, and low drag will be presented. Flow-controlled turbofans and control-configured turbofans also will be discussed. To increase efficiency, a system of microengines distributed along lifting surfaces and on the fuselage is being investigated. This concept will be presented in the paper. Small propulsion systems for affordable, safe personal transportation vehicles will be discussed. These low-oil/oilless systems use technologies that enable significant cost and weight reductions. Pulse detonation engine-based hybrid-cycle and combined-cycle propulsion systems for aviation and space access will be presented...|$|R
