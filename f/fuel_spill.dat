25|$|Some series use a {{red flag}} when a severe {{accident}} has occurred or to temporarily stop a race {{nearing the end of}} a race. This is usually done when a collision requiring cleanup would otherwise extend the caution period to take longer than the amount of race laps available to finish the race, when a <b>fuel</b> <b>spill</b> occurs on the circuit, or to maximize safety team work. During such a red-flag period, cars are directed to stop in line at a specific point on the track, usually directly opposite to the incident.|$|E

2500|$|Rowe was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} the on-camera host as well and he appeared in taped footage as himself during the first season of shooting. As filming of the first season was nearing completion, Discovery greenlighted production on another Rowe project, Dirty Jobs, under the condition that Rowe choose only one show on which to appear on camera. As Rowe relates the story, Discovery told him that the two shows would be airing back-to-back on the same night, thus, [...] "We can't have you telling us stories about six dead fishermen on camera and making a fart joke with your arm in a cow's ass." [...] Most of the footage Rowe shot during the first season became part of the first season's [...] "Behind the Scenes" [...] episode. After the third season of Deadliest Catch, Rowe began hosting a post-season behind-the-scenes miniseries entitled After the Catch, a roundtable discussion featuring the captains relating their experiences filming the preceding season's episodes. A season 3 episode of Dirty Jobs (2007-2008) saw Rowe return to Alaska {{to take part in a}} job tangentially related to the fishing industry — diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>spill</b> cleanup. Another episode that same season featured Rowe at work on board the F/V Legacy doing trawl fishing and at-sea shellfish and other seafood processing, during which Rowe made numerous references to the crab fishing of Deadliest Catch.|$|E
2500|$|The aircraft's right {{horizontal}} stabiliser {{was found}} by a fisherman, south of Pare Pare, about [...] off the beach on 11 January, {{although it was not}} originally handed in, as its discoverer thought it to be a piece of plywood, only later realising it was a piece of the tail. This was confirmed by the part number on the stabiliser, 65C25746-76, which matched that of components on the missing 737. The fisherman received a reward of 50 million rupiah (equivalent to about $5,500) for his discovery. Later, other parts of the aircraft, including passenger seats, life jackets, a food tray, part of an aircraft tire, eight pieces of aluminium and fibre, an ID card, a flare and a headrest were also recovered from the area. By 13 January, a piece of a wing was also recovered. It is unclear whether the [...] long section was a section of the right wing or the left wing, although it was examined in an attempt to discover this. The total count of recovered objects associated with aircraft, as of 29 January, was 206, of which 194 were definitely from the 737. On 15 January, an unidentified <b>fuel</b> <b>spill</b> was spotted by the Singaporean reconnaissance aircraft along the western coast of Sulawesi, but by the time a ship arrived to attempt to determine whether the spill came from the aircraft, it had been moved by strong currents. Although it was searched for, it was not relocated. Pieces of clothing thought to belong to passengers were also recovered, and on 15 January, pieces of human hair and what is thought to be human scalp were recovered from a headrest that had been pulled from the sea. They were DNA tested to attempt to identify them; the results of this test are, however, unknown.|$|E

50|$|Aviation fuel {{can cause}} severe {{environmental}} damage; all fueling vehicles must carry equipment to control <b>fuel</b> <b>spills.</b> Fire extinguishers must {{be present at}} any fueling operation. Airport firefighting forces are specially trained and equipped to handle aviation <b>fuel</b> fires and <b>spills.</b> Aviation <b>fuel</b> must be checked daily and before every flight for contaminants such as water or dirt.|$|R
50|$|After the derailment, diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>spilled</b> {{from the}} {{locomotives}} and ignited, and the locomotives, the baggage car, {{and the day}} coach were engulfed in flames. The two crew members {{in each of the}} locomotives were killed.|$|R
50|$|Officials {{balance the}} {{potential}} for <b>fuel</b> <b>spills</b> inherent in such operations against the critical need to keep McMurdo Station supplied with oil. A <b>fuel</b> tank <b>spill</b> in an unrelated onshore incident in 2003 spilled roughly 25000 L of Diesel fuel at a helicopter pad at McMurdo Station. The 1989 grounding of the Argentinean ship Bahia Paraiso and subsequent spillage of 640000 L of oil into the sea near the Antarctic Peninsula showed the environmental hazards inherent in supply missions to Antarctica.|$|R

50|$|Ashland {{was fined}} $2.25 {{million by the}} Federal Government. It {{was at the time}} the largest fine levied on an oil company after a <b>fuel</b> <b>spill.</b> Ashland was charged with two misdemeanors: one for violating the Clean Water Act and another for violating the Federal Refuse Act. Ashland paid about $18 million in cleanup fees and civil {{lawsuits}} from those distressed by the experience.|$|E
5000|$|On June 27, 2011, the Oakland Fire Department and California Department of Fish and Game {{responded to}} a diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>spill</b> that covered five acres of the {{northwest}} side of the lake.

50|$|Environmental {{contamination}} {{was first}} detected in 1986 with PCBs from a leaking transformer and a jet <b>fuel</b> <b>spill</b> on the base. A 1991 site {{investigation by the}} Navy found soil to be contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and heavy metals from wastes stored in three landfills. Groundwater samples were contaminated primarily with heavy metals. Since 1993 the station {{has been on the}} National Priorities List of Superfund sites.|$|E
50|$|Use of {{methanol}} fuel {{reduces the}} exhaust emissions of certain hydrocarbon-related toxins such as benzene and 1,3 butadiene, and dramatically reduces long term groundwater pollution caused by <b>fuel</b> <b>spills.</b> Unlike benzene-family <b>fuels,</b> methanol will rapidly and non-toxically biodegrade with no long-term {{harm to the}} environment {{as long as it is}} sufficiently diluted.|$|R
50|$|On November 1, Governor Christie lifted {{mandatory}} {{evacuation orders}} in Atlantic and Cape May counties.It was announced on November 5 that the Coast Guard recovered 780,000 gallons (1,102,061 liters) of an oily mixture from Kinder Morgan's Perth Amboy terminal. Around 7,700 gallons (29146 liters) of <b>fuel</b> <b>spilled</b> from Phillips 66's Bayway Refinery in Linden.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft {{surge tanks}} are {{used on a}} select few {{aircraft}} to ensure that <b>fuel</b> does not <b>spill</b> over onto the ground when the fuel expands. These tanks must be periodically emptied to prevent <b>fuel</b> from <b>spilling,</b> which they do fairly often.|$|R
50|$|The 2011 Nairobi {{pipeline}} {{fire was}} caused by an explosion secondary to a <b>fuel</b> <b>spill</b> in the Kenyan capital Nairobi on 12 September 2011. Approximately 100 {{people were killed in}} the fire and at least 116 others were hospitalized with varying degrees of burns. The incident was not the first such pipeline accident in Kenya, with the Molo fire of 2009 resulting in at least 133 fatalities and hundreds more injured.|$|E
50|$|The Nigerian Aircraft Investigation Bureau {{started an}} {{investigation}} {{for the cause}} of the crash with representatives from the U.S National Transportation Safety Board. Investigators examined the wreckage and the crash site. Based on their examination, the left wing of the aircraft first made contact with a tree branch. The aircraft impacted the ground with a high nose up position and an extreme left bank. The airplane disintegrated and a <b>fuel</b> <b>spill</b> ignited an inferno.|$|E
50|$|Green Oaks Boulevard {{has been}} the site for several deadly {{automobile}} accidents, due to the road's high speed limit. A series of three major accidents during {{a short period of}} time in the fall of 2011. The first of the crashes occurred on August 11, 2011, when a wrong way driver collided with an 18-wheeler gas truck, and caused a large <b>fuel</b> <b>spill</b> at an intersection with the I-20 feeder road, that closed a portion of I-20 for several hours.|$|E

50|$|About {{half of its}} 300 tons of <b>fuel</b> <b>spilled</b> {{into the}} sea. Some of such oil washed ashore along Gibraltars western coast, {{particularly}} {{in the area of}} Rosia Bay and Camp Bay. Spanish sources said that some fuel from Fedra had washed up on some Campo beaches having drifted as far as Tarifa. There were also oil slicks in the Bay of Gibraltar.|$|R
50|$|United States Antarctic Program (USAP) workers {{conducted}} a concerted cleanup {{at the station}} during the 1989-1990 and 1990-1991 summer research seasons. <b>Fuel</b> <b>spills</b> {{are known to have}} occurred in the area. As late as 2001, spills more than 40 years old were still visible. Contemporary operations include the collection of human waste at the station which is collected and transported to McMurdo Station.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 2002, it {{was only}} {{required}} that the crew member operating the fuel rig was to wear a helmet. It was to protect from fire {{in case of a}} <b>fuel</b> <b>spill,</b> and protect him in case he lost his balance. His position between the front and rear axles was deemed particularly precarious. The tire changers did not wear helmets, {{despite the fact that they}} were more exposed and vulnerable to injury from other cars entering and exiting the pit lane.|$|E
50|$|Cross-lay hose beds in {{the main}} body offer {{convenient}} access to fire hoses {{that can be used}} for structural fires or to draw water from a hydrant or natural source such as a river or pond. On the underside of the P-19R there are nozzles that can discharge 56 liters of water and foam to extinguish a fire or <b>fuel</b> <b>spill</b> underneath the vehicle. In front of the vehicle Oshkosh has installed nozzles that spray water and foam on the windshield to keep it cool.|$|E
5000|$|On July 8, 2009, Pacific Wings {{temporarily}} suspended its Hawaii operations a {{day after}} an alleged confrontation between airline employees and Securitas airport police attempting to deliver a citation to Gabe Kimbrell, the airline's president and chief operations officer, {{in connection with a}} <b>fuel</b> <b>spill</b> and alleged improper storage of fuel in the airline's Kahului hangar the previous month. [...] The airline resumed flights two days later, announcing that it was reducing service to just three routes, completely eliminating service to Kona and increasing ticket prices.|$|E
5000|$|... 2011 marked one of {{the largest}} “green initiatives” in the fifty plus year history of NASCAR when all fuel sources were to include Ethanol in a blend called E15. [...] One {{unintended}} consequence of the conversion was higher horsepower and therefore slightly lower fuel economy. It is argued however, that the reduction in fuel economy and the resultant increase in fuel use may offset any environmental impact savings by reduced emissions. Although not connected to the fuel blend, a new “Dry Break” self-venting fuel supply can was also adopted in part for safety (reduced the number of people working on the racecar during a pit stop) but also in part {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>fuel</b> <b>spilled</b> during a pit stop, which has both environmental and safety implications. The reduced fuel spillage is negligible at best when observing a pit stop as <b>fuel</b> <b>spills</b> are common and during competition there is no real method to determine with any certainty the volume of fuel lost.|$|R
50|$|On 14 August 1996, a Canadian Forces CF-18 Hornet {{left the}} runway during takeoff, slid down an {{embankment}} and ruptured a fuel pipeline. The aircraft caught fire, as did <b>fuel</b> <b>spilling</b> from the pipeline, however the pilot had ejected {{just as the}} plane left the runway and suffered a broken ankle. The pipeline was shut down and the fire brought under control {{in less than an}} hour.|$|R
25|$|When Flight 420 {{was near}} the runway threshold, the {{severely}} damaged left wing failed. The aircraft then rotated 90 degrees to the left: <b>fuel</b> <b>spilled</b> from the aircraft and ignited. The aircraft spiralled and crashed, coming {{to rest on the}} left side of Runway 24L. All 2 crew members and 9 passengers on board were killed. 2 passengers initially survived the crash, but ultimately died of their injuries.|$|R
