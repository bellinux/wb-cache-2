500|$|Mark Ruffalo {{began his}} role as Banner / Hulk in The Avengers, after Feige said {{he chose not to}} bring back Norton. In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be {{associated}} with only one character. In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to Collider that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film. In a Q session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions are underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in The Avengers. In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] and [...] "World War Hulk" [...] storylines, stated, [...] "everything [...] is on the table. Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in Avengers? <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until Avengers 2. So there's a lot of time to think about it." ...|$|E

In May 2009, Cheney {{spoke of his}} support for same-sex marriage, {{becoming one of the}} most prominent Republican politicians to do so. Speaking to the National Press Club, Cheney stated: [...] "People ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish, any kind of arrangement they wish. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe,</b> historically, the way marriage has been regulated is at a state level. It's always been a state issue, and I think that's the way it ought to be handled today." [...] In 2012, Cheney reportedly encouraged several Maryland state legislators to vote to legalize same-sex marriage in that state.|$|E
500|$|Along with Ness Wadia, Mohit Burman and others, Zinta {{acquired}} ownership {{rights in}} 2008 for the Mohali-based Twenty20 cricket {{team of the}} Indian Premier League (IPL). The group paid $76million to acquire the franchise, and had since named the team Kings XI Punjab. Until 2009, Zinta {{was the only woman}} to own an IPL team, and was the league's youngest owner. She has been involved with launching ticket sales and promoting the team. She said, [...] "My involvement with the team is total. I am extremely passionate about our team and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that I am the team's good luck factor, so I want to be there for everything."

[...] Eisenhower's phrasing, [...] "as analyzed for me by the Secretary of State," [...] led Bricker and other conservatives to blame Dulles for misleading Eisenhower, and raised their suspicion that the Secretary of State was a tool of Eastern internationalist interests.|$|E

500|$|The {{placement}} {{of a character}} of indigenous peoples descent in science fiction was highlighted in the media. Drew Hayden Taylor said that Chakotay was [...] "erhaps the most well-known". Of Chakotay's origin, he said, [...] "They never actually say what nation he is, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> it's some Central American tribe." [...] Hayden Taylor wrote in a later article in 2012 describing the rise of Native American characters in the Twilight film series that Chakotay was still the sole popular example of a Native American character in science fiction. Chakotay was also described as [...] "the only First Nations role model around in a futuristic setting" [...] in the 2005 book, [...] "Indian" [...] Stereotypes in TV Science Fiction: First Nations' Voices Speak Out, but was {{also referred to as}} the [...] "quintessential Tonto in outer space". A similar criticism was highlighted of the character in Medicine Bags and Dog Tags: American Indian Veterans from Colonial Times to the Second Iraq War (2008), which called Chakotay [...] "a creature of white fantasies" [...] and suggested that he was [...] "far more stereotypical than Tonto" [...] as [...] "at least Tonto was heroic and saved the Lone Ranger once in awhile".|$|E
500|$|Sharp {{criticism}} from Catholic Church authorities put Ferraro {{on the defensive}} during the entire campaign, with abortion opponents frequently protesting her appearances {{with a level of}} fervor not usually encountered by pro-choice Catholic male candidates such as Mario Cuomo and Ted Kennedy. In a 1982 briefing for Congress, Ferraro had written that [...] "the Catholic position on abortion is not monolithic and there can be a range of personal and political responses to the issue." [...] Ferraro was criticized by Cardinal John O'Connor, the Catholic Archbishop of New York, and James Timlin, the Bishop of Scranton, for misrepresenting the Catholic Church's position on abortion. After several days of back-and-forth debate in the public media, Ferraro finally conceded that, [...] "the Catholic Church's position on abortion is monolithic" [...] but {{went on to say that}} [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that there are a lot of Catholics who do not share the view of the Catholic Church". Ferraro was also criticized for saying that Reagan was not a [...] "good Christian" [...] because, she said, his policies hurt the poor. To defend Ferraro, the pro-choice group Catholics for a Free Choice placed an October 7, 1984, full-page ad in The New York Times titled [...] "A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion".|$|E
500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sanders is a {{self-described}} democratic socialist, and progressive who admires the Nordic model of social democracy {{and is a}} proponent of workplace democracy. In November 2015, Sanders gave a speech at Georgetown University about his view of democratic socialism, including {{its place in the}} policies of presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. In defining what democratic socialism means to him, Sanders said: [...] "I don't believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America, companies that create jobs here, rather than companies that are shutting down in America and increasing their profits by exploiting low-wage labor abroad." [...] Based on Sanders's positions and votes throughout his political career, Noam Chomsky and Thomas Frank have described Sanders as [...] "a New Dealer".|$|E
