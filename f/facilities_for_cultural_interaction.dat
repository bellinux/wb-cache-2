The author emphasizes the necessity of creating new periodization for the Japan-China interaction，based not on each history but on the interaction itself. [URL]...|$|R

Ibn Fadlan gives a vivid description of the daily habits of the Rus, as well as the only known first-person account of the complicated ship-burning funeral ceremony.

The small playground was renamed Cheongnyeon Gwanjang (Youth Square) and given a neater look.

These musicians introduced the traditional orchestration and other influences of fado, {{such as the use}} of guitars, mandolins, drum sets, and other conventional Western instruments, to Mozambique. The Catholic Church, as a site <b>for</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>interaction,</b> also played a role in the development of the new genre, contributing influences of tonal harmony and the basic use of progressions like I-IV-V. Mozambican musicians combined the influences of church music, secular Western music, and African rhythms to create an entirely new genre.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose that}} {{employees}} who are highly motivated <b>for</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>interactions</b> (motivational <b>cultural</b> intelligence) and can modify their thinking about cultural differences (metacognitive cultural intelligence) {{are more likely to}} be creative in culturally diverse environments. Based on the social categorization theory, we propose that metacognitive and motivational cultural intelligence will be positively related to individual creativity. Moreover, we predict that metacognitive and motivational cultural intelligence can decrease the negative aspects of the social categorization process and, in turn, be positively related to creativity. A quantitative analysis of 787 employees in 20 SME multicultural companies in the Adriatic region shows that metacognitive and motivational cultural intelligence are in fact positively related to individual creativity. We discuss the implications for practice and future research...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore the {{question}} of what is unique and special about modern humans (homo sapiens) from the perspective of evolutionary anthropology and cognitive science. I frst give a brief overview of the evolution of the human brain. Then I discuss six candidates for what makes human cognition unique: (1) the ability to adopt a shared perspective (2) symbolic, analogical reasoning (3) a Theory of Mind (4) the creation of a symbolic 'niche' with shared cultural artefacts and norms (5) mental time travel (6) language. Most importantly, a comparison of the sociocognitive capacities and motivations of humans and other primates indicates that humans might possess a unique adaptation <b>for</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>interaction,</b> transmission and learning. This is already evident in infants and young children, who show unique abilities and motivations in the domain of sharing intentions, understanding joint commitments, and sharing attention and other psychological states...|$|R
50|$|A digital space {{can take}} any {{of a variety of}} forms: chat rooms, social media networks, blogs, private journals, news sites, {{question}} and answer forums, professional marketing pages, online shopping sites, etc. Additionally, digital space allows <b>for</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>interaction</b> {{in a way that is}} not possible in analog device spaces. It is important to note that the internet is a social construction, designed for social interaction among various contexts (including economic, discursive, etc.). To this end, digital spaces can be manipulated, adapted, or even created for different, specific functions. Consider Wikipedia: “the free encyclopedia anyone can edit.” This site encourages individuals to share more information, making verified knowledge public and collaborative. Another example is Douglas Eyman's text Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice. Eyman wrote a print and a digital version of this text and includes a statement encouraging readers to take, revise, reuse, and circulate his original text, which is why he made the book available for free online.|$|R

50|$|Following {{the drought}} of 1877- 78 Hammell no longer owned the hotel. After passing through several owners, it was {{purchased}} in 1885 by Cecil Haigh, an Englishman. H.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} opinion leaders or influentials in the collective behavior of a social system. Opinion leaders are characterized by their unidirectional influence on other agents. We employ a model based on Axelrod's dynamics <b>for</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>interaction</b> among social agents that allows for non-interacting states. We find three collective phases {{in the space of}} parameters of the system, given by the fraction of opinion leaders and a quantity representing the number of available states: one ordered phase having the state imposed by the leaders; another nontrivial ordered phase consisting of a majority group in a state orthogonal or alternative to that of the opinion leaders, and a disordered phase, where many small groups coexist. We show that the spontaneous rise of an alternative group in the presence of opinion leaders depends on the existence of a minimum number of long-range connections in the underlying network. This phenomenon challenges the common idea that influentials are fundamental to propagation processes in society, such as the formation of public opinion. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
