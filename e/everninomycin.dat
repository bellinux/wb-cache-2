40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antimicrobial}} activity of SCH 27899 (<b>everninomycin),</b> a novel oligosaccharide compound of the <b>everninomycin</b> class, was compared with vancomycin, chloramphenicol, clinafloxacin, teicoplanin and doxycycline against 428 clinical strains of bacteria. <b>Everninomycin</b> base exhibited the greatest antimicrobial activity {{compared to other}} formulations against all strains tested (MIC 90 : 0. 25 μ/ml) followed by clinafloxacin and teicoplanin (MIC 90 : 0. 5 μg/ml), vancomycin (MIC 90 : 2 μg/ml), and doxycycline (MIC 90 : 16 μg/ml). <b>Everninomycin</b> demonstrated the best activity against Streptococcus spp. (serogroups A, B, C, F, G) and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and lower activity against coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC 90 : 0. 5 μg/ml). All enterococci had an <b>everninomycin</b> MIC of 0. 5 μg/ml or less. <b>Everninomycin</b> had no measurable antimicrobial activity against gram-negative aerobic organisms except Flavo-bacterium meningosepticum (MIC 50 : 2 μg/ml). Some <b>everninomycin</b> activity was observed against Clostridium spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and the Prevotella bivius-disiens group. <b>Everninomycin</b> showed excellent activity (MIC 90 : 0. 25 μg/ml) against the fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and all gram-positive strains resistant to vancomycin (MICs 4 μg/ml). The MBC/MIC ratios and killing curve data suggest that <b>everninomycin</b> is not uniformly or rapidly bactericidal. These in vitro data indicate that <b>everninomycin</b> could be useful against emerging gram-positive strains resistant to other contemporary antimicrobials...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous hypospadias {{is seldom}} {{observed}} in rats {{in contrast to}} its occurrence in 1 out of 250 human births. Ziracin, an antibacterial of the <b>everninomycin</b> class under development for serious enterococcal, staphylococcal, and streptococcal infections, caused anomalies of the external genitalia in F 1 female rats and decreased reproductive performance. To characterize the urogenital malformations and determine the period of sensitivity {{to the effects of}} Ziracin during development, pregnant rats (F 0) were administered 60 mg/kg IV of Ziracin from GD 6 to LD 21, GD 6 to 13, GD 14 to the last day of gestation or LD 0 to 21. Controls received saline or placebo from GD 6 to LD 21. Ziracin-induced changes occurred in F 1 rats exposed from GD 6 to LD 21 and GD 14 to the last day of gestation, indicating that the period of sensitivity to Ziracin was from GD 14 to the last day of gestation. The urogenital abnormalities consisted of cranial displacement of the urethral opening within the vagina from its normal location {{at the tip of the}} genital tubercle. When the urethrovaginal junction occurred at the distal third of the vagina, it created an urogenital cloaca. As a result, ascending infections were seen in the urinary and genital tract. No differences in survivability, body weight, and date of vaginal opening were observed in F 1 females. The estrous cycles were slightly prolonged. The mating and fertility indices were decreased as a result of the urogenital anomalies. The mammary glands of pregnant F 1 females were underdeveloped, thus F 2 pups from affected F 1 females had a decreased survival rate. Although the cause of these effects is not known, the findings are consistent with a potential hormonal mechanism...|$|E
