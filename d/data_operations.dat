40|$|<b>Data</b> {{parallel}} <b>operations</b> {{are widely}} used in game, multimedia, physics and data-intensive and scientific applications. Unlike control parallelism, data parallelism comes from simultaneous operations across large sets of collection-oriented data such as vectors and matrices. A simple implementation can use OpenMP directives to execute <b>operations</b> on multiple <b>data</b> concurrently. However, this implementation introduces a lot of barriers across <b>data</b> parallel <b>operations</b> and even within a single <b>data</b> parallel <b>operation</b> to synchronize the concurrent threads. This synchronization cost may overwhelm the benefit of data parallelism. Moreover, barriers prohibit many optimization opportunities among parallel regions. In this paper, we describe an approach to optimizing <b>data</b> parallel <b>operations</b> on many-core platforms, called sub-primitive fusion, which reduces expensive barriers by merging code regions of <b>data</b> parallel <b>operations</b> based on the data flow information. It also replaces remaining barriers with light-weight synchronization mechanisms. This approach enables other optimization opportunities such as data reuse across <b>data</b> parallel <b>operations,</b> dynamic partitioning of fused <b>data</b> parallel <b>operations,</b> and semiasynchronous parallel execution among the threads. We present preliminary experimental results for the sparse matrix kernels that demonstrate the benefits of this approach. We observe speedups up to 5 on an 8 -way SMP machine compared against the serial execution time. 1...|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} a model that relaxes most of the above {{constraints}} (except reading others’ write early) is Weak Ordering. It classifies memory operations into two categories: <b>Data</b> <b>operations</b> and Synchronization operations. To enforce program order, a programmer needs to find at least one synchronisation operation in a program. The assumption under which this works is that, reordering memory operations to data regions between synchronisation operations {{does not affect the}} outcome of the program. They just act as the safety net for enforcing program order. The way this works is that a counter tracks the number of <b>data</b> <b>operations</b> and until this counter becomes zero, the synchronisation operation isn’t issued. Furthermore, no more <b>data</b> <b>operations</b> are issued unless all the previous synchronisation’s are completed. Memory operations in between two synchronisation variables can be overlapped and reordered without affecting the correctness of the program. This model ensures that write atomicity is always maintained, therefore no additional safety net is required for Weak Ordering.|$|E
