40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} current legal {{regulation}} of incidence contentions, which {{can occur in}} the enforcement proceedings. The thesis consists of 3 chapters. The introductory chapter of the thesis deals {{with the introduction of}} the basic terminology, historic background, attributes of civil procedure and differences betweenen forcement proceedings and exekutory proceedings. It is essential to bear in mind that for a very purpose of this thesis a term "enforcement proceedings" refers to the civil execution on the one hand, and the enforcement procedure on the other. Among others, folowing disputes have been tackled: disputes about enforcement, exclusive contentions and last, but not least Third-Party Debtor disputes. Disputes which emerge from both types of civil enforcement proceedings are currently not regulated in the Execution Law and must therefore be governed by the rule of Civil Procedure. Principal diferences among certain types of disputes consist in particular in the phase of proceedings in which each dispute <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> addressed. While disputes about <b>enforcement</b> <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> settled in the phase of enforcement proceedings, the others <b>shall</b> then <b>be</b> transfered back in to the phase of adversarial proceedings.

To conduct the {{due process of law}} towards cases related with human trafficking, the law enforcement officers cannot work by themselves. They really need assistance from many parties – such as active report from the society – as a valuable information to disclose such cases. Law enforcement conducted towards woman and child trafficking is still ineffective. It is proven by many existing cases, that low number of processed cases before the court and minimum sanction convicted to the perpetrators is clearly evident. Factors which are deemed to have correlation with low attempt of law enforcement towards legal case on this case, among others are: Lack of the Government 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to fight against the crime of human trafficking, in the event that the ineffectiveness in utilization of prevailing laws and regulation; Lack of capacity of professionalism of law enforcement agency (and relevant parties) in handling women and child trafficking at the field.

The general result of the proceedings of the Government from the accession of George III. {{to the beginning of the}} troubles in the American colonies, was in Burke's own words, that the Government was at once dreaded and contemned; that the laws were despoiled of all their respected and salutary terrors; that their inaction was a subject of ridicule, and their exertion of abhorrence; that our dependencies had slackened in their affections; that we knew neither how to yield, nor how to enforce; and that disconnection and confusion, in offices, in parties, in families, in Parliament, in the nation, prevailed beyond the disorders of any former time.|$|R
