5|$|Alternative views {{have been}} {{expressed}} that the amendments were not seeking {{to replace the}} common law of judicial review. Instead, they borrowed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> law by turning the clock back, and merely clarified the limits of judicial power {{in relation to the}} ISA. It has also been noted that the amendments do not compel the application of Lee Mau Seng, a High Court decision. If Lee Mau Seng is wrong, the Court of Appeal can still overrule it now.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attack was}} made in 1521 by Paulus Bombasius, the prefect of the Vatican Library, because in Greek text Erasmus {{departed}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> readings of the Vulgate. He informed Erasmus that in the Vatican Library is held an extremely ancient copy of the Scriptures (i.e. Codex Vaticanus). He sent two extracts from this manuscript containing 1 John 4:1-3 and 1 John 5:7-11 (it did not include Comma).|$|E
50|$|The House of Lords scrutinises {{bills that}} have been {{approved}} by <b>the</b> House of <b>Commons.</b> It regularly reviews and amends Bills <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons.</b> While it is unable to prevent Bills passing into law, except in certain limited circumstances, it can delay Bills and force <b>the</b> <b>Commons</b> to reconsider their decisions. In this capacity, the House of Lords acts as a check on <b>the</b> House of <b>Commons</b> that is independent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> electoral process. Bills can be introduced into either the House of Lords or <b>the</b> House of <b>Commons.</b> While members of the Lords may also take on roles as government ministers, high-ranking officials such as cabinet ministers are usually drawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons.</b> <b>The</b> House of Lords has its own support services, separate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commons,</b> including <b>the</b> House of Lords Library.|$|R

5|$|Known as {{the castle}} by inmates, the prison had a turreted lodge at the entrance, {{with a side}} room called the pound, where new prisoners would wait until a room was found for them. The front lodge led to a {{courtyard}} known as the park. This had been divided in two by a long narrow wall, so that prisoners <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> side could not be seen by those on the master's side, who preferred not to be distressed {{by the sight of}} abject poverty, especially when they might themselves be plunged into it at any moment.|$|E

5|$|Sclerocitrin, a pigment {{compound}} originally isolated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> earthball (Scleroderma citrinum), is {{the major}} contributor to the yellow colour of the mycelium and the stipe base of C.piperatus fruit bodies. Other compounds that have been isolated from this species include norbadioneA, chalciporone, xerocomic acid, variegatic acid, variegatorubin, and another yellow pigment, chalcitrin. Chalciporone {{is responsible for the}} bitter taste of the fruit bodies. The pigments sclerocitrin, chalcitrin, and norbadioneA are derived biosynthetically from xerocomic acid. Related compounds found in the fruit bodies include the chalciporone isomers isochalciporone and dehydroisochalciporone.|$|E

5|$|The Romanians' ethnogenesis {{cannot be}} {{understood}} based exclusively on written sources, because the earliest records on their ancestors {{were made by}} 11th-century Byzantine historians.

5|$|DNA {{sequencing}} of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes yielded relationships quite different; the three New World pelicans formed one lineage, with the American white pelican sister {{to the two}} brown pelicans, and the five Old World species the other. The Dalmatian, pink-backed and spot-billed were all closely related to one another, while the Australian white pelican was their next-closest relative. The great white pelican also belonged to this lineage but {{was the first to}} diverge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> ancestor of the other four species. This finding suggests that pelicans evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas, and that preference for tree- or ground-nesting is more related to size than genetics.|$|E
5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E

5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance on the common law found in Canon law, {{and there are a number}} of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> law embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.|$|E
5|$|If {{the hostages}} were still {{held by the}} Scots a decade later, they may well have feared for their lives. For in 1275, the {{continuation}} of the twelfth-century Historia rerum Anglicarum, the thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann, and the fourteenth-century Chronicle of Lanercost reveal that Guðrøðr led a revolt on the island against the Scottish Crown. According to the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum, Guðrøðr took possession of the island's strongholds, ejecting the Scottish representatives in the process. Alexander III quickly responded by sending a great fleet, drawn from the Hebrides and Galloway, to invade the island and restore Scottish royal authority. The commanders of this enterprise were: John de Vesci (died 1289), John Comyn I, Lord of Badenoch (died c. 1277), Alan, Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll (died 1310), and Ailéan mac Ruaidhrí (died ×1296). The identities of these men suggest that the Scottish force was composed of a small component of heavily armed knights, a contingent of infantry troops levied <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> army of Galloway, and a fleet of galleys gathered from the Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|In R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, {{ex parte}} Lain (1967), {{it was held}} that {{the powers of the}} Board were in {{principle}} reviewable, despite it having been established under prerogative powers. This case was cited with approval in the GCHQ case, which reflects the modern position on the reviewability of prerogative powers in the United Kingdom. In this case, their Lordships unanimously held that executive action was not immune from judicial review merely because it was carried out in pursuance of a power derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> law (or the prerogative) rather than a statutory source. It was the subject-matter that counted, not the source. In this case, the Government, through an order in council, banned employees of the Government Communications Headquarters from joining a trade union. The House of Lords held that this exercise of the prerogative was judicially reviewable, and the trade unions had a legitimate expectation of prior consultation before the ban was imposed. However, although the failure to consult the unions was unfair, this lapse from proper procedure was overridden by national security considerations and thus not justiciable.|$|E
