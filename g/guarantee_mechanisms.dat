40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{availability}} of sophisticated network quality of service (QoS) <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> it is apparent {{that a large number of}} applications will continue using the best effort service class. The main reason for this is that the QoS <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are complex and many applications are not capable of using these complex services. At the same time, the standard best effort service is rather unpredictable and hence insufficient for many applications. Thus augmenting best effort services to an appropriate standard without incurring a high level of complexity is necessary.

40|$|To {{mitigate}} the regulator losses associated with bank failures, efforts are usually made {{to dispose of}} failed bank assets quickly. However, this process usually precludes due diligence examination by acquiring banks, leading to problems of asymmetric information concerning asset quality. this paper examines two mechanisms {{that have been used}} for dealing with these problems, "put guarantees," under which acquiring banks are allowed to return assets to the regulatory authority for liquidation, and "loss-sharing arrangements," under which the acquiring banks keep all assets under their control to maturity and are then compensated by the regulatory authority for a portion of asset losses. The analysis is conducted in a Hart-Moore framework in which the removal of certain assets from the banking system can reduce their value. Changes in the relative desirability of the two <b>guarantee</b> <b>mechanisms</b> during economic downturns are shown to depend on the credibility of the regulatory authority. When the regulatory authority enjoys credibility, a downturn favors the loss-sharing arrangement, while when the regulatory authority lacks credibility, the impact of a downturn is ambiguous.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{comparative}} study among scheduling algorithms which use different priority as-signments and different <b>guarantee</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to im-prove {{the performance of a}} real-time system during overload conditions. In order to enhance the quality of service, we assume that tasks are characterized not only by a deadline, but also by an importance value. The performance of the scheduling algorithm is then evaluated by computing the cumulative value gained on a task set, i. e. the sum of the values of those tasks that completed by their deadline. The purpose of this simulation study was twofold. Firstly, we wanted to discover which priority assign-ment is able to achieve the best performance in over-loud conditions. Secondly, we were interested in un-derstanding how the pessimistic assumptions made in the guarantee test affect the performance of the scheduling algorithms, and how much a reclaiming mechanism can compensate this degradation. Simulation results show that, without any admis-sion control, value-density scheduling performs best. Simple admission control based on worst case esti-mates of the load worsen the performance of all value based algorithms. EDF scheduling performs best if ad-mission control is used along with a reclaiming mech-anism that takes advantage of early completions. Fi-nally, scheduling by deadline before overload and by value during overload works best in most practical con-ditions. ...|$|E

As applications become increasingly sophisticated and processing power increases, the most serious limitation on these devices is the available battery life. Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) has been a key technique in exploiting the hardware characteristics of processors to reduce energy dissipation by lowering the supply voltage and operating frequency. The DVS algorithms are shown {{to be able to make}} dramatic energy savings while providing the necessary peak computation power in general-purpose systems. However, for a large class of applications in embedded real-time systems like cellular phones and camcorders, the variable operating frequency interferes with their deadline <b>guarantee</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and DVS in this context, despite its growing importance, is largely overlooked/under-developed. To provide real-time guarantees, DVS must consider deadlines and periodicity of real-time tasks, requiring integration with the real-time scheduler. In this paper, we present a class of novel algorithms called real-time DVS (RT-DVS) that modify the OS's real-time scheduler and task management service to provide significant energy savings while maintaining real-time deadline guarantees. We show through simulations and a working prototype implementation that these RT-DVS algorithms closely approach the theoretical lower bound on energy consumption, and can easily reduce energy consumption 20 % to 40 % in an embedded real-time system. 1...|$|E
40|$|Social Impact bonds (SIBs) have {{attracted}} much attention {{in the aftermath of}} the financial crisis. They have been implemented in a number of countries as they seem to be an attractive proposition for financing the delivery of social services. But SIBs remain a fairly new financial instrument aiming at social impact with limited evidence regarding their results. Therefore, further analysis is needed in order to develop a robust evidence base. SIBs are complex instruments. They involve multiple stakeholders coming from different sectors. Time, technical expertise and commitment to collaborate are indispensable in order to establish a SIB. SIBs have been costly instruments so far. They have entailed significant transaction costs that stakeholders should consider before embarking on them. Policy makers should evaluate carefully what is the value added for implementing a SIB for a policy intervention compared to a more traditional approach. However, transaction costs are expected to drop as more SIBs develop and there is a streamlined process for establishing them. Rigorous methodological design for identifying measurable social outcomes and appropriate target groups is of utmost importance in order to avoid perverse effects, such as “creaming”, “parking” or “cherry picking”. SIBs may be an opportunity to nurture a culture of monitoring and evaluation in social service delivery. Independent and robust evaluation could benefit all stakeholders as it may identify what works well in SIBs and what does not as well as unintended consequences, positive or negative. SIBs intend to roll over the risk from the government and the service providers to investors. Yet, capital protection and <b>guarantee</b> <b>mechanisms</b> as well as early termination clauses of the SIB contract may be in place mitigating the risk assumed by investors.  ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{three main}} contributions that aim {{to improve the}} transport layer of the current networking architecture. The transport layer is nowadays dominated {{by the use of}} TCP and its congestion control. Recently new congestion control mechanisms have been proposed. Among them, TCP Friendly Hate Control (TFRC) appears {{to be one of the}} most complete. Nevertheless this congestion control mechanism, as with TCP, does not take into account either the evolution of the network in terms of Quality of Service and mobility or the evolution of the applications. The first contribution of this thesis is a specialisation of TFRC congestion control to provide a QoS-aware Transport Protocol specifically designed to operate over QoS-enabled networks with bandwidth <b>guarantee</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This protocol combines a QoS-aware congestion control, which takes into account network-level bandwidth reservations, with full ordered reliability mechanism to provide a transport service similar to TCP. As a result, we obtain the guaranteed throughput at the application level where TCP fails. This protocol is t he first transport protocol compliant with bandwidth guaranteed networks. At the same time the set of network services expands, new technologies have been proposed and deployed at the physical layer. These new technologies are mainly characterised by communications done without wire constraint and the mobility of the end-systems. Furthermore, these technologies are usually deployed on entities where the CPU power and memory storage are limited. The second contribution of this thesis is therefore to propose an adaptation of TFHC to these entities. This is accomplished with the proposition of a new sender-based version of TFHC. This version has been implemented, evaluated and its numerous contributions and advantages compare to usual TFHC version have been demonstrated. Finally, we proposed an optimisation of actual implementations of TFHC. This optimisation first consists in the proposition of an algorithm based on a numerical analysis of the equation used in TFHC and the use of the Newton's algorithm. We furthermore give a first step, with the introduction of a new framework for TFRC, in order to better understand TFHC behaviour and to optimise the computation of the packet loss rate according to loss probability distributions...|$|E

The main research objective of this report was to compare innovation policy across selected European and Pacific Rim countries in order to assess how best to optimise innovation policy in New Zealand. Two assessments of National Systems of Innovation (NIS) policies settings were made, each using a different framework of analysis for the selected case study countries (20 and 21 cases respectively). The sample included selected European and Asian countries, Australia and New Zealand. From the European experts assessments, results from comparing New Zealand with the European Innovation Leaders shows that there is potential to improve NIS in New Zealand by giving attention to: • Innovation policy strategic intelligence: strategic exercises, advisory bodies, foresights, evaluations, peer reviews, benchmarking, NIS studies capacity building within agencies in charge of policy design and implementation. • Public private partnerships and knowledge transfer: via competence centres and joint public-private organisation oriented towards innovation, clusters, networks and poles with businesses as main drivers the provision of science parks and incubators providing knowledge transfer incentives such as science-industry bridging organisations, university transfer offices, cooperative programmes, funding schemes, and research commercialisation schemes.

40|$|This thesis frames {{design in}} {{infrastructure}} public-private partnerships (P 3 s) {{as an exercise}} in negotiated collaboration. I investigate whether the collaborative design process in P 3 s can systematically deliver the benefits of innovation in design. The focus is on two aspects of the design process: project co-design, and collaboration mechanism. I find that both aspects enable innovation by driving project actors {{to learn about the}} design space and develop a shared understanding of the design problem. Learning through shared understanding not only improves quantifiable payoffs (Objective Value) but also enhances the actors' psycho-social outcomes (Subjective Value). Co-design is a process in which project actors simultaneously design technical and contractual features of a project. I developed a tradespace model to visualize and explore value trade-offs from co-design, using a desalination P 3 as a project case. Co-design is a fundamental improvement over the traditional sequential design process because it reveals the zone of negotiated agreement, a frontier set of designs available to project actors, that can help them meet their own objectives while balancing value trade-offs. The combination of flexible modular designs and risk sharing revenue <b>guarantee</b> <b>mechanisms</b> emerged as a frontier design choice in the co-design analysis. Communication and common knowledge are two different collaboration mechanisms that affect the design choices of project actors. A controlled design experiment with 112 experienced designers tested the relative effects of these two mechanisms. The role-playing designers negotiated design decisions for a desalination P 3 using the co-design tradespace model. Only the communication mechanism systematically shifted outcomes. To increase the reliability of meeting uncertain water demand, the firm traded away an expected net present value profit share of 24 % (p< 0. 001) on average, subject to the parameter assumptions. The water authority increased contractual payments by an expected net present value share of 6. 6 % (p< 0. 001) on average. Final designs in the exercise were on average 97. 5 % reliable in meeting uncertain water demand. Communication dominated common knowledge as a collaboration mechanism because it enabled participants to learn about the effects of modularity and revenue guarantees on counter-party outcomes and use these design features to negotiate value trade-offs. Objective Value represents the technical (reliability) and economic (profits, payments) payoffs to project participants. Subjective Value on the other hand captures social psychological outcomes such as the degree of trust and rapport between collaborators and perceived fairness and legitimacy of the process, which are important for the partnering relationship. Participants in the collaboration experiment overwhelmingly reported high Subjective Value scores, which are positively correlated with both their improved understanding of the project's design objectives (r = 0. 37, p = 0. 41, p< 0. 001) and their ability to communicate with collaborators to agree on design choices (r = 0. 36, p = 0. 36, p = 0. 001). This work directly addresses the literature on infrastructure public-private partnerships and shows how negotiated collaboration can create objective as well as psychosocial benefits for a stronger partnering relationship. The co-design approach speaks to the literature on systems design to emphasize how a systems view can help designers balance trade-offs. The experimental study is a methodological contribution to both the design and negotiations literature, applying the Subjective Value framework in an integrated design setting. by Vivek A.

40|$|Providing {{contractual}} performance assurances in {{distributed systems}} {{is an important}} and challenging problem. From the users perspective, stringent performance requirements are becoming more critical, which increases the need for predictability. Meanwhile, from the system engineers perspective, distributed systems are driven towards an increasingly larger scale, more integration and higher complexity, making predictable system performance more difficult to achieve. In this dissertation, we reconcile the above conflicting trends {{in the context of}} achieving temporal predictability in distributed server systems. Predictable timing behavior is becoming increasingly important in wide-area networks. It is expected that a predominant majority of Internet clients in the next decade will become embedded devices. As web-based systems are used in progressively more interactive or critical applications that live under the constraints of the physical world in real-time, renewed interest in timing properties is warranted. In fact, projects such as GENI, already promise nation-scale testbeds for a cleanslate Internet re-design. One of the major thrusts fueling the need for such a new design lies in the vision of Internet use in the context of safety-critical applications with real-time constraints. Since GENI and the clean-slate Internet is not yet available, we implement our framework for temporal predictability within the constraints of the current network. To separate out application-independent components, we break the predictability problem into one of generic real-time content distribution services and application-specific time-sensitive end-systems. Our approach to providing timing predictability is two-fold. First, we investigate proactive mechanisms for ensuring end-to-end timing guarantees in wide-area content distribution systems executing across the current Internet. Second, we investigate reactive mechanisms that diagnose timing violations. In contrast to much prior research on QoS which addressed the problem of restoring proper timing behavior on end-systems assuming correctness of their software implementation, the increased scale of modern distributed systems generates a need for addressing the possibility of software errors or misconfiguration that cause timing violations. Hence, {{when it comes to the}} (software-intensive) end-system, our work is directed at self-diagnosis of timing violations rather than on traditional quality of service architectures, which abound in prior work. Our solution to the first problem above (that of ensuring end-to-end timing guarantees in content distribution systems) involves a decentralized replication scheme that dynamically selects subsets of the content distribution servers for different classes of content so that per-class network latency bounds are achieved. The replication decisions are made autonomously by the servers based on dynamically measured network latencies and workload conditions. The content replication proceeds in a way that balances workload among servers, hence fully utilizing system capacity and avoiding latency bound violations. The efficiency and decentralized nature of the replication scheme enables our solution to scale up to very large content distribution networks. Solutions to the second problem (namely, the self-diagnosing capability of end-systems) come from scalable learning-based performance problem diagnosis techniques we propose. The increasing complexity of systems has motivated design of machine learning approaches to automate some system management tasks. However, with increase in scale, current approaches suffer from serious scalability issues. We present two scalable learning-based techniques that automatically identify probable causes of timing violations in large server systems with multiple tiers and replicated sites. By incorporating more diagnostic information sources using a temporal segmentation mechanism and applying transfer learning techniques, we achieve both scalability and improved diagnosis accuracy. The service is implemented and deployed on PlanetLab, a realistic wide-area network platform. Our evaluation results of proactive delay <b>guarantee</b> <b>mechanisms</b> demonstrate that subsecond delay bounds can be guaranteed with a very high probability with very limited or even imperfect global knowledge. In addition, we evaluate our reactive mechanisms for automated performance problem diagnosis against three months of production traces from a real-world distributed application. Experimental results verify the efficacy of our approach: both diagnosis accuracy and scalability are significantly enhanced compared to base-line solutions. The combination of our proactive and reactive time management mechanisms provides opportunity for building services that manipulate real-time content in wide-area networks...|$|E

40|$|This work {{describes}} the self-calibration of a high-precision open-loop mechanism. The self-calibration method {{is applied to}} a mechanical shutter for space applications, which was launched onboard the ESA-ROSETTA mission (launch: 2 March 2004). It {{is based on an}} adaptive ‘model reference’ and a ‘randomised’ search method which may be generalised to applications in which high performance and functionality are strongly interconnected. The method makes use of an adaptive ‘model-reference’ control approach [K. J. Astrom, B. Wittenmark, On self-tuning regulators Automatica 9 (1973) 185 – 199 [16]; K. J. Astrom, Theory and application of adaptive control, in: Proceedings of the Eighth IFAC World Conference, Kyoto, Japan, 1981 [17]; D. E. Seborg, S. L. Shah, T. F. Edgar, Adaptive control strategies for process control, AIChE Journal 6 (32) (1986) 881 – 895 [18]] to <b>guarantee</b> <b>mechanism</b> performance. The proposed control system comprises both a deterministic adaptive part and a random-search one [K. L. Clarkson, Applications of random sampling in computational geometry, II, in: Proceedings of the Fourth Annual ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry, 1998, pp. 1 – 11 [19]; P. K. Agarwal, M.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} Japanese {{experience}} with "put guarantees" recently {{offered in the}} sale of several failed banks. These guarantees, meant to address information asymmetry problems, are shown to create moral hazard problems of their own. In particular, the guarantees make acquiring banks reluctant to accept first-best renegotiations with problem borrowers. These issues also arose in the U. S. savings and loan crisis. Regulators in that crisis turned to an alternative <b>guarantee</b> <b>mechanism</b> known as "loss-sharing arrangements" with apparently positive results. I introduce a formal debt model to examine the conditions determining the relative merits of these guarantees. The results show that both forms of guarantees reduce expected regulator revenues and that the impact of economic downturns on the relative desirability of the two guarantees is ambiguous.
