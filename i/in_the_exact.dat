5|$|S.e.caesia, {{the most}} {{widespread}} of the western subspecies, has orange-buff underparts except for a white throat and cheeks. The other western forms mainly differ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> shade of the underparts, although some southeastern forms also show a white forehead and supercilium. S.e.sinensis and S.e.formosana, of China and Taiwan respectively, have buff underparts like the western races, but have buff, instead of white, throats.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{the video}} artist Eve Sussman filmed 89 Seconds at Alcázar, a high-definition video tableau {{inspired}} by Las Meninas. The {{work is a}} recreation of the moments leading up to and directly following the approximately 89 seconds when the royal family and their courtiers would have come together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> configuration of Velázquez's painting. Sussman had assembled a team of 35, including an architect, a set designer, a choreographer, a costume designer, actors, actresses, and a film crew.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2009 NHL Entry Draft, Schenn {{had been}} listed as the third highest {{prospect}} among WHL players in the NHL Central Scouting Service (CSS)'s preliminary rankings, while International Scouting (ISS) ranked him at fifth overall and first in the WHL. Schenn's ranking remained the same at fifth overall with the NHL CSS's midway ranking. E. J. McGuire, the director of NHL's Central Scouting Bureau compared facets of Schenn's game to Jonathan Cheechoo and Joe Thornton. At the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, he managed to be drafted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> same amateur selection position his brother Luke had two years earlier, as he was drafted fifth overall by the Los Angeles Kings.|$|E

5|$|Mike {{continues}} to blast the shark with the impulses, {{causing it to}} leap {{out of the water}} again, igniting the bomb as Ellen steers the sailboat towards the shark while thinking back to Sean's demise, the shark's attack on Thea, and when her husband killed the first shark. The broken bowsprit impales the shark <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> spot where the bomb is, causing it to explode on impact. The shark's corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of the}} sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|E
5|$|The {{back wall}} of the room, which is in shadow, is hung with rows of paintings, {{including}} {{one of a series of}} scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses by Peter Paul Rubens, and copies, by Velázquez's son-in-law and principal assistant Juan del Mazo, of works by Jacob Jordaens. The paintings are shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> positions recorded in an inventory taken around this time. The wall to the right is hung with a grid of eight smaller paintings, visible mainly as frames owing to their angle from the viewer. They can be identified from the inventory as more Mazo copies of paintings from the Rubens Ovid series, though only two of the subjects can be seen.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebral}} {{region of}} the brain is separated {{from the rest of}} the brain by a distinct compression caused in the endocranial cavity. The rearmost part of the cerebral {{region of the}} braincase has a top with a small expansion. This is different from Jainosaurus. However, relatively much larger expansions are known in the diplodocoid sauropods Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus. In MCCM-HUE-8741, the small opening in the skull roof middle is responsible for a swelling on the endocast that is suggestive of a pineal system. It is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> position where the pineal gland is expected to have been, between the forebrain and the midbrain.|$|E

5|$|The {{events of}} the conquest are narrated by two sources, the various {{versions}} of the Chronicle of the Morea, and On the Conquest of Constantinople, by the Crusader Geoffrey of Villehardouin (uncle of Geoffrey I). According to the Chronicle, the Franks had between 700 men, while the Greeks had 4,000, mounted and on foot. The elder Villehardouin states that the army of Michael (who is not mentioned by the Chronicle) numbered 5,000 men {{and that of the}} Franks 500. The two sources also differ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> chronology of events, with the Chronicle placing the battle after the Frankish capture of Kalamata, and the elder Villehardouin after the seizure of Modon. In any case, despite being outnumbered, the Franks, after a march of a single day, confronted the Greeks and won the battle, no details for which are given.|$|E

Kaminaljuyu has the greatest concentration of potbelly sculptures in any site, with several of them found concentrated in the Palangana monument plaza.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers sought {{inspiration}} from novels such as Prime Directive, Spock's World and Best Destiny {{to fill in}} gaps unexplained by canon; Best Destiny particularly explores Kirk's childhood and names his parents. One idea that was justified through information from the novels was having Enterprise built on Earth, which {{was inspired by a}} piece of fan art of Enterprise being built in a shipyard. Orci had sent the fan art to Abrams to show how realistic the film could be. Orci explained parts of the ship would have to be constructed on Earth because of the artificial gravity employed on the ship and its requirement for sustaining warp speed, and therefore the calibration of the ship's machinery would be best done <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> gravity well which is to be simulated. They felt free to have the ship built in Iowa because canon is ambiguous as to whether it was built in San Francisco, but this {{is a result of the}} time travel rather than something intended to overlap with the original timeline. Abrams noted the continuity of the original series itself was inconsistent at times.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1935 Pais began his studies at the University of Amsterdam without a clear idea {{regarding}} his desired career. With an interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> sciences, he gradually gravitated to chemistry and physics as major subjects, and mathematics and astronomy as minor subjects. In the winter of 1936/1937 his career goals were defined by two guest lectures by George Uhlenbeck, professor of theoretical physics at University of Utrecht. Pais was fascinated by Uhlenbeck's discussion of Enrico Fermi's incorporation of the neutrino into the theory of beta radiation.|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} of Croatian ethnogenesis {{begins with the}} {{definition of}} ethnicity, according to which an ethnic group is a socially defined category of people who identify with each other based on common ancestral, social, cultural or other experience, and which shows a certain durability over the long period term of time. In the Croatian case, there's no doubt that in the Early Middle Ages a certain group identified themselves by ethnonym Hrvati (Croats), and was identified as such by the others. It also had a political connotation, it continued to expand, and since the Late Middle Ages explicitly identified with the nation, although not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> meaning as of the contemporary modern nation.|$|E
