500|$|Due to {{his poor}} eyesight, Berry wore contact lenses when he played. Because the lenses would often slip {{when he did}} rapid eye {{movements}} toward the ball, he tried many different lenses, which led sportswriters to believe {{he must have had}} major eye problems. [...] "I tried all kinds of lenses till we got what we wanted," [...] he said. [...] "I even had tinted lenses for sunny days, so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> the ball come right across the sun." ...|$|E
500|$|Melinda Newman of HitFix {{positively}} {{received the}} video, stating [...] "its success lies solely in the charisma and believability that the trio {{brings to the}} small screen, which is considerable." [...] A writer for BET Sound Off called the video a [...] "tantalizing visual" [...] and said he adored it, commenting, [...] "sans Kanye and Neyo’s unbearable showdown, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> this video {{over and over and}} over and over!" [...] Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "Though their scenes together are G-rated in comparison to Ciara's steamy romp with Justin Timberlake in their new clip for 'Love Sex Magic,' Hilson’s solo shots in bed are undeniably hot. Indeed, a tasteful flash of booty never hurt nobody." [...] In an interview on the Today Show, anchor Hoda Kotb made a remark to Ne-Yo, stating, [...] "You have this really hot new video that you do with Kanye West and another woman named Keri. You [...] are such big stars. How did this happen?" [...] Blogs reported this as a possible [...] "diss" [...] toward Hilson, however, neither camps reported anything after the fact.|$|E
500|$|The {{first part}} of the finale {{received}} critical acclaim. Ramsey Isler of IGN thought it [...] "fantastic," [...] because it was [...] "a great story that leads us into one hell of a conclusion to the season," [...] and that it [...] "right away [...] us the deepest, most exciting look into the alternate universe we've seen so far." [...] He rated it 9.0/10. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly and MTV's Josh Wigler agreed on this last point, with Tucker noting the first part [...] "was a complete success and a blast at giving us a fully lived-in alternate universe." [...] Noel Murray of The Onions The A.V. Club graded the first part with an A−, calling it [...] "a fun, exciting episode that nicely set up next week's finale". Isler, Wigler, and Murray loved the return of the Cortexifan subjects; Murray docked the episode a half point, explaining [...] "I love the idea of Olivia & The Cortexifanatics so much that I'm bummed Fringe burned through the group so quickly." [...] Critic Andrew Hanson, writing for the Los Angeles Times, noted that because of the parallel universe focus, the first part felt like the following season's premiere. He praised the opening scene, and believed the scenes between Peter and his mother helped [...] "ground the episode. They might be out of pace with the action and drama pouring out of every other moment, but there was weight and emotion. Bravo Joshua Jackson and Orla Brady. Bravo." [...] Ken Tucker noted that the scenes with Peter and his true mother indicated [...] "a great, humantistic use of a sci-fi trope". MTV's Josh Wigler praised Torv's performance, but wished the two-part finale was not broken up, explaining [...] "I could have easily tuned in for another several hours. Heck, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> an entire parallel series focused solely on the alternate universe!" ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{he won the}} NIT-NACDA Athletic Directors Award, {{he said in his}} speech: [...] "I {{have always}} been a great believer in sports as part of our American way of living[...] [...] [...] [...] I am {{reminded}} of an experience I had of 40 years ago which brought home the real sudden realization of how important we are, and {{how important it is to}} have sports in our American way of life. I mentioned 40 years ago, that would bring us back to March of 1946. At that time I was involved in some high school work in Toledo, Ohio, as a football and a basketball coach. But in order to augment my income, because we weren't getting paid a great deal in those days, I was doing some officiating. I was very fortunate to be chosen by the Big Ten Conference to work the Final Four of the NCAA, which in that year was held in Madison Square Garden. I went a day or two early so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> the finals of the NIT Tournament. The two teams were Utah and Kentucky. On the Utah team was a little Japanese-American boy by the name of Walter Misaka. On the Kentucky team was a great basketball player, number one in the country, by the name of Ralph Beard. Misaka was about 5'10" [...] and probably weighed around 160 pounds. Beard was about 6'2" [...] or 6'3" [...] and weighed about 190 He was called 'Mr. Everything' in basketball. Nobody had ever heard of Walter, but in the man to man defense that the Utah coach, Peterson, used against Kentucky that night, Misaka was chosen to guard Ralph Beard. He held Ralph Beard to 3 points, one basket and one free throw, and as a result of the great work that this little guy did on Ralph Beard, and of course, the work of his teammates, Utah won the game and won the National Invitation Tournament Championship. Just before the end of the ballgame, with just about a minute to play, the Utah coach took Misaka out of the game. About 14,000 people in the Garden that night rose to a person and stood on their feet and cheered the great effort turned out by the little Japanese-American boy. As I reflected on it later, I thought what a great display of how sports are in the American way of life. Remember, I mentioned the date was March, 1946. We had just finished a war with Japan. There were people in the audience who had lost loved ones in the Japanese conflict. There wasn't much love in the heart of any of those people or any American for that matter, for anyone of Japanese ancestry. Yet they could cast aside all of their dislike for the Japanese race and stand on their feet at a sports contest and cheer the efforts of a little Japanese-American boy. Since that time I realize how great our sports program is in America, and how much it means to the American way of life." ...|$|E

6000|$|I don't {{know what}} the others were doing; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>watch</b> them: they asked me {{questions}} I did not answer; they ransacked all corners; they prattled about this and that disarrangement of cloaks, a breach or crack in the sky-light--I know not what.

60|$|I {{perceived}} {{that she was}} not listening.

60|$|One day, on a dull, drowsy afternoon, the dream-child called.

60|$|Nevertheless, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> {{the others}} {{with a strange}} and almost impersonal curiosity--the group of men {{standing}} with hard hands on the rifle barrels ready for a rush; the grim figure of the sergeant, and the young corporal poised with head held high, left foot flung forward, and carbine at hip, in front of them.|$|E
6000|$|They sat {{them down}} {{on either side of}} the {{smouldering}} fire and stared at each other through the thin smoke there in the gloom of the hut.

60|$|I swung noiselessly {{out into}} the lake, where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> the alders.

60|$|However, I bore up cheerfully.

60|$|The priest {{stood still}} {{with his hands}} erect. The four others, in pairs on either side, bowed down their faces in awe to the ground.

The priest lifted up his voice aloud. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> catch not one word or syllable of what he said, but I was dimly aware in my intervals of pain that he was chanting some sort of measured savage litany. Every now and again he paused a moment, and then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear that his four companions answered him back in a solemn but loud response, in which I frequently fancied I caught the name of Pélé.|$|R
60|$|A mass of rock {{would soon}} hide them from my view; but so keen was the {{excitement}} of the instant that I could not refrain from crawling forward to a point whence <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> the dashing of the small craft to pieces on the jagged rocks that loomed before her, al-though I risked discovery from above to accomplish my design.|$|E

5000|$|Series five was {{broadcast}} in 1990.

60|$|A {{mile away}} along the rocks, I turned for shelter into a {{cavernous}} {{passage of the}} overhanging cliff, where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> still <b>watch</b> the coming storm upon the sea. A murmur of voices presently attracted my attention. I then observed that the passage ended {{in a kind of}} open grotto, where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> dimly discern the little figures of several children, who, separated from their nurses in the sudden onset of the storm, had taken refuge there. As the gloom deepened they became silent again, until the stillness was broken by a familiar voice. There was no mistaking it.--It was Sarah Walker's. But it was not lifted in lamentation, it was raised only as if resuming a suspended narrative.|$|R
60|$|From my seat near {{a window}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>watch</b> him go, as with {{measured}} steps he passed {{up the hill}} which rises behind the State House, {{and disappeared into the}} shadow of the forest. Then my work claimed me, for I wished to record the proceedings so far whilst all was fresh in my mind. In silence, as of the dead, the Council waited, no man challenging opinion of his neighbour even by a glance.|$|E
60|$|The {{conversation}} rippled on. Politics, the sea, amusements, religion, {{each was}} in turn discussed. I remained a silent though an interested listener. It {{struck me that}} no harm could be done by introducing the subject which was ever in my mind. It could be managed in an off-hand way, and would at least {{have the effect of}} turning the Captain's thoughts in that direction. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>watch,</b> too, what effect it would have upon the faces of the conspirators.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I had,--till I knew myself. Mamma, I {{could wait}} for years, {{if he were}} {{contented}} to wait by my side.

I {{do not want to}} have him kneeling to me, and making sweet speeches; but it has gone too far now,--and I could not bear to lose him." [...] And thus to her mother she confessed the truth.|$|E
60|$|The {{early part}} of that night's {{experience}} {{was made up of}} warmth, of moonlit Surrey and Sussex landscape, and of a rapid and successful flight, ascending and swooping, and then ascending again southward. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>watch</b> the clouds because the airship overhung me; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not see the stars nor gauge the meteorological happening, but it was fairly clear to me that a wind shifting between north and northeast was gathering strength, and after I had satisfied myself by a series of entirely successful expansions and contractions of the real air-worthiness of Lord Roberts B, I stopped the engine to save my petrol, and let the monster drift, checking its progress by the dim landscape below. My uncle lay quite still behind me, saying little and staring in front of him, and I was left to my own thoughts and sensations.|$|R
60|$|We crossed it in safety. On {{the other}} side {{extended}} a long flat of upheaved crusts of salt and mud, full of holes and pitfalls, an exceedingly toilsome and painful place to travel, and for all we could tell, dangerous too. I had all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to <b>watch</b> my feet and find surfaces to hold my steps. Eventually we crossed this broken field, reaching {{the edge of the}} gravel slope, where we were very glad indeed to rest.|$|R
60|$|I {{crept into}} the room adjoining--it had been Simbri's--and laid me down upon his bed, but to sleep I was not able. Its door was open, and {{in the light of}} the burning city that shone through the casements <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see Ayesha <b>watching</b> by her dead. Hour after hour she watched, her head resting on her hand, silent, stirless. She wept not, no sigh escaped her; only watched as a tender woman watches a slumbering babe that she knows will awake at dawn.|$|R
