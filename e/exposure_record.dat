40|$|Radiation {{measurements}} {{obtained on}} board U. S. and Soviet spacecraft are presented and discussed. A {{considerable amount of}} data has now been collected and analyzed from measurements {{with a variety of}} detector types in low-Earth orbit. The objectives of these measurements have been to investigate the dose and Linear Energy Transfer (LET) spectra within the complex shielding of large spacecraft. The shielding modifies the external radiation (trapped protons, electrons, cosmic ray nuclei) which, in turn, is quite dependent on orbital parameters (altitude, inclination). For manned flights, these measurements provide a crew <b>exposure</b> <b>record</b> and a data base for future spacecraft design and flight planning. For the scientific community they provide useful information for planning and analyzing data from experiments with high sensitivity to radiation. In this paper, results of measurements by both passive and active detectors are described.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the (epi) genetic makeup of an individual and his/her environmental <b>exposure</b> <b>record</b> (exposome) is accepted as a determinant factor for {{a significant proportion of}} human malignancies. Recent evidence has highlighted the key role of epigenetic mechanisms in mediating gene-environment interactions and translating exposures into tumorigenesis. There is also growing evidence that epigenetic changes may be risk factor-specific ("fingerprints") that should prove instrumental in the discovery of new biomarkers in cancer. Here, we review the state of the science of epigenetics associated with environmental stimuli and cancer risk, highlighting key developments in the field. Critical knowledge gaps and research needs are discussed and advances in epigenomics that may help in understanding the functional relevance of epigenetic alterations. Key elements required for causality inferences linking epigenetic changes to exposure and cancer are discussed and how these alterations can be incorporated in carcinogen evaluation and in understanding mechanisms underlying epigenome deregulation by the environment...|$|E
40|$|Exposure {{to natural}} sunlight, {{specifically}} solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation contributes to lifetime risks of skin cancer, eye disease, and diseases associated with vitamin D insufficiency. Improved knowledge of personal sun exposure patterns can inform public health policy; and help target high-risk population groups. Subsequently, an extensive {{number of studies}} have been conducted to measure personal solar UV exposure in a variety of settings. Many of these studies, however, use digital or paper-based journals (self-reported volunteer recall), or employ cost prohibitive electronic UV dosimeters (that limit the size of sample populations), to estimate periods of exposure. A cost effective personal electronic sun journal (ESJ) built from readily available infrared photodiodes is presented in this research. The ESJ can be used to complement traditional UV dosimeters that measure total biologically effective exposure by providing a time-stamped sun <b>exposure</b> <b>record.</b> The ESJ can be easily attached to clothing and data logged to personal devices (including fitness monitors or smartphones). The ESJ improves upon self-reported exposure recording and is a cost effective high-temporal resolution option for monitoring personal sun exposure behavior in large population studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Globally, {{there is}} a growing concern over {{pesticides}} use, which has been linked to self-harm and suicide. However, there is paucity of research on the epidemiology of pesticides poisoning in Nepal. This study is aimed at assessing epidemiological features of pesticides poisoning among hospital-admitted cases in selected hospitals of Chitwan District of Nepal. Methods A hospital-based quantitative study was carried out in four major hospitals of Chitwan District. Information on all pesticides poisoning cases between April 1 and December 31, 2015, was recorded by using a Pesticides <b>Exposure</b> <b>Record</b> (PER) form. Results A total of 439 acute pesticides poisoning cases from 12 districts including Chitwan and adjoining districts attended the hospitals during the 9 -month-long study period. A majority of the poisoned subjects deliberately used pesticides (89. 5 %) for attempted suicide. The total incidence rate was 62. 67 / 100000 population per year. Higher annual incidence rates were found among young adults (111. 66 / 100000 population), women (77. 53 / 100000 population) and individuals from Dalit ethnic groups (98. 22 / 100000 population). Pesticides responsible for poisoning were mostly insecticides (58. 0 %) and rodenticides (20. 8 %). The most used chemicals were organophosphates (37. 3 %) and pyrethroids (36. 7 %). Of the total cases, 98. 6 % were hospitalized, with intensive care required for 41. 3 %. The case fatality rate among admitted cases was 3. 8 %. Conclusions This study has indicated that young adults, females and socially disadvantaged ethnic groups are at a higher risk of pesticides poisoning. Pesticides are mostly misused intentionally as an easy means for committing suicide. It is recommended that the supply of pesticides be properly regulated to prevent easy accessibility and misuse. A population-based study is warranted to reveal the actual problem of pesticides exposure and intoxication in the community...|$|E

40|$|A three {{dimensional}} {{computer model}} of the human face has been developed to represent solar ultraviolet <b>exposures</b> <b>recorded</b> by dosimeter measurements on a manikin headform under low cloud conditions and various solar zenith angles. Additionally, polysulphone dosimeters have been successfully miniaturised to provide the detailed measurements required across the face. The headform used in this research was scanned at 709 individual locations to make a wireframe mesh consisting of 18 vertical contours and 49 horizontal contours covering half the manikin’s frontal facial topography. Additionally, {{the back of the}} headform and neck have also been scaned at 576 locations.

A series of <b>exposures</b> <b>recorded</b> by dosimeters have been translated into three dimensional exposure ratio maps, representing ambient solar ultraviolet exposure. High dosimeter density has allowed for the development of individual topographic contour models which take into account complex variation in the face and improve upon previously employed techniques which utilise fewer dosimeters to interpolate exposure across facial contours.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) is {{an emerging}} animal welfare {{and public health}} issue linked to antimicrobial use (AMU) in livestock. This {{study was conducted in}} 2004 on 20 swine farms in Alberta and Saskatchewan. On-farm records and questionnaires were used to retrospectively describe the antimicrobial exposures of pigs through feed, water, and injection. Antimicrobial use in all production categories was described over 12 months. On-farm records and questionnaires provided sufficient data to describe antimicrobial exposure rates through feed and water. In contrast, on-farm records did not supply sufficient data to describe parenteral antimicrobial <b>exposure</b> rates. <b>Records</b> lacked data on the number of exposures per treatment, therefore parenteral AMU was described as an exposure incidence. Parenteral <b>exposure</b> <b>records</b> were often unavailable for pigs less than 22 kg, in which case questionnaires were used. The incidence of parenteral AMU was significantly higher in herds reporting exposure by questionnaire compared with existing records, suggesting that on-farm records did not reliably describe parenteral AMU. However, because antimicrobial exposures in feed and water were markedly more common than through injection, it was concluded that existing on-farm data would be a valuable resource for investigating AMU and AMR in pigs...|$|R
