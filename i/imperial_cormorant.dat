40|$|The <b>Imperial</b> <b>Cormorant</b> Phalacrocorax atriceps is an inshore foraging, diving seabird (Cooper 1985) {{distributed}} throughout the southern hemisphere south of 45 °S (Watson 1975). A {{brief description of the}} diet of the <b>Imperial</b> <b>Cormorant</b> at Marion Island has been published (Blankley 1981). We present here a more comprehensive report based on food samples collected throughout the year...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} few years, the {{development}} of animal-borne still cameras and video recorders has enabled researchers to observe what a wild animal sees in the field. In the present study, we deployed miniaturized video recorders to investigate the underwater foraging behavior of <b>Imperial</b> <b>cormorants</b> (Phalacrocorax atriceps). Video footage was obtained from 12 animals and 49 dives comprising a total of 8. 1 h of foraging data. Video information revealed that <b>Imperial</b> <b>cormorants</b> are almost exclusively benthic feeders. While foraging along the seafloor, animals did not necessarily keep their body horizontal but inclined it downwards. The head of the instrumented animal was always visible in the videos and {{in the majority of}} the dives it was moved constantly forward and backward by extending and contracting the neck while travelling on the seafloor. Animals detected prey at very short distances, performed quick capture attempts and spent the majority of their time on the seafloor searching for prey. Cormorants foraged at three different sea bottom habitats {{and the way in which}} they searched for food differed between habitats. Dives were frequently performed under low luminosity levels suggesting that cormorants would locate prey with other sensory systems in addition to sight. Our video data support the idea that Imperial cormorants' efficient hunting involves the use of specialized foraging techniques to compensate for their poor underwater vision...|$|R
40|$|We studied discard use and {{incidental}} {{mortality of}} seabirds attracted to high-sea trawl vessels {{operating in the}} Golfo San Jorge, Argentina, {{during the height of}} the fishing season in 2003 and 2004. Fourteen seabird species ate food made available by fishing operations. The most frequent and abundant seabirds (percent occurrence, mean number per haul) were the kelp gull Larus dominicanus (98. 9 %, 207. 0), the black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophrys (98. 9 %, 94. 2) and the white-chinned petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis (91 %, 8. 4). Flock sizes for the 3 species var- ied from a few to a maximum of 1600 birds. Total seabird abundance varied significantly between stages of the fishing operation, being higher during discarding and haulback than during towing. Incidental capture of seabirds in nets was recorded in 37 % of 89 hauls, with a mean capture rate of 1. 2 birds per haul. Species incidentally caught were the great shearwater Puffinus gravis, the imper- ial cormorant Phalacrocorax atriceps and the Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus, with rates that varied between months and years. Considering the fishery’s fishing effort, the estimated total numbers of birds killed during the study were 2254 great shearwaters (CV = 1. 1), 1233 <b>imperial</b> <b>cormorants</b> (CV = 1. 1) and 35 Magellanic penguins (CV = 2. 4) in 2003, and 311 <b>imperial</b> <b>cormorants</b> (CV = 1. 7) and 1516 Magellanic penguins (CV = 1. 1) in 2004. Black-browed albatrosses and kelp gulls were also struck by the warp cable while feeding on discards from the surface, and drowned when they were dragged underwater. The results obtained in this study show that the hake trawl fishery operating in the Golfo San Jorge may have a significant effect on some seabird populations through the provision of fishing discards and incidental mortality.

40|$|Guanay {{cormorants}} Phalacrocorax bougainvilli {{are distributed}} {{mostly on the}} Pacific coast of Peru and northern Chile. A small population of around 50 pairs was described on the Patagonian Atlantic coast in the late 1960 s. Further records have revealed a progressive decrease of this population. During 1999 we looked for guanay cormorants at those Atlantic colonies where the species was recorded in the past. Only four individuals were detected in one colony (Punta Lobería), {{and all of them}} were mated with king cormorants P. albiventer. In addition, we recorded hybrids between guanay and king cormorants mated with pure king and <b>imperial</b> <b>cormorants</b> P. atriceps. Causes of the population decline are unknown. Since guanay cormorants inhabiting the Atlantic coast could be a genetically differentiated population, we emphasize the need for molecular studies. If genetic polymorphism is detected, the capture of remnant individuals in order to constitute a genetic stock should be considered. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{management}} {{during the}} breeding season {{is crucial for}} central place foragers since parents need to feed themselves and their offspring while being spatially and temporally constrained. In this work, we used overall dynamic body acceleration {{as a measure of}} activity and also to allude to the foraging energy expenditure of breeding <b>Imperial</b> <b>cormorants</b> Phalacrocorax atriceps. We also analyzed how changes in the time or energy allocated to different activities affected the foraging trip energy expenditure and estimated the daily food requirements of the species. Birds spent 42 % of the total energy flying to and from the feeding areas and 16 % floating at sea. The level of activity underwater was almost 1. 5 times higher for females than for males. The most expensive diving phase in terms of rate of energy expenditure was descending though the water column. The total foraging trip energy expenditure was particularly sensitive to variation in {{the amount of time spent}} flying. During the breeding season, adult cormorants breeding along the Patagonian coast would consume approximately 10, 000 tons of food. Fil: Gómez Laich, Agustina Marta.
