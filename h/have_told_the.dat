25|$|In this example, simple logic tells {{that there}} is a difference: while the first {{statement}} may be true, it does not assert anything about {{the truth of the matter}} stated. The witness may <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> officer that the truck was blue, but that may not have been the truth; he might have been mistaken or lying.|$|E
25|$|Exxon {{recovered}} {{a significant portion}} of clean-up and legal expenses through insurance claims associated with the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. Also, in 1991, Exxon made a quiet, separate financial settlement of damages with a group of seafood producers known as the Seattle Seven for the disaster's effect on the Alaskan seafood industry. The agreement granted $63.75million to the Seattle Seven, but stipulated that the seafood companies would have to repay almost all of any punitive damages awarded in other civil proceedings. The $5billion in punitive damages was awarded later, and the Seattle Seven's share could have been as high as $750million if the damages award had held. Other plaintiffs have objected to this secret arrangement, and when it came to light, Judge Holland ruled that Exxon should <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> jury at the start that an agreement had already been made, so the jury would know exactly how much Exxon would have to pay.|$|E

500|$|In late 1898 Karim's {{purchase}} of a parcel of land adjacent to his earlier grant was finalised; {{he had become a}} wealthy man. Reid claimed in his diary that he had challenged Karim over his financial dealings: [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> Queen that in India no receipts are given for money, and therefore you ought not to give any to Sir F Edwards [...] This is a lie and means that you wish to cheat the Queen." [...] The Munshi told the Queen he would provide receipts in answer to the allegations, and Victoria wrote to Reid dismissing the accusations, calling them [...] "shameful".|$|E

500|$|In June 1953, Hayward took {{command of}} the escort carrier [...] He confessed to the crew {{that he did not}} know what he was doing, and urged any crewman who felt he was doing {{something}} wrong to tell him so at once. At the end of the Korean War, the carrier was deployed at Inchon, where a baby was found abandoned in the trash at a U.S. Army depot. The baby was brought to an orphanage, and Hayward sent Point Cruzs chaplain in response to a request for assistance. The nun running the orphanage felt the blue-eyed baby would not be safe if he remained in Korea. Hayward is said to <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> chaplain: [...] "You are not to return to this vessel until you have procured that baby." ...|$|E
500|$|Livingstone faced further {{criticism}} {{following a}} television appearance {{in which he}} stated that the perpetrators of the 2005 London bombings carried out their actions as retribution for UK involvement in the Iraq War. In March 2016, Livingstone again courted controversy by comparing a hedge fund manager's £16,800 donation to Labour MP Dan Jarvis to [...] "Jimmy Savile funding a children's group"; it subsequently emerged that Livingstone himself had received £8,000 from a Bermuda-based hedge fund called Meditor for a speaking engagement, leading to accusations of hypocrisy. Livingstone responded that rather than [...] "double standards" [...] it was [...] "different standards", he was paid for a speaking engagement where he would <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> room {{of the need for}} the City to invest more in the economy, which he felt was distinct from taking a political donation from a hedge fund manager.|$|E
500|$|As {{a prayer}} tablet {{placed on a}} pier was a {{distinctive}} trait of pilgrimage churches, Harbison sees the panel as partly concerned with the phenomenon of pilgrimage. This type of tablet contained specific prayers whose recitation {{in front of a}} particular image or in the church was believed to attract an indulgence, or remission of time in Purgatory. The statue of the Virgin and Child in the niche behind Mary's left shoulder might represent such an image, whereas the inscription of a Nativity hymn around the lost frame, ending in ETCET, i.e. [...] "etcetera", would <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> viewer to recite the whole hymn, perhaps for an indulgence. The purpose of the picture, therefore, may have been to represent and bring the act of pilgrimage to a domestic setting. This would have been attractive to Philip the Good who, though he made many pilgrimages in person, is recorded as paying van Eyck to perform one on his behalf in 1426, apparently an acceptable practice in Late Medieval celestial accounting.|$|E

500|$|Outside {{the brief}} notices of Philip's {{exploits}} which occur in Diodorus and Justin, further {{details of his}} campaigns (and indeed the period in general) {{can be found in}} the orations of Athenian statesmen, primarily Demosthenes and Aeschines, which have survived intact. Since these speeches were never intended to be historical material, they must be treated with great circumspection, particularly given the identity of the authors. Demosthenes and Aeschines have been described as [...] "a couple of liars, neither of whom can be trusted to <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> truth in any matter in which it was remotely in his interest to lie". For instance, the Peace of Philocrates (made in 346 BC) is known primarily from their speeches (both called On the False Embassy), made in 343 BC, when Demosthenes prosecuted Aeschines for his involvement in making the peace treaty. In his speech, Aeschines poses as the champion of the peace treaty, when he had in fact opposed making peace; conversely, Demosthenes, who had been a proponent of peace in 346 BC represents himself as part of the [...] "war-party". The arguments made in the speeches therefore refer to the political situation in 343 BC and not the situation when the treaty was made, which makes teasing out the actual historical threads rather difficult.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council faulted CKNW, a {{radio station}} in Vancouver, British Columbia for airing [...] "potentially {{dangerous}} information" [...] during the Dawson College shooting. During the incident, CKNW had simulcast content from its sister stations in Montreal which included students speaking by cellphone from inside the school. A Vancouver man complained that the content could <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> gunman where the students were. The council said {{that as a result}} of modern technology reducing geographic distance as a barrier, CKNW had breached Section 10 (coverage of violent situations) of the broadcast code. The station broadcast the decision as required, but did not air an apology.|$|E
2500|$|There was no {{evidence}} (beyond the women's testimony) pointing to the guilt of the accused, yet that was irrelevant due to the prevalent racism in the South at the time, according to which black men were constantly being policed by white men for signs of sexual interest in white women, which could be punishable by lynching. Price and Bates may <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> police that they were raped to divert police attention from themselves.
