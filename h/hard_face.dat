500|$|By 2005, Nesbitt {{had become}} {{tired of the}} formula and {{threatened}} to quit unless {{the structure of the}} series was changed. He was made a creative consultant and suggested that Murphy keep one undercover role for a full series, instead of changing into a new guise every episode. This new dramatic element to the series was intended to make it a closer representation of real-life undercover work. Alongside his research with former undercover officer Peter Bleksley, Nesbitt hired a personal trainer and grew a handlebar moustache to change Murphy's physical characteristics and tone down the [...] "cheeky chappie" [...] persona that the audience had become accustomed to from his roles. With his trainer, he worked out three times a week, boxing and doing circuits and weights. After the first new episode was broadcast, Sarah Vine wrote in The Times, [...] "In the past, when attempting a nasty stare or a <b>hard</b> <b>face,</b> Nesbitt has never managed much more than a faintly quizzical look, hilarity forever threatening to break out behind those twinkly Irish eyes. But here, it's different. He genuinely has the air of a man who means business." [...] The refreshed series marked another milestone in Nesbitt's career; he describes it as [...] "a big moment" [...] in his life. Murphy's Law was not recommissioned for a sixth series, which Nesbitt attributed to the damage done to the fifth series ratings when it was scheduled opposite the popular ITV drama Doc Martin.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} is {{presented}} a preceding procedure that should be conducted in order to successfully regenerate damaged forging dies by the <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> process. After the tool damage types identification, {{as well as their}} causes, we have chosen the procedure and the parameters of <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> that we further corrected by conducting the test hard facings on models. Thus, we were able to relate the experimental results outputs with the repair technology, taking as a criterion the quality of the surface layers wear resistance such as friction coefficient and width of <b>hard</b> <b>faced</b> zone, hardness and its distribution in cross section, then microstructure of characteristic of <b>hard</b> <b>faced</b> zones, etc. This research points out significancy of tribological properties of certain types of carbides and their effects on metal matrix, in which carbides are embedded.

40|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>facing</b> is an {{important}} tool in tribology in which a layer of wear resistant material deposited over base metal or substrate to improve surface characteristics. There are numerous processes and consumables available in the market to improve the surface characteristics of components. This technique has potential to deposit hard-faced layer on substrate. The properties usually sought are greater resistance to wear from abrasion, impact, adhesion (metal-to-metal), heat, corrosion or any combination of these factors. <b>Hard</b> <b>facing</b> is applied only to specific areas of metal parts that are exposed to wear. There is often no need to protect the entire surface of a component from wear. <b>Hard</b> <b>facing</b> can be applied selectively and in different thickness to suit the exact requirements {{of a piece of}} equipment, thereby proving a most economical way of combating wear Shielded metal arc welding is most commonly used process for <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> due to its easy availability and versatility of operation. Low carbon steel is selected for the present work as substrate material due to its low cost, easy availability and variety of applications.

40|$|This paper gives a {{procedure}} for {{choosing the right}} technology for reparative <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> of damaged forging dies. Since {{they are subject to}} impact loads and cyclic temperature elevations, forging dies should be made of steel that is able to withstand great impact loads, maintain good mechanical properties at elevated temperatures and that is resistant to wear and thermal fatigue. For these reasons, forging dies are made of conditionally weldable alloy tool steels; however it makes <b>hard</b> <b>facing</b> of damaged tools even more difficult. In this paper, wear resistance of base materials, hard-faced layers and heat-affected zones are tribologically investigated when two different lubricants - pure synthetical oil LM 76 and LM 76 with 6 % molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) are applied. Tribological investigations have shown that the wear resistance of the <b>hard</b> <b>faced</b> layers is considerably greater than the wear resistance of the base material. However, the base material has better properties concerning friction...|$|R

Worn cutting edges of the blades were <b>hard</b> <b>faced</b> and sharpened by grinding to the shape and dimensions of new blades. Then, both new and repaired blades were alternately mounted on the rotor of the machine. Their wear was monitored under the same working and weather conditions.

In the case of locally <b>hard</b> <b>faced</b> {{spheroidal graphite cast iron}} with hard alloy briquettes, the inserted layer as formed with penetration of the molten cast iron among tungsten carbide (henceforth, it is described as WC) particles in the hard alloy briquette. The base metal of inserted layer showed a microstructure of gray cast iron due to a hindrance to spheroidalization caused by a reaction the molten cast iron to the elements of W and Co in the hard alloy. The hardness of mother spheroidal graphite cast iron was about Vickers hardness (henceforth, it is described as HV) 200 while the hardness of the inserted layer ranged from HV 600 to HV 1600. In the case of locally <b>hard</b> <b>faced</b> cast steel, the inserted layer was also formed with similar process to that of the spheroidal graphite cast iron, while intermediate phases with very hard complex carbide were formed at the bonding region between the inserted layer and the base metal. The hardness of mother cast steel was about HV 300, while the hardness of the inserted layer ranged from HV 800 to HV 1400. Especially, the intermediate layer with complex carbide showed the highest hardness of HV 1800.
