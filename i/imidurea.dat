40|$|A {{sensitive}} and specific normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC) method with UV detection {{has been developed}} and validated for the quantification of formic acid in pharmaceutical excipient <b>imidurea.</b> The chromatographic separation was carried out on a Hypersil Silica 250 x 4. 6 mm, 5 µ (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA) with a flow rate of 0. 5 mL/min and the column temperature was maintained at 30 °C. The mobile phase consisted of n-hexane-isopropyl alcohol-trifluoroacetic acid (900 : 100 : 0. 5, v/v/v). The samples were injected with an injection volume of 20 µL and detection was accomplished by a variable wavelength UV detector at 230 nm. The retention time of formic acid was about 8. 9 min. The method was linear over the range of 331 - 7500 µg/mL for formic acid with a correlation of 0. 9928. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were 109 and 331 µg/mL respectively. The present method may be applicable {{for the detection of}} formic acid in different pharmaceutical product as well...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Ureides are compounds, which {{essentially}} incorporate urea as a substructural component {{either in}} open or cyclic form. Ureido derivatives {{are one of}} the oldest classes of bioactives, widely used as antiinfective agents. Several of these compounds, including aminoquinuride, aminocarbalide, <b>imidurea,</b> cloflucarban, nitrofurazone, urosulfan, viomycin are used in clinical situations. One of the ureides, the triclocarban is compulsorily used as antibacterial agent in cleansing and disinfecting solutions in hospital, household, cosmetics, toys, textile and plastics. It disables the activity of ENR, an enzyme vital for building the cell wall of the bacteria and fungus. Besides, the ureido-penicillins in clinical use there have been several ureido-lactam derivatives which have been reported to exhibit significant antibacterial activity. A urea containing dipeptide TAN- 1057 A isolated from Flexibacter spp. has potent bioactivity against MRSA. The metal complexes of sulphonyl ureido derivatives are effective antifungal agents by inhibiting the activity of phosphomannose isomerase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of yeast cell walls. There have been number of ureides including the cyclic ureas which are potent HIV protease inhibitors and display significant anti-HIV activity. The urea derivative, merimepodip that has been derived using structure based design, is potent inhibitor of IMPDH and is active against Hepatitis-C infection. This review will primarily focus on the significant work reported for this class of compounds including design, synthesis and biological activity...|$|E
