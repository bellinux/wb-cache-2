5|$|Among major {{structural}} elements used in poetry are the line, the stanza or verse paragraph, and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as cantos. Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations {{of words and}} calligraphy. These basic units of poetic form are often combined <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> structures, called poetic forms or poetic modes (see following section), as in the sonnet or haiku.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th century, a new fiscal {{system was}} {{introduced}} and the hundreds were gradually included <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> administrative units called len, with a castle {{serving as the}} administrative center.

5|$|The gongs, themselves, {{although}} {{variable in}} pitch, are relatively similar in size. Diameters range from 1.8 to 2 feet and 5 to 8inches (including the boss) in width for the smallest to largest gongs respectively. Because of their slight differences, smaller gongs {{could be placed}} <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> gongs, making transport of these gongs more portable than an agung’s, whose turned-in-rim eliminates that possibility.|$|E

5|$|As {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling {{to compete with the}} volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1919, the Commission {{had spent}} £7,500, and this figure rose to £250,000 in 1920 as {{construction}} of cemeteries and memorials increased. By 1921, the Commission had established 1,000cemeteries which were ready for headstone erections, and burials. Between 1920 and 1923, the Commission was shipping 4,000headstones a week to France. In many cases, the Commission closed small cemeteries and concentrated the graves <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> ones. By 1927, when the majority of construction had been completed, over 500cemeteries had been built, with 400,000headstones, a thousand Crosses of Sacrifice, and 400 Stones of Remembrance.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral veins drain deoxygenated {{blood from}} the brain. The brain has two main {{networks}} of veins: an exterior or superficial network, {{on the surface of}} the cerebrum that has three branches, and an interior network. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins. The veins of the brain drain <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull. Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. Blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins.|$|E
5|$|Following the 15th century Reformation when {{clerical}} {{marriage was}} permitted, larger households {{would have been}} required {{and as a result}} some of the houses were altered and combined by knocking through walls, <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> dwellings. Others had extensions built to the rear. Water supply was originally from two wells, one {{at each end of the}} close. By 1468 lead pipes had been installed to bring water into the houses, although the wells continued to function until the 19th century. Number 22 is the house which still has most of its original medieval structure as it was originally built.|$|E

5|$|Founded around 1020 {{to educate}} priests for the cathedral, Roskilde Cathedral School is {{possibly}} the oldest school in Denmark. Initially located {{close to the}} cathedral, it moved <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> premises in 1969 to accommodate {{an increasing number of}} pupils (currently over 1,300). The Danish Meat Trade College (Slagteriskolen), founded in 1964, is a non-profit institution offering vocational training courses in industrial slaughter, retail butchering, sausage making, nutrition and the meat service sector. Training is also offered to kitchen staff, waiters, cooks and bakers. The school employs about 150 teachers and supporting staff. Courses are also available for international students. There is a hostel with accommodation for some 200 students.|$|E
5|$|Pallas {{is thought}} to have {{undergone}} at least some degree of thermal alteration and partial differentiation, which suggests that it is a remnant protoplanet. During the planetary formation stage of the Solar System, objects grew in size through an accretion process to approximately this size. Many of these objects were incorporated <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> bodies, which became the planets, whereas others were destroyed in collisions with other protoplanets. Pallas and Vesta are likely survivors from this early stage of planetary formation.|$|E
5|$|Predynastic Egypt {{originally}} {{consisted of}} small, independent villages. Because many deities in later times were {{strongly tied to}} particular towns and regions, many scholars {{have suggested that the}} pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> states, spreading and intermingling the worship of the old local deities. But others have argued that the most important predynastic gods were, like other elements of Egyptian culture, present all across the country despite the political divisions within it.|$|E

5|$|Stallions must be {{registered}} New Foresters, {{and are not}} allowed to run free all year round on the Forest. They normally are turned out only for a limited period in the spring and summer, when they gather several groups of mares and youngstock <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> herds and defend them against other stallions. A small number (usually fewer than 50) are turned out, generally between May and August. This ensures that foals are born neither too early (before the spring grass is coming through), nor too late (as the colder weather is setting in and the grazing and browsing on the Forest is dying back) in the following year.|$|E
5|$|The cantata was {{commissioned}} by the minister {{of one of the}} churches in Mühlhausen, the city where Bach worked at the time. It was possibly written for a special occasion. The text is based on Luther's German version of Psalm 130 and also incorporates the words of a chorale. Bach's music integrates melodies from the chorale <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> structures. Bach also shows his interest in counterpoint, something which was characteristic of him throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|The genus Equus {{was first}} {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It {{is the only}} recognized extant genus in the family Equidae. The first equids were small, dog-sized mammals (e.g. Eohippus) adapted for browsing on shrubs during the Eocene, around 54 million years ago (mya). These animals had three toes on the hind feet and four on the front feet with small hooves in place of claws but also had soft pads. Equids developed <b>into</b> <b>larger,</b> three-toed animals (e.g. Mesohippus) during the Oligocene and Miocene. From there, the tridactyl toes became progressively smaller through the Pleistocene until {{the emergence of the}} single-toed Equus.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} such motif is the double {{crossover}} (DX) complex, which contains two Holliday junctions {{in close proximity}} to each other, resulting in a rigid structure that can self-assemble <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> arrays. The structure of the DX molecule forces the Holliday junctions to adopt a conformation with the double-helical domains directly side-by-side, in contrast to their preferred angle of about 60°. The complex can be designed to force the junctions into either a parallel or antiparallel orientation, but in practice the antiparallel variety are more well-behaved, and the parallel version is rarely used.|$|E
5|$|The world's {{languages}} can {{be grouped}} into language families consisting of languages {{that can be}} shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of language isolates: languages that cannot {{be shown to be}} related to any other languages in the world. Among them are Basque, spoken in Europe, Zuni of New Mexico, Purépecha of Mexico, Ainu of Japan, Burushaski of Pakistan, and many others.|$|E
5|$|While at university, Taborn toured and {{recorded}} with jazz saxophonist James Carter. Taborn {{went on to}} play with numerous other musicians in electronic and acoustic settings, while also building {{a reputation as a}} solo pianist. He has a range of styles, and often adapts his playing {{to the nature of the}} instrument and the sounds that he can make it produce. His improvising, particularly for solo piano, often adopts a modular approach, in which he begins with small units of melody and rhythm and then develops them <b>into</b> <b>larger</b> forms and structures.|$|E
