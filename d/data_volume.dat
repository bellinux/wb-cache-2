50|$|ICER is a wavelet-based image {{compressor}} {{that allows}} for a graceful trade-off {{between the amount of}} compression (expressed in terms of compressed <b>data</b> <b>volume</b> in bits/pixel) and the resulting degradation in image quality (distortion).

50|$|Speech data {{is stored}} through pitch-excited linear {{predictive}} coding (PE-LPC), where words are created by a lattice filter, selectably fed by either an excitation ROM (containing a glottal pulse waveform) or an LFSR (linear feedback shift register) noise generator. Linear predictive coding achieves a vast reduction in <b>data</b> <b>volume</b> needed to recreate intelligible speech data.|$|E
50|$|Other {{models are}} the {{hierarchical}} model and network model. Some systems using these older architectures {{are still in}} use today in data centers with high <b>data</b> <b>volume</b> needs, or where existing systems are so complex and abstract it would be cost-prohibitive to migrate to systems employing the relational model. Also of note are newer object-oriented databases.|$|E

50|$|As new {{technology}} comes out {{that is more}} portable and capable of creating and storing more information, {{it is the responsibility}} of HR to define how employees interact with the data. According to a Deloitte study in August 2008, 90% of employer data is electronically stored information (ESI), and 40% of executives say that <b>data</b> <b>volumes</b> are becoming unmanageable. Unmanageable data makes locating relevant data more challenging which can manifest into significant losses through wasted storage space and reductions in productivity. Excessive <b>data</b> <b>volumes</b> is especially troublesome during litigation that requires electronic discovery.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} arrays, the {{huge amount of}} {{incoming}} sensory information requires real-time array processing capability {{in order to reduce}} <b>data</b> <b>volume</b> for storage. For ATA-256, the average data rates and total <b>data</b> <b>volume</b> for the correlator are estimated to be 100 Mbyte/s and 15 Pbytes for the five-year survey period. Experiments such as transient surveys will exceed this rate significantly. The beamformers produce data at a much higher rate (8 gigabytes per second (Gb/s)) but only a very small fraction of this data is archived. In 2009, the signal detection hardware and software was called Prelude, which wascomposed of rack-mounted PCs augmented by two custom accelerator cards based on digital signal processing (DSP) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips. Each Programmable Detection Module (one of 28 PCs) can analyze 2 MHz of dual-polarization input data to generate spectra with spectral resolution of 0.7 Hz and time samples of 1.4 seconds.|$|E

40|$|Main goal of {{the thesis}} was to {{research}} or propose a suitable method for substitution of <b>volume</b> <b>data</b> including <b>volume</b> <b>data</b> derived from motion pictures by irregular tetrahedron-based grids. The method should minimize the loss of information {{and the size of}} the data. The thesis proposes a method for finding a suitable tetrahedron grid that substitutes the <b>volume</b> <b>data</b> without assuming anything about its inner structure. The proposed method can be applied on both <b>volume</b> <b>data</b> and <b>volume</b> <b>data</b> from motion pictures. The method consists of two steps. First a basic grid is generated by a simple incremental algorithm and then it is improved by a process of simulated annealing. The thesis proposes an unbiased measure for measuring the loss of information and evaluates the suitability of the proposed method for both types of data based on experiments. The thesis includes an implementation of the proposed method which demonstrates its use. The thesis also includes sample <b>volume</b> <b>data</b> and motion picture <b>volume</b> <b>data</b> which were used to test the suitability of the method...|$|R
