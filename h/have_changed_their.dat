5|$|Lexical {{differences}} between dialects are often considerable. This {{is due to}} the earlier cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which had served as names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.|$|E

5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Burger's Daughter came when Gordimer {{was waiting to}} visit a political detainee in prison, and amongst the other visitors she saw a school girl, {{the daughter of an}} activist she knew. She wondered what this child was thinking and what family obligations were making her stand there. The novel opens with the same scene: a 14-year-old Rosa Burger waiting outside a prison to visit her detained mother. Gordimer said that children like these, whose activist parents were frequently arrested and detained, periodically had to manage entire households on their own, and it must <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> lives completely. She stated that it was these children who encouraged her to write the book.|$|E
5|$|Some of the county's {{secondary}} schools have specialist school status. Some schools have sixth forms and others transfer their sixth formers to colleges. Several schools can trace their origins back many years, such as The Blue School in Wells and Richard Huish College in Taunton. Others <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> names {{over the years}} such as Beechen Cliff School which was started in 1905 as the City of Bath Boys' School and changed to its present name in 1972 when the grammar school was amalgamated with a local secondary modern school, to form a comprehensive school. Many others were established and built since the Second World War. In 2006, 5,900 pupils in Somerset sat GCSE examinations, with 44.5% achieving 5 grades A-C including English and Maths (compared to 45.8% for England).|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of various pure breeds and strains, including {{some that are}} rare today, was once undertaken in North America {{in large part by}} large agriculture-focused colleges and universities. However, many of these institutions <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> focus to commercial or crossbred strains, with many herds being sent to slaughter. The Livestock Conservancy and Rare Breeds Canada intervened in some of these cases, leading to the survival and {{preservation of}} some gene stocks. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) participates in livestock preservation mainly through technology-based approaches such as gene mapping and germplasm (genetic material) storage. However, although the storage of genetic material is a useful technique in the preservation of rare breeds, it cannot preserve the entire range of genetic diversity within even an individual breed, and stored material cannot react and adapt to environmental or biological changes as live animal populations can. The US federal government rarely supports rare breed live animal population conservation, and while agricultural subsidies were once seen more than they are in present times, they were never focused on individual breeds. The Livestock Conservancy has been instrumental in preserving live populations of many rare livestock breeds in the US.|$|E

25|$|Women's {{personal}} name changes were recorded less often, {{so they may}} not <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> names as frequently as men did, but women who went into service as maids or entertainers frequently changed their names {{for the duration of}} their service. During their employment, their temporary names were treated as their legal names. For example, a maid who was involved in legal dealings in Kyoto in 1819-1831 signed legal documents as Sayo during one period of employment and as Mitsu during a later period of employment, but she signed as Iwa, presumably her birth name, when she was between jobs.|$|E
25|$|The BRIC thesis {{recognizes that}} Brazil, Russia, India and China <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> {{political}} systems to embrace global capitalism. Goldman Sachs predicts that China and India, respectively, {{will become the}} dominant global suppliers of manufactured goods and services, while Brazil and Russia will become similarly dominant as suppliers of raw materials. Of the four countries, Brazil remains the only polity that {{has the capacity to}} continue all elements, meaning manufacturing, services and resource supplying simultaneously. Cooperation is thus hypothesized to be a logical next step among the BRICs because Brazil and Russia together form the logical commodity suppliers.|$|E

25|$|Many {{communities}} in Los Angeles <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> ethnic character over {{this period of}} time.

While the Latino community within the City of Los Angeles was once centered on the Eastside, it now extends throughout the city.
