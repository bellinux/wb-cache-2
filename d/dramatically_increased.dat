5|$|By July7, 30shelters opened across five parishes, with {{at least}} 793people using their services. Some {{officials}} complained that residents refused to evacuate. However, as the storm impacted the island this number <b>dramatically</b> <b>increased</b> to 6,000people with shelters open in all parishes. Approximately J$25million (US$405,000) was made available for relief operations through the nation's Disaster Mitigation Programme. An additional J$20million (US$324,000) was allocated for clearing drains in preparation for heavy rain.|$|E

5|$|The California Gold Rush in {{the mid-19th}} century <b>dramatically</b> <b>increased</b> travel by European-Americans in the area, causing {{competition}} for resources between the regional Paiute and Miwok and the miners and hangers on. In 1851 {{as part of the}} Mariposa Wars intended to suppress Native American resistance, United States Army Major Jim Savage led the Mariposa Battalion into the west end of Yosemite Valley.

5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has <b>dramatically</b> <b>increased</b> in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E

5|$|Female {{elephants}} {{spend their}} entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, {{some of which are}} made up of more than ten members, including three pairs of mothers with offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal corticosterone ('stress hormone') <b>dramatically</b> <b>increased</b> in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present. The older matriarchs tend to be more effective decision-makers.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the start}} of Operation Barbarossa, the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, Graf claimed his first aerial victory on 4 August 1941. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross after 45 victories on 24 January 1942. It was during the second summer of the eastern campaign; however, that his success rate <b>dramatically</b> <b>increased.</b> By 16 September 1942 his number of victories had increased to 172 {{for which he was}} honored with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. At the time of its presentation to Graf it was Germany's highest military decoration. On 26 September 1942 he shot down his 200th enemy aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Soviet-oriented parties, {{backed by}} the Soviet Red Army and {{in control of the}} {{security}} forces, held most of the power, concentrated especially in the Polish Workers' Party under Władysław Gomułka and Bolesław Bierut. Bierut represented the influx of appointees to the Polish party coming (during and after the war) from the Soviet Union and imposed by the Soviets, a process accelerated {{at the time of the}} PPR Congress of December 1945. The party's membership <b>dramatically</b> <b>increased</b> from perhaps a few thousand in early 1945 to over one million in 1948.|$|E

5|$|The {{part of the}} Sierra Nevada {{where the}} park is located was long {{considered}} to be a physical barrier to European American settlers, traders, trappers, and travelers. That situation changed in 1848 after gold was discovered in the foothills west of the range. Travel and trade activity <b>dramatically</b> <b>increased</b> in the area during the ensuing California Gold Rush. Resources depended upon by local Native Americans were depleted or destroyed, and disease brought by the newcomers spread rapidly through indigenous populations. Extermination of native culture became a policy of the United States Government.|$|E
5|$|When any {{aircraft}} {{passes the}} critical mach {{of that particular}} airframe, the centre of pressure shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch down moment on the aircraft if the centre of gravity remains where it was. The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift, {{but there was still}} a shift of about 2metres. This could have been countered by the use of trim controls, but at such high speeds this would have <b>dramatically</b> <b>increased</b> drag. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of gravity, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.|$|E
5|$|As landholders and drafted {{government}} officials, the gentry {{considered themselves}} the leading members of society; gaining their cooperation and employment was {{essential for the}} county or provincial bureaucrat overburdened with official duties. In many ways, scholar-officials of the Song period differed from the more aristocratic scholar-officials of the Tang dynasty (618–907). Civil service examinations became the primary means of appointment to an official post as competitors vying for official degrees <b>dramatically</b> <b>increased.</b> Frequent disagreements amongst ministers of state on ideological and policy issues led to political strife {{and the rise of}} political factions. This undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which broke apart as a social group and gave way to a multitude of families which provided sons for civil service.|$|E

5|$|Meats {{were more}} {{expensive}} than plant foods. Though rich in protein, the calorie-to-weight ratio of meat was {{less than that of}} plant food. Meat could be up to four times as expensive as bread. Fish was up to 16 times as costly, and was expensive even for coastal populations. This meant that fasts could mean an especially meager diet for those who could not afford alternatives to meat and animal products like milk and eggs. It was only after the Black Death had eradicated up to half of the European population that meat became more common even for poorer people. The drastic reduction in many populated areas resulted in a labor shortage, meaning that wages <b>dramatically</b> <b>increased.</b> It also left vast areas of farmland untended, making them available for pasture and putting more meat on the market.|$|E
5|$|On November21, {{insurance}} {{payments for}} losses {{were expected to}} exceed $12million. On January1, 1963, a $2million relief fund was authorized by President Kennedy. Another $5.4million in relief funds were provided by President Lyndon B. Johnson on February15, 1964. The United States Congress provided Guam with $60million, including $45million through federal loans, mainly to help rebuild the territory and promote expansion of the economy. Additionally, the storm brought {{about the end of}} military security on the island, which in turn aided economic growth. Within five years of this decision, Japanese tourism to the island <b>dramatically</b> <b>increased,</b> prompting a major {{increase in the number of}} hotels. In the long term, Typhoon Karen, along with other destructive storms, shaped the development of the island's infrastructure. It led to higher quality buildings and more efficient utilities that could withstand powerful typhoons. Since Karen, most buildings on the island have been constructed with concrete and steel.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are <b>dramatically</b> <b>increased</b> by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E
