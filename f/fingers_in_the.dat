5|$|Appearing on a {{document}} of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has {{a picture of}} a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk with the book in one hand and three outstretched <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. By the 19th century the figure was portrayed as youthful and became known as the Münchner Kindl or Munich Child. The coat of arms in its current form was created in 1957 and is still an important symbol of the Bavarian state capital.|$|E
5|$|When the Munich town {{administration}} {{developed a}} constitution of its council, a seal {{was necessary for}} the purposes of asserting the authenticity of town-council documents. Appearing on a document of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has a picture of a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk with the book in one hand and three outstretched <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. The monk as a sole heraldic figure can be found on a seal dating from the year 1304, and on flags of the city since the middle of the 14th century. Colourful representations of the town's coat of arms stem from the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E

30|$|Lenormand et al. (1983) {{reported}} that chemically etched networks on glass plates give clear observations, but {{the shape of}} the ducts is not well defined. Moreover, according to the proposed phase diagram by Lenormand (1985), the applied experimental conditions of capillary number and viscosity ratio show qualitatively that the flow regime ranges between capillary fingering at low capillary number and viscous fingering at high capillary number. Lenormand (1985) also {{reported that}} capillary <b>fingering</b> results <b>in</b> higher displacement efficiency as opposed to viscous fingering. Figure  6 shows that the same injection rate results in high capillary number <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-permeability layer, followed by the medium- and low-permeability layers, respectively. Hence, it is most probable that viscous <b>fingering</b> occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first layer, capillary <b>fingering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third layer, and transition capillary-to-viscous <b>fingering</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle layer.|$|R

The Cardinals could have made it worse, but McGee lined out to short for out #2, and an apparent base hit by Ozzie Smith struck Braun as he was running to second for the third out.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} some modern full rollers such as Dave Ewald and Tom Smallwood. A full roller rolls the ball {{in such a way}} that the ball tracks over its full circumference, thus the name full roller. In {{addition}} to a full circumference ball track, the ball track itself crosses between the fingers and thumb through the palm in a diagonal path. A full roller release can be very straight such as Billy Hardwick rolled, or have up to a 90 degree or greater axis of rotation such as Tom Smallwood rolls. Usually a suitcase style grip with the thumb in the 9 o'clock position and the <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 3 o'clock position (for a right hander) at the moment of release will create a full roller track. As the hand comes forward the thumb exits first, and the fingers still at 3 o'clock, lift up through the ball, causing it to rotate off the fingers to the left, creating side rotation and a horizontal track through the palm center of the ball.|$|E

Michael sings [...] "I don't want to work/I just want to bang on this mug all day" [...] {{to the tune of}} Bang the Drum All Day by Todd Rundgren. Jim alludes to the Jets, one of the rival street gangs in the musical West Side Story, by quoting the noted lyrics [...] "When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way", as well as {{snapping}} his <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way as the gang members.

He hit [...]319, fourth in the AL, and {{led the league in}} hits (135), runs (89) and in steals (56). Henderson was also 3rd in on-base percentage (.408), tied for 2nd in triples (7), 4th in walks (64), 8th in total bases (185) and 2nd in times reaching base (201). In so doing, he became the emblematic figure of Oakland manager Billy Martin's aggressive [...] "Billy Ball" [...] philosophy, which received much media attention. Finishing second to the Milwaukee Brewers' Rollie <b>Fingers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MVP voting, Henderson's fielding that season also earned him his only Gold Glove Award. He later became known for his showboating [...] "snatch catches", in which he would flick his glove out at incoming fly balls, then whip his arm behind his back after making the catch.|$|E

2500|$|The 12 to 6 curveball is {{the toughest}} type of curveball to hit, because it moves vertically, and has no {{horizontal}} break. [...] The difference of the speed from a fastball and the break make the pitch difficult to hit if a pitcher uses it correctly in a pitching sequence. The 12 to 6 curveball is usually pitched from the overhand motion, as a three-quarters or sidearm delivery would cause the ball to break 2 to 8 instead of 12 to 6. The sharp vertical break on the 12–6 curveball is created when pitchers apply topspin to the ball with their <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of releasing it.|$|E

The spring-operated delivery channel then transports the line into the casting section of the machine, and engages the clutch that drives the casting section and the subsequent transfer into the distribution section.

This ceremony dates back to the ninth century. An aspergill or aspergillum is a brush or branch used to sprinkle the water. An aspersorium is the vessel which holds the holy water and into which the aspergillum is dipped, though elaborate Ottonian examples are known as situlae. Blessed salt may be added to the water [...] "where it is customary." ...|$|E

Harry is unable to open the Snitch until {{he is about to}} die in the Forest, and realizes then [...] "the close" [...] means the end, or his death. Harry uses the Stone to summon his deceased loved ones - his parents, his godfather Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin - to comfort him and strengthen his courage, before he goes to meet his death at Voldemort's hand. The stone falls unseen from Harry's numb <b>fingers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Forbidden Forest as he reaches Voldemort's encampment.
