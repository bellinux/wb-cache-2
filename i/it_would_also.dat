5|$|In November 2008, Qualcomm {{announced}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> {{compete against}} Intel in the netbook processor market with dual-core Snapdragon system-on-chips planned for late 2009. It demonstrated a Snapdragon processor that consumed less power than Intel chips announced {{around the same}} time and claimed <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> cost less when released. That same month, Qualcomm introduced a Snapdragon-based prototype netbook called Kayak that used 1.5GHz processors and was intended for developing markets.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{announced}} that Windows Server 2008 R2 {{would be the}} last version of Windows Server to support the Itanium (support started with XP), and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> discontinue development of the Itanium versions of Visual Studio and SQL Server.|$|E
5|$|The Secret of the Unicorn was set {{entirely in}} Belgium {{and was the}} last Adventure to be set there until The Castafiore Emerald. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> be Hergé's {{favourite}} story until Tintin in Tibet.|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>would</b> seem, <b>also,</b> {{though this}} is more disputable, {{that there are some}} self-evident ethical principles, such as 'we ought to pursue what is good'.|$|R
5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a {{pull on the}} attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope was attached to ballast, so that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> be activated automatically {{in the case of}} a catastrophic loss of ballast. Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the Patrie.|$|E
5|$|After THQ's {{dissolution}} in January 2013, it {{was reported}} that the publishing rights for the WWE video game series were acquired by Take-Two Interactive. Take-Two confirmed the acquisition in February, saying that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> retain the services of Yuke's and the THQ staff that worked on the WWE series. WWE 2K14 is the first game to be released under the 2K brand.|$|E
5|$|Blyton and Darrell Waters {{married at}} the City of Westminster Register Office on 20 October 1943. She changed the surname of her daughters to Darrell Waters and {{publicly}} embraced her new role as a happily married and devoted doctor's wife. After discovering she was pregnant {{in the spring of}} 1945, Blyton miscarried five months later, following a fall from a ladder. The baby would have been Darrell Waters's first child and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> have been the son for which both of them longed.|$|E
50|$|An earlier planned arena, named YRT2 Arena, was to {{have opened}} in 2008. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> have <b>also</b> been home to a future ECHL franchise, the Myrtle Beach Thunderboltz.|$|R

5|$|Deeper (average: 3m) {{and much}} wider (av. 10m) {{perimeter}} ditches (fossae). These would have flat floors {{rather than the}} traditional V-shape. Such ditches would {{make it difficult to}} bring siege equipment (ladders, rams, and other engines) to the walls. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> concentrate attackers in an enclosed area where they would be exposed to missile fire from the walls.|$|E
5|$|Following the well-received Get Behind Me Satan, Icky Thump {{marked a}} return to the punk, garage rock and blues {{influences}} for which the band is known. It was recorded at Nashville's Blackbird Studio and took almost three weeks to record—the longest of any White Stripes album. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> be their first album with a title track. The album's release came {{on the heels of a}} series of concerts in Europe and one in North America at Bonnaroo.|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{was welcomed}} by Duke Wilhelm who {{appointed}} him as court Cosmographer. There is no precise definition of this term {{other than that}} it certainly comprehends the disciplines of geography and astronomy {{but at that time}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> include astrology and chronology (as a history of the world from the creation). All of these were among Mercator's accomplishments but his patron's first call on his services was as a mundane surveyor of the disputed boundary between the Duke's territory of the County of Mark and the Duchy of Westphalia.|$|E
50|$|The {{movie was}} a {{commercial}} failure, a fact which caused distribution {{problems for the}} other Oz Film titles that followed <b>it.</b> This <b>would</b> <b>also</b> contribute to the failing of The Oz Film Manufacturing Company.|$|R
5000|$|The {{move was}} {{intended}} to reduce Seoul's overcrowding and economic dominance {{over the rest of}} South Korea; perhaps not coincidentally, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>also</b> moved the government and administration out of range of North Korean artillery fire.|$|R

5|$|New Jersey Governor Jon S. Corzine and the Delaware River Port Authority {{announced}} a comprehensive transportation plan for South Jersey on May12,2009. This plan would introduce express bus service along the Route55 freeway and the adjacent Route42 freeway. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> include a diesel light rail line between Camden and Glassboro via Woodbury over an existing railroad right-of-way (as {{opposed to the}} expanded PATCO line via Route55), improvements to New Jersey Transit's Atlantic City Line, and enhanced connections to the Atlantic City International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Peaking at only 146 on the Billboard 200, {{the album}} was not a {{commercial}} success, and received only lukewarm critical attention. The UHF soundtrack {{is one of only}} a few of Yankovic's studio albums that is not certified either Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> be Yankovic's last studio album to be released on vinyl record in the US until 2011's Alpocalypse.|$|E
5|$|Phase I {{consisted}} of new subway lines {{to supplement the}} IND Queens Boulevard Line and the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, {{as well as new}} interlockings and modernized station termini to increase train capacity. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> comprise the renovation of deteriorating transit routes. Originally, Phase I was to cost $961 million, but costs went up to $1.6 billion. Phase I would have been completed over the span of a decade.|$|E
50|$|Date Masamune and Mogami Yoshiaki, daimyo {{of large}} nearby domains, laid siege to this castle, {{beginning}} {{the conflict in}} the north between the representatives of Ishida and Tokugawa. <b>Its</b> capture <b>would</b> <b>also</b> mark the first contribution of Date Masamune to the Sekigahara campaign.|$|R
5000|$|If an {{advocacy}} organization {{is behind the}} ad, {{the head of the}} organization, and whoever is funding the ad would have to appear in the ad and approve <b>it.</b> They <b>would</b> <b>also</b> have to list the top five funders paying for the ad.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{production was}} in 1870 by William Mason of Church Gresley (later Mason Cash); the early price list {{refers to the}} pieces as Motto Ware, although <b>it</b> <b>would</b> later <b>also</b> be called Barge Ware due to its association with the canals.|$|R
5|$|The Yankees would however receive {{one notable}} moment of glory against the Red Sox during this era. On April 24, 1917 Yankee pitcher George Mogridge threw a no-hitter at Fenway Park, {{the first in}} the ball park's history and first in Yankee history. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> {{turn out to be the}} Yankees' only no-hitter where they allowed a run as they would win the game, 2–1.|$|E
5|$|The last {{episode of}} the series was on 13 April 1996 and also saw Peters leave the show however unbeknown at the time, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> be Forbes last show too.

5|$|The {{project was}} never carried out, being {{cancelled}} primarily {{out of a}} fear of a negative public reaction, with the potential militarization of space that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> have signified, and because a moon landing would undoubtedly be a more popular achievement {{in the eyes of}} the American and international public alike. A similar project by the Soviet Union also never came to fruition.|$|E
5000|$|Op Fietse {{was used}} for two Dutch TV commercials. The first of which was one for Calvé, a Dutch brand of peanut butter dating back to 2005. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> later <b>also</b> be used in an {{advertisement}} for ING, a major bank in the Netherlands.|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{increased}} litigation over contact, {{this article examines the}} debate around proposals for a presumption of ‘shared parenting’. It concludes that such a presumption would not achieve the aims of its proponents. <b>Its</b> introduction <b>would</b> <b>also</b> be fraught with practical and doctrinal problems...|$|R
50|$|The {{re-opening}} of Dudley {{tunnel and}} the railway on which <b>it</b> runs <b>would</b> <b>also</b> make an ideal diversion route for passenger trains if the need arose, although {{the idea of}} re-introducing passenger trains on the route (as was proposed back in 1997) seems unlikely to proceed.|$|R
5|$|There is no upgrade path to Windows 10 for devices running Windows RT. Windows 10 Mobile, {{based on}} Windows Phone, was {{unveiled}} {{for use on}} future tablets and smartphones with ARM architecture.

5|$|While MLS {{has looked}} into {{changing}} to a fall-to-spring format, {{there are no}} current plans to do so. If the league were to change its schedule, a substantial winter break would still be necessary due to teams being located in harsh winter climates. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> {{have to compete with}} the popularity and media presence of the National Football League (NFL) in the fall and winter as well as the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL), which both run on fall-to-spring schedules.|$|E
5|$|X-Men had {{its premiere}} at Ellis Island on July 12, 2000, {{two days before}} a wide opening in 3,025theaters in North America. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> debut in Australia that weekend to take {{advantage}} of the school holidays, while most other territories would get the film in August. Marvel Studios was depending on X-Mens success to ignite other franchise properties (Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Hulk, and Daredevil).|$|E

30|$|Comparing ARROW {{with other}} geo-routing {{algorithms}} like Angular Relaying, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be <b>also</b> interesting {{to verify the}} real memory usage and energy consumption. This, though, depends strictly on the specific hardware where the geo-routing protocol is implemented and thus it is a topic for future work.|$|R
50|$|Bookmice is a Canadian children's {{educational}} sitcom, where {{a public}} library is secretly inhabited by three fun loving mice.
