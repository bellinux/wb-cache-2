40|$|By {{reducing}} the excess {{burden of the}} federal tax system and encouraging economically productive behavior, this initiative would simultaneously provide a near-term stimulus to the U. S. economy and support its long-term economic growth. By ameliorating financing constraints among small and medium-sized firms that are organized as proprietorships, partnerships, or S corporations whose income and <b>expenses</b> <b>flow</b> through to their shareholders for federal income tax purposes, accelerating marginal individual federal income tax rate reductions would stimulate not only labor force participation but also aggregate investment during the near term. Ending the double taxation of corporate income would reduce agency problems between the executives of publicly held corporations and their shareholders that cause such corporations to make less than efficient investments. Therefore, ending double taxation not only would increase the quantity of aggregate investment but also would improve its quality. Ending double taxation would enhance the efficiency, neutrality, and fairness of the federal tax system and would increase the long-term growth potential for the U. S. economy. Because the public generally believes that policymakers will not allow the tax relief provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) to expire on December 31, 2010, as mandated under current law, failure to make EGTRRA’s existing tax relief provisions permanent would invalidate the public’s perception o...|$|E

30|$|While {{there is}} not much doubt that {{remittances}} increase the incomes of recipient households, their use is also important when discussing impacts on development. There is much evidence that remittances are used primarily to increase consumption, in particular of food and clothing, and less frequently for investment purposes (Davis et al. 2010; Mansoor and Quillin 2006) 2. Haxhikadrija (2009) reports that in Kosovo the receipt of remittances is often followed by the purchase of leisure goods such as satellite dishes, mobile phones or cameras. Next to daily expenses, rural households primarily use remittances to improve their basic equipment, whereas investment in education seems rather rare; in rural areas the differences in the possession of goods, such as televisions, refrigerators, washing machines and cars, between migrant and non-migrant households are clearly visible. As such <b>expenses</b> frequently <b>flow</b> into imported goods, trickle down effects and thus longer term impacts on development and poverty reduction may be hampered. For farm households in neighbouring Albania, Miluka et al. (2010) suggest that migration is used by rural households as a way out of agriculture. For Kosovo there are, however, no indications that significant amounts of remittances are used for this purpose, yet, those few households that do report business investments often make use of remittances (Möllers et al. 2013; Gashi and Haxhikadrija 2012).|$|R

Effects of cyanide (KCN) and salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) on O 2 uptake rates were determined. O 2 uptake was faster in light-grown tissue and was inhibited by both KCN and SHAM in all except light-grown tissue older than 9 days. Both inhibitors stimulated O 2 uptake in tissues more than 9 days old. Mitochondria in which O 2 uptake was coupled to ATP synthesis were isolated from all tissues. O 2 uptake by mitochondrial preparations from light- and dark-grown cotyledons was equally sensitive to KCN. Similarly, age did not affect KCN sensitivity, but sensitivity to SHAM declined with age both in the presence and absence of KCN. Estimated capacities of the cytochrome and alternative pathways of the mitochondrial preparations indicated considerably larger cytochrome than alternative pathway capacities. The cytochrome pathway capacities paralleled the state 3 mitochondrial respiration rates, which increased from day 5 to day 7 then declined thereafter. The alternative pathway capacities were not affected by light. The uncoupler, p-trifluoromethoxycarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP), increased the flow of electrons through the cytochrome pathway at the <b>expense</b> of <b>flow</b> through the alternative pathway in isolated mitochondria.

40|$|Quality of Service (QoS) in {{real-time}} media applications {{is an area}} {{of current}} interest because of the increasing demand for audio/video, and generally multimedia applications, over best effort networks, such as the Internet. Media applications are transported using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and tend to use a disproportionate amount of network bandwidth as they do not perform congestion or flow control. Methods for application QoS control are desirable to enable users to perceive a consistent media quality. This can be accomplished by either modifying current protocols at the transport layer or by implementing new control algorithms at the application layer irrespective of the protocol used at the transport layer. The objective of this research is to improve the QoS delivered to end-users in real-time applications transported over best-effort packet-switched networks. This is accomplished using UDP at the transport layer, along with adaptive predictive and reactive control at the application layer. An end-to-end fluid model is used, including the source buffer, the network and the destination buffer. Traditional control techniques, along with more advanced adaptive predictive control methods, are considered in order to provide the desirable QoS and make a best-effort network an attractive channel for interactive multimedia applications. The effectiveness of the control methods, is examined using a Simulink-based fluid-level simulator in combination with trace files extracted from the well-known network simulator ns- 2. The results show that improvement in real-time applications transported over best-effort networks using unreliable transport protocols, such as UDP, is feasible.

This research work aims to execute a financial model template using MICROSOFT EXCEL PROGRAM which can be applied on any industry to check its profitability. Two configurations for aromatics production had been considered {{as a case study}} for model application, Configuration I for the production of benzene, toluene and xylenes and Configuration II for the production of benzene and para xylene only based on 3 million tons of straight run naphtha feedstock.

40|$|Oceanic motion outside thin {{boundary}} layers {{is primarily}} a mixture of quasi-geostrophic flow and internal waves with either near-inertial frequencies or {{the frequency of the}} semidiurnal lunar tide. This dissertation seeks a deeper understanding of waves and flow through reduced models that isolate their nonlinear and coupled evolution from the Boussinesq equations. Three physical-space models are developed: an equation that describes quasi-geostrophic evolution in an arbitrary and prescribed field of hydrostatic internal waves; a three-component model that couples quasi-geostrophic flow to both near-inertial waves and the near-inertial second harmonic; and a model for the slow evolution of hydrostatic internal tides in quasi-geostrophic flow of near-arbitrary scale. This slow internal tide equation opens the path to a coupled model for the energetic interaction of quasi-geostrophic flow and oceanic internal tides. Four results emerge. First, the wave-averaged quasi-geostrophic equation reveals that finite-amplitude waves give rise to a mean flow that advects quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity. Second is the definition of a new material invariant: Available Potential Vorticity, or APV. APV isolates the part of Ertel potential vorticity available for balanced-flow evolution in Eulerian frames and proves necessary in the separating waves and quasi-geostrophic flow. The third result, hashed out for near-inertial waves and quasi-geostrophic flow, is that wave-flow interaction leads to energy exchange even under conditions of weak nonlinearity. For storm-forced oceanic near-inertial waves the interaction often energizes waves at the <b>expense</b> of <b>flow.</b> We call this extraction of balanced quasi-geostrophic energy `stimulated generation' since it requires externally-forced rather than spontaneously-generated waves. The fourth result is that quasi-geostrophic flow can encourage or `catalyze' a nonlinear interaction between a near-inertial wave field and its second harmonic that transfers energy to the small near-inertial vertical scales of wave breaking and mixing...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the sustainability of alternative cropping systems in the Brown and Dark Brown soil zones of Saskatchewan. Three components of sustainability are examined; economic effects, environmental effects and social acceptance. The primary objective of this project is to investigate the short and long-term economic effects of introducing pulses and oilseeds into existing cereal crop rotations. Representative farms were developed and used in the assessment of profitability and risk for four competing alternative rotations including a cereal based benchmark system. Production costs, financial linkages and stochastic prices and yields are used to simulate farm income, <b>expenses,</b> cash <b>flows</b> and net worth for a 15 year period. Stochastic dominance testing is used to determine the profitability and risk for each of the competing rotations based on annualized net returns. The second objective was to identify the change in soil productivity and resource use efficiency from the widespread use of these new cropping systems. The EPIC model is used to simulate a 30 year cropping pattern for each of the alternative crop rotations. The simulation results indicate that there are rotational benefits in short-term off-site resource usage. The results of the whole farm production model support the following conclusions. (1) Rotations that include lentil, with low price and yield correlations, produce higher net farm income and lower have economic risk. (2) Market risk is reduced by increasing cropping diversity. (3) Production risk is highest in the early adoption phase. (4) There is a cost savings in nitrogen fertilizer usage for crop rotations that include lentil; however, this cost savings is diminished by increased chemical and equipment costs. (5) Extended rotations that include lentil and canola are preferred over 2 -year and 3 -year wheat-fallow rotations by risk averse producers in the Brown and Dark Brown soil zones...|$|R
