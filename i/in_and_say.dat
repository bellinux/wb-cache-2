"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] {{began as}} two {{different}} demos, one variously called [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] and [...] "69" [...] (which eventually {{evolved into the}} B-side [...] "Lady with the Spinning Head") and an alternately arranged demo called [...] "Light My Way". Over {{the course of the}} recording sessions, U2 added various overdubs to the song, but producer Brian Eno believed these additions negatively impacted the track. Eno aided the group in editing down the song, and he explained his assistance as such: [...] "I'd go <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'The song has gone, whatever it is you liked about this song is not there anymore. Sometimes, for example, the song would have disappeared under layers of overdubs." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 {{lecture at}} Harvard after Jackson's trial, Jackson's {{attorney}} Thomas Mesereau said the following about Jordan Chandler: [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get}} him to show up and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were going to come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] In 2006, Jordan accused Evan of attacking him with a barbell, choking him and spraying his face with Mace. The charges were later dropped. On November 5, 2009, fourteen weeks after Jackson's death, Evan Chandler was found dead following an apparent suicide.|$|E
500|$|The People v. Jackson {{trial began}} in Santa Maria, California, on January 31, 2005. During the trial, the judge allowed {{testimony}} about past allegations, including the 1993 case, to establish whether the defendant had a propensity to commit certain crimes. However, Jordan Chandler {{had left the}} country to avoid testifying. In a lecture at Harvard after the trial, Thomas Mesereau said, [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get him}} to show up and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were going to come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] June Chandler testified that she had npt spoken to her son in 11 years. At one point in her testimony, she claimed that she could not remember being sued by Jackson (who had counter-sued for extortion) and at another point said that she had never heard of her own attorney. However, she said she never witnessed any molestation.|$|E

500|$|Producer Kevin Shirley {{was brought}} in {{on the advice of}} Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry. [...] As Rich explained, [...] "We really wanted to work with someone who can come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'That's not good.'... If Kevin says {{something}} I disagree with, he'll {{be the first one to}} say, 'Hey, it's your song,' but it's healthy for me and Chris to have him come in and be as excited about our songs as we are and say, 'Okay, that's cool, but what if we tried this?'" [...] At his first meeting with the band, Shirley described the songs played for him as having [...] "the same old jammy, shuffle feel of the last two records. [...] I stopped them then and I said to them... 'You've got to feel like you're teenagers again. You need a song like that.'" [...] Shirley's prompting led the band to write [...] "Kickin' My Heart Around" [...] on the spot, before he had signed on to produce. [...] Rich agreed that Shirley shifted the focus to making [...] "a rock record" [...] that was [...] "focused and concise".|$|E
500|$|Woodhouse had {{a history}} of theft, robbery and affray, and said that he had [...] "fallen out of love" [...] with football. He {{admitted}} to have been involved in around 100 street fights. He said; [...] "Boxing has always been my first love, even as a kid", and [...] "I love fighting...Rather than get locked up for it, I might as well get paid for it." [...] He also stated that he used to spar in the boxing gym after football training without his manager's knowledge, saying [...] "A few times at Sheffield United, Neil Warnock would drag me <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> ‘I hear you’ve been boxing’. I’d be standing there with a big black eye and a fat lip and deny it." [...] He trained under former British featherweight champion, Gary De Roux, and made his boxing debut on 8 September 2006 at Grosvenor House Hotel, London, in a welterweight contest against Dean Marcantonio, despite not having any previous amateur experience. The former footballer had lost two stone in weight since his playing days with Grimsby Town. The fight was scheduled for four rounds of two minutes, Woodhouse knocked his opponent down twice in the final round and won on points.|$|E
500|$|The National Black Police Association {{opposed the}} boycott of Time-Warner and {{the attacks on}} [...] "Cop Killer," [...] {{identifying}} police brutality {{as the cause of}} much anti-police sentiment, and proposed the creation of independent civilian review boards [...] "to scrutinize the actions of our law enforcement officers" [...] as a way of ending the provocations that caused artists such as Body Count [...] "to respond to actions of police brutality and abuse through their music. [...] Many individuals of the law enforcement profession do not want anyone to scrutinize their actions, but want to scrutinize the actions of others." [...] Critics argued that the song could cause crime and violence. Others defended the album {{on the basis of the}} group's right to freedom of speech, and cited the fact that Ice-T had portrayed a police officer in the film New Jack City. Ice-T is quoted as saying that [...] "I didn't need people to come in and really back me on the First Amendment. I needed people to come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> 'Ice-T has grounds to make this record.' I have the right to make it because the cops are killing my people. So fuck the First Amendment, let's deal with the fact that I have the right to make it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jordan Chandler, who was 25 at {{the time}} of the trial, chose to leave the country rather than testify, and the only person in his family who {{appeared}} for questioning was his mother, June. She denied having seen any molestation, but talked about Jordan and Michael sleeping in the same room on numerous occasions, explaining that she initially didn't want them to, but was persuaded by Jackson, who had cried and been hurt that she didn't trust him. She testified about Jackson buying all kinds of gifts for the family, the trips they'd been on together, and how fun it was to be part of Jackson's world. She said she'd been concerned that her son was starting to dress like Jackson and wanting to spend all his time with him. When asked about the lawsuits that resulted from her family's involvement with Michael Jackson, June Chandler made the distinction that even though she was listed as a plaintiff and received settlement money, it was not she who sued Jackson, but rather Jordan and his father Evan who did so. [...] She claimed not to recall that Jackson had counter sued for extortion, or that her second husband, Dave Schwartz, had sued Jackson, or that Evan Chandler had sued Jackson a second time. Thomas Mesereau said in a Harvard lecture later that year, [...] "the prosecutors tried to get [...] to show up, and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were going to come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] June Chandler testified that she had not spoken to her son Jordan in 11 years, since 1994.|$|E
