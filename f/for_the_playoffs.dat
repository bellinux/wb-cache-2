For the third season in four, the Senators played off against the Penguins in the first round.

5|$|As the New York Islanders {{failed to}} qualify <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> in Tavares' rookie {{season in the}} NHL, he was {{selected}} to the Canadian men's team for the 2010 IIHF World Championship in Germany. Canada General Manager Mark Messier made a specific effort to assemble a young team; as a result, Tavares was one of five teenagers on the final roster.

He helped Canada to the quarterfinal against Russia, where they were defeated 5–2.|$|E
5|$|At first distraught at leaving Montreal, Dutton quickly {{adapted to}} playing in New York.

5|$|Burrows had a forgettable 2013–14 season, scoring only 5 {{goals and}} 10 assists. In 49 games played, {{he did not}} score until game 36, where he potted two goals against the Winnipeg Jets. His 15 points on the year were the third-lowest of his career and his lowest since 2006–07. The 2013–14 season was also forgettable for the Canucks as a whole, as they failed to qualify <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> {{for the first time}} since 2007–08.|$|E

5|$|Having {{played the}} final year of his contract, Kariya agreed on a new three-year deal with the Ducks, {{reported}} to be worth between $32 and $33 million, during the ensuing summer. The contract was signed on June 30, 1999, one day before he was set to become a restricted free agent. In the three seasons that ensued, Kariya's offensive production decreased, a period that coincided with the Mighty Ducks failing to qualify <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> each year.|$|E
5|$|His {{contract}} having expired {{following the}} season, Johnson was a hold-out when the Rangers opened their training camp {{prior to the}} 1929–30 NHL season as the team was reluctant to meet his demands for increased pay. When the impasse dragged into November, he threatened to quit the game altogether, before finally agreeing to a new three-year deal. He appeared in 30 games for the Rangers that season, but again missed significant time, this time suffering a broken jaw. Again, Johnson returned in time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs,</b> but was forced to wear a steel mask to protect his face.|$|E

He was shut down, and the team announced he would not be available <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>playoffs</b> and would have surgery to repair the problem.
