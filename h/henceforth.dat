5|$|As per a {{new title}} {{sponsorship}} deal with Shaw Communications announced in May 2015, {{the event will}} <b>henceforth</b> {{be known as the}} Grey Cup presented by Shaw.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{took his}} pledge to reform {{executive}} appointments seriously, visiting {{each of the}} six executive departments to observe its operations and issuing through Webster an order to all departments that electioneering by employees would <b>henceforth</b> be considered grounds for dismissal.|$|E
5|$|On 13 June 1940 {{the ringing}} of church bells was banned; <b>henceforth</b> they would only be rung by the {{military}} or the police to warn that an invasion—generally meaning by parachutists—was in progress.|$|E
5|$|The NAIT is <b>henceforth</b> a range {{extended}} {{across its}} three series – the entry-level 'i Series', XS, and Classic series. The three units all share a styling, but {{the height of}} the case increases for the higher models.|$|E
5|$|When Josepha Petrick began {{painting}} for Mbantua Gallery in central Australia, she indicated {{that her name}} was Josepha rather than Josie, {{and that this was}} how she <b>henceforth</b> wished to be known; however Mbantua's biography is the only source that has used that version of her name.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the revolt}} was also fuelled by a general feeling of discontent and humiliation at the {{failures}} of the Angeloi, especially in terms of foreign policy. This much is evident from the— albeit embellished— account of the eyewitness Nicholas Mesarites, whereby John Komnenos's supporters proclaimed that <b>henceforth</b> everything would go well for Romania, that her enemies would be vanquished, and that the kings of all the earth would come to pay homage to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Since, O Lord, almighty {{and most}} merciful God, thou hast {{satisfied}} us with thy gifts, ensure from <b>henceforth</b> {{that we may}} diligently regard what thou wishest to be done or left undone by us and cause this to be effected with sincere heart, through Jesus Christ our Lord.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim {{conquest of}} Sicily began in June 827 and lasted until 902, {{when the last}} major Byzantine stronghold on the island, Taormina, fell. Isolated fortresses {{remained}} in Byzantine hands until 965, but the island was <b>henceforth</b> under Muslim rule until conquered in turn by the Normans in the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|The Zana-tompo (or Andriantompokoindrindra) {{were also}} {{considered}} elders, and Andriamasinavalona decreed that kings would <b>henceforth</b> select {{their wives and}} royal food tasters from among this caste. The rites pertaining to circumcision were another honor reserved for the Zana-tompo. The king decreed that they should inhabit the countryside south of the capital extending from Ambavahadimitafo southward to Ambatolampy. Outside of Antananarivo, the Zana-tompo lived {{in the village of}} Ambohimalaza.|$|E
5|$|The move to {{functional}} classification {{coincided with the}} rise of sports science. The first detailed international swimming sport science project was conducted at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. This was followed by a similar project at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona. These studies provided an increasingly detailed understanding of the factors involved in high performance swimming. <b>Henceforth</b> sports science became the driver of both performance and classification.|$|E
5|$|The {{suppression}} of Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt signalled {{the end of}} the power of the tribal nobility of Iraq, which <b>henceforth</b> came under the direct control of the Umayyad regime's staunchly loyal Syrian troops. Later revolts, under Yazid ibn al-Muhallab and Zayd ibn Ali, also failed, and it was not until the success of the Abbasid Revolution that the Syrian dominance of Iraq was broken.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, {{displaying}} the personal initiative that would characterize his later career, seized Paducah, Kentucky, a major transportation hub of rail and port facilities {{at the mouth}} of the Tennessee River. <b>Henceforth,</b> neither adversary respected Kentucky's proclaimed neutrality, and the Confederate advantage was lost. The buffer zone that Kentucky provided between the North and the South was no longer available to assist in the defense of Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|With {{the removal}} of Constantine VI, Irene <b>henceforth</b> reigned alone, the first Byzantine empress to do so. Staurakios, however, found his own {{position}} increasingly challenged by another powerful eunuch and trusted servant of the empress, Aetios. Both were engaged in an intense rivalry to place their relatives {{in positions of power}} so as to secure control of the Empire after Irene's death.|$|E
5|$|Adi Da {{initially}} {{became known}} in the spiritual counterculture of the 1970s for his books and public talks, and for the activities of his religious community. His philosophy was essentially similar to many eastern religions which see spiritual enlightenment as the ultimate priority of human life. Distinguishing his from other religious traditions, Adi Da declared {{that he was a}} uniquely historic avatar (incarnation of a god or divinity in human form). As such, Adi Da stated that <b>henceforth</b> devotional worship of him would be the sole means of spiritual enlightenment for anyone else.|$|E
5|$|After {{completion}} of the Wood Badge course, participants are awarded the insignia in a Wood Badge bead ceremony. They receive automatic membership in 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group or Gilwell Troop 1. These leaders are <b>henceforth</b> called Gilwellians or Wood Badgers. It is estimated that worldwide over 100,000 Scouters have completed their Wood Badge training. The 1st Gilwell Scout Group meets annually during the first weekend in September at Gilwell Park for the Gilwell Reunion. Gilwell Reunions are also held in other places, often on that same weekend.|$|E
5|$|After the {{withdrawal}} from the Kingdom of Hungary, the Mongol forces halted at Sarai (now Russia) on the Volga River where their leader, Batu Khan set up his own capital. <b>Henceforth,</b> the steppes between the rivers Dnieper and Danube were {{under the influence of}} the Mongols of the Volga, known as the Golden Horde. From the 1260s, a relative of Batu, Nogai Khan settled at Isaccea on the Lower Danube and became the absolute master of the neighboring regions. He made himself independent of the Golden Horde around 1280, but was killed in a battle in 1299.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{advanced}} on Egypt {{in later}} 332BC, {{where he was}} regarded as a liberator. He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert. <b>Henceforth,</b> Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father, and after his death, currency depicted him adorned with rams horn as a symbol of his divinity. During his stay in Egypt, he founded Alexandria-by-Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom after his death.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Hogan {{had begun}} to lose the trustees' support. At some point soon thereafter, he left the city. In the hope of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell {{partially}} capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments. In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church. The bishop would <b>henceforth</b> appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.|$|E
5|$|Following Against All Odds, Team 3D {{were forced}} to weigh in before each contest, which created a feud with the team of Curry Man and Shark Boy, leading to a Fish Market Street Fight between the two teams, with the {{stipulation}} that if Team 3D could not make weight they would be fired from TNA. At the event, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that if Team 3D made weight that night {{they would not have}} to abide by a weight restriction <b>henceforth.</b> Team 3D marked in below the mark prior to the contest; however eventually lost the encounter.|$|E
5|$|Following Oppenheimer's {{reorganization}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, {{the work on the}} uranium gun-type weapon was concentrated in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched uranium could be used. <b>Henceforth</b> the gun-type had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called Little Boy.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the impact}} was {{far greater than}} anyone on the Allied side realised, and the ramifications went far beyond New Guinea. Imperial General Headquarters had {{regarded}} the defeats in the Guadalcanal Campaign and Battle of Buna–Gona as setbacks only, and had continued to plan offensives in the South West Pacific. Now it concluded that the Japanese position was over-extended. A new defensive line was drawn running through Western New Guinea, the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands. <b>Henceforth,</b> positions beyond that line would be held as an outpost line. General Imamura was now charged not with winning a decisive victory, but only with holding on {{as long as possible}} so as to delay the Allied advance.|$|E
5|$|In 1560 {{the diplomat}} Nicholas Throckmorton {{advocated}} vehemently against Dudley marrying the Queen, but Dudley won him over in 1562. Throckmorton <b>henceforth</b> became his political advisor and intimate. After Throckmorton's death in 1571 there quickly evolved a political {{alliance between the}} Earl of Leicester and Sir Francis Walsingham, soon to be Secretary of State. Together they worked for a militant Protestant foreign policy. There also existed a family relationship between them after Walsingham's daughter had married Philip Sidney, Leicester's favourite nephew. Leicester, after some initial jealousy, also became {{a good friend of}} Sir Christopher Hatton, himself one of Elizabeth's favourites.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, the Madras University Act {{was passed}} after its {{introduction}} by Education Minister A. P. Patro. Under the bill's provisions, the governing body of Madras University was completely reorganised on democratic lines. The bill {{asserted that the}} governing body would <b>henceforth</b> be headed by a Chancellor who would be assisted by a pro-Chancellor, usually the Minister of Education. Apart from the Chancellor and the pro-Chancellor who were elected, {{there was to be}} a Vice-Chancellor appointed by the Chancellor.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Riverkeeper was alerted of a sewage leak in the kill, noting {{high levels}} of {{bacteria}} indicating the presence of fecal matter. A New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) investigation found nearby private sewer pipes and manholes {{to be filled with}} sludge; they were cleaned and plans have been instated to ensure that sewers would stay clear <b>henceforth.</b> An oil spill was observed in the kill in 2016 and DEC staff were again sent to respond. The DEC installed booms to absorb the oil and began an investigation into the spill's source, which was unknown as of December 6.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. The concept was pursued so that {{in case of a}} failure to develop a plutonium bomb, it would still be possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design <b>henceforth</b> had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted. The simplified weapon was short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Arab conquests during the 7th century, the whole administrative and military system of the Empire was reformed, and the thematic system established. According to this, the Empire was divided into several themata, which were regional civil and military administrations. Under the command of a stratēgos, each thema maintained its own, locally levied forces. Following a series of revolts by thematic forces, under Constantine V the larger early themes were progressively broken up, while a central imperial army, the tagmata, was created, stationed at or near Constantinople, serving as a central reserve that <b>henceforth</b> formed the core of campaigning armies.|$|E
5|$|Lord Granville died {{in early}} 1846, having never {{recovered}} from a stroke he suffered five years previously. He was buried at Stone, Staffordshire. His death desolated his wife. She lived <b>henceforth</b> in complete retirement, residing chiefly at Chiswick House, where she turned to piety for consolation. Her contacts {{in the outside world}} were chiefly her children and step-children, her brother William, and the children of her sister Georgiana. She survived her husband by fifteen years, dying on 25 November 1862 of a stroke at her London home at 13 Hereford Street.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March, the Alsos Mission reached Heidelberg, where {{important}} {{scientists were}} captured including Walther Bothe, Richard Kuhn, Philipp Lenard, and Wolfgang Gertner. Their interrogation revealed that Otto Hahn {{was at his}} laboratory in Tailfingen, while Werner Heisenberg and Max von Laue were at Heisenberg's laboratory in Hechingen, and the experimental natural uranium reactor that Heisenberg's team had built in Berlin had been moved to Haigerloch. <b>Henceforth,</b> {{the main focus of}} the Alsos Mission was on these nuclear facilities in the Württemberg area.|$|E
5|$|On April 12, 1865, Booth {{heard the}} news that Robert E. Lee had {{surrendered}} at Appomattox Court House. He told Louis J. Weichmann, a friend of John Surratt and a boarder at Mary Surratt's house, that he {{was done with the}} stage and that the only play he wanted to present <b>henceforth</b> was Venice Preserv'd. Weichmann did not understand the reference; Venice Preserv'd is about an assassination plot. Booth's scheme to kidnap Lincoln was no longer feasible with the Union Army's capture of Richmond and Lee's surrender, and he changed his goal to assassination.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 1972, Lunney {{was given}} overall {{responsibility}} for the test project; <b>henceforth</b> {{he would be in}} charge not only of building a partnership with the Soviets, but also of mission planning and of negotiating with North American Rockwell, the spacecraft contractor. According to the official history of the ASTP, Lunney's performance during Apollo 13 and during the Soviet negotiations had recommended him to Chris Kraft, who was by then director of Johnson Space Center. In 1973, Lunney became manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, a position which gave him {{responsibility for the}} Apollo spacecraft used during Skylab missions, as well giving him more authority in his role as head of the ASTP.|$|E
5|$|Resolved {{and ordered}} by this Board—That the old seal of this corporation, {{now in the}} hands of the Mayor, be changed and altered, and that there be a new seal in its place, which new seal, being now {{produced}} to this board and approved of by them, the same is ordered to be lodged in the hands of our present clerk in his office for the use and behoof of this corporation, and that the present now new seal be <b>henceforth</b> our seal and called, deemed and esteemed the common seal of this corporation until it be altered and changed and the aforesaid former seal be null and void and dead in law to all intents and purposes whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|The College of Arms {{is also an}} {{authorised}} {{location for}} enrolling a change of name. In common law there is no obligation to undergo any particular formality to change one's name. However, {{it is possible to}} execute a deed poll, more specifically a deed of change of name, as a demonstration of intention to adopt and <b>henceforth</b> use a new name, and deeds poll may be enrolled either in the High Court or in the College. On being enrolled the deed is customarily 'gazetted', that is published in the London Gazette. The deed poll is not entered on the registers, but is still published, if the name change only affects one's given name.|$|E
5|$|The Madras University Act {{was passed}} in the year 1923. The bill was {{introduced}} by Education Minister Sir A. P. Patro. As per the provisions of this bill, the governing body of the Madras University was completely reorganised on democratic lines. The bill asserted that the governing body would <b>henceforth</b> be headed by a Chancellor who would be assisted by a pro-Chancellor who was usually the Minister of Education. Apart from the Chancellor and the pro-Chancellor who were elected, {{there was to be}} a Vice-Chancellor appointed by the Chancellor. In 1925, the Andhra University Act was passed which included similar reforms in Andhra University.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} ended soon after, in {{an effective}} stalemate and a formal compromise: a Parthian prince of the Arsacid line would <b>henceforth</b> {{sit on the}} Armenian throne, but his nomination had {{to be approved by}} the Roman emperor. This conflict was the first direct confrontation between Parthia and the Romans since Crassus' disastrous expedition and Mark Antony's campaigns a century earlier, and would be the first of a long series of wars between Rome and Iranian powers over Armenia (see Roman–Persian Wars).|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} {{reaction to}} this latest turn of events was varied and greatly colored by national interests. The British were unwilling to defend Madagascar's sovereignty for fear that the French might retaliate and fail to recognize the British claim to certain protectorates of its own. All official British engagement with Madagascar was <b>henceforth</b> transacted through the French resident, but these communiques were not officially recognized by Ranavalona and her court. The United States and Germany, on the other hand, continued to deal directly with the queen's government as the rightful authority in Madagascar. This discrepancy forced a reinterpretation of {{one aspect of the}} treaty, resulting in the queen's authority over internal affairs being maintained.|$|E
5|$|The {{operations}} became sizeable {{during the}} last quarter of the nineteenth century. Smith died in 1879, leaving an estate valued at under £45,000 (around £4.1 million in 2016 adjusted for inflation), and his assets were jointly inherited by his two brothers, William and Samuel Smith (a tanner). William purchased Samuel's share of his brother's personal estate, and built a modern brewery in 1883–4 at the cost of £130,000 (£9.7 million in 2013). By this time the company had a staff of over 100. William Smith died in 1886, and the firm was inherited in partnership by his two nephews, Henry Herbert (1863–1911) and Frank Riley, <b>henceforth</b> known as Riley-Smith under the terms of his will.|$|E
