[...] The article, featured on the Yahoo! website Shine, also criticized the books and the author's final word on the series was, [...] "Good books deal with themes of longing and loneliness, sexual passion and human frailty, alienation and fear just as the Twilight books do.

500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, writing [...] "Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka {{may be a}} stone freak, but he is {{also one}} of Burton's classic crackpot conjurers, like Beetlejuice or Ed Wood." [...] Roger Ebert gave an overall {{positive}} review and enjoyed the film. He was primarily impressed by Tim Burton's direction of the younger cast members, but was disappointed with Depp's performance: [...] "What was Depp thinking of? In [...] he was famously channeling Keith Richards, which may have primed us to look for possible inspirations for this performance." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle found Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Burton's [...] "best work in years. If all the laughs come from Depp, who gives Willy the mannerisms of a classic Hollywood diva, the film's heart comes from Highmore, a gifted young performer whose performance is sincere, deep and unforced in a way that's rare in a child actor." [...] Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone magazine that [...] "Depp's deliciously demented take on Willy Wonka demands to be seen. Depp goes deeper to find the bruises on Wonka's secret heart than what Gene Wilder did. Depp and Burton may fly too high on the vapors of pure imagination, but it's hard to not <b>get</b> <b>hooked</b> on something this tasty. And how about that army of Oompa-Loompas, all played by Deep Roy, in musical numbers that appear to have been choreographed by Busby Berkeley on crack." ...|$|E
