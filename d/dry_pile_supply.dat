50|$|In 1809 {{he sent a}} long {{paper to}} the Royal Society on {{separating}} the chemical from the electrical effect of the <b>dry</b> <b>pile,</b> a form of Voltaic pile, {{with a description of}} the electric column and aerial electroscope, in which he advanced opinions contradicting the latest discoveries of the day; they were deemed inappropriate to admit into the Transactions. The dry column described by Deluc was constructed by various scientists and his improvement of the <b>dry</b> <b>pile</b> has been regarded as his most important work, although he was not in fact its inventor.

40|$|The {{collection}} of the Clarendon Laboratory in Oxford possesses a remarkable instrument that has been ringing almost continuously since it was purchased from Watkins & Hill of London in 1840 (figure 1). 1 A tiny brass clapper suspended by a silk fibre moves to and fro between the bells attached {{to the base of}} two vertical pillars, known as “dry piles”. These are connected in series, sealed in a coating of sulphur, and housed under a glass dome to keep out the dust. Its fame has secured it a place in the Guinness Book of Records. This device closely resembles the one described by George John Singer in his textbook of 1814 (figure 3). 2 The <b>dry</b> <b>pile,</b> although it became to be regarded as a novelty, also had its brief moment of glory in the debate concerning the relationship between “classical ” high-tension electrostatic experiments and Volta’s low-tension experiments with the voltaic pile. The debate over the <b>dry</b> <b>pile</b> highlights the nature of scientific evidence and the key role of instruments in this debate. 2. The Origins of the <b>Dry</b> <b>Pile</b> The <b>dry</b> <b>pile</b> grew out of the debate between those that ascribed the electrical behaviour of the “wet ” voltaic pile either to “contact tension ” (the “Volta effect”) or “chemical action”. Helge Kragh and Nahum Kipnis have described in detail this lengthy controversy with its ramifications in the first 3 and in the present volume of the Nuova Voltiana series. Instrumental evidence figured largely in this debate, as it did in Volta’s original discovery of his pile. A key aspect that made the contact theory popular was that it kept the explanation of the pile in familiar territory, that is, in terms of the high-tension static electricity of the phenomena associated with the frictional electrical machine. In thes...|$|R

50|$|In 1887, a fire struck. On June 27, after a dry three weeks, fire {{broke out}} among the <b>drying</b> <b>piles</b> in the Upham mill's lumberyard, ignited by a spark from a train.

Men {{tried to stop the}} inferno, even dynamiting stores to create a fire break, but the updraft lifted embers and dropped them onto more buildings. When it was over, 250 buildings were destroyed, but no lives were lost. The next day, Upham announced he would rebuild his businesses. Neighbors in Stevens Point, Spencer and Wisconsin Rapids sent trainloads of supplies. The city ruled that buildings on Central should henceforth be built from brick, even though Marshfield had been largely built on wealth generated by lumber.|$|R
50|$|The {{experiment}} {{consists of}} two brass bells, each positioned beneath a <b>dry</b> <b>pile</b> (a form of battery), the pair of piles connected in series. The clapper is a metal sphere approximately 4 mm in diameter suspended between the piles, which rings the bells alternately due to electrostatic force. As the clapper touches one bell, it is charged by one pile, and then electrostatically repelled, being attracted to the other bell. On hitting the other bell, the process repeats. The use of electrostatic forces means that while high voltage is required to create motion, only a tiny amount of charge is carried from one bell to the other, {{which is why the}} piles have been able to last since the apparatus was set up. Its oscillation frequency is 2 hertz.|$|R
5000|$|Zamboni {{is known}} to {{students}} of physics for an improved version of the <b>dry</b> <b>pile</b> (an electric battery which does not use an electrolyte) which he invented in 1812. It consists {{of a number of}} paper discs coated with zinc foil on one side and manganese dioxide on the other; the moisture of the paper serves as a conductor. By pressing a large number of such discs together in a glass tube, an electromotive force can be obtained that is sufficient to deflect the leaves of an ordinary electroscope. By bringing the terminal knobs of the pile near each other and suspending a light brass ball between them, Zamboni devised what was called an electrostatic clock. The device is so named because the ball oscillating between the knobs looks like a pendulum.|$|R
