40|$|Multiple aneurysms occur rarely {{and have}} not been well investigated. The {{purpose of this study}} is to verify whether high rupture risk of {{multiple}} aneurysms is due to the interaction between multiple aneurysms’ <b>geometrical</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The following <b>geometrical</b> <b>characteristics</b> were varied in an idealized sidewall-type model: aneurysm a 1 ’s dome-neck length (S), size ratio, inflow angle (α), distance between two aneurysms (D), and the parent vessel’s angle (θ). We varied the parent blood vessel and aneurysm sac a 1 ’s <b>geometrical</b> <b>characteristics</b> to analyze their hemodynamic influence on aneurysm a 2. By comparing the influence on aneurysm a 2, we found that parent blood vessel <b>geometrical</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as the distance between aneurysms (D) and the parent vessel’s angle (θ) were the most hemodynamically influential characteristics examined. The impact of varying the aneurysm’s <b>geometrical</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as dome-neck length (S), size ratio, and inflow angle (α) was not obvious. The reason for the higher rupture rate of multiple aneurysms is not due to interactions between the aneurysm sacs but due to factors of each individual aneurysm...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>geometrical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of {{quasi-static}} fractures in disordered media, using iterated conformal maps {{to determine the}} evolution of the fracture pattern. This method allows an efficient and accurate solution of the Lamé equations without resorting to lattice models. Typical fracture patterns exhibit increased ramification due to the increase of the stress at the tips. We find the roughness exponent of the experimentally relevant backbone of the fracture pattern; it crosses over from about 0. 5 for small scales to about 0. 75 for large scales, in excellent agreement with experiments. We propose that this cross-over reflects the increased ramification of the fracture pattern. Comment: submitted to Physical Review Letter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{geometrical}} {{approach to}} investigation of Lagrange spectrum over finite fields, i. e. {{for the real}} numbers whose continues fraction expansions contain coefficients from a fixed finite set of natural numbers, is proposed.
