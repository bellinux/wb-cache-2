25|$|Hercules was out {{of service}} after the Burmarsh Road level {{crossing}} incident in 2003, and Samson was withdrawn from service for an <b>intermediate</b> <b>overhaul</b> shortly afterwards. Once both locomotives were back in service, the railway {{was faced with a}} tender shortage. Samson was kept from mainline service while Hercules was coupled to the tender from Green Goddess while it was stored prior to overhaul. During the 2007 season, Samson saw service using the tender from Hurricane while it was being overhauled (a situation that had also happened in 1949 when Samson was used for ballast train duties).|$|E
2500|$|Tornado was repainted at Southall into BR express {{passenger}} blue; {{this was}} unveiled at Didcot on 24 November 2012. Other preserved locomotives painted in this livery include 4498 Sir Nigel Gresley and 6023 King Edward II. In October 2014, Tornado {{was taken out}} of service for an <b>intermediate</b> <b>overhaul</b> and went [...] back to operational wearing its original LNER-style express passenger apple green livery once again in June 2015.|$|E

50|$|The real {{strength}} of the A1 and A2 classes lay in their reliability. By carefully incorporating the best of Gresley and Thompson design, as well as ideas of his own, Peppercorn had produced two masterpieces of durability and low service cost. Five of the A1s had roller bearings fitted throughout, and they regularly covered 150,000 miles between <b>intermediate</b> <b>overhauls.</b> Even the plain bearing A1s were capable of 90,000 miles between overhauls, and no other express passenger locomotive class in the UK could better 80,000. The first of his A2 engines had single chimneys, and when fitted with self-cleaning smoke-boxes experienced steaming problems which took some time to resolve. Changing to double blast-pipe resolved much of the issues, {{though some of the}} A2s retained single chimney without self-cleaning apparatus. The A1s, being built afterwards, and incorporating the lessons learned, featured the double blast-pipe and chimney from new.|$|R
500|$|The {{first of}} four [...] riders to start within the final twenty-five riders, Chris Froome got within eight seconds of Kelderman's time, {{but it was not}} until another of the team's riders, Michael Rogers, that the lead changed hands. Although he trailed at the first <b>intermediate</b> point, Rogers <b>overhauled</b> the time of Kelderman at the finish by {{fourteen}} seconds; he held the lead into the final five starters, where it was then taken by the world time trial champion Tony Martin, riding for the [...] team. Martin bettered the time of Rogers by 37 seconds, but it was not to last as Wiggins was cementing his overall lead. Wiggins made up a deficit of seven seconds to Martin at the first intermediate point, and turned it into a 36-second lead in the space of , eventually taking the stage victory by 34 seconds over Martin. Such was Wiggins' performance, which he later deemed [...] "satisfying", that he was almost catching Cadel Evans (...) on the road, despite Evans starting two minutes before Wiggins; Evans ultimately finished the stage in eighth position, 1' 43" [...] down on Wiggins' time. [...] rider Andy Schleck, another of the overall contenders for the Tour de France along with Evans and Wiggins, lost over ten minutes to Wiggins on the stage after a crash and a puncture.|$|R
