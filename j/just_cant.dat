He is frightened clear through, now, and he lays his long ears down on his back, straightens himself out like a yard-stick every spring he makes, and scatters miles behind him with an easy indifference that is enchanting.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhen 1789 comes, {{the older}} {{generation}} of French novelists let themselves {{be involved in the}} reformatory movement, abandoning their ‘literary duties’. Their younger colleagues are still too inexperienced to reach for a pen and describe the fast-changing reality they live in; for this they will need some temporal and/or spatial distance. Meanwhile, it turns out that what was once considered to be <b>just</b> a signifi <b>cant</b> evolution has now become a real, ultimate and all-changing Revolution. In such a ‘regenerated’ state there is no longer room for any remains of the hateful Ancien Régime. This is how the novel, as it developed during the eighteenth century, becomes one of the first victims of the new revolutionary taste and is now stigmatised as an emblem of the ci-devant depraved aristocratic society. A reformed theatre, political speeches and journalistic genres successfully supplant the novel, considered no longer capable of providing all citizens with the up-to-date information they need. Moreover, when in revolutionary France heads start to fall, at which point a promising reality begins to turn into a sanguinary nightmare, novelists seem intellectually paralysed and fi nd themselves suffering from a kind of ‘creative impotence’ that will not pass until the revolution has finished...|$|R

40|$|Hydrofoils {{have been}} applied to many {{different}} types of marine craft, including yachts. However, most of these have been for attempts at speed records or by inventors and, notably, the international Moth class, but so far not to modern racing yachts. They provide a number of advantages, and this project has investigated the feasibility of application to a modern canting-keel maxi yacht. The investigation began with drawing up a set of lines for a modern canting-keel maxi yacht. A resistance was then predicted, both with and without foils, using the Delft Systematic Yacht Series and a three-dimensional analysis of the foil-borne resistance. A towing rig was designed and constructed, and several models built and tested on open water and in a swimming pool to compare the resistance and performance, both with and without foils. Finally, a radio-controlled sailing model was constructed and tested, both with and without foils. The results showed a clear speed advantage for the foil-assisted maxi yacht. <b>Just</b> as with <b>canting</b> keels, fitting foils to an ocean-racing maxi will not be without its problems. However, the evidence is compelling, and it is considered {{only a matter of time}} before someone sets a precedent with a full-scale yacht, which others will follow...|$|R

5000|$|You <b>cant</b> <b>just</b> {{hold up a}} {{cross and}} expect a vampire to cower away—thats not real. Everything that people know classically about vampires is wrong, so that just gave us an {{opportunity}} to plant our own flag and create our own creature. Kripke on Supernaturals divergence from classical folklore. Although the weekly adversaries for the Winchesters were often based on urban legends, the writers tried to put their own spin on the stories for each of the episodes. For example, Kripke combined the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization in the pilot. The episode [...] "Hook Man", however, borrowed three or four elements from the numerous variations of the Hook Man legend. The figure is an escaped mental patient in the traditional myth, but the writers decided {{for the purposes of the}} show to make him the ghost of a hook-handed killer. They also added a poltergeist element by having him attached to the conflicting emotions of the guest star—she wears a cross made from his melted hook. Rather than focus on modern interpretations, Kripke and co-executive producer John Shiban decided that Supernaturals vampires would stem more from the original legends. The vampires were given retractable fangs—these were inspired by the rowed teeth of sharks—as well as no aversion to sunlight or the crucifix. Kripke personally added the fact that vampires would become weak if given the blood of a dead man.|$|R
60|$|These UNcommon counsellors, your Professor Owens and fellows, will {{contend that}} to {{tolerate}} {{these things in}} a civilised city, is to reduce it to a worse condition than BRUCE found to prevail in ABYSSINIA. For there (say they) the jackals and wild dogs came at night to devour the offal; whereas, here {{there are no such}} natural scavengers, and quite as savage customs. Further, they will demonstrate that nothing in Nature is intended to be wasted, and that besides the waste which such abuses occasion in the articles of health and life - main sources of the riches of any community - they lead to a prodigious waste of changing matters, which might, with proper preparation, and under scientific direction, be safely applied to the increase of the fertility of the land. Thus (they argue) does Nature ever avenge infractions of her beneficent laws, and so surely as Man is determined to warp any of her blessings into curses, shall they become curses, and shall he suffer heavily. But, this is <b>cant.</b> <b>Just</b> as it is cant of the worst description to say to the London Corporation, 'How can you exhibit to the people so plain a spectacle of dishonest equivocation, as to claim the right of holding a market {{in the midst of the}} great city, for one of your vested privileges, when you know that when your last market holding charter was granted to you by King Charles the First, Smithfield stood IN THE SUBURBS OF LONDON, and is in that very charter so described in those five words?' - which is certainly true, but has nothing to do with the question.|$|R
