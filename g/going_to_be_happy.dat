5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy.</b>|$|E
500|$|While the Windows and Xbox 360 {{versions}} of The Orange Box were developed {{and published by}} Valve, {{the development of the}} PlayStation 3 port was outsourced to Electronic Arts. In an interview with Edge magazine before the game's release, Valve co-founder Gabe Newell commented, [...] "I think the people who have The Orange Box on the PS3 are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> with their game experience. We've done the PC and 360 versions here and EA has a team doing the PS3 version– and they'll make the PS3 version a good product; EA got the job done in putting {{a lot of people with}} PS3 experience on the project. But I think it's harder to get it to the same standard as the 360 and PC versions". Despite this, he noted that Valve will probably handle PlayStation 3 {{versions of}} its products in the future.|$|E
500|$|The Philadelphia Inquirer {{highlighted}} Cyber Rights among [...] "1998's Best Reading", and concluded, [...] "Often reads, as Godwin intends, as a handbook for free-speech activism". A {{review in}} the San Antonio Express-News concluded, [...] "'Cyber Rights' is an extremely important book, one that anyone who accesses the Internet should read. Those who support the causes Godwin fights against aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> with it, because he pokes some big holes in their arguments. But one of the bedrock freedoms we all enjoy is freedom of speech, and Godwin makes an elegant defense in its behalf." [...] The Dallas Morning News characterized the book as a multifacted legal instructive work, and commented, [...] "Part philosophical musings, part legal primer, part history and part political analysis, the book touches on just about every facet of how the Internet is transforming free-speech issues." [...] The Houston Chronicle wrote, [...] "Godwin makes a passionate case for ensuring the online world has the same civil rights as the 'real' world." [...] Writing in the book Internet and the Law, author Aaron Schwabach comments, [...] "The book takes an anticensorship position, but it presents {{all sides of the}} various questions fairly and completely." ...|$|E

500|$|Rater {{noted that}} the balance Meredith had just found in her life, finally having a chance at {{happiness}} with the man she loves, is shaken by her mother's unexpected lucidity, which was stated to have been written in the series in order to remind Meredith about the troubled years of her growing up: [...] "If Meredith is ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy,</b> she's {{got to deal with}} the fact that she had a really terrible childhood." [...] In addition, Rater explained that Ellis' [...] "awful, raw, ugly and terrible" [...] statements towards her daughter were intended to make everyone realize the reason behind Meredith's alcoholism in college and her continuous one-night stands with inappropriate men. She also deemed Pompeo's performance in the episode [...] "exceptional", describing what she regarded an [...] "exceptional moment" [...] which sees Meredith stand up to her mother. In response to the scene that sees Ellis interacting with Webber, Rater wrote that it is the first time she lets her guard down, exposing the previously hidden vulnerability, which allows her express the desire to be as happy and ordinary as her daughter. She also praised the performances of the cast, by deeming their acting [...] "remarkable". [...] "That is really what it's all about. We have to cherish the time that we have here, and love the people who surround and support us, even if they make us crazy, because things happen. Brain surgery, Alzheimer's and weddings. And the worst thing is to come to the end of your life, and realize, like Ellis, that you should have tried harder", stated Rater, putting the emphasis on the main aspects of the episode, characterizing it as [...] "not ordinary".|$|E
2500|$|At Hermione's urging, Harry forms {{a secret}} student {{organisation}} called Dumbledore's Army to teach more meaningful defence {{against the dark}} arts as Professor Umbridge is making them read off a textbook. Their plan is thwarted, however, when a Dumbledore's Army member, Marietta Edgecombe, betrays them and informs Umbridge about the D.A., causing Dumbledore to be ousted as Headmaster. Harry suffers another emotional blow, when his beloved godfather, Sirius, is killed during a duel with Sirius' cousin, the Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange, at the Department of Mysteries, but Harry ultimately defeats Voldemort's plan to steal an important prophecy. Rowling stated: [...] "And now he [...] will rise from the ashes strengthened." [...] A side plot of Order of the Phoenix involves Harry's romance with Cho Chang, but the relationship quickly unravels. Says Rowling: [...] "They were never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy,</b> it was better that it ended early!" ...|$|E

The next year he gave a speech only women could attend. In his speech for women, as The New York Times reported, [...] "Mr. Farrakhan urged the women to embrace his formula for a successful family. He encouraged them to put husbands and children ahead of their careers, shun tight, short skirts, stay off welfare and reject abortion. He also {{stressed the importance of}} cooking and cleaning and urged women not to abandon homemaking for careers. 'You’re just not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> unless there is happiness in the home,' Mr. Farrakhan said at the Mason Cathedral Church of God in Christ in the Dorchester section, not far from the Roxbury neighborhood where he was raised by a single mother.

Tara also says Quasimodo had no moral compass and was selfishly motivated by love for a woman who couldn't love him back, a clear reference to Spike's demonic nature and unrequited love for Buffy.|$|R
