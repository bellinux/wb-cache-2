40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to address the {{overarching}} question, which was whether the incentives programmes formulated for the community have been found to be suitable to the aspirations and needs of the local residents. Design/methodology/approach – This study has resulted from the authors’ experience through conducting a survey with the local residents in three locations, namely the Bukchon Hanok Village located at Seoul metropolitan city; the Hahoe Village, Angdong and the Yangdong Village, Gyeongju; both the latter are located towards the west of the Korean peninsula in the Gyeongbuk-do Province. This study has hopefully tried to analyse the residents’ perception of the effectiveness of the current <b>incentives</b> <b>policy</b> by using the Bennett’s programme evaluation method. Findings – Results show that there was a divergent direction between the current <b>incentives</b> <b>policy</b> and the local aspirations between sites. In most cases, the cultural heritage conservation has been found to be a catalyst to fulfil a heritage tourism advantage rather than to cater to the local community needs. Originality/value – The paper is the first insightful study of the historic villages which attempts to draw out the importance of the effectiveness of the incentives programme in guiding the conservation efforts for the local economic development...|$|E

30|$|Based on {{available}} budget, Angelopoulos et al. [67 – 69] recommend several {{strategies to}} reward {{the effort of}} data contributors in mobile crowdsensing, including proportional <b>incentive</b> <b>policy,</b> participation-aware <b>incentive</b> <b>policy,</b> behavioural-aware <b>incentive</b> <b>policy,</b> location-aware <b>incentive</b> <b>policy,</b> mobility-aware <b>incentive</b> <b>policy,</b> thrifty <b>incentive</b> <b>policy</b> and quality-aware <b>incentive</b> <b>policy.</b> Proportional <b>incentive</b> <b>policy</b> advocates that for each task segment, incentive proportionate to the expected utility and the current residual budget be allocated, from which the effort of participants who have contributed data to the task segment can be rewarded accordingly [69]. Participation-aware <b>incentive</b> <b>policy</b> recommends that the efforts of data contributors be initially rewarded with high incentives in order to stimulate the crowd and attract a minimum percentage of participating agents [67]. Afterwards, the efforts of data contributors should be rewarded in a more conservative manner that {{is good enough to}} retain` existing participants, not necessarily attracting new ones [69]. Behavioural-aware <b>incentive</b> <b>policy</b> rewards participants based on historical records of their trustworthiness and commitment to the crowdsensing initiative [68]. Location-aware <b>incentive</b> <b>policy</b> selects participants by virtue of their locations or rewards participant’s effort according to the cost associated with the given location where data is captured while mobility-aware <b>incentive</b> <b>policy</b> rewards participant’s effort according to the frequency with which the user moves around the area of interest to capture data [68, 70]. Thrifty <b>incentive</b> <b>policy</b> aims at rewarding participants {{in such a way that}} ensures available budget is used prudently and resourcefully. Quality-aware <b>incentive</b> <b>policy</b> seeks to reward the efforts of participants in a manner that is proportionate to the quality of data contributed. The rationale for the quality-aware <b>incentive</b> <b>policy</b> is to attract high quality participants by offering higher amounts of incentive [67]. However, Jin et al. [71] and Wang et al. [72] propose quality-aware incentive mechanisms (QIMs) that strike a balance between quality and cost of data. These QIMs, which are based on reverse auctions, do not reward participants on the basis of just the quality of their data, but rather optimise the selection of participants by taking into consideration both the quality and the price of their data [71, 72].|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} bilevel {{optimization}} approach to designing {{effective and efficient}} <b>incentive</b> <b>policies</b> for promoting renewable energy. The effectiveness of an <b>incentive</b> <b>policy</b> is its capability to achieve a goal {{that would not be}} achievable without it.

The efficiency of an <b>incentive</b> <b>policy</b> is measured by the amount of intervention, such as taxes collected and subsidies paid, to achieve the policy goal.

40|$|Government, in Saudi Arabia, {{has been}} the {{dominant}} sector in the economy. Funded by high revenues from oil and pressed by the need for economic development {{at a time when}} a vigorous indigenous private sector was virtually nonexistent, the government found itself, willingly or unwillingly, {{at the center of the}} development process, as a planner and implementer. The government's interest in achieving a diversified economy, which does not depend solely on the oil sector, has led to the introduction of many types of incentives such as, procurement, subsidies, concessionary loans, and awarding of infrastructure contracts. The aim of these incentives has been to stimulate and improve private sector investment. It can be said that the private sector in Saudi Arabia has developed much more after the provision of the incentives, particularly in the agriculture sector. Nonetheless, no study has been made to evaluate these incentives and find out their role in the development of the private sector. Thus, this study aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the <b>incentives</b> <b>policy</b> in Saudi Arabia and to evaluate its impact on the development of the private sector, which is the target sector. The methodology adopted in this study has involved three aspects of research : a) Theoretical aspect: this involves reviewing the theoretical side of the relationship between the <b>incentives</b> <b>policy</b> and the desired economic objectives. b) Field research aspect: this involves designing a questionnaire and an interview directed to the private sector's establishments and businessmen, respectively. c) Regression aspect: a time-series regression analysis concerning the impact of government expenditures, in general, and the incentives, in particular, on the private sector investment and output, has been carried out...|$|E

Using a principal-agent model, North Carolina public school data, and the state's unique accountability system that rewards teachers for school-level academic growth, we show that we can distill effort from teacher absence data and capture its effect on student achievement in a structural framework. We find that: 1. Incentives lead teachers to try harder. The bonus program reduced the number of sick days taken by about 0. 6 days for an average teacher. 2. When teachers try harder, students do better. Increased effort of teachers translates into improved student performance.
