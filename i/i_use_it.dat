500|$|During his career, Stewart was {{regarded}} as one of the hardest bodycheckers in the National Hockey League. [...] He also carried the heaviest stick in the league, explaining that [...] "I don't use it for scoring. <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> for breaking arms". [...] Stewart was known for his large grin when hitting opponents; teammate Ted Lindsay noted [...] "when he had that smile, it was time for the opposition to look out". [...] He led the league with 73 penalty minutes in 1945–46, and in the late 1940s, his rivalry with Milt Schmidt of the Boston Bruins was so intense that their physical interactions occasionally overshadowed the games themselves.|$|E
500|$|Simone's bearing {{and stage}} {{presence}} earned her the title [...] "High Priestess of Soul". She was a piano player, singer and performer, [...] "separately, and simultaneously." [...] As a composer and arranger, Simone moved from gospel to blues, jazz, and folk, and to numbers with European classical styling. Besides using Bach-style counterpoint, she called upon the particular virtuosity of the 19th-century Romantic piano repertoire—Chopin, Liszt, Rachmaninoff, and others. Onstage, she incorporated monologues and dialogues {{with the audience}} into the program, and often used silence as a musical element. She compared it to [...] "mass hypnosis. <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> all the time." [...] Throughout {{most of her life}} and recording career she was accompanied by percussionist Leopoldo Fleming and guitarist and musical director Al Schackman.|$|E
5000|$|Rapper T-Pain, {{who also}} uses that audio processor, criticized Future's {{unconventional}} <b>use</b> of <b>it</b> in 2014. In response, Future stated {{in an interview}} that [...] "when <b>I</b> first <b>used</b> Auto-Tune, <b>I</b> never <b>used</b> <b>it</b> to sing. <b>I</b> wasn’t <b>using</b> <b>it</b> the way T-Pain was. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> to rap because it makes my voice sound grittier. Now everybody wants to rap in Auto-Tune. Future’s not everybody." [...] Future's music has been characterized as trap music.|$|R
5000|$|Future uses Auto-Tune in his songs. Rapper T-Pain, {{who also}} uses that audio processor, criticized Future, {{stating that the}} rapper doesn't know how to <b>use</b> <b>it</b> correctly. After that {{announcement}} Future stated in an interview; [...] "When <b>I</b> first <b>used</b> Auto-Tune, <b>I</b> never <b>used</b> <b>it</b> to sing. <b>I</b> wasn’t <b>using</b> <b>it</b> the way T-Pain was. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> to rap because it makes my voice sound grittier.

My only official recommendations are US Army issued mustache trimmers, Morton's Salt, and the C.R. Lawrence fine two inch style oscillating knife blade." [...] That line was written by Schur, and the scene used in the episode was Nick Offerman's first take, with no mistakes made with the complicated dialogue. Immediately after [...] "The Fight" [...] first aired, a [...] "Producer's Cut" [...] version was made available on the official NBC.com website. It included an additional four minutes of material, that include a previously-unaired cold open in which Ron sternly demands to know which employee has broken the parks department's coffee machine; this prompts a fight as the staff make accusations against each other. Ron secretly reveals to the camera that he broke the machine himself, but questioned the other employees anyway to deliberately start the arguments.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{predicted}} in January 1966 {{that the various}} boycotts would force Smith to give in [...] "within {{a matter of weeks}} rather than months", but the British (and later UN) sanctions had little effect on Rhodesia, largely because South Africa and Portugal went on trading with it, providing it with oil and other key resources. Clandestine trade with other nations also continued, initially at a reduced level, and the diminished presence of foreign competitors helped domestic industries to slowly mature and expand. Even many OAU states, while bombarding Rhodesia with opprobrium, continued importing Rhodesian food and other products. Rhodesia thus avoided the economic cataclysm predicted by Wilson and gradually became more self-sufficient. [...] "Rhodesia can not only take it, but she can also make it," [...] Smith said on 29 April 1966, while opening the annual Central African Trade Fair in Bulawayo. [...] "When I say take it, <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> in two ways. Firstly, when it comes to sanctions we have proved we can take it. Secondly, when it comes to independence, we have also proved we can take it." ...|$|E

2500|$|An October 18, 2006, {{article in}} the Washington Post quotes a recent {{interview}} with Webb concerning the portrayal of ethnic stereotypes in Hollywood. Webb said, [...] "Towel-heads and rednecks -- of which I am one. If you write that word, please say that. I mean, I don't use that pejoratively, <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> defensively. Towel-heads and rednecks became the easy villains in so many movies out there".|$|E
2500|$|Regarding vocal processors, Harrell says [...] "it's {{the sound}} of today in pop music. [...] But <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> as an {{enhancement}} and not to create the sound. [...] My role is to capture the artist's personality. [...] To trick them out with Auto-Tune would defeat that purpose, but consumers are used to hearing things pitch perfect so I use pitch correction to ensure that I have a flawless performance." ...|$|E

[...] The quanzhi, a double-reed pipe, he describes as [...] "in its own category, unique, a character instrument, very sad, very touchiing—and intimate, like a human voice singing, so it pairs well with the voice, and it's not loud. <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> with the orchestra doing a low drone {{in the background and}} the voice soaring over it." ...|$|E

2500|$|James Taylor {{was born}} in Burrough on the Hill, a small village in Leicestershire. His father, Steve, was a National Hunt jockey until injury forced him to retire {{and he is now}} a race starter. Standing 5 feet 1 inches tall, Taylor is known for his {{diminutive}} height {{and is one of the}} shortest cricketers to have [...] played English county cricket., though he is one inch taller than Sachin Tendulkar.

2500|$|Obama and Clinton {{were in a}} {{statistical}} dead heat in Texas, according to a poll released February 25, 2008. During Obama's sweep of February's post-Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses, the March 4 primaries of Texas and Ohio were seen as a firewall for the Clinton campaign. In early polls for these states, Clinton held double digit leads in polls for those states, {{but by the end}} of February Obama had started to erode Clinton's lead in her key demographics, and her lead had been reduced to single digits in some polls. In response to Obama's increases, Clinton's campaign began to increase their attacks on him, including an accusation of plagiarism due to similarities in Obama's campaign speeches and campaign speeches of Obama's campaign's national co-chair and Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick, although Patrick specifically stated he told Obama to use it. During the February 21, CNN-Univision debate in Austin, Texas Obama responded to the accusation by saying, [...] "The notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who's one of my national co-chairs, who gave me the line and suggested that <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>it,</b> I think is silly." [...] Clinton received a round of boos from the crowd when she responded, [...] "Lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can believe in; it's change you can Xerox." ...|$|E
