5|$|From Liverpool's {{point of}} view, the {{situation}} was that Shankly had retired and the club had to move on. Shankly did not understand that by turning up for training at Melwood, he was effectively undermining Bob Paisley, who had succeeded him as manager, {{even to the point}} of actually taking over the training. Tommy Smith recalled that Shankly as manager never ran training and would only speak to Paisley, Fagan and Bennett about what needed to be done. But, as a visitor at Melwood he began to intervene and Paisley's initial pleasure on seeing him soon turned to polite embarrassment. Eventually, Paisley had to point out to Shankly that he didn't work there any more, that it was now Paisley's team and that he <b>had</b> <b>things</b> which he wanted to do with the team.|$|E
25|$|QOTW Off Topic {{was invented}} for those users of QOTW who found they <b>had</b> <b>things</b> in common and {{liked to talk}} to each other using the reply system. Over several weeks it became clear that more and more people were preferring to chat to each other through the replies instead of the /talk board which was already set up, so Off Topic was created.|$|E

There I learned to appreciate the music of my people … then the blues were born, because from that day on, I started thinking about putting my own experience down in that particular kind of music.|$|E

25|$|At 9:00 {{hours on}} 9 September, Barge met with Gandin and misled him {{by stating that}} he had {{received}} no orders from the German command. The two men liked each other and they <b>had</b> <b>things</b> in common as Gandin was pro-German and liked Goethe. Indeed, Gandin's pro-German attitude was the reason he had been sent by General Ambrosio to command the Acqui Division: fearing he might side with the Germans against the evolving plot to depose Mussolini, Ambrosio wanted Gandin out of Italy. Both men ended their meeting on good terms, agreeing to wait for orders and also that the situation should be resolved peacefully.|$|E
500|$|Prior to acting, LaBeouf practiced comedy {{around his}} {{neighborhood}} as an [...] "escape" [...] from a hostile environment. At age 10, he began performing stand-up at comedy clubs, describing his appeal as having [...] "disgustingly dirty" [...] material and a [...] "50-year-old mouth on the 10-year-old kid." [...] He subsequently found an agent through the Yellow Pages {{and was taken}} on after pretending to be his own manager. LaBeouf {{has said that he}} initially became an actor because his family was broke, not because he wanted to pursue an acting career, having originally gotten the idea from a child actor he met who <b>had</b> <b>things</b> he wanted.|$|E
500|$|Gems {{eventually}} {{returned to}} the project, writing a total of 12 drafts of the script. Although he is credited with both the screen story and screenplay of Mars Attacks!, Gems dedicates his novelization of the movie to Burton, who [...] "co-wrote the screenplay and didn't ask for a credit". Warner Bros. was dubious of the Martian dialogue and wanted Burton to add closed captioning subtitles, but he resisted. Working with Burton, Gems pared the film's 60 leading characters down to 23, and the worldwide destruction planned for the film was isolated to three major cities. Scenes featuring Martians attacking China, the Philippines, Japan, Europe, Africa, India, and Russia were deleted from the screenplay. [...] "Bear in mind this was way before Independence Day (1996) was written," [...] Gems commented. [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>things</b> like Manhattan being destroyed building by building, the White House went {{and so did the}} Empire State Building. Warner Bros. figured all this would be too expensive, so we cut most of that out to reduce the cost." [...] Howard Stern claimed that the film's climax, where an attack by Martians was thwarted by playing Slim Whitman songs to them, was originally created by him when he worked at WNBC in 1982, in a sketch named [...] "Slim Whitman vs. The Midget Aliens From Mars." [...] As Burton listened to the sketch while being interviewed by Stern, he dismissed it as mere coincidence.|$|E

2500|$|Cain {{himself was}} {{very pleased with the}} way his book turned out on the screen. After seeing the picture half a dozen times he was quoted as saying, [...] "...It's the only picture I ever saw made from my books that <b>had</b> <b>things</b> in it I wish I had thought of. Wilder's ending was much better than my ending, and his device for letting the guy tell the story by taking out the office dictating machine – I would have done it if I had thought of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clara Schumann proved {{especially}} vehement. [...] After {{she heard}} him play the Mendelssohn C minor Trio in 1857, she wrote that [...] "he so rattled it off that I {{did not know how}} to control myself ... and often he so annihilated fiddle and cello that I ... could hear nothing of them." [...] Nor <b>had</b> <b>things</b> improved in Clara's view a few years later, when Rubinstein gave a concert in Breslau. [...] She noted in her diary, [...] "I was furious, for he no longer plays. [...] Either there is a perfectly wild noise or else a whisper with the soft pedal down. [...] And a would-be cultured audience puts up with a performance like that! ...|$|E

He found himself only earning enough to spend 35 cents a day on food (US$ in [...] dollars). However, the privacy he had above the Birdland Club allowed him to focus on writing without distractions; as he explained, [...] "Something new began to happen. I wasn't under the gun, and {{suddenly}} interesting songs began to happen, songs that <b>had</b> <b>things</b> none of the others did." [...] Among them were [...] "Cherry, Cherry" [...] and [...] "Solitary Man". [...] "Solitary Man" [...] was the first record that Diamond recorded in his own name that made the charts. It remains one of his personal all-time favorites, as it was autobiographical about his early years as a songwriter, even though he failed to realize it at the time: ...|$|E

2500|$|These {{states were}} based on either clans or tribes (e.g., the Horder of Hordaland in western Norway). By the 9th century, each of these small states <b>had</b> <b>things</b> (local or {{regional}} assemblies), for negotiating and settling disputes. The thing meeting places, each eventually with a hörgr (open-air sanctuary) or a heathen hof (temple; literally [...] "hill"), were usually situated on the oldest and best farms, which belonged to the chieftains and wealthiest farmers. The regional things united to form even larger units: assemblies of deputy yeomen from several regions. In this way, the lagting (assemblies for negotiations and lawmaking) developed. The Gulating had its meeting place by Sognefjord {{and may have been}} the centre of an aristocratic confederation along the western fjords and islands called the Gulatingslag. The Frostating was the assembly for the leaders in the Trondheimsfjord area; the Earls of Lade, near Trondheim, seem to have enlarged the Frostatingslag by adding the coastland from Romsdalsfjord to Lofoten.|$|E
