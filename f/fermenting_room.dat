40|$|Yeasting {{failures}} in beer production represent a se-rious problem {{that makes the}} fermentation longer and sometimes even stopped. They can impair beer quality due to changed sensorial properties of beers. The pro-longed yeasting time needed for reaching the required attenuation impairs {{the use of the}} <b>fermenting</b> <b>room</b> and if there is not enough space in it, the brewery has to fill barrels with beer, which is considerably green, which eventually can results in the quantity of insufficiently attenuated beer. Yeasting depends on a number of parameters, which affect the irregular course of fermentation. It might be induced by an immediate change of an important regu-lation element or by a combination of several factors. It can however also result from a slowly working facto...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a research {{carried out to}} develop a humidity control system for tea rolling and <b>fermenting</b> <b>room</b> of a tea factory. During the rolling process, cell breakage causes the mixing of enzymes with other chemical compounds, and fermentation starts and continues throughout the rolling and roll breaking processes. Further fermentation is allowed to continue on fermenting racks for such time as desirable. Rolling room operation should be geared for ventilating and humidifying to control those fermentation reactions at desired levels. Moisture is an essential requirement for enzyme activity and lack of humidity leads to surface drying of dhools and loosing the liquor properties of tea. During all rolling room processes, a humid atmosphere should surround dhools and hygrometric difference between 2 - 30 F is satisfactory. Humidification also helps in reducing the room temperature up {{to the level of}} ambient wet bulb. Since British introduced tea to Sri Lanka, almost all the factories still use wet and dry bulb hygrometers to observe the level of humidity during rolling and fermenting processes and use manually switchable humidifiers. Tea industry is still very reluctant to give-up wet and dry bulb difference method and move to work with relative humidity. Even Tea Research Institute in Sri Lanka is still using wet and dry bulb difference method. This research automates same art with digital wet and dry bulb sensors and reads level of relative humidity using a digital humidity sensor as an addition. While providing traditional dry-wet (D-W) control mode, the controller also provides humidity control mode for the customers to choose. Displaying relative humidity level at traditional dry-wet mode addresses the knowledge gap of tea makers to move to the direct humidity control mode from traditional wet and dry bulb difference method. The developed humidity control system addresses the lapses of previous products and performs satisfactorily compared to widely used low resolution alcohol wet and dry bulb hygrometers and automatically switches ON or OFF relevant humidifiers to maintain the desired humidity level...|$|E

40|$|Fermentation of tea-leaf was {{compared}} with different leaf ages, grades of leaf withering, temperatures and aerations. Fermentation {{was known to}} be very important for the final quality of tea. Careful estimation of redox potential proved suitable for study of fermentation in a single leaf. Potentiometric titration under aerated water (so not as normally in factories) showed that 'Buds' ('Pecco': best quality leaves) contained more ascorbid acid (AA) and fermented more rapidly than older leaves. More withered leaves fermented more actively and completely. Optimum temperature for fermentation was found to be about 26 °C. Aeration to a certain point encouraged fermentation strongly. Thorough grinding promoted fermentation most. AA had to be oxidized to allow reddish brown discoloration of fermenting tea-leaves. 'Buds' oxidized AA much quicker than older leaves. It was assumed that 'potential quality' of a fresh leaf was correlated with active fermentation. So in practice leaves had to be rolled often but briefly, while the rolling and <b>fermenting</b> <b>rooms</b> should be thoroughly aerated, although the leaves {{should not be allowed to}} dry. Ascorbic dehydrogenase, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase were involved in the oxidation of AA. Traces of CU 2 + (occurring in the prosthetic groups of ascorbic dehydrogenase and polyphenol oxidase) accelerated oxidation of AA in leaf extracts. Fe 3 + less so. By rectilinear adjustment fermentation activity could be calculated. It was higher for 'Buds' than for older leaves. /HTML>...|$|R

40|$|Background: Fermentation is an age old {{technique}} of preserving food in many communities. A {{wide range of}} fermented products are prepared by varying the types of raw materials, utensils, and fermentation times. Several fermented foods are consumed in Swaziland. A survey {{of the types of}} fermented foods, preparation methods, and utensils used was done in the Hhohho region of Swaziland. The current study aimed at documenting the preparation methods of emahewu, emasi, umcombotsi, and buganu at household levels. Methods: Detailed fermentation steps were documented for umcombotsi, emahewu, buganu, and emasi. Five constituencies, called tinkhundla, were randomly selected from the 14 found in the Hhohho region of Swaziland. At each inkhundla, households that were known to regularly prepare the fermented foods were identified with the assistance of local community leaders and were interviewed. A semistructured questionnaire was used for the face-to-face interviews. Results: With respect to preparation procedures and practices, all respondents indicated that they had prepared different fermented foods at one time or another. The most commonly prepared and readily available fermented foods were umcombotsi (alcoholic beverage), emahewu (nonalcoholic beverage), buganu (marula wine), and emasi (spontaneously fermented milk). Both men and women indicated that they prepared umcombotsi, and only women reported that they prepared emahewu, buganu, and emasi. Umcombotsi was mainly prepared for sale, while buganu, emahewu, and emasi were for sale as well as for household consumption. Umcombotsi was mostly prepared by mixing maize meal, unmilled sorghum malt (magayiwe), and brown sugar (3  kg) in water (20  L). The initial stage involved cooking the mixture to gelatinize the starch, followed by fermentation at ambient temperature (25 – 30 °C) for about 72 hours. The whole preparation process takes about 4 – 5 days. Emahewu was prepared by mixing maize meal (1  kg) with water (5  L) and cooking to make a soft porridge. The cooled porridge was left to <b>ferment</b> at <b>room</b> temperature. Some reported adding sugar or a peeled potato to aid the fermentation process. Emasi was prepared by letting raw milk to naturally <b>ferment</b> at <b>room</b> temperature (25 – 30 °C) in either metal or plastic containers (buckets) for 2 – 3 days. Buganu was prepared from marula fruit (amaganu) juice and pulp mixed with water (10  L) and sugar (2  kg). The mixture was allowed to ferment at ambient temperature for about 3 days, sieved, and then served. Conclusion: Umcombotsi, emahewu, buganu, and emasi were the fermented foods commonly prepared at a household level in the Hhohho region, Swaziland. The main ingredient used for preparing umcombotsi and emahewu was maize meal. Unmilled sorghum malt was also added during preparation of umcombotsi. However, typically no malt was added during the preparation of emahewu. Buganu and emasi also {{play an important role in}} the diet and socioeconomic activities of the population in Swaziland...|$|R

Samples were withdrawn at intervals of 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h, dewatered, sifted and toasted into gari and packaged in cellophane bags. The process was again carried out at 35 and 40 o C. The product gari was subjected to functional analysis (swelling index, pH, titrable acidity, water absorption capacity and residual cyanide) and sensory evaluation (appearance, taste and general acceptability) for the uncooked gari. The results obtained show that the buffer treated samples had high pH than the control sample. The highest mean pH was recorded for the BS = 8. 0, (7. 19), followed by BS = 7. 0 (6. 55) and BS = 6. 0 (5. 97), while the control had the lowest 4. 5. The highest Swelling Index (SI) (17. 45 ml/ml) was obtained for BS = 5. 0 and closely followed by BS = 6. 0 (17. 14 ml/ml) while BS = 8. 0 recorded the least 16. 91 ml/ml.

Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) seeds were soaked for 12 h at room temperature (32 ± 2 °C) and sprouted for 48 h at the same temperature. The sprouted seeds were washed, dried and milled into flour. The flour was divided into two portions, the first was allowed to <b>ferment</b> naturally at <b>room</b> temperature for 48 h and used to produce germinated and fermented fura (GFF). The second portion was used for the production of Germinated Fura (GF). The cleaned, ungerminated grains were milled and the flour also divided into two portions. The first portion was wetted, fermented and used to produce Fermented Fura (FF). The second portion was used to produce Traditional Fura (TF). Standard assay procedures were used to evaluate the fura samples for nutrient composition and phytic acid levels. Germination and fermentation increased the protein, ash, crude fibre, phosphorus, calcium and iron levels of the fura samples. The phytic acid levels were significantly reduced (p< 0. 05) compared with the control (220 mg/ 100 for GFF, 230 mg 100 gG for GF, 266 mg 100 gG for FF and 416 mg 100 gG for the control, TF. The 1 1 1 sensory panelists rated the fura sample from germinated grains highly for all the sensory parameters investigated.

The fillets via salting in 15 % NaCl by a ratio of 1 : 2 (w/w) were immersed in high-salt kasu-paste (Shoashing-vinasse: water: salt: sugar: rice-wine＝ 100 : 50 : 30 : 30 : 30 w/w, HSKP) with a ratio of 1 : 2 (w/w) and <b>fermented</b> at <b>room</b> temperature (high temperature high salt kasu-zuke; HTHSK). Changes in components of fish and kasu-paste were determined. The contribution of vinasse protease during kasu-zuke was also investigated. The results obtained were as follows: 1. Inter components transfer between tilapia fillet and vinasse occurred during kasu-zuke. No difference in components of the fillets from after 6 days HTHSK was observed. However off-flavor occurred on LTLSK fillet. Six days was a optimal time for kasu-zuke by Shoashing- vinasse. 2. NaCl content of HTHSK and LTLSK samples were 10 % and 2. 2 %, total bacterial counts(TBC) were 10000 and 100000 CFU/g for HTHSK and LTLSK, respectively. Alcohol, reducing sugar, and free amino acid were 3. 5 %, 62 mg/ 100 g, 15. 07 umol/g for HTHSK, and 3. 0 %, 92 mg/ 100 g, 3. 44 umol/g for LTLSK. Formic acid was the major organic acid (60 mg/ 100 g) in both HTHSK and LTLSK tilapia meat. VBN contents were 110 mg/ 100 g for HTHSK and 18 mg/ 100 g for LTLSK. Only putrescine, histamine and tyramine were detected in biogenic amines and their contents were 0. 57, 22. 21, 0. 22 mg/ 100 g for HTHSK and 0. 49, 6. 4, 2. 11 mg/ 100 g for LTLSK, respectively. From the results, LTLSK was better than HTHSK to obtain high quality products. 3. The optimum conditions of Shoashing-vinasse protease were pH 3. 0, 20 ℃, 2 % alcohol and less than 2 %NaCl. The heat inactivation rate constant (Kd) was 9. 4 × 100000 /sec, while the △E, △H, △S and △G were 17. 10 kcal/mole, 16. 52 kcal/mole, 2. 3 e. u and 15. 85 kcal/mole for 20 ℃, respectively. The enzyme was sensitive to salt and heat, contribution of vinasse to kasu- zuke products resulted from the components of vinasse itself and enzymes contained in fish meat rather than protease action. 4. The tilapia fillets obtained from LTLSK and HTHSK could be packaged and labeled with cooking method as a low temperature distribution products. The products via preparation and sterilization could also be distributed at normal temperature as directly edible products. 中文摘要 本研究以省產吳郭魚及紹興酒粕為材料，將魚片與低鹽酒粕 混合糊(米酒：水：鹽：糖：酒粕 = 30 ： 50 ： 4. 5 ： 30 ： 100 w/w) 以 1 ： 2 (w/w) 的比例於 4 ℃ 下進行低溫低鹽粕漬(low temperature low salt kasu-zuke；LTLSK) ；或將鹽漬魚片(魚肉： 15 % 鹽水 = 1 ： 2 w/w) 與高鹽酒粕混合糊(米酒：水：鹽：糖：酒粕 = 30 ： 50 ： 30 ： 30 ： 100 w/ w) 以 1 ： 2 (w/w) 的比例於室溫(23 - 28 ℃) 下進行高溫高鹽粕漬(high temperature high salt kasu-zuke；HTHSK) 。檢測粕漬過程中魚肉及粕 糊之成分，此外亦探討酵素對製品之貢獻。所得結論如下： 1. 粕漬期間 ，魚片與粕糊成分有互相移動現象，HTHSK 粕漬 6 日後，魚片所 含 成分差異不大；LTLSK 粕漬時間過長時魚片會有不良氣味產生，兩者之粕 漬時間均以 6 日為宜。 2. 粕漬 6 日後魚片之含鹽量 HTHSK 為 10 %， LTLSK 為 2. 2 %；總菌數分別 為 10000 、 100000 CFU/g；酒精、還原糖 及游離胺基酸含量HTHSK 分別為 3. 5 %、 62 mg/ 100 g 及 15. 07 umol/g ；LTLSK 則分別為 3. 0 %、 92 mg/ 100 g 及 3. 4 umol/g ；有機酸含量方 面以甲酸含量最高，兩者皆約 60 mg/ 100 g；VBN 含 量則依序為 110 、 18 mg/ 100 g；生物胺含量方面putrescine、histamine及 tyramine可偵測，HTHSK含量依次約為 0. 57 、 22. 2 及 0. 22 mg/ 100 g， LTLSK 依次為 0. 49 、 6. 40 及 2. 11 mg/ 100 g。綜合而言，LTLSK 法於 魚肉品質之保 持上較為有利。 3. 酒粕酵素之最適作用條件為 pH 3. 0 、 20 ℃、 2 % 酒精及食鹽含量低於 2 %。 其熱失活速率為 9. 4 × 100000 /sec(20 ℃) ， 20 ℃ 下之 △E、△H、 △S及 △G 分 別為 17. 10 kcal/mole、 16. 52 kcal/mole、 2. 3 e. u 及 15. 85 kcal/mole。此 酵素對鹽 及熱敏感，無論 LTLSK 與 HTHSK 法均易失活，故粕漬過程 中蛋白質分解酵 素所提供之作用無多，粕漬之效果主要應來自粕本身 之成分及魚肉自身所含酵 素之作用。 4.
