Further analysis on Klein-Gordon (<b>KG)</b> <b>equation</b> reveals {{that there is a}} discrete symmetry hiding in relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) that P T= C. Here P T means the (newly defined) combined space-time inversion (with x→ - x, t→-t), while C the transformation of WF ψ between particle and its antiparticle whose definition is just residing in the above symmetry. After combining with Feshbach-Villars (FV) dissociation of <b>KG</b> <b>equation</b> (ψ=ϕ+χ) 2, this discrete symmetry can be rigorously reformulated by the invariance of coupling equation of ϕ and χ under either the combined space-time inversion P T or the mass inversion (m→ -m), which makes the <b>KG</b> <b>equation</b> a self-consistent theory. Dirac equation is also discussed accordingly. Various applications of this discrete symmetry are discussed, including the prediction of antigravity between matter and antimatter as well as the reason why we believe neutrinos are likely the tachyons.

40|$|A {{good way}} to really {{understand}} something {{is to try to}} build it yourself from scratch. This paper takes this approach to understanding the physical universe. We seek to build an autonomous model that produces known physics in a completely self-contained manner, as a way of understanding how nature works, automatically and without any human or other form of intervention, to produce the known universe. This approach leads naturally to a continuous-valued cellular automaton model, with the standard wave equation as one of the simplest possible forms of interaction that does anything interesting. Interesting indeed: Maxwell’s equations (in potential form) for the electromagnetic force obey a basic wave equation (actually four of them). Furthermore, a small modification of the wave equation produces the Klein-Gordon (<b>KG)</b> <b>equation,</b> which provides a good description of the propagation of a particle as a wave packet of charge, which is strictly conserved by this equation. Somewhat amazingly, this simple <b>KG</b> <b>equation</b> captures most of the major features of our physical universe, including special relativity and quantum → classical Newtonian mechanics.
