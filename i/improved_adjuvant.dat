40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{acceptance}} of liver transplantation {{in the management}} of hepatic malignancy declined after early poor outcomes. Despite recent developments, including stricter selection criteria and <b>improved</b> <b>adjuvant</b> therapies, the role of liver transplantation {{in the management of}} cancer remains controversial. This review explores the evidence for the current role of liver transplantation in the management of hepatic malignancy in the context of recent advances in surgical resection and non-surgical treatments. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the Cochrane Library and Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE, using terms for hepatic malignancy and interventions that included liver transplantation, percutaneous interventions, chemotherapy and surgical resection. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, improved selection has led to outcomes equivalent to those from surgical resection and comparable to those in patients transplanted for non-malignant indications. Recent studies suggest that selection criteria may be refined further. Surgical resection or percutaneous therapies may reduce the risk of progression while waiting for a transplant. Recent improvements have occurred in neoadjuvant therapies for cholangiocarcinoma. Nevertheless, a number of questions regarding the role of liver transplantation for hepatic malignancy remain...|$|E

Patient characteristics (age, gender) and tumour characteristics primary site, presence of lymph node involvement, catecholamine excretion, histology) were reviewed in an attempt to determine prognostic features. While age under 1 year at diagnosis was, as expected, favourable in this series, the most important prognostic variable was the presence or absence of regional lymph node involvement. No patient with uninvolved nodes died of neuroblastoma and the difference in the 3 -year survival rate between these patients and those with positive nodes was statistically significant. Although this study of patients treated between 1970 and 1977 provided no clear evidence that either postoperative radiotherapy or contemporary chemotherapy was of benefit, our findings suggest that subclassification of stage II patients into 'node-positive' and 'node-negative' groups will help to define those who might benefit from <b>improved</b> <b>adjuvant</b> postsurgical treatment...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundRecurrence of {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT) is rarely curable. However, {{in view of}} the advent of new treatments, it is critical that patients at high risk for recurrence are identified. MethodsPatients undergoing LT for HCC at a single centre between 2002 and 2010 were reviewed and data on clinical parameters and explant pathology were analysed to determine factors associated with HCC recurrence. All necrotic and viable tumour nodules were included in explant staging. All patients underwent LT according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) tumour exception policies. ResultsLiver transplantation was performed in 122 patients with HCC during this period. Rates of recurrence-free survival in the entire cohort at 1 year and 3 years were 95 % and 89 %, respectively. Thirteen patients developed HCC recurrence at a median of 14 months post-LT. In univariate analysis the factors associated with HCC recurrence were bilobar tumours, vascular invasion, and stage exceeding either Milan or University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Criteria. Multivariate analysis showed pathology outside UCSF Criteria was the major predictor of recurrence; when pathology outside UCSF Criteria was found in combination with vascular invasion, the predicted 3 -year recurrence-free survival was only 26 %.

There is a clear need for <b>improved</b> <b>adjuvant</b> treatment of this malignancy. We have observed the presence of osteoclasts in the microenvironment of chondrosarcoma in human pathological specimens. We utilized the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma (SRC) model {{to test the hypothesis}} that osteoclasts affect chondrosarcoma pathogenesis. We implanted SRC tumors in tibia of Sprague-Dawley rats and analyzed bone histologically and radiographically for bone destruction and tumor growth. At three weeks, tumors invaded local bone causing cortical disruption and trabecular resorption. Bone destruction was accompanied by increased osteoclast number and resorbed bone surface. Treatment of rats with the zoledronic acid prevented cortical destruction, inhibited trabecular resorption, and resulted in decreased tumor volume in bone. To confirm that inhibition of osteoclasts per se, and not off-target effects of drug, was responsible for the prevention of tumor growth and bone destruction, we implanted SRC into osteopetrotic rat tibia. SRC-induced bone destruction and tumor growth were impaired in osteopetrotic bone compared with control bone.

40|$|Background Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) {{followed}} by radiotherapy (RT) is an established treatment {{for women with}} T 1 - 2 N 0 breast cancers. Since subgroups of patients have low ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR) rates, {{it is important to}} study whether RT is necessary for all patients. Patients and methods A total of 1187 women with primary T 1 - 2 N 0 M 0 breast cancer were randomised, after standardised sector resection, to postoperative whole breast RT or no local treatment. Adjuvant systemic therapy was offered to patients with stage II cancers. Patients were followed with clinical examinations and annual mammography for 10 years and thereafter referred to the Swedish mammography screening program. Results After 15 years of follow-up, a higher cumulative incidence of IBTR was observed in control patients, 23. 9 %, versus irradiated patients, 11. 5 %, P < 0. 001. Recurrence-free survival was inferior, 51. 7 % versus 60. 4 %, P = 0. 0013. The main effect of RT was seen during the first 5 years. However, overall survival was not significantly lower 68. 4 % versus 71. 1 %, P = 0. 68, nor was breast cancer–specific mortality significantly higher. Conclusions RT after BCS significantly reduced the incidence of IBTR at 15 years of follow-up. We were unable to identify subgroups which could be spared RT.

Previous single-center reports on outcome mostly encompass small series. In this report a relative large series of 105 cases is analyzed, all treated at the VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands over a 30 -year period in which treatment strategies remained unchanged. Methods All cases of ACC {{of the head and}} neck between 1979 and 2009 at our institution were analyzed through a medical chart review. Recurrence patterns and possible prognostic factors (T-stage, N-status, age, gender, type of salivary gland involved, histological grade, surgical margins, perineural invasion (PNI) and postoperative radiotherapy (RT)) were analyzed. Results One-hundred and five cases of ACC {{of the head and neck}} were identified. Five-, ten- and twenty-year survival rates for overall survival were 68 %, 52 % and 28 %, respectively. T-stage, N-status, surgical margins, histological subtype and age were highly significant predictors for survival. PNI was not a negative prognosticator. Conclusions T-stage, N-status, surgical margins, histological grade and age are the main predictors of survival-outcome in ACC of the head and neck. Distant metastasis frequently develop, mainly in the first 5 years post treatment. Local recurrences often develop even later on, warranting long term follow up of patients treated for ACC.

40|$|Progesterone {{receptor}} {{status is}} a marker for hormone responsiveness and disease prognosis in breast cancer. Progesterone receptor negative tumours {{have generally been}} shown to have a poorer prognosis than progesterone receptor positive tumours. The observed loss of progesterone receptor could be through a range of mechanisms, including the generation of alternatively spliced progesterone receptor variants that are not detectable by current screening methods. Many progesterone receptor mRNA variants have been described with deletions of various whole, multiple or partial exons that encode differing protein functional domains. These variants may alter the progestin responsiveness of a tissue and contribute to the abnormal growth associated with breast cancer. Absence of specific functional domains from these spliced variants may also make them undetectable or indistinguishable from full length progesterone receptor by conventional antibodies. A comprehensive investigation into the expression profile and activity of progesterone receptor spliced variants in breast cancer is required to advance our understanding of tumour hormone receptor status.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, many {{articles}} in the world literature have spelt out {{the potential benefits of}} mammography screening for breast cancer (Day et al., 1986; Miller et al., 1990). All anticipated that if the right management decisions were taken, and women at risk attended for screening, there would be major reductions in breast cancer mortality, at least among women age 50 - 69. However, doubt has been expressed as to whether the randomised trials that showed a benefit from breast screening were valid (Gotzsche et al., 2000; Olsen and Gotzsche, 2001). Also, the fact that there has been no increase in the magnitude of effect of screening in the trials which have shown a benefit since the HIP trial of the 1960 s, suggests that improvements in mammography have not resulted in improvement in the efficacy of screening. Further, there has been an unprecedented fall in mortality from breast cancer in the United States, as well as in Canada and the United Kingdom. Yet, surprisingly, {{there has not been a}} similar dramatic fall in Sweden, nor in the Netherlands or Finland, countries that also introduced organised screening programmes for breast cancer.

40|$|Fusion {{antibodies}} are recombinant constructs comprising an antigen-binding {{antibody fragment}} and an effector molecule {{such as an}} enzyme. Such constructs have mainly been designed for use in is antineoplastic therapy. In this context, antibody-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy (ADEPT) is a two-step approach utilizing fusion-antibodies for the tumor-specific activation of inert prodrugs. In the first step, the antibody construct binds to a tumor-specific antigen. Subsequently, the enzyme component of the construct converts a systemically applied, relatively non-toxic prodrug into a cytotoxic metabolite, thus focusing its activity to the tumor tissue. Given the hitherto unsatisfactory outcome of chemotherapy for colorectal carcinoma, ADEPT may provide a means of <b>improved</b> <b>adjuvant</b> or palliative therapy for this cancer. The A 33 antigen is expressed on the cell surface in 95 % of colon carcinomas and has been utilized to detect both primary and metastatic tumor sites with high sensitivity. Thus, it is a potential target antigen for ADEPT. To realize the experimental or clinical use of fusion antibodies for ADEPT, expression systems are required which can produce in large scale complex proteins in soluble and functional form. The results presented here establish such an expression system {{for the production of}} fusion antibodies in the yeast Pichia pastoris, using an A 33 rbGFP fusion protein as a pilot subject. This fusion protein consisted of a single chain variable region fragment (scFv) directed against the A 33 antigen, termed A 33 rb, and green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP has been chosen for this pilot project because it allows for one-step fluorescence analysis of fusion protein binding. Specific binding could be demonstrated, comparing various colon carcinoma cell lines quantitatively. In addition, attempts were made to express the fusion construct A 33 rbCD, which contains the bacterial enzyme cytosine deaminase (CD) instead of GFP. A potential effector enzyme for ADEPT, CD catalyses the conversion of 5 -fluorocytosine, which is non-toxic in humans, into the cytotoxic drug 5 -fluorouracil. The results of extensive experiments, however, suggested that this fusion construct in the selected form could not be expressed in the yeast system. Therefore we designed and cloned an analogous construct, replacing the bacterial CD enzyme with the isoenzyme from the yeast Sacharomyces cerevisiae (CDy). This new construct is expected to be produced more readily in the yeast expression system...|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands, {{breast cancer}} is the most {{frequent}} (30 %) of all cancers in women. In 2008, around 13, 000 women were newly diagnosed with the disease. Worldwide, breast cancer accounted for almost 1. 4 million new cancer patients in 20082. Incidence rates of breast cancer have been increasing in the Netherlands since 1960. This increase {{can be explained by}} several factors: the increased detection of (early) breast cancer due to the introduction and increased use of mammography and cytology since the 1980 s, the implementation of the mass breast cancer screening program between 1991 and 1996, and a change in adverse way of the risk factors for breast cancer over the years. Many known risk factors are related to endogenous hormones: young age at menarche, higher age at menopause, high age at first childbirth, lower parity, shorter lactation and obesity. Changes in adverse way of these reproductive patterns and other lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, have almost certainly {{played an important role in}} the increase of breast cancer incidence. In 2008, 3, 300 patients died of breast cancer in the Netherlands, making it, together with lung cancer, the most important cause of cancer death among women. However, breast cancer survival has improved for several decades: in the 1970 s 5 -year relative survival was less than 50 %, while for patients diagnosed in 2000 - 2002 this was 80 %. Factors related to the increased survival are, among other things, early detection through breast cancer awareness and screening, resulting in a more favourable stage distribution, and <b>improved</b> (<b>adjuvant)</b> treatment. With the incidence rates of breast cancer increasing and survival rates improving, the number of prevalent breast cancer patients will continue to rise. In 2005 it was estimated that 119, 000 patients in the Netherlands were ever diagnosed with breast cancer 6. Breast cancer prevalence rises with approximately 5 % annually, and in 2015 the number of (ex-) breast cancer patients might increase to about 194, 000. This number is expected to continue to rise also due to demographic developments (age distribution skewed toward old age). A large proportion of these women will still require some form of health care, either for diagnosis and treatment, surveillance during follow-up, or because of recurrences, metastases or new primary malignancies.

40|$|The {{progress}} toward subunit vaccines {{has been limited}} by their poor immunogenicity and limited stability. To enhance the immune response, subunit vaccines universally require <b>improved</b> <b>adjuvants</b> and delivery vehicles. In the present paper, we propose the use of cross-linked protein crystals (CLPCs) as antigens. We compare the immunogenicity of CLPCs of human serum albumin with that of soluble protein and conclude that there are marked differences in the immune response to the different forms of human serum albumin. Relative to the soluble protein, crystalline forms induce and sustain over almost a 6 -month study a 6 - to 10 -fold increase in antibody titer for highly cross-linked crystals and an approximately 30 -fold increase for lightly cross-linked crystals. We hypothesize that the depot effect, the particulate structure of CLPCs, and highly repetitive nature of protein crystals may play roles in the enhanced production of circulating antibodies. Several features of CLPCs, such as their remarkable stability, purity, biodegradability, and ease of manufacturing, make them highly attractive for vaccine formulations.

30|$|The {{safety and}} {{efficacy}} of Seprafilm use has been demonstrated in abdominopelvic surgery. Retrospective analysis from {{the result of a}} randomized controlled trial suggests that wrapping Seprafilm around a newly created anastomosis may be associated with an increase in anastomotic leak related adverse events (fistula, leak, abscess, peritonitis, and sepsis). Based upon this data, Seprafilm labeling has been updated to warn against wrapping Seprafilm directly around a newly created anastomotic suture or staple line. Additional studies have been undertaken in abdominopelvic procedures to explore the use of Seprafilm in the presence of overt infections, malignancy, in pediatric patents, in early ileostomy closure, laparoscopic surgery, and cesarean sections. While the results of these studies are interesting, appropriately designed randomized controlled clinical trials still need to be conducted. Additionally, the results of one cost-effectiveness study are encouraging but more investigation is warranted. Also, other future studies are needed to further delineate the molecular biologic processes leading to normal peritoneal healing as opposed to adhesion development, which would allow targeted interventions to <b>improve</b> <b>adjuvant</b> efficacy. Such approaches could utilize anti-adhesion products to physically separate otherwise opposing tissue surfaces while also serving as a carrier for the delivery of drugs and/or biologics to further improve the efficacy of anti-adhesion adjuvants.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Estrogen {{receptor}} alpha (ERalpha) plays a {{major role}} in breast cancer development. It acts as ligand-inducible transcription factor which determines growth, survival and differentiation of breast cancer cells. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential interference between radiotherapy and estrogen receptor responsiveness. Materials and methods. The effect of ionizing radiation was assessed on the estrogen receptor alpha status, growth (proliferation and apoptosis) and sensitivity of MCF- 7 breast cancer cells to estrogenic (17 beta-estradiol (E 2)), selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and anti-estrogenic compounds. Results. We have observed a ligand-independent decrease in ERalpha expression after radiation, resulting from a specific reduction in mRNA level and protein synthesis. This ERalpha disappearance occurred 72 h post-irradiation at 8 Gy and decreased the transcriptional activity in ERalpha of these cells. On the other hand, E 2 impedes the growth inhibitory effects (essentially on proliferation) of ionizing radiation in MCF- 7 cells, which potentially decreases radiosensitivity of these cells. This effect was totally blocked by SERM and anti-estrogenic treatments. Moreover, this growth effect of concurrent anti-estrogenic drugs and ionizing radiation appeared to be strongly synergistic. CONCLUSIONS: This study may increase general comprehension of ERalpha modulation by radiotherapy and <b>improve</b> <b>adjuvant</b> therapeutic approaches based on co-administration of radiation and endocrine therapy.

40|$|The {{development}} of new protein subunit vaccines has stimulated the search for <b>improved</b> <b>adjuvants</b> to replace traditional aluminum-containing products. We investigated the adjuvant effects of a synthetic Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) agonist on vaccine efficacy in an experimental model of toxic shock syndrome. The TLR 4 agonist E 6020 has a simplified structure consisting of a hexa-acylated acyclic backbone. The vaccine examined is a recombinantly attenuated form of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (STEBVax). Using cells stably transfected with TLRs, E 6020 transduced signals only through TLR 4, suggesting monospecificity, while Escherichia coli 055 :B 5 lipopolysaccharide activated both the TLR 2 / 6 heterodimer and TLR 4. Coadministration of E 6020 with STEBVax, by the intramuscular or intranasal route, induced significant levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in BALB/c mice. Further, increased IgG production resulted from the combination of E 6020 with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (AH). The antibody response to the vaccine coadministered with E 6020 was a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 response, {{as opposed to the}} Th 2 -biased response obtained with AH. Mice vaccinated with STEBVax coadministered with AH, TLR 4 agonists, or a combination of both adjuvants were protected from toxic shock. Our data demonstrate the effectiveness of the synthetic TLR 4 agonist E 6020 as an alternative adjuvant for protein subunit vaccines that may also be used in combination with traditional aluminum-containing adjuvants...|$|R
40|$|Recently, cyclin-E was {{reported}} to be the most prominent prognostic factor for breast cancer outcome described so far, even surpassing axillary nodal involvement. Earlier studies on the prognostic value of cyclin-E in breast cancer, however, yielded heterogeneous results. Therefore, we set out to confirm and extend these results by quantitative Taqman RT-PCR of cyclin-E levels in 277 resectable breast cancers. Cyclin-E levels were not associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) or overall survival (OS) in the total cohort of patients, or in the subset of patients without involved lymph nodes that were not treated with adjuvant systemic therapy. Besides several classical clinicopathological factors, the interaction between cyclin-E and adjuvant endocrine therapy (P= 0. 01, HR= 3. 04, 95 % CI: 1. 30 - 7. 09) was found to contribute significantly in multivariate analyses. Cyclin-E levels were associated with poor RFS specifically in patients treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy (n= 108, P= 0. 001, HR= 4. 01, 95 % CI: 1. 76 - 9. 12), independent of estrogen receptor status. In conclusion, cyclin-E is not a pure prognostic factor in breast cancer, but rather a predictor of failure of endocrine therapy. Differences in literature on the presumed prognostic value of cyclin-E may be due to differences in treatment. Assessment of cyclin-E levels can aid in <b>improving</b> <b>adjuvant</b> treatment selection...|$|R
40|$|Although both {{breast cancer}} and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) are common conditions, the {{simultaneous}} coexistence of these two diseases is rare. ITP is an autoimmune disease in which the presence of autoantibodies against platelets results in splenic sequestration and thrombocytopenia that {{may be associated with}} lymphoid neoplasms [1]. Except for an observational case series of 10 patients [2], only a few individual case reports of ITP coinciding with breast cancer have been reported [3 – 8]. We are reporting two cases with simultaneous confirmed ITP and breast cancer. The platelet counts in both women have <b>improved</b> during <b>adjuvant</b> breast cancer chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInfluenza A viruses of the H 3 N 8 subtype are a {{major cause}} of {{respiratory}} disease in horses. Subclinical infection with virus shedding can occur in vaccinated horses, particularly where there is a mismatch between the vaccine strains and the virus strains circulating in the field. Such infections contribute to the spread of the disease. Rapid diagnostic techniques are available for detection of virus antigen and can be used as an aid in control programmes. Improvements have been made to methods of standardising inactivated virus vaccines, and a direct relationship between vaccine potency measured by single radial diffusion and vaccine-induced antibody measured by single radial haemolysis has been demonstrated. <b>Improved</b> <b>adjuvants</b> and antigenic presentation systems extend the duration of immunity induced by inactivated virus vaccines, but high levels of antibody are required for protection against field infection. In addition to circulating antibody, infection with influenza virus stimulates mucosal and cellular immunity; unlike immunity to inactivated virus vaccines, infection-induced immunity is not dependent on the presence of circulating antibody to HA. Live attenuated or vectored equine influenza vaccines, which may better mimic the immunity generated by influenza infection than inactivated virus vaccines, are now available. Mathematical modelling based upon experimental and field data has been applied to examine issues relating to vaccine efficacy at the population level. A vaccine strain selection system has been implemented and a more global approach to the surveillance of equine influenza is being developed...|$|R
