5|$|Fay {{accelerated}} {{towards the}} Texas coast and made landfall early on September 7. The storm meandered throughout <b>inland</b> Texas, {{and as the}} system moved <b>inland,</b> forward speed decreased and Fay weakened to a tropical depression. The last advisory was issued on Fay on September 7, although the depression persisted for several days just <b>inland</b> of the Texas Coast.|$|E
5|$|After it {{merged with}} the system, the storm moved <b>inland</b> over Arkansas, Tennessee and the Ohio Valley. While moving <b>inland,</b> Matthew spun off another low {{pressure}} system that formed over North Carolina on October 13. The low moved off the Mid-Atlantic coast before hitting Massachusetts two days later, and later {{merged with the}} original low pressure system of Matthew.|$|E
5|$|Although {{extrapolated}} {{peak maximum}} sustained winds based on whatever reports are available exist for every storm in 1860, estimated minimum central barometric air pressure listings are only {{present for the}} three storms that made landfall in the United States. As the three landfalling storms moved <b>inland,</b> information on their meteorological dissipation was limited. As a result, the intensity of these storms after landfall and until dissipation {{is based on an}} <b>inland</b> decay model developed in 1995 to predict the deterioration of <b>inland</b> hurricanes.|$|E

5|$|Although {{extrapolated}} peak winds {{based on}} whatever reports are available exist for every storm in 1861, estimated minimum barometric air pressure listings are only {{present for the}} three storms that directly affected the United States. Two hurricanes during the year made landfall on the mainland United States, and as they progressed <b>inland,</b> information on their meteorological demise was limited.

5|$|During the summer, the American white ibis roams {{along the}} coast of tidal flats and {{mangrove}} swamps as the <b>inland</b> marshes are usually flooded. However, as the water level recedes in the fall, populations at the coast shift their foraging area <b>inland,</b> to <b>inland</b> marshes and swamplands. It has become more common in urban landscapes in Florida since the late 1990s, and is {{one of a number of}} wetland-dependent bird species which forages in man-made ponds on golf courses in the southwest of the state.|$|E
5|$|Haas' early third {{millennium}} dates {{suggest that the}} development of coastal and <b>inland</b> sites occurred in parallel. But, from 2500 to 2000 BC, during the period of greatest expansion, the population and development decisively shifted toward the <b>inland</b> sites. All development apparently occurred at large interior sites such as Caral, though they remained dependent on fish and shellfish from the coast. The peak in dates is in keeping with Shady's dates at Caral, which show habitation from 2627 BC to 2020 BC. That coastal and <b>inland</b> sites developed in tandem remains disputed, however (see next section).|$|E

5|$|The {{advance of}} the 18th RCT cleared away the last {{remnants}} of the force defending the E-1 draw. When engineers cut a road up {{the western side of}} this draw, it became the main route <b>inland</b> off the beaches. With the congestion on the beaches thus relieved, they were re-opened for the landing of vehicles by 14:00. Further congestion on this route, caused by continued resistance just <b>inland</b> at St. Laurent, was bypassed with a new route, and at 17:00, the surviving tanks of the 741st tank battalion were ordered <b>inland</b> via the E-1 draw.|$|E

50|$|During the 19th century, {{a serious}} clash between liberals and Miguelites, caused an exodus {{of people from}} the Algarvian <b>inlands</b> to the coastal cities. José Joaquim Sousa Reis, the Remexido, fought in the <b>inlands</b> and {{attacked}} the coastal cities, bringing the urban population into turmoil. The turmoil of the Algarve intensified in the years between 1834 and 1838, when the Algarve saw battles on a level it had never seen before. On November 26, 1836, Miguel I of Portugal named Remexido Governor of the Kingdom of the Algarve and Acting Commander in Chief of all the Royalist Troops, Regular and Irregular Armies, and the Operations in the South. Remexido, however, was shot in Faro on August 2, 1838.|$|R
5|$|They usually winter along coasts and on <b>inland</b> lakes, bays, inlets, and streams, {{with birds}} {{migrating}} {{to the nearest}} body of water that will not freeze over in the winter: western Canadian loons go to the Pacific, Great Lakes loons to the Gulf of Mexico region, eastern Canadian loons to the Atlantic, and some loons to large <b>inland</b> lakes and reservoirs. They appear {{in most of the}} <b>inland</b> waters of the United States. The South Carolina coast, the Gulf coast adjacent to the Florida panhandle, and the Atlantic seaboard from Massachusetts to Maine have some of the highest concentrations of common loons. Occasional vagrants are recorded <b>inland</b> in Mexico, in San Luis Potosí and Coahuila, as well as in Chiapas and Oaxaca in the south. They are accidental in northern Japan and the Commander Islands in northwestern Pacific, and Cuba in the West Indies.|$|E

5|$|After {{her return}} to Japan, Hōshō was {{transferred}} to the Third Fleet, unofficially assigned to the training fleet (later called the Mobile Force Training Force), and officially assigned in October. She conducted flight training in the <b>Inland</b> Sea for aircraft that flew in from shore bases, since no aircraft were based on board Hōshō. On 15 January 1943, the 50th Air Flotilla was created for carrier aircrew training and both Hōshō and Ryūhō were assigned to the new unit. The two ships provided carrier landing training and served as target ships for torpedo training. In January 1944, Hōshō was reassigned to the 12th Air Fleet, then to the Combined Fleet, but continued to perform the same mission of training fleet carrier pilots in the <b>Inland</b> Sea. In this role, Hōshō shuttled back and forth between Kure and the Western <b>Inland</b> Sea, spending equal amounts of time at each location.|$|E

50|$|The ten {{districts of}} Suriname {{are divided into}} 62 resorts (Dutch: ressorten).

The resorts in the Sipaliwini District are especially large, since the <b>inlands</b> of Suriname are sparsely inhabited.|$|R

From then until 15 June, she supported the army in its advance <b>inland.</b> By 15 June, the troops had advanced {{to the edge of}} Texass gun range; her last fire support mission was so far <b>inland</b> that to get the needed range, the starboard torpedo blister was flooded with water to provide a list of two degrees which gave the guns enough elevation to complete the fire mission. With combat operations beyond the range of her guns on 16 June, Texas left Normandy for England on 18 June.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{pelicans}} and double-crested cormorants {{are mainly}} found on cliffs {{along the coast}} and on seastacks, while sandpipers and gulls inhabit the seacoast and <b>inland</b> areas. <b>Inland,</b> freshwater-dependent birds such as the common merganser, osprey, red-shouldered hawk, great blue heron, and Steller's jay {{are a few of}} the bird species that have been documented. At least 400 bird species have been documented in the forestlands.|$|E

The monthly Ad Revenue Opportunity Report provides benchmarks of ROP (run-of-the-paper), classified and preprint advertising linage.|$|R
50|$|Notochelone is an extinct genus of sea turtle, which existed about 100 {{million years}} ago. The species was first {{described}} by Richard Lydekker in 1889. It {{was the most}} common marine reptile living in the <b>inlands</b> of the sea around Queensland, Australia. It was a small turtle, and was about {{the same size as the}} modern green turtle. Analytical studies have indicated that the creatures frequently ate benthic molluscs.|$|R

The Mataram rule upon Priangan <b>inlands</b> has exposed Sundanese people to Javanese cultures. When Panembahan Ratu died in 1649 he was succeeded by his grandson, Panembahan Girilaya.|$|R
