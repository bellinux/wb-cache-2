Beebe refuses to leave, {{but the house}} has been {{surrounded}} by five dogs; as they are killed they are seemingly endlessly replaced by others. The Old Man arrives, and insists {{the only way to}} rid the town of the dogs is burn down Beebe's house, which the trio <b>do</b> <b>before</b> fleeing. Back home in Seattle, Black refuses to sell his own home, telling his wife that they will move back into it together when their problems are resolved.|$|E

I just feel that TAC are doing it where it needs to happen. It really needed to be given support, and I thought that perhaps I might be well-placed to do it.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{decides to}} take his family to the new sushi bar, The Happy Sumo. After {{sampling}} most of {{the items on the}} menu, he tries sushi made from fugu. The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He tries to do it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes {{a list of all the}} things he wants to <b>do</b> <b>before</b> death.|$|E

5|$|The {{first round}} is an {{elimination}} {{game in which}} the eight cats are {{placed in front of}} a bowl of cat food. The three cats which have eaten the most food when time expires move on to the second round; those who are eliminated earn $1,000. The three remaining owners answer trivia questions for points. The format is similar to Jeopardy! with six cat-related CATegories containing questions ranging from 10 to 50 points. The lowest-scoring owner is eliminated with $10,000. The two remaining cats are each then recorded in seven different situations. The owners wager points on what their cat will <b>do</b> <b>before</b> each clip is shown. They may not wager more than half of their points on the first two questions. For the remainder, they may wager any or all of their points. The cat and owner with the highest score win $25,000, and a chance to play the bonus round; the eliminated contestant earns $15,000.|$|E
5|$|Riker {{gets up to}} {{date with}} the situation, and decides that while Ramsey and his group are at large and refusing to leave the planet, there is little they can <b>do.</b> <b>Before</b> leaving they find that one of Beata's assistants, Ariel (Patricia McPherson), has married Ramsey, and was {{followed}} by Beata's guards to their camp, where they arrested the survivors and their families. The Away Team attempt to explain to Beata the reason for Ramsey's refusal to leave. Beata and her council reject his reasoning, and threatens to execute them the following day. After failing to convince Ramsey and his group to leave with them, Riker contacts the Enterprise, in hopes to transport Ramsey and his group without their consent (despite it being {{a violation of the}} Prime Directive, and almost certainly an end to his career), but Dr. Crusher (while treating an incapacitated Geordi in the Captain's chair) refuses to allow anyone to beam aboard for fear of being infected, but allows Data, as an android, to return. Riker orders Data to take command and get the Enterprise to the Neutral Zone before it's too late.|$|E

However, the field goal kick was nullified due to an illegal procedure penalty on Oklahoma. A Sooner player did not report his temporary jersey number to the officials, which he was required to <b>do</b> <b>before</b> the ball was snapped.|$|E

25|$|Not all ceramic {{pieces are}} dry {{when they need}} cleaning. Some ceramics, {{such as those that}} are {{excavated}} archaeologically, will be damp or wet in nature. Conservators tend to remove the surface dirt before the object is completely dry. This is done because it is easier to <b>do</b> <b>before</b> the dirt hardens and because as it dried the dirt may shrink and cause physical damage to the ceramic surface. Some ceramics are kept damp until treatment can be completed.|$|E

25|$|Simeon I {{was content}} with results and {{considered}} {{that he had}} superiority over the Byzantine Empire. Despite the success, he {{realized that there was}} still a lot to <b>do</b> <b>before</b> prevailing over the Empire for good. He needed his own political and ideological base, and he consequently launched an ambitious construction program in Preslav so that it could rival Constantinople. In the meanwhile, Simeon I had also imposed his authority over Serbia in return for recognizing Petar Gojniković as its ruler. That was an important move towards reducing Byzantine influence over the Western Balkans.|$|E
25|$|Barry Horne (17 March 1952 – 5 November 2001) was an English {{animal rights}} activist.

The hunger strike took place while Horne was serving an 18-year sentence for planting incendiary devices in stores that sold fur coats and leather products, the longest sentence handed down to any animal rights activist by a British court.|$|E

25|$|Figo left Real Madrid to join Italian club Internazionale in {{the middle}} of 2005 on a free {{transfer}} after his contract with Madrid had expired. This meant that Figo would finally be able to play for a club in Italy, something he had the chance to <b>do</b> <b>before</b> his move to Barcelona, but was scuppered due to a dispute between the two clubs interested, Juventus and Parma. During the middle of 2008, Figo's compatriot José Mourinho joined Inter on a managerial level. This has been said to please Figo, as he would have several Portuguese teammates during the remainder of his stay at Inter.|$|E
25|$|Boca Juniors has had {{a long-standing}} rivalry with River Plate. The Superclásico is known {{worldwide}} as one of world football's fiercest and most important rivalries. It is particularly noted for {{the passion of the}} fans, the stands of both teams feature fireworks, coloured confetti, flags and rolls of paper. Both sets of supporters sing passionate songs (often based on popular Argentine rock band tunes) against their rivals, and the stadiums are known to bounce with the simultaneous jumping of the fans. Sometimes the games have been known to end in riots between the hardest supporters of both sides or against the police. The English newspaper The Observer put the Superclásico (played at La Bombonera) {{at the top of their}} list of 50 sporting things you must <b>do</b> <b>before</b> you die.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the plot}} twists are {{the death of}} {{apparently}} crucial characters and the reappearances of believed-to-be dead characters. However, Rachael Brown of The Atlantic said that Martin's penchant for unpredictability may make the reader grow increasingly skeptical of apparent deaths, alluding to Jon Snow's fate in A Dance with Dragons. Martin believes that bringing back a dead character necessitates a transformative experience of the character. The body may be moving, but {{some aspect of the}} spirit is changed or lost. One of the characters who has come back repeatedly from death is Beric Dondarrion, The Lightning Lord, and what has happened with him echoes with some of the other revived characters; bits of his humanity and his past lives are lost every time he comes back from death, his flesh is falling away from him, but he remembers the mission he was sent to <b>do</b> <b>before</b> death.|$|E
