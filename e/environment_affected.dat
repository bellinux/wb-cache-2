25|$|The {{conglomerates}} and sandstones of {{the formation}} are representative of an alluvial environment. The coquinas represent a shallow lacustrine environment. Similar to the Atafona Formation of the Campos Basin, the sandstones, stevensite-bearing siltstones and shales represent an alkaline lacustrine <b>environment</b> <b>affected</b> by volcanic activity. The shales represent deeper lacustrine waters in more distal areas. The alternation of the two facies implies a series of alluvial progradation-retractions into the Cretaceous carbonate lakes. The low textural and compositional maturity of conglomerates and sandstones implies the basin was supplied from areas close to the basin margins.|$|E

50|$|From the 1960s onwards {{there was}} a growing demand for greater {{consideration}} of community opinions in major decision-making. In Australia many people {{believed that they were}} not being planned 'for' but planned 'at'. (Nichols 2009). A lack of consultation made the planning system seem paternalistic and without proper consideration of how changes to the built <b>environment</b> <b>affected</b> its primary users. In Britain 'the idea that the public should participate was first raised in 1965' (Taylor, 1998, p. 86). However the level of participation is an important issue. At a minimum public workshops and hearings have now been included in almost every planning endeavour. Yet this level of consultation can simply mean information about change without detailed participation. Involvement that 'recognises an active part in plan making' (Taylor, 1998, p. 86) has not always been straightforward to achieve. Participatory design has attempted to create a platform for active participation in the design process, for end users.|$|E
5000|$|Actinomycetes (Streptomyces sp., Micromonospora sp.) {{are also}} worth mentioning. Micromonospora heviziensis for instance, a very {{powerful}} protein and cellulose decomposer, can only be found here in the world. Microbispora amethystogenes on the other hand, which accumulates iodine in its cells, {{is to be found}} in only few lakes in the world. Unfortunately this latter species has not been found in the lake since the 1980s as a result of excessive mining.Changing <b>environment</b> <b>affected</b> other bacteria as well. Micromonospora carbonacea and M. chalcea was not detected in the 1990s. Actinomycetes communities have become dominated by Micromonospora purpureochromogenes, while M. heviziensis was suppressed.

[...] - [...] are present all over the lake except for the springcave and its surroundings. Navicula cryptocephala and Navicula capitatoradiata are common diatoms in the lake. The biodiversity of the phytoplankton is poor and its biomass is low, thus the lake's trophic level ranges from oligotrophic to mesotrophic.|$|E
5000|$|Tradition {{attributed}} to the Waitaha a profound knowledge of incantations (karakia) and of the science of navigation. They painted designs in caves and named many of the distinctive features of the Otago landscape, well illustrated in the fictional tale of Rakaihautu, the great digger of lakes.The Waitaha settlement of the South Island {{seems to have been}} the latter part of a period of peace and plenty. Stack said that [...] "they increased and multiplied so rapidly that they are described as having covered the face of the land like ants".A more credible explanation might be that, on the arrival of the first Waitaha wave in the south, they found it an abundant land and, under such favourable conditions, their numbers greatly increased.However this time of prosperity was not to last. Already, {{by the end of the}} fourteenth century New Zealand's environment was beginning to change. The climate became cooler, the podocarp forest retreated, and the moa population began to decline. The changing <b>environment</b> <b>affected</b> those who relied upon moas and seals for food and forced them to develop more effective techniques for catching birds and fish. The largest settlements of the early centuries lost their importance and declined. The population declined because of emigration north to regions where one could cultivate kumara (sweet potatoes).|$|E

40|$|This work {{advances}} {{the understanding}} of compensation demanded for environmental impacts on atmosphere, lakes and rivers, soil, and ocean generated by mining, urban, fishing and agriculture activities. Our aims are to determine whether compensation demanded depends on the standard variables used {{in the field of}} risk perception (as perceived risk, public acceptability and trust in regulating authorities), and to explore whether these relationships depend on the <b>environment</b> <b>affected</b> and on the economic activity generating the impacts. General Linear Models were used to analyze survey responses from 427 citizens of Santiago, Chile. Results showed that compensation demanded depends on perceived risk, acceptability, and on the economic activity, but not on the <b>environment</b> <b>affected.</b> Acceptability depends on trust in authorities, on perceived risk and on the economic activity. Perceived risk depends on trust, the economic activity and the <b>environment</b> <b>affected.</b> Overall, environmental impacts from the mining industry are perceived as riskier, less acceptable, and have a higher compensation demanded than those generated by the other sectors. These results suggest that to achieve sustainable development, regulations should consider not only environmental impacts but also the economic activity originating them...|$|E

40|$|Takes a new {{approach}} to understanding Europe’s fertility gap - Demonstrates how the macro-level <b>environment</b> <b>affects</b> micro-level decision-making - Provides new insights into how people make decisions about having children as well as how policies affect fertility This book provides new insights into the significant gap that currently exists between desired and actual fertility in Europe. It examines how people make decisions about having children and demonstrates how the macro-level <b>environment</b> <b>affects</b> micro-level decision-making. Written by an international team of leading demographers and psychologists, the book presents the theoretical and methodological developments of a three-year, European Commission-funded project named REPRO (Reproductive Decision-Making in a Macro-Micro Perspective).

The book examines fertility intentions from quantitative and qualitative perspectives, demonstrates how the macro-level <b>environment</b> <b>affects</b> micro-level decision-making, and offers a multi-level analysis of fertility-related norms across Europe. Overall, this book offers insight into how people make decisions to have children, when they are most likely to act on their decisions, and how different social and policy settings affect their decisions and actions. It will appeal to researchers, graduate students, and policy advisors with an interest in fertility, demography, and life-course decision making...|$|R
