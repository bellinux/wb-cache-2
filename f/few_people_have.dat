5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and that <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, a <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> {{questioned}} {{this version}} of events. In the early 1980s, two books, one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, even suggested not only {{that there had been}} a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them to be convincing. Research into shipping schedules has shown that, contrary to these accusations, Wallace's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin's letter to Lyell.|$|E

25|$|A lipoma is {{a benign}} tumor made of fat tissue. They are {{generally}} soft to the touch, movable, and painless. They usually occur {{just under the}} skin but occasionally may be deeper.

25|$|We may {{be heading}} not for general {{breakdown}} but for an epoch as horribly stable as the slave empires of antiquity. James Burnham's {{theory has been}} much discussed, but <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> yet considered its ideological implications – this is, the kind of world-view, the kind of beliefs, and the social structure that would probably prevail in a State which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of 'cold war' with its neighbours.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} {{navigation}} {{is the history}} of seamanship, the art of directing vessels upon the open sea through the establishment of its position and course by means of traditional practice, geometry, astronomy, or special instruments.

25|$|The {{three main}} styles of breaststroke seen today are the {{conventional}} (flat), undulating, and wave-style. The undulating style is usually swum by extremely flexible swimmers, (e.g. Amanda Beard), and <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> {{the flexibility to}} accomplish it. The wave-style breaststroke was pioneered by Hungarian Swimming Coach Joseph Nagy. The breaststroke style was swum and made famous by Mike Barrowman when he set a world record using it, is now commonly swum by Olympians, though Australian swimmers, most prominently Leisel Jones, generally seem to shun it. Olympian Ed Moses still swims a more flat- style, despite the rapidly increasing popularity of the wave-style.|$|E

25|$|Trolls are {{the least}} {{intelligent}} of the non-magical creatures. Most of their decisions are based on their instincts. They are quick for their size and have large serrated tusks which produce a narcotic venom which renders the prey mindlessly—and defenselessly—happy. If they can, their preferred kill tactic is to slip their claws under the rib cage and pop the heart out before the muscles have time to tense up, rendering the meat mostly unharmed and tender. They have an extreme aversion to light, noise, and water. The largest pack of trolls were seen in the Eleven Wonders of the World Exhibit in a run-down part of Haven. Very <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> ever managed to single-handedly down a troll. Holly Short once did it with her helmet's eight-hundred-watt high beams, {{the shock of the}} light rendering the troll unconscious. Domovoi Butler became the only human ever to do so with a combination of medieval weaponry and modern combat techniques.|$|E

500|$|The Fire Emblem {{series is}} highly popular in Japan. In 2007, a Japanese public poll named Mystery of the Emblem {{as one of}} the country's All Time Top 100 video games. Speaking to USGamer, Massive Chalice creator Brad Muir commented on how Fire Emblem had {{influenced}} the game, referring to it as [...] " [...] venerable strategy series", making positive reference to its gameplay and character relationships.

500|$|... {{is a form}} of jutsu {{introduced}} during Part II of {{the series}} that is taught from summons who have obtained the title of sage, two of which are the Great Toad Sage and the White Snake Sage. A user can master Senjutsu by combining their chakra with [...] "natures energy", a task that can only be completed by ninja with particularly large chakra reserves who learn to harmonize with nature by remaining perfectly still – anyone else who tries is quickly overwhelmed by this natural energy, as seen when Jugo's Clan rendered mentally unstable with fits of rage. For those who learn under the Great Toad Sage, the overdose of natural energy turns them into giant stone toad statues though this effect can be neutralized with the sage's beating stick. If the user is able to use Senjutsu, they only have {{a certain amount of time}} before the natural energies are expended, as the user will need to move around the battlefield and Senjutsu requires to user to remain still. Workarounds for this shortfall include summoning frog assistants or using shadow clones to help gather the energy. Those who master Senjutsu are able to enter a state called [...] where user adopts the physical features of the animal mentor. Because of the difficulty in maintaining the natural energy, only a <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been able to properly master Senjutsu; Naruto Uzumaki is stated to be the first Senjutsu user under the tutelage of the Great Toad Sage, Gamamaru, who has achieved this feat. Ninja who are able to use Senjutsu include Jiraiya, Minato Namikaze, and Hashirama Senju; Kabuto Yakushi are also able to use Senjutsu, seemingly without the aid of an animal mentor. Because the chakra utilized is from the natural world, Senjutsu is an effective weapon against the Ten-Tails and Yin-Yang Style users.|$|E
