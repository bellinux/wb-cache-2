60|$|These {{examples}} will {{illustrate the}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> {{it is the}} object of the present work to deal with. Every continent, every country, and every island on the globe, offers similar problems of greater or less complexity and interest, and the time has now arrived when their solution can be attempted with some prospect of success. Many {7} years study of this class of subjects has convinced me that there is no short and easy method of dealing with them; because they are, in their very nature, the visible outcome and residual product of the whole past history of the earth. If we take the organic productions of a small island, or of any very limited tract of country, such as a moderate-sized country parish, we have, in their relations and affinities--in {{the fact that they are}} there and others are not there, a problem which involves all the migrations of these species and their ancestral forms--all the vicissitudes of climate and all the changes of sea and land which have affected those migrations--the whole series of actions and reactions which have determined the preservation of some forms and the extinction of others,--in fact the whole history of the earth, inorganic and organic, throughout a large portion of geological time.|$|E

I {{feel much}} {{inclined}} to pause at this point, {{to answer the}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> and objections which I know must be rising in your mind, respecting the authority supposed to be lodged in the persons of the officers just specified. But I can neither define, nor justify to you, the powers I would desire to see given to them, till I state to you the kind of laws {{they would have to}} enforce: of which the first group should be directed to the prevention of all kinds of thieving; but chiefly of the occult and polite methods of it; and, of all occult methods, chiefly, the making and selling of bad goods. No form of theft is so criminal as this--none so deadly to the State. If you break into a man's house and steal a hundred pounds' worth of plate, he knows his loss, and there is an end (besides that you take your risk of punishment for your gain, like a man). And if you do it bravely and openly, and habitually live by such inroad, you may retain nearly every moral and manly virtue, and become a heroic rider and reiver, and hero of song. But if you swindle me out of twenty shillings' worth of quality on each of a hundred bargains, I lose my hundred pounds all the same, and I get a hundred untrustworthy articles besides, which will fail me and injure me in all manner of ways, when I least expect it; and you, having done your thieving basely, are corrupted by the guilt of it to the very heart's core.|$|E
