25|$|I am {{now before}} {{you in a}} public character. If, in that situation, I have given you offence, you have an undoubted right to call for an apology or defence; but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> erred as a private individual, {{the nature of that}} error cannot with {{discretion}} come under your notice. It will probably be investigated by a court, constituted to hear both the accuser and the accused, and where justice only can be done.|$|E
25|$|Heinz Hopf, who {{had been}} in Berlin before his {{appointment}} to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held - as is clear from oral statements and also from letters - Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya {{on the occasion of the}} re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. - <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I say that I sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him.|$|E
25|$|Look, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a {{triangle}} in midfield – Claude Makélélé behind {{and two others}} just in front – I will always have an advantage against a pure 4–4–2 where the central midfielders are side by side. That's because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makélélé, who is between the lines. If nobody comes to him {{he can see the}} whole pitch and has time. If he gets closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team's wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs. There is nothing a pure 4–4–2 can do to stop things.|$|E

25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E
25|$|After my father's {{appointment}} by {{his homeland}} as state {{official in the}} customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed {{in the study of}} calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.|$|E
500|$|Diệm went on {{to answer}} a {{question}} about his religious convictions by declaring his adherence to Catholicism and saying [...] "I have always found the principles of my religion a great inspiration, and, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> achieved anything in my political career, I owe it all to those principles". His comments were widely trumpeted in Catholic newspapers, which cited it as the reason why he was able to stop a communist takeover of South Vietnam.|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} more," [...] said Dick. [...] "I {{have told you}} all there is. I love you so truly {{that it seems to}} me as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been born, as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> lived, as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> grown and had worked, simply that I might be able to come to you and say, I love you.

6000|$|... 'What <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{found out}} {{one who knew}} your brother's secret; who knew the manner of his flight, who knew where he and the {{companion}} of his flight were gone? What <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made him utter all his knowledge, word by word, before his enemy, concealed to hear it? What <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> sat by at the time, looking into this enemy's face, and seeing it change till it was scarcely human? What <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen him rush away, mad, in pursuit? What <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew, now, {{that he was on}} his road, more fiend than man, and must, in so many hours, come up with him?' ...|$|R
500|$|Following {{defeat in}} the {{previous}} year's race, Oxford's first in eleven years, American Chris Clark was determined to gain revenge: [...] "Next year we're gonna kick ass ... Cambridge's ass. Even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{to go home and}} bring the whole US squad with me." [...] He recruited another four American post-graduates: three international-class rowers (Dan Lyons, Chris Huntington and Chris Penney) and a cox (Jonathan Fish), in an attempt to put together the fastest Boat Race crew {{in the history of the}} contest.|$|E
500|$|As MP for Bristol South East, Benn helped organise the 1963 Bristol Bus Boycott {{against the}} colour {{bar of the}} Bristol Omnibus Company against {{employing}} Black British and British Asian drivers. Benn {{said that he would}} [...] "stay off the buses, even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to find a bike", and Labour leader Harold Wilson also told an anti-apartheid rally in London he was [...] "glad that so many Bristolians are supporting the [...] campaign", adding that he [...] "wish them every success".|$|E
500|$|There {{was also}} {{controversy}} at the rear-end of the grid, as Spyker asked the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) {{to look at}} the new updates that were put on the Super Aguri at Indianapolis to see whether the Aguri team are receiving current Honda parts. On Saturday, Super Aguri's managing director Daniel Audetto said [...] "We have rules – they [...] can just protest.

500|$|The episode {{opens with}} a quote from the French philosopher Ernest Renan, taken from A Skeptic's Prayer—"O Lord, {{if there is a}} Lord, save my soul, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a soul". Guest star Steve Makaj, who played one of the state troopers in the episode, would have a minor {{recurring}} role in The X-Files as assassin Scott Ostelhoff. Fellow guest actor John Pyper-Ferguson would reappear in Millennium second season, playing an unrelated character in [...] "Anamnesis". Pyper-Ferguson also appeared in [...] "Leviathan", an episode of Millennium creator Chris Carter's next series, Harsh Realm.|$|E
500|$|Bill Szymczyk's has {{frequently}} been noted as {{the sort of}} producer who pushes bands to expand their musical horizons; he has been brought in with the specific intent of changing a band's sound. He himself has credited this tendency to his lack of musical knowledge, stating: [...] "I'm a professional listener. I listen and I react. I never was a musician, so I don't bring any preconceived prejudices to the table; I don't favour the guitar over the keyboard, and so forth. I just listen {{and try to figure}} out <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> anything I can bring to a song." ...|$|E
500|$|At one point, Chabon {{submitted}} a 672-page draft to his agent and editor, who disliked the work. Chabon had problems dropping the novel, though. [...] "It was really scary," [...] he said later. [...] "I'd already {{signed a contract}} and been paid all this money. And then I'd gotten a divorce and half the money was already with my ex-wife. My instincts were telling me, This book is fucked. Just drop it. But I didn't, because I thought, What <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to give the money back?" [...] "I used {{to go down to}} my office and fantasize about all the books I could write instead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{look at me}} that way," [...] pleaded the pirate, [...] "as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{done the}} deed. You know I didn't. I swear <b>I</b> didn't! <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been there, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> saved Orlando at the cost of--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{has done}} wonders for the country. Listen to this." [...] And Mr. Lavender would read as follows: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> fifty sons <b>I</b> {{would give them}} all. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> forty daughters they should nurse and scrub and weed and fill shells; <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> thirty country-houses they should all be hospitals; <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> twenty pens <b>I</b> would use them all day long; if had ten voices they should never cease to inspire and aid my country." ...|$|R
500|$|... {{having been}} made without argument, {{and by a}} {{majority}} only of the court, I hope {{that it is not}} an improper course to bring the subject again in review for a more solemn decision, as it {{is not a question of}} mere ordinary import, but vitally affects the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States; a jurisdiction which they cannot lawfully enlarge or diminish. I shall submit, with the utmost cheerfulness, to the judgment of my brethren, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> hazarded a rash opinion, I have the consolation to know, that their superior learning and ability will save the public from an injury by my error.|$|E
500|$|... "Concentrate and Ask Again" [...] {{featured}} {{guest star}} Omid Abtahi as telepathic Simon Phillips, his only {{credit for the}} series. Guest actor Kevin Corrigan returned as recurring character Sam Weiss. The episode featured guest stars Jody Thompson and Paul Jarrett as the new characters Sara Downey and Warren Blake, respectively. Thompson called the part [...] "the kind of role that actors dream of". She described the episode, [...] "The material was so compelling and perfectly written {{it was a matter}} of not getting in the way of what the creators had created. I’m anxious about how it will come off. Truthfully, I’ve been torturing myself, wondering <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> somehow ruined the beauty of what I read in the script".|$|E
500|$|Following the {{publication}} of these articles, Udin began to complain of what he considered a campaign of official harassment. Some district officials had reportedly spoken to him about his writings, and others had threatened him with a libel action. As {{a result of this}} perceived harassment, Udin had filed multiple complaints with the Legal Aid Institute (...) in Yogyakarta. Udin had also been offered bribes to cease his reporting and received threats of violence. When his wife asked him about the threats, he responded, [...] "What I write is the facts. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to die, I will accept it." [...] The night of his murder, two men came to the Bernas office looking for him, but a secretary sent them away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{said that}} I would {{do as you}} bade me, and so I will. <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> done it sooner <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> known that you wished it. <b>I</b> would never <b>have</b> worn it at all <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> thought that you disliked it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop," [...] she said, gently.
