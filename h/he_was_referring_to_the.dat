25|$|The word Finn {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in the form fenni in the 1st century AD by Tacitus, the Roman historian. However {{it is possible that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people of northern Europe in general, particularly the Lappic or Sami people. After that the name finni is used by Claudius Ptolemaeus (around 150) and the Eastern Roman writer Jordanes in his Getica (551). References to Finnic tribes become much more numerous from the Viking era (800-1050). It was not until about 1171 that the word Finni was employed to mean the Finns.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ship Polaris's return voyage southward {{down the}} Kennedy channel. This {{does not answer}} when it was named. However, the ship's doctor {{and leader of the}} {{scientific}} part of the expedition, Emil Bessels, wrote of it in his own book, Die amerikanische Nordpol-Expedition (1879). On page 124 he tells that on August 29, 1871, on the voyage north through Kennedy Channel, the Polaris sailed between Grinnell-land (Ellesmere Island) and a small unknown island which they later named Hans Island, after his native Greenlandic helper, Hans Hendrik.|$|E
25|$|In December 1947 Bevin hoped (in vain) {{that the}} USA would support Britain’s “strategic, {{political}} and economic position in the Middle East”. In May 1950 Bevin told the London meeting of foreign ministers that “the United States authorities had recently seemed disposed to press us to adopt a greater measure of economic integration with Europe than we thought wise” (<b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Schuman Plan {{to set up the}} European Coal and Steel Community). In May 1950 he said that because of links with USA and the Commonwealth Britain was “different in character from other European nations and fundamentally incapable of wholehearted integration with them”.|$|E

25|$|As the {{takeoff roll}} began, {{the first officer}} noted several times to the captain that the {{instrument}} panel readings he was seeing {{did not seem to}} reflect reality (<b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that the plane did not appear to have developed as much power as it needed for takeoff, despite the instruments indicating otherwise). The captain dismissed these concerns and let the takeoff proceed. Investigators later determined that there was plenty of time and space on the runway for the captain to have aborted the takeoff, and criticized his refusal to listen to his first officer, who was correct that the instrument panel readings were wrong. The pilot was told not to delay because another aircraft was 2.5 miles out (4km) on final approach to the same runway. The following is a transcript of Flight 90's cockpit voice recorder during the plane's acceleration down the runway.|$|E
500|$|When Juvenal {{complained that}} the Roman people had {{exchanged}} their political liberty for [...] "bread and circuses", <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state-provided grain dole and the circenses, events held in the entertainment venue called a circus in Latin. The largest such venue in Rome was the Circus Maximus, the setting of horse races, chariot races, the equestrian Troy Game, staged beast hunts (venationes), athletic contests, gladiator combat, and historical re-enactments. From earliest times, several religious festivals had featured games (ludi), primarily horse and chariot races (ludi circenses). Although their entertainment value tended to overshadow ritual significance, the races remained part of archaic religious observances that pertained to agriculture, initiation, and the cycle of birth and death.|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} the band {{reportedly}} spent afternoons getting stoned and watching Three Stooges reruns. One day, they had a post-Stooges meeting {{to try to come}} up with a name. Kramer said when he was in school he would write the word aerosmith all over his notebooks. The name had popped into his head after listening to Harry Nilsson's album Aerial Ballet, which featured jacket art of a circus performer jumping out of a biplane. Initially, Kramer's bandmates were unimpressed; they all thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sinclair Lewis novel they were required to read in high school English class. [...] "No, not Arrowsmith," [...] Kramer explained. [...] "A-E-R-O...Aerosmith." [...] The band settled upon this name after also considering [...] "the Hookers" [...] and [...] "Spike Jones." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{his work}} on the Précis, Champollion {{realized}} that in order to advance further he needed more texts, and transcriptions of better quality. This caused him to spend the next years visiting collections and monuments in Italy, where he realized that many of the transcriptions from which he had been working had been inaccurate – hindering the decipherment; he made a point of making his own copies of as many texts as possible. During his time in Italy, he met the Pope, who congratulated him on having done a [...] "great service to the Church," [...] by which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> counter arguments he had provided against the challengers to the Biblical chronology. Champollion was ambivalent, but the Pope's support helped him in his efforts to secure funds for an expedition.|$|E
500|$|The English naturalist Hugh Edwin Strickland {{assigned}} the [...] "Indian ravens" [...] to the hornbill genus Buceros in 1848, because he interpreted the projection {{on the forehead}} in the 1601 illustration as a horn. The Dutch and the French also referred to South American macaws as [...] "Indian ravens" [...] during the 17th century, and the name was used for hornbills by Dutch, French, and English speakers in the East Indies. Sir Thomas Herbert referred to the broad-billed parrot as [...] "Cacatoes" [...] (cockatoo) in 1634, with the description [...] "birds like Parrats, fierce and indomitable", but naturalists did not realise that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same bird. Even after subfossils of a parrot matching the descriptions were found, French zoologist Emile Oustalet argued that the [...] "Indian raven" [...] was a hornbill whose remains awaited discovery. The Mauritian ornithologist France Staub was in favour of this idea as late as 1993. No remains of hornbills have ever been found on the island, and apart from an extinct species from New Caledonia, hornbills are not found on any oceanic islands.|$|E
500|$|Mark O'Hare {{directed}} and animated the walk cycles {{in the beginning}} of the episode. The cycle originated when supervising producer at the time Derek Drymon called O'Hare. O'Hare said [...] "Derek would call me out of the blue for freelance, and it was tough to know the context of stuff." [...] He remembered the crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was told to do [...] "some kind of weird walk to it." [...] He said [...] "I animated this bizarre SpongeBob walk and turned it in, and that was that." [...] Eventually, Drymon saw the cycle and referred to it as [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] walk. O'Hare had no idea what Drymon was talking about until he learned it was already used in an episode. O'Hare said [...] "so I just figured that it ended up on the cutting room floor, like a lot of stuff you end up doing in animation. I had no idea that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> actual name of the show [...]" [...] The live action scenes were directed by Mark Osborne (brother of the episode's storyboard director Kent Osborne), and were hosted by Tom Kenny in character as Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.|$|E

500|$|Marketing to {{an influx}} of {{immigrant}} workers, owners abandoned [...] "adult only" [...] policies (prohibiting children), listed vacancies in Spanish, and reduced rents. Despite the rent reduction, a July 17, 1988 Houston Chronicle article stated that rates for poorly maintained apartments in Gulfton and other Houston areas were comparable to well-maintained apartments {{in other parts of}} the city. According to Gaines, complexes in Gulfton began to cater to illegal immigrants and landlords allowed renters to [...] "double-up" [...] housing (several individuals and/or families living in a unit). John Goodner, a Houston city council member who represented a district that included Gulfton at that time, said that more demographic changes occurred within his district in the years leading up to 1988 than in any other part of the city. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shift in the demographics of various apartment complexes. Goodner said that the complex owners were unconcerned about this development as long as the rent payments were made. Landlords had difficulty filling apartment complexes even if they did not require background checks. Many banks and lending institutions owned foreclosed apartments and failed to properly maintain them, considering it [...] "pouring money down a perceived rat hole." [...] Gaines added that many complexes deferred maintenance.|$|E
500|$|Scalia {{calls the}} Court's {{conclusion}} {{to hear the}} case [...] "patently erroneous". His first argument relies {{on the part of the}} Detainee Treatment Act (DTA) (effective December 30, 2005) that states [...] "o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba." [...] §1005(e)(1), 119 Stat. 2742. Scalia's opinion is that this clause suffices to deny the Supreme Court jurisdiction over the case, calling the majority's reading [...] of the effectiveness provisions of §1005(h), a [...] "mess". He cites Bruner v. United States and other cases granting [...] "immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation". He wrote that in interpreting the language in the DTA, the majority ignored Supreme Court precedents which established that a statute excluding jurisdiction applies to pending cases unless it has clear language saying it does not. Scalia claimed that the majority had made this interpretation [...] "for the flimsiest of reasons". <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> majority's use of Senate floor debate records to bolster their interpretation, writing that it [...] "makes no difference" [...] that the language in support of his position was inserted into the Congressional Record after the law was voted upon. He also accuses the majority of ignoring the President's Signing Statement.|$|E
500|$|At the September 2016 Family Research Council Action Values Voter Summit (VVS) in Washington, DC, where Republican {{presidential and}} vice presidential {{candidates}} Donald Trump and Mike Pence also spoke, Bevin [...] "both lamented {{and called for}} revolution and bloodshed to 'redeem' what [...] be lost" [...] if Hillary Clinton were to be victorious in the 2016 presidential election, according to one review of Bevin's speech. He used and echoed the language about [...] "the tree of liberty" [...] being refreshed by the blood of patriots and addressed his own family in the same regard– [...] "I have nine children ... it might be their blood [...] is needed." [...] A second review of the speech said Bevin [...] "urged young Americans especially to 'be bold' and to avoid the temptation to be silent {{in the face of}} left-wing ideologues attempting to remake America." [...] This review continued through [...] "Neville Chamberlains in the world" [...] contrasting with [...] "a Winston Churchill" [...] and [...] "It's a slippery slope.... First, we're killing [...] children , then it's 'Don't ask, don't tell,' now it's this gender-bending kind of 'don't be a bigot,' 'don't be unreasonable,' 'don't be unenlightened.'" [...] Before the final call to service and sacrifice in the speech, in this account, an audience member and then Bevin addressed [...] "hose blood will be shed" [...] in, as another account put it, [...] "violent metaphor." [...] Afterwards, Bevin was asked about the [...] "blood ... shed" [...] part of the speech and, according to a summary, [...] "appeared to say <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cost paid by men and women in uniform." [...] A third account of the VVS appearance said he had spoken without notes or teleprompter. Another account reported that he [...] "referenced the rise of the Nazis preceding the Holocaust twice, invoking German pastor Martin Niemöller's oft-cited quote that ends, 'then they came for me– {{and there was no one}} left to speak for me.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Semantic and {{episodic memory}} {{together}} {{make up the}} category of declarative memory, {{which is one of}} the two major divisions of memory – the other is implicit memory.

Knowing is more factual (semantic) whereas remembering is a feeling that is located in the past (episodic).|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "keel" [...] {{comes from}} Old English cēol, Old Norse kjóll, = [...] "ship" [...] or [...] "keel".
