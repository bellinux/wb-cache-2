5|$|Coulter {{knew the}} NK 15th Division {{had crossed the}} Taegu lateral {{corridor}} at Yongch'on and was heading {{in the direction of}} Kyongju. On September 6, he ordered the US 21st Infantry to attack the next day up the valley and bordering <b>hills</b> <b>that</b> lead northwest from Kyongju into the high mountain mass in the direction of Yongch'on. When it attacked there on September 7 the 21st Infantry encountered virtually no opposition.|$|E
5|$|The land {{immediately}} {{south and}} west of the town {{is part of the}} Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is traversed by the South Dorset Ridgeway, part of the South West Coast Path. There are over five hundred ancient monuments along the chalk <b>hills</b> <b>that</b> form the ridgeway, including barrows, stone circles and hillforts; many archaeological finds from the area are on view at the Dorset County Museum in Dorchester.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} {{members of the}} group include Ernest Zobole, a painter from Ystrad, whose expressionist work was deeply rooted in the {{juxtaposition}} of the industrialised buildings of the valleys set against the green <b>hills</b> <b>that</b> surround them. Also from the Rhondda Fawr was sculptor Robert Thomas; born in Cwmparc, his heavy cast statues have become icons of contemporary Wales, with many of his works publicly displayed in Cardiff.|$|E

5|$|US223 {{passes out}} of flat farmlands into the Irish Hills region as the highway runs {{northeast}} of Manitou Beach as the roadway rounds the northern shore of Devils Lake. The Irish Hills region has gently rolling <b>hills</b> <b>that</b> transition to forests from farms. Southeast of Somerset US223 meets US127 and ends.

5|$|I-96 {{passes through}} {{an area with}} several lakes as it crosses into Oakland County. This area {{includes}} the Island Lake State Recreation Area {{to the south and}} the Kensington Metropark {{to the north of the}} freeway in an area where it crosses the Huron River. The Interstate runs through Wixom into Novi, where it passes to the south of the Twelve Oaks Mall. Southeast of the mall, I-96 enters a complex interchange on the border between Novi and Farmington <b>Hills</b> <b>that</b> connects it to M-5 (Haggerty Connector), I-275 and I-696 (Reuther Freeway). The trunkline drops a lane in each direction as it enters the interchange and turns southward. The freeway then merges into I-275 and increases to four lanes in each direction running south in Farmington Hills.|$|E
5|$|In the stalemate, the Belgians {{studied the}} Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and {{artillery}} spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their artillery barrages were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue {{up to an}} hour after they withdrew. On 21 April, the Italians launched a large counterattack. After a two-hour bombardment, Eritrean troops armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades and covered by Galla snipers penetrated the Belgians' left and right flanks. With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering the brunt of the assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of <b>hills</b> <b>that</b> obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized.|$|E

5|$|It {{was in the}} Matabeleland {{region in}} Zimbabwe that, during the Second Matabele War, Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting, and Frederick Russell Burnham, the American born Chief of Scouts for the British Army, first met and began their lifelong friendship. In mid-June 1896, during a {{scouting}} patrol in the Matobo Hills, Burnham began teaching Baden-Powell woodcraft. Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed {{the concept of a}} broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. It was also during this time in the Matobo <b>Hills</b> <b>that</b> Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 1, with only the {{shattered}} remnants of E Company at hand, the US 9th Infantry Regiment, US 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan. Division commander Major General Laurence B. Keiser in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment. The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to Yongsan. The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low <b>hills</b> <b>that</b> arched around Yongsan on the northwest.|$|E

5|$|Past Richburg, NY275 {{continues}} on a northeasterly track through the rural town of Wirt, {{running along the}} base of a narrow, largely undeveloped valley surrounding Little Genesee Creek as East Notch Road. The highway slowly increases in elevation for about , intersecting with the western terminus of CR8 (Inavale Road) and passing a handful of farms on its way toward East Notch, a gap between two large <b>hills</b> <b>that</b> serves as Little Genesee Creek's source. It eventually turns north to traverse the pass before winding its way down the opposite side. A short distance later, NY275 intersects with the northern terminus of CR8 as it curves to take a northwesterly track into the town of Friendship.|$|E
5|$|Patch {{initiated}} a new offensive {{just as the}} 38th Division began {{to withdraw from the}} inland ridges and <b>hills</b> <b>that</b> it had occupied. On 20 January, the 25th Infantry Division, under Major General J. Lawton Collins, attacked several hills, designated Hills 87, 88, and 89 by the Americans, that formed a ridge that dominated Kokumbona. Encountering much lighter resistance than anticipated, the Americans seized the three hills by the morning of 22 January. Shifting forces to exploit the unexpected breakthrough, Collins quickly continued the advance and captured the next two hills, 90 and 91, by nightfall, placing the Americans in position to isolate and capture Kokumbona and trap the Japanese 2nd Division.|$|E
5|$|Somewhat later, andesitic lavas {{poured out}} {{from what is}} now Reading Peak and mainly flowed {{to the south and}} east, {{reaching}} the head of Warner Valley. By this time, the park's eastern portion had been transformed into a relatively flat plain. The activity was followed by an eruption of the Eastern basalts from volcanoes east of the park. These thick flows have subsequently eroded to produce rugged <b>hills</b> <b>that</b> limit the park on the east. Taken together, these various flows built the lava plateau that the Lassen volcanic area is located on.|$|E

5|$|Stafford Meadow Brook {{begins on}} the Pocono Plateau. It is a {{mountain}} stream that flows the Moosic Mountains in Simersons Gap. At points, it also flows through a gorge or through dense brush. Mountains in the watershed include Coon Hill and Scrub Oak Mountain. The topography of the watershed is mountainous, with high steep <b>hills</b> <b>that</b> have been rounded by glaciation. The stream's valley is narrow. It {{is one of}} the larger tributaries of the Lackawanna River. It is a second-order stream.|$|E
5|$|Upon exiting Lackawanna County, Spring Brook enters Pittston Township, Luzerne County. It {{receives}} the tributary Monument Creek {{from the left}} and turns north-northwest for a few miles, flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 502. On this stretch, it leaves behind the <b>hills</b> <b>that</b> it flows through, crosses Pennsylvania Route 502, and exits Luzerne County. Upon exiting Luzerne County, the stream enters Moosic, Lackawanna County and continues flowing north-northwest and {{receives the}} tributary Covey Swamp Creek from the right. The stream then turns west-southwest for a short distance before turning south and then west, crossing Interstate 81. It then turns northwest for a few tenths of a mile, crossing US Route 11 before reaching its confluence with the Lackawanna River.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's statue {{at the end}} of Worcester High Street stands {{facing the}} cathedral, only yards from where his father's shop once stood. Another statue of the {{composer}} by Rose Garrard {{is at the top of}} Church Street in Malvern, overlooking the town and giving visitors an opportunity to stand next to the composer in the shadow of the <b>Hills</b> <b>that</b> he so often regarded. In September 2005, a third statue sculpted by Jemma Pearson was unveiled near Hereford Cathedral in honour of his many musical and other associations with the city. It depicts Elgar with his bicycle. From 1999 until early 2007, new Bank of England twenty pound notes featured a portrait of Elgar. The change to remove his image generated controversy, particularly because 2007 was the 150th anniversary of Elgar's birth. From 2007 the Elgar notes were phased out, ceasing to be legal tender on 30 June 2010.|$|E

The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low <b>hills</b> <b>that</b> arched around Yongsan on the northwest. Disorganized US forces were ordered to pull back to Yongsan. The road to Miryang came south out of Yongsan, bent around the western tip of this mountain, and then ran eastward along its southern base. In its position, they not only commanded the town but also its exit, the road to Miryang. North Koreans had also approached Yongsan from the south. That night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground around Yongsan and entered the town from the south.|$|E
5|$|The French had {{committed}} 10,800 troops, with more reinforcements totaling nearly 16,000 men, {{to the defense}} of a monsoon-affected valley surrounded by heavily wooded <b>hills</b> <b>that</b> had not been secured. Artillery as well as ten M24 Chaffee light tanks and numerous aircraft were committed to the garrison. The garrison included French regular troops (notably elite paratroop units plus artillery), Foreign Legionnaires, Algerian and Moroccan tirailleurs, and locally recruited Indochinese infantry. All told, the Viet Minh had moved 50,000 regular troops into the hills surrounding the valley, totaling five divisions including the 351st Heavy Division, which was made up entirely of heavy artillery. Artillery and antiaircraft guns, which outnumbered the French artillery by about four to one, were moved into positions overlooking the valley. The French came under direct and sporadic Viet Minh artillery fire {{for the first time on}} 31 January 1954, and patrols encountered the Viet Minh in all directions. The French were surrounded.|$|E
5|$|The main {{geological}} {{component of}} the Mendips is Carboniferous Limestone. It represents {{the remnants of a}} much higher range of <b>hills</b> <b>that</b> existed hundreds of millions years ago. This has allowed the formation of features such as Cheddar Gorge, Ebbor Gorge and Burrington Combe. There are a wide variety of caves and swallet holes caused by dissolution of the rock by water. Further east there are Silurian volcanoes, Carboniferous Limestone outcrops, Variscan thrust tectonics, Permo-Triassic conglomerates, sediment-filled fissures, a classic unconformity, Jurassic clays and limestones, Cretaceous Greensand and chalk topped with Tertiary remnants including Sarsen Stones. These sediments have yielded a fairly rich fossil fauna of brachiopods and trilobites indicating that they were deposited in a shallow marine sea into which the lavas were extruded. The rocks are quarried at Moons Hill near Stoke St Michael for aggregate.|$|E
