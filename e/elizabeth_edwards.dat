5|$|Big Girls Don't Cry {{is divided}} into twelve chapters, telling a roughly chronological recount of the 2008 election, {{interwoven}} with Traister's own experiences and perspectives as well as analysis from other political commentators. She focuses on four key women involved in the election: Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, Michelle Obama and <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards.</b>|$|E
5|$|Catherine Russell, {{a former}} {{adviser to the}} Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was named Biden's {{chief of staff for}} her Second Lady role. Courtney O’Donnell, a former {{spokesperson}} for Howard Dean and <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards,</b> was named her communications director and Kirsten White, a lawyer at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, her policy director. As Second Lady, Biden has a staff of eight overall and occupies a corner suite in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.|$|E
25|$|When Edwards first {{admitted}} to the affair, he stated that Elizabeth was in remission from breast cancer. However, {{it became clear that}} the affair was still ongoing, even after he and his wife made a joint announcement that her cancer had returned and was found to be incurable. <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards</b> died on December 7, 2010.|$|E

After the admission from Edwards that he fathered a child with Hunter, Edwards' wife, <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards,</b> announced a separation from her husband, with an intention to file for divorce. On January 25, 2010, the existence of an explicit sex tape, featuring Edwards and Hunter, was publicly reported.|$|E
25|$|Finally, a {{distinguished}} lecture series created {{as part of}} Carson's student body president platform was renamed in her honor {{in the fall of}} 2010 by the university's Executive Branch of Student Government. The series aimed to bring big-name speakers to campus in order to challenge students and spark discussion. Speakers have included <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards,</b> Greg Mortenson, Fatou Bensouda, Mika Brzezinski, and most recently, former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs.|$|E
25|$|Wendy Rose {{was born}} Bronwen <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards</b> on May 7, 1948, in Oakland, California. Though she is of Hopi and Miwok ancestry, Rose {{was raised in}} a {{predominantly}} white community in San Francisco. Growing up in an urban environment far removed from reservation life and Native American relations gave her little to no access to her native roots as a child. A theme at the forefront of her poetry, she comes from a mixed-blood family. Though her father is a full-blood Hopi, Rose was denied membership in her father’s tribe because ancestry is determined matrilineally. Her mother was partly Miwok, but refused to acknowledge her American Indian heritage (instead she acknowledged her European ancestry including English, Scottish, Irish, and German extraction).|$|E

25|$|Claude McKay {{was born}} in Nairne Castle near James Hill in upper Clarendon Parish, Jamaica. McKay {{referred}} to his home village as Sunny Ville, a name given to the area by locals. He was the youngest child of Thomas Francis McKay and Hannah Ann <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards,</b> well-to-do farmers who had enough property to qualify to vote. His parents were also active and well-respected members of the Baptist faith. Thomas was a strict, religious man who struggled to develop close relationships with his children due to his serious nature. In contrast, Claude's mother had a warmth that allowed her to give love freely to all of her children. Thomas was of Ashanti descent, while Claude's mother traced her ancestry to Madagascar. Claude recounted that his father would often share stories of Ashanti customs with the family.|$|E
500|$|Harvey {{was born}} in Upper Sydenham, Kent, the son of Commander John William Francis Harvey, RN and <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards</b> Lavington Harvey née Penny. At age 11 in 1884, Harvey moved {{with his family to}} Southsea and he {{attended}} Portsmouth Grammar School, achieving excellent academic results and showing proficiency in languages and debating. [...] Harvey was descended from a military family; his great-great-grandfather John Harvey had been killed in the Glorious First of June in 1794 and his great-grandfather Admiral Sir Edward Harvey, GCB, RN and grandfather Captain John Harvey of the 9th Regiment of Foot were also prominent military figures.|$|E
500|$|Traister also {{discusses}} {{the wives of}} men involved in politics: Michelle Obama, the wife of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama, and <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards,</b> the wife of John Edwards, another candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. Traister contrasts the Obamas' relationship with that of Hillary and ex-President Bill Clinton. She argues that Michelle Obama's candidness led many women voters to feel they had {{more in common with}} her than Hillary Clinton. She compares Elizabeth Edwards' public image to that of Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton, and criticizes her for [...] "enabl her husband's deception" [...] about his extramarital affair.|$|E

They were the ancestors of the Leighton Baronets of Wattlesborough.|$|R
50|$|Mary began {{living with}} her sister <b>Elizabeth</b> Porter <b>Edwards</b> in Springfield, Illinois in October 1839. Elizabeth, married to Ninian W. Edwards, son of a former governor, served as Mary's guardian. Mary was popular among the gentry of Springfield, and though she was courted by the rising young lawyer and Democratic Party {{politician}} Stephen A. Douglas and others, she chose Abraham Lincoln, a fellow Whig.|$|R
500|$|Michelle Gibson and Deborah Townsend Meem, {{authors of}} Femme/Butch, commended the video for showing {{a shift in}} power between the sexes, declaring that [...] "Madonna assertively claimed all {{possible}} gender space like Marlene Dietrich." [...] Professor Carol Vernallis noted in her book, Experiencing Music Video that the diffused light around Madonna in the video was adopted to mimic the diffusion of sound and make the borders around Madonna appear soft, and her body spread outwards. In the book The 1980s, authors Bob Batchelor and Scott Stoddart called [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as one of Madonna's most challenging videos. They noted the video for its [...] "exploitation" [...] of the male body and sexualizing them {{as an object of}} desire. The authors also added that the video [...] "was a colorful homage to the term gaze, but Madonna is the bearer of it—not men." [...] Batchelor explained that the scenes of Madonna performing alone in her room and atop the stairs suggested that she was the object of the gaze, however it seemed to them that she was mocking the movement of the men below. [...] "She controls the mind of the men below, with a form of siren's song of female empowerment, signalling that the men do move in unison to her song", Stoddart concluded. <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards,</b> {{one of the authors of}} Visual Sense: A Cultural Reader, explained that the shot of Madonna crawling on the floor, while another image of hers watches from a nearby sofa, illustrated the mutation that Madonna's image was undergoing. According to her, Madonna was acting out self-consciousness by [...] "watching herself". She concluded by saying, [...] "'Express Yourself' gives its viewers a whole new series of image references to traditional American gendered and sexual icons—male and female—and a whole new level of irony." [...] Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss, authors of On Fashion, deconstructed the video for its display of the artificiality of images of gender. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine reviewed the video in 2003, and commented that the video [...] "is the embodiment of 'queer chic', a bombastic masterpiece that heralds Madonna's uncanny ability to use her consumer-driven image to code her feminist politics." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{an op-ed}} {{published}} on April 27, 2008 in The New York Times, <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards</b> {{wrote that the}} media covered much more of [...] "the rancor of the campaign" [...] and [...] "amount of money spent" [...] than [...] "the candidates' priorities, policies and principles." [...] Author Erica Jong commented that [...] "our press has become a sea of triviality, meanness and irrelevant chatter." [...] A Gallup poll released on May 29, 2008 also estimated that more Americans felt the media was being harder on Hillary Clinton than they were towards Barack Obama. Time Magazine columnist Mark Halperin stated that the media during the 2008 election had a [...] "blind, almost slavish" [...] worship of Obama.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} {{one of a handful of}} Fox {{affiliates}} who initially declined to broadcast the controversial, two-part interview special on O.J. Simpson, If I Did It, Here's How It Happened. It was set to air on November 27 and 29, 2006, before the network pulled the program before its broadcast. More recently, WRAZ was among a handful of stations that either delayed or refused to air the series premiere of Osbournes: Reloaded on March 31, 2009. In the station's case, the show aired at 11:35 p.m., replacing an episode of Seinfeld that had been moved to the spot immediately after American Idol. Since WRAL operates in a duopoly with WRAZ, the station also broadcasts NBC (formerly CBS until February 29, 2016 when WRAL swapped affiliations with WNCN) programming in certain cases when WRAL is unable to do so (such as during special events, or extended breaking news or severe weather coverage). For example, WRAZ aired CBS Sports coverage of the Duke/St. Louis college basketball game on December 11, 2010 so WRAL could offer live coverage of <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards's</b> funeral.|$|R
50|$|Hail the Conquering Hero (1944) is a satirical comedy/drama {{written and}} {{directed}} by Preston Sturges, starring Eddie Bracken, Ella Raines and William Demarest, and featuring Raymond Walburn, Franklin Pangborn, <b>Elizabeth</b> Patterson, Bill <b>Edwards</b> and Freddie Steele.|$|R

2500|$|Non-coverage {{was also}} discussed. Some {{stated that the}} non-coverage was {{motivated}} by sympathy for <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards.</b> Several prominent sites criticized the omission {{of information about the}} allegations, most notably Gawker.com and Roger L. Simon of Pajamas Media, whose posts were linked by Glenn Reynolds at the high-traffic weblog, Instapundit. For instance, as of August 6, cable television news network, CNN, had not mentioned the story, and MSNBC had mentioned it once. Several pundits stated that Edwards was [...] "fair game" [...] for reporting on the allegations because he had been recently identified as a potential candidate for vice president or attorney general for Obama, and that Edwards himself had made his marital fidelity an issue in his campaign.|$|E
2500|$|CBS News journalist, Bob Schieffer, {{asked about}} the {{allegations}} on Imus in the Morning, stating, [...] "I believe that's a story {{that we will be}} avoiding, because it appears to me that there's absolutely nothing to it ... This seems to be just sort of a staple of modern campaigns, that you got through at least one love child, which turns out not to be a love child. And I think we can all do better than this one." [...] Mickey Kaus, a journalist at Slate, speculated that the lack of mainstream coverage was motivated by a desire not to harm <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards,</b> who was fighting cancer at the time. Kaus also considered the possibility of news organizations taking a [...] "wait-and-see" [...] attitude, pending the results of the Iowa caucuses.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the same}} day, <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards</b> {{released}} a statement that first appeared on the liberal blog, The Daily Kos. The statement said that, in 2006, [...] "John had made a terrible mistake," [...] though {{she went on to}} praise her husband for [...] "courage in the face of shame." [...] She also said that she hoped people would watch the interview that aired later that night on the ABC News late-night program, Nightline, in which her husband admitted the affair to Woodruff. She did, in her statement, criticize the claims that her husband fathered a child as an [...] "absurd lie in a tabloid publication." [...] Elizabeth Edwards' seemingly willing participation in the efforts to cover up the affair have also been called into question. [...] "I think she's complicit," [...] said Brad Crone, a Raleigh-based Democratic consultant. [...] "Obviously, she knew. While she's the victim, she clearly didn't {{stand in the way of}} the cover-up." ...|$|E
5000|$|The book is autobiographical {{in nature}} and relates the story of four civil trials where Edwards acted as an {{attorney}} for people seeking damages (petitioners) against large institutions and insurance companies (respondents). Interspersing the stories of each trial are remembrances from Edwards's childhood, time at the University of North Carolina School of Law, and meeting his wife, <b>Elizabeth</b> Anania <b>Edwards.</b> Edwards also wrote about his children (including Wade, his teenage son {{who died in a}} car accident).|$|R
50|$|John W.Lane {{was born}} in Kentucky to Thomas H. and <b>Elizabeth</b> B. (<b>Edwards)</b> Lane. The family moved to Texas in 1849, {{settling}} in Fannin County. John Lane moved to Dallas in 1857. There, he married Betty Crutchfield, daughter of Thomas F. and Frances M. Crutchfield on January 5, 1860. Crutchfield died in January 1866. Lane married a second time to L. Emma Thompson Hughes of San Marcos, Texas, on January 8, 1868. The two had one son, Clarence C. Lane.|$|R
50|$|She {{was born}} Elizabeth Jane Lloyd in 1889 in Llanilar, Ceredigion, {{the only child}} of timber {{merchant}} John Lloyd, and his wife <b>Elizabeth</b> (née <b>Edwards).</b> She was first educated at Aberystwyth County School and later went to Aberystwyth University where she graduated with first class honours in Welsh in 1911. She was awarded a Fellowship by the University and studied mostly in libraries situated in London and Oxford for a further three years. In London, she and her close friend, the composer Morfydd Llwyn Owen, were assisted by Liberal politician Herbert Lewis and his wife Ruth.|$|R
2500|$|On November 3, 2004, <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards</b> {{revealed}} {{that she had}} been diagnosed with breast cancer. She was treated via chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and continued to work within the Democratic Party and her husband's One America Committee. On March 22, 2007, during his campaign for the 2008 Democratic nomination for the presidency, Edwards and his wife announced that her cancer had returned; she was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer, with newly discovered metastases to the bone and possibly to her lung. They said that the cancer was [...] "no longer curable, but is completely treatable" [...] and that they planned to continue campaigning together with an occasional break when she requires treatment. In June 2010, Elizabeth published a book called Resilience. Her book is about the struggles of her marriage and how she was affected by her husband's affair. In the book, Elizabeth talks about how long she was in the dark about the affair and how many times her husband, John, lied about the details of the affair. She never addresses John's mistress by name but calls her a [...] "parasitic groupie" [...] and claims that she is pathetic. Elizabeth also opens up about how she tried to forgive her husband after she first learned of the affair but struggled to find forgiveness when he continued to lie.|$|E
5000|$|Client <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards</b> and her husband, Senator John Edwards {{commissioned}} Mihaly {{to carve}} the headstone of their deceased son, Wade, {{out of a}} 24,000 pound block of Vermont marble. <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards</b> was [...] "enchanted and confused" [...] by the [...] "weird and wonderful" [...] artist, yet felt the sculpture of an angel caressing her child was [...] "extraordinary". The 10 ft tall monument rests in Raleigh's Historic Oakwood Cemetery, the site of burial for governors, U.S. senators and 2,800 Confederate war veterans. Mihaly also designed the monument in Historic Oakwood Cemetery for <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Edwards</b> after her death in 2010 from breast cancer.|$|E
