40|$|An {{automatic}} and efficient method to determine appropriate hole cuts based on distances {{to the wall}} and <b>donor</b> stencil <b>maps</b> for overset grids is presented. A new robust procedure is developed to create a closed surface triangulation representation of each geometric component for accurate determination of the minimum hole. Hole boundaries are then displaced away from the tight grid-spacing regions near solid walls to allow grid overlap to occur away from the walls where cell sizes from neighboring grids are more comparable. The placement of hole boundaries is efficiently determined using a mid-distance rule and Cartesian maps of potential valid donor stencils with minimal user input. Application of this procedure typically results in a spatially-variable offset of the hole boundaries from the minimum hole with {{only a small number of}} orphan points remaining.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the sperm protein {{expression}} profile (proteome map) from a patient who experienced failed fertilization at IVF with fertile controls. One patient and three fertile donor sperm samples were characterized using two-dimensional electrophoresis. Differences in protein expression were established using gel analysis software before attempted protein identification. Gel analysis of the fertile <b>donor</b> proteome <b>maps</b> revealed excellent reproducibility as well as very low intra-donor and inter-donor variability in the presence of protein spots. In the patient samples, we have noted 20 consistent differences in protein expression (six spots missing, three additional spots, four less abundant, seven more abundant) compared with the controls. Two proteins that were more intense in the patient have been conclusively identified as secretory actin-binding protein and outer dense fibre protein 2 / 2. In conclusion proteome variation between different fertile donors was very low. In contrast, the patient proteome exhibited 20 differences compared with controls, which we believe is an underestimate. These proteins merit further investigation to determine whether failed fertilization at IVF might be caused by abnormalities in their expression. This case report represents a proof of principle that proteomics may be useful to study defects in sperm function...|$|R
40|$|The Energy Assistance Fund (EAF) is a voluntary, nonprofit fuel {{fund that}} {{provides}} grants to income qualified utility customers {{in an effort}} to help those customers avoid electricity service disconnection. The administering utility and the energy industry as a whole is undergoing transformative change, resulting in a projected decrease of fundraising capacity for EAF among its most substantial donor pool - utility shareholders and employees. Utility customers represent a small percentage of EAF donors, despite the significant size of the customer base. Through a series of ethnographic interviews and secondary research, this thesis seeks to understand the demographics and motivations of utility customers who donate to EAF in order to help improve EAF’s fundraising strategy and donor solicitations to eventually grow customer donations. The goal of EAF is to maintain or grow donations from 2014 levels so the Fund can continue to serve income qualified customers facing energy poverty. This thesis provides a contextual review of fuel funds; challenges faced by the energy and utility industry; the politics and culture of energy; as well as nonprofit sector fundraising challenges and cultures/motivations of giving.

40|$|Proteins encoded by DNA segment RD 1 of Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} {{have recently}} been demonstrated to play important roles in bacterial virulence, vaccine development, and diagnostic reagent design. Previously, we characterized two immunodominant T-cell antigens, the early secreted antigen target (ESAT- 6) and the 10 -kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP 10), which are encoded by the esx-lhp operon in this region. In the present study we characterized a third putative open reading frame in this region, rv 3873, which encodes a PPE protein. We found that the rv 3873 gene is expressed in M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv and that the native protein, Rv 3873, is predominantly associated with the mycobacterial cell or wall. When tested as a His-tagged recombinant protein, Rv 3873 stimulated high levels of gamma interferon secretion in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} isolated from tuberculosis (TB) patients, as well as from healthy tuberculin purified protein derivative-positive donors. In contrast to other RD 1 -encoded antigens, Rv 3873 was also found to be recognized by a significant proportion of Mycobacterium bovis BCG-vaccinated <b>donors.</b> Epitope <b>mapping</b> performed with overlapping peptides revealed a broad pattern of T-cell recognition comprising both TB-specific epitopes and epitopes also recognized by BCG-vaccinated donors.

40|$|Motivation: Seed {{filtering}} {{is critical}} in DNA read mapping, a process where billions of DNA fragments (reads) sampled from a <b>donor</b> are <b>mapped</b> onto a reference genome to identify genomic variants of the donor. Read mappers 1) quickly generate possible mapping locations (i. e., seeds) for each read, 2) extract reference sequences {{at each of the}} mapping locations, and then 3) check similarity between each read and its associated reference sequences with a computationally expensive dynamic programming algorithm (alignment) to determine the origin of the read. Location filters come into play before alignment, discarding seed locations that alignment would have deemed a poor match. The ideal location filter would discard all poor matching locations prior to alignment such that there is no wasted computation on poor alignments. Results: We propose a novel filtering algorithm, GRIM-Filter, optimized to exploit emerging 3 D-stacked memory systems that integrate computation within a stacked logic layer, enabling processing-in-memory (PIM). GRIM-Filter quickly filters locations by 1) introducing a new representation of coarse-grained segments of the reference genome and 2) using massively-parallel in-memory operations to identify read presence within each coarse-grained segment. Our evaluations show that for 5 % error acceptance rates, GRIM-Filter eliminates 5. 59 x- 6. 41 x more false negatives and exhibits end-to-end speedups of 1. 81 x- 3. 65 x compared to mappers employing the best previous filtering algorithm...|$|R

It is shown here that they carry one or more ilv genes and a variable portion of the adjacent proximal ilv gene. This observation was used to develop a method, analogous to deletion mapping, for ordering mutant sites within the ilv genes. This method requires the use of a series of merogenotes each carrying an increasingly longer segment of the gene being mapped. A simplified method of fine-structure mapping is also described which requires only one or two F′ <b>donor</b> strains to <b>map</b> any one gene. This method is based on the large differences observed in recombination frequencies for mutant sites at various distances from the origin of the incomplete merogenote gene.

40|$|Cytotoxic T {{lymphocytes}} (CTL) recognizing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigens (EBNA) are {{an important}} host defence mechanism in restricting the proliferation of EBV-infected B cells. Previously, B-type lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) infected with vaccinia recombinants encoding for the EBNA proteins {{have been used to}} identify A-type-specific CTL epitopes. However, to localize the CTL epitopes encoded by both A- and B-type transformants, B-type LCL are an inappropriate host for vaccinia. In the present study, an alternative host cell for vaccinia infection is described. Initial studies demonstrated that anti-IgM (mu-chain specific) -stimulated human B cells allowed vaccinia virus to replicate more efficiently than either phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes (PHA blasts) or CTL and expressed EBNA proteins following recombinant vaccinia infection. Furthermore, the presentation and recognition of target epitopes expressed on vaccinia-infected anti-mu-stimulated B cell blasts were comparable to that on similarly infected LCL. Anti-mu-stimulated B cells were used to define the CTL epitopes recognized by a panel of CTL clones from an EBV-immune donor. Using recombinant vaccinia-infected anti-mu-stimulated B cells, the CTL response from this <b>donor</b> was <b>mapped</b> to the EBNA 6 protein. Most importantly, in vitro stimulation of unfractionated mononuclear cells with vaccinia-infected anti-mu B cells activated a memory CTL response. Based on the vaccinia results, screening of peptides from EBNA 6 localized the epitope {{for the majority of the}} EBNA 6 -specific CTL clones to the sequence EENLLDFVRFM, apparently in association with HLA-B 44. This work clearly demonstrates that anti-mu-stimulated B cells not only provide an efficient model for localizing the CTL epitope(s) but also raises the possibility of reactivating a memory T-cell response to any gene product expressed by recombinant vaccinia...|$|R
40|$|Cancer cells {{frequently}} exhibit {{defects in}} apoptosis, contributing to increased survival {{and resistance to}} chemotherapy. This can result from decreased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax, through abnormal proteasomal degradation. The central hypothesis of this project is that this abnormal proteasomal degradation in cancer cells {{will result in the}} generation of peptides that bind to MHC class I molecules, and displayed at the cell surface for CD 8 + T cell recognition. If this is correct, then T cells directed against Bax peptides should be able to recognize and kill human cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, candidate HLA-A 2 binding peptide epitopes were identified from Bax and T cell immunogenicity tested using IFNy ELISpot assays. Positive T cell responses were detected against Bax peptides in 10 / 16 healthy donors. The specificity of a CD 8 + T cell clone (KSIVB 17) derived from one <b>donor,</b> was <b>mapped</b> to two similar peptide epitopes, Baxi 36 - 144 (IMGWTLDFL) and Bax 135144 (TIMGWTLDFL). In addition to recognition of peptide pulsed target cells, this clone was also able to recognise primary tumour cells from CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) patients, and kill cervical carcinoma and osteosarcoma cell lines. T cell reactivity correlated with abnormal proteasomal degradation of Bax in cancer cells. Attempts to generate Bax-specific T cells in CLL patients demonstrated that naive and memory T cell responses were compromised compared to healthy donors. This compromised T cell immunity appeared to result from increased expression of immunosuppressive molecules, increased frequency of Treg cells and a skewed memory T cell phenotype in CLL patients. Overall, this research supports the novel concept that proteins such as Bax, which are abnormally degraded in cancer cells, can be targets for CD 8 + T cells. However use of Bax in immunotherapy will require strategies to overcome suppression of T cell responses in CLL and other cancers...|$|R

MAP was measured before and after intravenous in bolus injection of the compound in conscious 2 K- 1 C and normotensive (2 K) rats. In the hypertensive rats (basal 196. 70 +/- 8. 70 mmHg, n= 5), the MAP was reduced in - 34. 25 +/- 13. 50 mmHg(P 0. 05) on MAP of normotensive and moderate hypertensive rats. However, in the severe hypertensive rats (basal 202. 46 +/- 16. 70 mmHg, n = 6) there was a significant reduction on the MAP of - 28. 64 +/- 12. 45 mmHg.

40|$|Abstract With the {{remarkable}} development in inexpensive sequencing technologies and supporting computational tools, {{we have the}} promise of medicine being personalized by knowledge of the individual genome. Current technologies provide high throughput, but short reads. Reconstruction of the donor genome is based either on de novo assembly of the (short) reads, or on <b>mapping</b> <b>donor</b> reads to a standard reference. While such techniques demonstrate high success rates for inferring 'simple' genomic segments, they are confounded by segments with complex duplication patterns, including regions of direct medical relevance, like the HLA and the KIR regions. In this work, we address this problem with a method for assessing {{the quality of a}} predicted genome sequence for complex regions of the genome. This method combines two natural types of evidence: sequence similarity of the mapped reads to the predicted donor genome, and distribution of reads across the predicted genome. We define a new scoring function for read-to-genome matchings, which penalizes for sequence dissimilarities and deviations from expected read location distribution, and present an efficient algorithm for finding matchings that minimize the penalty. The algorithm is based on a formal problem, first defined in this paper, called Coverage Sensitive many-to-many min-cost bipartite Matching (CSM). This new problem variant generalizes the standard (one-to-one) weighted bipartite matching problem, and can be solved using network flows. The resulting Java-based tool, called SAGE (Scoring function for Assembled GEnomes), is freely available upon request. We demonstrate over simulated data that SAGE can be used to infer correct haplotypes of the highly repetitive KIR region on the Human chromosome 19...|$|R

Examination of four cointegrates indicated that pGK 12 and pSA 3 had inserted within two locations on pTR 2030. Resolution of the cointegrates generated vector derivatives containing a 0. 8 -kb insert of pTR 2030 DNA. Restriction analyses of several resolution plasmids indicated that the 0. 8 -kb element had inserted into various positions within pGK 12 and pSA 3 and in certain cases had inactivated the Cmr or Emr marker of pGK 12.

Wheat (Triticum aestivum, genome AABBDD) seedlings exhibit a low early growth rate or early vigor. The germplasm of wheat is limited. Wild relatives constitute a source of genetic variation. We explored the physiological and genetic relationships among a range of early vigor traits in Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome <b>donor.</b> A genetic <b>map</b> was constructed with amplified fragment-length polymorphism and simple sequence repeat markers, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis was performed on the F 4 population of recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between contrasting accessions. The genetic map consisted of 10 linkage groups, which were assigned to the seven chromosomes and covered 68 % of the D genome. QTL analysis revealed 87 mapped QTLs (log of the odds > 2. 65) in clusters, 3. 1 QTLs per trait, explaining 32 % of the phenotypic variance. Chromosomes 1 D, 4 D, and 7 D harbored QTLs for relative growth rate, biomass allocation, specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, and unit leaf rate. Chromosome 2 D covered QTLs for rate and duration of leaf elongation, cell production rate, and cell length. Chromosome 5 D harbored QTLs for the total leaf mass and area and growth rate of the number of leaves and tillers.

The target antigens against which such CTL responses are directed are yet undefined, but the antigens probably derived from {{one or more of}} the EBV "latent" proteins constitutively expressed in virus-transformed B cells. We have analyzed target specificity of CTL responses from two EBV-immune donors that are preferentially reactive against autologous cells transformed with type A but not with type B virus isolates. Coding sequences for four EBV latent proteins with allelic polymorphism between A and B virus types [...] namely, the EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) EBNA 2, EBNA 3 a, EBNA 3 c, and EBNA leader protein [...] have been introduced into vaccinia virus vectors under control of vaccinia promoter P 7. 5 and used to express relevant EBNA proteins in appropriate target cells. Thus the CTL response from one <b>donor</b> has been <b>mapped</b> to type A EBNA 2 protein and from a second donor to type A EBNA 3 a protein. Thereafter, a series of recombinant vaccinia viruses were constructed that carried specific internal deletions within the EBNA 2 type A coding sequence; by using these vectors, the above EBNA 2 type A-specific CTL response was shown to be directed against an epitope within a 100 -amino acid fragment near the N terminus of the protein. This work clearly shows human CTL recognition of virus-coded nuclear antigens in the EBV system; moreover, it establishes an experimental approach that can be extended to all EBV latent proteins and to the more common CTL responses that cross-react against type A and type B virus isolates...|$|R

Thus, intravenous injection of a short-acting NO <b>donor,</b> DEANNO, decreases <b>MAP</b> and heart rate, leading to subsequent decreases in tumour blood flow and oxygenation...|$|R
40|$|Adenosines {{are present}} at a disproportionately high {{frequency}} within several RNA structural motifs. To explore {{the importance of}} individual adenosine functional groups for group I intron activity, we performed Nucleotide Analog Interference Mapping (NAIM) {{with a collection of}} adenosine analogues. This paper reports the synthesis, transcriptional incorporation, and the observed interference pattern throughout the Tetrahymena group I intron for eight adenosine derivatives tagged with an alpha-phosphorothioate linkage for use in NAIM. All of the analogues were accurately incorporated into the transcript as an A. The sites that interfere with the 3 '-exon ligation reaction of the Tetrahymena intron are coincident with the sites of phylogenetic conservation, yet the interference patterns for each analogue are different. These interference data provide several biochemical constraints that improve our understanding of the Tetrahymena ribozyme structure. For example, the data support an essential A-platform within the J 6 / 6 a region, major groove packing of the P 3 and P 7 helices, minor groove packing of the P 3 and J 4 / 5 helices, and an axial model for binding of the guanosine cofactor. The data also identify several essential functional groups within a highly conserved single-stranded region in the core of the intron (J 8 / 7). At four sites in the intron, interference was observed with 2 '-fluoro A, but not with 2 '-deoxy A. Based upon comparison with the P 4 -P 6 crystal structure, this may provide a biochemical signature for nucleotide positions where the ribose sugar adopts an essential C 2 '-endo conformation. In other cases where there is interference with 2 '-deoxy A, {{the presence or absence of}} 2 '-fluoro A interference helps to establish whether the 2 '-OH acts as a hydrogen bond <b>donor</b> or acceptor. <b>Mapping</b> of the Tetrahymena intron establishes a basis set of information that will allow these reagents to be used with confidence in systems that are less well understood...|$|R
40|$|This brief report {{summarizes}} the initial key {{findings of a}} recently launched China Philanthropy Project at Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation. In the summer of 2015, our team began collecting data relating to major domestic philanthropic donations in China from September 2014 to August 2015. We sought to identify the 100 top donors in China, their professional background (real estate, manufacturing, etc.), type of giving (cash, stock, etc.), cause(s) supported (education, environment, etc.), vehicle of support (direct donation, donation through another foundation, etc.), origin and destination of giving, and type of recipient organization to which they gave. These 100 individuals accounted for $ 3. 8 billion of both pledges and donations in the one-year period, which accounted for about 0. 03 % of China's 2014 GDP, and their actual giving equaled just under one-quarter of total national giving that year. In the event that top donations were given by a private company, the founder of that corporation is listed as the donor, given the level of control such founders exercise over private companies in China. In the event that top donations were given by a publicly listed company or corporate foundation, whose ownership structure can therefore be confirmed, the controlling shareholder is listed as the donor. While Forbes, Hurun, and other organizations have compiled data related to China's "rich lists," and academic institutions such as Johns Hopkins have built useful comparative indices related to giving and volunteering, we thought an interactive research platform was needed to think about definitions of generosity and the geography of giving in the Chinese context. The resulting <b>maps,</b> <b>donor</b> database, "Top 10 " lists, and key findings serve {{as the beginning of}} such a user-focused platform. The website also features social media and feedback/inquiry e-mail buttons for visitors to share thoughts on how to improve and expand the site, identify errors, and share the findings. Our early work has identified several broad patterns, and therefore a host of new questions that will frame subsequent waves of more in-depth research in the coming years...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background HIV- 1 {{integrase}} (IN) is {{an emerging}} drug target, as IN strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are proving potent antiretroviral agents in clinical trials. One credible theory sees INSTIs as docking at the cellular (acceptor) DNA-binding site after IN forms a transitional complex with viral (<b>donor)</b> DNA. However, <b>mapping</b> of the DNA and INSTI binding sites within the IN catalytic core domain (CCD) has been uncertain. Methods Structural superimpositions were conducted using the SWISS PDB and Cn 3 D free software. Docking simulations of INSTIs were {{run by a}} widely validated genetic algorithm (GOLD). Results Structural superimpositions suggested that a two-metal model for HIV- 1 IN CCD in complex with small molecule, 1 -(5 -chloroindol- 3 -yl) - 3 -(tetrazoyl) - 1, 3 -propandione-ene (5 CITEP) {{could be used as}} a surrogate for an IN/viral DNA complex, because it allowed replication of contacts documented biochemically in viral DNA/IN complexes or displayed by a crystal structure of the IN-related enzyme Tn 5 transposase in complex with transposable DNA. Docking simulations showed that the fitness of different compounds for the catalytic cavity of the IN/ 5 CITEP complex significantly (P 50 s) in strand transfer assays in vitro. The amino acids involved in inhibitor binding matched those involved in drug resistance. Both metal binding and occupation of the putative viral DNA binding site by 5 CITEP appeared to be important for optimal drug/ligand interactions. The docking site of INSTIs appeared to overlap with a putative acceptor DNA binding region adjacent to but distinct from the putative donor DNA binding site, and homologous to the nucleic acid binding site of RNAse H. Of note, some INSTIs such as 4, 5 -dihydroxypyrimidine carboxamides/ N -Alkyl- 5 -hydroxypyrimidinone carboxamides, a highly promising drug class including raltegravir/MK- 0518 (now in clinical trials), displayed interactions with IN reminiscent of those displayed by fungal molecules from Fusarium sp., shown in the 1990 s to inhibit HIV- 1 integration. Conclusion The 3 D model presented here supports the idea that INSTIs dock at the putative acceptor DNA-binding site in a IN/viral DNA complex. This mechanism of enzyme inhibition, likely to be exploited by some natural products, might disclose future strategies for inhibition of nucleic acid-manipulating enzymes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Across Europe, {{transplant}} centers vary {{in the set}} {{of psychosocial}} screening criteria/guidelines used for the selection of eligible living donors. Our aim was to explore whether a common framework underlies this variation in screening criteria and, based on this framework, to develop a consensus on the essential elements of psychosocial screening of living liver and kidney donors. In order to do so, a research question was set out to define a conceptual framework of the concept ‘Psychosocial’ {{in the context of}} screening living organ donors in Europe. We formulated the following research question: Which psychosocial screening criteria are most commonly reported and considered as most important or effective in selecting eligible kidney and liver <b>donors?</b> Method: Concept <b>mapping</b> methodology was used to create a visual representation of the complex topic ‘Psychosocial’ in the context of screening living organ donors in Europe, in which underlying concepts, the relative importance of these concepts and the interplay between different concepts are organized. Initial psychosocial screening criteria (N= 83) were derived from an extensive systematic literature review on guidelines, protocols and consensus statements on psychosocial screening practices, complemented by group brainstorm sessions. These criteria were then sorted and rated for their importance and effectiveness by 26 project participants. The data were analyzed using the Concept System Core© Software, which provided us with graphical depictions (concept maps) illustrating the view of project participants on these screening criteria. Pattern Matches and Go-Zones showed us the highlycommon, important and effective criteria. Results: The concept map procedure resulted in six clusters of psychosocial screening criteria: (1) Motivation and decision making (2) Personal resources (3) Psychopathology (4) Social resources (5) Ethical and Legal factors (6) Information and risk processing. Bivariate rating of these criteria revealed which important criteria are already frequently used for screening and which require more attention. Based on the cluster map and bivariate ratings we constructed a conceptual framework for non-medical risk factors that need to be considered when screening potential living organ donors. Conclusion: We provided a conceptual framework of psychosocial screening criteria which can serve as a practical recommendation for the psychosocial screening of potential living organ donors...|$|R
40|$|Hernández, Pilar et al. Wheat is {{the third}} most {{important}} crop for human nutrition in the world. The availability of high-resolution genetic and physical maps and ultimately a complete genome sequence holds great promise for breeding improved varieties to cope with increasing food demand under the conditions of changing global climate. However, the large size of the bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome (approximately 17 Gb/ 1 C) and the triplication of genic sequence resulting from its hexaploid status have impeded genome sequencing of this important crop species. Here we describe the use of mitotic chromosome flow sorting to separately purify and then shotgun-sequence a pair of telocentric chromosomes that together form chromosome 4 A (856 Mb/ 1 C) of wheat. The isolation of this much reduced template and the consequent avoidance {{of the problem of}} sequence duplication, in conjunction with synteny-based comparisons with other grass genomes, have facilitated construction of an ordered gene map of chromosome 4 A, embracing â‰¥ 85 % of its total gene content, and have enabled precise localization of the various translocation and inversion breakpoints on chromosome 4 A that differentiate it from its progenitor chromosome in the A genome diploid <b>donor.</b> The gene <b>map</b> of chromosome 4 A, together with the emerging sequences of homoeologous wheat chromosome groups 4, 5 and 7, represent unique resources {{that will allow us to}} obtain new insights into the evolutionary dynamics between homoeologous chromosomes and syntenic chromosomal regions. © 2011 The Authors.
