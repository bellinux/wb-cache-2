5|$|In May 2013 the {{investigation}} board was {{made aware of}} that two passengers had each their Mobira NMT-450 mobile telephone {{with them on the}} flights. As this had not been mentioned in the original report, AIBN conducted a review of the issue and especially if the telephones could have influenced the vertical navigation. They concluded in December that this was not the case, as there were no indications of interferences and that there are no instances where <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> has been a contributing cause to an aviation accident.|$|E
5|$|The southeastern corner {{contains}} the ABC 50kW radio tower which transmits ABC AM radio in Perth, including ABC Local Radio (6WF), Radio National and ABC NewsRadio. Several other towers, including a 20kW and 10kW tower, {{are also at}} the site. Some residents argue that <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> from the towers is adversely affecting their television and telephone reception, with the issue taken up in Federal parliament by local MPs. An inquiry was held by ACMA in November 2010 into the situation, which found that apart from some disturbance to ABC2 signals, TV and radio signals in the area were of acceptable strength and quality.|$|E
5|$|In all USB connectors, the {{construction}} always {{ensures that the}} external sheath on the plug makes contact with its counterpart in the receptacle before {{any of the four}} connectors within make electrical contact. The external metallic sheath is typically connected to system ground, thus dissipating damaging static charges. This enclosure design also provides a degree of protection from <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> to the USB signal while it travels through the mated connector pair (the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair travels in parallel). In addition, because of the required sizes of the power and common connections, they are made after the system ground but before the data connections. This type of staged make-break timing allows for electrically safe hot-swapping.|$|E
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} to <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interferences</b> of the analog circuits {{used in the}} sensor readout front-end is discussed. Analog circuits still play indeed {{a crucial role in}} sensor signal acquisition due to the analog nature of sensory signals. The effect of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interferences</b> has been simulated and measured in many commercial and integrated analog circuits; the main cause of the electromagnetic susceptibility is investigated and the guidelines to design high EMI immunity circuits are provided...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Analog {{circuits}} such as linear {{voltage regulators}} {{are very sensitive}} to <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interferences</b> which induce voltage offset on their outputs. In harsh environments, the aging of this component can be accelerated and could lead to an increase of the effect of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interferences.</b> This paper proposes an original study about the drift of the susceptibility level of a low dropout voltage regulator submitted to electrical stresses. Some analyses based on CAD simulations are proposed to explain the experimental observations...|$|R

5|$|While {{looking for}} the Marines near Aether, Samus's ship is damaged by severe {{lightning}} storms from the planet. Said storms have caused <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> that prevented the Marines from communicating with the Federation. Samus finds the troops dead and surrounded by hive creatures called Splinters. Deceased Marines suddenly rise and attack her, apparently possessed, and she fights them off. Samus then encounters her evil doppelgänger, Dark Samus, for the first time, and Dark Samus jumps through a portal. Samus decides to follow her through it and into Dark Aether, a vile trans-dimensional duplicate of Aether, where Samus is attacked {{by a group of}} dark creatures called Ing, who steal the weapons from Samus's suit before pushing her back through the portal.|$|E
5|$|KAL007's {{divergence}} {{prevented the}} aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter range {{very high frequency}} radio (VHF). It therefore requested KAL015, also en route to Seoul, to relay reports to air traffic control on its behalf. KAL007 requested KAL015 to relay its position three times. At 14:43UTC, KAL007 directly transmitted a change of {{estimated time of arrival}} for its next waypoint, NEEVA, to the international flight service station at Anchorage, but it did so over the longer range high frequency radio (HF) rather than VHF. HF transmissions are able to carry a longer distance than VHF, but are vulnerable to <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> and static; VHF is clearer with less interference, and preferred by flight crews. The inability to establish direct radio communications to be able to transmit their position directly did not alert the pilots of KAL007 of their ever-increasing divergence and was not considered unusual by air traffic controllers. Halfway between Bethel and waypoint NABIE, KAL007 passed through the southern portion of the North American Aerospace Defense Command buffer zone. This zone is north of Romeo 20 and off-limits to civilian aircraft.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, Ricardo Marini and Eugenio Galian of the IUA (same Argentine {{institute}} as Hector Brito's) replicated previous experiments, {{but their}} results were negative and the measured effects declared as originating from spurious <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interferences</b> only.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Degradation {{mechanisms}} {{accelerated by}} harsh conditions (high temperature, electrical stress) can affect circuit performances. Submitted to <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interferences,</b> aged components can become more susceptible, which stirs up {{questions about the}} safety level of the final application. Unfortunately, the impact of circuit aging on its susceptibility level remains under evaluated and is not taken into account at circuit design level. This paper presents a first attempt of a modeling methodology aiming at predicting the impact of circuit aging on the susceptibility to <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interferences.</b> This methodology is applied to model and explain the measured variations of the susceptibility level of phase-locked loop after an accelerated-life test...|$|R

25|$|Twisted {{pair cables}} are often {{shielded}} {{in an attempt}} to prevent <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference.</b> Shielding provides an electrically conductive barrier to attenuate electromagnetic waves external to the shield, and provides a conduction path by which induced currents can be circulated and returned to the source, via ground reference connection.|$|E

25|$|Immunity to {{electromagnetic}} interference: Light transmission through {{optical fibers}} is unaffected by other electromagnetic radiation nearby.

25|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of the two-level converter is that, {{in order to}} achieve the very high operating voltages required for an HVDC scheme, several hundred IGBTs have to be connected in series and switched simultaneously in each valve. This requires specialised types of IGBT with sophisticated gate drive circuits, and can lead to very high levels of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference.</b>|$|E

25|$|Deformation: twisted pair's {{susceptibility}} to <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> greatly {{depends on the}} pair twisting schemes (sometimes patented by the manufacturers) staying intact during the installation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the successful {{design of a}} CMOS operational amplifier with enhanced immunity to <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interferences.</b> Thanks to its strongly symmetrical topology, the amplifier exhibits an intrinsic robustness to interferences arising from a wide class of sources. Such a scheme, {{for the first time}} in the authors' knowledge, proves the effectiveness of symmetrical topologies to minimize the effects of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interferences</b> in operational amplifiers. The amplifier architecture is based on 2 identical stages: 2 fully differential source cross-coupled amplifiers with active loads. The circuit was fabricated in a 0. 8 mum n-well CMOS technology (AMS CYE process). Experimental results, in terms of EMI immunity, are presented and compared with a commercial amplifier. They show a low susceptibility to EMI conveyed both to the input and the power pins. The EMI effects on the proposed amplifier are reduced by more than one order of magnitude, compared to a commercial amplifier. Furthermore the amplifier overall measured performances are provided along with the corresponding simulation results...|$|R
