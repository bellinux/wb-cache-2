If {{there is sufficient}} thiamine present in the cell then the thiamine binds to the mRNAs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>enzymes</b> that are required in the pathway and prevents their translation.

25|$|Since the 1960s most endocrinologists have {{referred}} to the forms of CAH by the traditional names in the left column, which generally correspond to the deficient enzyme activity. As exact structures and genes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>enzymes</b> were identified in the 1980s, most of the enzymes {{were found to be}} cytochrome P450 oxidases and were renamed to reflect this. In some cases, more than one enzyme was found to participate in a reaction, and in other cases a single enzyme mediated in more than one reaction. There was also variation in different tissues and mammalian species.|$|E

A series of {{ascorbate}} derivatives {{has been used to}} examine the specificity and the chemistry of the reduction site of dopamine beta-monooxygenase (D beta M). Replacement of the 6 -OH group of ascorbic acid with either bromine or hydrogen does not alter <b>the</b> <b>enzyme</b> reduction efficiency significantly. Unexpectedly, the 6 -OH modified ascorbate derivatives, 6 -S-phenyl- 6 -thio-L-ascorbic acid and 6 -O-phenyl-L-ascorbic acid were found to have much higher affinity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>enzyme</b> than <b>the</b> most effective known electron donor, ascorbic acid (AscH-). The affinity of 2 -amino- 6 -S-phenyl-L-ascorbic acid was found to be similar to that of 2 -amino-L-ascorbic acid. 6 -Amino- 6 -deoxy-L-ascorbic acid is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>enzyme.</b> Although glucoascorbic acid is an excellent substrate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>enzyme,</b> imino glucoascorbic acid was found to be an extremely potent competitive inhibitor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>enzyme.</b> <b>The</b> stereoelectronic properties and alternate binding modes of these molecules have been considered in explaining the observations.

2500|$|Physiologically, teeth {{provide for}} greater chewing ability. [...] They {{allow us to}} {{masticate}} food thoroughly, increasing the surface area necessary to allow <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>enzymes</b> present in the saliva, {{as well as in}} the stomach and intestines, to digest our food. [...] Chewing also allows food to be prepared into small boli that are more readily swallowed than haphazard chunks of considerable size. [...] For those who are even partially endentulous, it may become extremely difficult to chew food efficiently enough to swallow comfortably, although this is entirely dependent upon which teeth are lost. [...] When an individual loses enough posterior teeth to make it difficult to chew, he or she may need to cut their food into very small pieces and learn how to make use of their anterior teeth to chew. [...] If enough posterior teeth are missing, this will not only affect their chewing abilities, but also their occlusion; posterior teeth, in a mutually protected occlusion, help to protect the anterior teeth and the vertical dimension of occlusion and, when missing, the anterior teeth begin to bear a greater amount of force for which they are structurally prepared. [...] Thus, loss of posterior teeth will cause the anterior teeth to splay. [...] This can be prevented by obtaining dental prostheses, such as removable partial dentures, bridges or implant-supported crowns. [...] In addition to reestablishing a protected occlusion, these prostheses can greatly improve one's chewing abilities.|$|E
