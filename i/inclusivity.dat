5|$|A new Strategic Plan {{entitled}} Scouting for All {{was launched}} in 2014 to outline the association's focus between 2014–2018. It proposed four key areas of activity: Growth, <b>Inclusivity,</b> Youth-Shaped Scouting and Community Impact.|$|E
5|$|Stereotypical and {{historically}} inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views {{of indigenous peoples}} and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they {{contribute to the development}} of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting <b>inclusivity</b> and diversity.|$|E
25|$|Independent Warndarang pronouns are {{distinguished}} by person (first, second, and third), number (singular, dual, and plural), gender (masculine versus feminine in the third-person singular) and <b>inclusivity</b> (dual/plural first person including the addressee or dual/plural first person excluding the addressee). Nonhuman pronouns also mark noun class. Possessive pronouns mark for person, number, and <b>inclusivity,</b> {{but not for}} gender or for non-human noun class.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Rugby Football League {{were awarded}} the Stonewall Sport Award in {{recognition}} of their work in embracing <b>inclusivity</b> and tackling homophobia. They also became the first UK sporting organisation to make the top 100 employers in the Stonewall Index that measures attitudes towards lesbian, gay and bisexual staff.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, the Human Rights Campaign, a LGBT rights {{advocacy}} group, included Ocean Grove in its Municipal Equality Index, a {{study that}} scores 291 American cities based on their <b>inclusivity</b> of LGBT people. Ocean Grove scored 77 out of 100, representing the second highest score for cities located in New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} {{small group of}} congregations split away in 1987 to form the Alliance of Baptists. With more than 2,000 individual members in 2010, 32 domestic and international mission partners, and 130 affiliate congregations the Alliance is an organization of Baptists promoting what they call progressive theologies, radical <b>inclusivity,</b> justice-seeking, ecumenism, and mission partnerships around the world.|$|E
25|$|Borisov denied these {{accusations and}} in turn accused the Bulgarian Socialist Party of {{attempting}} to discredit him. Borisov stated {{in a meeting with}} NGOs on 5 March 2009 that he intends to include representatives of the Roma ethnicity in all levels of government, including a potential minister, and has reached out to offer <b>inclusivity</b> to Bulgaria's ethnic Turkish population; although these measures and proposals have been seen as politically empty.|$|E
25|$|Evening cricket is {{the least}} formal format of club cricket, and the route by which many new players are {{introduced}} to the game. It tends to follow the 20-20 version of the game, with additional time saving measures such as using 15 8-ball overs and not rebowling wides or no-balls (which then count as 2 runs each rather than the standard 1). This version of the game also puts an emphasis on <b>inclusivity,</b> with rules such as each bowler being limited to 2 overs each, and batsmen retiring after reaching 25 runs being used to ensure that every player has a part {{to play in the}} outcome of the game.|$|E
25|$|Peace First, a {{non-profit}} organisation {{based in the}} United States, has a programme in which youth volunteers work with children to design and implement community projects in a participatory way. The rationale is that children are natural creative thinkers and problem solvers. The programme focuses on developing social and emotional skills of self- awareness, empathy, <b>inclusivity</b> and relationships. It has also been implemented in rural areas of Colombia through a partnership between local governments and Colombian NGOs. Peace First has additionally developed a curriculum {{that can be used}} in schools. It addresses themes such as friendship, fairness, cooperation, con ict resolution and consequences of actions through experiential activities and cooperative games. For example, 1st graders learn about communicating their feelings, 3rd graders develop skills and awareness around communication and cooperation, 4th graders practice courage and taking a stand and 5th graders explore how to resolve and de-escalate conflicts.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} and well-known pro-UN organizations, UNA-USA has been {{on both sides of the}} issue. In 2003, UNA-USA's executive director of policy studies, Jeffrey Laurenti, wrote an article, An Idea Whose Time Has Not Come, arguing that there were important unresolved issues of <b>inclusivity,</b> authority, and efficiency with the UNPA. UNA's position seemed to reverse in November 2006, when the 38th plenary session of the World Federation of United Nations Associations issued a resolution stating that it [...] "Supports the establishment of a United Nations parliamentary Assembly as a consultative body within the United Nations system as a voice of the citizens; Calls upon the governments of the United Nations member states, parliamentarians and civil society representatives to jointly examine possible steps and options to create a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly." ...|$|E

Although its wide physical release was scheduled for July 17, Universal encouraged physical retailers to start selling it immediately after they receive shipments of the album. Retail company Target did not approve of its early release to iTunes and chose not to stock the album. Ocean's manager Christian Clancy responded in a message on Twitter that he found it [...] "interesting" [...] that Target [...] "also donates to non-equal rights organizations", suggesting their decision was influenced by Ocean's coming out. Target representatives dismissed Clancy's claims as [...] "absolutely false" [...] in a subsequent statement to MTV News, saying that the company [...] "supports <b>inclusivity</b> and diversity {{in every aspect of}} our business. Our assortment decisions are based on a number of factors, including guest demand." ...|$|E
500|$|Jaevion Nelson, an HIV/AIDS campaigner {{and human}} rights advocate, also {{published}} {{an article on the}} subject in The Gleaner. He noted that his initial reaction was to question why Jones had gone to the dance party and why he was not satisfied in attending Jamaica's underground gay parties. He added that he had subsequently realised that adopting this viewpoint was rooted in [...] "the culture of violence" [...] by which a victim is blamed for what happened to them. He called on Jamaicans to be tolerant of LGBT individuals, and to focus on [...] "rebuilding this great nation on the principles of <b>inclusivity,</b> love, equality and respect with no distinctions whatsoever". Also in The Gleaner, Sheila Veléz Martínez, {{a law professor at the}} University of Pittsburgh, condemned the murder as [...] "alarming evidence" [...] of the high rates of homophobia in Jamaican society.|$|E
500|$|Mainstream comics have {{historically}} excluded gay characters, with superhero comics {{in particular and}} the publishing houses Marvel and DC, the two largest publishers in the genre, and were criticized for their lack of <b>inclusivity.</b> Transgender characters have likewise been under-represented, although the common storyline of a superhero having their sex changed by magical or technological means has been regarded as an oblique reference to transgender and transsexual issues. British comics author Neil Gaiman {{has said that he}} included transgender characters in his works, such as Sandman, in response to the lack of realistic representation of such people in comics. Queer theory analyses have noted that LGBT characters in mainstream comic books are often shown as assimilated into heterosexual society, whereas in alternative comics the diversity and uniqueness of LGBT culture is at the forefront. Mainstream comics have also been labelled as [...] "heteronormative", in comparison to [...] "integrationist" [...] alternative comics.|$|E

500|$|Epsilon Kappa Theta ("EKT," [...] "Theta") at Dartmouth College {{was founded}} in January 1982 as the Epsilon Kappa colony of the Kappa Alpha Theta {{national}} sorority. [...] Epsilon Kappa was the 100th colony of the sorority. [...] The sorority initially met {{in a wide variety}} of locations, including the basement of the college president's house. [...] In 1984, the sorority moved into Brewster Hall, a College-owned house that had previously been used as an International House and later as temporary housing for the Alpha Chi Omega sorority. [...] In 1992, the sisters of the Epsilon Kappa chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta found the strict national rules and the primarily Christian religious readings and rituals of the organization to be antithetical to the spirit of feminism and <b>inclusivity</b> that the chapter desired. [...] The national organization was unhappy with the colony's decision to disobey their rules and their failure to follow the sorority's rituals. [...] On May 4, 1992, the Dartmouth chapter notified the Kappa Alpha Theta national organization of its unanimous vote to disaffiliate and become a local sorority. [...] The national organization revoked the charter of Epsilon Kappa. The Dartmouth women chose the new name Epsilon Kappa Theta. [...] The current Epsilon Kappa Theta residence is a Victorian house over 100 years old.|$|E

The sport as also been illustrated to yield a positive experience for athletes of all genders, increased desires for <b>inclusivity</b> and stereotype reduction. Testimonials include: [...] "The gender rule makes playing safe for me. I'm trans and genderqueer, two reasons I never know which team to join... so having a non-binary option means I don't have to choose." ...|$|E

2500|$|The role of non-Jews in Reconstructionist congregations is {{a matter}} of ongoing debate. Practices vary between synagogues. Most congregations strive {{to strike a balance between}} <b>inclusivity</b> and {{integrity}} of boundaries. The Jewish Reconstructionist Federation (JRF) has issued a non-binding statement attempting to delineate the process by which congregations set policy on these issues, and sets forth sample recommendations. These issues are ultimately decided by local lay leadership. [...] Mixed Jewish/Non-Jewish couples, however, are welcome in Reconstructionist congregations.|$|E
2500|$|In a [...] "reply to the editor" [...] of the National Post, Stuart Murray, {{president}} and CEO of the museum, gave his {{statement on the}} <b>inclusivity</b> of the museum's planned galleries, following various protests that appeared in media after December 2010. A month later, Murray's travel expenses {{at the cost of}} taxpayers, purportedly for meetings related to museum business, also came under scrutiny. In 2013, Clint Curle, former curator of the Holocaust gallery and current head of stakeholder relations at the CMHR, was interviewed by Catherine Chatterley about the Holocaust gallery, how the CMHR is defining the Holocaust, and the general content of the museum.|$|E

I look forward to working closely with him as a partner on areas of common interests to the Jewish and wider community". Janner-Klausner has since said of Rabbi Mirvis: [...] "he made some very positive noises about <b>inclusivity</b> and working together and it was really well received. It’s not playing out in reality, unfortunately." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Malaysian {{government}} {{promotes a}} moderate version of Sunni Islam called Islam Hadhari. Islam Hadhari {{was introduced by}} former Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. It is meant to encourage a balanced approach to life, and encourages <b>inclusivity,</b> tolerance, and looking outwards. The qualities it values are knowledge, hard work, honesty, good administration, and efficiency. The Islamic party PAS desires a stricter interpretation of Islam {{and the promotion of}} Islamic law. Due to Islam being the state religion, many mosques and other religious services are supported by the government. Control of the mosques is usually done on a state rather than a federal level. The charitable Zakāt tax is collected by the government, and the government supports those wishing to make the pilgrimage to Mecca. In 1985 Kassim Ahmed wrote a book called [...] which promoted Quranism, but it was subsequently banned by the Malaysian government.|$|E
2500|$|Gradually Weizmann {{set up a}} {{separate}} following from Moses Gaster and L.J. Greenberg in London. [...] Manchester became an important intellectual resource for Zionism in Britain. [...] He made a valuable contribution to liberalism, encouraging journalism on the Manchester Guardian. [...] Through editor C P Scott, Weizmann was mentor to Harry Sacher, and two other distinguished young men, Israel Sieff, and Simon Marks (founders of Marks & Spencer). [...] Weizmann formed a friendship with another import/export merchant from Russia, Asher Ginzberg, a writer who would be essential to the WZF's Zionist <b>inclusivity,</b> urging against [...] "repressive cruelty" [...] to the Arabs. He regularly travelled by train to London to discuss spiritual and cultural Zionism with writers like Ginzberg whose pen name was Ahad Ha'am. He stayed at Ginzberg's home in Hampstead, from whence he lobbied Whitehall, beyond his job as Director of the Admiralty for Manchester.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2014, President elect Paul Estrin {{published}} a blog {{post on the}} Green Party's website criticizing the actions of Hamas during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. In his article, [...] "Why Gaza Makes Me Sad", Estrin talked about Hamas' [...] "desire to obliterate" [...] the State of Israel and how the terrorist group uses children as human shields. [...] Estrin's blog post was subsequently deleted by the party, with many party seniors and decision makers, including Elizabeth May, distancing themselves from Estrin, with {{a large majority of}} the party calling on him to resign. On August 5, Estrin resigned, criticizing the party for betraying their commitment to values of <b>inclusivity</b> and open public discourse. [...] Elizabeth May accepted the resignation of Estrin, stating that he was not forced to resign but did so of his own volition. May has said that the problem with his statements were the [...] "confusion" [...] they caused because they differed from party lines, but confirmed that Estrin was indeed a [...] "true Green".|$|E
2500|$|Nee {{taught that}} there should only be one church in every city, that Christians should meet {{together}} simply as believers {{living in the same}} city regardless of differences in doctrine or practice. Nee believed that this would eliminate divisions between Christians and provide the broadest basis upon which all believers could meet. Both Nee and Lee emphasized the New Testament's references to churches by the name of the city (for example, in Acts, the Christians in Jerusalem being referred to as [...] "the church which was at Jerusalem" [...] (NKJV), as well as other verses with the same convention, including 1 Corinthians 1:2; Revelation 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7 and 14). Since Nee and Lee taught {{that there should}} only be one church in each city, and that that city was the extent of a church's jurisdiction, members of the local churches usually refer to their congregations as [...] "the church in (city name)." [...] However, they assert that such statements are not to be taken as a claim of exclusivity, but rather <b>inclusivity.</b> (see Witness Lee, ‘The Basis for the Believers' Oneness in the Church’).|$|E
2500|$|Hegemonic {{dominance}} and exclusion: In Rethinking the Public Sphere, Nancy Fraser offers a feminist revision of Habermas' historical {{description of the}} public sphere, and confronts it with [...] "recent revisionist historiography". She refers to other scholars, like Joan Landes, Mary P. Ryan and Geoff Eley, when she argues that the bourgeois public sphere was in fact constituted by a [...] "number of significant exclusions." [...] In contrast to Habermas’ assertions on disregard of status and <b>inclusivity,</b> Fraser claims that the bourgeois public sphere discriminated against women and other historically marginalized groups: [...] "... this network of clubs and associations – philanthropic, civic, professional, and cultural – was anything but accessible to everyone. On the contrary, it was the arena, the training ground and eventually the power base of a stratum of bourgeois men who were coming {{to see themselves as}} a “universal class” and preparing to assert their fitness to govern." [...] Thus, she stipulates a hegemonic tendency of the male bourgeois public sphere, which dominated at the cost of alternative publics (for example by gender, social status, ethnicity and property ownership), thereby averting other groups from articulating their particular concerns.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Cook and Warren {{complained to}} the BC Human Rights Tribunal that public schools in British Columbia {{discriminated}} against gays by failing to include information about them in curricula, and {{that the lack of}} such representation amounted to systemic discrimination. The Tribunal accepted their case, but as the hearing approached in 2006, the provincial government negotiated a settlement with the Correns by which the province committed itself to review the <b>inclusivity</b> of school curricula and would introduce a new elective course on social justice that would include sexual orientation, race, ethnicity and gender issues. The agreement stipulated that the Correns would be consulted about the section of the new course on sexual orientation and more broadly about the presentation of gays in the broader school curriculum. [...] It also stipulates that the government must solicit feedback directly from organization or groups, identified by the Correns, [...] "with expertise in sexual orientation, homophobia, and other issues of inclusion and diversity in the curriculum". Under the agreement, these organizations are allowed guaranteed input into the revision of any curriculum for any grade, which [...] "they consider should be given priority in light of sexual orientation issues". [...] One controversial feature of the agreement is that the provision of [...] "Alternative Delivery", which allows parents to opt their children out of parts of the curriculum, will be limited to specific courses.|$|E
