25|$|The Helmy Aerogypt was a British four-seat cabin {{monoplane}} {{designed and}} built by Egyptian S Helmy at Heston Aerodrome in 1938. The Aerogypt I was a low-wing cantilever monoplane initially powered by three 22hp (16kW) Douglas Sprite engines. The aircraft had an upward hinged roof that acted as a landing flap. Registered G-AFFG, it first flew in 1939. It later had the hinged roof removed, and was re-designated the Aerogypt II. Another modification added <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> to the horizontal tail surfaces, and was re-designated the Aerogypt III, and last flown in that configuration in September 1940.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} eight statically loaded extended <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> moment connections was undertaken at the Delft University of Technology to {{provide insight into}} the behaviour of this joint type up to collapse. The specimens were designed to confine failure to the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> and/or bolts without development of the full plastic moment capacity of the beam. The parameters investigated were the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> thickness and steel grade. The results show that an increase in <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> thickness results in an increase in the connection flexural strength and stiffness and a decrease in rotation capacity. Similar conclusions are drawn for the effect of the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> steel grade, though no major variations in the initial stiffness are observed. The failure modes involved weld failure in two test specimens, nut stripping in four tests and bolt fracture in the remaining, always after significant yielding of the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> and bolt bending. Comparisons of the joint ductility and the corresponding equivalent T-stub for the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> side are drawn. [URL]...|$|R

50|$|Miniature <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> {{potentials}} are {{the small}} (~0.4mV) depolarizations of the postsynaptic terminal {{caused by the}} release of a single vesicle into the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitter vesicles containing acetylcholine collide spontaneously with the nerve terminal and release acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction even without a signal from the axon. These small depolarizations are not enough to reach threshold and so an action potential in the postsynaptic membrane does not occur.During experimentation with MEPPs, it was noticed that often spontaneous action potentials would occur, called <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> spikes in normal striated muscle without any stimulus. It was believed that these <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> spikes occurred as a result of injury or irritation of the muscles fibers due to the electrodes. Recent experiments have shown that these <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> spikes are actually caused by muscle spindles and have two distinct patterns: small and large. Small <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> spikes have a negative onset without signal propagation and large <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> spikes resemble motor unit potentials (MUPs). Muscle spindles are sensory receptors that measure muscle elongation or stretch and relay the information to the spinal cord or brain for the appropriate response.|$|R
25|$|Because {{the actual}} bond stress varies {{along the length}} of a bar {{anchored}} in a zone of tension, current international codes of specifications use the concept of development length rather than bond stress. The main requirement for safety against bond failure is to provide a sufficient extension of the length of the bar beyond the point where the steel is required to develop its yield stress and this length must be at least equal to its development length. However, if the actual available length is inadequate for full development, special anchorages must be provided, such as cogs or hooks or mechanical <b>end</b> <b>plates.</b> The same concept applies to lap splice length mentioned in the codes where splices (overlapping) provided between two adjacent bars {{in order to maintain the}} required continuity of stress in the splice zone.|$|E
25|$|CANDU fuel bundles {{are about}} a half meter long and 10cm in diameter. They consist of {{sintered}} (UO2) pellets in zirconium alloy tubes, welded to zirconium alloy <b>end</b> <b>plates.</b> Each bundle is roughly 20kg, and a typical core loading is {{on the order of}} 4500-6500 bundles, depending on the design. Modern types typically have 37 identical fuel pins radially arranged about the long axis of the bundle, but in the past several different configurations and numbers of pins have been used. The CANFLEX bundle has 43 fuel elements, with two element sizes. It is also about 10cm (4inches) in diameter, 0.5 m (20in) long and weighs about 20kg (44lb) and replaces the 37-pin standard bundle. It has been designed specifically to increase fuel performance by utilizing two different pin diameters. Current CANDU designs do not need enriched uranium to achieve criticality (due to their more efficient heavy water moderator), however, some newer concepts call for low enrichment to help reduce the size of the reactors.|$|E
2500|$|As in {{the case}} of an axially loaded bar, in {{practice}} the shear stress may not be uniformly distributed over the layer; so, as before, the ratio F/A will only be an average ("nominal", [...] "engineering") stress. [...] However, that average is often sufficient for practical purposes. [...] Shear stress is observed also when a cylindrical bar such as a shaft is subjected to opposite torques at its ends. [...] In that case, the shear stress on each cross-section is parallel to the cross-section, but oriented tangentially relative to the axis, and increases with distance from the axis. Significant shear stress occurs in the middle plate (the [...] "web") of I-beams under bending loads, due to the web constraining the <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> ("flanges").|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the great}} {{interest}} in and emphasis on high-speed wind-tunnel tests, {{it has become increasingly}} important to provide a support system which affects the tunnel flow and the flow over the model as little as possible. One type of support which is being used a great deal at the present time is the so-called reflection-plane mount. This mount derives its name {{from the fact that the}} model consists of only half of the prototype wing or airplane, mounted on its plane of symmetry. Ordinarily the model is mounted next to one of the tunnel walls, but many variations of mounting have been used. A circular <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> may or may not be mounted as a metrical portion of the installation. The purpose of the tests, described in this report, was to determine the interference effects of the tunnel wall or <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> on the model, the interference effects of the model on the <b>end</b> <b>plate,</b> and the true forces acting on the model and <b>end</b> <b>plate.</b> It was also desired to determine the forces acting on the portion of the model in the boundary layer and to determine the effects of gaps between the wing and <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> and between the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> and tunnel wall. ...|$|R

2500|$|Muscle {{relaxation}} and paralysis can theoretically occur by interrupting function at several sites, including {{the central nervous}} system, myelinated somatic nerves, unmyelinated motor nerve terminals, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the motor <b>end</b> <b>plate,</b> and the muscle membrane or contractile apparatus. Most neuromuscular blockers function by blocking transmission at the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> of the neuromuscular junction. Normally, a nerve impulse arrives at the motor nerve terminal, initiating an influx of calcium ions, which causes the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then diffuses across the synaptic cleft. It may be hydrolysed by acetylcholine esterase (AchE) or bind to the nicotinic receptors located on the motor <b>end</b> <b>plate.</b> The binding of two acetylcholine molecules results in a conformational change in the receptor that opens the sodium-potassium channel of the nicotinic receptor. This allows [...] and [...] ions to enter the cell and [...] ions to leave the cell, causing a depolarization of the <b>end</b> <b>plate,</b> resulting in muscle contraction. Following depolarization, the acetylcholine molecules are then removed from the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> region and enzymatically hydrolysed by acetylcholinesterase.|$|R

This configuration allows a specimen to slide / expand horizontally while sliding along the polished glass. Thus, the contact zone between sample and the <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> does not buildup unnecessary shear friction, and a linear / isotropic stress field within the specimen is sustained.|$|E

40|$|International audienceConvective {{transports}} in the vertebral <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> (VEP) play {{a significant}} role in the homeostasis of the spine. A few studies hypothesised that the hydraulic resistance or effective permeability of the VEP could be dependant upon fluid-flow direction. Results were influenced by species, region of interest within the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> and pathology. Some results were contradictory. We propose an analytical model based on steady-state Newtonian flows in capillary media to develop a phenomenological analysis of convective transport through the VEP. This dependence was established using a biquadratic analytical function involving porosities of subchondral bone, capillary bed and cartilage <b>end</b> <b>plate.</b> Discussion of results provided a theoretical justification for variable and/or contradictory experimental results concerning the amount of energy lost by fluid during its course through the <b>end</b> <b>plate.</b> Tissue porosities and, especially, those relative to the capillary bed could strongly influence the dependence of fluid energy loss on flow direction and could potentially modify tissue homeostasis related to the day and night cycle...|$|R
40|$|In {{mammalian}} muscle a postnatal {{switch in}} functional properties of neuromuscular transmission occurs when miniature <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> currents become shorter and the conductance and Ca 2 + permeability of <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> channels increases. These changes {{are due to}} replacement during early neonatal development of the −subunit of the fetal acetylcholine receptor (AChR) by the −subunit. The long−term functional consequences of this switch for neuromuscular transmission and motor behavior of the animal remained elusive. We report that deletion of the −subunit gene caused in homozygous mutant mice the persistence of −subunit gene expression in juvenile and adult animals. Neuromuscular transmission in these animals is based on fetal type AChRs present in the <b>end</b> <b>plate</b> at reduced density.
