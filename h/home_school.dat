5|$|Between 2006 and 2007, Texas spent $7,275 {{per pupil}} ranking it below the {{national}} average of $9,389. The pupil/teacher ratio was 14.9, {{below the national}} average of 15.3. Texas paid instructors $41,744, {{below the national average}} of $46,593. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) administers the state's public school systems. Texas has over 1,000 school districts- all districts except the Stafford Municipal School District are independent from municipal government and many cross city boundaries. School districts have the power to tax their residents and to assert eminent domain over privately owned property. Due to court-mandated equitable school financing for school districts, the state has a controversial tax redistribution system called the"Robin Hood plan". This plan transfers property tax revenue from wealthy school districts to poor ones. The TEA has no authority over private or <b>home</b> <b>school</b> activities.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2000 This study {{investigated}} <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> as alternative form of educational provision in South Africa by focussing {{on the following}} aspects: • the nature of <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> as alternative form of educational provision; • <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> as alternative form of educational provision in the USA; and • the position of <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> as alternative form of educational provision in South Africa. The nature of <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> as alternative form of educational provision has been researched {{by means of a}} literature study. <b>Home</b> <b>schooling</b> within a system of educational provision has been investigated and it has been found that <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> cannot be categorised within existing terms because it includes aspects of both formal and non-formal education and excludes aspects of both. <b>Home</b> <b>schooling</b> has moved from an initially traditional form of education to an alternative form of education, enjoying growing support at an international level. As an alternative form of educational provision in the USA <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> has a sound legal foundation and has become an acceptable educational alternative. Home schoolers in the USA are very diverse with regard to various aspects, including reasons for <b>home</b> <b>schooling.</b> In regard of the structure of <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> there are two extremes, namely the orthodox structuralists and the proponents of unstructured learning, with the largest group of home schoolers somewhere between these extremes. Available research indicates clearly that academically home schoolers perform very well and <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> does not in any way disadvantage them with regard tosocial-emotional development or socialisation. Policy makers in the USA seem to be increasingly of the opinion that there should be some form of cooperation between public <b>schools</b> and <b>home</b> schoolers. The literature study on the origin and development of <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> as alternative form of educational provision in South Africa revealed that, although the Constitution does not contain a stipulation granting parents an explicit right to <b>home</b> <b>schooling,</b> it does not make homeschooling unconstitutional. New regulations regarding <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> have been announced by the government in November 1999 and are already operative. The empirical research revealed that <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> in South Africa has grown phenomenally over the past two years. In South Africa home schoolers are also diverse regarding various aspects, but generally spend much time on formal lessons and mostly use previously prepared curricula. It seems as if educational reasons are the most important and religious beliefs the second most important reason for <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> in South Africa. Some of the most important recommendations of this study are firstly that a partnership should be established between government and home schoolers. The government should take notice of research on <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> and the opportunities that <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> presents. <b>Home</b> <b>schooling</b> as alternative form of educational provision can be supplementary to the existing system of educational provision. Finally, education policy makers should also reconsider legislation regarding compulsory education rather than compulsory schooling. Doctora...|$|R

The purpose of this study is to examine the concepts of emotional intelligence and social skills in <b>home</b> <b>schooled</b> students. One hundred <b>home</b> <b>schooled</b> students and their parents participated in this study by completing emotional intelligence and social skills questionnaires. Results of the study support the hypotheses that the <b>home</b> <b>schooled</b> students would have higher levels of social skills and lower scores on the problem behaviors scale than the standardization population. In regards to emotional intelligence, differences were found among the elementary and secondary grade levels of the <b>home</b> <b>schooled</b> children. <b>Home</b> <b>schooled</b> elementary students achieved higher scores than the standardization population on two of the seven areas measured.

There are some reasons underlining this choice and the form of instruction chosen. There are some advantages of choosing this kind of program, one of which is to maximize their potency in the field they fell interested in without disturbing the <b>school</b> schedule. The <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> is divided into three types, namely single <b>home</b> <b>schooling,</b> plural <b>home</b> <b>schooling</b> and community <b>home</b> <b>schooling.</b> All those three have its own strengths and weaknesses with all their consequences.
