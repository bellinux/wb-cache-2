2500|$|At {{this time}} Brahms also chose {{to change his}} image. Having been always clean-shaven, in 1878 he {{surprised}} his friends by growing a beard, writing in September to the conductor Bernhard Scholz [...] "I am coming with a large beard! Prepare your wife for a most awful sight." [...] The singer George Henschel recalled that after a concert [...] "I saw a man unknown to me, rather stout, of middle height, with long hair and a full beard. In a very deep and hoarse voice he introduced himself as 'Musikdirektor Müller'... an <b>instant</b> <b>later,</b> we all found ourselves laughing heartily at the perfect success of Brahms's disguise". The incident also displays Brahms's love of practical jokes.|$|E
2500|$|He {{achieved}} renown {{by a great}} experiment made in 1834 – {{the measurement}} of the velocity of electricity in a wire. He cut the wire at the middle, to form a gap which a spark might leap across, and connected its ends to the poles of a Leyden jar filled with electricity. Three sparks were thus produced, one {{at each end of}} the wire, and another at the middle. He mounted a tiny mirror on the works of a watch, so that it revolved at a high velocity, and observed the reflections of his three sparks in it. The points of the wire were so arranged that if the sparks were instantaneous, their reflections would appear in one straight line; but the middle one was seen to lag behind the others, because it was an <b>instant</b> <b>later.</b> The electricity had taken a certain time to travel from the ends of the wire to the middle. This time was found by measuring the amount of lag, and comparing it with the known velocity of the mirror. Having got the time, he had only to compare that with the length of half the wire, and he could find the velocity of electricity. His results gave a calculated velocity of 288,000 miles per second, i.e. faster than what we now know to be the speed of light (...) , but were nonetheless an interesting approximation.|$|E

40|$|Imagine you are {{standing}} in an art museum, mesmerized by an enormous canvas of turbulent paint. Though you find no recognizable images, you are fascinated by the swirling movements of rich azures and cobalt blues. Your eyes follow the artist’s long, energetic brush strokes across the work, and you {{feel a sense of}} motion inside your body. Suddenly, your attention is caught by a small area of densely applied paint—a deep crimson. You linger. The thick color glows. As your awareness of the surroundings dim, the bright spot on the canvas expands, and the sensuous color seems to flow into you. You are immersed. <b>Instants</b> <b>later,</b> the bond breaks, as your attention shifts to a nearby conversation. What a viewer is experiencing in such moments of immersion is a shift in the ordinary sense of one’s bodily boundaries. For an instant, viewer and art work seem to merge...|$|R

60|$|Unluckily, Mike {{had been}} left at the gate as the sentinel. A more upfortunate {{selection}} {{could not have been}} made; the true-hearted fellow having so much self-confidence, and so little forethought, as to believe the gates impregnable. He had lighted a pipe, and was smoking as tranquilly as he had ever done before, in his daily indulgences of this character, when the unhung leaf came tumbling in upon the side where he sat; nothing saving his head but the upper edge's lodging against the wall. At the same moment, a dozen Indians leaped through the opening, and sprang into the court, raising the yells already described. Mike followed, armed with his shillelah, for his musket was abandoned in the surprise, and he began to lay about him with an earnestness that in nowise lessened the clamour.
