2500|$|Johnston's {{music is}} {{frequently}} cited for its [...] "pure and childlike soul". He gathered a local {{following in the}} 1980s by passing out tapes of his music while working at a McDonald's in Austin, Texas. His notoriety among underground circles was launched once Nirvana's Kurt Cobain began wearing a T-shirt that featured artwork from Johnston's 1983 album <b>Hi,</b> <b>How</b> <b>Are</b> You. In 2005, Johnston {{was the subject of}} the documentary The Devil and Daniel Johnston.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, the Sound Exchange {{record store}} in Austin, Texas {{commissioned}} Johnston {{to paint a}} mural of the <b>Hi,</b> <b>How</b> <b>Are</b> You? frog (also known as [...] "Jeremiah the Innocent") from the album's cover. After the record store closed in 2003, the building remained unoccupied until 2004 when a Mexican grill franchise called Baja Fresh took ownership and decided to remove the wall that held the mural. A {{group of people who}} lived in the neighborhood convinced the managers and contractors to keep the mural intact. The building now houses a Thai restaurant called [...] "Thai, How Are You".|$|E

In 2009, {{it was announced that}} Matt Groening had chosen Johnston to perform at the edition of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that he curated in May 2010, in Minehead, England. Later that year, he was invited by rock band Cage the Elephant to appear at Starry Nights Fest, a music festival in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Johnston performed a brief solo set before being joined on stage by Cage, who backed performances of several songs, including [...] "Speeding Motorcycle" [...] and [...] "True Love Will Find You in the End". Also that year, Dr. Fun Fun and Smashing Studios developed an iPhone platform game called <b>Hi,</b> <b>How</b> <b>Are</b> You. The game is similar to Frogger, but features Johnston's art and music. It is said Daniel Johnston played it during its development and liked it, although he was not familiar with the iPhone.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hi</b> dear, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> your day?” In {{the rarest}} of cases the responded would answer: “I {{had so much}} fun when {{entering}} the customer data into our Enterprise Systems. ” However, the usage of Enterprise Systems is nowadays for many employees a key element of their working activities. Therefore, their motivation to use these systems consistently is essential for organizations to ensure transparency and process accuracy. While today most software products have a high usability, they lack in positive user experiences such as fun. One trend having the potential to solve this issue is Gamification. Using mechanisms of traditional games such as achievements or rankings is successfully implemented in private applications such as social networks (e. g. Facebook) or online traveling portals (e. g. tripadvisor). These mechanisms motivate individuals to perform certain activities they would otherwise not do. Gabe Zichermann – a visionary of Gamification – explained this phenomenon as following: Games are the only force in the known universe that can get people to take actions against their self-interest, in a predictable way, without using force. The principle of Gamification and its potential in organizations is presented in this book chapter...|$|R
40|$|There {{is concern}} that the {{violations}} of conventional grammar (both accidental and deliberate) often seen in text messages (e. g., <b>hi</b> [URL] <b>how</b> <b>is</b> ya?!!) could lead to difficulty in learning or remembering formal grammatical conventions. We examined whether the grammatical violations made by 244 British children, {{adolescents and young adults}} in their text messages was related to poorer performance on tasks of grammatical knowledge, including translating grammatically unconventional text messages into standard English. We found that variance in the production of grammatical violations in naturalistic messages was inconsistently predicted by grammatical task performance. Specifically, primary school children who made poorer grammar-based spelling choices were more likely to make more grammatical violations in their everyday messages, and university students who failed to correct more grammatical errors in a given set of messages {{were also more likely to}} make such errors in their own messages. There were no significant relationships for secondary school students. We conclude that using unconventional grammar when texting is not a consistent sign of poor grammatical abilities, although there may be links between some aspects of grammatical skill and grammatical violations in text messages...|$|R

Charlotte and I gave five-minute and two-minute alerts. We sang the cleanup song with the children, and we asked them to stop playing and put things away. But it wasn’t working.

He just doesn’t seem right, ” Michelle blurted out. “I saw a news item a month or so ago that said that Tylenol ® wasn’t very safe—something about it not being good for the liver.
