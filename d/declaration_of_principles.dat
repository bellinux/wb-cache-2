In 1988, he was a proponent of the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict (1948), and voted {{for the establishment of}} the State of Palestine {{at a meeting of the}} PNC in Algiers. In 1993, Said quit his membership to the Palestinian National Council, to protest the internal politics that led to the signing of the Oslo Accords (<b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Principles</b> on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, 1993), which he thought had unacceptable terms, and because the terms had been rejected by the Madrid Conference of 1991.|$|E

25|$|The {{party is}} one of the oldest {{political}} parties in the UK, founded in 1904 as a split from the Social Democratic Federation. It consistently argues against vanguardism and denies the possibility of reforming capitalism in the interests of the working class.

25|$|At the 1934 National Convention of the Socialist Party, Thomas' {{connection}} with the Militants deepened when he backed a radical <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Principles</b> authored by his long-time associate from the radical pacifist journal The World Tomorrow, Devere Allen. The Militants swept to majority control of the party's governing National Executive Committee at this gathering, and the Old Guard retreated to their New York fortress and formalized their factional organization as the Committee for the Preservation of the Socialist Party, complete with a shadow Provisional Executive Committee and an office in New York City.|$|E

50|$|In June 1981, Secretary Block invited {{agricultural}} and educational leaders {{willing to work}} cooperatively toward the common goal of educating {{the public about the}} role of agriculture to a workshop in Washington, DC. The resulting task force recommended that the U.S. Department of Agriculture help coordinate local and state Agriculture in the Classroom efforts. The <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Principle</b> was announced by Secretary of Agriculture John Block with a fanfare on Ag Day, March 21, 1983. The <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Principle</b> spelled out the purpose of the Agriculture in the Classroom program and featured the signatures of all seven living former Secretaries of Agriculture. There are now Agriculture in the Classroom programs in every state and many U.S. Territories. Canada, with assistance from USDA, developed an Agriculture in the Classroom program in every Province as well as a national organization. Countries around the world are interested in Agriculture in the Classroom because they have experienced the same needs in agricultural education.|$|R

25|$|At {{the second}} {{conference of the}} party, a {{resolution}} was passed forbidding members from holding office in trade unions – although this was overturned by the EC as ultra vires and contrary to the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>principles.</b> E. J. B. Allen continued to write articles attacking trade unions and supporting De Leonist style Socialist Industrial Unions. Such arguments were ultimately rejected, {{on the grounds that}} a socialist union would have a tiny number of members so long as socialists remained in a minority; but when socialists attained a majority all unions would become socialist unions by having socialists members.|$|E
25|$|After the Japanese {{bombing of}} Pearl Harbor {{in the fall}} of 1941, and the {{declaration}} of war, however, the U.S. defense of itself and war against fascism was supported by most of the remaining Militants and all of the Old Guard. However, the Socialist Party adopted a compromise position that did not openly oppose American participation in the war. Its failure to support the war created a rift with many leaders, like the Reuther Brothers of the United Auto Workers. The pacifist wing of the party did not advocate engaging in any systematic antiwar activities such as the general strike endorsed by the 1934 <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Principles.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{membership}} of the Socialist Party approved the 1934 <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Principles</b> in its referendum vote, a victory which moved the Old Guard towards the exits — although factional fighting into 1936. The leaders of the Old Guard formed a new rival organization to the Socialist Party, the Social Democratic Federation in 1936 and somewhat reluctantly endorsed Franklin Roosevelt for president in the election of that year. They also worked to establish the American Labor Party (ALP) a labor-oriented umbrella organization that included both socialist and non-socialist elements, putting forward both its own candidates as well as endorsing those of the Democratic and Republican parties.|$|E

It stated what had become obvious in most national YMCAs; a global viewpoint was more necessary, and that in doing so, the YMCAs {{would have to take}} political stands, especially so in international challenges. In 1985 the World Council of YMCAs passed a resolution against apartheid, and anti-apartheid campaigns were formed under the leadership of Lee Soo-Min (Korea), the first Asian secretary general of the World Alliance.|$|E
25|$|Naturally, in an {{organisation}} {{of critical}} thinkers that has endured for a century, {{the existence of}} some disagreement is inevitable. Indeed, it would be true {{to say that a}} fair number of internal debates and disagreements have arisen in the Socialist Party concerning issues not covered by the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>Principles</b> and not addressed in the initial membership test – in other words, issues which are somewhat peripheral or incidental rather than core and fundamental. These issues have included the Party's exact attitude to trade unionism, its view of capitalist economic crises, and – in more recent years – whether something akin to law will exist in socialist society.|$|E
