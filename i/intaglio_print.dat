40|$|The {{investigation}} of influence of <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing</b> {{on the strength}} characteristics of banknote paper was carried out. The investigation {{was based on a}} comparison of the changes of 1 hryvnia and 2 hryvnia banknotes. These denominations were selected because of their similar physical and functional properties. The only essential distinction is application of <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing</b> for 2 hryvnia banknote production and non-usage of <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing</b> for 1 hryvna banknote production. The experimental investigations showed a considerable worsening of tensile strength when deterioration of banknotes had increased. Though, the worsening of tensile strength because of deterioration is a little less for the 2 hryvna banknotes. On the other hand, in case of new banknotes the tensile strength is higher for 1 hryvna. So, the strengthening effect of <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing</b> becomes apparent in banknotes circulation, so far as the <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing</b> hardens banknotes substrate by means of paper?s structure compaction. ????????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????????????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????. ?????????? ???????????? ????????, ??? ?????????????????? ?????? ???????? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ??? ??????? ? ???????...|$|R

5000|$|Stipple {{engraving}} is {{a technique}} used to create tone in an <b>intaglio</b> <b>print</b> by distributing a pattern of dots of various sizes and densities across the image. The pattern is created on the printing plate either in engraving by gouging out the dots with a burin, or through an etching process. Stippling {{was used as an}} adjunct to conventional line engraving and etching for over two centuries, before being developed as a distinct technique in the mid-18th century.|$|E
50|$|Engraving for {{the purpose}} of printmaking creates plates for {{intaglio}} printing. Intaglio engravings are made by carving into a plate of a hard substance such as copper, zinc, steel, or plastic. Afterward ink is rubbed into the carved areas and away from the flat surface. Moistened paper is placed over the plate and both are run through the rollers of an intaglio press. The pressure exerted by the press on the paper pushes it into the engraved lines and prints the image made by those lines. In an <b>intaglio</b> <b>print,</b> the engraved lines print black.|$|E
50|$|Different tonal {{effects and}} vibrant colours can be {{achieved}} with the technique due to the depth of relief and differential inking that results from the collagraph plate's highly textured surface.

40|$|<b>Intaglio</b> <b>print,</b> as part {{of graphic}} art is a wide field which {{contains}} many different views and technical procedures. Every technique requires its own approach and many times its own tools. Materials and tools for graphic art have been developing through time, and can be easily bought today, although mostly expensive. The process and principle of making graphic art and techniques itself stayed mostly unchanged till present day. Understanding of this process can open views of how to combine techniques and how to change traditional tools and materials with more inexpensive and easy to get everyday stuff. The main goal {{of this kind of}} approach was to find new virtual and esthetic alternatives of graphic art, but in school the conditions for graphic art are usually poor, there is lack of equipment, some techniques seem to be too complicated, so the approach to make thing easier is quite important. At this stage, the knowledge of processes, materials and techniques can be, beside of experiences, of great help. Technical approach towards the process of <b>intaglio</b> <b>print</b> is the contents of this diploma. From different sources it gives, for each technique in particular the information about its history, characteristics and the description of technical process from the preparation of the matrix till the final proof. After descriptions of most common used materials, tools and preparations in traditional approach of an <b>intaglio</b> <b>print,</b> it follows also some descriptions of the same techniques in simpler manner, which might be used in primary schools. The quality of the expression {{is not the same as}} with the traditional <b>intaglio</b> <b>print,</b> but these techniques can serve as the beginning of knowing the intaglio problems, both technical and visual and as such they can serve well. In my opinion, this kind of experimentation does not harm or jeopardize the purity of graphic tradition but can enlarge its varieties of expression. As an graphic amateur and an admirer of art I do not take easy on the subject, but as a future teacher of art, I think that graphic expressions deserve bigger place in schools in its normal, or even better in its simpler form...|$|E

Each technic has its own characteristics that help us in our artistic expression thus enabling us to create and illustrate our own language, view and purpose. In pedagogical sense, combining different technics of intaglio brings some diversity and something different to schoolchildren. The teacher will also save some time which will give him even more opportunities to create with children. ...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages #-#) As an artist, {{one of my}} interests {{has been}} the observation and documentation through photographs of textures and surfaces. This interest has often brought me to photograph walls because they are rich and varied in texture. In the course of photographing these walls, I became increasingly aware of the great variety of man-made marks on them, from elaborate murals to simple graffiti. Rather than making traditional silver prints, I decided to transfer the images to commercially prepared photo-sensitive zinc plates from which I could then achieve an <b>intaglio</b> <b>print</b> {{in an attempt to}} enrich and interpret, as well as record, the aesthetically interesting surfaces. I was content with this activity until the energy of the graffiti seemed to compel me to become more personally involved in a creative and participatory manner with these surfaces. All of the images were photographed with a 35 mm camera on black and white film (usually Kodak Plus X). The selected images were then transferred by use of an enlarger from the 35 mm negatives to 9 " x 12 " sheets of Kodak Autoscreen film (an orthochromatic film with a 133 dot per line halftone built into the emulsion) producing a positive halftone image.

40|$|This book {{surveys the}} history of the {{techniques}} of engraving, etching and plate printing - i. e. that of manual intaglio printmaking processes - from its beginning in the 1430 s until today. These developments are observed {{in the light of the}} coherence between the technique of the <b>intaglio</b> <b>print</b> (such as its materials and methods of production); the ‘style’ or outward appearance of the print; the creator of the print; and the fashion typical of a particular social group, place and time. Economic, educational and social aspects are discussed, as well as the dissemination of the trade of intaglio printmaking. The author shows how intaglio printmaking developed steadily from the mid-fifteenth century, with the invention of the roller press and the etching of printing plates. By 1525 intaglio printmaking techniques could be said to have reached maturity and spread east and west following the European trade routes and colonisation. Further developments in plate-making resulted from a series of inventions and reinventions. After the abolition of the guilds on the European continent around 1800, and the introduction of photography and the expansion of the graphic industry, the engraving of images became a mere mechanical procedure. The handcrafted print made way for the large-scale mechanised graphic industry which emerged in the middle of the nineteenth century. Consequently artist-etchers withdrew to an elite position to concentrate on the manual aspects of printmaking, which is the situation today. This comprehensively illustrated study is the first of its kind to cover all elements of the trade of engraving and etching throughout six centuries. Based on an exhaustive number of primary sources it will be an essential resource for collectors, curators, conservators, printmakers and students of technical art history...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 14) Personal Statement The monotype {{provides for}} an ideal marriage between {{the techniques of}} painting and printmaking. The opportunity to improvise and to work sequentially {{is one of its}} enchantments. In juxtaposition to the <b>intaglio</b> <b>print</b> method, it is especially rewarding to create images freely with a minimum of the mechanical process. A recent viewing of the masterful work of Edgar Degas stimulated my continuing pursuit of this particular medium. Degas??? use of pastels, superimposed upon his monotypes, led me to strengthen my own prints by the addition of various drawing approaches. Also, his involvement with the Japanese print coincided with my own special interest. An awareness of the physical environment, plus an attitude toward pictorial landscape influenced by Japanese prints, has helped shape my imagery. The San Fernando Valley and the surrounding mountains have been my proving ground. I have interpreted this familiar terrain in a multitude of ways, frequently altering my vantage point to encompass a broad planar valley view. The viewpoint of the current series is modeled after those earlier landscapes. the Cloud-scapes, with their emphasis on line and negative space, reveal elements derived from the Japanese print. The Astro-scapes are, in a sense, my private refuge from man???s obliteration of the natural attributes of our land. These images form space through a system containing both close color tonality and vibrant luminous surfaces. They were created by embellishing areas with microscopic shapes, akin to Field painting; but utilizing a personal imagery. With very few materials one can conjure visual wizardry, which is actually a grouping of dots, strokes and lines over a rolled up ground color combined with wet transparancies, suggesting mists, clouds and amorphous space. Pure color was interwoven in some of these compositions, but, since the color areas were minute in relation to the scale of the total print, the effect {{is similar to that of}} a tapestry. Most of these prints were perceived as though one were seeing them from a great distance. All the images are fantasies designed to offer a fresh visual experience to the viewer...|$|E
40|$|Printmaking one of {{the five}} basic area of {{creation}} in visual art. It represents an extremely interesting art field. The very base of each printmaking is a drawing and a motive, which is represented by it. Light-dark contrasts which arise help to a greater visual art expression. It's known that the drawing can be printed from different matrixes. It takes quite a lot of time for techniques of <b>intaglio</b> <b>print</b> and other graphic techniques to be carried out. In my master thesis I analysed the use of new materials and tools making printmaking techniques of intaglio printing. My thesis consists of three parts- theoretical, practical and pedagogical part. In my theoretical part I focused on the elements of art light-dark, which is the basic element of printmaking technique and my master’s thesis, too. We can create it with different elements of art and plastic variables, among which I chose four basic elements of art: shape, light-dark, line and pixel and I used them, too. I decided for texture in plastic variables, together with number and density. I also talked about the modelation and its connection with the elements of art- light-dark. I presented some of Slovenian and foreign printmaking artists and their works and I found out what brightness keys were used in separate work. I chose the following graphic artists: Morandi, Picasso, Kovačič, Rembrandt, Borčič. I also explained the process of printmaking techniques of intaglio printing which I dealt with in my second part of my master's thesis. My author part consists of two parts. In the first part I used standard materials and tools. With different techniques of intaglio printing I used different elements of art and plastic variables which enable to carry out the element light- dark. I also placed my work in brightness key and described its expressive value. I analysed the use of new materials and tools which I later used in my pedagogical part, too {{in the second part of}} my thesis. In my pedagogical part I directly explored non-standard materials for intaglio printing in learning process. I did it in the primary school Franceta Bevka in Tolmin in elective course art edducation. Carrying out this technique {{one of the}} very important things is good organization of the teacher, together with a well selected task and motive, the correct material and the right equipment in the Art classroom. The best is introductory motivation, carrying out the techniques, teacher's positive energy and cooperation and help among students. Teachers don’t often practise printmaking techniques because they’re demanding and expensive. In my thesis I wanted to search for cheap materials which would make this technique more affordable, as far as the give many creative and technical encouragement. The majority of schools don’t give enough financial support to printmaking techniques. Zinc panels and additional material for gravure printing are quite expensive. I wanted to find alternative for those materials perpsex, plastic foils, crilex, CDs [...] ) which are less expensive. The needles which I create the motive were replaced with nails, tools for linocut, which should be in every classroomand engraving pens. I used ordinary and replacing elements and printmaking tools. In the beginning I put down some questions which I tried to answer. I analysed students' experience with questionnaires they had with a certain material and printmaking tool. I also got some results with their works. All the datas helped me to find out which material or tool is the most suitable for the printmaking technique, which is the most interesting and which cause the least problems to students. The results were firstly shown for each work...|$|E
40|$|The artist's imagery mainly {{consists}} of carrousel horses and reptiles. The {{only thing that}} relates {{the images of the}} reptiles and the carrousel horses in the artist's work is the fact that she finds both images fascinating and intriguing, but at the same time, finds both of these images some what repulsive and frightening. As a child, the artist developed a fascination for carrousel horses and reptiles. At this time these images mainly inspired feelings of fear in the artist. In the artist's opinion, carrousel horses seem to be frantic and frenzied. The artist feels that this aspect of carrousel horses makes them an image with expressive possibilities and she attempts to capture feelings of fear, curiosity and fascination in her prints. The artist is amazed at the variety of colors and textures found on reptiles. She finds them interesting images because although most reptiles are menacing creatures, they are also beautiful and exotic. The artist feels that this aspect of the reptile makes it an intriguing subject matter to work with. Intaglio is a form of printmaking in which a metal plate, traditionally copper or zinc, is manipulated by certain techniques such as: line etch (where a dry-point needle is used to scratch the surface of the plate onto which hard ground [an acid resistant, waxy substance] has been applied and the plate is etched in acid to incise the lines and form a line drawing); and aquatint (a technique to achieve a wide range of tones in an <b>intaglio</b> <b>print).</b> Aquatint has an appearance similar to that of a water color wash. To create the aquatint tonal areas, powdered rosin is sprinkled evenly over the plate and the plate is then heated until the rosin melts and adheres to the plate. The areas that are to remain white are covered with a hard ground "block out. " The plate is etched in acid {{for a period of time}} to be determined by the artist and is then taken out and rinsed with water to stop the acid from etching the plate any further. This process is repeated until a desired range of tones are created. Another technique usually used is a hybrid combination of burnishing and scraping using a burnisher or scraper. A burnisher and a scraper are patented tools that are used to polish (burnish) and scrape (that is, cut/remove metal from the plate) the surface of the plate to create highlights, lighten an area, or to totally erase an incised area of the plate. Embossing is another form of intaglio printmaking in which three layers of illustration board are cut to form a positive image on a piece of dampened arches paper that is pressed into the carved image by means of a printing press. The deeper the embossment, the more elevated the image will be on the paper. Pressing the paper down into the layers of illustration board forms an embossed image. No ink is used to create the image. Thus, this form of intaglio printmaking is known as "blind" printing, that is printing without ink. In the artist's work, all of the intaglio techniques discussed are used in combination with each other on the same plate to create a rich image. Researching different techniques has allowed the artist to have a better understanding and appreciation for the intaglio prints of historically renowned artists, who were printmakers before the artist.
