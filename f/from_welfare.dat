5|$|Inspired by her new teacher, Blu Rain (Paula Patton), Precious finally {{learns to}} read and write. She meets {{sporadically}} with social worker Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey), who learns about incest in the household when Precious reveals who fathered her children. While Precious is in the hospital giving birth to her second child, Abdul, she meets John McFadden (Lenny Kravitz), a nursing assistant who shows her kindness. Upon returning home, her mother carelessly drops 3-day-old Abdul and hits her, angrily declaring that Precious' revelation about the incest has resulted in their being cut off <b>from</b> <b>welfare.</b> Precious fights back and runs away from her home with Abdul. As they set out, she stops at a church window and watches the choir singing a Christmas hymn inside, imagining {{that she and her}} fantasy boyfriend are together and singing the song. Precious breaks into her school classroom seeking shelter. After Blu discovers her the next morning, she frantically calls local shelters looking for a safe place for Precious to stay. Later that night, Precious stays with Blu and her live-in girlfriend. The next morning, Blu takes her and Abdul to find assistance for them. She tells Precious that she will be able to continue her schooling while she raises Abdul in a halfway house.|$|E
25|$|Malakar {{was born}} in Capitol Hill, in {{downtown}} Seattle, the son of Jillian (Recchi) Blyth and Vasudeva Malakar. He later lived in the nearby suburb of Federal Way. His father, a musician, is a Bengali Indian immigrant born in Vrindavan, India. His mother is American-born, of Italian descent {{on one side and}} Dutch, English, and Irish ancestry on the other. His parents filed for divorce when he was three years old and had been separated for a year prior to doing so. When the divorce was filed, the family had almost no money coming in. His mother and the children were living in a Seattle apartment, and her only income was <b>from</b> <b>welfare.</b> His mother remarried, but his stepfather died soon afterwards. Although Malakar spent the majority of his formative years in the Seattle area, he has also lived in both California and Kauai, Hawaii, where he performed with the Hawaii Children's Theater group. While in Seattle, he spent three years with the Total Experience Gospel Choir.|$|E
25|$|Complex {{and long}} history shaped Polish attitudes towards the Jews and Jewish attitudes towards the Poles, but the anti-Jewish {{sentiment}} in Poland had reached its zenith {{in the years}} leading to the Second World War. Between 1935 and 1937 seventy-nine Jews were killed and 500 injured in anti-Jewish incidents. National policy was such that the Jews who largely worked {{at home and in}} small shops were excluded <b>from</b> <b>welfare</b> benefits according to American commentators. Nevertheless, the impact of right-wing extremism would have been hard to substantiate in towns with percentage of Jews equal or even higher than that of the non-Jewish Poles. In the provincial capital of Łuck Jews constituted 48.5% of the diverse multicultural population of 35,550 Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and others. Łuck had the largest Jewish community in the voivodeship. In the capital of Brześć in 1936 Jews constituted 41.3% of general population and some 80.3% of private enterprises were owned by Jews. The 32% of Jewish inhabitants of Radom enjoyed considerable prominence also, with 90% of small businesses in the city owned and operated by the Jews including tinsmiths, locksmiths, jewellers, tailors, hat makers, hairdressers, carpenters, house painters and wallpaper installers, shoemakers, as well as most of the artisan bakers and clock repairers. In Lubartów, 53.6% of the town's population were Jewish also along with most of its economy. In a town of Luboml, 3,807 Jews lived among its 4,169 inhabitants, constituting the essence of its social and political life.|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates <b>from</b> a <b>welfare</b> {{perspective}} three policy {{alternatives for}} dealing with Dutch disease problems originating from cyclical movements in commodity prices: fiscal rules for government expenditures, capital controls, and taxes on domestic lending. A DSGE model of a small open economy is developed, with a sectoral decomposition that features three distinctive characteristics: financial frictions, a learning-by-doing externality in the industrial sector, and a fraction of households being non-Ricardian (credit constrained). The model is calibrated using Chilean data. For each policy tool, optimal simple rules are analyzed <b>from</b> a <b>welfare</b> (Ramsey) perspective, describing how different households rank the several policy alternatives, and studying how each of the models features shapes the optimal policy design. A general conclusion of the analysis is that the included Dutch disease inefficiencies are of quantitatively limited relevance in analyzing the desirability of these policies <b>from</b> a <b>welfare</b> perspective...|$|R
