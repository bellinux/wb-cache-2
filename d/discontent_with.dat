5|$|During the 1990s, students, trade unionists, {{and other}} workers often {{demonstrated}} {{to express their}} growing <b>discontent</b> <b>with</b> Mugabe and Zanu-PF party policies. In 1996, civil servants, nurses, and junior doctors went on strike over salary issues. The general health of the population also began to significantly decline; by 1997 an estimated 25% of the population had been infected by HIV in a pandemic that was affecting most of southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Experience {{from the}} few cities where {{congestion}} pricing has been implemented shows that {{social and political}} acceptability is key. Public <b>discontent</b> <b>with</b> congestion pricing, or rejection of congestion pricing proposals, is due mainly to the inequality issues, the economic burden on neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general, and the fears that the revenues will become just another tax.|$|E
5|$|The New York draft riots (July 13–16, 1863), {{known at}} the time as Draft Week, were violent {{disturbances}} in Lower Manhattan, widely regarded as the culmination of working-class <b>discontent</b> <b>with</b> new laws passed by Congress that year to draft men to fight in the ongoing American Civil War. The riots remain the largest civil and racial insurrection in American history, aside from the Civil War itself.|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} {{approximately}} 1,000 Muslim men {{set out on}} late Friday from Medina and managed to circle around the Meccan forces. Early the next morning, they took {{a position on the}} lower slopes of the hill of Uhud. Shortly before the battle commenced, 'Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy (the chief of the Khazraj tribe) and his followers withdrew their support for Muhammad and returned to Medina, with reports suggesting Ibn Ubayy's <b>discontent</b> <b>with</b> the plan to march out from Medina to meet the Meccans. Ibn Ubayy and his followers would later receive censure in the Qur'an for this act.|$|E
5|$|Aburish {{asserts that}} Nasser was not distressed by his {{frequent}} relocations, which broadened his horizons {{and showed him}} Egyptian society's class divisions. His own social status was well below the wealthy Egyptian elite, and his <b>discontent</b> <b>with</b> those born into wealth and power grew throughout his lifetime. Nasser {{spent most of his}} spare time reading, particularly in 1933 when he lived near the National Library of Egypt. He read the Qur'an, the sayings of Muhammad, the lives of the Sahaba (Muhammad's companions), and the biographies of nationalist leaders Napoleon, Atatürk, Otto von Bismarck, and Garibaldi and the autobiography of Winston Churchill.|$|E

Although Johner unsuccessfully attempts to dominate her sexually, Wren dominates her with physical force and a dehumanizing attitude. In a 2013 Total Film interview, writer Joss Whedon expressed <b>discontent</b> <b>with</b> the casting of J. E. Freeman; the character was intended to have a mysterious element in his unscrupulous activities, which was overshadowed by typecasting.|$|E

40|$|The {{representations}} in the oeuvre of Charles Dickens of {{pulmonary tuberculosis}} (TB) characterize {{him as a}} realist and, at the same time, as a sentimentalist who saw TB {{as the result of}} hard-heartedness and the disintegration of communal ties based on affection and mutual support. Using the critical approach of the medical humanities, this article relates Dickens’s understanding about disease and therapy to problems in contemporary healthcare like the unexpected rise of TB in the 1980 s, the challenge posed by drug-resistant bacteria, and the <b>discontents</b> <b>with</b> the assembly-line modes of professionalized medical services. It argues that modern health policy and practice can profit from the records found in great works of literature of how communities in previous eras fought disease...|$|R
5|$|Arundel {{joined the}} {{opposition}} {{at an early}} point, and {{did not attend the}} Stamford parliament in July 1309, where Gaveston's return was negotiated. After Gaveston returned, his behaviour became even more offensive, and opposition towards him grew. In addition to this, there was great <b>discontent</b> <b>with</b> Edward II's failure to follow up his father's Scottish campaigns. On 16 March 1310, the king had to agree to the appointment of a committee known as the Lords Ordainers, who were {{to be in charge of}} the reform of the royal government. Arundel was one of eight earls among the twenty-one Ordainers.|$|E
5|$|In May 1969, <b>discontent</b> <b>with</b> Krieger's {{economic}} policies led to riots {{in the cities}} of Corrientes, Rosario and Córdoba. Krieger was removed, but the Onganía administration was unable to agree on an alternative economic policy. By 1970, the authorities were no longer capable of maintaining wage restraints, leading to a wage-price spiral. As the economy started to languish and import substitution industrialization ran out of steam, urban migration slowed. Per capita income fell, {{and with it the}} standard of living. Perón’s third term of office was characterized by an expansive monetary policy, which resulted in an uncontrolled rise in the level of inflation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1467, there were rumours that Warwick was now {{sympathetic}} to the Lancastrian cause, but even though he refused to come to court to answer the charges, the king accepted his denial in writing. In July the same year, {{it was revealed that}} Warwick's deputy in Calais, John, Lord Wenlock, was involved in a Lancastrian conspiracy, and early in 1469 another Lancastrian plot was uncovered, involving John de Vere, Earl of Oxford. It was becoming clear that the <b>discontent</b> <b>with</b> Edward's reign was widespread, a fact that Warwick could exploit.|$|E

However, the abstention rate and several forms of protest votes combined reached 41%, the highest in Argentine history, {{as a consequence of}} the popular <b>discontent</b> <b>with</b> the two main parties.

5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{broke out}} in the spring or summer of 1277 in north-eastern Bulgaria where the Mongol devastation was strongest. In the summer of 1277 Ivaylo confronted and defeated a plundering Mongol unit. Another victory followed soon and by autumn all Mongols were driven out of Bulgarian territory. Having achieved what had eluded the Bulgarian arms for decades, his popularity and reputation rose quickly. Among his followers were an increasing number of nobles who were <b>discontent</b> <b>with</b> the intrigues of Empress Maria. Ivaylo was hailed as Emperor by the people and many regions came under his control.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195–1203) had been troubled from the outset: the {{aristocracy}} conspired against him, his pressing demand for {{new sources of}} revenue was blocked by the refusal of Senate, clergy and merchants to contribute, while the lower and middle classes of the imperial capital frequently displayed their <b>discontent</b> <b>with</b> riots against corrupt officials. The most notable of these was a large-scale uprising in February 1200 against the warden of the praetorium, Constantinople's chief prison, John Lagos, which was bloodily suppressed by imperial troops.|$|E

5|$|At her Silver Jubilee in 1977, {{the crowds}} and {{celebrations}} were genuinely enthusiastic, but in the 1980s, public criticism {{of the royal family}} increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny. Elizabeth's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public. <b>Discontent</b> <b>with</b> the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, though Elizabeth's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.|$|E
5|$|At that time, Syrgiannes and John Kantakouzenos {{bought for}} {{themselves}} governorships in Thrace, where <b>discontent</b> <b>with</b> the old emperor was rife, and they quickly mobilized {{support for the}} younger Andronikos. Together with Alexios Apokaukos and Theodore Synadenos, they prepared to overthrow the aged Andronikos II in favour of his grandson. In Easter 1321, the younger Andronikos came to Adrianople, and the uprising broke out. Syrgiannes led a large army towards the capital, forcing the old emperor to negotiate. Consequently, on 6 June 1321, an agreement was reached which partitioned the empire. Young Andronikos III was recognized as co-emperor and given Thrace to govern as a quasi-appanage, setting up his court at Adrianople, while Andronikos II continued to rule from the capital, Constantinople, as senior emperor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Discontent</b> <b>with</b> Richard's actions {{manifested}} itself in the summer after he {{took control of the}} country, as a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son as a candidate for the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian Charles Ross proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} growing professional <b>discontents</b> <b>with</b> {{the increasing}} formalisation {{of social work}} practice exerted through systems of risk management and audit. Drawing on an ESRC-funded study of social work practices in children's statutory services, this paper provides a critique of instrumental approaches to risk management in social work. Through the discussion of three illustrative case examples, we argue that risk management is an inherently complex, contingent and negotiated activity. Social work practitioners are obliged to comply with risk reduction technologies, but informal processes {{continue to play a}} critical role in shaping decisions and actions in this relationship-based profession. From practitioner accounts, we identify key elements of the informal logics of risk management. We conclude that the bureaucratic–instrumental bias manifest in the modernisation of children's services, in privileging metrics and administrative power leaves the informal and relational aspects of practice under-emphasised and under-theorised. Suggestions are made about how practice might be advanced in the complex world of child welfare and protection...|$|R
60|$|My <b>discontents</b> <b>with</b> the Liberal {{party and}} my mental {{exploration}} {{of the quality of}} party generally is curiously mixed up with certain impressions of things and people in the National Liberal Club. The National Liberal Club is Liberalism made visible in the flesh--and Doultonware. It is an extraordinary big club done in a bold, wholesale, shiny, marbled style, richly furnished with numerous paintings, steel engravings, busts, and full-length statues of the late Mr. Gladstone; and its spacious dining-rooms, its long, hazy, crowded smoking-room with innumerable little tables and groups of men in armchairs, its magazine room and library upstairs, have just that undistinguished and unconcentrated diversity which is for me the Liberal note. The pensive member sits and hears perplexing dialects and even fragments of foreign speech, and among the clustering masses of less insistent whites his roving eye catches profiles and complexions that send his mind afield to Calcutta or Rangoon or the West Indies or Sierra Leone or the Cape....|$|R
