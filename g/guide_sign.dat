The highway widens to three lanes {{in each direction}} as it comes upon the interchange with NY27. The highway progresses its way northward through the interchange and passes by the first NY135 northbound shield {{in the middle of}} the exit. Trees mainly separate the expressway from the nearby highways and communities. After a short distance, the onramp from NY27 merges into the northbound lanes, and the highway continues northward.|$|E

In this paper, we aim to optimize the <b>guiding</b> <b>signs</b> {{for people in the}} comprehensive transportation terminal with a mathematical model, which describes the pedestrian's reaction, judgment, and perception of the outline about the <b>guiding</b> <b>signs,</b> as well as pedestrian's moving status through self-organized characteristic behavior. Furthermore, the model also reflects the information intensity of the <b>guiding</b> <b>signs</b> within the pedestrian's visual field which is taken as the influence level score of PGS. In order to solve the model, cellular automation (CA) is employed to simulate the characteristics of the pedestrians such as crowd moving and sign selection...|$|R
40|$|Frequently, a major traffic {{generator}} (MTG) {{attracts a}} significant volume of motorists that are unfamiliar with local areas. To properly serve traffic, {{it may be}} desirable to provide supplemental <b>guide</b> <b>signs</b> on adjacent highways, especially the nearby interchanges to direct motorists to such traffic generators efficiently. While there are sufficient guidance on <b>guide</b> <b>signs</b> on various federal and state manuals such as Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), {{there is a lack}} of adequate symbols and warrants for MTG <b>guide</b> <b>signing</b> for many states including Texas. In this research, the driving simulator is used to identify the position of MTG signs on top of <b>guide</b> <b>signs.</b> Symbols and logos used for MTG <b>guide</b> <b>signing</b> at freeway interchanges are tested, including the cases where exit lanes are on the right and on the left side of freeways. Positions of symbol and logo <b>signs</b> on Advance <b>Guide</b> <b>signs</b> and Exit Direction signs are investigated, and real symbol signs on interchanges in greater Houston area are conducted. Based on the results analysis of the experiments and questionnaire to different subjects, recommendations on positions of symbol and logo signs at freeway interchanges for MTG are proposed for the potential inclusion into the TxDOT Wayfinding Guidance...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. In urban areas, complex geometric situations make the <b>guide</b> <b>signing</b> task difficult. Since only a limited amount of space can be devoted to <b>guide</b> <b>signing</b> information, careful consideration must be given to the content of each <b>sign.</b> <b>Guide</b> <b>signs</b> should contain enough information to clearly convey upcoming interchange geometry, but not so much as to overload the driver's ability to process information. Previous studies have identified improving communication of the optional lane situation at a multilane exit as an area for further research. The lack of explicit instruction in the MUTCD on how to sign multilane interchanges has led to diverse, non-uniform <b>guide</b> <b>signing</b> applications around the nation. A review of nationwide practices as part of this research found that <b>guide</b> <b>signing</b> treatments are different between and within many states. The Texas Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices explicitly recommends signs for multilane exits. This research tested <b>guide</b> <b>signing</b> alternatives to better communicate the optional lane situation. One alternative included use of the phrase "MAY EXIT" to help communicate the optional lane. In addition, alternatives using diagonal arrows over the optional lane were also tested. Finally, forms of pull-thru signing were tested to see if they were of benefit in helping communicate the optional lane. The alternatives were tested against the current method of signing to determine if increased driver comprehension could be realized through the use of the alternative signs. The results of the laboratory experiment showed that marginal improvements in comprehension resulted from the use of alternative <b>guide</b> <b>signs.</b> Recommendations were made as to the use of freeway <b>guide</b> <b>signs,</b> and further areas of research were identified...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of an {{extensive}} literature survey {{on the state of the}} art practices in providing urban <b>guide</b> <b>signing.</b> The topics researched include, traffic management issues, system design, sign materials, and a focus on driver information processing abilities and their effect on sign design requirements. The guidance needs of drivers differ according to their knowledge of the route to their destination. Drivers may be classified as a &quot;stranger &quot; who is driving to a destination for the first time and is unfamiliar with the area, &quot;local-stranger &quot; who is broadly familiar with the area but not with the route or a &quot;local-local &quot; driver who is repeating a regular trip. It is the first two categories of driver who are most dependent on good <b>guide</b> <b>signing.</b> <b>Guide</b> <b>signs</b> provide information to drivers for the selection of roads, locating of offroute facilities and identifying other points of interest. <b>Guide</b> <b>signs</b> in the urban area have a role in traffic management plans. The principle goal of traffic management is minimizing congestion. The role of <b>guide</b> <b>signs</b> is to direct drivers to the routes that best serve their needs. Drivers seeking to pass through the urban area are directed to routes that have a high capacity and minimal acces...|$|R
