40|$|Research {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} <b>job</b> <b>expectations</b> are usually unrealistic prior to organisational entry, but tend to decline to more realistic levels with time and work experience (Nicholson & Arnold, 1991). The process of organisational socialisation is a useful perspective from which to view this expectation development. When organisational socialisation is unsuccessful, new employees are likely to experience 'reality shock': the physical and psychological response to the realisation that their <b>job</b> <b>expectations</b> have been inaccurate. Other immediate consequences of having inaccurate <b>job</b> <b>expectations</b> can include poor health outcomes and low job satisfaction. The primary aims {{of the present study}} were, 1) to measure a number of <b>job</b> <b>expectations</b> in a sample of police recruits, and to determine whether these <b>job</b> <b>expectations</b> change with time and experience, and 2) to investigate whether inaccurate <b>job</b> <b>expectations</b> are related to reality shock and poor health outcomes and low job satisfaction. It was hypothesised that <b>job</b> <b>expectations</b> would be related to reality shock and negative health outcomes and low job satisfaction. Furthermore, it was predicted that reality shock would mediate the relationship between <b>job</b> <b>expectations</b> and poor health outcomes and job satisfaction. These aims and hypotheses were tested by surveying police recruits during their first week of training, and again after six months' work experience. The results showed that expectations of both organisational stress and sexual discrimination were associated with reality shock. Organisational stress expectations were the only expectation variable to be related to reality shock, health outcomes, and job satisfaction. Regression analyses showed that reality shock mediated the link between organisational stress expectations and psychological distress, negative affect, and job satisfaction. These results were discussed with reference to {{the reliability and validity of}} the measures used and possible avenues for future research. The present study's results have important implications regarding current police recruit training procedures, and the usefulness of reality shock as a construct from which to understand the consequences of inaccurate <b>job</b> <b>expectations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} <b>job</b> <b>expectations,</b> experience, and met expectations of IT professionals in offshore software development and commercial banks in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach: For the study, quantitative research methodology was used and data were collected from 342 and 208 IT professionals engaged full-time in offshore software development and commercial banks, respectively, in Sri Lanka. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, paired sample t-test, independent sample t-test, and binary logistic regression were used appropriately for data analysis. Findings: The findings of the study led to identify <b>job</b> <b>expectations,</b> experience, and met expectations of IT professionals that discriminate between offshore software development and commercial banks. Originality/value: The literature provides evidence that <b>job</b> <b>expectations</b> of IT professionals in offshore software development are different from their counterparts in other comparable occupations. Therefore, the paper argues that sectoral differences in <b>job</b> <b>expectations,</b> experience, and met expectations of IT professionals are worthy of empirical investigation. Although the growth of the services sector has resulted in extensive employment opportunities for IT professionals in South Asia, the details on their <b>job</b> <b>expectations</b> and whether their expectations vary by the business sector remain obscure...|$|R

40|$|Following the {{publication}} of Perry and Wise’s essay on public service motivation (PSM) in 1990 and Perry’s PSM measurement scale in 1996, the concept of public service motivation has attracted wide attention and empirical research on its definition, measurement and incidence in the past twenty years. However, little empirical {{research has been conducted}} on PSM in Hong Kong. This research is intended to examine the dimensionality and generalizability of PSM in Hong Kong by using self-administered survey instruments with two groups of different respondents. Group 1 consisted of 55 students of Master of Public Administration of the University of Hong Kong (mostly full time public servants) whilst Group 2 consisted of 78 undergraduates from different faculties in the same university. Two separate survey instruments were used for group 1 and group 2 respondents. All 40 items of Perry’s PSM dimensions were included in the two survey instruments with additional 7 items and 8 items added for group 1 and group 2 respectively. The additional items were introduced to measure the relationship of variables including organizational commitment and <b>job</b> <b>expectation</b> and PSM dimensions. The findings did not reveal the PSM level of group 1 was higher than group 2. However, females were found having relatively higher PSM level than males under the dimension of Attraction to Public Policy Making. The independent variable of Organization Commitment was strongly and positively correlated with the dimensions of Commitment to Public Interest, Civic Duty and Self Sacrifice while <b>Job</b> <b>Expectation</b> was strongly and positively correlated with the dimensions of Attraction to Public Policy Making, Social Justice, Civic Duty and Self Sacrifice. This research contributed to provide better understanding and knowledge of PSM in the Hong Kong context especially on the influence of the independent variables of organizational commitment and <b>job</b> <b>expectation</b> on PSM dimensions. published_or_final_versionPublic AdministrationMasterMaster of Public Administratio...|$|E

The significant areas of discrepancy which affect work outcomes are pay, task importance, work pressure, encouragement of free speech and fairness to employees.
