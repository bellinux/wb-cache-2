Among them are pébrine, caused by the microsporidia Nosema bombycis, <b>grasserie,</b> caused by a virus, flacherie, caused by eating infected mulberry leaves or white muscardine disease, caused by the fungus Beauveria bassiana. The epidemic grew to a massive scale, and after having attacked the silkworms, other viruses began to infect the mulberry trees. The chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas, French minister of agriculture, was charged with stopping the epidemic. In face of sericulturers' call for help, he asked Louis Pasteur to study the disease, starting in 1865. For many years, Pasteur thought that pébrine was not a contagious disease. In 1870 he changed his view, and measures were enacted that caused the disease to decline.|$|E

40|$|With the {{techniques}} employed {{we have not}} been able to detect any qualitative differences between the particles visible in normal blood and in blood from cases of wilt disease and <b>grasserie.</b> Of the two conditions we can speak more definitely in the case of <b>grasserie,</b> because this we have studied quantitatively as well, that is to say, the particles visible microscopically and ultramicroscopically have been counted without bringing to light any marked difference between normal and diseased blood. This leads us to believe that the virus of wilt disease is probably invisible, and the virus of <b>grasserie</b> almost certainly so, when studied with the optical equipment that we have used, and that further evidence will be necessary before one can accept the chlamydozoa or the Borrellina as the active etiological agents. Although these two polyhedral viruses do not appear to be visibly particulate, it does not follow that other alterable viruses are not organized in this way. Each should be considered on its own merits...|$|E

40|$|Indonesian silk farming (Sericulture) has {{experienced}} two waves of a pebrine epidemic (also known as pepper disease) and <b>grasserie.</b> The first pebrine epidemic occurred in 1973 {{and the second}} one occurred in 2010. Natural silk production in Indonesia has undergone dramatic decline after these epidemics. In addition to the disease, other factors also simultaneously contributed to the decline. This research examines the conditions and challenges to national natural silk industry recovery after a pebrine epidemic. The present study employs a survey and focus group discussion in three regencies (Wajo, Soppeng, and Enrekang), {{which took place in}} September 2016. Findings show that there are three major factors which contribute to the decline of national silk production, namely the: i) epidemic of silkworm disease, ii) quality of silkworms and the process of silkworm provision, iii) insufficiency of farmer means of production, and iv) lack of guidance and assistance for the farmers. Without interventions and greater support to properly maintain silkworm operations a potentially lucrative economy for rural farmers could go unrealized. The implications of this research also highlight key potential interventions for working with communities and supporting the overall resilience of national silk production in Indonesia...|$|E

Epidemiological {{study on}} pebrine {{diseases}} and <b>grasserie</b> on several strains and seed {{sources of the}} silkworm using molecular detection methods (supervised by Djamal Sanusi, Tutik Kuswinanti and Andi Nasruddin). This study aims to determine: 1) the morphological characteristics of Nosema bombycis and Bombyx mori Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (BmNPV); 2) the infectivity of N. bombycis and BmNPV; 3) the resistance level of the silkworm strains against the N. bombycis and BmNPV; 4) to investigate {{the relationships between the}} production, pebrin disease with climatic factors; 5) to detect pathogen of N. bombycis and BmNPV by using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methods on the silkworm. The results showed that there were two isolates of Nosema bombycis, PC- 614 and PL- 614. The isolate PC- 614 was originated from imported seeds while PL- 614 was derived from local seeds. Both isolates had identical physical characters with the average of spore length 3, 91 ??m and the width of 2, 01 ??m. the shapes for both isolates were oval while for polyhedra BmNPV was rounded to hexagonal with the average diameter of 3, 59 ??m. The infectivity of PC- 614 and PL- 614 isolates were relativity similar. However, the highest cumulative mortality on instar inoculation 4 th instar was found to be 77...|$|E
40|$|In the {{silkworm}} rearing, {{the usage}} of commercial silkworm hybrids resistant/tolerant to silkworm diseases is economical and better option particularly in tropical countries, where inadequate disinfection methods are practiced. Among the major silkworm diseases, <b>grasserie</b> caused by Bombyx mori Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (BmNPV) is controlled by polygens. In the present study, {{an attempt was made}} to develop BmNPV tolerant polyvoltine x bivoltine hybrids by utilizing newly evolved BmNPV tolerant polyvoltine breeds viz., AKP 1, AKP 2 and AKP 3 as lines and bivoltine breeds viz., AKB 6, AKB 7 and AKB 8 as testers by employing LinexTester analysis. Nine hybrid combinations were compared with the control hybrids viz., Pure MysorexCSR 2 and APM 1 xAPS 8. Total score of positive traits of Specific Combing Ability (SCA), mid Parental Heterosis (MPH) and Better Parent Heterosis (BPH) was observed maximum in case of AKP 1 xAKB 6 with 20 fallowed by AKP 1 xAKB 8 (19), AKP 2 xAKB 7 (13), AKP 3 xAKB 6 (13). Least total score was observed in the case of AKP 1 xAKB 7. Based upon the total scores (SCA, MPH and BPH), over dominance and E. I values, AKP 1 xAKB 6 and AKP 1 xAKB 8 were identified as promising tolerant hybrids against BmNPV with productive merits. These tolerant hybrids can be suggested to the farmers for utilization after conducting large scale trials...|$|E
40|$|In a {{study of}} the effect of polyhedrosis (<b>grasserie)</b> on the {{hemolymph}} transaminases (I) of the developed larvae of B. mori, incubation with isolated polyhedral bodies in place of the hemolymph showed no activities for the glutamate-aspartate, glutamate-alanine, and alanine-aspartate I, even though these I were abnormally high in the hemolymph of grasserie-affected larvae. Of the several amino acids tested for NH 2 -group donor activity to either pyruvate (II) or Î±-ketoglutarate (III), serine, DL-threonine, lysine, and DL-tryptophan did not appear to show any transfer activity to either II or III, while glycine, DL-alanine, and DL-methionine had only a trace amt. of activity towards II and none towards III. Arginine and DL-phenylalanine similarly showed trace amts. of activity only in normal animals, and none in grasserie-affected animals. DL-Isoleucine, on the other hand, showed transfer activities in trace amts. towards III and none towards II. Only the I for the DL-alanine-III and glutamic acid-II, and aspartic acid transamination either with II or III could be measured quant., and significant increase in the activity of each of these enzymes was shown in polyhedrosis. The I for serine-alanine, serine-glutamic acid, threonine-alanine, threonine-glutamic acid, lysine-alanine, lysine-glutamic acid, and tryptophan-alanine, tryptophan-glutamic acid were totally absent. Detectable only in trace amts. in (1) both normal and grasserie-affected individuals were the I for glycine-alanine, valine-alanine, isoleucine-glutamic acid, and methionine-alanine, (2) in normal animals only were the I for arginine-alanine and histidine-glutamic acid, and (3) in grasserie-affected individuals was the I for histidine-alanine. The hypoproteinemia produced by polyhedrosis indicated that the increased concn. of these I might be assocd. with increased protein degradative activity in the host, thus facilitating the production of viral proteins and the multiplication of polyhedral viral particles.
