50|$|The Thunder struck {{first with}} a 12-play, 98-yard drive that was capped off when quarterback Scott Mitchell threw a 10-yard {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver Chris Ford for the only score in the first quarter. In the second quarter, the Surge got into the game with Cary Blanchard's 32-yard field goal. The Thunder's second drive was not as successful as the first, so the team had to punt. Fortunately for Orlando, the Surge's All-World wide receiver Eddie Brown fumbled the punt, allowing the Thunder to recover the ball at Sacramento's 9-yard line. Two plays later, Mitchell threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Willie Davis {{in the back of}} the end zone to increase the lead to 14-3. With the first <b>half</b> <b>winding</b> down and the Surge in a desperate attempt to cut the lead, Archer's pass was intercepted by Thunder cornerback Malcolm Frank at midfield and returned to the Sacramento 9-yard line. However, the Surge defense held its ground and forced the Thunder to settle for a 20-yard field goal by Tracy Bennett. Archer then piloted a quick Sacramento drive that resulted in a 24-yard Blanchard field goal that reduced the Thunder lead to 17-6 at the halftime break.|$|E

50|$|In {{their second}} Big Ten conference matchup of the 2010 season, the #2 ranked Ohio State Buckeyes faced the Indiana Hoosiers. From the {{beginning}} of the game, Ohio State opened up on the run following Terrelle Pryor's injury in the previous game. Dan Herron scored on a 39-yard touchdown run within the first five minutes of the game, which began a first half of many scores for Ohio State. Pryor connected {{with one of the most}} productive quarterback-to-wide receiver combos in 2010 with a touchdown pass to Dane Sanzenbacher. Entering the second quarter, Ohio State led the Indiana Hoosiers 14-0. However, the Buckeyes were not done scoring and quickly scored on Brandon Saine 60-yard touchdown run, and a touchdown pass from Pryor to DeVier Posey. With the seconds in the first <b>half</b> <b>winding</b> down, Ohio State connected on a field goal by Devin Barclay to extend their halftime lead to 31-0. With {{the beginning of}} the second half Ohio State scored after a defensive stop, a touchdown pass to Herron, Ohio State's last score of the day. Indiana overcame the Ohio State defense with the second-string coming into the game. Indiana scored on a field goal late in the third quarter and a touchdown in the fourth. Ohio State won the game 38-10, extending their winning streak and moving to 6-0 (0-0 after victories were vacated). This would have been coach Jim Tressel's 100th win at Ohio State.|$|E
50|$|Delaware {{squared off}} against #1 Richmond on Saturday September 12 {{in front of}} 20,000 plus fans, with the Spiders coming off a big win over the Duke Blue Devils. Delaware's defense opened the scoring by forcing a punt which {{resulted}} in a muffed snap that went over the Richmond punters head in the end zone. The punter kicked the ball {{out of the back of}} the end zone to prevent a Delaware touchdown, and UD took a 2-0 lead. On the ensuing drive the Blue Hens managed to get into field goal range and made the score 5-0. After another UD field goal put them up 8-0, Richmond drove down the field with the <b>half</b> <b>winding</b> down and scored a touchdown to cut the lead to 8-7. After trading defensive stops, UD forced a fumble in the red zone and the offense punched it in for touchdown putting Delaware up 15-7. Richmond was able to drive down the field in the 4th quarter for a touchdown and went for a 2-point conversion to tie it, but the conversion failed and Delaware led 15-13. Richmond again managed to get down the field and the Delaware defense again held them to a field goal, putting Richmond ahead 16-15. After defensive stops by both teams, the Richmond punter muffed a punt that failed to cross the 50. With the excellent field position, Pat Devlin completed a pair of passes to get Delaware to the 12-yard line with under 2 minutes to play. After three straight rushing plays to run time off the clock, UD set up for the field goal with 32 seconds to play. The Richmond defense however was able to block the 29-yard field goal attempt to preserve a close 16-15 win in a hard fought CAA game. The blocked field goal made ESPN's Top Ten Highlights for Saturday as the #2 play of the day.|$|E

After a Dolphins punt,the Pats drove 42 yards to the Dolphins 38, but Brady was intercepted by Jason Trusnik at the 34. The Dolphins drove 60 yards to the Patriots 6, but the red zone defense forced them to kick a 24-yard field goal. After a Patriots punt, the Dolphins drove to their own 45, but Ryan Tannehill was intercepted by Duron Harmon at the Patriots 34 and {{returned}} the ball 60 yards to the Dolphins 8. Three plays later, Shane Vereen ran in a 3-yard touchdown, increasing the lead to 14-3. Jarvis Landry returned the ensuing kick 26 yards to the Dolphins 37. They drove 38 yards to the Patriots 35, but Sturgis kicked a 53-yard field goal. After the next three drives ended in punts, with the first <b>half</b> <b>winding</b> down, Tannehill connected with Wallace on a 32-yard touchdown bomb with 0:05 left to trim the score to 14-13 on a play that was initially ruled a drop. After a decent offensive showing in the first half, the Patriots went on a barrage of scoring in the third quarter. After returning the kickoff 19 yards to the 21, the Patriots stormed 79 yards in just 8 plays, increasing their lead to 21-13 on LeGarrette Blounts 3-yard touchdown run. After a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots drove 47 yards to the Dolphins 17 where Gostkowski drilled a 35-yard for goal, increasing the lead to 24-13. Patrick Chung intercepted a pass on the first play of the next drive and returned it 10 yards to the Dolphins 27. The Patriots cashed it in for a touchdown on the first play with Brady air mailing a 27-yard touchdown strike to Rob Gronkowski, upping the lead to 31-13. After another Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots need just three plays to put the game on ice. First Jonas Gray ran for 6 yards to the Dolphins 41, followed by Brady hooking up with Gronkowski for 35 yards to the Patriots 6. Brady then found Edelman for the 6-yard touchdown pass on the next play, making the score 38-13. The Dolphins drove 65 yards in 14 plays to the Patriots 25, but on 4th-and-18, Daniel Thomas could only gain 10 yards and the Dolphins turned the ball over on downs. The Patriots scored the final points on a 36-yarder, making the score 41-13. The Dolphins turned the ball over on downs and the Patriots took a knee to end the game.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Previous {{studies have}} shown that ENSO’s {{anomalous}} equatorial winds, including the observed southward shift of zonal winds that occurs around the event peak, can be reconstructed with the first two Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) of equatorial region wind stresses. Using a high-resolution ocean general circulation model, we investigate the effect of these two EOFs on changes in warm water volume (WWV), interhemispheric mass transports, and Indonesian Throughflow (ITF). Wind stress anomalies associ-ated with the first EOF produce changes in WWV that are dynamically consistent with the conceptual recharge oscillator paradigm. The ITF is found to heavily damp these WWV changes, reducing their variance by <b>half.</b> <b>Wind</b> stress anomalies associated with the second EOF, which depicts the southward wind shift, are responsible for WWV changes that are of comparable magnitude to those driven by the first mode. The southward wind shift is also responsible {{for the majority of the}} observed interhemispheric upper ocean mass exchanges. These winds transfer mass between the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere during El Ni~no events. Whilst water is transferred in the opposite direction during La Ni~na events, the magnitude of this exchange is roughly half of that seen during El Ni~no events. Thus, the discharging of WWV during El Ni~no events is meridionally asymmetric, while the WWV recharging during a La Ni~na event is largely sym-metric. The inclusion of the southward wind shift is also shown to allow ENSO to exchange mass with much higher latitudes than that allowed by the first EOF alone. 1...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringThe Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) {{process is}} one of the most common and {{economical}} processes which has been adapted by many wind blade manufacturers. The significant advantages for this process primarily owed to its simplicity as well as its lower cost of operation. Nevertheless, there are several potential drawbacks from this process such as the delamination and the dryspot issues. The dryspot issue will be the main focus in this thesis. In this thesis, the methodology includes 3 -D solid modeling, finite element modeling and injection simulations. Throughout the framework of this thesis, 3 -D non-isothermal conditions would be implemented and double core framework will be incorporated within the sectional blade shells. The standard design of the blade is directly adapted from the Wind PACT Blade Designs. [1] The modeling work involves the use of CATIA V 5 CAD modeling software to create a single full <b>half</b> <b>wind</b> blade shell which later sectioned to two sections. The sectional wind blade shells were equally divided right at the mid-span of the full blade namely, the root section and the tip section of the wind blade shells. Finite element modeling was also incorporated through the use of PATRAN 2008 r 2 while the injection simulation is directly simulated through ESI Group of PAM RTM software. The results from the simulation were discussed and analyzed. Post analysis involves recommended solutions toward the issues found throughout the manufacturing process. Future works were also discussed in the final conclusions to provide potential future development study in the VARTM process...|$|R
