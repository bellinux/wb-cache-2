50|$|A {{previous}} successful entrepreneur, Mak Tai Song (Dayo Wong) {{searches for}} his mentor's wife, Sheh Mo Lin (Theresa Lee) and helps pay off her debt because he feels guilty for his mentor's death. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>Tong</b> Kat (Benz Hung) pleads Mak Tai Song to mentor him, hoping to accomplish something for his father's billionaire company. Song ends up mentoring Tong Kat on a part-time basis and take shelves of good wine as payments. Song then gets chase down on making payments for She Mo Lin's debt by Lam Miu Miu (Charmaine Sheh), the debt collection agent of Sheh Mo Lin. The conflicting personalities of Lam Miu Miu, a wild spender and Mak Tai Song, a free-loader, causes many laughing {{moments of the}} drama and in the end, both {{fall in love with}} each other. When Lam Miu Miu thinks things are finally turning out the way she wants, she gets confused by Song's sudden changes and evil-tactics against Ngon Jo Lin (Michael Tse), Song's step-brother. Perhaps Song's long-lost childhood will change him entirely and make him more distant to Lam Miu Miu...|$|E
30|$|It has {{basically}} been considered that only phenolic lignin moieties are oxidized in an oxygen bleaching process, {{and on the}} other hand, non-phenolic analogues are inert. Several oxidation products were isolated and characterized in an oxygen-alkali treatment of simple phenolic lignin model compounds [5, 7]. The number of dioxygen can be calculated to be up to 1.5  molecules to afford 1.0  molecule of the oxidation products. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>Tong</b> et al. [8]. and Imai et al. [9]. showed that about 3  mol of dioxygen are consumed by 1.0  molar equivalent aromatic nucleus in a prolonged oxygen oxidation of kraft and isolated residual lignin samples as well as various lignin model compounds although many of aromatic nuclei in these lignin samples are not phenolic but non-phenolic. These results were considered to suggest that not only phenolic but also non-phenolic lignin moieties are extensively oxidized in an oxygen bleaching process and general reaction products obtained from phenolic lignin moieties are further oxidized. Two possible mechanisms were considered to explain the extensive oxidation of non-phenolic lignin moieties in an oxygen bleaching process: hydroxylation of a non-phenolic aromatic nucleus to convert it to a new phenolic analogue, and cleavage of an aryl ether bond to liberate the aryl portion as the new phenolic aromatic nucleus. The latter mechanism seemed to be more plausible {{on the basis of the}} previous information on the reactivity of AOS [4, 6, 8, 10]. Therefore, the cleavage of an aryl ether bond should be a key in the extensive oxidation of non-phenolic lignin moieties in an oxygen bleaching process.|$|E

40|$|Oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum {{placed in}} {{artificial}} seawater at salinities of 10, 20, and 30 ppt at 10 °C and at 10 ppt at 20 °C were infectious after 12 weeks. Those placed in seawater at 20 ppt and 30 ppt at 20 °C were infectious for 8 and 4 weeks, respectively. These findings suggested that oocysts could survive in estuarine waters {{long enough to}} be removed by filter feeders such as oysters. Thereafter, 30 Eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, were collected with a dredge or with <b>hand</b> <b>tongs</b> at each of six sites within Maryland tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay in May and June and in August and September of 1997. Hemocytes and gill washings from all oysters were examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts by immunofluorescence microscopy utilizing a commercially available kit containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibodies. Giardia was not detected by this method from any of the 360 oysters examined. Presumptive identification of Cryptosporidium oocysts was made in either hemocytes or gill washings of oysters from all six sites both times that surveys were conducted. In addition, during August and September, for each of the six sites, hemocytes from the 30 oysters were pooled and gill washings from the oysters were pooled. Each pool was delivered by gastric intubation to a litter of neonatal mice to produce a bioassay for oocyst infectivity. Intestinal tissue from two of three mice that received gill washings from oysters collected at a site near a large cattle farm and shoreline homes with septic tanks was positive for developmental stages of C. parvum. These findings demonstrate {{for the first time that}} oysters in natural waters harbor infectious C. parvum oocysts and can serve as mechanical vectors of this pathogen...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} three {{experiments to}} investigate the planning and control of remote prehension. Experiment 1 examined the role of visual information of the tool in planning of remote grasping. Results showed {{that the lack of}} visual feedback about the tool reduced the matching accuracy when using a grasper compared to using the hand directly. The grasper used in Experiment 1 had a movable hinge, producing two different length ratios. However, the length ratio did not affect kinematics and matching errors, suggesting that knowledge about tool properties was integrated properly into the motor commands. Kinematics of remote prehension, examined in Experiment 2, showed a longer movement time, longer deceleration phase, and wider peak aperture compared to natural prehension. Results addressed the difficulty of sensorimotor integration in guiding remote prehension. Analyses on angular movements of the upper limb showed tight couplings between joint pairs but coupling patterns were different between natural and remote prehension. The elbow angle range was significant larger in remote prehension but wrist angle range was smaller. The path variability of the reaching limb was significantly smaller in remote than natural prehension. The changes of path variability of the thumb, wrist, and elbow were associated in remote prehension but not in natural prehension. Converging result indicated that the upper limb in remote prehension has less flexibility, especially for the distal portion of the motor effector. In Experiment 3 remote prehension were performed using tongs and forceps with three grasping patterns. The grasp kinematics displayed distinctive features among the <b>hand,</b> <b>tongs</b> and forceps. However, transport did not show differences between the gongs and forceps. Results revealed that the tool had component-specific effects on the motor system; therefore, the control for remote manipulation more likely is a one-time solution, subject to the changes of task constraints and tool properties. This thesis emphasizes the unique aspect in sensorimotor integration of remote prehension and dissects the influence of the tool properties and the hand-tool interactions on the planning and control of remote manipulation. Results provide insights into the design of optimal tools and work environments for remote manipulation...|$|R

40|$|Facebook {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{websites}} in the world with over 600 million users. Those who use Facebook enjoy many benefits. Some college students use Facebook to seek and receive social support when they feel upset and. Toma and Hancock’s recent experiments found when individuals are feeling distressed, they turn to Facebook to feel better. On the other <b>hand,</b> DeAndrea, <b>Tong,</b> and Walther argue that although online interaction provides opportunities for positive social interaction, some users abuse the affordances of social networking sites like Facebook to behave in anti-social ways. They argue that researchers need to move past seeking to determine if computer-mediated communication (CMC) has positive or negative effects as a whole but to determine why people use websites like Facebook in ways that promote or harm interpersonal relationships. This study sought to take a step in that direction by examining one possible predictor of anti-social Facebook use: trait narcissism. The narcissistic personality type will first be briefly explicated. Then the existing research on the relationship between narcissism and Facebook use will be explored to develop hypotheses...|$|R

40|$|Spanish {{speaking}} {{workers are}} the largest population group employed by the food service industry in the U. S., but {{there are very few}} educational programs that address their unique needs for effective learning of food safety best practices. Less than 10 % of Spanish speaking restaurant workers have received formal food safety training. A $ 600, 000 National Integrated Food Safety Initiative Grant was awarded for September 2009 – August 2014 in Minnesota. The ultimate goal of this collaborative research and Extension outreach grant was to significantly enhance food safety best practices by Spanish speaking food service workers using comprehensive educational approaches. These efforts involved design and delivery of hands-on, food safety training in Spanish, at multiple levels in food service establishments and classrooms. The project reached over 1, 350 food workers through 62 on-site restaurant trainings, 25 community meetings and 18 ServSafe® certified food manager and food worker 4 -part course series. Overall, 85 % of participants made positive gains from pre-program to post-program. Participants made statistically significant improvement in <b>hand</b> washing; gloves, <b>tongs</b> or deli sheet use, to minimize bare-hand contact of ready-to-eat foods; cleaning and sanitizing of food contact surfaces.

Fenton finds himself hired to look into Richard's disappearance {{along with the rest}} of his team as an outsider, as the British government can't afford to do so without causing a diplomatic incident with China. Seeking maps of Tibet from his former employee, Yen Wuang, along with his notes on an expedition he took in the area, Fenton encounters his niece, Kim, while searching for them, before being forced to take her with him when the Tong pursue them for the maps and notes. While en route to Tibet, Fenton explains to Kim why he was removed from the army, and why he is heading to Tibet. Before reaching a village on their route, a German fighter plane shoots them down. After recovering from the crash, the pair look to Yen's notes for a safe place to rest from the cold, learning that he had visited the region with a British explorer, a Professor Arthur Hayes, in 1922, seeking a monastery supposed to be a mere myth. Determined to find it but noticing a truck driving through the mountains, the pair discover a German encampment near to the monastery, and rescue Thomas in the process. When the pair make their way into the monastery and the secret chamber within it, Fenton and Kim learn that Richard disappeared through a gate within it, and that to get in themselves, they need a second key that is hidden in another part of the world. Hagenhild, however, captures them both, with plans to pursue Hayes who holds an item that is needed to find the second key on a special map in their possession. Fenton manages to escape, but loses Kim in the process of trying to rescue her, believing her to be dead.|$|R
