40|$|Graduating {{from their}} {{checkered}} histories of financial instability and debt-related problems {{is a key}} policy objective in many emerging market economies. The global financial turmoil that erupted in 2008 {{underscores the importance of}} this issue once again. This article maps out some of the key factors that contribute to this challenge, and then uses this map to develop a possible taxonomy for the array of proposed (and some already existing) policy instruments designed to respond to them. By relating each instrument to the particular aspect(s) of the broader policy challenge, the taxonomy helps to clarify some of the differences, similarities, as well as the potential value-added of these instruments. The analysis herein suggests that instruments that could help increase the efficiency of risk management strategies (such as growth- or GDP-indexed bonds) and enhance the effectiveness of debt management, growth and development policies (such as a stability and social <b>investment</b> <b>facility</b> or SIF) deserve further consideration in order to promote more sustained financial stability and enhanced debt tolerance in the emerging markets.

The attempt to forestall the incidence of insider trading in the Indonesian capital market is by tightening the regulation for the transparency of material information for all companies which want to do their stock transaction in the Indonesian capital market. It is recommended that OJK, which has the authority to determine whether or not a company is qualified to do stock transaction in the Indonesian capital market, be firm and impartial to all companies which want to do their stock transaction in the Indonesian capital market, especially in checking and supervising all material information of the companies which are qualified and healthy to do stock transaction in the Indonesian market...|$|E

40|$|The European Union's (EU) {{trade and}} {{development}} ‘partnership’ with the African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries has long interested scholars of North-South relations. Historically, the theoretical literature on ACP-EU ties has been characterised by liberal institutionalist accounts of interdependence and critical assessments of Europe's neo-colonialism. In the timeframe of the Cotonou Agreement (2000 – 20), this division has expressed itself {{in relation to}} liberal assessments of Europe's pursuit of pro-poor market reforms in the Post-Washington Consensus and critical accounts of Europe's neoliberal ‘development’ agenda. This article argues that a moral political economy offers an innovative lens for the latter critical assessment of ACP-EU ties. With a constructivist focus on Europe's normative ‘development’ agenda, a moral economy standpoint may {{draw attention to the}} EU's role in (re) embedding poverty through recourse to legitimating ethical discourse. This is seen to enable the critical school to more closely consider ideational/discursive power in response to contemporary liberal institutionalist accounts. The article focuses on the European Investment Bank (EIB) and its activities in ACP countries – with particular focus on the Bank's <b>Investment</b> <b>Facility</b> (IF) – as an exemplar of the disjuncture between norms and outcomes.

40|$|A {{number of}} high-debt emerging-market economies face structural, {{long-term}} debt problems {{that tend to}} keep their growth rates low, that impart an unequalizing bias to the growth process, that severely constrain social spending and human development, and that make them vulnerable to capital flow reversals. Unless the nature and pace of growth can be improved in these lower-middle income countries, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) {{are unlikely to be}} met either in many of these countries, or globally. These high-debt emerging-market economies face an impossible choice between draconian and never-ending fiscal austerity, or crisis and a “debt event. ” Both “bitter pills " impose high social and economic costs. This paper proposes the creation of a “Stability and Social <b>Investment</b> <b>Facility</b> ” (SSF) to be housed either at the IMF or the World Bank. It would be a long-term facility to help high-debt emerging market countries cope with and ultimately overcome what will otherwise remain a chronic structural weakness. The SSF would be an instrument providing a steady and predictable source of long-term funds as well as a strong policy signal to help high-debt emerging-market economies reduce their debt burden without having to forgo vital pro-poor social expenditures and growth programs. For the facility to {{have a significant impact on}} debt and income dynamics in the eligible countries, we estimate it would need to lend $ 10 - 2...|$|E

This amount is greater than the dividend and bonus given by Amanah Saham Bumiputera. The KSP usually give the dividend at the rate of 10 percent annually depends on the co-operative stability. More or less this dividends can increase the land's entrepreneur income. Through this study, the researcher tries to discuss the impact of the settlers' involvement in the co-operative activity and its effect on the income increment and income distribution in every selected areas under this study. The researcher also tries to show the relation between the period that land's has been utilized with the percentage given by the cooperative to the land's entrepreneur monthly income. The research also tries to observe whether there is any linkages between land's entrepreneur share in KPF with the monthly income and the period that land's has been utilized.
