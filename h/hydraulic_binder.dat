In this article, the internal moisture of twelve hardened cement pastes fired at high temperature, made with four aluminous <b>hydraulic</b> <b>binders</b> and three different Water/Binder ratios was registered under diverse thermo-hydrous conditions, including at high temperature. The water trapped by physisorption and chemisorption can be significant for some products, and it strongly depends on the mineralogy and porosity of the hardened cement paste.

40|$|Treatment by stabilisation/solidification (S/S) with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>binders</b> {{is often}} {{proposed}} for residual wastes {{that can not}} be destroyed or recycled. Mixing such wastes with cementitious or pozzolanic binders ideally results in a durable monolithic matrix in which pollutants are physically trapped and may have low solubility. Depending on the level of contamination and other waste characteristics that affect the final physical and chemical properties, products resulting from S/S may be suitable for utilisation or disposal. Development of formulations for waste S/S is complicated by potentially detrimental interactions between components of waste and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>binders,</b> and therefore necessitates intensive development in the laboratory.
