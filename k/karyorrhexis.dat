5000|$|Oncosis and {{apoptosis}} {{are distinct}} processes of cellular death. Oncosis {{is characterized by}} cellular swelling caused by a failure in ion pump function.

50|$|After {{the initial}} {{infection}}, the acute phase develops. Clinical signs can occur {{as early as}} 7 hours after infection in some individuals and last for about 4-7 days. Infected shrimp display anorexia, lethargy and erratic swimming behavior. They also present opacification of the tail musculature, soft cuticle and, in naturally occurring infection, a red tail due {{to the expansion of}} the red chromatophores. Mortality during this phase can be as high as 95%. The acute phase is characterized histologically by multifocal areas of nuclear pyknosis/karyorrhexis and numerous cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the cuticular epithelium and the subcutis of the general body surface, all appendages, gills, hindgut, esophagus and stomach. The pyknosis and <b>karyorrhexis</b> give a “buckshot” appearance to the tissue and are considered pathognomonic for the disease. In severe infections the antennal gland tubule epithelium, the hematopoietic tissues and the testis are also affected. This occurs mainly in severe infection following injection of viral particles and has not been reported from naturally infected P. vannamei. Shrimp that survive the acute stage enter a transitional stage.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} {{amitosis}} particularly {{suited to the}} formation of multiple differentiated nuclei in a reasonably short period of time has been shown to occur during the differentiation of fluid-enclosing hemispheres called domes from adherent Ishikawa endometrial monolayer cells during an approximately 20-hour period. (Fleming 1995; Fleming, 1999) Aggregates of nuclei from monolayer syncytia become enveloped in mitochondrial membranes, forming structures (mitonucleons) that become elevated as a result of vacuole formation during the initial 6 hours of differentiation (Fleming 1998; Fleming, 2015a). Over the next 4 or 5 hours, chromatin from these aggregated nuclei becomes increasingly pycnotic, eventually undergoing karyolysis and <b>karyorrhexis</b> in the now-elevated predome structures (Fleming, 2015b). In other systems such changes accompany apoptosis but not in the differentiating Ishikawa cells, where the processes appear to accompany changes in DNA essential for the newly created differentiated dome cells. Finally, the chromatin filaments emerging from these processes form a mass from which dozens of dome nuclei are amitotically generated (Fleming, 2015c)over a period of approximately 3 hours with the apparent involvement of nuclear envelope-limited sheets.|$|E

Objective: The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze the {{frequency}} of micronuclei and some nuclear alterations in epithelial cells of crack cocaine users. Methods: Oral smears were collected from clinically normal-appearing buccal mucosa exfoliative cytology of 30 individuals (15 crack cocaine users and 15 controls). Results: Crack cocaine users consumed about 3. 8 grams per day and the time consumption of the drug was of 6. 4 (+ 3. 3) years. The prevalence of micronuclei, binucleated cells, broken egg cells, budding cells, picnosis, karyolysis, and <b>karyorrhexis</b> was determined. The frequencies of micronuclei for case and control groups were, respectively, 2. 87 + 3. 46 and 0. 57 + 1. 6 (p= 0. 018). No statistical difference was observed for binucleated cells, broken egg cells, budding cells, picnosis, and karyolysis. The frequency of <b>karyorrhexis</b> was significantly increased on crack cocaine users than controls (54. 07 + 38. 58 and 24. 87 + 23. 97, p= 0. 001). Conclusion: Smoke crack might have a cytotoxic and genotoxic effects to the oral mucosa due to increased frequency of micronuclei and <b>karyorrhexis.</b> Thus, individuals who used crack cocaine in the long term need to be frequently examined in order to prevent neoplastic transformation.

Materials and Methods: We included 50 healthy individuals advised for digital panoramic radiography for diagnostic purpose were included in this study. Demographic data and personal history of all subjects were recorded in a proforma before the examination. Gingival epithelial cells were obtained by gentle scraping with a modified cytobrush immediately before X-ray exposure and 10 ± 2 days later. Cytological preparations were stained according to the Feulgen/fast green method and analyzed under a light microscope.

Results: The frequency of formation of micronuclei was not significant with regard to age, gender and after exposure to digital panoramic radiography (P = 0. 276). However this study showed significant increase in the frequencies of nuclear alterations like <b>karyorrhexis,</b> pyknosis, condensed chromatin, karyolysis and indicative of cell death (P < 0. 001).

Materials and Methods: A total of 49 healthy children were submitted to CBCT or a conventional orthodontic radiographic protocol; they {{were divided into}} two groups based on exam: CBCT (n = 24) and Radiographic Set (n = 25) groups. the micronucleus test in the exfoliated buccal mucosa cells was applied. Results: There was not a statistically significant difference (P >. 05) found between the number of micronucleated buccal mucosa cells (MNC) before and after exposure to radiation in either group, showing that neither group experienced a mutagenic effect. However, radiation did cause other nuclear alterations closely related to cytotoxicity, including <b>karyorrhexis,</b> pyknosis, and karyolysis, in both groups (P <. 05). the CBCT group presented a greater increase in cell death than was noted in the Radiographic Set group (P <. 044). Conclusion: According to the micronucleus test, mutagenicity was not induced by the CBCT or the conventional radiographs, but cytotoxicity was verified after these exams, especially after CBCT.

40|$|Introduction: Formaldehyde is a {{compound}} {{with a wide}} range and is commonly used in anatomy and pathology laboratories. At room temperature is quickly volatilized to a pungent and suffocating gas and its inhalation has been correlated to nuclear alterations in different tissues. We aimed to investigate whether exposure to this compound was correlated with the appearance of cytotoxic and genotoxic features in the nasal epithelial cells of students enrolled in a human anatomy course. Material and Methods: This prospective study collected periodically nasal cells from mucosa of 17 volunteers from two different undergraduate programs with different workloads of practical lessons in an anatomy laboratory, 30 and 90 hours per semester. Cells were staining according to Feulgen method and nuclear morphology was analyzed to detect possible damage. Dunn's post hoc test was used in the statistical analysis. Pearson's correlation was performed for gender, age and questionnaire responses. Results: Epithelial cells showed indicators of cytotoxicity and mutagenicity. Students with a more extensive workload in anatomy laboratory displayed a more severe profile with an increase in <b>karyorrhexis</b> (p 0. 05). Conclusion: Individuals exposed for short periods of time to formaldehyde are subject to the toxic action of this gas. <b>Karyorrhexis</b> was the most frequently observed cytotoxic feature and micronucleus showed an increase between the first time point. The patterns observed between the student's groups suggest a negative effect due to exposure time...|$|E
40|$|Background Despite wide {{use as a}} {{diagnostic}} tool in medical and dental practice, radiography can induce cytotoxic effects and genetic damage. Objective To evaluate DNA damage (micronucleus) and cellular death (pyknosis, karyolysis and <b>karyorrhexis)</b> in exfoliated buccal mucosa cells taken from healthy children following exposure to radiation during dental radiography.

On the other hand, radiation did cause other nuclear alterations closely related to cytotoxicity including <b>karyorrhexis,</b> pyknosis and karyolysis. Conclusion Taken together, these results indicate that panoramic dental radiography might not induce chromosomal damage, but may be cytotoxic. Overall, the results reinforce the importance of evaluating the health side effects of radiography and contribute to the micronucleus database, which will improve our understanding and practice of this methodology in children.

Visceral adipose tissue and intrahepatic triglyceride droplets (macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis) indicated abnormal fat anabolism, which probably resulted from both viral-induced hepatopathy and drug-related toxicity.
