5|$|By January 1957, {{with the}} tests just months away, a {{tentative}} schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was {{too large to}} <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Yellow Sun casing {{that could be used}} by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another £1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Halkett's first {{design was}} a {{collapsible}} and inflatable boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth. When deflated, {{the hull of}} the boat could be worn as a cloak, the oar used as a walking stick, and the sail as an umbrella. This {{was followed by a}} two-man craft that was small enough to <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> knapsack, and when deflated served as a waterproof blanket.|$|E
5|$|Following Oppenheimer's {{reorganization}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, {{the work on the}} uranium gun-type weapon was concentrated in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched uranium could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called Little Boy.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. The concept was pursued so that {{in case of a}} failure to develop a plutonium bomb, it would still be possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted. The simplified weapon was short enough to <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> B-29 bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|Raptor is a steel {{inverted}} {{roller coaster}} designed by Bolliger & Mabillard at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. When built in 1994, it broke many records and held many firsts when it opened. Instead {{of having a}} short layout designed to <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> compact area like , Raptor was designed with a larger, 3,790-foot (1,160m) layout, making it the tallest, fastest and longest inverted roller coaster in the world when it opened. It features six inversions, including a cobra roll, a first for inverted roller coasters. At its opening, {{it was the largest}} investment in Cedar Point history. The ride is themed as a bird of prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} prisoners were {{distinguishable}} by triangular pieces of cloth, called Winkel, sewn onto on their jackets below their prisoner number. Political prisoners had a red triangle, Jehovah's Witnesses had purple, criminals had green, and so on. The nationality of the inmate was indicated by a letter stitched onto the Winkel. Jews had a yellow triangle, overlaid {{by a second}} Winkel if they also <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> second category. Uniquely at Auschwitz, prisoners were tattooed with their prisoner number, on the chest for Soviet prisoners of war and on the left arm for civilians.|$|E

5|$|As the 16th century progressed, keeps {{fell out}} of fashion once again. In England, the {{gatehouse}} also began to supplant the keep as the key focus for a new castle development. By the 15th century, it was increasingly unusual for a lord to build both a keep and a large gatehouse at the same castle, and by the early 16th century, the gatehouse had easily overtaken the keep as the more fashionable feature: indeed, almost no new keeps were built in England after this period. The classical Palladian style began to dominate European architecture during the 17th century, causing a further {{move away from the}} use of keeps. Buildings in this style usually required considerable space for the enfiladed formal rooms that became essential for modern palaces {{by the middle of the}} century, and this style was impossible to <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> traditional keep. The keep at Bolsover Castle in England was one of the few to be built as part of a Palladian design.|$|E
5|$|Having {{decided on}} a {{location}} and date, there still remained the matter {{of what would be}} tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group would have to produce the assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for dropping. The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. The designs were frozen in July. Green Bamboo was also nominally frozen, but tinkering with the design continued. On 3 September, Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite. By January 1957, with the tests just months away, a tentative schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was too large to <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another ₤1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|In {{the uniform}} cost model (suitable for {{analyzing}} {{the complexity of}} gcd calculation on numbers that <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> single machine word), {{each step of the}} algorithm takes constant time, and Lamé's analysis implies that the total running time is also O(h). However, in a model of computation suitable for computation with larger numbers, the computational expense of a single remainder computation in the algorithm can be as large as O(h2). In this case the total time for all of the steps of the algorithm can be analyzed using a telescoping series, showing that it is also O(h2). Modern algorithmic techniques based on the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm for fast integer multiplication can be used to speed this up, leading to quasilinear algorithms for the GCD.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{all have the}} same crystal {{structure}} (body-centred cubic) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water: in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature.|$|E
