30|$|<b>Fluents</b> {{describing}} {{the facts of}} a state. There {{are two types of}} fluents: relational <b>fluents</b> and functional <b>fluents.</b> Relational <b>fluents</b> are symbols of predicates which take a term of type situation as the last argument, which their truth values may vary from one situation to another. For example, inConsultation(Mary, s), means that Mary is in consultation at situation s. Functional <b>fluents</b> are denoted by function symbols that take a situation as the last argument, which the truth of their function values changes from one situation to another. For example, heartbeat(Mary, s) denotes the number of heartbeats of Mary in situation s.|$|R

40|$|Although {{the use of}} metric <b>fluents</b> is {{fundamental}} to many practical planning problems, the study of heuristics to support fully automated planners working with these <b>fluents</b> remains relatively unexplored. The most widely used heuristic is the relaxation of metric <b>fluents</b> into interval-valued variables — an idea first proposed a decade ago. Other heuristics depend on domain encodings that supply additional information about <b>fluents,</b> such as capacity constraints or other resource-related annotations. A particular challenge to these approaches is in handling interactions between metric <b>fluents</b> that represent exchange, such as the transformation of quantities of raw materials into quantities of processed goods, or trading of money for materials. The usual relaxation of metric <b>fluents</b> is often very poor in these situations, since it does not recognise that resources, once spent, are no longer available to be spent again. We present a heuristic for numeric planning problems building on the propositional relaxed planning graph, but using a mathematical program for numeric reasoning. We define a class of producer–consumer planning problems and demonstrate how the numeri...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an augmented situation calculus-based approach to model autonomous computing paradigm in ubiquitous information services. To make it practical for commercial development {{and easier to}} support autonomous paradigm imposed by ubiquitous information services, we made improvements based on Reiter's standard situation calculus. First we explore the inherent relationship between <b>fluents</b> and evolution: since not all <b>fluents</b> contribute to systems' evolution and some <b>fluents</b> {{can be derived from}} some others, we define those <b>fluents</b> that are sufficient and necessary to determine evolutional potential as decisive <b>fluents,</b> and then we prove that their successor states wrt to deterministic complex actions satisfy Markov property. Then, within the calculus framework we build, we introduce validity theory to model the autonomous services with application-specific validity requirements, including: validity <b>fluents</b> to axiomatize validity requirements, heuristic multiple alternative service choices ranging from complete acceptance, partial acceptance, to complete rejection, and validity-ensured policy to comprise such alternative service choices into organic, autonomously-computable services. Our approach is demonstrated by a ubiquitous calendaring service, ACS, throughout the paper...|$|R

40|$|We present work on linking {{events and}} <b>fluents</b> (i. e., {{relations}} that hold for certain periods of time) to temporal information in text, {{which is an}} important enabler for many applications such as timelines and reasoning. Previous research has mainly focused on temporal links for events, and we extend that work to include <b>fluents</b> as well, presenting a common methodology for linking both events and relations to timestamps within the same sentence. Our approach combines tree kernels with classical feature-based learning to exploit context and achieves competitive F 1 -scores on event-time linking, and comparable F 1 scores for <b>fluents.</b> Our best systems achieve F 1 -scores of 0. 76 on events and 0. 72 on <b>fluents.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Time is {{fundamental}} in representing and reasoning about a changing world. A proper temporal representation requires characterizing two notions: (1) time itself, and (2) temporal incidence, i. e. the domainindependent properties for the truth-value of <b>fluents</b> and events throughout time. Their formal definition involves some controversial {{issues such as}} (i) the expression of instantaneous events and <b>fluents</b> that hold instantaneously, (ii) the dividing instant problem and (iii) the formalization of the properties for non-instantaneous holding of <b>fluents.</b> This paper discusses how previous attempts fail to address all these issues and presents simple yet satisfactory theories of time and temporal incidence. The theory of time, called IP, is based on having instants and periods at the same ontological level. The theory of temporal incidence is defined upon IP and its key insight is the distinction between continuous and discrete <b>fluents.</b> 1 Introduction Time has been recognized as a fundamen [...] ...|$|R
