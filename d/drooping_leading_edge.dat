40|$|Helicopters in {{high-speed}} {{forward flight}} usually experience large regions of dynamic stall over the retreating {{side of the}} rotor disk. The rapid variations in the lift and pitching moments associated with the stall process can result in vibratory loads, and can cause fatigue and failure of pitch links. In some instances, the large time lag between the aerodynamic forces and the blade motion can trigger stall flutter. A number of techniques for the alleviation of dynamic stall have been proposed and studied by researchers. Passive and active control techniques have both been explored. Passive techniques {{include the use of}} high solidity rotors that reduce the lift coefficients of individual blades, <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> slots and <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> slats. Active control techniques include steady and unsteady blowing, and dynamically deformable <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> (DDLE) airfoils. Considerable amount of experimental and numerical data has been collected on the effectiveness of these concepts. One concept that has not received as much attention is the drooped-leading edge airfoil idea. It has been observed in wind tunnel studies and flight tests that <b>drooped</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> airfoils can have a milder dynamic stall, with a significantly milder load hysteresis. <b>Drooped</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> airfoils may not, however, be suitable at other conditions, e. g. in hover, or in transonic flow. Work needs to be done on the analysis and design of <b>drooped</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> airfoils for efficient operation in a variety of flight regimes (hover, dynamic stall, and transonic flow). One concept that is worthy of investigation is the dynamically drooping airfoil, where the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shape is changed roughly once-per-rev to mitigate the dynamic stall...|$|R

Several types of stall-control devices including extensible round-nose leading-edge flaps, a leading-edge slat, and a <b>drooped</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> were investigated; partial- and full-span trailing-edge split and double slotted flaps were also tested. In addition, various combinations of the aforementioned leading- and trailing-edge flaps were investigated. The tests covered a range of Reynolds numbers between 2. 00 x 10 (6) and 9. 35 x 10 (6). The wing with or without trailing-edge splity of double slotted flap was longitudinally unstable near maximum lift due to tip stalling. The addition of an outboard half-span leading-edge flap or a leading-edge slat to the plain wing or wing with inboard half-span split flaps eliminated tip stalling and resulted in stable moment variations at the stall. The <b>drooped</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> on the other hand, was only effective when {{used in conjunction with}} an upper-surface fence. The combination of an outboard leading-edge device and inboard half-span double slotted flap resulted in an undesirable loop in the pitching-moment curve near maximum lift in spite of an inboard stall. The loop is attributed to the section characteristics of the double slotted flap.

Therefore, such solutions give reasonable preliminary engineering results for both drooped and undrooped wings in the poststall region. However, as predicted by von Karman, the lifting-line solutions are not unique when sectional negative lift slopes are encountered. In addition, the present numerical results always yield symmetrical lift distributions along the span, in contrast to the asymmetrical solutions observed by Schairer in the late 1930 's.

Airfoil performance data determined for freestream Mach numbers ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 4, at reduced frequencies from 0 to 0. 1, and using unsteady pressure transducer measurements, show that droop reduces the tendency of the airfoil to enter the dynamic stall state. Even when it does, {{the strength of the}} dynamic stall vortex is significantly reduced, which is reflected in the 40 to 50 % smaller negative peak pitching-moment values, with positive damping of the airfoil.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this trade study report is to explore the potential of using Active Flow Control (AFC) for achieving lighter and mechanically simpler high-lift systems for transonic commercial transport aircraft. This assessment was conducted in four steps. First, based on the Common Research Model (CRM) outer mold line (OML) definition, two high-lift concepts were developed. One concept, representative of current production-type commercial transonic transports, features <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> slats and slotted trailing edge flaps with Fowler motion. The other CRM-based design relies on <b>drooped</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> and simply hinged trailing edge flaps for high-lift generation. The relative high-lift performance of these two high-lift CRM variants is established using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions to the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations for steady flow. These CFD assessments identify the high-lift performance {{that needs to be}} recovered through AFC to have the CRM variant with the lighter and mechanically simpler high-lift system match the performance of the conventional high-lift system. Conceptual design integration studies for the AFC-enhanced high-lift systems were conducted with a NASA Environmentally Responsible Aircraft (ERA) reference configuration, the so-called ERA- 0003 concept. These design trades identify AFC performance targets that need to be met to produce economically feasible ERA- 0003 -like concepts with lighter and mechanically simpler high-lift designs that match the performance of conventional high-lift systems.

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] variable <b>droop</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> (VDLE) airfoil was successfully used to control compressible dynamic stall and its associated adverse pitching moment variations. But, the price for this success was a 10 % loss of lift. A Gurney flap was then attached normally to the airfoil pressure surface at its trailing edge to recover this “lost-lift”. Gurney flaps are seldom used in compressible flow environment, especially when large angles of attack changes are involved. So, it became necessary to find the optimum flap height that worked satisfactorily for all helicopter retreating blade flow conditions of interest. Parametric experimental studies of airfoil relative performance data with three separate Gurney flaps (0. 01 c– 0. 03 c height) indicated that a 1 %-chord height flap was the most satisfactory. Even though the appropriate Gurney flap height was thus established, a post-experiment analysis of the ensemble averaged airfoil unsteady canonical pressure distributions offered {{an explanation for the}} observed success of the 1 % Gurney flap.
