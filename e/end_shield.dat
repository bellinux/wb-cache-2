2500|$|CANDU's first {{success was}} {{the sale of}} early CANDU designs to India. In 1963, an {{agreement}} was signed for export of a 200 MWe power reactor based [...] on the Douglas Point reactor. The success of the deal led to the 1966 sale of a second reactor of the same design. The first reactor, then known as RAPP-1 for [...] "Rajasthan Atomic Power Project", began operation in 1972. A serious problem with cracking of the reactor's <b>end</b> <b>shield</b> led to the reactor being shut down for long periods, and the reactor was finally downrated to 100 MW. Construction of the RAPP-2 reactor was still underway when India detonated its first atomic bomb in 1974, leading to Canada ending nuclear dealings with the country. Part of the sales agreement was a technology transfer process. When Canada withdrew from development, India continued construction of CANDU-like plants across the country. [...] By 2010, CANDU-based reactors were operational at the following sites: Kaiga (3), Kakrapar (2), Madras (2), Narora (2), Rajasthan (6), and Tarapur (2).|$|E

40|$|AbstractAdvanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) is a 300 MWe {{vertical}} pressure tube type, boiling light water cooled and heavy water moderated reactor. It consists of 452 coolant channels wherein {{the heat of}} nuclear reaction is used to boil the light water coolant to generate steam. Typical coolant channel assembly of AHWR consists of a pressure tube of cold worked Zr- 2. 5 Nb alloy extended by stainless steel end-fittings, attached at its ends. A Calandria tube of annealed Zircaloy- 4 alloy separates the hot pressure tube from the cold heavy water moderator. The Calandria tube is attached at its ends to the Calandria side tube-sheets of both the bottom and top <b>end</b> <b>shields.</b> Thermal expansion, irradiation enhanced axial creep and growth of Calandria tubes cause them to elongate. These elongations induce compressive stresses in Calandria tubes and also load the tube-sheets of the <b>end</b> <b>shields.</b> Stresses also get induced in the annular plate, main-shell and sub-shells of the Calandria vessel. Nature of interaction and types of stresses induced in these components will depend upon the support conditions of both the <b>end</b> <b>shields,</b> creep and growth rates of Calandria tubes. This has been studied for different combinations of fixed and floating types of support conditions of both the top and the bottom <b>end</b> <b>shields.</b> It has been observed that compared to the fixed support condition of both the <b>end</b> <b>shields,</b> stresses induced in the different components reduce to half when either of the <b>end</b> <b>shields</b> support condition is kept floating or on some flexible support...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous PET-MR {{scanners}} {{are being}} developed for whole body imaging. These systems require compact and MR compatible readout for the PET component. Another important modification is the geometry of the PET scanner which is determined by space constraints imposed by the surrounding MR scanner. The maximal radius of the PET scanner is limited and it becomes difficult to insert <b>end</b> <b>shielding.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the effect of modified geometry and reduced shielding on the PET performance with regards to spatial resolution, singles, trues, scatter and random coincidences. Materials and methods: All data were simulated using the GATE Monte Carlo simulation tool. The reference system for the simulation was a state of the art PET-CT scanner (Gemini TF scanner with LYSO crystals Philips Medical systems). This system has a diameter of 90 cm and <b>end</b> <b>shields</b> with an inner diameter of 70 cm. The energy resolution of the system is 12 % and based on this system a whole body PET scanner was designed with less modules positioned at a smaller radius. This modification enables it to fit inside a 3 T MR scanner. This system was simulated without <b>end</b> <b>shielding</b> and with limited <b>end</b> <b>shielding</b> (60 cm diameter). For the three systems the trues, random and scatter were simulated to quantify the effect of the modified geometry. The object used was the 70 cm long NEMA scatter phantom containing activity in a line source at a radial distance of 4. 5 cm. Results: Reducing the diameter from 90 cm to 70 cm results in an increase of the amount of trues by 28 %. The relative scatter fraction increases from 33 % to 36 % for the 70 cm diameter system without <b>end</b> <b>shields.</b> The introduction of short shields resulted in a small reduction (2 %) of scattered and random coincidence fraction. More detailed analysis about origin of the events showed that in the new design 85 % of scattered events originates from inside the FOV, while 90 % of the random coincidences is caused by outside FOV activity. Conclusions: For PET systems with good energy resolution, <b>end</b> <b>shields</b> only play a limited role in the reduction of scatter. The <b>end</b> <b>shields</b> are only blocking a limited part of the scattered outside FOV activity and are mostly effective in reducing the singles and resulting randoms from outside FOV...|$|R

40|$|An Induction motor {{reliability}} survey at an egg {{processing plant}} shows that almost 50 % {{of the total}} motor failures are fan induction motors. Visual investigations of the faulty fan motors show that {{the main cause of}} the induction motor failure is air gap eccentricity. In this study, experimental tests are performed on a 1. 1 kW three-phase induction motor to detect air gap eccentricity and overheating of the induction motor. Heating tests show that <b>end</b> <b>shield</b> housing temperature reaches 100 °C with blocked air flow from the fan, which can reduce the lifespan of the bearing. Dimension measurements of the <b>end</b> <b>shield</b> housing show that the dimensions of both tested motors back-end shields are larger than ISO tolerance grade limit. It leads to a loose fit between the housing and bearing, causing air gap eccentricity. Also, both motor back <b>end</b> <b>shield</b> housing has an out-of-round condition leading to an unbalanced magnetic pull. To detect the air gap eccentricity caused by too loose of a fit between housing bore and bearing, current Park’s vector approach is used. To measure three phase current, Hall Effect current transducers, a digital oscilloscope is used and Matlab software to process the measurement data. Results show that Park’s vector approach can be used to detect the air gap eccentricity caused by too loose a fit between bearing and housing. Therefore, the Park’s vector approach can be used to diagnose air gap eccentricity and analyse the type of the air gap eccentricity...|$|E

40|$|This {{piece of}} {{research}} {{is related to the}} design of large-sized radial flux electric machines. It aims at studying the end-region magnetic field under the steady-state operation in order for an analysis of some important electromagnetic and mechanical phenomena that require careful thought during the design of the end region. The research work is focused on the end region of two large-sized three-phase squirrel-cage induction machines. In addition to the end-region magnetic field, the stator end-winding leakage inductance, the eddy currents inside the <b>end</b> <b>shield</b> and the end frame, and the end-winding forces and vibrations are covered. The 3 -D time-harmonic finite element analysis of the above aspects, carried out with a commercial software package, forms {{the main part of the}} research work. The corresponding measurement, as a complement to the finite element analysis, is mainly for validating the models and the numerical calculations. A 3 -D time-harmonic finite element analysis of the end-region magnetic field with suitable boundary conditions can give an accurate distribution of the magnetic field. The stator end-winding leakage only affects the core ends; hence, the end-winding leakage inductance can be calculated from the corresponding magnetic energy separated from the total magnetic energy. The eddy currents inside the <b>end</b> <b>shield</b> and the end frame do not affect the end-region magnetic field seriously, and it is feasible to consider them as surface currents and to model them with the standard impedance boundary condition. The end-winding forces cause vibrations and deformation, but the amplitude of vibration and the degree of deformation are small because of the end-winding bracing system. With the bracing system, the natural frequency of the most excitable mode of the end winding and its bracing system is also greatly raised, so resonances may be avoided. Under the steady-state operation of large-sized induction machines, the end-region magnetic field does not bring about severely disadvantageous electromagnetic and mechanical phenomena in the end region. However, from the viewpoint of optimisation, the end frame can be shifted farther from the end winding for eliminating potential hot spots. In addition, fewer bracing parts can be fixed to the knuckle portion and the lower part of the involute portion of the end connections for improving the cooling of the end region...|$|E

40|$|Axial-flux {{machines}} {{tend to have}} cooling difficulties {{since it}} is difficult to arrange continuous heat path between the stator stack and the frame. One important {{reason for this is that}} no shrink fitting of the stator is possible in an axial-flux machine. Using of liquid-cooled <b>end</b> <b>shields</b> does not alone solve this issue. Cooling of the rotor and the end windings may also be difficult at least in case of two-stator-single-rotor construction where air circulation in the rotor and in the end-winding areas may be difficult to arrange. If the rotor has significant losses air circulation via the rotor and behind the stator yokes should be arranged which, again, weakens the stator cooling. In this paper we study a novel way of using copper bars as extra heat transfer paths between the stator teeth and liquid cooling pools in the <b>end</b> <b>shields.</b> After this the end windings still suffer of low thermal conductivity and means for improving this by high-heat-conductance material was also studied. The design principle of each cooling system is presented in details. Thermal models based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are used to analyse the temperature distribution in the machine. Measurement results are provided from different versions of the machine. The results show that significant improvements in the cooling can be gained by these steps. Post-print / final draf...|$|R

This is then used as a base case in order to investigate the impact configuration changes have on the fluid flow field and heat transfer characteristics in the end region of TEFC induction motors. Common parameters governing the flow field inside the end region are varied, allowing recommendations for improved design and further research recommendations to be made. CFD techniques are successfully applied to model the end region, including the copper where the heat generated is a function of temperature. Through these numerical techniques a good understanding of the flow field was made possible which enabled the author to propose and test configuration changes which improve the heat transfer characteristics in the region.

40|$|In a {{pressurized}} {{heavy water}} reactor, following {{loss of the}} primary coolant, severe core damage would begin with the depletion of the liquid moderator, exposing the top row of internally-voided fuel channels to steam cooling conditions {{on the inside and}} outside. The uncovered fuel channels would heat up, deform and disassemble into core debris. Large inventories of water passively reduce the rate of progression of the accident, prolonging the time for complete loss of engineered heat sinks. The efficacy of available backup and ultimate heat sinks, available in a CANDU 6 reactor, in mitigating the consequences of a prolonged station blackout scenario was analysed using the MAAP 4 -CANDU code. The analysis indicated that the steam generator secondary side water inventory is the most effective heat sink during the accident.
