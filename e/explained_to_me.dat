500|$|Lauren London as New New/Erin Garnett, Rashad's love {{interest}} and John Garnett's daughter. The character of New-New was {{loosely based on}} R group TLC's [...] "T-Boz as a kid," [...] said London. [...] "I talked to her about my character... she <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> how it was when she was young— the attitude and the flavor. And it’s funny, {{a lot of people}} say that I act like she used to act at the skating rink.” Director Robinson was impressed by London and [...] "everything from her look, to the fact that she's new. And there's just so much truth in her, and she doesn't know how to lie yet as an actress. It was perfect." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an unconstitutional}} though {{widespread}} practice during the Communist witchhunts, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen's passport. This, and {{his inability to}} find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he named 57 people as Communists. [...] He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: [...] "I don't think, {{after two years of}} thinking, that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation." [...] Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father's decision: [...] "It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn't know what to do. What I think he wanted to know was, what would I think of him if he talked? He didn't say it in that way, though. Then he <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time, from my point of view. What could any kid say at that point? You say, 'I love you and I'm behind you.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Distilling what sports {{had done}} {{right into a}} recipe for {{engaging}} young people, Kamen says, {{turned out to be}} relatively straightforward. [...] "It's after school, not in school. It's aspirational, not required," [...] he <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Irving {{nonetheless}} {{worked the}} secret material into his book, writing an entire chapter about Enigma {{in the first}} draft of The Mare's Nest. When it {{came to the attention of}} the authorities, [...] "one night I was visited at my flat by men in belted raincoats who came and physically seized the chapter. I was summoned to the Cabinet Office, twelve men sitting around a polished table, where it was <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> why [...] was not being released and we appeal to you as an English gentleman not to release [...]" [...] Irving cooperated and withdrew the chapter, but by this time he had copied enough material from Cherwell's archive to furnish several more books. ULTRA remained secret for another decade.|$|E
2500|$|Mourners {{packed the}} Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church on January 2, 2007, to pay final respects. Monsignor Stanley Sliwiak officiated {{at the funeral}} mass. In a eulogy, Treviño's son, David Vidal Treviño, Sr. (born 1958), said that his father taught him that [...] "the only {{requirement}} in overcoming professional jealousy was in doing the very best {{you know how to}} do." [...] David Treviño added that his father [...] "made hard decisions and embodied the true spirit of leadership. His style pushed everyone to do more, to excel, and to do it better." [...] He went on to add that [...] "when someone had something unkind or false to say about Dad, I argued with him that he needed to respond because in the absence of truth, people might believe the lies that were being said about him. [...] But he chose to keep quiet and <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that he had lived his life in such a manner so that anyone who really knew him would not believe it." [...] About politics, David Treviño mentioned that his father [...] "didn’t regret political differences with those friends he respected, but he did regret that their philosophies sometimes kept them apart." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a December 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, guest star Dylan McDermott spoke {{about being in}} the second season of American Horror Story, [...] "I loved doing the show. It's like being home for me. We talked about it I think early in the season. He [...] called me over the summer and {{we were trying to}} figure out what was the best plan and in what capacity. I wasn't sure myself and obviously he's the master and the genius that figures this shit out. So the day the show premiered he called me and he explained it to me because I hadn't read any of the scripts. He <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> what my character was going to be and I was like, 'Are you fucking kidding me? I love this! I love this! It's beyond!' To play the modern day Bloody Face and to have this whole back story of a guy who's thrown away and aborted and still lived! It was just like, are you kidding me? It was music to my ears, maybe nobody else's. But to me? I couldn't believe it. It's so twisted and dark and fucked up. That's why I'm on the show because I love stuff like that." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea for}} Pan's Labyrinth came from Guillermo del Toro's notebooks, {{which he says}} are filled with [...] "doodles, ideas, {{drawings}} and plot bits". He had been keeping these notebooks for twenty years. At one point during production, he left the notebook in a taxi in London and was distraught, but the cabbie returned it to him two days later. Though he originally wrote {{a story about a}} pregnant woman who {{falls in love with a}} faun, Sergi López said that del Toro described the final version of the plot a year and a half before filming. Lopez said that [...] "for two hours and a half he <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> all the movie, but with all the details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written'". López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he said that [...] "it was exactly the same, it was incredible. In his little head he had all the history with a lot of little detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head".|$|E
2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E
2500|$|Associate Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point G. Christopher Williams {{discussed}} {{the relationship between}} GLaDOS and Chell. In response to a quote by designer Erik Wolpaw that read [...] "we wanted you to have this very intimate connection with this AI that changes and evolves over time, {{leading up to the}} point that you betray her and do the most intimate act you can do with someone—murdering them in cold blood", he at first noted that [...] "on the face of it, this description of intimacy seems nonsensical", but also noted that [...] "a changing and evolving relationship with someone in authority over you that eventually leads to betraying them by violating their rules—is one that is an altogether familiar one". He used the parent-child relationship as an example of this and cited a metaphor by psychologist Sigmund Freud which Williams said was about [...] "murdering a parent in an effort to describe how children eventually would attempt to get out from under the wing of their parents". He wrote [...] "nothing can be as intimate, perhaps, as loving someone enough to follow their rules and then needing to “kill them” in order to escape that “game,” which makes this game feel like something more like a really familiar relationship". He called her [...] "just one of many countless authorities that have <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the rules of a game, how to control myself, and then pushed me towards a particular goal of the computer’s design" [...] and that [...] "this is an experience that I have every time that I fire up my Xbox and describes the curiously intimate relationship between player and gaming system that emerges in single player gameplay". He further discussed that he had no idea that Chell's name was Chell or that she was a female because he recognized the character as himself. He wrote [...] "I cared about GlaDOS only because she was the one directing me. Oh, and then I really cared about her because she wanted to kill me".|$|E
