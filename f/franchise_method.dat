40|$|Most of {{the thesis}} will {{concentrate}} on the two jurisdictions in which the <b>franchise</b> <b>method</b> is already well established, the European Economic Community (EEC) and the United States (US). The first chapter of this thesis is a general introduction to the <b>franchise</b> <b>method</b> and its main characteristics and features. Also included, is {{an introduction to the}} different types of franchise specific legislation. In the second chapter, the development of the approach taken towards the <b>franchise</b> <b>method</b> in the EEC is examined. The chapter includes an analysis of the Court of Justice's (COJ) well-known Pronuptia judgment, the EEC individual exemptions for franchise agreements issued by the EEC Commission and the Commission's franchise regulation. The first part of the third chapter, deals with the antitrust law in the US to the extent it concerns franchise agreements. The second part of the third chapter examines franchise legislation to protect franchises in the US, both at the federal and at the state level. The study in both parts of the third chapter is done through concentrating in the status of territorial exclusivity. The fourth and last chapter presents broad comparisons and general conclusions.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the 1993 Railways Act, the British {{railways}} industry was privatised which resulted in the separation of ownership and control of the railway infrastructure (track, signals and stations) from that of passenger train operations. The Great North Eastern Railway (GNER), a major train operator, was unable to meet its contractual obligations shortly after successfully re-tendering for its second franchise. Within the context of incomplete contract theory, this paper discusses the main problems inherent in the franchising process and which specifically contributed to the collapse of GNER. In particular, the paper argues that the fragmented structure of asset ownership, the lack of coordination and investment incentives and flaws in the <b>franchise</b> <b>method</b> itself explain the demise of GNER and have undermined the general objectives of railway privatisation...|$|E

40|$|Background: It can be {{observed}} recently, that the sector of educational services is seen to have potential {{of changes in the}} system of the higher education. The problems of this area are more and more visible ones along with the growth of its competitiveness, which are a consequence of demographic changes and the maladjustment of an educational offer to the need of the labor market. Therefore, the tendency to the concentration seems to be more and more distinct and fully justified one, especially for private universities. The franchising seems to be a mechanism, which is most predestined for this type of actions covering the area of educational services. The essence and the possibilities of the implementation of <b>franchising</b> <b>methods</b> are presented in this paper. The process of creation of a franchising system and factors determining its choice as well as the mechanism of its implementation in the education were described. 	Methods: The paper is based on the analysis of literature sources and indicates the possibility to use the potential of franchising in the management of a university. The attempt was made to present this problem in the context of a franchisor and a franchisee as well as possible market changes. 	Results and conclusions: The paper is a study of the literature and uses the experiences of the implementation of franchising in various services areas. Its purposefulness as well as the possibilities of its application in higher education was shown. The lack of results of researches in this area makes impossible to precise the system and the scope of its implementation. The need of such researches was shown as well as the need of preparing a report showing the existing facts and possibilities to use <b>franchising</b> <b>methods</b> in this area...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the factors that motivate {{international}} retail companies to choose <b>franchising</b> as a <b>method</b> for entering international markets. Employs a qualitative methodology and a multiple case study design. Six major UK-based international fashion retailers form the empirical basis for the work. Finds the motivating influences to be a combination of both organisational and environmental factors. International retailing experience, availability of financial resources, presence of a franchisable retail brand, company restructuring and influence of key managers emerge as the organisational factors while environmental influences are revealed as opportunistic approaches, local market complexities, domestic competitive pressures and availability of potential franchise partners. Provides a useful source of information for those retail firms considering internationalization via the <b>franchising</b> <b>method.</b> Research is made all the more pertinent by the fact that retail service firms do not necessarily have franchising experience in the domestic market before they adopt franchising in the international environment. While findings are particular to retail firms they could also have relevance for other service sectors. Addresses a gap in international franchising literature by examining the factors that motivate retail firms to internationalise via franchising. As such, the paper contributes to academic and practitioner understanding of the international retail franchise process...|$|R

However, evidence is scarce regarding how franchises should be operated to actualize such results. This paper {{aimed to explore}} the association between the results achieved by healthcare franchises and the working relationships among actors in these <b>franchises.</b> <b>Methods</b> A sequential mixed methods approach was used to obtain both in-depth and broader quantifiable insights into a little-investigated phenomenon. We first employed a qualitative multiple embedded case study. Data were collected through observations, document analyses, and 96 in-depth semi-structured interviews in three Dutch healthcare franchises. Withincase and cross-case comparative analyses were conducted. Subsequently, a crosssectional survey was developed based on the qualitative study and disseminated among 19 healthcare franchises. 40 franchisors and 346 unit actors filled in the questionnaire.

This study sought to determine the critical success factors for a franchised restaurant system entering the Kenyan market. It sought to ‘establish how franchisors and franchisees define, identify and evaluate success’. It also sought ‘to determine what makes a franchise successful from the customers’ perspective. This study has provided a theoretical framework that helps to understand the background of why organizations seek to expand using <b>franchising</b> <b>method</b> and consequently the critical success factors for franchised restaurants entering the Kenyan market. The study used qualitative methodology in establishing the views of franchisors and franchisees with the use of in-depth interviews. In keeping with research trends this study also used triangulation of methodology. We did an exploratory study using focus group discussions to explore the views of customers on franchised restaurants. Thereafter we carried out a survey to verify the hypotheses developed for the study in this way using triangulation of methodology and arriving at a better understanding of the issues under study. This was followed by analysis of the qualitative data and the quantitative data separately. The results yielded critical success factors from the franchisors perspective, franchisees perspective and the customers’ perspective. The critical success factors from the franchisors point of view included a clear concept, distance management, cultural appeal, excellent selection of franchisees, good site/location selection, and good relationship with the franchisees and reasonable franchise contractual terms. The critical success factors from the franchisees point of view were good relationship with the franchisor, good financial management, relationship marketing, good staff management, competent staff, and unique value proposition for the customer, attractive atmosphere, convenient location and speed of service. The customers’ perspective included good and consistent products and product range (menu mix), competent staff who were clean, warm, courteous and welcoming, a pleasant and clean atmosphere, reasonable and stable prices and a convenient location with efficient service. Finally the study proposed a prioritization of critical success factors from the customers’ perspective. These findings can be used by restaurant franchises that seek to establish successful businesses in the Kenyan market and other similar regional markets.

30|$|In franchising, {{agency costs}} are {{associated}} with monitoring costs (Brickley & Dark, 1987; Lafontaine, 1992). Since the employees that are assigned are not residual claimants, the franchisor has to put extra effort into monitoring, ensuring that the unit is optimally operated. Thus, this cost is correlated with the distance from headquarters and also the dispersion of the unit (Brickley & Dark, 1987; Norton, 1988; Rubin, 1978). Therefore, choosing a <b>franchise</b> as a <b>method</b> of expansion, the franchisor can reduce or eliminate these agency costs, leading to greater profits if the monitoring of the unit is costly (Scott, 1995).

In the first part, this paper exposes the evolution of researchers' state of mind from the way of thinking which considers franchising and ownership as substitutable organizational forms to theories which analyze the utilization of both franchise and company arrangements. The paper describes the main attempts to explain theoretically the superiority of plural forms. In the second part, the paper discusses the hypothesis which says that there is a relationship between the organizational form of the chain and its efficiency score. It is demonstrated through the application of a data envelopment analysis method on French hotel chains that plural form networks are in average more efficient than strictly franchised and wholly owned chains. The Kruskal-Wallis test which is a distribution-free rank-order statistic is used to statistically verify this relationship.

40|$|Abstract Background Developing {{effective}} {{methods for}} measuring the health impact of social franchising programs is vital for demonstrating {{the value of this}} innovative service delivery model, particularly given its rapid expansion worldwide. Currently, these programs define success through patient volume and number of outlets, widely acknowledged as poor reflections of true program impact. An existing metric, the disability-adjusted life years averted (DALYs averted), offers promise as a measure of projected impact. Country-specific and service-specific, DALYs averted enables impact comparisons between programs operating in different contexts. This study explores the use of DALYs averted as a social <b>franchise</b> performance metric. <b>Methods</b> Using data collected by the Social Franchising Compendia in 2010 and 2011, we compared franchise performance, analyzing by region and program area. Coefficients produced by Population Services International converted each franchise's service delivery data into DALYs averted. For the 32 networks with two years of data corresponding to these metrics, a paired t-test compared all metrics. Finally, to test data reporting quality, we compared services provided to patient volume. Results Social franchising programs grew considerably from 2010 to 2011, measured by services provided (215 %), patient volume (31 %), and impact (couple-years of protection (CYPs) : 86 % and DALYs averted: 519 %), but not {{by the total number of}} outlets. Non-family planning services increased by 857 %, with diversification centered in Asia and Africa. However, paired t-test comparisons showed no significant increase within the networks, whether categorized as family planning or non-family planning. The ratio of services provided to patient visits yielded considerable range, with one network reporting a ratio of 16, 000 : 1. Conclusion In theory, the DALYs averted metric is a more robust and comprehensive metric for social franchising than current program measures. As social franchising spreads beyond family planning, having a metric that captures the impact of a range of diverse services and allows comparisons will be increasingly important. However, standardizing reporting will be essential to make such comparisons useful. While not widespread, errors in self-reported data appear to have included social marketing distribution data in social franchising reporting, requiring clearer data collection and reporting guidelines. Differences noted above must be interpreted cautiously as a result...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. This study {{intends to}} develop a {{decision}} support tool for new business development units in South African consultancies. These consultancies endeavour to out‐license their technology assets. The enterprise engineering model is examined and the rules and boundaries of the Cartesian space is used to derive further functionality (susceptibility, segmentation and competence) from the various enterprise life cycles as measures for business expansion of knowledge organisations. The reader is presented with an overview of knowledge organisations, more specifically consultancy enterprises and its unique challenges and business models. These firms develop technology for specific market applications {{to assist them in}} solving industry specific problems. These technologies are easily modularised and packaged and can be transferred as technology assets to licensees. The bulk of the dissertation deals with the process phases in externally leveraging technology assets, with a focus on the intelligence phase of this process. The industrial engineering approach provides a suitable mindset for understanding the complexity of global strategy problems. Proposed global strategies are based on combinations of geographic areas that become more desirable over time. Levels of aggregation are defined, and the global eco‐socio‐political and economical systems are further investigated. Approaches to global strategy management are investigated, and the PEST framework is used in its broadest sense to conduct an external environmental analysis. <b>Franchising</b> as a <b>method</b> of out‐licensing is proposed as a mode of entry into foreign markets. The development of a decision support tool is supported by the generic system model and more specifically principles from productivity management. Multiple criteria decision modelling is discussed and efficiency and effectiveness are used as the objective and subjective variables. The Brown‐Gibson model is used to calculate a weighted evaluation, and the countries of the world are ranked according to these outcomes. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted on the weighted evaluations providing the reader with graphs indicating what the long and short term focus of consulting firms should be regarding their out‐licensing endeavours on a macro environmental level.

CanterIn {{the last}} few decades, {{franchising}} has {{become a part of}} everyday life in the United States. Many firms in a variety of industries have adopted <b>franchising</b> as a <b>method</b> of doing business. Despite the importance of franchising, the literature on why firms initially choose to franchise and how franchising affects financial performance has been scant (Combs et al., 2004; Watson et al., 2005). The purposes of this study were 1) to examine how well agency theory, resource scarcity theory, risk-sharing theory, and specific knowledge theory justify the franchising decision, 2) to investigate whether franchising affects restaurant firms' market value and profitability, and 3) to investigate the relationship between the ownership mix, combination of franchised and company-owned outlets, and financial performance. For the statistical analysis, the data were collected from the Standard and Poor's COMPUSTAT database, Bond's Franchise Guide and 10 K reports. A logistic regression model was developed to identify a set of variables that best differentiated firms engaged in franchise contracts from those that were not. The statistical results indicated that: 1) Young and growing firms used franchise more to increase the flow of resources. This result supported resource scarcity theory. 2) The degree of geographic dispersion and involvement in foreign countries increased the probability of a firm's decision to franchise. These results supported agency theory. 3) The decrease of specific knowledge requirements increased the franchising probability. This result supported specific knowledge theory. T-tests and multivariate regression models were used to test how franchising affects firms' financial performance. The findings indicated that 1) franchised firms had better financial performance than non-franchised firms, 2) the relationship between ownership mix and financial performance was curvilinear and the inverted U-shaped relationship suggested the existence of optimal ownership mix that can maximize a firm's financial performance, and 3) ownership mix not only directly affected a firm's intangible assets, but also indirectly affected a firm's intangible assets through advertising. This study found that a purely company owned or a purely franchised chain did not produce the best financial performance. Restaurant companies could use both company-owned and franchised units to leverage the strengths of one another, which will yield a better overall financial performance than if either structure was to operate alone...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of online connectivity {{and a hard}} drive has changed how console games can be marketed and sold, {{as it is now}} possible to patch, update, and publish more content after the game is released. Downloadable add-on content (DLC) is the latest, and still evolving, formatting strategy in the long line of entertainment industry franchising practices. A digital attachment to the physical game copy, DLC is used to guide players to networked service relationships and to uphold these services, while prolonging players’ time with the game through offering more content. Because of its smaller size, DLC is quickly developed and can be used to mitigate financial risk, to bridge the gaps between bigger franchise installments, and to better answer the needs of the fragmented niche markets. In this thesis the benefits and ramifications of DLC, both for the gaming industry and to the player community, are examined. I ask how DLC, as a marketing practice, affects the play and the surrounding culture of console games. More specifically, in what ways does the DLC model affect the ways console games are marketed, and, in what ways does the player community respond to these marketing strategies? The thesis approaches the DLC model through a case study of the skateboarding game Skate 3. The methodological approach consists of a three-fold media industry analysis focusing on 1) cultural production and political economy analysis, 2) cultural texts, and 3) the reception and effects of those texts. These layers are then used as lenses to dissect the respective areas of the DLC model utilized in the case game Skate 3. Tying into each other in surprising depth, the production, distribution, and the textual form of DLC are examined through critical political economy analysis, whereas the player reception is opened by secondary data analysis of user discussions on the gaming forum NeoGAF and on the official Skate blog. Visible within the DLC system is the fact how marketing imperatives have shaped the form of the digital game to better answer their needs. Through leveraging the fragmented form of DLC, options open for controlling both the competition and the player population. As games can be used again after consumption, it is {{in the interests of the}} gaming companies to artificially limit this second-hand access to them. DLC provides a solution to this, as it is bound to the first buyer and cannot be sold forward. To get the “full experience”, second-hand users, too, must pay. Thus DLC can be used for exploiting the power its production structure has over individual. Players are enticed to buy more expensive new game copies, coaxed into service relationships, and leveraged towards other <b>franchises.</b> A central <b>method</b> is to utilize DLC’s fragmented form and use DLC packs for rewarding players when they conform to the marketing plan. The ramifications of the new digital economy come as a surprise to many users. DLC divides the play experience into several pieces, denying the player the “whole experience” unless she buys all the DLC packs. Player groups are forced to buy the same DLC packs to play the same content. As many users still do not have the ability to play or pay online, the online components create haves and have-nots. Players are also forced to gather information about the model on the Internet and left to wonder whether or not DLC even works in certain situations. For many players DLC spoils the customer experience by accruing additional costs over time, making players feel they are charged for content they have already paid for, and by selling a service that simply seizes to function over time. The publisher Electronic Arts contradicts itself by, on the one hand giving an implied promise of a service relationship and basing Skate 3 forcefully on online components, and on the other hand letting its game servers and customer support deteriorate, abruptly disbanding its game service once it seizes to be profitable.
