5|$|Existing {{evidence}} suggests that water fluoridation reduces tooth decay. Consistent evidence also suggests that it causes dental <b>fluorosis,</b> most of which is mild and not usually of aesthetic concern. No clear evidence of other adverse effects exists, though almost all research thereof has been of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|Soluble {{fluorides}} are moderately toxic: 5–10g sodium fluoride, or 32–64mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass, {{represents a}} lethal dose for adults. One-fifth of the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects, and chronic excess consumption {{may lead to}} skeletal <b>fluorosis,</b> which affects millions in Asia and Africa. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines, where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before urinary excretion. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions.|$|E
5|$|Population {{studies from}} the mid-20th century onwards show topical {{fluoride}} reduces dental caries. This was first {{attributed to the}} conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental <b>fluorosis,</b> opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds. The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, foams, and varnishes.|$|E
25|$|Skeletal <b>fluorosis</b> is a bone disease {{caused by}} an {{excessive}} accumulation of fluoride in the bones. In advanced cases, skeletal <b>fluorosis</b> damages bones and joints and is painful.|$|E
25|$|Fluoride can {{be present}} {{naturally}} in water at concentrations well above recommended levels, which can have several long-term adverse effects, including severe dental <b>fluorosis,</b> skeletal <b>fluorosis,</b> and weakened bones. In 1984 the World Health Organization recommended a guideline maximum fluoride value of 1.5mg/L as a {{level at which}} <b>fluorosis</b> should be minimal, reaffirming it in 2006.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluorosis</b> {{leads to}} mottled enamel and occurs from {{overexposure}} to fluoride.|$|E
25|$|Fluoride in {{groundwater}} {{presents a}} public health problem in Jharkhand. A recent survey led by the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi in collaboration with UNICEF in the northwest districts of Palamau and Garhwa found fluoride levels above the drinking WHO drinking water guidelines. Excessive amounts of fluoride in drinking water can lead to dental <b>fluorosis,</b> prevalent bone fractures, and skeletal <b>fluorosis,</b> an irreversible disabling condition. Some work has focused on combating <b>fluorosis</b> through increased calcium intake by consuming local plants. Researchers at Princeton University and the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi are currently investigating defluoridation options, while performing an epidemiological survey to assess the extent of fluoride linked health problems {{and the impact of}} future interventions.|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for dental caries includes dental <b>fluorosis</b> and developmental defects of the tooth including hypomineralization of the tooth and hypoplasia of the tooth.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas that}} have {{naturally}} occurring high levels of fluoride in groundwater which is used for drinking water, both dental and skeletal <b>fluorosis</b> can be prevalent and severe.|$|E
25|$|A small {{eruption}} (VEI 3) {{started on}} 19 May and deposited around 5×107m3 of tephra over the areas west and southwest of Hekla, leading to many cattle deaths, probably mainly from <b>fluorosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some pu'er brick tea {{has been}} found to contain very high levels of fluorine, because it is {{generally}} made from lesser quality older tea leaves and stems, which accumulate fluorine. Its consumption has led to <b>fluorosis</b> (a form of fluoride poisoning that affects the bones and teeth) in areas of high brick tea consumption, such as Tibet.|$|E
25|$|The {{occurrence}} of fluoride is close {{related to the}} abundance and solubility of fluoride-containing minerals such as fluorite (CaF2). Considerably high concentrations of fluoride in groundwater are typically caused {{by a lack of}} calcium in the aquifer. Health problems associated with dental <b>fluorosis</b> may occur when fluoride concentrations in groundwater exceed 1.5mg/l, which is the WHO guideline value since 1984.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{of using}} {{fluoride}} is low {{enough that the}} use of full-strength toothpaste (1350–1500 ppm fluoride) is advised for all ages (although smaller volumes are used for young children; a smear of toothpaste until three years old). A major concern of dental <b>fluorosis</b> is for children under 12 months ingesting excessive fluoride through toothpaste. Nausea and vomiting are also problems which might arise with topical fluoride ingestion.|$|E
25|$|All tea plant tissues {{accumulate}} fluorine to some extent. Tea bricks {{that are}} made from old tea leaves and stems can accumulate large amounts of this element, which can make them unsafe for consumption in large quantities or over prolonged periods. Use of such teas has led to <b>fluorosis,</b> a form of fluoride poisoning that affects the bones and teeth, in areas of high brick tea consumption such as Tibet.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, 70% {{of people}} polled {{in a survey}} {{conducted}} by the American Dental Association (ADA) believed community water should be fluoridated, with 18% disagreeing and the rest undecided. In November 2006, the ADA began recommending to parents that infants from 0 through 12 months of age should have their formula prepared with water that is fluoride-free or contains low levels of fluoride {{to reduce the risk of}} <b>fluorosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Current projects. Projects {{approved}} between 2006 and 2009 {{include the}} Guwahati Water Supply Project (Phases I and II) in Assam, the Kerala Water Supply Project (Phased II and III), the Hogenakkal Water Supply and <b>Fluorosis</b> Mitigation Project (Phases I and II) in Tamil Nadu, the Goa Water Supply and Sewerage Project, the Agra Water Supply Project, the Amritsar Sewerage Project in Punjab, the Orissa Integrated Sanitation Improvement Project, and the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Phase II).|$|E
25|$|The {{eruption}} ceased around 5 April 1846. Initially in this VEI 4 eruption tephra {{was produced}} at 20,000m3·s−1. The tephra deposition (0.17km3) was {{mainly to the}} east-southeast; immediately {{to the east of}} Hekla the layer was 20–40cm deep. Fine ash was carried to the Faroes, Shetland and Orkney. Lava flows to the west and northwest covered an area of 25km2 with 0.63km3 of lava. Large quantities of dark ash were deposited over pasture in the same directions leading to many livestock deaths through <b>fluorosis</b> for the next two years.|$|E
25|$|In April 2015, {{fluoride}} {{levels in}} the United States were lowered {{for the first time}} in 50 years, to the minimum recommended levels of 0.7ppm, because too much fluoride exposure has become a common issue for children teeth, visible in the form of white splotches. The basis were the results of two national surveys (1999–2004 NHANES) which assessed the prevalence of dental <b>fluorosis,</b> and found that two out of five adolescents had tooth streaking or spottiness on their teeth - an increase of mostly very mild or mild forms.|$|E
25|$|Sea ice {{surrounding}} Iceland extended {{for miles}} in every direction, closing harbors to shipping. The population of Iceland fell by half, {{but that may}} have been caused by skeletal <b>fluorosis</b> after the eruption of Laki in 1783. Iceland also suffered failures of cereal crops and people moved away from a grain-based diet. The Norse colonies in Greenland starved and vanished by the early 15th century, as crops failed and livestock could not be maintained through increasingly harsh winters, but Jared Diamond has suggested they had exceeded the agricultural carrying capacity before then. Greenland was largely cut off by ice from 1410 to the 1720s.|$|E
25|$|Dental and {{aluminum}} researchers then moved toward determining a relatively safe level of fluoride {{to be added}} to water supplies. The research had two goals: (1) to warn communities with a high concentration of fluoride of the danger, initiating a reduction of the fluoride levels in order to reduce incidences of <b>fluorosis,</b> and (2) to encourage communities with a low concentration of fluoride in drinking water to add fluoride in order to help prevent tooth decay. By 2006, 69.2% of the U.S. population on public water systems were receiving fluoridated water, amounting to 61.5% of the total U.S. population; 3.0% of the population on public water systems were receiving naturally occurring fluoride.|$|E
25|$|During eruptions of Hekla, {{fluorine}} {{is produced}} and {{sticks to the}} surfaces of the grains of tephra. Fine grains can have a fluorine content of 350ppm, and fluorine poisoning can start in sheep at a diet with fluorine content of 25ppm. At 250ppm, death can occur within a few days. In 1783, 79% of the Icelandic sheep stock were killed, probably {{as a result of}} <b>fluorosis</b> caused by the eruption of Lakagígar. Some of the ash produced in this eruption had a fluorine content of 0.2%, and two days after the eruption contaminated grass had a dry weight content of up to 0.4% fluorine. 450 farms and 95,000 sheep were effected by the eruption. Some sheep were kept inside and fed on hay or moved, but other farmers were forced to graze their flocks outside.|$|E
500|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} {{caused by}} environmental factors during tooth development have long-lasting effects. Enamel and dentin do not regenerate after they mineralize initially. Enamel hypoplasia {{is a condition}} in which the amount of enamel formed is inadequate. This results either in pits and grooves in areas of the tooth or in widespread absence of enamel. Diffuse opacities of enamel does not affect the amount of enamel but changes its appearance. Affected enamel has a different translucency {{than the rest of the}} tooth. Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the translucency decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color. All these may be caused by nutritional factors, an exanthematous disease (chicken pox, congenital syphilis), undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease, hypocalcemia, dental <b>fluorosis,</b> birth injury, preterm birth, infection or trauma from a deciduous tooth. [...] Dental <b>fluorosis</b> is a condition which results from ingesting excessive amounts of fluoride and leads to teeth which are spotted, yellow, brown, black or sometimes pitted. In most cases, the enamel defects caused by celiac disease, which may be the only manifestation of this disease in the absence of any other symptoms or signs, are not recognized and mistakenly attributed to other causes, such as <b>fluorosis.</b> Enamel hypoplasia resulting from syphilis is frequently referred to as Hutchinson's teeth, which is considered one part of Hutchinson's triad. Turner's hypoplasia is a portion of missing or diminished enamel on a permanent tooth usually from a prior infection of a nearby primary tooth. Hypoplasia may also result from antineoplastic therapy.|$|E
500|$|Ingesting ash may {{be harmful}} to livestock, causing {{abrasion}} of the teeth, and in cases of high fluorine content, fluorine poisoning (toxic at levels of >100µg/g) for grazing animals. It is known from the 1783 eruption of Laki in Iceland that fluorine poisoning occurred in humans and livestock {{as a result of}} the chemistry of the ash and gas, which contained high levels of Hydrogen Fluoride. [...] Following the 1995/96 Mount Ruapehu eruptions in New Zealand, two thousand ewes and lambs died after being affected by <b>fluorosis</b> while grazing on land with only 1–3mm of ash fall. Ash ingestion may also cause gastrointestinal blockages. Sheep that ingested ash from the 1991 Mount Hudson volcanic eruption in Chile, suffered from diarrhoea and weakness. The added weight of ash in the wool led to fatigue and sheep could not stand up.|$|E
2500|$|The {{consequences}} for Iceland, {{known as the}} Móðuharðindin [...] "Mist Hardships", were disastrous. An estimated 20–25% of the population died in the famine and fluoride poisoning after the fissure eruptions ensued. Around 80% of sheep, 50% of cattle and 50% of horses died because of dental <b>fluorosis</b> and skeletal <b>fluorosis</b> from the 8million tons of hydrogen fluoride that were released.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{groups of}} people have spoken out against fluoridated {{drinking}} water, for reasons such as the neurotoxicity of fluoride or the damage fluoride can do as <b>fluorosis.</b> <b>Fluorosis</b> is a condition resulting from the overexposure to fluoride, especially {{between the ages of}} 6nbsp&months and 5nbsp&years, and appears as mottled enamel. [...] Consequently, the teeth look unsightly, although the incidence of dental decay in those teeth is very small. Where fluoride is found naturally in high concentrations, filters are often used to decrease the amount of fluoride in water. For this reason, codes have been developed by dental professionals to limit the amount of fluoride a person should take. These codes are supported by the American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry; ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, New Hampshire began {{requiring}} {{public water}} systems that fluoridate to post the following notice in their consumer confidence reports: [...] "Your {{public water supply}} is fluoridated. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if your child {{under the age of}} 6 months is exclusively consuming infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water, there may be an increased chance of dental <b>fluorosis.</b> Consult your child's health care provider for more information." [...] The law was passed with overwhelming majorities in the legislature and took effect August 4.|$|E
2500|$|Fluoride {{ingestion}} {{has been}} noted to delay eruption of teeth {{for as much as}} a year or more from the accepted eruption dates since the initial 1940s fluoridation trials. Researchers theorize that the delay is a manifestation of fluoride's depressing impact on thyroid hormones. The delay in eruption has been suggested as the reason for the apparent difference in decay among the youngest children. Fluoride ingestion during tooth development can lead to a permanent condition known as <b>fluorosis</b> with varying levels of severity, the result of fluoride's interference with the normal osteoblast development.|$|E
2500|$|In cities the {{domestic}} burning of coal {{is no longer}} permitted. In rural areas coal is still permitted {{to be used by}} Chinese households, commonly burned raw in unvented stoves. [...] This fills houses with high levels of toxic metals leading to bad Indoor Air Quality (IAQ). [...] In addition, people eat food cooked over coal fires which contains toxic substances. [...] Toxic substances from coal burning include arsenic, fluorine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and mercury. [...] Health issues are caused which include severe arsenic poisoning, skeletal <b>fluorosis</b> (over 10million people afflicted in China), esophageal and lung cancers, and selenium poisoning.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in other}} aspects of human growth and development, {{nutrition}} {{has an effect on}} the developing tooth. Essential nutrients for a healthy tooth include calcium, phosphorus, and vitamins A, C, and D. Calcium and phosphorus are needed to properly form the hydroxyapatite crystals, and their levels in the blood are maintained by Vitamin D. Vitamin A is necessary for the formation of keratin, as Vitamin C is for collagen. Fluoride, although not a nutrient, is incorporated into the hydroxyapatite crystal of a developing tooth and bones. The dental theory is the low levels of fluoride [...] incorporation and very mild <b>fluorosis</b> makes the tooth more resistant to demineralization and subsequent decay.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, whereas topical fluoride, {{found in}} {{toothpaste}} and mouthwashes, {{does not cause}} <b>fluorosis,</b> its effects are now considered more important than those of systemic fluoride, such as when drinking fluorinated water. [...] However, systemic fluoride works topically as well with fluoride levels in saliva increase also when drinking fluoridated water. Lately, dental professionals are looking for other ways to present fluoride (such as in varnish) or other mineralizing products such as Amorphous calcium phosphate to the community {{in the form of}} topical procedures, either done by professionals or self-administered. Mineralization of the incipient lesion instead of restoration later is a prime goal of most dental professionals.|$|E
2500|$|Community water {{fluoridation}} in the United States is {{partly due to}} the research of Dr. Frederick McKay, who pressed the dental community for an investigation into what was then known as [...] "Colorado Brown Stain." [...] The condition, now known as dental <b>fluorosis,</b> when in its severe form is characterized by cracking and pitting of the teeth. Of 2,945 children examined in 1909 by Dr. McKay, 87.5% had some degree of stain or mottling. [...] All the affected children were from the Pikes Peak region. [...] Despite the negative impact on the physical appearance of their teeth, the children with stained, mottled and pitted teeth also had fewer cavities than other children. [...] McKay brought this to the attention of Greene Vardiman Black, and Black's interest was followed by greater interest within the dental profession.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study of}} varying amounts of {{fluoride}} in water {{was led by}} Dr. H. Trendley Dean, a dental officer of the U.S. Public Health Service. In 1936 and 1937, Dr. Dean and other dentists compared statistics from Amarillo, which had 2.8 – 3.9mg/L fluoride content, and low fluoride Wichita Falls. [...] The data is alleged to show fewer cavities in Amarillo children, but the studies were never published. Dr. Dean's research on the fluoride-dental caries relationship, published in 1942, included 7,000 children from 21 cities in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. [...] The study concluded that the optimal amount of fluoride which minimized the risk of severe <b>fluorosis</b> but had positive benefits for tooth decay was 1mg per day, per adult. [...] Although fluoride is more abundant in the environment today, this was estimated to correlate with the concentration of 1mg/L.|$|E
2500|$|Aswathanarayana's {{exposure}} to the extremely severe human problems endemic in Africa convinced him {{of the need to}} switch to the application of geoscience to human welfare. Using geochemical and isotopic tools, he and his Tanzanian and Finnish associates could identify the pathways of geoenvironment-induced endemicity of diseases, such as [...] <b>fluorosis,</b> stomach cancer and goitre. His most significant contribution to the advancement of science lay in the original way he did high – quality science {{in the process of developing}} paradigms for improving the quality of life of the ordinary people in Africa. Thus, his work entitled [...] "Innovative use of people-participatory technologies for poverty alleviation and improvement of the quality of life in Chamanculo, a slum area near Maputo, Mozambique" [...] has been chosen by the Third World Network of Scientific Organizations (now Consortium on Science, Technology and Innovation for the South), Trieste, Italy and UNDP, New York, as an outstanding example of [...] "Innovation in Development in the Third World".|$|E
5000|$|Dean's <b>fluorosis</b> {{index was}} first {{published}} in 1934 by H. Trendley Dean. The index underwent two changes, appearing in its final form in 1942. An individual's <b>fluorosis</b> score is based on the most severe form of <b>fluorosis</b> found on two or more teeth.|$|E
50|$|Fluoride's {{adverse effects}} depend on total {{fluoride}} dosage from all sources. At the commonly recommended dosage, the only clear adverse effect is dental <b>fluorosis,</b> which {{can alter the}} appearance of children's teeth during tooth development; this is mostly mild and is unlikely to represent any real effect on aesthetic appearance or on public health. In April 2015, recommended fluoride levels in the United States were changed to 0.7 ppm from 0.7-1.2 ppm {{to reduce the risk}} of dental <b>fluorosis.</b> The 2015 Cochrane review estimated that for a ﬂuoride level of 0.7 ppm the percentage of participants with <b>ﬂuorosis</b> of aesthetic concern was approximately 12%. This increases to 40% when considering <b>ﬂuorosis</b> of any level not of aesthetic concern. In the US mild or very mild dental <b>fluorosis</b> has been reported in 20% of the population, moderate <b>fluorosis</b> in 2% and severe <b>fluorosis</b> in less than 1%.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally severe <b>fluorosis</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as enamel hypoplasia, however, hypoplasia does not occur as a result of <b>fluorosis.</b> The pits, bands, and loss of areas of enamel seen in severe <b>fluorosis</b> are the result of damage to the severely hypomineralized, brittle and fragile enamel which occurs after they erupt into the mouth.|$|E
