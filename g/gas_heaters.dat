25|$|It was {{not until}} the 1950s that the {{courthouse}} undertook major renovations. In 1955, the distillate stoves were replaced with butane heaters allowing the chimneys to be reduced to roof level while the roof was also replaced. In 1956, the roof would be replaced again for the fifth or sixth time since the building's completion in 1911. New flooring was installed in the courtroom and some offices, and the courtroom ceiling was lowered for acoustics and heating. In the courtroom, theater-style seating was installed while the upper gallery was removed. A new plywood bench for the judge and a jury box with matching railing were built. The stained glass window behind the judge's bench was boarded and plastered. Downstairs, exterior steel doors were installed, and a counter shelf was built for the office of the sheriff and tax-assessor collector along with five fire extinguishers provided for the premises. In 1957, two <b>gas</b> <b>heaters</b> with electric blowers were installed in the space formerly occupied by the courtroom's upper gallery to heat the courtroom. The building's roof would require replacement in 1974 and again 1975.|$|E

One {{of the problems of}} natural gas pressure reduction stations (City Gate Stations; CGS) is blocking the gas passage due to reduction of temperature in the regulator. In order to prevent this problem, gas is heated in a <b>gas</b> <b>heater</b> before pressure dropping. The <b>gas</b> <b>heater</b> includes, <b>gas</b> passage pipes, intermediate fluid and hot fluid passage pipes. Hot fluid is combustion products of an atmospheric burner and has high thermal energy. Since utilizing of porous media technology has many advantages in combustion systems, the idea of applying this type of burners instead of conventional burners has been widely considered. In this study, replacing of an atmospheric burner with a porous burner in the <b>gas</b> <b>heater</b> of a CGS has been studied numerically. First, by modelling the <b>gas</b> <b>heater</b> with an atmospheric burner, the values of produced heat fluxes at the different equivalence ratios have been studied. The results of these simulations determine the condition which leads to maximum efficiency of combustion in the atmospheric burner. The results indicate that maximum thermal efficiency of the atmospheric burner is obtained in 60 percent of the primary air. In the next step, by modelling the <b>gas</b> <b>heater</b> with a porous burner at various sizes and various equivalence ratios, produced heat fluxes were calculated and compared with those of the atmospheric burner. According to the results, although the <b>gas</b> <b>heater</b> of the pressure reduction station has not been designed for a porous burner, but utilizing a porous burner instead of the atmospheric burner, causes the thermal performance of the heater to increase. The increase of thennal performance at lean equivalence ratios is higher. ej 201...|$|R

40|$|Powders {{intended}} for the use in dry powder inhalers have to fulfill specific product properties, which must be closely controlled {{in order to ensure}} reproducible and efficient dosing. Spray drying is an ideal technique for the preparation of such powders for several reasons. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of spray-drying process parameters on relevant product properties, namely, surface topography, size, breaking strength, and polymorphism of mannitol carrier particles {{intended for}} the use in dry powder inhalers. In order to address this question, a full-factorial design with four factors at two levels was used. The four factors were feed concentration (10 and 20 % [w/wJ), <b>gas</b> <b>heater</b> temperature (170 and 190 °C), feed rate (10 and 20 L/h), and atomizer rotation speed (6, 300 and 8, 100 rpm). The liquid spray was carefully analyzed to better understand the dependence of the particle size of the final product on the former droplet size. High <b>gas</b> <b>heater</b> temperatures and low feed rates, corresponding to high outlet temperatures of the dryer (96 - 98 °C), led to smoother particles with surfaces consisting of smaller crystals compared to those achieved at low outlet temperatures (74 - 75 °C), due to lower <b>gas</b> <b>heater</b> temperatures and higher feed rates. A high solution concentration of the feed also resulted in the formation of comparably rougher surfaces than a low feed concentration. Spray-dried particles showed a volume-weighted mean particle size of 71. 4 - 90. 0 µm and narrow particle size distributions. The mean particle size was influenced by the atomizer rotation speed and feed concentration. Higher rotation speeds and lower feed concentrations resulted in smaller particles. Breaking strength of the dried particles was significantly influenced by <b>gas</b> <b>heater</b> temperature and feed rate. High <b>gas</b> <b>heater</b> temperatures increased the breaking strength, whereas high feed rates decreased it. No influence of the process parameters on the polymorphism was observed.
