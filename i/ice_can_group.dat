40|$|Abstract—Characterizing the {{variability}} in sea ice in the polar regions is fundamental {{to an understanding of}} global climate and the geophysical processes governing climate changes. Sea <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> be <b>grouped</b> into a number of general classes with different characteristics. Multisensor data from NSCAT, ERS- 2, and SSM/I are reconstructed into enhanced resolution imagery for use in ice-type classification. The resulting twelve-dimensional data set is linearly transformed through principal component analysis to reduce data dimensionality and noise levels. An iterative statistical data segmentation algorithm is developed using maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) techniques. For a given ice type, the conditional probability distributions of observed vectors are assumed to be Gaussian. The cluster centroids, covariance matrices, and a priori distributions are estimated from the classification of a previous temporal image set. An initial classification is produced using centroid training data and a weighted nearestneighbor classifier. Though validation is limited, the algorithm results in an ice classification that is judged to be superior to a conventional-means approach.

50|$|Two {{types of}} <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> {{form on the}} Rideau Canal Skateway, which are “white ice” and “clear ice”. White ice has a milky {{appearance}} with air bubbles, and is formed when snow and water mix and then freeze. White <b>ice</b> <b>can</b> also be formed by mechanically flooding the ice surface with water to increase {{the thickness of the}} ice cap. The other type of ice is called “clear ice”, which has a colourless appearance and is formed when ice crystals build up below the frozen surface in cold temperatures. If snow accumulates on the <b>ice</b> it <b>can</b> negatively impact the conditions for skating. Snow depresses the ice surface and slows down the formation of ice crystals beneath the surface.|$|R
