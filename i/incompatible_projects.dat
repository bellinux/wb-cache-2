Secondly, I will detail the {{insufficiency}} of ‘relevance theory’ in defining the content of maxims within the legal context. The accounts of possible maxims’ content in law tend to treat the subject in a strictly Gricean way. They neglect other theories in modern linguistics or philosophy of language. However, it appears that neither of these theories can {{provide us with a}} sufficient vision of legal maxims. Although there exist some similarities between the ordinary and legal speech, I will provide for differences which render them two almost <b>incompatible</b> <b>projects.</b> The relevance-theoretic approach appears only fairly narrowly applicable to the realm of law, as its basic assumption of increasing effect while decreasing effort is a flawed statement in the legal domain. Legislative speech is a collective speech act, while the analytical tools developed in Sperber and Wilson’s theory are designed to explain individual speech. The fact, that an interpretation is easily accessible does not make it automatically more relevant in law. However, intentions are a central notion in the legal discourse. The communicative intention defined by Sperber and Wilson is an adequate reformulation of the legislator’s will to convey a normative content of its propositions. Nevertheless, neither the content of maxims defined by Grice, nor by Sperber and Wilson, provide a fully adequate account of what their content in law could be. There remains a need to search for a more exact theory...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the emergence of}} anti-Japanese resistance movements based on mission schools in Seoul and Pyongyang established by American Northern Presbyterian missionaries in turn-of-the-twentieth-century Korea. It examines how Korean elites from the schools, despite Japanese surveillance, took part in national independence activities by orchestrating diverse systematic anti-Japanese organizations at home and abroad. It is also explored how educational missionaries influenced the formation and development of Koreans’ national consciousness and anticolonial activism, thereby unveiling missionary attitudes toward Korean independence and the Japanese colonial regime. This thesis broadly explores three key issues. Firstly, this research demonstrates the subtle interplay between mission education and socio-political dimensions of Korea in the imperialist milieu of East Asia. This issue pays particular attention to hegemonic contest between American missionaries and Japanese colonialists over mission schools, emerged in the imperialist landscape of Western powers. This study traces how the unique but mutually <b>incompatible</b> <b>projects</b> of evangelization and colonization pursued by missionaries and colonialists respectively encountered in a site of mission education. It {{is also important to}} note the clash between American democratic ideas and Japanese values, each in their own way trying to civilize the Koreans. Secondly, this study illuminates the connection between Koreans’ expectation of mission education amidst foreign imperialist threats to Korea and their collective vision of making a sovereign nation. Especially, pro-Protestant Korean reformers attributed Korea’s inability to check the imperialist intrusion to Confucian civilization and sinocentrism deeply rooted in Korea. Therefore, under an epoch-making slogan of ‘civilization and enlightenment’, the reformers sought modern Western elements derived from mission education in order to protect Korea from imperialism and simultaneously to develop it into a strong ‘civilized’ nation. For them, mission schools were not simply religious institutions for evangelism, but incubators to produce national leaders for Korean independence and restoration of sovereignty by diffusing liberating knowledge and patriotic sentiment throughout Korea. Mission education thus had multiple objectives and roles in a particular historical condition of Korea. Lastly, this thesis considers the anticolonial discourse and praxis of mission-educated Koreans during Japan’s early colonial era of Korea. The modernizing vision of Korean reformers flowed into the curricula and contents of mission education, Korean students imbibing Western concepts such as democracy, equality, and freedom related to Korean nationalism. This intellectual interaction imbued the students with critical consciousness reflecting their colonial reality, leading them to form anti-Japanese organizations intended to subvert the colonial regime. The anticolonial activism of Korean students reinforced the tense interaction between missionaries and colonialists. The principle of political non-interventionism taken by the missionaries crumbled away when the students engaged in anti-Japanese movements, and the missionary involvement in colonial politics resulted in the colonialists’ policies to eliminate missionary power in mission education. Observing the advent of anticolonial activism in mission schools, this research elucidates the unintended missionary links with Korean resistance movements against Japanese colonialism and for Korean independence...|$|E
30|$|A second {{strategy}} for maintaining positive representations of jatropha was to bundle together {{a set of}} expected benefits that were likely <b>incompatible.</b> <b>Project</b> leaders in Mpeketoni talked about {{a large number of}} products that could be made from jatropha (e.g. lamp oil, cooking fuel, electricity, biodiesel for transportation, soap, and carbon credits) when realistically, a project would likely have had to choose between these outputs rather than produce them all simultaneously. As well, several NGO actors spoke about large-scale and small-scale jatropha production being mutually dependent, implying that the pursuit of jatropha in Kenya would automatically achieve both the national economic goals associated with large-scale monoculture production and the poverty alleviation and community development goals associated with small-scale production. Conflating multiple goals in this way gave the impression that jatropha projects were more robust, resilient, and capable of producing more diverse benefits for a broader range of people than they were likely to achieve—and created opportunities to strategically maneuver between discourses depending on the situation.|$|R

40|$|Structured {{around the}} case of South–South {{cooperation}} {{in the construction of}} “complementary economic zones” among the member states of the ALBA-TCP, Petrocaribe, CARICOM and MERCOSUR, this article argues for a socio-spatial approach {{to the study of the}} Latin America–Caribbean integration and development. Two interrelated arguments are developed: first, in contrast to methodologically nationalist approaches, which typically view the regionalisms that are to form the complementary economic zones as ideologically separate, <b>incompatible</b> or conflicting <b>projects,</b> a sociospatial approach in conjunction with a South–South cooperation analytical lens explains their commonality and, subsequently, their interrelatedness and convergence. Second, while this South–South cooperation space is not per se non-capitalist, a socio-spatial analysis also facilitates “seeing” the production of a socialist “counter-space” within this South–South cooperation structure...|$|R
40|$|The article {{portrays the}} results of {{experimental}} studies conducted {{in the field of}} static strength test of main landing gear of lightweight aircraft {{as well as in the}} area of establishing the pneumatic tyre characteristics of main landing gear. The studies were carried out in compliance with methodologies of performing studies for the purposes of solutions implemented in aviation structures. It was stated that static strength tests of landing gear should not be done with the use of shock absorbers, due to the fact that this element, distinguished by high viscoelastic properties, by being statically loaded, is subject to displacements that do not occur during normal operation of the aircraft. Excessive displacements of shock absorber result in the load distribution in other landing gear elements being <b>incompatible</b> with <b>project</b> assumptions, which in turn leads to this strength test being interrupted, bearing in mind significantly lower loads than anticipated. It was also concluded that in order to determine pneumatic tyre characteristics it is not necessary to carry out tests on the whole landing gear strut, because the results obtained in the compression test of the wheel itself with pneumatic tyre are identical as the results acquired during tests conducted in accordance with methodology. Test preparation process with the use of the wheel itself and its realization is less time-consuming, less expensive and does not entail the necessity to build complex test stands...|$|R
40|$|The {{reach and}} impact of {{outsourcing}} is growing fast to include a variety of strategic objectives. Unlike in transactional outsourcing, where the vendor leverages scale economies to provide standardized services at reduced costs of ownership, client satisfaction in strategic outsourcing is contingent {{on the extent to}} which the vendor’ service offering is customized to meet heterogeneous, unique client needs. However, project management practices that lead to high levels of client satisfaction may be <b>incompatible</b> with the <b>project’s</b> financial performance. In this study, we investigate how managerial actions differentially impact project profitability and client satisfaction to elicit trade-offs among these objectives. Using rich field data on 390 strategic outsourcing contracts, we examine the differential impact of output controls, activity controls and capability controls on client satisfaction and contract profitability. We find that activity controls are positively associated with client satisfaction and profitability; in contrast, our results present mixed evidence for capability controls, and negative impact for output controls. In addition to contributing to research in control theory, our results provide actionable insights for vendors into the appropriate strategy and tactics for competing efficiently and effectively in services markets...|$|R
40|$|Systematic {{software}} reuse {{has emerged}} as a promising route to improved software development productivity and quality. Many large corporations have initiated systematic reuse programs, and many reuse frameworks have been developed to guide organizations in these efforts. Yet, in spite of this, systematic reuse in practice has been difficult to achieve. In this paper we argue that a key inhibitor has been the incentive conflict inherent in traditional programs of reuse. We reach this conclusion based on an analysis of interview data gathered from 15 projects across eight different sites in a company once viewed as a leader in the reuse movement. We found that one key contributor to the absence of widespread systematic reuse in this firm was a perception among project teams that reuse was <b>incompatible</b> with prevailing <b>project</b> team priorities and incentives, such as to complete projects on time and within budget. Based on this finding, we undertake a survey of different approaches to establishing reuse described in the literature, and analyze them to determine whether incentive incompatibility is inherent in the nature of software reuse for larger organizations. We conclude that it is not, and provide guidance on how such organizations can design an incentive-compatible program of reuse, i. e., one that generates a climate in which developers and teams view reuse as having a more favorable ``value proposition'' according t...|$|R
40|$|Assessment of Europa's habitability, as an {{overarching}} science goal, will progress via a comprehensive investigation of Europa's subsurface ocean, chemical composition, and internal dynamical processes, The National Research Council's Planetary Decadal Survey placed an extremely high priority on Europa science but {{noted that the}} budget profile for the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (1 EO) mission concept is <b>incompatible</b> with NASA's <b>projected</b> planetary science budget Thus, NASA enlisted a small Europa Science Definition Team (ESDT) to consider more pragmatic Europa mission options, In its preliminary findings (May, 2011), the ESDT embraces a science scope and instrument complement comparable to the science "floor" for JEO, but with a radically different mission implementation. The ESDT is studying a two-element mission architecture, in which two relatively low-cost spacecraft would fulfill the Europa science objectives, An envisioned Europa orbital element would carry {{only a very small}} geophysics payload, addressing those investigations that are best carried out from Europa orbit An envisioned separate multiple Europa flyby element (in orbit about Jupiter) would emphasize remote sensing, This mission architecture would provide for a subset of radiation-shielded instruments (all relatively low mass, power, and data rate) to be delivered into Europa orbit by a modest spacecraft, saving on propellant and other spacecraft resources, More resource-intensive remote sensing instruments would achieve their science objectives through a conservative multiple-flyby approach, that is better situated to handle larger masses and higher data volumes, and which aims to limit radiation exposure, Separation of the payload into two spacecraft elements, phased in time, would permit costs to be spread more uniformly over mUltiple years, avoiding an excessively high peak in the funding profile, Implementation of each spacecraft would be greatly simplified compared to previous Europa mission concepts, minimizing new development while achieving the key Europa science objectives. We will report on the status of this evolving concept, and will solicit community feedback, as we pursue an innovative and low-cost ways to explore Europa and investigate its habitability...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} debates on the {{desirability}} of artificial birth control in Malayalee society, artificial birth control was often opposed {{on the grounds that}} it undercut some of the crucial conditions for the ushering in of full-fledged modernity, which was frequently conceived of in entirely Developmentalist terms. The concern expressed was mainly that it was <b>incompatible</b> with the <b>project</b> of modern self-building, tied as it was to the attainment of a high degree of sexual self- control. However, by the 1960 s, such fears had vanished or become marginal, and now the reverse appeared true, i. e., Family Planning appeared to be part and parcel of disciplined, abstemious and prudent domesticity. The paper tries to explore some aspects of this transformation of associations. Some of the conditions that made this transformation possible had been already taking shape before the full-scale arrival of the Family Planning Programme into Keralam. These included changes in key notions like the nature and social function of sexual desire and activity, modern conjugal marriage and the forces sustaining it, and so on. The Family Planning propaganda of mid 20 th century was bolstered, directly or indirectly, by these ongoing elaborations. Also important was the Family Planning propaganda’s active furthering of the emergent forms of power in modern Malayalee society that were already defining and guiding its modernisation, such as the newer form of patriarchy in which (modern educated) men design and oversee the process of ‘Women’s Liberation’, the new elitism of modern knowledge that marginalises all other ways of knowing and sharply differentiates ‘mental’ work and ‘physical’ labour, the passivising power of reformism which authorises non- reciprocal relations between the reformers and the objects of reform. The overall effort of the paper is to highlight the ambiguities of ‘liberation’ in 20 th century Keralam and to problematise the tradition/modernity binary that too often organises the writing of the history of 20 th century Malayalee society. Key words: natural birth-control, artificial birth control, modern, liberation, modern conjugality, domesticity, sexual self disciplin...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, 2014. It is very obvious that our main concern behind designing this system is the satisfaction of the user. The project {{is to develop a}} system, which uses mobile technology that keeps control of the various electronic devices or product, which executes with respect to the signal sent by mobile. The rapid growth of technology has significantly changed the living standards of modern society. Seeing the rising number of electronic devices being made in a household, an automated home control system has become a mounting helpful trait. Current systems, however, have problems with complexity, high costs, non-open sources and multiple <b>incompatible</b> standards. This <b>project</b> intends to design an open source, reasonably priced and way easy to use home automation system, which will be done by interfacing the open source Arduino microcontroller with laptop; creating a simple, easy-to-use system to manage home appliances. The project was carried out in quite a few stages. The Arduino is first setup for connection and laptop interfacing. Next, the system is made to work with appliances in a home model. Last of all, a simple user interface is created using some user friendly software to make the system user friendly, implementation of the home automation system design. The home automation system design was successfully implemented. Using little software on laptop connection was made to Arduino through wireless network, allowing for control of the appliances in the home model. In this paper we intend to describe a home automation system which uses speech commands uttered by a user to control various home appliances. This proposed system combines both the macros software for speech recognition visual studio and the Arduino micro-controller that is used to provide control signals to the relays, which will control various devices which are part of the home automation system. Nevertheless this project is simple but effective for every user who certainly have just two electronics device the mobile phone and the laptop itself. The rapidly advancing mobile communication technology and the decrease in costs make it possible to incorporate mobile technology into home automation systems. We propose a mobile-based home automation system that consists of a mobile phone with Java capabilities, a cellular modem, and a home server. The home appliances are controlled by the home server, which operates according to the user commands received from the mobile phone via SMS...|$|R
