5|$|Several episodes {{have been}} {{returned}} by private film collectors, who {{at some point}} acquired 16mm film prints intended <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> foreign broadcasters.|$|E
5|$|Attendees include {{artists and}} dealers {{offering}} {{products and services}} <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> fans, and those wish to buy them. Others come for the programming, or to meet friends or other furry fans in general. Many attend {{for all of these}} reasons. Some later publish a con report detailing their experiences.|$|E

50|$|The {{initials}} 'ITC' {{stood for}} two different things: Independent Television Corporation <b>for</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> the Americas, and Incorporated Television Company <b>for</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> {{the rest of}} the world. The American Independent Television Corporation was formed as a joint venture with Jack Wrather in 1958. In September 1958 it purchased Television Programs of America (TPA) for $11,350,000. Wrather sold his shares to Lew Grade {{at the end of the}} decade.|$|R

50|$|On July 10, 2017 {{less than}} a year into the job, Davis Meek laid out a {{strategy}} to acquire cancer, neurological and rare-disease treatments. So Ipsen aims <b>for</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> rise to more than 2.5 billion euros in 2020 from almost 1.7 billion euros last year.|$|R
5|$|Humans {{have kept}} honey bee colonies, {{commonly}} in hives, for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from hives; bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> other beekeepers.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives (CIP) guidelines the 5.7×28mm case can handle up to 345 MPa (50,037 psi) piezo pressure. In CIP-regulated countries every rifle cartridge combination has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum CIP pressure to certify <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> consumers.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Hues {{lived in}} Oxford where he {{discussed}} mathematics and allied subjects with like-minded friends. Cormack states {{he was a}} fellow at the University. Under the terms of the will of Thomas Harriot, who died on 2 July 1621, Hues and Warner were given the responsibility of helping Harriot's executor Nathaniel Torporley to prepare Harriot's mathematical papers for publication. Hues was also required to help price Harriot's books and other possessions <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> the Bodleian Library.|$|E
50|$|UTDC's Can-Car also {{produced}} {{a number of}} other products <b>for</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> the Canadian Forces, including versions of the Volkswagen Iltis, the medium-sized M35 2-1/2 ton cargo truck and the larger Steyr Percheron.|$|R
50|$|A smoothbore {{version was}} also under {{contract}} with the government as a trade rifle, <b>for</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> the Native Americans. The government wanted approximations of long rifles, but did not {{want them to have}} rifled weapons.|$|R
50|$|The sales {{operations}} {{team members}} are often liaisons <b>for</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> {{other parts of}} the organisation such as finance, marketing, legal and IT departments. They will represent the needs of sales in meetings and cross-functional projects.|$|R
5|$|Special coins <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> {{collectors}} {{were struck}} in proof finish through {{the run of}} the Susan B. Anthony dollar, and some minting variations are valuable to collectors. However, most circulation strikes remained in government stockpiles for several years after minting, so many of the coins are available in uncirculated grades, and the premium over face value is minimal.|$|E
5|$|The series proved unpopular in {{everyday}} commerce. Mintage dropped by 90% the following year. From 2002 through 2008, Sacagawea dollars were only struck <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> collectors. The Federal Reserve Bank ordered {{none of the}} Native American series after their issuance beginning in 2009. In December 2009, it was noted by a Federal Reserve official that there were currently 857,000,000-dollar coins (including Presidential dollars) in government storage vaults, an amount estimated to satisfy the demand for twelve years.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} of Giffnock first appeared as Gisnock, in an atlas created by Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu in 1654, the first atlas of Scotland. Giffnock {{was primarily a}} scattered farming community until the late 1780s, when Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton was forced to partition the land {{into a number of}} small properties <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> raise finances.|$|E

5|$|With {{a stadium}} {{capacity}} of 70,500, a {{total amount of}} 46,000 tickets were available to fans and the general public, with the two finalist teams receiving 20,000 tickets each and with 6,000 tickets being available <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> fans worldwide via UEFA.com from 5 to 23 March 2015 in four price categories: €390, €280, €160, and €70. The rest of 24,500 tickets were allocated to sponsors and officials.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing. The {{greatest}} of these is global warming and the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the first}} corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also more resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> collectors.|$|E
5|$|Before the final, both finalists {{were awarded}} 12,000 tickets. The Danish Football Association {{announced}} that 9,000 tickets would be offered, <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> the public, while the remaining 3,000 {{were sold to}} other European countries. UEFA allocated another 3,000 tickets to their officials and VIP members. Problems ensued after {{it was revealed that}} Galatasaray had been charging the tickets more than the original price, in order to prevent some football hooligans from entering the ground. The Turkish club's secretary general however, denied this and insisted that the tickets were being sold at their original price and to support the stadium and the club's other sporting activities.|$|E

50|$|Greenheart Group {{operates}} a hardwood business in Suriname. The company practices sustainable forest harvesting {{and has two}} large scale sawmills <b>to</b> produce lumber <b>for</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> Europe and Asia. The company is also building a bioenergy plant to convert timber waste into clean energy.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, in {{connection}} with the Gaza war, British government ministers said no new arms export licenses would be granted <b>for</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> Israel until a formal peace is agreed. In case hostilities are to flare up, exports under existing licenses would reportedly be discontinued.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars and the {{subsequent}} agricultural depression, coupled {{with the collapse of the}} Tonbridge Bank in 1812, Woodgate was declared bankrupt in 1816. In that year, Woodgate offered Somerhill <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> the Duke of Wellington, who declined to buy it as the foxhunting was not good enough for his liking. Somerhill was bought from the descendants of William Woodgate in November 1819 by James Alexander, MP. By 1830, Somerhill had been substantially repaired, and new landscaping was undertaken. In 1832, Anthony Salvin was engaged to make improvements to the house, but retaining its original style. During the severe winter of 1835-36, skating was possible on the lake at Somerhill for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Lunalilo left no heirs. The {{legislature}} was {{empowered by}} the constitution to elect the monarch in these instances and chose David Kalākaua as the next monarch. The new ruler was pressured by the U.S. government to surrender Pearl Harbor to the Navy. Kalākaua was concerned that this would lead to annexation by the U.S. and to the contravening of {{the traditions of the}} Hawaiian people, who believed that the land ('Āina) was fertile, sacred, and not <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> anyone. In 1875, the United States Congress agreed to an additional seven years of reciprocity in exchange for Ford Island. At the end of the seven-year reciprocity agreement, the United States showed little interest in renewal.|$|E
5|$|Motor Racing Developments {{initially}} {{concentrated on}} making money by building cars <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> customers in lower formulae, so {{the new car}} for the Formula One team was not ready until partway through the 1962 Formula One season. The Brabham Racing Organisation (BRO) started the year fielding a customer Lotus chassis, which was delivered at 3:00 am {{in order to keep}} it a secret. Brabham took two points finishes in Lotuses, before the turquoise-liveried Brabham BT3 car made its debut at the 1962 German Grand Prix. It retired with a throttle problem after 9 of the 15 laps, but went on to take a pair of fourth places {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
50|$|Biomass {{based on}} {{renewable}} {{sources such as}} rice husk could generate up to 20 MW at competitive prices. Firewood has already {{been used as a}} substitute for fuel oil in the 1980s, and cellulose projects expect to generate up <b>to</b> 65 MW <b>for</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> the network.|$|R
50|$|In the 1800s, the {{functions}} of assay offices in the U.S. included receiving bullion deposits from the public and from mining prospectors in the various American territories. The assay offices that still operate today function solely within national coining system (including bullion coinage <b>for</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> investors).|$|R
25|$|In March 2009, Diamond {{achieved}} EASA certification for the Austro Engine AE 300, {{which enabled}} the DA42 to resume production; {{equipped with the}} Austro engine, these aircraft were designated and marketed as the DA42 NG. In April 2009, the first Austro-powered DA42 NG was delivered to a customer in Sweden. On 9 April 2010, the DA42 NG received FAA certification, clearing the way <b>for</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> resume to North American customers.|$|R
5|$|Numismatist Bruce C. Goldstein {{indicated}} that several factors combined {{to keep the}} nickel three-cent piece in decline {{after the passage of}} the 1873 act. Less and less fractional currency was being redeemed, as almost a decade had passed since the issuance of three-cent notes. Rich silver strikes in the West lowered the price of that metal to the point where old silver coins emerged from hoarding and circulated again. These factors, combined with ample stocks of cents and nickels, made the three-cent nickel, a non-silver coin of odd denomination, less desirable. By 1876, the mintage for circulation had declined to 162,000. None were struck for circulation in 1877 and 1878, though some proof coins were minted <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> the public.|$|E
5|$|Poh Ern Shih {{is located}} on the top of Chwee Chian Hill, off Pasir Panjang Road, on Singapore's {{southern}} coast. Facing the hilltop is Bukit Chandu ('Opium Hill' in Malay), where the British East India Company had an opium factory to process raw opium from the Golden Triangle <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> China and South East Asia in the 19th century. To protect its military facilities in the vicinity, the British colonial government placed heavy artillery guns on Chwee Chian Hill before the onset of the Second World War, in anticipation of seaborne attacks by the Japanese off the coast of Pasir Panjang.|$|E
5|$|The {{farmhouse}} {{was damaged}} by fire in 1897. In 1926 the owner, Somerset cricketer Major Vernon Hill, offered the priory <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> the local council, but the council did not purchase it. Major and Mrs Hill continued {{to own the}} priory until 1928, when it was bought by the Agricultural Land Company and rented to local farmers. In 1932 it was the venue for Alan Cobham's Flying Circus providing aviation displays. In 1968 the priory and adjoining land of Middle Hope was purchased by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty as part of Project Neptune.|$|E
50|$|The South African {{government}} instructed {{that all}} salt <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> was <b>to</b> be iodised after December 12, 1995.|$|R
25|$|The 2007–08 {{report found}} that there was growth in {{extraction}} of wood <b>for</b> illegal <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> third parties.|$|R
50|$|Pre-contact {{forms of}} slavery were {{generally}} {{distinct from the}} form of chattel slavery developed by Europeans in North America during the colonial period. European influence greatly changed slavery used by Native Americans. As they raided other tribes <b>to</b> capture slaves <b>for</b> <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> Europeans, they fell into destructive wars among themselves, and against Europeans.|$|R
