40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation on the <b>devitalization</b> of eight selected enteric viruses suspended in estuarine water was determined. The surviving fractions of each virus were calculated and then plotted against the UV exposure time {{for purposes of}} comparison. Analytical assessment of the survival data for each virus consisted of least squares regression analysis for determination of intercepts and slope functions. All data were examined for statistical significance. When the slope function of each virus was compared against the slope function of poliovirus type 1, the analytical findings indicated that poliovirus types 2 and 3, echovirus types 1 and 11, and coxsackievirus A- 9 exhibited similar <b>devitalization</b> characteristics in that {{no statistically significant difference}} was found (P > 0. 05). Conversely, the <b>devitalization</b> characteristics of coxsackievirus B- 1 and reovirus type 1 were dissimilar from those of poliovirus type 1 in that a statistically significant difference was found between the slope functions (P < 0. 05). This observed difference in <b>devitalization</b> of coxsackievirus B- 1 and reovirus type 1 was attributed primarily to the frequency distribution of single and aggregate virions, the geometric configuration, the size of the aggregates, and the severity of aggregation. The <b>devitalization</b> curve of coxsackievirus B- 1 was characteristic of a retardant die-away curve. The <b>devitalization</b> curve of reovirus type 1 was characteristic of a multihittype curve. The calculated <b>devitalization</b> half-life values for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3; echovirus types 1 and 11; coxsackievirus types A- 9 and B- 1; and reovirus type 1 were 2. 8, 3. 1, 2. 7, 2. 8, 3. 2, 3. 1, 4. 0, 4. 0 sec, respectively.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess efficacy and safety of percutaneous ultrasound (US) guided preferential radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) in early breast carcinoma under local anesthesia and to evaluate a new assessment protocol. Eighteen breast cancer patients were enrolled in order to receive PRFA treatment three weeks prior to resection. Pain assessment was performed using the visual analoge scale. Analysis of treatment success was performed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as histological assays for hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and cytokeratine 8 (CK 8). In a subset of patients contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was performed before and after treatment. MRI showed no residual tumor growth in 100 % (18 / 18) of cases.

40|$|Five {{children}} from asylum-seeking families required hospital care due to serious {{loss of function}} arising in the ‘limbo ’ conditions {{in which they were}} living as refugees. Hopelessness, helplessness and an uncertain time perspective dominated family life; they had not worked through the traumas of the intolerable life from which they had fled. The massive loss of functions in the children resembles that of pervasive refusal syndrome (PRS), but the purposive aspect of the refusal seemed less pronounced. Treatment applying the principles for managing PRS was rapidly successful. The fixed behaviour of the mothers – staging a delusion/fantasy that the child was dying – was interpreted as a desperate coping strategy. It made the situation ‘understandable ’ and bestowed on them a role and a meaningful function. Improvements in the children were not noticed until the mothers gave up this ‘lethal ’ mothering. The interplay between parents and their children seemed of greater importance to the child than the information provided by the actual circumstances of their lives.

40|$|This work {{aimed to}} define the {{molecular}} and chemical signature of a S. palustre clone developed {{in the framework of}} the EU-FP 7 Mossclone project to improve the standardization and reliability of the moss-bag technique. The molecular characterization was performed by a set of DNA molecular markers (RAPD, ISJ, PCR-RFLP, sequencing and microsatellites) to tag the clone produced within the project. Molecular characterization also provided new DNA markers that can be applied in systematic analyses of Sphagnum, and gave new insights to implement well established techniques. The elemental composition of the clone was measured by ICP-MS analysis of 54 major and trace elements, with and without commonly applied pre-exposure treatments (oven <b>devitalization</b> and EDTA washing). Concentrations of almost all analyzed elements were significantly lower (from 10 to 100 times) in the clone than in conspecific field moss, apart from some elements (K, Mo, P and Na) deriving from the culture medium or EDTA treatment. Oven <b>devitalization</b> and EDTA washing did not significantly affect the clone composition. A comparison between the elemental composition of the clone with that of naturally growing Sphagnum species proved the particularly low elemental content of the clone. Therefore, in view of a rigorously standardized moss-bag protocol for the monitoring of persistent atmospheric pollutants, the use of the S. palustre clone, a biomaterial with very low and constant element composition, and homogenous morphological characteristics is strongly recommended...|$|E

40|$|Intestinal <b>devitalization</b> {{in cases}} of small colon {{obstruction}} {{may be difficult to}} detect based only in clinical signs. The purpose was to serially evaluate blood and peritoneal fluid of horses subjected to small colon distension. Seventeen adult horses were allotted in three groups. In the small colon-distended group (DG, n= 7) a surgically-implanted latex balloon was inflated to promote intraluminal small colon distension. In the shamoperated group (SG, n= 5), the balloon was implanted but not inflated, and no surgery was done in the control group (CG, n= 5). Blood and peritoneal fluid were sampled before and after (6 samples with a 30 -minute interval) intestinal obstruction for cytological and biochemical analyses. No significant changes in clinical signs occurred within groups or across time during the experimental period. There were no statistical differences among SG and SG groups in hematologic and blood chemistry variables. Although total protein concentration and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in peritoneal fluid remained most of the time within reference values during the experimental period in all groups, increases from baseline values were detected in SG and DG groups. Such increases occurred earlier, progressively and with greater magnitude in the DG when compared with the SG (P< 0. 05). Increases from baselines values were also observed in total nucleated cells and neutrophils counts in the DG (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, distension of the equine small colon induced progressive subtle increases in total protein and LDH concentrations in the peritoneal fluid during the first hours.

40|$|Background and Aims The gastric mucosa is an {{endocrine}} organ that regulates satiation pathways by expression of orexigenic and anorexigenic hormones. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) excludes gastric mucosa and reduces gastric volume. Our study aimed {{to investigate the}} independent effects of altering gastric mucosa on obesity and its related comorbidities. Methods Gastric mucosa <b>devitalization</b> (GMD) of 70 % of the stomach was achieved by argon plasma coagulation in a high-fat diet rat model and was compared with VSG and sham surgery. In an 8 -week follow-up study, we quantified body weight, visceral adiposity, insulin resistance index, cholesterol profiles, and free fatty acid profiles by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Following a 2 -hour oral glucose tolerance test, the kinetics of ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide- 1, peptide YY, and serum and liver bile acid levels were measured. Liver lipid content was quantified by ELISA. Results GMD resulted in significant reductions in body weight, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, and hepatic steatosis {{as well as an}} improvement in lipid metabolism. GMD resulted in significant reductions in food intake and intestinal malabsorption of free fatty acids, both contributing to improved body composition and metabolic profile. Mechanistically, GMD resulted in a significant reduction in serum palmitate levels as well as an increase in serum and liver bile acid levels, known to alter glucose and lipid metabolism. Similar changes were noted when VSG rats were compared with sham surgery rats. Conclusions <b>Devitalization</b> of gastric mucosa, independent of altering gastric volume, was able to reduce obesity-related comorbidities.
