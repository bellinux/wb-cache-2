A full-scale test, of which the general set-up and consistency check are outlined in the thesis, examining the feasibility of foundation improvement by means of grouting techniques was conducted in Amsterdam. The main part of the thesis focuses on permeation grouting, jet grouting and compaction <b>grouting.</b> For each <b>method,</b> first some more general aspects like history, grouting equipment, grouting parameters and fields of application are outlined. Subsequently existing theories used in modelling the grouting process are examined and compared. The test results are discussed. By using the pile displacements, soil stresses, pore pressures and pile bearing capacity measured in the test, it was possible to examine the influence of <b>grouting</b> <b>methods</b> on pile foundations. The use of and suitability of geophysical verification <b>methods</b> for <b>grouting,</b> which were necessary to determine the shape and position of grouted elements, were also considered. To determine how <b>grouting</b> <b>methods</b> can best be applied for foundation renovation purposes, the cost of <b>grouting</b> <b>methods</b> and the hindrance that they cause have been compared with those of conventional foundation renovation methods. The construction cost of grouting can be up to about 50 % lower than that of conventional methods of underpinning a structure. Taking cost, hindrance and the test results into consideration, it can be concluded that permeation grouting and compaction grouting are economic and effective alternatives to conventional underpinning methods for renovating pile foundations. The methods may also be used for pile foundation protection. Jet grouting is only suitable for use in the renovation of end bearing piles when the structure is strong and stiff enough to redistribute the loads from the grouted pile. Jet grouting is very suitable for use in protecting pile foundations because it can be applied in any type of soil. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Mini-piles may either be augured or driven steel cased, and are normally between 150 mm and 300 mm in diameter. Structural engineers will use rigs which are specifically designed to operate in environments with restricted headroom and limited space, and can gain access through a regular domestic doorway. They are capable of constructing piles to depths of up to 15 m. The technique of minipiling was first applied in Italy in 1952, and has gone through a plethora of different names, reflecting worldwide acceptance and expiration of the original patents.The relatively small diameter of mini-piles is extremely distinctive of this type of underpinning and generally uses anchoring or tie backs into an existing structure or rock.

Based on the fluid-structure interaction theory and orthogonal analysis method, the influence of reinforcement cycle thickness, elastic modulus, and permeability on water inflow of tunnel after grouting and stability of surrounding rock was analyzed. As to the water inflow of tunnel after grouting used as performance evaluation index of grouting reinforcement cycle, it can be concluded that the permeability was the most important factor followed by reinforcement cycle thickness and elastic modulus. Furthermore, pore water pressure field, stress field, and plastic zone of surrounding rock were calculated by using COMSOL software under different conditions of reinforcement cycle thickness. It also can be concluded that the optimal thickness of reinforcement cycle and permeability can be adopted as 8 [*]m and 1 / 100 of the surrounding rock permeability in the curtain grouting reinforcement cycle. The engineering case provides a reference for similar engineering...|$|E
40|$|This report {{focuses on}} the {{forensic}} analysis and evaluation of large-scale post-tensioned beam specimens after nearly 8 years of extremely aggressive exposure testing. The research was funded jointly by both FHWA and TxDOT. The relationship between durability performance and the following variables was evaluated in this study: level of applied load and initial cracking, level of prestress, duct type, strand type, grout type, <b>grouting</b> <b>method,</b> use of encapsulated system for anchorage protection, and galvanized duct splice type. In addition, the applicability of half-cell potentials and chloride penetration tests for evaluating the likelihood of corrosion was examined. Major findings were: 1) mixed reinforcement (also known as partial prestressing), performed poorly from a durability standpoint. Only fully prestressed beams offered better durability performance than those which were not prestressed at all. 2) Corrugated steel galvanized ducts performed very poorly. Large holes {{were found in the}} ducts, and in some cases several inches of the ducts completely corroded away. 3) Corrugated plastic ducts offer better performance {{as long as they are}} "robust. " 4) Non-flowfilled epoxy coated strand and galvanized strand offered no significant improvement in long-term durability over conventional strand. 5) Installing plastic caps ove...|$|E
40|$|AbstractJilin highway {{concrete}} bridge {{is located in}} the center of Jilin City, which is positioned in the middle and southern part in Jilin province in east north of China. This bridge crosses the Songhua River. The strengthening of {{concrete bridge}} structure involves upgrading of the strength and stiffness of structural members, and the repair process involves reestablishing the strength and function of the damaged members. The main objectives of this study are to identify the damaged members of Jilin highway concrete bridge structure and to explain the application of strengthening and repair methods to improve the performance of the bridge structural members. The results of damages investigation of a bridge structure appearance show that the most components of the bridge are in good conditions with the exception arch waves, spandrel arch, deck pavement of the new arch bridge, and corbel of the old simply supported beam bridge which suffer from serious damages. In this study, jacketing <b>method,</b> <b>grouting</b> repair <b>method,</b> patching method, and replacement of expansion joint and drainage system had been used to strengthen and repair the damaged members of Jilin highway concrete bridge. After completing the strengthening and repair processes, the state of arch waves, spandrel arch, and deck pavement is good, but there is need to evaluate the performance of structural members which are strengthened and repaired by adopting static and dynamic load tests, and monitoring the development of cracks...|$|R

It presents the materials and techniques of <b>grouting,</b> and <b>methods</b> of evaluation, focusing on lime- and hydraulic lime-based grouts. This review indicates {{that a variety of}} materials have been investigated for use as injection grouts, and numerous commercial and custom-mixed grouts are available to conservators today. However, there are few standard or well-established methods to assess them, which have led {{to a wide range of}} test methods for their preparation, characterization, and evaluation. It is clear that a systematic study of the working and performance properties, test methods, and preparation and curing conditions is needed, as is an evaluation of products being used in the fiel...|$|R
40|$|Development in {{grouting}} {{technique and}} its material causes an increasingly demand of its using in geotechnical constructions. To evaluate the grouting effect, a laboratory or field test towards {{the physical and}} mechanical properties of grouted soil and rock is needed. One of <b>methods</b> for evaluate <b>grouting</b> distribution is geoelectric or resistivity sounding method. This study is purposed to identify the subsurface resistivity change of study area before and after grouting using resistivity data from resistivity sounding <b>method.</b> Evaluation towards <b>grouting</b> effect can be determined by comparing the resistivity value change before and after grouting. Grouting effect and its distribution in soil and rock is analysed using isoresistivity map before and after <b>grouting.</b> <b>Methods</b> {{used in this study}} are survey and descriptive method supported by literature references for determine geological and geotechnical characteristics of study area. Geoelectric measurement uses Schlumberger’s configuration array. Resistivity data before and after grouting is used to interpret subsurface section along the study area. Based on this data, the resistivity value change before and after grouting can be analysed. Isoresistivity map is needed to determine the grouting distribution at various definite depths. Type of soil is mould soil which is loose, not compacted, and has uneven density along this area. Otherwise, tuffaceous sand and tuff characterized with cracks and joints. Grouting is needed to fix these weaknesses. Data analysis shows there is a relatively decrease in resistivity value after grouting, which is mould soil has average value 27. 43 ohm meter before grouting, decrease to 23. 66 ohm meter after grouting; tuffaceous sandstone decrease from average value 22. 15 ohm meter to 17. 13 ohm meter; tuff decrease from average value 11. 70 to 8. 36 ohm meter. Depth of grouting distribution can reach 7 meter depth, which is minimum 1 meter vertically from injection depth. Lateral distribution of grouting material can covers all of this grouted area with 3 meters spacing. Medium of grouting distribution is pore spaces in mould soil, otherwise cracks and pore spaces in tuffaceous sandstone and tuff...|$|R
