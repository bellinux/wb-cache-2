5|$|Associations {{with various}} climate and {{environmental}} trends exist. For example, an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> surface temperature of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea) increases atmospheric moisture content.

5|$|Like in Sandakan, {{people in}} Tawau have always {{relied on the}} sea for their sustenance. Every day, {{hundreds}} of deep sea trawlers and tuckboats {{can be seen at}} the Cowie Bay. Barter trade also happens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> area around Tawau. The Tawau marine zone are one of Sabah four marine zones, with the other been in Sandakan, Kudat and the west coast. A great variety of high-grade fishes and all kinds of crustaceans were found in abundance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> and waterways around Tawau. Prawn farming has become largest sea economic source for the district. The oldest and largest prawn farm were located in this area together with six frozen shrimp processing plants.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Reynolds began a long {{academic}} career at Princeton University.

He combined his interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> and science by working during the summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where he studied marine bioluminescence.

5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> and again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within the tropics, but {{air in the}} tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> surface temperature for each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E

5|$|British and French {{submarine}} operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Marmara {{were the}} one significant area of success of the Gallipoli Campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five gunboats, 11 troop transports, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels {{at a cost of}} eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Marmara. During the campaign there was always one British submarine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region. E2 left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles. By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease operations in the area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.|$|E
5|$|Caprellamutica {{were first}} {{described}} in 1935 by A. Schurin from specimens {{collected from the}} Peter the Great Gulf <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Japan. It belongs to the genus Caprella in the subfamily Caprellinae of the family Caprellidae, a group of highly specialized amphipods commonly known as skeleton shrimp. Caprellids are classified under the superfamily Caprelloidea of the infraorder Caprellida.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} {{is known}} from several groups of animals both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> and on land (see table). Cleaners include fish, shrimps and birds; clients include {{a much wider}} range of fish, marine reptiles including turtles and iguanas, octopus, whales, and terrestrial mammals. Cleaning symbioses with reptile clients include fish cleaning the teeth of American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus), geckos eating mosquitoes on Aldabra giant tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) and scarlet crabs (Grapsus grapsus), and three species of Galapagos finches removing ticks from marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus).|$|E

5|$|During the Victorian era Clevedon {{became a}} popular seaside town; before {{that it had}} been an {{agricultural}} village. The Victorian craze for bathing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> was catered for in the late 19th century by saltwater baths adjacent to the pier (since demolished, though the foundations remain), and bathing machines on the main beach.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{taken into}} account when designing the building include the polycarbonate cladding, used for natural light and passive heating; and a hydronic heating and cooling system using the constant temperature of the sea water below the pontoon. As a floating structure, {{it will not be}} affected by rises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> level. The gabled roof design is intended to fit in with the other buildings in Sullivans Cove including PW1, Elizabeth Street Pier and the Mac02 Cruise Terminal– which themselves are based on the historic use of the area as a freight port.|$|E
5|$|For Asian stocks, {{resident}} {{groups may}} {{exist in the}} Yellow Sea and East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan (though these populations are critically endangered and the population off China, Korea, and Japan are either near extinction or in very small numbers).
