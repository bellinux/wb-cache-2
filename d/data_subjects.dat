5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the National Geographic Database, the National Register of Electors is used to create preliminary voters lists for each electoral district in Canada for each election, byelection, and referendum. Each candidate from each electoral district is given a voters list for that district, which is {{a subset of the}} data in the National Register of Electors whose addresses are within the boundaries of the district as defined in the National Geographic Database. That data may only be used for election purposes; any other use of that <b>data</b> <b>subjects</b> the user to penalties including fines, imprisonment, or both. The voter lists are updated by returning officers based on information received during an election campaign, ultimately resulting in final voters lists being distributed by election day.|$|E

50|$|Concerning the {{obligations}} and {{duties of the}} operator of a search engine, the Court held that {{in the present case}} Article 7(f) of the Directive, relating to legitimacy of processing, requires a balancing of the opposing rights and interests of the <b>data</b> <b>subject</b> (González) and the data controller (Google), taking into account the <b>data</b> <b>subject's</b> rights deriving from Articles 7 (respect for private and family life) and 8 (protection of personal data) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Article 14(a) of the Directive, relating to the <b>data</b> <b>subject's</b> rights, allows the <b>data</b> <b>subject,</b> at least in the cases covered by Articles 7(e) and 7(f), to object at any time on compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation to the processing of data relating to him, save where otherwise provided by national legislation. Article 12(b) of the Directive, relating to the <b>data</b> <b>subject's</b> right of access to the data, allows the <b>data</b> <b>subject</b> to request erasure of the data. Such request may be made directly of the controller, who must then duly examine the merits of the request. If the request is not granted, the <b>data</b> <b>subject</b> may then direct the request to a supervisory authority or the judicial authority so that it carries out the necessary checks and orders the controller to take specific measures accordingly.|$|R

2500|$|Special {{personal}} data may, however, be processed {{where it is}} necessary or the data subject has given consent to the processing (Section 37(2)). Processing of {{personal data}} is necessary where it is to exercise a right, or fulfil an obligation conferred or imposed by law on an employer (Section 37(3)). Special personal data relating to <b>data</b> <b>subjects</b> may also be processed where {{it is necessary for}} the protection of the vital interest of the data subject, where it is impossible for the data subject to give consent, or the data controller cannot reasonably be expected to obtain consent, or consent by the data subject has been unreasonably withheld.

40|$|A {{person who}} is {{communication}} about (the <b>data</b> <b>subject)</b> has {{to keep track of}} all of his revealed data in order to protect his right of informational self-determination. This is important when data is going to be processed in an automatic manner and, in particular, in case of automatic inquiries. A <b>data</b> <b>subject</b> should, therefore, be enabled to recognize useful decisions with respect to data disclosure, only by using data which is available to him. For the scope of this thesis, we assume that a <b>data</b> <b>subject</b> is able to protect his communication contents and the corresponding communication context against a third party by using end-to-end encryption and Mix cascades. The objective is to develop a model for analyzing the linkability of communication contents by using Formal Concept Analysis. In contrast to previous work, only the knowledge of a <b>data</b> <b>subject</b> is used for this analysis instead of a global view on the entire communication contents and context. As a first step, the relation between disclosed data is explored. It is shown how data can be grouped by types and data implications can be represented. As a second step, behavior, i. e. actions and reactions, of the <b>data</b> <b>subject</b> and his communication partners is included in this analysis in order to find critical data sets which can be used to identify the <b>data</b> <b>subject.</b> Typical examples are used to verify this analysis, followed by a conclusion about pros and cons of this method for anonymity and linkability measurement. Results can be used, later on, in order to develop a similarity measure for human-computer interfaces...|$|R

30|$|Key {{elements}} of the new regulation include, for example: the need for clear and affirmative consent by the <b>data</b> <b>subject</b> concerned, destruction of data if storage is no longer necessary for the initial purpose or after withdrawal of consent by the <b>data</b> <b>subject</b> (‘the right to be forgotten’); the right to obtain rectification of his/her personal data; {{the right of the}} <b>data</b> <b>subject</b> to transfer personal data to another service provider (‘data portability’); the right of the <b>data</b> <b>subject</b> to be informed when his/her data have been hacked. The new GDPR implies that all organisations processing personal data must be able to prove that they comply with the rules. It also proposes a European Data Protection Board and requires institutions which process certain types or volumes of data to have a designated data protection officer (DPO), who is in contact with the national data protection authorities. The legislation also specifies that ‘effective, proportionate and dissuasive’ penalties or financial fines may apply in the case of non-compliance with the data protection rules.|$|R
