40|$|The work {{conducted}} {{in this project}} {{is an extension of}} the developments itemized in DE-FG- 36 - 04 GO 14236. This program is designed to help the development of a biorefinery based around a raw sugar mill, which in Louisiana is an underutilized asset. Some technical questions were answered regarding the addition of a biomass to ethanol facility to existing sugar mills. The focus of this work is on developing technology to produce ethanol and valuable by-products from bagasse. Three major areas are addressed, feedstock storage, potential by-products and the technology for producing ethanol from dilute ammonia pre-treated bagasse. Sugar mills normally store bagasse in a simple pile. During the off season there is a natural degradation of the bagasse, due to the composting action of microorganisms in the pile. This has serious implications if bagasse must be stored to operate a bagasse/biorefinery for a 300 + day operating cycle. Deterioration of the fermentables in bagasse was found to be 6. 5 % per month, on pile storage. This indicates that long term storage of adequate amounts of bagasse for year-round operation is probably not feasible. Lignin from pretreatment seemed to offer a potential source of valuable by-products. Although a wide range of phenolic compounds were present in the effluent from dilute ammonia pretreatment, the concentrations of each (except for benzoic acid) were too low to consider for extraction. The cellulosic hydrolysis system was modified to produce commercially recoverable quantities of cellobiose, which has a small but growing market in the food process industries. A spin-off of this led to the production of a specific oligosaccharide which appears to have both medical and commercial implications as a fungal growth inhibitor. An alternate use of sugars produced from biomass hydrolysis would be to produce succinic acid as a chemical feedstock for other conversions. An organism was developed which can do this bioconversion, but the economics of succinic acid production were such that it could not compete with current commercial practice. To allow recovery of commercial amounts of ethanol from bagasse fermentation, research was conducted on high solids loading fermentations (using S. cerevisiae) with commercial cellulase on pretreated material. A combination of SHF/SSF treatment with fed-batch operation allowed fermentation at 30 % solids loading. Supplementation of the fermentation {{with a small amount of}} black-strap molasses had results beyond expectation. There was an enhancement of conversion as well as production of ethanol levels above 6. 0 % w/w, which is required both for efficient distillation as well as contaminant repression. The <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> development was only on converting the cellulose to ethanol, as this yeast is not capable of fermenting both glucose and xylose (from hemicellulose). In anticipation of the future development of such an organism, we screened the commercially available xylanases to find the optimum mix for conversion of both cellulose and hemicellulose. A different mixture than the spezyme/novozyme mix used in our fermentation research was found to be more efficient at converting both cellulose and hemicellulose. Efforts were made to select a mutant of Pichia stipitis for ability to co-ferment glucose and xylose to ethanol. New mutation technology was developed, but an appropriate mutant has not yet been isolated. The ability to convert to stillage from biomass fermentations were determined to be suitable for anaerobic degradation and methane production. An economic model of a current sugar factory was developed in order to provide a baseline for the cost/benefit analysis of adding cellulosic ethanol production...|$|E

40|$|This work <b>focuses</b> on <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> pre-treated waste {{activated}} sludge (WAS) to generate volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Pre-treatment by high-pressure thermal hydrolysis (HFTH) was shown to aid WAS fermentation. Compared to <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> raw WAS, pre-treatment enabled a 2 - 5 x increase in VFA yield (gVFA(COD) gTCOD(- 1)) and 4 - 6 x increase in VFA production rate (gVFA(COD) L(- 1) d(- 1)). Three sludges, pre-treated in full-scale HPTH plants, were fermented. One was from a plant processing a mix of primary sludge and WAS {{and the other two}} from plants processing solely WAS. The HPTH plants solubilised suspended matter, evidenced by a 20 - 30 % decrease in suspended solids and an increase of soluble COD; total COD from 0. 04 to 0. 4. <b>Fermentation</b> <b>of</b> the three sludges yielded similar VFA concentrations (15 - 20 gVFA(COD) L(- 1)). The yields were largely independent of retention time (1 d- 6 d) and temperature (42 degrees C, 55 degrees C). Also, the product spectrum depended mostly on the composition of the sludge rather than on operating conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|However, the {{mechanism}} of inhibition caused by moderate concentrations of 3 -HPA has not been studied systematically. As an intermediate product, 3 -HPA accumulates in the early stage <b>of</b> <b>fermentation.</b> The accumulation <b>of</b> 3 -HPA in the culture medium can significantly decrease most of the enzymatic activities in K. pneumoniae strains {{with the exception of}} lactate dehydrogenase (the key enzyme in the interconversion of lactate to pyruvate) [[11]].

40|$|The aim {{of study}} is to {{investigate}} the softening of cassava leaves during the <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> Ntoba mbodi and the mineral content of cassava leaves fermented and unfermented. The softening of cassava leaves is a characteristic <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> to produce Ntoba mbodi. It is due to an enzymatic process. The activity of cellulase and polygalacturonase enzymes, very weak at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>fermentation,</b> increases sharply in 24 h and decreases thereafter. The pectinesterase and pectin lyase activity, already present at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>fermentation,</b> reaches the maximum after 24 h <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> for pectinesterase and 48 h for pectin lyase. The cellulase is mainly of microbial origin.

40|$|It is {{a general}} {{experience}} that fermentations come to end, even before all the fermentable substrate is used up. There are various explanations for this gradual retardation and ultimate cessation of the rate of fermentation; it {{may be due to}} lack of substrate, or to toxic action <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> products, or to some other toxic cell product not generally considered a fermentation product, or to some biological change of the cells. While all these reasons might occasionally occur, the common cause of the decrease in the rate <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> ordinarily is either the accu-mulation <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> products, or the decrease of ferment-able substrate. The concentration of the substrate must become very low before it exerts a retarding influence because the rate <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> is independent <b>of</b> the concentration of the substrate. The independent relation <b>of</b> alcoholic <b>fermentation</b> to sugar concentration was demonstrated by Slator as early as 1906. His data show that the rate is nearly constaAt if the sugar con-centration exceeds 1. 5 per cent. As far as the author has been able to find, this rule has not been proven for any other type <b>of</b> <b>fermentation.</b> The lack <b>of</b> dependence <b>of</b> the <b>fermentation</b> upon the con-centrationi is of considerable significance for the understanding <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> and growth. It is, therefore, desirable to have more proof for this rule. Some very good examples can be found in Rubner's studies (1912) on the alcoholic fermentation. A good deil of interesting material has been gathered in this treatise which fills a whole volume. But it is hidden in a queer phrase-ology, and that may account for the fact that these data are hardly known in American literature...|$|R

Both the natural sources <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> (NSF) imparted different flavours notes like lactic, sharp, acetic and fruity to the wine. “W” strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae gave wines with higher astringency and phenolic flavours, ethyl acetate like, acetaldehyde like flavour, UCD 505 and UCD 522 fermentated wines were peculiar for more ethanolic, sweety and bitter taste, whereas UCD 595 imparted more phenolic, astringent, sour, and ethanolic flavour notes to the wines. The addition of nitrogen source (irrespective <b>of</b> source <b>of</b> <b>fermentation)</b> reduced the development of some flavours considered undesirable (acetic, amyl alcoholic, fusel alcoholic, vegetative). Addition of nitrogen source enhanced the intensity of some other flavour attributes like ethanolic and phenolic in the wines. Due to the same vinification practices (except for the source <b>of</b> <b>fermentation)</b> some modifications in the flavour attributes of apple wines fermented by natural source <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> were recorded. The flavour profile of wines fermented by different sources <b>of</b> <b>fermentation,</b> was also reflected in the chemical characteristics examined.
