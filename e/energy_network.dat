Using an <b>energy</b> <b>network,</b> all ships of the fleet transfer their energy to the leading ship, carrying the weapon, that can destroy Earth. The Alliance has only one chance: If the <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> is saturated it will still take some time, until the weapon is ready to fire. If the leading ship is destroyed, while the <b>energy</b> <b>network</b> is saturated, a feedback impulse will destroy all ships in the network. The plan succeeds and the Vonari withdraw.|$|E
