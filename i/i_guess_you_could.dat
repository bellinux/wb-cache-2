500|$|An {{interviewer}} {{concluded that}} Howarth was physically attractive {{and that this}} {{may have contributed to}} the character's magnetism. Howarth replied, [...] "I know what the convention of a good-looking person is, and I know that for some reason skinny white guys are big now. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> blame it on that." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 27, 2005, Hastert {{became the}} first Speaker to author a blog. On [...] "Speaker's Journal" [...] on his {{official}} House website, Hastert wrote in his first post: [...] "This is Denny Hastert and welcome to my blog. This is new to me. I can’t say I’m much of a techie. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say my office is teaching the old guy new tricks. But I'm excited. This is the future. And {{it is a new}} way for us to get our message out." ...|$|E
500|$|Drummer Sherman Ferguson said of Ibn Ali, [...] "he was a {{prime example}} of {{somebody}} that was very avant-garde in some ways, but he was always musical. So people of all ages liked his music, even when he played out. [...] had that thing, where he had a natural feeling. He got to the thing where it swung no matter what he was doing." [...] Saxophonist Benny Golson commented that Ibn Ali [...] "became very skilled at the modern sounds, and then went right past them into something very esoteric. He went way out there. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say his brakes didn't work." ...|$|E
5000|$|Levy {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "a romantic suspense story that only uses two principals. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say that, through {{the basis of a}} passive love story, we learn how a crime of passion was committed." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>guess</b> though <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{honestly}} say {{the relationship between}} Greg (Chappell) and myself, {{when he came back}} from World Series Cricket, {{and all of a sudden}} I was playing in Queensland with him, was difficult for a little while.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I started he wasn't conscious. Shock collapse, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> but <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{hear his}} breath and a little color was coming to his skin. On the whole, I think if they get a doctor quick he'll pull Douglas through. The trouble is, we won't know-- But we'll talk about this again. The ground ahead is blamed steep. Looks as if we might hit an awkward schrund {{at the top of}} the glacier. Anyhow, we'll wait a bit. I think the moon's coming out." ...|$|R
500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson {{described}} his character Guy, saying, “He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature {{and he has}} some rough edges and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say the same for me.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Don Henley {{has given}} a number of {{explanations}} about the song, ranging from [...] "a journey from innocence to experience" [...] to [...] "a sociopolitical statement". In an interview with Rolling Stone, Henley said that the song {{was meant to be}} [...] "more of a symbolic piece about America in general", and added: [...] "Lyrically, the song deals with traditional or classical themes of conflict: darkness and light, good and evil, youth and age, the spiritual versus the secular. [...] <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say it's a song about loss of innocence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I will, Robert Herrick," [...] {{said the}} captain. [...] "But first, let's see all clear. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know," [...] he said, with {{imperious}} solemnity, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know {{the bottom is}} out of this Farallone speculation? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know it's right out? and if this old island hadn't been turned up right when it did, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know where you and I and Huish would have been?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh, Puck! Puck! <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> {{right from}} {{when you talked}} about the salt. How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> ever do it?' Una cried, {{swinging}} along delighted.|$|R
2500|$|Gibson was {{initially}} reluctant {{to accept the}} role of Guy Hamilton. [...] "I didn't necessarily see my role as a great challenge. My character was, like the film suggests, a puppet. And I went with that. It wasn't some star thing, even though they advertised it that way." [...] Gibson saw some similarities {{between himself and the}} character of Guy. [...] "He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature and he has some rough edges and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say the same for me." [...] Gibson has cited this screen performance as his personal favorite.|$|E
2500|$|Mutemath has {{resisted}} being {{classified as a}} Christian band, even suing their record label Warner Brothers over being marketed as such. Paul Meany stated {{in an interview in}} 2006 that if his previous band Earthsuit (a Christian act) [...] "inspired anything, it was what not to do." [...] Drummer Darren King has also stated that he does not consider the band to be Christian. While Armistice explored themes of doubt and pessimism that the band has {{gone so far as to}} call [...] "atheistic," [...] Meany stated that the idea for the album Odd Soul was [...] "loosely based on our upbringing in what <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call eccentric Christianity," [...] and King further explained that they wanted to celebrate [...] "their weird religious roots." [...] Rolling Stone has also noted this connection, calling them [...] "kinda sorta a Christian rock band." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{there no}} one else who could do that?" [...] Acton asked. [...] "It seems to me there's {{nothing wrong with that}} man Gordon. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> leave it to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hulton made {{a sign of}} agreement. [...] "That's so. I reckon <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do {{a bigger}} trade than you {{have the money to}} handle. However, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> and Featherstone mean to {{continue}} the partnership?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You can use mine, Bab; you've {{got such}} a strong fist, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> pull it," [...] added Ben, remembering {{that it would not}} be amiss to have a comrade who shot worse than he did, for he felt very {{inferior}} to Thorny in many ways, and, being used to praise, had missed it very much since he retired to private life.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is so,' the man agreed. 'A good mate {{makes all}} the {{difference}} in life out here. It is easy to see the young 'un thinks a heap of you, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> reckon on him if you got into a tight corner. He is a tough-looking chap, too. Well, I reckon the meat's done. You had better give a call for your mate. Where has he gone to?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{some time}} I'll tell you. But look here, Mr. Westover, I wish if mother gets {{to talking about}} me with you that you'd let her know how I feel. We can't talk together, she and I, without quarrelling about it; but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> put in a word that would show her I wasn't quite a fool. She thinks I've gone crazy from seeing {{the way they do}} things in Europe; that I'm {{conceited}} and unpatriotic, and I don't know what all." [...] Jeff laughed as if with an inner fondness for his mother's wrong-headedness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly. We'll {{take the}} last {{question}} first. Somebody tore off a shutter and we carried <b>you</b> on it. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know you got a dago's knife between your ribs." ...|$|R

6000|$|He {{stopped a}} moment, {{and looked at}} Jimmy with a {{whimsical}} twinkle in his eyes. [...] "Now, I don't know any reason why you shouldn't come {{if you feel like}} it. You seem reasonably sober, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be civil. Charterers aren't quite so trying here as one would fancy they are in the Old Country. I've been there; but on the Pacific Slope we haven't yet branded the people who work as quite outside the pale. You could put on the steamboat jacket, and I've an old man-o'-war cap with gold letters on it. The man who left it on board the Sorata privately discharged himself from one of the Pacific squadron. It was a dark night, and he was almost drowned when I got him. Well, it would bring you twelve dollars a week, all found--it's what I'd have to pay another man--besides being a favor to me." ...|$|E

5000|$|McBride states: I'm {{proud of}} my Jewish history....Technically <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say I'm Jewish since my mother was Jewish...but she {{converted}} (to Christianity).

5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{less than a}} week before the Falling Down's release, screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith gave his interpretation of what the movie was about. [...] "To me, even though the movie deals with complicated urban issues, it really is just about one basic thing: The main character represents the old power structure of the U.S. that has now become archaic, and hopelessly lost. And that way, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say D-FENS is like Los Angeles. For both of them, it's adjust-or-die time..." ...|$|E
