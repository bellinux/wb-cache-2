25|$|The {{overlapping}} ranges with <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> {{mean that}} 24 or 27 speed <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> may {{only have the}} same total gear range as a (much more expensive) Rohloff 14-speed hub gear. Internal hub geared bikes typically have a more restricted gear range than comparable derailleur-equipped bikes, and have fewer ratios within that range.|$|E
25|$|A single-speed bicycle {{is a type}} of bicycle with {{a single}} gear ratio. These {{bicycles}} are without <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears,</b> hub gearing or other methods for varying the gear ratio of the bicycle. Adult single-speed bicycles typically have a gear ratio of between 55 and 75 gear inches, depending on the rider and the anticipated usage.|$|E
25|$|Further {{innovations}} increased {{comfort and}} {{ushered in a}} second bicycle craze, the 1890s Golden Age of Bicycles. In 1888, Scotsman John Boyd Dunlop introduced the first practical pneumatic tire, which soon became universal. Soon after, the rear freewheel was developed, enabling the rider to coast. This refinement led to the 1890s invention of coaster brakes. <b>Dérailleur</b> <b>gears</b> and hand-operated Bowden cable-pull brakes were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders.|$|E
50|$|While at the Tour de France {{road race}} in France in 1994, the Rohloffs went bicycling {{on the beach}} in France. The bikes got stuck in the sand, and the {{primitive}} <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> systems would not work. This triggered Bernhard Rohloff to develop a new internally geared hub.|$|R
5000|$|Hub gears {{are sealed}} within the hub, which protects them from water, grit, and impacts. Thus hub gears usually require less {{maintenance}} {{and can be}} more reliable over time than comparable external <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> systems, which may require more adjustments and replacement of parts (front chainrings, rear sprockets, narrow derailleur-chain).|$|R
50|$|Bicycles {{without a}} {{straight}} chainline are slightly less efficient due to frictional losses incurred by running the chain {{at an angle}} between the front chainring and rear sprocket. This {{is the main reason}} that a single-speed bicycle can be more efficient than a <b>derailleur</b> <b>geared</b> bicycle. Single-speed bicycles should have the straightest possible chainline.|$|R
2500|$|A cyclist's legs produce power optimally {{within a}} narrow {{pedalling}} speed range, or cadence. Gearing can be optimized {{to use this}} narrow range as efficiently as possible. As in other types of transmissions, the gear ratio {{is closely related to}} the mechanical advantage of the drivetrain of the bicycle. On single-speed bicycles and multi-speed bicycles using <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears,</b> the gear ratio depends on the ratio of the number of teeth on the chainring to the number of teeth on the rear sprocket (cog). [...] For bicycles equipped with hub gears, the gear ratio also depends on the internal planetary gears within the hub. For a shaft-driven bicycle the gear ratio depends on the bevel gears used {{at each end of the}} shaft.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, spurred by Americans' {{increasing}} {{consciousness of the}} value of exercise and later the advantage of energy efficient transportation led to the American bike boom of the 1970s. [...] Annual U.S. sales of adult bicycles doubled between 1960 and 1970, and doubled again between 1971 and 1975, the peak years of the adult cycling boom in the United States, eventually reaching nearly 17 million units. [...] Most of these sales were to new cyclists, who overwhelmingly preferred models imitating popular European derailleur-equipped racing bikes [...] variously called sports models, sport/tourers, or simply ten-speeds [...] to the older roadsters with hub gears which remained much the same as they had been since the 1930s. These lighter bicycles, long used by serious cyclists and by racers, featured dropped handlebars, narrow tires, <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears,</b> five to fifteen speeds, and a narrow 'racing' type saddle. By 1980, racing and sport/touring derailleur bikes dominated the market in North America.|$|E
2500|$|Wildwood is more soft fantasy than hard fantasy, in that {{historical}} and technological consistency and plausibility {{are not a}} high priority, giving the book a whimsical, or stream of consciousness, tone. The factions of The Wood {{use a variety of}} anachronistic technologies, including cutlasses, blunderbusses, and flintlocks, concurrent with howitzers and semi-automatic pistols, and vehicles like animal-drawn wagons and carts alongside bicycles, trucks and trains. No attempt was made to maintain a consistent level of technological advancement or to rationalize why a particular piece of equipment was used; rather, Meloy said, they could [...] "pick coolest version of whatever piece of technology" [...] they wanted, and Ellis said they [...] "just picked whatever we liked." [...] When she first meets the South Wood postman Richard, he threatens her with a shotgun, which in the same paragraph is referred to as a double-barrelled rifle, then on the next page it is called a shotgun again. Though the text pointedly mentions Prue's single-speed bicycle, the illustrations twice show her bike having <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears,</b> which are only present on multi-speed bikes.|$|E
50|$|The League reorganized {{once again}} in 1965. By this time, {{highways}} had improved, the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System had drained traffic from many of them, and new interest in recreational cycling was spurred by the promotion of sports bicycles with <b>derailleur</b> <b>gearing</b> by the Schwinn Bicycle Company and others. Increasing awareness {{of the importance of}} physical fitness also contributed to the popularity of bicycling.|$|R
50|$|The SRAM i-Motion {{series of}} {{products}} is a sport, urban, and trekking oriented product series developed and manufactured by SRAM Corporation. Branded i-Motion are internally geared hubs, shift levers, and dynamo hubs. Related to the i-Motion series are also changeable free or fixed single speed hubs, hybrid epicyclic and <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> hubs, and hydraulic disc brakes. The i-Motion series of products were developed at SRAMs Schweinfurt R&D and manufacturing plant in Germany, formerly of Sachs.|$|R
50|$|Patents for {{built-in}} {{systems to}} change gear ratios appeared as early as 1890. Adler offered a three-speed gearbox bicycle in the 1930s. Several attempts to develop gearbox bicycles during the 2000s for downhill racing, such as the Honda RN-01 G-cross, incorporated complete <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> drive trains in an enclosure. Around the same time Schlumpf Innovations and Hammerschmidt offered cranksets with two different gear ratios and just one chainring. Pinion launched their spur-gear system in the 2010s.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} Seventies, {{two groups of}} enthusiasts: the Larkspur Canyon Gang, from Larkspur (long-time speed-riders down Mount Tamalpais), and later members of Velo-Club Tamalpais from Fairfax and San Anselmo in Marin County, California began group rides in the canyons and over ridges, {{up and down the}} fireroads around Mount Tamalpais, later racing bikes {{downhill}} in a race they called [...] "Repack" [...] because the ride was so grueling that riders had to repack their coaster brakes with grease after each run. The off-road terrain was rocky and the steep mountainside helped riders attain high speeds as they bounced and slammed over rocks and mud. Such harsh treatment caused regular road bikes to crumble, so the racers searched for a more durable and affordable alternative. They soon discovered that old balloon-tired [...] "clunkers" [...] (as they called them) could be had for $5.00 at a garage sale and would endure tremendous punishment. Soon, riders were snapping up these old cruisers, stripping off the heavy fenders and trim, and souped them up to improve downhill performance. <b>Derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> were added by Russ Mahon of [...] The Morrow Dirt Club in Cupertino at the 1974 Marin County cyclo-cross and Gary Fisher's 1975 used a tandem rear hub (from a flea market) with internal steel drum brake and threaded for a freewheel derailleur cluster to his old Schwinn Excelsior bike, enabling him to ride up the mountain, as well as down. About the same time, another rider named Joe Breeze began tinkering with his own Schwinn Excelsior, making it more suited to the [...] "Repack" [...] course. Soon, both of them began to build and sell custom mountain bikes to fellow enthusiasts, launching a worldwide cycling phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|In 1995, Sachs {{introduced}} the Elan, the first hub gear with 12 speeds, and an overall range of 339%. Three years later, Rohloff {{came out with}} the Speedhub 500/14, a gear hub with 14 speeds and a range of 526%, comparable to that of a 27 speed <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> system, and also sufficiently robust and lightweight for mountain biking. In 2007, NuVinci started manufacturing continuously variable transmission ("stepless") ∞-speed hubs for commuter bicycles, with an increasing range of about 380% (2016).|$|R
50|$|Inter 8 - The Inter 8 has {{interval}} percentages {{between the}} gears of 22,16,14,18,22,16,14, {{and a total}} range of 307%, comparable to a road bike <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> systems, but as the other Nexus products, it is designed and intended for urban commuter use. The hub comes {{in a variety of}} versions, weighing between 1550 and 2040 grams stripped. The newest high end models are internally very similar to the Alfine model. The Inter 8 is more tolerant of shifting under load than the Inter 7.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} a freehub was devised and {{manufactured}} by British company Bayliss-Wiley in 1938 and won the Cyclists Touring Club (CTC) award for that year. On the Bayliss-Wiley design the freewheel unit was threaded to accept the sprockets. A different four speed design was manufactured by BSA Cycles Ltd in 1949 to accompany their BSA 4 Star <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear.</b> The BSA design had a splined freewheel unit (BSA part No.8-1913) which attached to the hub shell (BSA part No.8-701) and carried four sprockets.|$|R

Internal hub geared bikes typically have a more restricted gear range than comparable derailleur-equipped bikes, and have fewer ratios within that range.|$|E
50|$|The Speedhub is more {{expensive}} than competing bicycle gear systems (both hub gears and <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears),</b> and it is about 500 to 1,000 grams heavier than a set of <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears,</b> but it offers the gear range of <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> (and at its ratio of 5.26:1 more range than a typical road bike ratio of 4.28:1 with 50/34 chainrings and 11 to 32 tooth cassette) while requiring significantly less maintenance and having a longer service life. It is therefore mainly used in expensive touring bicycles and in mountain bikes, where its lack of (vulnerable) external components is useful.|$|E

2500|$|BSA {{produced}} the first Sunbeam bicycle catalogue in 1949 and produced its own '4 Star' <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> with an associated splined cassette hub and 4 sprocket cassette. [...] This design {{was different from}} the 1930s Bayliss Wiley cassette hub which had a threaded sprocket carrier. [...] BSA bought New Hudson motorcycle and bicycle business in 1950 and followed this up in 1951 with the purchase of [...] Triumph Motorcycles which brought Jack Sangster onto the BSA board. The effect of this acquisition was to make BSA into the largest producer of [...] motorcycles in the world at that time.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} paraplegics and other individuals {{with little or}} no use of their legs, many manufacturers have designed and released hand-powered recumbent trikes, or handcycles. Handcycles are a regular sight at HPV meetings and are beginning to be seen on the streets. They usually follow a delta design with front wheels driven by standard <b>dérailleur</b> <b>gearing</b> powered by hand cranks. Brake levers are usually mounted on the hand holds, which are usually set with no offset rather than the 180° of pedal cranks. The entire crank assembly and the front wheel turn together, allowing the rider to steer and crank simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Many {{manufacturers}} have designed and released hand-powered recumbent trikes, or handcycles. Handcycles are a regular sight at HPV meets and {{are beginning to}} {{be seen on the}} streets. They commonly follow a delta design with front wheels driven by standard <b>derailleur</b> <b>gearing</b> powered by hand cranks.

This allows the rider to more easily use their torso to help propel the cycle. The entire crank assembly and the front wheel turn together, allowing the rider to steer and crank simultaneously.|$|R

50|$|<b>Derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> {{generally}} have an efficiency around 95%; a few percentage {{points higher than}} other gear types.|$|E
50|$|At commuter/recreational power levels, current hub gears are {{typically}} about 2% less efficient than reasonably maintained <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} characteristics about a racing bicycle are its weight and stiffness which determine the efficiency {{at which the}} power from a rider's pedal strokes can {{be transferred to the}} drive-train and subsequently to its wheels. To this effect racing bicycles may sacrifice comfort for speed. The drop handlebars are positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic posture. The front and back wheels are close together so the bicycle has quick handling. The <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear</b> ratios are closely spaced so that the rider can pedal at their optimum cadence. Other racing bicycles, especially those used in time trialling, prioritize aerodynamics over comfort.|$|R
50|$|The {{commuter}} bike is {{a hybrid}} {{designed specifically for}} commuting over short or long distances. It typically features <b>derailleur</b> <b>gearing,</b> 700c wheels with fairly light 1.125 inch (28 mm) tires, a carrier rack, full fenders, and a frame with suitable mounting points for attachment of various load-carrying baskets or panniers. It sometimes, though not always, has an enclosed chainguard to allow a rider to pedal the bike in long pants without entangling them in the chain. A well-equipped commuter bike typically features front and rear lights {{for use in the}} early morning or late evening hours encountered at the start or end of a business day.|$|R
5000|$|What sets {{it apart}} from most other {{bicycles}} {{is the fact}} that it was developed specifically for race use by the Honda team using many purpose made components not commercially available. It is also different in that it uses an internal gearbox instead of external (<b>derailleur)</b> <b>gearing</b> system, which although not unique to this bicycle, is quite rare. The gearbox on the RN-01 is specific because it is not a classic gearbox like the Rohloff Speedhub for instance. Inside the gearbox there is a classic derailleur, a cassette and a chainring. The freewheel is not placed on the rear wheel but in the bottom bracket so the chain is constantly moving when the back wheel is spinning, a [...] "front freewheel" [...] system. This allows the rider to shift gears without pedaling.|$|R

50|$|Randonneuring {{has much}} in common with cyclotouring, the founding-father of which is often said to be the {{journalist}} Velocio (Paul de Vivie), also credited with making <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> popular.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{a modern}} bicycle frame {{intended}} for <b>derailleur</b> <b>gears</b> {{will have a}} vertical dropout, while one designed for singlespeed or hub gears will have horizontal dropouts or track fork ends.|$|E
50|$|In 1906, the ACP {{gave the}} job of organising brevet rides - so called after the card, or brevet, that riders had signed along the route to show they had ridden the {{distance}} - to Desgrange. There came a row, however, that led Desgrange {{to take over the}} Audax movement for himself. The first reason was that the ACP ran an event called the Polymultipliée de Chanteloup, one of several competitions popular at the time to show whether a <b>derailleur</b> <b>gear,</b> then not in wide use, or a single gear was superior over a range of courses. The ACP formed a partnership for its competition with LEcho des Sports, a rival to Desgranges LAuto. The second reason was that the road captains were accused of no longer respecting the 18 km/h average demanded by the rules.|$|R
25|$|As {{a general}} rule, fixed-gear {{bicycles}} are single-speed. A <b>derailleur</b> for <b>gear</b> selection would introduce chain slack, which {{would interfere with}} braking. Gear selection can, however, be accomplished {{with the use of}} an internally geared hub. For example, a Sturmey-Archer fixed-gear 3-speed hub is a fixed-gear multi-speed arrangement. Most fixed-gear bicycles only have a front brake, and some have no brakes at all.|$|R
25|$|Automatic {{transmissions}} {{have been}} demonstrated and marketed for both <b>derailleur</b> and hub <b>gear</b> mechanisms, often accompanied by a warning to disengage auto-shifting if standing on the pedals. These have met with limited market success.|$|R
