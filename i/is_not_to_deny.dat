But this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> that Hordern's simian habit of scratching his left earlobe with right hand or leaning over his desk {{as if he is}} doing intellectual press-ups is very funny to watch or that he is brilliant at displaying cuckolded curiosity." [...] Harold Hobson, the drama critic, thought that failing to enjoy the play was [...] "not actually a criminal offence but it is a sad evidence of illiteracy". Jumpers won the Evening Standard 's Best Play Award which, much to Hordern's amusement, was presented by the philosopher A. J. Ayer.|$|E
2500|$|... "Irresistible grace", {{also called}} [...] "efficacious grace", {{asserts that the}} saving grace of God is effectually applied to those whom he has {{determined}} to save (that is, the elect) and overcomes their resistance to obeying {{the call of the}} gospel, bringing them to a saving faith. This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual certainly will be saved. The doctrine holds that this purposeful influence of God's Holy Spirit cannot be resisted, but that the Holy Spirit, [...] "graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ." [...] This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> the fact that the Spirit's outward call (through the proclamation of the Gospel) can be, and often is, rejected by sinners; rather, it's that inward call which cannot be rejected.|$|E
2500|$|Underlying {{the concept}} of [...] "mind uploading" [...] (more {{accurately}} [...] "mind transferring") is the broad philosophy that consciousness lies within the brain's information processing and is in essence an emergent feature that arises from large neural network high-level patterns of organization, and that the same patterns of organization can be realized in other processing devices. Mind uploading also relies {{on the idea that}} the human mind (the [...] "self" [...] and the long-term memory), just like non-human minds, is represented by the current neural network paths and the weights of the brain synapses rather than by a dualistic and mystic soul and spirit. The mind or [...] "soul" [...] can be defined as the information state of the brain, and is immaterial only in the same sense as the information content of a data file or the state of a computer software currently residing in the work-space memory of the computer. Data specifying the information state of the neural network can be captured and copied as a [...] "computer file" [...] from the brain and re-implemented into a different physical form. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> that minds are richly adapted to their substrates. An analogy to the idea of mind uploading is to copy the temporary information state (the variable values) of a computer program from the computer memory to another computer and continue its execution. The other computer may perhaps have different hardware architecture but emulates the hardware of the first computer.|$|E

He has found something to make him laugh, and he will not suffer it to make him think. And the remedy is not to unsay what he has said, not even, so to speak, to unlaugh what he has laughed, not to deny {{that there is something}} unique and curious about this American inquisition into our abstract opinions, but rather to continue the train of thought, and follow the admirable advice of Mr. H. G. Wells, who said, 'It is not much good thinking of a thing unless you think it out.' It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> that American officialism is rather peculiar on this point, but to inquire what it really is which makes America peculiar, or which is peculiar to America. In short, it is to get some ultimate idea of what America is; and {{the answer to that question}} will reveal something much deeper and grander and more worthy of our intelligent interest.|$|E
60|$|Nor, finally, {{can they}} know the truths which the error thus {{prolonged}} has hindered from coming to the birth. A strenuous disputant has recently asserted against me that 'the region of the might have been lies {{beyond the limits of}} sane speculation.'[12] It in surely extending optimism too far to insist on carrying it back right through the ages. To me at any rate the history of mankind is a huge pis-aller, just as our present society is; a prodigious wasteful experiment, from which a certain number of precious results have been extracted, but which is not now, nor ever has been at any other time, a final measure of all the possibilities of the time. This is not inconsistent with the scientific conception of history; it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> the great law that society has a certain order of progress; but only to urge that within that, the only possible order, there is always room for all kinds and degrees of invention, improvement, and happy or unhappy accident. There is no discoverable law fixing precisely the more or the less of these; nor how much of each of them a community shall meet with, nor exactly when it shall meet with them. We have to distinguish between possibility and necessity. Only certain steps in advance are possible at a given time; but it is not inevitable that those potential advances should all be realised. Does anybody suppose that humanity has had the profit of all the inventive and improving capacity born into the world? That Turgot, for example, was the only man that ever lived who might have done more for society than he was allowed to do, and spared society a cataclysm? No,--history is a pis-aller. It has assuredly not moved without the relation of cause and effect; it is a record of social growth and its conditions; {{but it is also a}} record of interruption and misadventure and perturbation. You trace the long chain which has made us what we are in this aspect and that. But where are the dropped links that might have made all the difference? Ubi sunt eorum tabulae qui post vota nuncupate perierunt? Where is the fruit of those multitudinous gifts which came into the world in untimely seasons? We accept the past for the same reason that we accept the laws of the solar system, though, as Comte says, 'we can easily conceive them improved in certain respects.' The past, like the solar system, is beyond reach of modification at our hands, and we cannot help it. But it is surely the mere midsummer madness of philosophic complacency to think that we have come by the shortest and easiest of all imaginable routes to our present point in the march; to suppose that we have wasted nothing, lost nothing, cruelly destroyed nothing, on the road. What we have lost is all in the region of the 'might have been,' and we are justified in taking this into account, and thinking much of it, and in trying to find causes for the loss. One of them has been want of liberty for the human intelligence; and another, to return to our proper subject, has been the prolonged existence of superstition, of false opinions, and of attachment to gross symbols, beyond the time when they might have been successfully attacked, and would have fallen into decay but for the mistaken political notion of their utility. In making a just estimate of this utility, if we see reason to believe that these false opinions, narrow superstitions, gross symbols, have been an impediment to the free exercise of the intelligence and a worthier culture of the emotions, then we are justified in placing the unknown loss as a real and most weighty item in the account against them.|$|E

50|$|For Giegerich, {{psychology}} has no proper goal {{other than}} understanding and insight. Any approach motivated by practical concerns, {{such as those}} relating to personal development or even creating a better world, though of undeniable concern to human beings, are regarded as lying outside the true discipline of psychology which is concerned only with the ways that the structure of thought have and continue to evolve through history, in other words, with the logical movement of the soul. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> the importance of human concerns but rather places them outside the discipline of psychology, perhaps more properly in an anthropological framework.|$|E

5000|$|The post-cognitive, {{interactional}} {{approach to}} affective computing departs from the Picardian research program in three ways: First, it adopts {{a notion of}} emotion as constituted in social interaction. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> that emotion has biophysical aspects, but it is to underline that emotion is [...] "culturally grounded, dynamically experienced, {{and to some degree}} constructed in action and interaction".Second, the interactional approach does not seek to enhance the affect-processing capacities of computer systems. Rather, it seeks to help [...] " ... people to understand and experience their own emotions".Third, the interactional approach accordingly adopts different design and evaluation strategies than those described by the Picardian research program. Interactional affective design supports open-ended, (inter-)individual processes of affect interpretation. It recognizes the context-sensitive, subjective, changing and possibly ambiguous character of affect interpretation. And it takes into account that these sense-making efforts and affect itself may resist a computational formalization.|$|E

According to Gagan, the {{objective}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> indigent patients access to hospital care, but to appeal to middle-class self-interest in order to spur statutory changes in government social policy that would explicitly recognize that hospitals were no longer charitable enterprises. Rather, hospitals had become centres for the scientific treatment of diseases among all classes for a fair price in relation to the value of the product and the ability of the consumer to pay for non-profit treatment. The OHA and hospitals wanted a shift from the traditional charitable role of hospitals, to one that was [...] "committed to scientific professionalism and recognized the realities of hospital economics".|$|R
5000|$|Instead {{of trying}} to {{construct}} a [...] "precise chronology" [...] of what [...] "really happened," [...] in the field, they aim to demonstrate how [...] "a hard fact can be sociologically deconstructed" [...] (107) by showing how it emerged in {{what they call a}} network. A network is [...] "a set of positions within which an object such as TRF has meaning" [...] (107), and they recognize that TRF only has meaning within certain networks. For example, outside of the network of post-1960s endocrinology, TRF is [...] "an unremarkable white powder" [...] (108), which leads to the claim that a [...] "well-established fact loses its meaning when divorced from its context" [...] (110). Latour and Woolgar stress that [...] "to say that TRF is constructed <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> its solidity as a fact.

5000|$|Many also criticize Julius II {{for having}} {{repeatedly}} identified himself with Julius Caesar. His desire to emulate Caesar and his extravagant patronage further the negative connotations. Scholars have drawn this conclusion from the medal Julius {{had made for}} Saint Peter's with himself on the back, {{as well as his}} self-chosen name of Julius. (Gosman, 44) The second, less common stance, is that Julius’s main motive for his patronage was for his own personal aesthetic pleasure (Gosman, 45). One scholar defends Julius II's patronage by stating: “It must not be forgotten that not all messages conveyed in works commissioned by a patron, let alone those merely addressed to him, can be read as a communication by the patron of his thinking and claims and aspirations. To say this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> that messages may be read into them, but it should not be assumed that patrons would necessarily have cared about or understood or been motivated by theories and statements about their power and authority that may be coded into the works of art they paid for".

5000|$|According to one critic, [...] "Boulezs works inhabit {{their own}} special soundworld". In Pli selon Pli he groups {{instruments}} in atypical ways. For example, [...] "The customary string section {{is not used}} for lyrical, cantabile melodies, but rather for sounds such as tremolos snapped pizzicati and other quasi-percussive effects." [...] At times, [...] "Three harps, mandolin and guitar are added to two pianos to form a plucked/struck string group." [...] Bells are used {{so as to avoid}} any association with religious ceremony. Instead [...] "their combination with other metal percussion creates for a unique sonority - quite peculiar to itself." [...] He described the orchestration as [...] "extraordinarily inventive, with sometimes a completely different timbre between one phrase - or even note - and the next." [...] John Rockwell recognized both the works innovations and its sources: [...] "as evident as the novelty of these pieces are their debts to other composers and other cultures-the Expressionist tensions of Schoenberg, the exuberant racket of Chinese percussion, above all the piercing aviary of Messiaen. Which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> Mr. Boulez his eagerly sought-after originality, merely to place it in context." ...|$|E
