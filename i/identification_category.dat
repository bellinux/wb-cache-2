Adequate preimplant counselling is mandatory, to prevent high expectations and to stress the necessity for bilateral implantation. Objective: In 60 % of patients with Cogan syndrome, CI remains the only treatment option. Literature data agree that once the electrode array is properly inserted, functional outcomes are very good. Nevertheless, results may deteriorate due to progressive cochlear ossification. A few studies have documented the outcomes of CI in these patients, but none have reported the long-term results. Methods: This was a retrospective study describing the outcomes of 3 implanted patients with Cogan syndrome – among 300 adult patients who received a cochlear implant, 3 had become deaf due to Cogan syndrome. Results: In one patient the cochlear ossification advanced and the speech perception abilities worsened from the highest category to identification of words in closed set. The second patient complained of an abrupt reduction of loudness at 18 months post-implant, which required an increased electrical stimulation.

40|$|The {{terrorist}} attack on the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001 represents a pivotal moment in the dynamic that shapes the explanatory and <b>identification</b> <b>category</b> of "the West" in a crisis of relationship with the "other" that {{has taken on the}} tone of a clash of civilizations. Within this scenario, the present work starts from the interpretation of the suicide terrorist as kamikaze to develop a reflection on the construction of the categories we/other in contemporary Western society. The image of the martyr who seeks - through the bomb that will destroy his earthly life - a road to paradise is an archaic paradox that still resonates in us, reduced to a simplified simulacrum, in itself sufficient to explain the absurdity of a gesture so powerfully destructive. The paradise of the suicide bomber assumes the function of a screen that allows us to distance ourselves from the other, confine him to a world totally alien, so different as to be driven by irrationality and inhumanity. In a society that is increasingly immune and saved from the negative, the image of paradise becomes a necessary filter to face the destructive event, avoiding the need to relate with it in an attempt to understand.  </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{multiple}} regression analysis of sequential effects in magnitude estimation and absolute identification is presented {{as an alternative to}} the approach used by Lockhead and his students. The new analysis indicates that sequential effects do not extend over more than one trial. This is in agreement with the response ratio hypothesis. A more detailed {{multiple regression}} analysis of these sequential effects indicates that the magnitude of the correlation between successive responses is heavily dependent on the decibel difference between successive signals. This is not in agreement with the response ratio hypothesis, and the hypothesis is reformulated to take account of this finding. This modification of the model is tested by comparing distributions of normalized responses to theoretical distributions suggested by the model and to a possible alternative distribution. Once one tries to examine more than the central tendency (mean, median, or geometric mean, as the case may be) of responses in absolute <b>identification,</b> <b>category,</b> or magnitude estimation procedures, one must not ignore the possibility that the responses have been contaminated by factors other than simple variability in the internal representations of the stimuli. Sequential effects and response drift are two such factors. We were led to the present study and analysis of these factors not because we were interested in them per se, but because they impeded our attempts to compare the distributions of responses in magnitude estimation with predictions derived from timing and counting models (Green & Luce, 1974; Luce & Green, 1972).

40|$|High-resolution (HR) MS {{instruments}} recording HR-full scan allow {{analysts to}} go further beyond pre-acquisition choices. Untargeted acquisition can reveal unexpected compounds or concentrations and can be performed for preliminary diagnosis attempt. Then, revealed compounds {{will have to be}} identified for interpretations. Whereas the need of reference standards is mandatory to confirm identification, the diverse information collected from HRMS allows identifying unknown compounds with relatively high degree of confidence without reference standards injected in the same analytical sequence. However, there is a necessity to evaluate the degree of confidence in putative identifications, possibly before further targeted analyses. This is why a confidence scale and a score in the identification of (non-peptidic) known-unknown, defined as compounds with entries in database, is proposed for (LC-) HRMS data. The scale is based on two representative documents edited by the European Commission (2007 / 657 /EC) and the Metabolomics Standard Initiative (MSI), in an attempt to build a bridge between the communities of metabolomics and screening labs. With this confidence scale, an identification (ID) score is determined as [a number, a letter, and a number] (e. g., 2 D 3), from the following three criteria: I, a General <b>Identification</b> <b>Category</b> (1, confirmed, 2, putatively identified, 3, annotated compounds/classes, and 4, unknown); II, a Chromatography Class based on the relative retention time (from the narrowest tolerance, A, to no chromatographic references, D); and III, an Identification Point Level (1, very high, 2, high, and 3, normal level) {{based on the number of}} identification points collected.

Lema Sabachtani, realizada em 1966, por Barnett Newman, assim como sobre a natureza desta associação e como ela pode ser abordada pela História da Arte, teórica e metodologicamente. Esta pesquisa trata, portanto, da espessura do olhar entre aquele que vê a obra de arte e a própria obra porque trata dos espaço-tempi em que sua percepção se abre a uma rede de relações. Diante de uma obra nos desfiguramos e reconfiguramos enquanto sua imagem se modifica. Mas quando a obra {{concerne}} a uma transformação exemplar, esses conteúdos de desdobram e se redobram em inúmeras questões, como é o caso do tema da transformação mais recorrente em nossa cultura cristã e ocidental, no grande drama expresso pela Paixão. O interesse por essas obras, portanto, foi imposta pela expressa categoria de identificação autoimpingida do artista com o tema, com o pathos do processo de criação e com a temporalidade complexa que a constelação dessas obras acaba por sedimentar. Assim, a investigação levou à reflexão sobre o impacto do jogo entre o pathos e o anacronismo sobre o discurso na História da Arte como montagem de tempos heterogêneos, baseada em pressupostos oferecidos por Aby Warburg, Walter Benjamin e Georges Didi-Huberman. _______________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe {{subject of}} this PhD research project is the association of Henri Matisse's Chemin de la Croix, Barnett Newman's Stations of the Cross. Lema Sabachtani Exhibition and Bené Fonteles' Sudários, {{as well as what}} the order of this association and how it can be brought up by Art History, theoretically and methodologically. Therefore, this research is about of the thickness of the outlook between the one who sees the artwork and the artwork itself, because it talks about the space-times in that perception that opens itself into a web of relations. In front of an artwork we desfigure and reconfigure ourselves as the image modifies. But when the artwork approaches to a model transformation, these contents unfold and refold themselves in numerous questions. That is the case of the more recurrent transformations in our Western Christian culture, in the great drama expressed by the Passion. The interest by these artworks, therefore, was imposed by the artist’s self-inflicted <b>identification</b> <b>category</b> with the subject, with the pathos of the creation process and with the complexity of the temporality that the constellation of these works deposits.

To address the issue, we have developed RARGen, a text mining-based approach based on well-established methods aiming to automatically create and maintain risk repositories to identify usable risk association rules (RARs) from a corpus of {{risk analysis}} documents. RARs are risks that have frequently occurred in historical projects. We evaluate RARGen on 20 publicly available e-service projects.

In this paper we show how one can use random aggregations of IP flows (i. e., sketches) to enable more precise identification of {{the underlying causes of}} anomalies.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Verify if late {{cochlear}} implantation allows pre-lingual deafs {{to convert}} from visual to oral communication mode only. METHOD: Thirteen pre-lingual profoundly deaf patients implanted the ages of 8 and 22 years {{were included in the}} study. Before cochlear implantation, none of the patients used the oral language. Six patients used cued speech and seven used the sign language to communicate. Evaluations were made with measures of hearing thresholds, phoneme <b>identification,</b> <b>categories</b> of auditory performance and rating of the intelligibility of speech before and after implantation. Changes in principal mode of communication (i. e. oral, cued speech or sign language) were also monitored. RESULTS: The former users of cued speech benefited significantly more from cochlear implantation than the sign language users for phoneme <b>identification</b> and <b>categories</b> of auditory performance, although all had similar hearing thresholds before and after cochlear implantation. After a mean implant use of 4. 5 years, four out of six cued speech users converted to exclusive use of the oral language, while only one out of seven former users of the sign language converted {{to the use of the}} oral language. DISCUSSION: It is possible for pre-lingual or congenital deafs to convert totally from a visual to an oral communication mode even in case of late cochlear implantation. Previous awareness of the structure of the oral language, even without hearing (e. g. via cued speech) influences positively the outcome of delayed implantations. We recommend the adoption of oral communication with the cued speech code in cases where a late cochlear implantation is envisioned...|$|R

BS animals were disproportionately represented among the BSE cases (BS represented about 9 % of the susceptible population but 27 % of actual cases). BS were slaughtered at a higher age (5. 8 years vs. 5. 0 years for other breeds), and there is a higher prevalence of feeding proprietary feeds to BS calves than calves from other breeds. There was no difference in the recorded feeding practice of BSE-positive animals from BS or other breeds. These results would lead to expect a higher prevalence of BSE in the BS population, with BS BSE animals being of equal age or older than BSE animals from other breeds. In contrast, median age at BSE detection was significantly lower in BS animals than in other breeds (61. 4 vs. 68. 8 months). There was no difference in the <b>identification</b> <b>categories</b> of BSE between BS animals and animals of other breeds that could explain this difference in age.

Despite this, present face recognition systems are not yet accurate or robust enough to be fully deployed in under-controlled yet high security environments. A number of works have investigated the impact of face categorization on recognition performance, {{in order to assess}} the hypothesis that a preliminary face categorization can be used to contain the search space during <b>identification.</b> <b>Categories</b> are usually related to soft-biometrics, such as gender, age, ethnicity. More features can also be used {{at the same time to}} define categories (e. g. gender and age). The underlying assumption is that, during identification operations, a sample image is only matched with those pertaining to the same category. Experimental results demonstrate that face categorization based on important visual characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, and age generally improve recognition accuracy, while reducing operation time. On the other hand, it is difficult to appropriately set up related experiments, since available datasets are not organized according to any categorization. Moreover, it is often the case that some features (e. g. ethnicity or gender) are not uniformly represented. For instance, the ethnicity of the research group gathering a dataset, and therefore the location where the enrollment operations are performed, often influences the prevailing ethnical composition of the dataset. As a further example, since most datasets are gathered by enrolling volunteer students, the prevailing age range in most datasets is 20 - 35. Our contribution relies in an automatic procedure to build a larger multi-racial database, starting from the most popular among the available ones, which automatically reproduces the ethnicity/gender/age categorization that we manually performed in our lab. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R
