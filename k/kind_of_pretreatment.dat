One of the crucial steps in the ethanol production is the hydrolysis of the hemicellulose and cellulose to monomer sugars. In order to make the raw material accessible to the enzymes some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>pretreatment</b> is necessary. During the last ten years a large number of pretreatment methods have been developed. White rot fungi has the capability to separate the cellulose and hemicelluloses component from the complex lignin.

30|$|Woody biomass is {{widespread}} renewable resource, {{and quite a}} large volume has been accumulated. A growing focus of research concerns the production of bioethanol from woody biomass, due to its immense potential as an alternative fuel that does not compete with food. Given Japan’s large forest area and the ratio of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) in artificial planted forests, promoting the effective utilization of sugi should be a weighty subject [1]. A large portion of forests planted mainly during the 1950 s and 1960 s have {{reached the age of}} maturity [2]. And the conversion process of lignocellulosic materials via enzymatic saccharification generally needs some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>pretreatment</b> to increase the saccharification yield for a more effective production of fermentable sugars [3, 4]. Alkaline pretreatment causes hemicellulose and some lignin to solubilize, and the removal of both has a positive effect on the degradability of residual pulp. Oxygen delignification in alkaline solutions has also been reported as an effective technique of further removing residual lignin from pulp and thereby improving the saccharification yield [5, 6].|$|E
40|$|Second-generation {{bioethanol}} {{produced from}} various lignocellulosic materials, such as wood, agricultural or forest residues, {{has the potential}} to be a valuable substitute for, or a complement to, gasoline. One of the crucial steps in the ethanol production is the hydrolysis of the hemicellulose and cellulose to monomer sugars. The most promising method for hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose is by use of enzymes, i. e. cellulases. However, in order to make the raw material accessible to the enzymes some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>pretreatment</b> is necessary. During the last few years a large number of pretreatment methods have been developed, comprising methods working at low pH, i. e. acid based, medium pH (without addition of catalysts), and high pH, i. e. with a base as catalyst. Many methods have been shown to result in high sugar yields, above 90 % of theoretical for agricultural residues, especially for corn stover. For more recalcitrant materials, e. g. softwood, acid hydrolysis and steam pretreatment with acid catalyst seem to be the methods that can be used to obtain high sugar and ethanol yields. However, for more accurate comparison of different pretreatment methods it is necessary to improve the assessment methods under real process conditions. The whole process must be considered when a performance evaluation is to be made, as the various pretreatment methods give different types of materials. (Hemicellulose sugars can be obtained either in the liquid as monomer or oligomer sugars, or in the solid material to various extents; lignin can be either in the liquid or remain in the solid part; the composition and amount/concentration of possible inhibitory compounds also vary.) This will affect how the enzymatic hydrolysis should be performed(e. g. with or without hemicellulases), how the lignin is recovered and also the use of the lignin co-product...|$|E
30|$|The United States {{regulation}} requires by 2020 {{the production}} of 36 billion gallons of biofuels and from these, 21 billion should be produced from lignocellulosic materials or other new advanced fuels [4]. Agro-industrial waste (i.e., CGT) {{is one of the}} most significant sources of lignocellulosic materials, and bio-ethanol {{is one of the most}} essential bio-fuels produced from this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> wastes. In general, bio-ethanol production from lignocellulosic material includes three principal steps: 1) pretreatment, 2) saccharification, and 3) fermentation. To produce bioethanol from agro-industrial feedstocks, different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>pretreatments</b> have been investigated. These are generally divided into physical, physicochemical, chemical, and biological [5].

40|$|Emissions of insufficiently treated {{wastewater}}, mainly blackwater (i. e. wastewater from toilets), {{contributes to}} the eutrophication of lakes and seas. At the same time, blackwater is a fraction with a low content of heavy metals and, after sanitization, it can recirculate plant nutrients to arable land using the liquid composting treatment method. Liquid composting means that organic material is degraded under aerobic conditions. For sanitization, the blackwater needs to be treated together with energy-rich complementary material. A requirement for the sanitization in a liquid compost is that the substrate is energy rich, that the energy content is high enough and that the material is well dispersed and pumpable. The aim of this master thesis has been to find appropriate complementary material for treating blackwater in the wet compost treatment plant located in Karby, Norrtälje municipality, Sweden. An inventory {{was made of the}} organic waste produced in Norrtälje municipality and two nearby municipalities. Samples of the organic waste were collected and analysed for dry matter (as an indicator of energy content), plant nutrients, heavy metals and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 7). The suitability and availability of different organic waste fractions as complementary material was decided upon analyses results, calculations of estimated amounts of organic waste as well as some assumptions. Food waste is a relative clean fraction with a high energy content {{that would be a good}} complementary material for liquid composting. Fruit, vegetables and bread from stores are also clean fractions, but the availability is uncertain and depends on different factors. Based on results from this project, grease from grease trap is an uncertain fraction that is not recommended for complementary material for the liquid compost. The results show that Norrtälje municipality has enough organic waste to make it possible to use the whole capacity of the liquid compost plant in the future and to treat larger quantities of blackwater than today. The quantities of blackwater that can be treated are uncertain because a number of assumptions have been made and also because availability varies between different fractions of organic waste. Before it will be possible to add new organic waste fractions and more black water into the liquid compost plant, some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>pretreatment</b> plant is needed...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{environmental}} performance of nanocellulose, which is a bio-based nanomaterial. Being stronger than steel, biodegradable, transparent, and antibacterial, many potential applications of nanocellulose exist, including composites and films. Global production is steadily increasing, and there are three main types of nanocellulose: (1) Nano-fibrillated cellulose (NFC), which consists of long, spaghetti-like fibers, (2) nano-crystalline cellulose (NCC), which consists of rice-shaped nanoparticles, and (3) bacterial nano cellulose (BNC), which is produced by bacteria. Of these three, NFC and NCC are currently the most produced ones. Many concerns have been raised regarding the high energy use from producing NFC from wood by disintegration of the cellulose fibers. In response to this, a number of production routes involving some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>pretreatment</b> to facilitate disintegration have been developed. We assessed three routes for NFC production: (1) no pretreatment, (2) the enzymatic production route, where pulp is pretreated by enzymes to facilitate disintegration, and (3) the carboxymethylation production route, where the pulp is pretreated with polyelectrolytes to facilitate disintegration. The routes were assessed with regard to their cradle-to-gate life cycle energy use with a functional unit of 1 kg NFC. Preliminary results show that the enzymatic route required approximately 80 - 100 MJ/kg, whereas the carboxymethylation route requires approximately 1000 MJ/kg. The route without pretreatment required approximately 200 - 400 MJ/kg. Notably, the carboxymethylation route had a much higher life cycle energy use than the believed-to-be energy intensive no pretreatment route. This is because the carboxymethylation route requires a large amount of fossil energy in the form of fossil input materials for various purposes. The results illustrate the value of a life cycle perspective when the production of new materials is planned. Comparing these energy use results to that of other nanomaterials as reported in the literature, such as carbon nanotubes and fullerenes (~ 1000 - 100000 MJ/kg) and traditional materials such as aluminium (~ 200 MJ/kg) and polypropylene (~ 100 MJ/kg) suggest that enzymatic NFC has a very low energy use. Suggestions for improvements are provided in the presentation, and implications for further upscaling are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of anaerobic digestion technology is growing worldwide, {{mainly because of}} its environmental benefits. Nevertheless, anaerobic degradation is a rather slow and sensitive process. One {{of the reasons is}} the recalcitrance nature of certain fractions of the substrate (e. g., lignocelluloses) used for microbial degradation; thus, the hydrolysis becomes the rate-limiting step. The other reason is that the degradation of organic matter is based on a highly dynamic, multi-step process of physicochemical and biochemical reactions. The reactions take place in a sequential and parallel way under symbiotic interrelation of a variety of anaerobic microorganisms, which all together make the process sensitive. The first stage of the decomposition of the organic matter is performed by fast growing (hydrolytic and acid forming) microorganisms, while in the second stage the organic acids produced are metabolized by the slow growing methanogens, which are more sensitive than the acidogens; thus, methanogenesis becomes the rate-limiting step. The first part of this work evaluates the effects of a pretreatment using an organic solvent, N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO), on cellulose-based materials in order to overcome the challenge of biomass recalcitrance and to increase the rate of the hydrolysis. NMMO-pretreatment of straw separated from the cattle and horse manure resulted in increased methane yields, by 53 % and 51 %, respectively, in batch digestion tests. The same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>pretreatment</b> of the forest residues led to an increase by 141 % in the methane production during the following batch digestion assays. The second part of this work evaluates the efficacy of a two-stage process to overcome the second challenge with methanogenesis as the rate-limiting step, by using CSTR (continuous stirred tank reactors) and UASB (up flow anaerobic sludge blanket) {{on a wide variety of}} different waste fractions in order to decrease the time needed for the digestion process. In the two-stage semi-continuous process, the NMMO-pretreatment of jeans increased the biogas yield due to a more efficient hydrolysis compared to that of the untreated jeans. The results indicated that a higher organic loading rate (OLR) and a lower retention time could be achieved if the material was easily degradable. Comparing the two-stage and the single-stage process, treating the municipal solid waste (MSW) and waste from several food processing industries (FPW), showed that the OLR could be increased from 2 gVS/l/d to 10 gVS/l /d, and at the same time the HRT could be decreased from 10 to 3 days, which is a significant improvement that could be beneficial from an industrial point of view. The conventional single stage, on the other hand, could only handle an OLR of 3 gVS/l/d and HRT of 7 days...|$|E

Decrystallization was also realized by grinding cellulose in a planetary ball mill. The resulting amorphous intermediates were characterized by Raman spect roscopy.

Before pack chromization, two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>pretreatment</b> processes including the Ni electroplating and the Ni electroplating, followed by Cr-C electroplating {{were used to}} activate the steel surface. The additional Cr-C electroplating promotes the chromization rate, resulting in a thicker chromized coating (1045 -Ni-CrC-Cr(700 - 2)) with higher carbides and nitrides contents. The 1045 -Ni-CrC-Cr(700 - 2) specimen shows the lowest corrosion current density, 8. 37 × 10 - 8 Acm- 2, and the smallest interfacial contact resistance, 14 mΩ-cm 2, at 140 Ncm − 2 among all tested steels.

40|$|Water quality {{deterioration}} is {{a common}} phenomenon that may limit the recovery of injected water during aquifer storage and recovery (ASR). Quality deterioration is often caused by the oxidation of reduced aquifer components by oxygenated source water, the subsequent pH decline, and induced dissolution of carbonate minerals. We use a previously calibrated reactive transport model (PHREEQC) to optimize ASR depending on source water quality and <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>pretreatment.</b> We give quantitative projections on the performance increase over successive cycles with respect to specific water quality indicators. We simulate the response of a representative, deeply anoxic aquifer upon injection of three different commonly applied oxygenated water types: pre-treated drinking water, desalinated seawater, and urban storm water. The model is coupled to a Python script that automatically stops recovery and starts the next injection phase when certain specified concentration thresholds are exceeded. This setup enables realistic simulations to gradually create a buffer zone around the ASR well that allows 100 % recovery at a specific stage of aquifer development. Each source water type was associated with different issues causing {{the deterioration of the}} abstracted water quality with respect to Fe(II), Mn(II), and As. The injection of pre-treated drinking water caused Mn(II) exceedances that disappeared after a number of cycles, provided that the recovery would halt as soon as the Mn(II) exceedances would occur. The injection of desalinated water caused persisting Fe(II) exceedances, which substantially slowed the creation of an effective buffer zone; whereas, the injection of urban storm water caused similar issues with respect to arsenic. For both cases, it was shown that enriching the source water with O 2 and/or NaOH had major positive effects by accelerating the creation of an efficient buffer zone. Finally, we simulated a long-term operational rest of the ASR plant to evaluate water quality effects during potential migration of the stored water due to lateral groundwater flow, as dependent on source water composition and pretreatment method. Exceedances of drinking water guidelines occurred long before the arrival of the native water. Fe(II) and Mn(II) exceedances, after having used desalinated and drinking water, respectively, were observed after a bubble migration of 9 % and 40 %, respectively, and were associated with the slightly acidic pH conditions promoting the dissolution of Mn-carbonate and preventing an efficient sorptive removal. The arsenic exceedances, after using urban storm water, were associated with the arsenic wave deriving from the pyrite oxidation and reaching the ASR well after 34 % of bubble migration. Enrichment of the source water with O 2 and/or NaOH was also helpful in protecting the water quality around the ASR well for a longer time during a bubble migration scenario. The Fe(II) breakthrough occurred after 59 % of desalinated bubble migration (instead of 9 %) whereas As broke through after 70 % of urban storm bubble migration (instead of 34 %). This study illustrates that reactive transport modeling with a calibrated model is a useful tool to a-priori test the potential effectiveness of various operational options in ASR application on improving recovered water quality and the recovery efficiency...|$|E

40|$|This thesis forms part of {{a project}} with the {{objective}} of developing and implementing a novel, wood-based, process for the industrial production of cellulose textile fibres. This new process should not only be cost effective but also have far less environmental impact then current processes. Natural and man-made fibres are usually plagued with problems (e. g. economic and environmental) and are unsuitable in meeting growing demands. The focus of this thesis was therefore to investigate the dissolution of cellulose derived from various pulps in novel aqueous solvent systems.             It was shown that cellulose could be dissolved in a NaOH/H 2 O solvent at low temperatures (< 0 °C) and that such an alkaline solvent can be improved regarding the solubility, stability and rheological properties of the cellulose dopes formed if different additives (salts or amphiphilic molecules) are used. The effect <b>of</b> different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>pretreatment</b> (individually and combined) and the influence of pulp properties on cellulose accessibility and dissolution were also evaluated. These pretreatments affected, as expected, some characteristic properties of the pulps mainly by reducing the DP but also, for example, changing the composition of the carbohydrates. Not only did the pretreatment affect the solubility it also increased the stability of the cellulose dopes, resembling the effect of chemical additives to the NaOH system. According to multivariate data analysis it was established that, of the pulp properties analyzed, only the composition of carbohydrates and the DP had a significant influence on the solubility of the pulps used in this study. Finally, it was emphasized that the dissolution of cellulose pulps seemed to be controlled by a very complex interaction between both kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. CelluNov...|$|R

Candidates {{for the most}} successful materials fulfilling these requirements are newly developed laminates of biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films containing a thin inorganic barrier layer and possessing an oxygen permeability lower than 3 cm 3 /(m 2 /dbar) and a moisture permeability lower than 0. 05 g/m 2 day). The thin barrier layers are produced by vacuum web coating of BOPP films.

Here we present a pretreatment method based on traditional kraft pulping, which opens the wood structure, so that enzymes are able to attack the wood components. To study this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> chemical <b>pretreatment,</b> spruce wood samples were treated at similar conditions used in kraft cooking at varying intensities (H-factors). To verify if the structure was “opened” for enzymes, the pretreated wood samples were incubated with a cellulolytic culture filtrate, and the released reducing sugar concentration after the enzymatic hydrolysis was measured. The results indicated that un-pretreated wood fibers could not be attacked by the enzymes, but already relatively mild pretreatment was sufficient for letting the culture filtrate attack wood polysaccharides, and more intensive treatments opened the structure further. The mildest treatments did not cause any significant yield losses of lignin (Klason lignin). Some galactogluco-mannans were however lost during the pretreatments. The mechanisms behind the effect and the technical significance of the method are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Amorphous Molybdenum Sulfide (MoSx) {{has been}} {{identified}} as an excellent catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is still a challenge to prepare amorphous MoSx as a more active and stable catalyst for the HER Here the amorphous MoSx catalysts are prepared on carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrates at 200 degrees C by a simple hydrothermal method using molybdic acid and thioacetamide. Because the CFP is intrinsically hydrophobic due to its graphene-like carbon structure, two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> hydrophilic <b>pretreatment</b> methods, [plasma pretreatment (PP) and electrochemical pretreatment (EP) ] are investigated to convert the hydrophobic surface of the CFP to be hydrophilic prior to the hydrothermal growth of MoSx. In the HER catalysis, the MoSx, catalysts grown on the pretreated CFPs reach a cathodic current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a much lower overpotential of 231 mV on the MoSx/EP-CFP and 205 mV on the MoSx/PP-CFP, compared to a high overpotential of 290 mV on the MoSx of the nonpretreated CFP. Turnover frequency per site is also significantly improved when the MoSx are grown on the pretreated CFPs. However, the Tafel slopes of all amorphous MoSx catalysts are in the range of 46 - 50 mV/dec., suggesting the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism as a major pathway for the HER. In addition, regardless of the presence or absence <b>of</b> the <b>pretreatment,</b> the hydrothermally grown MoSx catalyst on CFP exhibits such excellent stability that the degradation of the cathodic current density is negligible after 1000 cycles in a stability test, possibly due to the relatively high growth temperatureclose...|$|R
40|$|Two-step steam <b>pretreatment</b> <b>of</b> {{softwood}} on {{laboratory scale}} {{has previously been}} shown to result in higher yields than one-step steam pretreatment. In this study, these results are verified on a larger scale. In an industrial process filtration and washing of the material between the two pretreatment steps are difficult without release of pressure. A worst case without filtration or washing was thus investigated to {{determine the influence of}} poor washing on the yield of sugars and the formation <b>of</b> byproducts. Steam <b>pretreatment</b> with SO 2 impregnation was investigated using three different procedures. One-step steam pretreatment was performed at 215 degreesC for 5 min. Two different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> two-step steam <b>pretreatment</b> were performed at 190 degreesC for 2 min in the first step and at 210 degreesC for 5 min in the second step. In one case the slurry obtained after the first pretreatment step was separated into a liquid and a solid phase, where the water-insoluble solid material was washed with water and then used for pretreatment in the second step. In the other case <b>of</b> two-step steam <b>pretreatment,</b> neither separation nor washing was performed. The pretreated material was evaluated using both enzymatic hydrolysis and fed-batch simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. Both two-step steam pretreatment process configurations investigated resulted in higher yields of ethanol (300 L/ton) than one-step steam pretreatment (227 L/ton). Separation and washing of the material between the pretreatment steps in the two-step steam pretreatment process did not improve the overall sugar yield, although the formation of sugar degradation products was reduced...|$|R

40|$|Lignocellulosic biomass is {{the most}} {{abundant}} renewable energy bioresources available today. Due to its recalcitrant structure, lignocellulosic feedstocks cannot be directly converted into fermentable sugars. Thus, an additional step known as the pretreatment is needed for efficient enzyme hydrolysis for the release <b>of</b> sugars. Various <b>pretreatment</b> technologies have been developed and examined for different biomass feedstocks. One of the major concerns <b>of</b> <b>pretreatments</b> is the degradation of sugars and formation <b>of</b> inhibitors during <b>pretreatment.</b> The inhibitor formation affects in the following steps after pretreatments such as enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation {{for the release of}} different bioenergy products. The sugar degradation and formation of inhibitors depend on the types and conditions <b>of</b> <b>pretreatment</b> and types <b>of</b> biomass.

The treated sample was extracted by acetone thrice in ultrasonic bath, then mixed the three extracted solutions. Anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 {{was used to}} remove water in extract solution and NZ was used to concentrate the solution. The concentrated solution was transferred to Florisil column and the mixture of acetic ester and alkyl (1 / 5, v/v) was used to elute it. At last, the treated samples were analyzed qualitatively by gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry (GC-EI/MS), and they were quantified by internal standard method. The conditions <b>of</b> <b>pretreatment</b> such as the selection of the extractant, the sorbent, the sorbent activation method and the eluent were optimized. The problem of controlling analysis blank was discussed. The linear correlation coefficient was higher than 0. 9999, the limit of detection was lower than 3. 7 g/L, the recovery values were in the range of 64. 1 % to 124 % and the relative standard deviation of the method was lower than 16. 4 %.
