The most important <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> contributing to the overall productivity of the Maltese fishing industry, both in terms of total biomass landed and total generated income, was comprised of vessels using hooks in 2009 - 2011. These vessels mainly used drifting surface longlines to target large pelagic species. In 2011, this <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> accounted for the largest number of full time employment positions, and was the most important <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> in terms of total investment.

However, limited information is available on stock status {{as well as on the}} potential impacts of climate change on several important target species such as sword sh, dolphin sh and blue n tuna. In order to ensure the continued competitiveness of the Maltese fishing fleet in light of this uncertain situation, it is suggested that an emphasis is placed on ensuring that the industry is flexible and able to eff ectively market and promote new products as and when they emerge.

40|$|Research PaperIn this paper, the {{estimate}} of the productive efficiency for some Italian <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> is proposed. The estimate {{is based on a}} Stochastic Frontier Production (SFP) function and a Data Envelopment Analysis frontier (DEA) using micro data of fishing vessels. The essential random nature of the fishing processes under consideration suggests that stochastic method might be preferable to non-parametric DEA method for efficiency estimation. In other words, the risk connected with DEA is that random noise, probably due to exogenous shocks or measurement error, may be considered as inefficient. On the other hand, DEA does not identify an explicit functional form for the production function combined with a distributional form for the inefficiency term. Therefore, DEA should be less prone to mis-specification than Stochastic Frontier Production. In fishery literature, several empirical comparisons between DEA and SFP have been conducted in order to assess the level of efficiency of fishing vessels and <b>fleet</b> <b>segments.</b> This paper attempts to apply both techniques, simultaneously, to the Mediterranean area which is characterized by multi-speciies and artisanal-type fishery...|$|R

The {{existence}} of excessive fishing capacity is globally recognized by resource managers {{as a major}} problem for fisheries, which is responsible for the degradation of fishery resources and for significant economic waste. Lately, the measurement of fishing capacity and capacity utilization has become more important due to the various national and international agreements and policies to reduce capacity in fisheries throughout the world. In this study, estimates of the fishing capacity and capacity utilization of the Eastern Mediterranean purse seiners were made using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Estimates were made for individual vessels based on the level of inputs used and outputs produced, relative to the other vessels operating under similar conditions. Analyses were made for the two fleet segments operating in Greece, 12 - 24 m and 24 - 40 m. From the DEA results of our study it was evidenced that both fleets were operating below their unbiased capacity output level.

Economic {{performance}} of different <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> varies considerably {{from year to}} year, with some segments experiencing increased profitability while others experience decreased profitability. This variation is {{generally considered to be}} a consequence of the stochasticity in the industry. However, there is growing evidence that fisheries may not be as stochastic as generally thought. In this paper, a spatial bioeconomic model is developed of a multi-species multi-gear fishery, which assumes individual profit maximising behaviour. It is shown that inter-annual variations in profits are a function of the spatial behaviour of the fishers, which tends to vary chaotically over time...|$|R

This investigation explored the predictive capability of linear and generalized additive models (GAMs) in providing daily fuel consumption estimates for fishing vessels given knowledge of their length, engine power, <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> (annual dominant gear type), and fuel prices. Models were fitted to half of the Irish fishing vessel economic data collected between 2003 and 2011. The predictive capabilities of the seven best models were validated against the remaining, previously un-modelled, data. The type of gear used by a <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> had an important influence on fuel consumption as did the price of fuel. The passive pot gear and Scottish seine gear segments indicated consistently lower consumptions, whereas dredge and pelagic gears showed consistently higher fuel consumptions. Furthermore, increasing fuel price negatively affected fuel consumption, especially for more powerful, larger vessels. Of the formulated models, the best fit to training data were a GAM with a gear main effect and two smooth functions; standardized vessel length and engine power interacting with fuel price. For prediction, overall, this model showed the closest predictions with the least bias, followed by three linear models. However, all seven models compared for predictive capability performed well for the most sampled segments (demersal and pelagic trawlers). This is an author produced pre-print pdf.

A model system is presented that combines stochastic age-structured population dynamics with complex fisheries economics. Explicitly, the economic response of <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> to changes in stock development is analysed by applying observed values and stochastic recruitment. The optimization of net profits determines the fishing effort and the investment and disinvestment behaviour of <b>fleet</b> <b>segments,</b> which, in turn, affect the level of catch rates and discards. This tool was applied to the North Sea saithe fishery, where ICES re-evaluated the existing EU–Norway management plan, focusing on biological reference points only. Two scenarios were tested with alternative harvest control rules and then contrasted with one unregulated scenario with no quotas and driven by optimizing the net profit of the whole fleet. The model showed the success of both harvest control rules in rebuilding the stock and the associated costs to the fleets in terms of maximal 21 % reduction in net profits, 21 % reduction in crew wages and 11 % reduction in fleet size in the midterm (2007 – 2015). In the long term (2022), successful stock recovery coincided with net profits almost equalling that of the unrestricted fishery.

However, concerning the Baltic herring, its populations developed well. Nevertheless, the German quota has been used only by 13 % because of marketing problems.

Landings per Unit of Effort (kilograms per boat per day) for each trawling <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> have been analysed, by comparing on a monthly basis the before (2007 - 2009) and after ban (2011 - 2013) period. The comparison was carried out considering total landings and the six main species targeted inside the three miles area (sand smelt, cuttlefish, red mullet, sole, turbot, and mantis shrimp). Within a general reduction of total landings, a differential effect based on the analysed metiers was detected, with small trawlers being more negatively affected than the large and rapido ones, which showed, for some species, positive impacts. From an ecological point of view, though, no positive overall effects were detected, probably {{due to the fact that}} the adopted measure is not sufficient to reduce the overexploitation.

40|$|The Peruvian {{anchoveta}} {{fishery is}} currently targeted {{by a large}} fleet featuring {{a wide range of}} vessel sizes (segments), with highly variable capacities. In addition, the landings of the industrial fleet are used exclusively by the reduction industry, while those performed by small- and medium-scale vessels are destined mainly for direct human consumption. Despite these differences, the entire fleet is made up of purse seiners that perform similar operations when at sea. Therefore, the main aim {{of this study is to}} identify the differences in eco-efficiency between the different <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> in order to delve into the potential environmental improvements that could be attained through operational benchmarking. To this end, the combined use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was applied to the Peruvian anchoveta fleet.

The large marine fauna studied were not target species of the commercial <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> interviewed (trawl fishery). The fishers were asked to rank the perceived abundance in each period into qualitative ordinal classes based on two indicators: frequency of sightings and frequency of catches (incidental or intentional) of each taxonomic group. The statistical analysis of the survey results showed that both incidental catches and the sighting frequency of dolphins have decreased significantly over the 60 + years of the study period (except for in Greece due to the recent population increase). This shows that fishers' perceptions are in agreement with the declining population trends detected by scientists. Shark catches were also perceived to have diminished since the early 1940 s for all species.

40|$|Research PaperA key {{conclusion}} of 'Net Benefits' - the landmark 2004 strategic {{review of the}} UK fishing industry - was that a sustainable UK fleet must make long-run profits adequate to invest in new boats, improve safety levels, pay good wages for skilled staff {{and be able to}} survive in years when stocks are poor (p. 47, Cabinet Office (2004)). This paper presents a description of the method used to estimate the possible size of sustainable and profitable Northern Irish whitefish and nephrops fleet segments in 2013. An optimisation model was constructed to determine the maximum number of fishing vessels in a <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> that could generate the minimum acceptable level of profit under a range of possible assumptions. The optimisation model allowed average vessel catch rates, fishing effort, skipper/crew wages and fleet size to adjust within practical bounds. The optimisation model was combined with a 'futures analysis' which developed three sets of possible scenarios (Pessimistic, Best Guess and Optimistic) for the NI fishing sector in 2013 through a combination of data/trend analysis, consultation and round-table consensus-seeking discussion with experts and stakeholders. Each future scenario was developed using mutually consistent assumptions about : (1) expected outcome of TAC negotiations, (2) compliance levels, (3) continuance of recent diversification trends, (4) impact of Irish Sea warming, (5) fish and fuel price trends and (6) Nephrops marketing practices. The analysis does not provide a blueprint for future development of the NI fishing fleet. Rather it provides an aid with which policy makers and industry can objectively and systematically evaluate possible future development pathways and identify key drivers which will have most effect on the fleet's capacity, profitability, legality and sustainability in the future.

40|$|Research PaperThis work {{analyses}} empirically {{the exploitation}} dynamics from 1997 to 2003, {{of the most}} important segment of the Spanish fishing fleet operating in the EU waters, also known as “ 300 fleet”. The aim of the analysis is exploring the economic consequences of the coming into force of the new approaches in the EU fisheries management system in the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy Reform, particularly from an institutional point of view. Such analysis is based on the use of suitable index analysis for quantifying the contribution caused by the variation in prices, catches, and capital productivity into the changes in production of this <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> during this period. For this case analysis, It is suggested that the current EU fishing resources management system distorts the biological perception of scarceness or abundance of resources through the institutional framework of quota allocation. Quota allocation is becoming the factor that contributes most to explain the variations in fleet income, as against capital productivity that plays a secondary role. However capital productivity would explain the higher contribution to income generation provided that the biological perception of scarceness was internalised faithfully in the institutional framework for EU fishing quota setting and allocation. Restrictions on fishing activities, based on quotas and licences limit the range of strategies that the Spanish fleet operating in EU waters can deploy in order to face biological variability, improvement of technology and changes in fish market prices. These observations lead {{to the conclusion that the}} current fishing resources management system during the Common Fisheries Policy Reform, could have been distorting the biological perception of scarceness or abundance of natural resources and reduce the capital productivity contribution in the income creation, by making the fishing capital less malleable, and by generating less economic efficiency in the Spanish fleet under TAC regulation...|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} within {{the scientific community}} that a single species approach to European mixed fisheries can result in species-specific advice inconsistent with multi-species management objectives. Within the reformed Common Fisheries Policy a move toward mixed fisheries and ecosystem based management is encouraged. The overall objective {{of this research was}} to improve understanding of the complex targeting behaviour undertaken by commercial fishers. Whereby, improved understanding will enhance the ability to predict the responses to future mixed fisheries management measures and changing economic conditions within the Irish fishing industry. Irish métiers (groups of homogeneous fishing trips) highlight the complexity of fishing activities within the Irish fleet, having identified 33 otter trawl métiers and 19 in the remainder of the fleet. Métier dynamics identified over compensation to introduced management, resulting in effort displacement and increased temporal specific fishing pressure. Therefore were deemed as appropriate base units for all subsequent analyses. Two economic variables, operational fishing cost and trip landings value, considered to represent important drivers were developed. This lead to application of a general additive model to estimate and predict fuel consumption estimates according to <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> definitions. A linear mixed effects model with random vessel effect was developed as a method of standardising value generating an index of value per unit effort. This identified kilowatt fishing days as the most appropriate effort measure. The final investigation stage successfully amalgamated the knowledge gained into the formulation of novel Markov transition probability for a multinomial model to predict fisher métier strategy choice. This is to be incorporated into management strategy evaluation, aiding the assessment and possible impacts of future management proposals on the Irish fleet and commercial stocks around Ireland. Developments presented will benefit the progression toward optimising sustainability within a mixed fisheries approach to management through incorporation of economic considerations.

The purpose of the EIA is to provide information that supports decision-making and understanding at a <b>fleet</b> <b>segment,</b> home nation and national level. The EIA has been undertaken in two phases: choke analysis and bioeconomic scenario analysis. The choke analysis provides a view of what the activity of six UK fleet segments {{would have been in}} 2013 had the proposed rules for the landing obligation in 2016 and 2019 been in place. This provides a high level, worst case snapshot of choke stocks by fleet indicating how many days fishing could have been achieved in 2013 before the primary choke stock quota was exhausted. The analysis is performed for each major sea area surrounding the UK. Following on from the choke analysis, the scenario analysis answers the question, what are the potential outcomes for the fleet from the introduction of various landing obligation policy levers? The model includes policy levers such as exemptions (de minimis and surviviability), derogations (inter-species flexibility) and quota uplift (top-up) and considers two views of quota held by fleet: initial quota allocation and end of year quota held (approximated by landings). The scenarios simulate the possible outcomes over the coming years and identify issues of resilience, viability and vulnerability in key segments of the UK fleet. This paper presents the model and reviews the methodology used in the two phases of the Seafish UK landing obligation EIA...|$|E
40|$|The new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is {{designed}} to represent an appropriate response to the uncertainties and challenges facing the fisheries sector. It also adopts a holistic approach to fisheries management, considering all factors driving fishers' behavior, and ultimately, the long-term maintenance of living resources. The most reliable way to pursue these aims could be represented by {{a change in the}} exploitation pattern, in order to guarantee the sustainability of fisheries without compromising their socioeconomic viability. In this paper, the demersal fisheries of the Ionian Sea [Geographic Sub-area (GSA) 19] were analyzed with respect to their spatial, temporal, economic, and biological characteristics in terms of four key species for fisheries, namely European hake, red mullet, giant red shrimp, and deep-water rose shrimp. Specifically, (1) a quantitative procedure was applied to break down the whole system (including small-scale fleet components) into a series of fishing grounds using input data about fishing efforts; (2) the different fleet segments were defined as a combination of main gear and fishing grounds; (3) the effort and production by <b>fleet</b> <b>segment</b> were derived according to biological samplings of commercial data (Data Collection Framework for the collection and management of fisheries data, DCF), information on localization of nursery and spawning grounds, and expert knowledge; and (4) all this information was used to feed a bioeconomic modeling tool (BEMTOOL), and to explore alternative exploitation patterns. A series of scenarios including the status quo were defined, starting from the actual management approach based on temporal fishing closure. The results showed that significant improvements in the exploitation pattern could be achieved by setting up spatial and/or temporal gear-specific bans of the fishing activity. More specifically, scenarios based on a 3 -month fishing ban for trawlers are expected to provide high rebuilding of the spawning stock biomass (SSB) for all target stocks, and at the same time, result in a remarkable reduction of discards. When combined with a seasonal fishing ban for small-scale fleets equipped with nets and longlines, this approach could lead to a significant improvement in all indicators, but especially the SSB of the exploited species...|$|E
40|$|This report {{assesses the}} {{environmental}} and social impacts of the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), running from 2000 to 2006, using a range of quantitative and qualitative information. EU allocations for FIFG totalled  3. 2 billion, of which Spain received nearly half. Member State contributions brought the total allocation of FIFG funding to  4. 9 billion. A key objective of structural policy in the fisheries sector was to bring the fishing capacity of the European fleet into line with available biological resources. We identify that FIFG funding has not achieved the intended net fishing capacity reduction and, in some <b>fleet</b> <b>segments,</b> has led to fleet capacity increases. This {{has contributed to the}} worsening status of some stocks and has hindered the recovery of other stocks, as well as having had associated negative impacts on marine environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of the EU long-term management plan for cod stocks, in force since 2009, is analysed focusing on the human and institutional factors. The plan operates through landings quotas (TACs) and effort restrictions following a Harvest Control Rule, and deploys a novel instrument allowing Member States to ‘buy back’ or increase fishing effort for <b>fleet</b> <b>segments</b> engaged in cod-avoidance measures. The stipulated fishing mortality reductions have not been achieved. On the positive side, the ‘buy-back’ instrument has led to increased uptake of selective gear and implementation of permanent and real- time temporary closures. On the negative side, ignoring the dimension of fishers as reactive agents in the design, the impact assessment, and the annual implementation of the measures {{has contributed to the}} failure to adequately implement the plan and achieve its objectives.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding the spatiotemporal {{behavior}} of fishermen at the fleet scale is key for defining effective strategies for fisheries management. Here we classify the spatial patterns exhibited by fishing trip trajectories in the world's largest monospecific fishery, the Peruvian anchovy fishery. Our {{goal is to}} identify spatial strategies and their possible changes over 2000 - 2009. The data comprise more than 350, 000 fishing trips, recorded using a vessel monitoring system. On-board observers monitored {{a small fraction of}} those trips (> 2000), providing data for inferring the type of activity (fishing, searching, and cruising) from the position records, for use in a state-space model. Each fishing trip was characterized by its duration, maximum distance to the coast, geographical extension, and time spent fishing, searching and cruising. Using clustering techniques, we identified four types of fishing trips, associated with differences in management among regions, <b>fleet</b> <b>segments,</b> and skippers' behavior. The methodology could be used to investigate fishing spatial strategies using VMS trajectories in other fisheries...|$|R
