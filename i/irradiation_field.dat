[...] However, the <b>irradiation</b> <b>field</b> is potentially large as it must include the whole stomach, which can vary greatly in size and shape.

Hence, radiotherapy is the preferred approach for local disease where antibiotic therapy has failed, or is not indicated. Evidence also suggests that radiotherapy can be utilized to control localized relapses outside the original radiation field.|$|E

The probabilistic nature of the model captures prediction uncertainties and can therefore be used by solar energy producers to quantify the operation risks. The model is simple to implement and can make predictions in realtime with minimal computational resources. To deal with the high-dimensionality of the satellite data, we {{construct a}} reduced representation using factor anal-ysis. Then, we model {{the dynamics of the}} reduced representation as a discrete (30 -minute interval) dynamical system. In order to convey information about the movement of the <b>irradiation</b> <b>field,</b> the dynamical system has a two-step delay.

40|$|Isomeric {{activities}} were induced in indium by gamma irradiation {{in three different}} gamma fields, through the reactions 115 In([gamma], [gamma]') 115 mIn and 113 In([gamma], [gamma]') 113 mIn. The <b>irradiation</b> <b>fields</b> were (i) the 15 kCi 60 Co source available in the University, (ii) the spent fuel gamma irradiator in the pool of the University's Ford Nuclear Reactor (FNR) and (iii) south face of {{the core of the}} FNR during routine shut downs. Isomeric activation ratios can serve to characterize gamma fields, provided the response functions of the two ([gamma], [gamma]') reactions sample different energy regimes of the gamma spectrum present in the <b>irradiation</b> <b>fields.</b> The response of an isomeric activation detector, in turn, depends on the number of activation energy levels of the nuclide and the probabilities with which the activation levels de-populate to the isomeric level. The reaction rate ratio RIn 115 m/RIn 113 m was measured in the three gamma fields. The measured ratios were (i) 1. 210 +/- 0. 011 in the 60 Co source, (ii) 1. 314 +/- 0. 060 in the spent fuel gamma irradiator and (iii) 1. 298 +/- 0. 039 in a location alongside the FNR core during routine shut downs. The measured reaction rate ratios are not only close to each other, but close to unity as well. This indicates that the excitation functions for the reactions 115 In([gamma], [gamma]') 115 mIn and 113 In([gamma], [gamma]') 113 mIn have similar shapes and that for the nuclides 115 In and 113 In, the number of activation energy levels and the probabilities with which they populate the isomeric levels are very similar to each other. Thus, the ratio RIn 115 m/RIn 113 m will not yield any information regarding the shape of gamma spectrum in the field of measurement. However by choosing ([gamma], [gamma]') reactions with different shapes for the excitation functions one can measure a set of isomeric activation ratios that characterize a given gamma field...|$|R

40|$|Teleradiotherapy imposes the {{requirement}} of high accuracy in reference to its medical as well as technical aspects. Close adherence to the geometrical parameters set up in therapy planning is vital. The current location of the <b>irradiation</b> <b>field</b> and anatomical structures can be recorded in the portal image acquired during the therapy course. Assessment of the treatment accuracy consists in registration (overlaying) of the reference and the portal image to compare the layout of anatomical structures and the <b>irradiation</b> <b>field.</b> Edges of the compared features are difficult {{to find in the}} portal image, which is inherently of low contrast. Hence, not all the edges present in the reference image {{can be found in the}} portal one, and the comparison of geometries in these images is difficult and time-consuming. There exists a need for a tool that could support and objectify this process. At present the accuracy assessment is done manually by an experienced observer. As a rule, this tedious procedure is not performed routinely. The wide literature on image registration refers to portal images made with beams generated in accelerators rather than with the cobalt apparata. In Poland more than a half of patients are treated with cobalt. There are numerous references to image registration methods tailored for finding the fitting and non-fitting fragments of the compared edges. The majority of these methods lack generality. The methodology to be presented is general and requires little user intervention. •Features to be matched: edges of selected anatomical structures, <b>irradiation</b> <b>field</b> and shields, as seen in scanned images. •Edge detector: zero-second-derivative with scale fitted to noise and scale of edges, separately in portal and reference images. •Geometrical transformation: affine (2 translations, rotation, 2 scalings – along two coordinate axes). •Measure of fitting accuracy: modified Hausdorff distance measure – robust method based on voting. Parts of the contours that do not fit the general tendency are rejected. This is vital if portal images made with cobalt apparata are analysed. •Optimisation method for finding the best transformation: maximum gradient (chamfer matching). •Final fit can be calculated with le least squares method for only those pixels which were classified as fitting. •Speed-ups: hierarchical method (pyramid of resolutions); in some cases: pre-calculated virtual transformations. •Automatic classification of edges as belonging to anatomic structures, <b>irradiation</b> <b>field</b> or shields is possible. •Experiments with enhancing the contrast of portal images using the optical system transfer function concept. The software tool will be presented which makes it possible to correct the therapeutic system geometry or the location of the patient.
