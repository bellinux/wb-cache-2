[...] Paul Kolderie, who had worked at Fort Apache Studios with Smith, recommended the Boston recording studio Q Division to Albini. This created tension between Smith and Kolderie, and Kolderie later remarked that [...] "Gary almost killed me for the suggestion, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> scheming to get the project." ...|$|E
500|$|Vernon Gholston did {{not play}} {{football}} at Cass until his sophomore year and {{did not play}} on defense (at linebacker) until his senior year. Gholston did not even see himself as a football player {{when he was in}} high school, yet he has gone on to become an Ohio State Buckeyes football defensive end, the 2007 Big Ten Conference Defensive lineman of the year and the sixth overall selection in the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] According to Gholston, [...] "It was between periods and I was going to my next class. ...<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> actually somebody’s father walking down the hall. He asked me whom was I looking for. I was like, 'Nobody. I go here.' He really couldn't believe it. He kind of grabbed me at that point and put me on the team." ...|$|E
500|$|The direct {{impetus for}} the lyrics was an {{encounter}} with IRA supporters in New York City. As a promotional gimmick, U2 manager Paul McGuinness had made arrangements for the band {{to appear in the}} 1982 St. Patrick's Day parade. However, he later found that there was a possibility that Bobby Sands, an IRA hunger striker who had starved to death the previous year, would be the parade's honorary marshal. As they felt that the IRA's tactics were prolonging the fighting in Northern Ireland, McGuinness and the band members mutually decided they should withdraw from the parade. McGuinness met with one of the parade's organizers in a New York bar to arrange the cancellation, and ended up in a heated debate about the IRA. McGuinness recalled, [...] "He kept telling me to keep my voice down. The place was full of New York policemen - Irish cops - and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to get us killed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prescott {{has been}} {{involved}} in a number of controversies and incidents that have caused public concern and widespread media interest. During the 2001 election campaign, Prescott was campaigning in Rhyl, Denbighshire when farmer Craig Evans threw an egg at him, which struck him in the neck. Prescott, a former amateur boxer, responded immediately with a straight left to the jaw. The incident, overshadowing the launch of the Labour Party manifesto on that day, was captured by numerous television crews. Tony Blair responded succinctly, stating, [...] "John is John". A National Opinion Polls (NOP) survey found that the incident appeared to do no public harm to Prescott, and may even have benefited his standing amongst male voters. The incident {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "Rumble in Rhyl". Speaking on Top Gear, Prescott noted that [...] "I was against fox-hunting, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> one of the guys he hated because I wanted to keep fox-hunting". He elaborated ...|$|E
2500|$|Selfish Whining Monkeys: How we Ended Up Greedy, Narcissistic and Unhappy, {{appeared}} in 2014. Admitting to having {{paid little attention}} to Liddle's journalism, Will Self, in his review for The Guardian wrote: [...] "it's so much more authoritative to hear a man condemned out of his own mouth over 200-plus pages than it is to assay him on the basis of newspaper columns, which, by and large, favour polarised views tendentiously expressed." [...] Despite his serious reservations about Liddle's writing, Self concludes: [...] "The peculiar thing is that I can't find it in my heart of hearts to dislike the man, I think there's good in him and that he can change his bilious complexion." [...] Liddle responded to Self's review in an interview with Archie Bland of The Independent a few weeks later: [...] "He reviewed what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> not what the book was about. Bizarre. I think it's slightly deranged." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} years of their marriage, as {{described}} by Loretta Lynn in her autobiography Still Woman Enough:I married Doo when I wasn't but a child, and he was my life from that day on. But as important as my youth and upbringing was, there's something else that made me stick to Doo. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> something special, more special {{than anyone else in the}} world, and never let me forget it. That belief would be hard to shove out the door. Doo was my security, my safety net. And just remember, I'm explainin', not excusin'. (Still Woman Enough xvii) ... Doo was a good man and a hard worker. But he was an alcoholic, and it affected our marriage all the way through. He was also a womanizer. Cheating husbands have been all over the news talk shows for a few years now. Lots of women say they don't understand why women stay with them dogs. My story is about one who did—me.(Still Woman Enough, p. xiii).|$|E

5000|$|Dantes {{portrayal}} of della Vigna emphasises his skill as a rhetorician. His syntax {{is complex and}} tangled, like the thornbushes. At one point, Dante echoes it: [...] "I think <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking", according to John Ciardis translation. In placing him among the suicides rather than the traitors, Dante is affirming that della Vigna was falsely or wrongly accused.|$|R
