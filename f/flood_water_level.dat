40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the sensitivities of flood wave propagation to variations in certain control variables and boundary conditions by means of the adjoint method. This uses a variational technique to find the relationships between changes in predicted <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> and changes in control variables such as the inflow hydrograph, bed roughness, and bed elevation. The sensitivities can be used for optimal control of hydraulic structures, for data assimilation, for decision makers' procedures, for the analysis of the effects of uncertainties in control variables on the predictions of <b>floods</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels,</b> and for investigating both the sensitivities of model flood forecasts to model parameters, boundary and initial conditions. Example of the last application of the sensitivity analysis is presented and discussed These methods are developed and implemented through a numerical hydraulic model of channel flow based on the Shallow Water Equations (SWEs) and the corresponding adjoint model. The equations are integrated using finite difference methods and a new modified method of characteristics is used to define the open boundaries. Results of validation tests on both the forward hydraulic model and on the adjoint model are presented...|$|R
50|$|The river floods {{during the}} snow melting {{season in the}} spring. The spring flood usually peaks {{in the second half}} of May, when the river becomes 8-10 times wider than during the late-summer low water season. The city is {{protected}} from flooding by a dike which can withstand floods up to 8 m high. The highest ever <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in Tyumen was 9.15 m, recorded in 1979.

5000|$|A one-hundred-year flood is a {{flood event}} {{that has a}} 1% {{probability}} of occurring in any given year. The 100-year flood is {{also referred to as}} the 1% flood, since its annual exceedance probability is 1%. [...] For river systems, the 100-year flood is generally expressed as a flowrate. Based on the expected 100-year flood flow rate, the <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> can be mapped as an area of inundation. The resulting floodplain map {{is referred to as the}} 100-year floodplain. Estimates of the 100-year flood flowrate and other streamflow statistics for any stream in the United States are available. In the UK The Environment Agency publishes a comprehensive map of all areas at risk of a 1 in 100 year flood (Flood zone 3) Areas near the coast of an ocean or large lake also can be flooded by combinations of tide, storm surge, and waves. Maps of the riverine or coastal 100-year floodplain may figure importantly in building permits, environmental regulations, and flood insurance.|$|E

Predicting flood helps us to take necessary precautions and save human lives. Several types of data (meteorological condition, topography, river characteristics, and human activities) are used to predict <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in an area. In our previous works, we proposed a belief rule based flood prediction system in a desktop environment. In this paper, we propose a web-service based flood prediction expert system by incorporating belief rule base with the capability of reading sensor data such as rainfall, river flow on real time basis. This will facilitate the monitoring of the various flood-intensifying factors, contributing in increasing the <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in an area. Eventually, the decision makers would able to take measures to control those factors and to reduce the intensity of flooding in an area.

40|$|The Mekong Delta {{is located}} in the South of Vietnam, where the Mekong River flows into the East Sea. The Mekong Delta is {{responsible}} for producing half of the national food volume for Vietnam. Socio-economic and agricultural development in particular, have encountered several restrictive factors though: decreasing amount of agricultural land, flooding of the Mekong River, acid sulphate soils and acid water movement, shortage of fresh-water and salt-water intrusion from the East Sea during low-flow discharges. The Dutch Delta Commission has been asked for advise, and the Commission recommended closure of the Cung Hau, Co Chien and Ham Luong branches of the Mekong River, all present in the Tien River estuary. The recommendation of the Commission has not been substantiated yet. It is expected that closure will have a positive influence on the salt-water intrusion and fresh-water availability, but also severe erosion in connecting channels and increasing <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> upstream might be occurring. In this report, the project goal is therefore determined as: “To determine and design the preferred type of closure of the Cung Hau, Co Chien and Ham Luong branches, that reduces salt-water intrusion in the Tien River estuary, minimalizes erosion of the connecting channels and prevents unacceptable increases of <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> levels”. The preferred type of closure is determined by means of the effects on salt-water intrusion, morphological changes and <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> These effects have been determined by means of Delft 3 D.

40|$|East Flood Way {{is one of}} {{the rivers}} in Semarang City that often cause flooding. <b>Flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in the East Flood Way is {{affected}} by the discharge of storm water runoff and tide (rob). Facts on the ground indicate that the <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in the canal tends to increase from year to year. One possible reason is the increased flood discharge associated with climate change, besides the impacts of land use changes. This study aims to analyze the impacts of climate change on rainfall characteristics and their effects on flood hydrograph in the East Flood Way. The study begins with the collection and analysis of historical rainfall data to get a change of rainfall characteristics over time. The flood hydrograph was then analysed by HEC HMS. The results showed that in the period of last 30 years annual rainfall and maximum daily rainfall tended to increase of 22. 64 mm / year and 2. 56 mm / year consecutively, while the number of rainy days tend to decrease of 4 days / year. As a result of changes in the characteristics of the rainfall, the flood discharge of East Flood Way is expected to increase in the range between the 15. 10 m 3 /s (31. 5 %) for 2 -year return period up to 32. 28 m 3 /s (25. 5 %) for 200 -year return period...|$|E

40|$|One {{dimensional}} flow {{is often}} used as a flood simulation for the planning capacity of the river. Flood {{is a type of}} unsteady non-uniform flow, that can be simulated using HEC-RAS. HEC-RAS software {{is often used}} for flood modeling with a one-dimensional flow method. Unsteady flow modeling results in HEC-RAS sometimes refer to error and warning due to unstable analysis program. The stability program among others influenced bend in the river flow, the steep slope of the river bottom, and changes in cross-section shape. Because the flood handling required maximum discharge and maximum <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>level,</b> then a steady flow is often used as an alternative to simulate the flood flow. This study aimed to determine {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} modeling unsteady non-uniform and steady non-uniform flow. The research location in the Kanal Banjir Barat, in the Semarang City.
