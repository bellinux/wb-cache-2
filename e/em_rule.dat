The first method consists of defining a Bayesian prior distribution on the parameter space. We derive EM (Expectation Maximization) update rules which maximize the a posterior parameter probability in contrast to the usual <b>EM</b> <b>rules</b> for Gaussian mixtures which maximize the likelihood function. In the second approach we apply ensemble averaging to density estimation. This includes Breiman's "bagging", which has recently been found to produce impressive results for classification networks. To our knowledge {{this is the first time}} that ensemble averaging is applied to improve density estimation. 1 Introduction Gaussian mixture models have recently attracted major attention in the neural network community.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a textile patch antenna designed for WBAN applications at 2. 45 GHz ISM band. The antenna uses denim as substrate and conductive fabric for the ground plane and radiator layers. The {{main purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the influence of typical deviation of denim properties and patch radiator dimensions on the performance of the antenna. The parameters considered in the analysis are the relative permittivity and thickness of denim and the width and length of the rectangular patch radiator. The dependence of the central operation frequency of the antenna on those parameters was studied using the antenna reflection coefficient obtained from <b>EM</b> simulations. <b>Rules</b> of thumb for one-shot design were derived and applied to design a rectangular patch antenna.

40|$|On August 17, 2017 the LIGO interferometers {{detected}} the gravitational wave (GW) signal (GW 170817) from the coalescence of binary neutron stars. This signal was also simultaneously seen throughout the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum from radio waves to gamma-rays. We {{point out that}} this simultaneous detection of GW and <b>EM</b> signals <b>rules</b> out a class of modified gravity theories, which dispense with the need for dark matter. This simultaneous observation also provides the first ever test of Einstein's Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) between gravitons and photons. We calculate the Shapiro time delay due to the gravitational potential of the total dark matter distribution along the line of sight (complementary to the calculation in arXiv: 1710. 05834) to be about 1000 days. Using this estimate for the Shapiro delay and from the time difference of 1. 7 seconds between the GW signal and gamma-rays, we can constrain violations of WEP using the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) parameter γ, and is given by |γ_GW-γ_EM|< 3. 9 × 10 ^- 8.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{neural network}} models for stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems where {{measurements of the}} variable of interest are only available at irregular intervals i. e. most realizations are missing. Difculties arise since the solutions for prediction and maximum likelihood learning with missing data lead to complex integrals, which even for simple cases cannot be solved analytically. In this {{paper we propose a}} speci c combination of a nonlinear recurrent neural predictive model and a linear error model which leads to tractable prediction and maximum likelihood adaptation rules. In particular, the recurrent neural network can be trained using the real-time recurrent learning rule and the linear error model can be trained by an <b>EM</b> adaptation <b>rule,</b> implemented using forward-backward Kalman lter equations. The model is applied to predict the glucose/insulin metabolism of a diabetic patient where blood glucose measurements are only available a few times a day at irregular intervals.

It is also available at: [URL] electromigration EM lifetime in short copper interconnects is modeled using a previously developed means of generating realistic interconnect microstructures combined with the one-dimensional stress evolution equation of Korhonen et al. J. Appl. Phys. 73, 3790 1993. This initial analysis describes the void nucleation and subsequent growth in lines blocked at one end and terminated with a pad at the other. For short copper interconnects, the failure time is largely spent on void growth, and, for sufficiently short lines (≤ 50 mm), the growth is largely steady state. This allows {{for the development of a}} simple expression for the variation of the failure time with microstructure. Assuming that the diffusion activation energies are normally distributed, the permanence property of summed lognormals leads to a roughly lognormal distribution for EM failure times. Importantly for <b>EM</b> design <b>rules,</b> linear extrapolation on lognormal plot is found to slightly underestimate interconnect reliability...|$|R

Little is known about the time spent in sedentary behaviour (SB) among children within the family context. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore how the family home environment may influence children 2 ̆ 7 s electronic-based SB. Focus groups and family interviews were conducted with 11 - to 12 -year old children (n = 54) and their parents (n = 38) using a semi-structured discussion guide. Transcripts were analysed using a thematic content approach. A brief self-completed questionnaire was also used to measure leisure behaviour and electronic devices at home. Children incorporated both sedentary and physical activities into their weekly routine. Factors influencing children 2 ̆ 7 s EM use included parent and sibling modelling and reinforcement, personal cognitions, the physical home environment and household <b>EM</b> use <b>rules</b> and restrictions. Participants were not concerned about the excessive time children spent with EM. This under-recognition emerged as a personal influencing factor and was viewed as a major barrier to modifying children 2 ̆ 7 s electronic-based SB. Efforts to reduce SB in children should focus on the influencing factors that reciprocally interact within the family home. An emphasis on increasing awareness about the risks associated with spending excessive time in screen-based activities should be a priority when developing intervention strategies aimed at modifying the time children spend in SB. <br /...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand by using smart and miniaturized microsensors and microtransducers {{in the areas of}} automobile, environment Science and analytical chemistry. Thin film microresonators (TFRs), meriting from their small size, higher sensitivity and compatibility with VLSI process, have being investigated as microsensors. Gas or vapor absorbed species, or contacted liquids may perturb resonator mechanical, electrical and piezoelectric properties. In this dissertation, a coupled wave theory is presented and applied to analyze acoustic wave propagation phenomena both in TFR-solid and TFR-liquid phases. A two-dimensional analysis is implemented to compare with a one-dimensional model and experimental results. The analysis and characterization of polymer-coated TFR sensors are investigated, along with sensitivity and detection limit analysis. The experimental characterization of liquid-coated TFR sensors are also then investigated and discussed. In order to minimize temperature-induced drift and other possible geometrical and material mismatch, the design and implementation of a TFR microsensor array in which a differential approach was proposed have been demonstrated. The major challenge in the array design is to evaluate the wave crosstalks between individual TFRs and to investigate film mechanical strength in order to host multi-TFRs on a single substrate dice. General analytic <b>EM</b> design <b>rules</b> and numerical methods are used to model lateral wave coupling and assist the design of process masks.

To deal with this probl <b>em,</b> we introduce <b>rules</b> based text tagging method, which allows filtering web service description to keep only significant information. A new representation based on such filtered data is then introduced. Many web services have empty descriptions.

The impact of the use of these representations on web service discovery and recommendation is studied and discussed in the experimentation using real world web services...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an `execution monitor' (EM); {{it is the}} key component of a motion control architecture for a vehicle moving in a dynamic and partially known environment. EM endows the vehicle with the reactive capabilities required in an uncertain environment. Its purpose is to generate the commands for the servo-systems of the vehicle so as to follow a given nominal trajectory while reacting in real-time to unexpected events. EM is designed as a fuzzy controller, i. e.  a control system based upon fuzzy logic, thus permitting approximate reasoning and a human-like description of the vehicle's reactive behaviour. The main components of EM are an inference engine {{and a set of}} `linguistic rules'. The global behaviour of the vehicle results from the combination of several basic behaviours (trajectory following, obstacle avoidance, etc.), each of which is encoded by a specific set of <b>rules.</b> <b>EM</b> differs from classical fuzzy controllers in two novel ways: first, it introduces a new defuzzification technique, the Barycentre of the Centres Of Area, that permits to better take into account the influence of each and every rule. Second, weighing coefficients are attached to the rules thus permitting a fine tuning of the influence of each basic behaviour. Furthermore it is shown how supervised learning, i. e.  learning through samples, can be used to automate the determination of these weights thus suppressing the ever delicate problem of finding such coefficients (the identification problem). EM has been implemented and tested on an electric car-like vehicle prototype. Promising results of preliminary experiments featuring trajectory following and unexpected obstacle avoidance are presented...|$|R
