But the therocephalians ("beast heads"), which appear to have arisen {{at about the same}} time as the gorgonopsians, had additional mammal-like features, e.g. their finger and toe bones had the same number of phalanges (segments) as in early mammals (and the same number that primates have, including humans).|$|E
25|$|Changes in DNA {{caused by}} {{mutation}} can cause errors in protein sequence, creating partially or completely non-functional proteins. Each cell, {{in order to}} function correctly, depends on thousands of proteins to function <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>places</b> at the right times. When a mutation alters a protein that plays {{a critical role in}} the body, a medical condition can result. Some mutations alter a gene's DNA base sequence but do not change the function of the protein made by the gene. One study on the comparison of genes between different species of Drosophila suggests that if a mutation does change a protein, this will probably be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial. Studies have shown that only 7% of point mutations in noncoding DNA of yeast are deleterious and 12% in coding DNA are deleterious. The rest of the mutations are either neutral or slightly beneficial.|$|E

[...] Linda Amiel Burns, however, wrote of the piano-only accompaniment that additional instrumentation [...] "would have made the arrangements more interesting and exciting". She praised Evancho's voice but thought that some of the song choices were odd, and that sometimes [...] "it was difficult to understand the lyrics." [...] She felt that Evancho sounded more comfortable in her classical selections, but that pop songs require [...] "a different vocal technique with more emphasis on the lyrics ... she has to watch her phrasing ... breathe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>places,</b> and find the deeper meaning and longing that the song expresses." ...|$|E

2500|$|... gradual {{development}} of a bony secondary palate. Most books and articles interpret this as a prerequisite {{for the evolution of}} mammals' high metabolic rate, because it enabled these animals to eat and breathe at the same time. But some scientists point out that some modern ectotherms use a fleshy secondary palate to separate the mouth from the airway, and that a bony palate provides a surface on which the tongue can manipulate food, facilitating chewing rather than breathing. The interpretation of the bony secondary palate as an aid to chewing also suggests the {{development of}} a faster metabolism, because chewing reduces the size of food particles delivered to the stomach and can therefore speed their digestion. In mammals, the palate is formed by two specific bones, but various Permian therapsids had other combinations of bones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>places</b> to function as a palate.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{basically}} three major approaches to vocal pedagogy, all related {{to how the}} [...] mechanistic and psychological controls are employed within the act of singing. Some voice instructors advocate an extreme mechanistic approach that believes that singing is largely {{a matter of getting}} the right physical parts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>places</b> at the right time, and that correcting vocal faults is accomplished by calling direct attention to the parts which are not working well. On the other extreme, is the school of thought that believes that attention should never be directed to any part of the vocal mechanism—that singing is a matter of producing the right mental images of the desired tone, and that correcting vocal faults is achieved by learning to think the right thoughts and by releasing the emotions through interpretation of the music. Most voice teachers, however, believe that the truth lies somewhere in between the two extremes and adopt a composite of those two approaches.|$|E
2500|$|It was in 1896 that D. Ward King first {{dragged the}} road with an old frostbitten pump stock and an oak post. The {{improvement}} in the dirt roads it worked was dramatic. Until then, {{the only way to}} firm up dirt roads had been to dump layers of stone on them and then press it in with a heavy roller to make a road surface resistant to turning into muck after every rain. This method was fairly effective, but it was also labor-intensive and expensive. These stone-permeated roads were called [...] "macadamized roads". These roads took their name from their Scotch inventor, John Loudon McAdam. Using his method, roads were covered with several layers of stone, starting with large ones and then reducing their size in each successive layer. The stones in the first level would be {{about the size of a}} human head. The stones in the next layer would be about the size of a fist. The final layer would be of stones of about the size of golf balls. It was grueling work to haul this heavy stone to the places needed, to unload it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>places</b> and then to spread it evenly over the road surface with only horse-drawn wagons and hand-held shovels and rakes. Further, in the days before powered stone crushers, there was the additional and very arduous task of smashing much bigger rocks down to the right size for use in the respective layers. This work came to be known as [...] "making the big ones into the small ones." [...] Men did it by hand by smashing large rocks with sledgehammers. In many states, convicts did this work and sometimes even built these macadamized roads by working on the roads themselves. When these convict crews worked directly on these roads, necessarily outside the walls of the prison, each man was typically chained to the next to prevent runaways. These convict road crews became the infamous [...] "chain gangs" [...] of that day. In the days of horse power, this method was just too time-consuming and expensive to be practical for widespread use.|$|E
