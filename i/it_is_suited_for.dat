2500|$|The Tiger HAD (Hélicoptère d'Appui Destruction, in French or Helicoptero de Apoyo y Destrucción in Spanish for [...] "Support and Destruction Helicopter") {{version is}} {{essentially}} {{identical to the}} HAP version but better suited for operations in hot environments, with 14% more engine power available due to the upgraded Enhanced MTR390 engines (1,000kW / 1,341 shp) and a better ballistic protection, {{as a result of}} the specific requests made by the Spanish Army. It is equipped with the Hellfire II and the Spike ER anti-armour missiles. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>suited</b> <b>for</b> a support and fire suppression role. It was selected by the Spanish Army and the French Army Light Aviation (ALAT) decided to upgrade most of their HAP helicopters to the HAD variant. In December 2004, Spain ordered 24 of the HAD variant and France ordered 40 HADs. France's 40 HAD will cost €35.6m/unit (~US$48m) in 2012 prices. The French Army refer to those Tigers upgraded to the HAD variant as the Tiger Mk2.|$|E

2500|$|The [...]45-70 is a {{long-range}} caliber {{but it takes}} adequate knowledge of windage and elevation. The [...]45-70 retains great popularity among American hunters for the niche <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>suited</b> <b>for,</b> and is still offered by several commercial ammunition manufacturers. Even when loaded with modern smokeless powders, pressures are usually kept low for safety in antique rifles and their replicas. Rifles which reproduce the original designs take the original load but are not strong enough for anything with higher pressure. Various modern sporting rifles are chambered for the [...]45-70, {{and some of these}} benefit from judicious handloading of ammunition with markedly higher pressure and ballistic performance. In a rifle such as the Siamese Mauser (commonly converted to fire [...]45-70 due to it being the only Mauser 98 derivative designed to feed rimmed cartridges, and the limited availability of ammunition for its original 8×50mmR chambering) or a Ruger No. 1 single-shot rifle, can be handloaded to deliver good performance even on big African game. The [...]45-70 has also been used in double rifles since the development of the Colt 1878 rifle and the more modern replicas, like the Kodiak Mark IV.|$|E
