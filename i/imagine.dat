After he completed the script in 2002, <b>Imagine</b> Entertainment purchased it {{to be made by}} Universal Studios, with <b>Imagine</b> co-founder Ron Howard attached to direct. After Howard stepped down, his <b>Imagine</b> partner Brian Grazer began looking for a new director to helm the project, and ultimately hired Lee to do so. Principal photography began in June 2005 and concluded in August of that year; filming took place on location in New York City. Inside Man premiered in New York on March 20, 2006 before being released in North America on March 24, 2006. Upon release, the film received a generally positive critical response and was a commercial success, grossing over $184 million worldwide.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This entry {{elucidates}} causal and constitutive {{roles that}} {{various forms of}} <b>imagining</b> play in human action. Imagination influences more kinds of action than just pretend play. I distinguish different senses of the terms “imagining” and “imagination”: imagistic <b>imagining,</b> propositional <b>imagining,</b> and constructive <b>imagining.</b> Each variety of <b>imagining</b> makes its own characteristic contributions to action. Imagistic <b>imagining</b> can structure bodily movement. Propositional <b>imagining</b> interacts with desires to motivate pretend play and mimetic expressive action. And constructive imagination generates representations of possibilities and actions {{on the basis of}} which we choose what to do. [Version archived here is a penultimate draft. ...|$|R

50|$|Norton {{recognizes that}} {{identity}} is shaped {{not only by}} material conditions and lived experiences, but also by learners’ <b>imagined</b> futures and <b>imagined</b> identities. She asserts that learners invest in particular language and literacy practices because of their desire to be affiliated with a given target language community. While Benedict Anderson focused on the theorization {{of the nation as}} an <b>imagined</b> community, Norton considers that a wide range of <b>imagined</b> communities can be desirable, from membership in a local book club or successful professional network to an online transnational community. By <b>imagining</b> themselves allied with others across time and space, language learners are encouraged to seek opportunities for social interaction through diverse language and literacy practices. Norton argues that such <b>imagined</b> communities can be even more powerful than face-to-face communities in shaping the investment of learners. She argues further that a lack of awareness of learners’ <b>imagined</b> communities and <b>imagined</b> identities could hinder a teacher’s ability to construct productive language learning activities. The constructs of <b>imagined</b> communities and <b>imagined</b> identities have been further developed, and have proved productive in a range of research contexts.|$|R

40|$|Four studies {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} <b>imagining</b> intergroup contact on prejudice against people with schizophrenia. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that a neutral <b>imagined</b> contact task can have negative effects, compared to a control condition, even when paired with incidental positive information (Experiment 2). Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated, however, that an integrated positive <b>imagined</b> contact scenario does result in less intergroup anxiety and more positive attitudes, even toward this challenging group. Analyses of participants' descriptions of the <b>imagined</b> interactions in and across the first three studies confirm that positive and high quality <b>imagined</b> contact is important for reducing prejudice, but failing to ensure that <b>imagined</b> contact is positive may have deleterious consequences. We {{emphasize the importance of}} investigating the quality of the <b>imagined</b> contact experience, and discuss the implications for using <b>imagined</b> contact as a prejudice-reducing intervention. © The Author(s) 2011...|$|R

40|$|Although Gregory Currie {{is often}} {{presented}} as a strong defender of empathic simulation as part of spectator engagement, this paper questions the importance of empathy in Currie's philosophy of film. Currie's account of the imagination is too propositional, and his account of a more sensuous and experiential kind of <b>imagining</b> is found wanting. While giving a convincing account of impersonal <b>imagining</b> in relation to fiction film, Currie does not sufficiently explain what empathy is, and what relation it has {{to other forms of}} <b>imagining.</b> Simulation is primarily defined as impersonal, and perhaps more importantly, as conceptual and propositional in Currie's writings. This is perhaps most evident in his critique of personal <b>imagining,</b> where <b>imagining</b> seeing or <b>imagining</b> being becomes a self-reflexive form of <b>imagining</b> where the spectator also conceptualizes ‘I’ and ‘see’. This paper discusses the relation between personal <b>imagining</b> and empathy in Currie's account, and argues that he fails to show how empathy is of secondary importance for engagement in fiction film...|$|R

Humanity began experimenting with new technologies during the 1990s: among the discoveries made was the fact that all life and reality was made up of data. When demons began appearing across the world, chaos ensued with the rising of opposing factions supported by human sympathizers: servants of God who sought to bring order, and servants of Lucifer who spread chaos. The conflict culminated into the international launching of ICBMs, which devastated the world and left humanity at the mercy of demons. During the events of Shin Megami Tensei, a group of young people defied both God and Lucifer in creating a world where humans could flourish again.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMental {{practice}} with motor imagery improves motor performance, for example reducing {{the duration of}} goal-directed movements. However, {{it is not known}} whether an experimental session involving prolonged sequences of motor imagery induces mental fatigue and alters motor and mental performances. In this study, participants <b>imagined</b> 100 point-to-point arm movements combined with actual pointing movements every 10 or 50 <b>imagined</b> movements. Participants reported a subjective feeling of mental fatigue after <b>imagining</b> 100 pointing movements. When participants performed actual movements every 50 <b>imagined</b> movements, the duration of both actual and <b>imagined</b> movements increased {{at the end of the}} protocol. On the contrary, no change in actual and <b>imagined</b> movement duration was observed when participants performed actual movements every 10 <b>imagined</b> movements. These results suggested that the repetition of many <b>imagined</b> movements induced mental fatigue and altered the mental simulation and the actual execution processes of the movement. However, the regular execution of actual movements seemed to counteract the negative effect of mental fatigue as both actual and <b>imagined</b> movement duration remained constant with actual trials inserted between mental rehearsals. We suggest that during training or rehabilitation programs, actual movements should be executed and/or <b>imagined</b> movement duration should be controlled to avoid the negative effects of mental fatigue on motor performance...|$|R
40|$|The aim in {{this study}} was to examine the effect of {{interpersonal}} distance on causal attribution and the pleasantness of others' behavior. Undergraduates were presented with two fictional stories featuring an interaction between themselves and an <b>imagined</b> acquaintance of the same (first story) and different (second story) gender. In each situation, two types of behavior by the <b>imagined</b> acquaintance were manipulated: one in which the <b>imagined</b> acquaintance was physically close and the other in which the one was physically distant. Participants were then asked to rate the pleasantness of the <b>imagined</b> acquaintance, the degree of attribution to liking, and the degree of attribution to chance in each situation. In the situation in which the <b>imagined</b> acquaintance was near, female participants tended to rate an <b>imagined</b> female acquaintance as more pleasant than an <b>imagined</b> male one, whereas in the situation in which the <b>imagined</b> acquaintance was distant, they tended to rate the male more pleasant than the female. In contrast, male participants tended to rate both males and females that were near as more pleasant than those that were distant. Females attributed the behavior of an <b>imagined</b> acquaintance that was near to liking, and that of the <b>imagined</b> acquaintance that was distant to chance. These results indicate that the gender difference in causal attribution depends on both the interpersonal distance and the sex of an <b>imagined</b> acquaintance. They also show that the gender difference in the pleasantness of the <b>imagined</b> acquaintance was determined by causal attribution to both liking/chance and interpersonal distance...|$|R
50|$|Interactions between {{levels of}} {{knowledge}} and the imagination effect: The imagination effect occurs when <b>imagining</b> the instructional material {{is more effective than}} studying the instructional material.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of a Professional Doctorate in Systemic PracticeThis thesis is an inquiry into the practice of <b>imagining</b> of organisational futures. The aims of this research are to promote understanding of <b>imagining</b> as relational, discursive and dialogical practice in organisations, to develop opportunities for <b>imagining</b> in organisations drawing on systemic and social constructionist theories and practices, and to develop propositions informing systemic constructionist practice. It is a reflexive, qualitative, case and practice based research, informed by ethnographic sensibility, using Coordinated Management of Meaning (CMM) theory and discourse analysis as research methods. The focus {{of this research is}} not to solve problems but to make sense and create connections. This research promotes an understanding of <b>imagining</b> as relational, discursive practice and a critical appreciation of <b>imagining</b> in organisational theory and systemic constructionist practice with organisations, in particular the relevance of <b>imagining</b> in organisational opportunity, alignment and coordination, organisational decision making, and organisation development. Reflections on <b>imagining</b> practice are articulated as concepts of games of <b>imagining</b> expressing archetypical discursive forms of <b>imagining,</b> discursive reflexivity, a practice of reflexive evaluating of the unfolding talk for the emergent possibilities in it, and game changing, an expanding of possibilities for <b>imagining</b> from within a conversational situation. Drawing on reflections from theory and practice this research promotes the relevance of relational, discursive <b>imagining</b> for organisational task attainment and makes a case for advancing <b>imagining</b> practices through developing the participation in <b>imagining</b> processes and by foregrounding and institutionalising <b>imagining</b> in organisations. It argues that such developments can be of a transformational nature and positions systemic constructionist practice as a resource for such a development. This research contributes to systemic constructionist practice research by developing practice based frameworks that serve to orientate practitioners in the living moment of practising. It builds on established frameworks of systemic constructionist theory and practice, expands their relevance, and also invites critical and appreciative sensibilities in relation to systemic constructionist practice. This research contributes to a small body of empirical case research into organisational <b>imagining</b> informed by social constructionist positions and ethnographic sensibility...|$|R

EEG signals were acquired from eleven healthy subjects during four different <b>imagined</b> tasks performed with the right or left hand. Subjects were instructed to execute <b>imagined</b> grip movement at two different levels of force. Each task was executed 60 times in random order. The <b>imagined</b> grip force MRCP {{of the right}} or left hand was analyzed by superposition and averaging technology, a single-trial extraction method, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multiple comparisons. Significantly different features were observed among different <b>imagined</b> grip force tasks. These differences were used to decode <b>imagined</b> grip force parameters using Fisher linear discrimination analysis based on kernel function (k-FLDA) and support vector machine (SVM). Under the proposed experimental paradigm, the study showed that MRCP may characterize the dynamic processing {{that takes place in}} the brain during the planning, execution, and precision of a given <b>imagined</b> grip force task. This means that features related to MRCP can be used to decode <b>imagined</b> grip force parameters based on EEG. ANOVA and multiple comparisons of time–domain features for MRCP showed that movement-monitoring potentials (MMP) and specific interval (0 – 150 ms) average potentials to be significantly different among 4 different <b>imagined</b> grip force tasks.
