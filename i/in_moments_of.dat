25|$|As his {{division}} {{prepared to}} ship out, Mattis called in {{experts on the}} Middle East for cultural sensitivity training.

As an apparent example, he encouraged his Marines to grow mustaches to look more like the people they were working with.|$|E
25|$|Newman, who {{was only}} a few years younger than Keats and Shelley, was born into the Romantic generation, when Englishmen still wept <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> emotion. But he lived on into the age of the stiff upper lip, with the result that later generations, hearing of his tears on a visit to his mother's grave or at the {{funerals}} of old friends such as Henry Wilberforce, thought him not only sensitive but melancholy.|$|E

40|$|Arborists use {{formulas}} {{to estimate}} the risk of failure in trees with decay. The study investigates the appropriateness of using formulas to determine the risk of tree failure. Two variables were examined, whether trees improve wood toughness {{in the vicinity of}} mechanical stress concentrations, and how well the formulas estimate the loss <b>in</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> inertia due to decay. Red maple (Acer rubrum) callus wood toughness was consistently greater than for normal wood, but, in some cases, the formulas significantly underestimated the actual loss <b>in</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> inertia. The improvement of callus wood toughness is not related to increases in mechanical stress on the tree, but instead seems to be related to callus cell anatomy. ...|$|R

The cantor sang the piyyutim to melodies selected by their writer or by himself, thus introducing fixed melodies into synagogal music. The prayers he continued to recite as he had heard his predecessors recite them; but <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> inspiration he would give utterance to a phrase of unusual beauty, which, caught up by the congregants.|$|E
25|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} a Goa'uld host is a brief glowing of the eyes. This occurs when the Goa'uld first takes control and upon its death, as well as <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> extreme emotion or to add emphasis or intimidation. A Goa'uld-occupied host typically speaks in an eerily flanged, deepened register. However, the voice is not necessary, and Goa'uld can speak in a normal tone if they choose, usually {{when they need to}} deceive someone. The Goa'uld instill their hosts with superhuman strength, perfect health, and accelerated healing. The host's life is also lengthened into centuries, which the Goa'uld extend even further using a sarcophagus. However, repeated use of the sarcophagus has severe psychological consequences, and is believed to be a main factor in the Goa'uld's evil. Being host to a Goa'uld {{has been described as a}} living nightmare, and those humans who have been hosts for thousands of years are widely suspected to have gone insane.|$|E
25|$|The second Romana {{enjoys a}} more {{intimate}} relationship with the Doctor than her previous incarnation, {{to the point that}} some fans have assumed a romantic relationship with the Doctor. Although a relationship was never explicitly shown or intended by the writers, many fans have found the signs of a romantic relationship particularly evident in the story City of Death, perhaps reflecting the real-life romance between Tom Baker and Lalla Ward which blossomed during the production of that story, leading to their brief marriage in 1981. In many ways, she might be claimed to be the companion most like her Doctor (if Romana I were not more like the Doctor than her) – besides being of the same race and comparable intelligence, she occasionally mimics his sense of style, wields her own sonic screwdriver and can occasionally get the better of him <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> banter and more practical situations. As her practical experience develops, she also becomes more assured and capable in the situations she encounters.|$|E

25|$|Moses's {{power was}} further eroded by his {{association}} with the 1964 New York World's Fair. His projections for attendance of 70 million people for this event proved wildly optimistic, and generous contracts for fair executives and contractors made matters worse economically. Moses' repeated and forceful public denials of the fair's considerable financial difficulties {{in the face of}} evidence to the contrary eventually provoked press and governmental investigations, which found accounting irregularities. In his organization of the fair, Moses's reputation was now undermined by the same personal character traits that had worked in his favor in the past: disdain for the opinions of others and high-handed attempts to get his way <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> conflict by turning to the press. The fact that the fair was not sanctioned by the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE), the worldwide body supervising such events, would be devastating {{to the success of the}} event. Moses refused to accept BIE requirements, including a restriction against charging ground rents to exhibitors, and the BIE in turn instructed its member nations not to participate. The United States had already staged the sanctioned Century 21 Exposition in Seattle in 1962. According to the rules of the organization, no one nation could host more than one fair in a decade. The major European democracies, as well as Canada, Australia, and the Soviet Union, were all BIE members and they declined to participate, instead reserving their efforts for Expo 67 in Montreal.|$|E

500|$|Wilde's final {{play again}} {{returns to the}} theme of {{switched}} identities: the play's two protagonists engage in [...] "bunburying" [...] (the maintenance of alternative personas in the town and country) which allows them to escape Victorian social mores. Earnest is even lighter in tone than Wilde's earlier comedies. While their characters often rise to serious themes <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> crisis, Earnest lacks the by-now stock Wildean characters: there is no [...] "woman with a past", the principals are neither villainous nor cunning, simply idle cultivés, and the idealistic young women are not that innocent. Mostly set in drawing rooms and almost completely lacking in action or violence, Earnest lacks the self-conscious decadence found in The Picture of Dorian Gray and Salome.|$|E
500|$|Yeats {{used the}} {{occasion}} of his acceptance lecture at the Royal Academy of Sweden to present himself as a standard-bearer of Irish nationalism and Irish cultural independence. As he remarked, [...] "The theatres of Dublin were empty buildings hired by the English travelling companies, and we wanted Irish plays and Irish players. When we thought of these plays we thought of everything that was romantic and poetical, because the nationalism we had called up—the nationalism every generation had called up <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> discouragement—was romantic and poetical." [...] The prize led to {{a significant increase in}} the sales of his books, as his publishers Macmillan sought to capitalise on the publicity. For the first time he had money, and he was able to repay not only his own debts, but those of his father.|$|E

500|$|The end credits {{sequence}} {{was originally}} intended to feature images of printed circuit boards and other electronic components, to reflect the Andersons's early conception of the resurrected Captain Scarlet as being a [...] "mechanical man." [...] In the completed sequence, the end production credits are superimposed {{on a series of}} ten paintings, which depict Scarlet <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> extreme danger. In earlier episodes, these images are accompanied by the instrumental version of Barry Gray's Captain Scarlet theme music; in later ones, this is replaced by the lyrical version sung by The Spectrum. The paintings were produced by comic artist Ron Embleton, who would later illustrate the adult comic strips [...] "Oh, Wicked Wanda!" [...] and Sweet Chastity for Penthouse Magazine. In 2005, the Animation Art Gallery in London released licensed limited editions of the paintings signed by Francis Matthews, who had provided the voice of Captain Scarlet.|$|E

Peter Keough of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] " [...] may end up {{as one of the}} worst movies of 2015, but {{it is also one of}} the most entertaining". The Guardian writer Jordan Hoffman gave the film two stars, writing that [...] "it is bad, but it isn't THAT bad", and said: [...] "for a would-be cult [...] classic, this could have been much more". Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times was {{critical}} of [...] The Boy Next Door, calling it [...] "breathless, uninspired (...) junk that feels like the iffiest bits of a Lifetime movie and late-night cable schlock slapped together", calling Guzman's character boring. Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt similarly wrote that the film was a [...] "few deliciously bonkers bons mots dot the Lifetime-grade dialogue", while calling its script [...] "too timid to fully dive into the high camp it hints at". Despite negative reviews, Lopez has received praise. Richard Lawson from Vanity Fair wrote: [...] "Given the material, Lopez is actually pretty darn good in [...] the movie, taking it seriously enough that it's not irksomely arch camp, but also plenty aware that she's not doing Shakespeare. She's a joy to watch throughout." [...] Claudia Puig from USA Today stated that the movie was an improvement on her previous romantic comedies, calling Lopez [...] "believably powerful <b>in</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> physical conflict".|$|E
