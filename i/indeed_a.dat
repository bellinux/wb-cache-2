5|$|In 2010, a European science team {{investigated}} the star using the CORALIE spectrograph and collected seventeen spectra of WASP-44. From the spectra, radial velocity measurements were extrapolated. Analysis of collected CORALIE data {{ruled out the}} possibility that the detected radial velocity was caused by the blended spectrum of a spectroscopic binary star, supporting the possibility that the body orbiting WASP-44 was <b>indeed</b> <b>a</b> planet, designated WASP-44b.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{studies have}} {{supported}} the monophyly of three of these subfamilies (not Pereskioideae), but have not supported all of the tribes or even genera below this level; <b>indeed,</b> <b>a</b> 2011 study found only 39% of the genera in the subfamily Cactoideae sampled in the research were monophyletic. Classification of the cacti currently remains uncertain {{and is likely to}} change.|$|E

5|$|The more {{traditional}} taxonomy of the family, particularly the split into four groups, {{has been challenged}} by recent research.

5|$|A low calorie diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in many animals. This effect may involve {{a reduction in}} oxidative stress.

5|$|At {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the {{remnants}} of brick walls could indicate the presence of a mortuary temple, but the archaeological traces are so tenuous that any closer examination and more precise reconstruction is impossible today. The same goes for the ruins of a building several hundred metres away from the pyramid, and which might have been the valley temple. If this was <b>indeed</b> <b>a</b> valley temple, its east-west orientation would be unique in all pyramid complexes.|$|E
5|$|But the {{agreement}} broke down a month later. In late June, the defeated {{king and his}} small retinue left their temporary capital for Pagan. But on 1 July 1287, the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son Thihathu, the Viceroy of Prome. Anarchy ensued. Each region in the country which had not revolted broke away. No successor to Narathihapate, who could honor and enforce {{the terms of the}} treaty of Beijing, emerged. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>a</b> king would not emerge until May 1289.|$|E

5|$|If Mac Scelling was <b>indeed</b> <b>a</b> {{member of}} the Meic Somairlethe {{descendants}} of Somairlethis relationship may cast light upon Somairle's struggles in the Isles. For instance, Mac Scelling's cooperation with Muirchertach could be evidence that Guðrøðr faced united opposition from Somairle and Muirchertach. In fact, there is evidence indicating that Guðrøðr and Muirchertach were indeed at odds {{at some point in}} the 1150s or 1160s, as the former appears to have briefly gained the kingship of Dublin at the expense of Muirchertach's authority as overlord.|$|E
5|$|In 1111, {{according}} to the eleventhfourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen, Domnall mac Taidc seized the kingship of the Isles by force. This annal-entry is the only notice of Domnall's lordship in the Isles preserved by Irish sources. This could indicate that the chronicle's aforesaid account of the petitioning of Muirchertach is incorrectly dated, and actually refers to about 1111. However, {{the fact that the}} chronicle places the petitioning during a period of new-found Uí Briain dominance in the region, before Magnús' arrival in the Isles, and {{at about the same time}} as Amlaíb's death, suggests that the chronicle's chronology concerning these events is sound, and that Domnall's seizure of the kingship in 1111 was <b>indeed</b> <b>a</b> return to the Isles.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the Estonian {{astronomer}} Ernst Öpik gave {{a distance}} determination {{that supported the}} theory that the Andromeda Nebula is <b>indeed</b> <b>a</b> distant extra-galactic object. Using the new 100inch Mt. Wilson telescope, Edwin Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too distant {{to be part of the}} Milky Way. In 1936 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day.|$|E

5|$|In January 2011, the closely {{orbiting}} planet Kepler-10b {{was confirmed}} in {{the orbit of}} the star Kepler-10 after measurements of its transiting behavior (where it crosses in front of Kepler-10, periodically dimming it) and a radial velocity effect detected in Kepler-10's spectrum provided the information needed {{to prove that it}} was <b>indeed</b> <b>a</b> planet. An additional, longer-period dimming was detected in Kepler-10's spectrum, suggesting that a second planet existed in the system; however, there remained the possibility that this signal could have some other cause, and that the transit event was a false positive. Attempts to measure the radial velocity effects of this object, now named KOI 072.02, were fruitless; therefore, to rule out false positive scenarios, the Kepler team used a technique called Blender.|$|E

5|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that the Central American squirrel monkey was just a population of a South American species of squirrel monkey brought to Central America by humans. Evidence for this theory included the very small range of the Central American squirrel monkey and the large gap from the range of any other squirrel monkey species. A study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA demonstrated that the Central American squirrel monkey is <b>indeed</b> <b>a</b> separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species long ago – at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago.|$|E

Since 1980, {{a sufficient number of}} coins have been found to show that he was <b>indeed</b> <b>a</b> historical figure.
