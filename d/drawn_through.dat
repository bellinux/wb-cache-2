5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be <b>drawn</b> <b>through</b> the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E

5|$|The global {{definition}} of the Earth's field {{is based on a}} mathematical model. If a line is <b>drawn</b> <b>through</b> the center of the Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey seals. The harbour seals have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their first white coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour seals off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been <b>drawn</b> <b>through</b> a ducted propeller.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{came to be}} {{regarded}} as a sin in Christian Europe and was condemned at the Council of Arles in 452 as the work of the Devil. In the Middle Ages, the Church had drawn-out discussions as to when the desire for martyrdom was suicidal, {{as in the case of}} martyrs of Córdoba. Despite these disputes and occasional official rulings, Catholic doctrine was not entirely settled on the subject of suicide until the later 17th century. A criminal ordinance issued by Louis XIV of France in 1670 was extremely severe, even for the times: the dead person's body was <b>drawn</b> <b>through</b> the streets, face down, and then hung or thrown on a garbage heap. Additionally, all of the person's property was confiscated.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, Takechi {{followed}} Susugigawa with a noh-kyōgen {{version of}} Junji Kinoshita's Yūzuru. Yūzuru {{is one of}} the most successful Japanese post-World War II plays, having received over a thousand performances at schools and theaters both within Japan and internationally since its debut in 1949. Composer Ikuma Dan wrote an opera version of the play in 1952. Since its premiere, Dan's opera has been performed more than 550 times, making it possibly the most popular opera written in Japanese. Dan was recruited to write the original music for Takechi's production of the play. Dan combined the noh-style solo vocal lines with a Western orchestra and chorus. On the same program as Yūzuru was another Takechi-directed kyōgen, Higashi wa Higashi (East is East), a parody of the kyōgen style. Among the innovations Takechi made in this play was the inclusion of a former Takarazuka actress in the usually all-male kyōgen cast. In the ultra-conservative noh and kyōgen communities, simply appearing in a rival school's production could result in an actor's excommunication from the profession. Because of the public attention <b>drawn</b> <b>through</b> Takechi's relentless publicity work and communication with the media, punitive actions against actors who worked with Takechi were avoided.|$|E

50|$|Fan Coil Unit design falls principally {{into two}} main types: blow <b>through</b> and <b>draw</b> <b>through.</b> As the names suggest, {{in the first}} type the fans are fitted such that they blow through the heat exchanger, {{and in the other}} type the fans are fitted after the coil such that they <b>draw</b> air <b>through</b> it. <b>Draw</b> <b>through</b> units are {{considered}} thermally superior, as ordinarily they make better use of the heat exchanger. However they are more expensive, as they require a chassis to hold the fans whereas a blow-through unit typically consists of a set of fans bolted straight to a coil.|$|R

25|$|The {{angle of}} {{inclination}} formed between the neck and shaft of the femur, (collodiaphysial angle), varies with age—about 150° in the newborn, it gradually decreases to 126-128° in adults, to reach 120° in old age. Pathological changes in this angle results in abnormal posture of the leg: A small angle produces coxa vara and a large angle in coxa valga; the latter is usually combined with genu varum and coxa vara leads genu valgum. Additionally, a line <b>drawn</b> <b>through</b> the femoral neck superimposed on a line <b>drawn</b> <b>through</b> the femoral condyles forms an angle, the torsion angle, which {{makes it possible for}} flexion movements of the hip joint to be transposed into rotary movements of the femoral head. Abnormally increased torsion angles results in a limb turned inward and a decreased angle in a limb turned outward; both cases resulting in a reduced range of a persons mobility.|$|E
