An angry Borat accidentally reveals his real motive for {{traveling}} to California. Azamat becomes livid at Borat's deception, and the situation escalates into a fully nude brawl with homoerotic undertones, which spills out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> a crowded elevator, and ultimately into a packed convention ballroom. The two are finally separated by security guards.|$|E
5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to Darryl Dawkins' autobiography, Bavetta was officiating an NBA game {{during the}} mid-1970s between the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets with Earl Strom as his partner for that game. Bavetta {{overruled}} Strom on a crucial last-second personal foul call against the Nets, {{which would have}} been a victory for the 76ers. When the game ended and players were walking to their respective locker rooms, the door to the referees' locker room flew open and Bavetta came staggering out. His uniform was allegedly ripped and he was wearing a big welt over his eye, running to get away from Strom. Strom stepped out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> and hollered after Bavetta, [...] "You'll take another one of my fucking calls again, right, you motherfucker?" [...] Strom was fined for the incident.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the tension}} between them, James leaves {{to go for a}} drive and {{purchase}} a pack of cigarettes for Kristen; before he departs, he starts a fire in the hearth. Shortly after he leaves, Kristen realizes the chimney flue is closed, and attempts to open it; while she does this, smoke emanating from the fire triggers a smoke alarm. Kristen attempts to disarm the smoke alarm when she is startled by another knock at the door; she drops the alarm on the floor and retreats to the bedroom, unnerved. She calls James' cellphone from the landline, but their call is cut short. When she returns to the living room, she sees the smoke alarm now sitting on a chair, and realizes someone else has been in the house. When she hears a noise from the backyard, she arms herself with a knife, and opens the curtains to find a man wearing a sack mask, staring at her. Panicked, she stumbles <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> and watches as the front door opens. When she goes to push [...] the door closed, she sees the blonde woman outside, now wearing a doll mask. After locking the door, Kristen hides in the bedroom and hears people outside banging violently against the walls of the house.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{arriving}} at a polo mansion. She comes out from the car wearing a vest, jeans and showing her midriff. She starts singing while her boyfriend welcomes her. They walk past a barn, where a polo player is sitting. They {{look at each other}} briefly and she starts to sing in a balcony, watching the second man with a pair of binoculars. At {{the end of the first}} chorus, her boyfriend comes and puts a studded necklace around her neck, as a surprise gift. Until the end of the second chorus, we see scenes of Spears singing and watching the polo player as he gets ready. When the bridge begins, Spears arrives at a match wearing a white dress and a large hat. She looks at the polo player over her shoulder and sings the lines [...] "I got my eye on you / And I canâ€™t let you get away". When the match ends, she leaves and the second man follows her. They flirt inside a hallway and leave. Her boyfriend notices her absence, walks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> and sees her necklace on the floor. The video ends with Spears and the second man walking into the sunset.|$|E

500|$|Not all Capitol hauntings {{are related}} to people who worked there. The [...] "Demon Cat" [...] is alleged to prowl the halls of Congress, and make {{appearances}} just before a national tragedy or change in Presidential administration. It was first seen {{in the early part}} of the 19th century, and a night watchman shot at it in 1862. It has also been seen by other night watchmen and members of the Capitol Police. It appeared before the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the October 1929 stock market crash, and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The cat has not only been seen in the halls, but has repeatedly appeared in Washington's Tomb. The Tomb (two levels below the crypt beneath the Capitol Rotunda) was an original feature of the Capitol, planned as a resting place for George Washington and members of his family. The Washington family politely declined the offer. The Tomb stands empty, although from 1865 to 2009 (when it was moved to the United States Capitol Visitor Center) the Lincoln catafalque was stored there. The specters of at least two soldiers are also said to haunt the Capitol. A few eyewitnesses have claimed that whenever an individual lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda, a World War I doughboy momentarily appears, salutes, then disappears. A second apparition, which eyewitnesses say is the ghost of an American Revolutionary War soldier, has also appeared at the Washington Tomb. According to several stories, the soldier appears, moves around the Lincoln catafalque, and then passes out the door <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> before disappearing.|$|E

Suddenly Dick Bavetta ran across floor to the scorer's table, saying, [...] "No! No! I got a push off against McGinnis!" [...] Strom then {{challenged}} Bavetta, [...] "Are you overruling my call? I got pushing off right here!" [...] Bavetta insisted, which reversed Strom's call and the Nets wound up with the victory. With the game over, players were walking to their respective locker rooms when the door to the referees' locker room flew open and Dick Bavetta came staggering out. His uniform was ripped and he was wearing a big welt over his eye, running to get away from Strom.

2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{his days in}} the isolation ward, Lukwiya would sit {{with members of the}} WHO, CDC and other medical teams that had set up in the hospital compound to offer assistance and take blood samples that allowed them to map the course of the disease. [...] His main question for them was how to stop his staff members from becoming infected. [...] The likely explanation in most cases are momentary lapses. [...] Health workers at St. Mary's worked 14 hours shifts for weeks in a row while in layers of protective clothing that were stifling in the equatorial country. [...] All that would be required for infection is for a health worker to lose focus for a moment and, after touching a patient, slip a gloved finger under their mask to scratch an itchy nose or rub an eye. [...] One infected St. Mary's health worker who may have been infected in this way was nurse Simon Ajok. [...] In the early morning of 20 November, Ajok was in the Ebola ward and critical, bleeding from both his nose and gums. [...] Fighting to breathe, Ajok pulled off his oxygen mask and coughed violently, sending a fine spray of blood and mucus against the nearby wall. [...] He then astonished and terrified the night-shift by rising to his feet and staggering <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway.</b> [...] The night nurse on duty called Dr. Lukwiya for help. [...] Woken out of bed, Lukwiya put on protective clothing, mask, cap, gown, apron and two pairs of gloves, but not goggles or a face shield to protect the eyes. [...] Explanations for this range from grogginess at being newly awoken or haste to reach a colleague that he had helped train. [...] While it will never be known for certain, the care for Simon Ajok, who died one hour after the physician arrived, is the most likely candidate for Lukwiya's infection.|$|E
