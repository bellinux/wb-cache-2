5|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first star to refuse. Jacques Anquetil {{called it}} a lottery after {{puncturing}} 13km from the end in 1958 and never took it seriously again.|$|E
5|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{was first}} investigated and described by Luke Howard in the 1810s, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> one {{to name the}} phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|As a youth, Ezeh {{was unable}} to play {{football}} {{because he was too}} big for the local leagues according to Grand Rapids area officials. As a sophomore running back for the 2003 Catholic Central Cougars football team, Ezeh had several 100-yard games as well as multiple touchdown games, even though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> primary weapon in the backfield. Ezeh was {{also a member of the}} Cougars rugby team that placed 11th at the 2004 United States High School Rugby National Championships.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Daniel Biro from Hawk Nelson.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only {{prominent}} Spanish {{politician who}} had offshore companies.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> same George Johnson {{who played}} {{saxophone}} with The Wolverines in 1924.|$|R
5|$|Even though Thomas is {{the first}} known Bishop of Finland, {{it is certain that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first bishop overall. An unnamed Bishop of Finland is {{mentioned}} dead in a letter by Pope Innocent III already in 1209. A 15th-century chronicle names bishops Henry, Rodulff and Folquinus before him, but no indisputable records survive of them.|$|E
5|$|Fransen {{failed to}} explain to the Bradleys that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> owner of the concept, and Chamberlin was unhappy with the fact that someone {{overseas}} was copying his idea. After some acrimony between the two parties, a deal was struck between them in 1966, whereby they would both continue to manufacture instruments independently. Bradmatic renamed themselves Streetly Electronics in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Leonid Kinskey as Sascha, the Russian {{bartender}} {{infatuated with}} Yvonne. He {{was born into}} a Jewish family in Russia and had immigrated to the United States. He told Aljean Harmetz, author of Round Up the Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca, that he was cast because he was Bogart's drinking buddy. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first choice for the role; he replaced Leo Mostovoy, who was deemed not funny enough.|$|E
50|$|Note: <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> same as Kato Hideki, {{who plays}} bass in Ground Zero.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Alexander Ross of the Aberdeen doctors, who {{remained}} in Scotland and died in 1639.|$|R

5|$|On August 26, 1823, Joseph F. Goodrich, an American missionary, {{made the}} first {{recorded}} ascent in a single day; however, a small arrangement of stones he observed suggested <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first human on the summit. He recorded four ecosystems as he travelled from base to summit, and also visited Lake Waiau.|$|E
5|$|Plante {{subsequently}} designed his own {{and other}} goaltenders' masks. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first NHL goaltender known to wear a face mask. Montreal Maroons' Clint Benedict wore a crude leather version in 1930 to protect a broken nose, but Plante introduced the mask as everyday equipment, {{and it is now}} mandatory equipment for goaltenders.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} for American breeders was the {{presence}} of the blood of Lexington in their breeding programs. Lexington's pedigree on his dam's side was suspect in the eyes of British racing authorities, and as he had been the leading sire of racehorses in the United States for 16years, his descendants were numerous. Most American-bred Thoroughbreds traced to Lexington at least once, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only horse with suspect bloodlines registered in the American Stud Book.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> {{same person}} as the {{mnemonics}} master and {{managing director of}} Likanas publisher of the same name.|$|R

50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> same player as the Bristol Rovers footballer of {{the same}} era, who played for Rovers between 1911 and 1913.|$|R
5|$|Adam Michael Goldstein {{was born}} on March 30, 1973, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents, Andrea and Herbert – {{both of whom were}} Jewish – had been unable to {{conceive}} children naturally, and they had adopted Goldstein's older sister Lana a year before his birth. Goldstein's mother left her husband temporarily after she caught him having extramarital sex with a man. During this time she had an affair herself, and she found out she was pregnant with Adam after returning to her husband. While heavily pregnant, she discovered her husband had been adulterous a second time, and then she angrily disclosed to him that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> biological father of her baby.|$|E
5|$|After the Duke of Northumberland's {{attainder}} {{the entire}} Dudley inheritance had disappeared. His sons {{had to start}} from scratch in rebuilding the family fortunes, as they had renounced any rights to their father's former possessions or titles when their own attainders had been lifted in January 1558. Robert Dudley financed the lifestyle expected of a royal favourite by large loans from City of London merchants until in April 1560 Elizabeth granted him his first export licence, worth £6,000 p.a. He also received some of his father's lands, but since <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> family heir {{it was a matter of}} some difficulty to find a suitable estate for his intended peerage. In June 1563 the Queen granted him Kenilworth Manor, Castle, and Park, together with the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk in North Wales. Other grants were to follow. Eventually, Leicester and his elder brother Ambrose, Earl of Warwick, came to preside over the greatest aristocratic interest in the West Midlands and North Wales.|$|E
5|$|Carlos Menem {{ran for a}} {{new term}} as {{president}} in 2003, and Eduardo Duhalde tried to prevent it. Instead of holding primary elections within the PJ, the 2003 elections used {{a variant of the}} Ley de Lemas. All the Peronist candidates were allowed to run in the general election, using their own tickets. Although Kirchner ran for president with Duhalde's support, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> president's first choice. Trying to prevent a third term for Menem, Duhalde approached Santa Fe governor Carlos Reutemann and Córdoba governor José Manuel de la Sota; Reutemann declined, and De la Sota did not run because he was insufficiently popular. Duhalde also unsuccessfully approached Mauricio Macri, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Felipe Solá, and Roberto Lavagna, all of whom refused to run. Duhalde initially resisted supporting Kirchner, fearing that Kirchner would ignore him if elected. Kirchner run on the Front for Victory ticket, one of the several fronts put up by the PJ. Since Kirchner was identified with the centre-left, Duhalde appointed the centre-right Daniel Scioli as his vice-presidential candidate. Only a handful of Peronist governors supported either candidate; most remained neutral, awaiting the election to forge a relationship with the victor.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> William Lynch who {{allegedly}} made the William Lynch speech in 1712, as {{the date on}} the apocryphal speech precedes his birth by 30 years.|$|R
50|$|Paul Mellor {{appears to}} have been a first-time {{candidate}} for public office. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> same person as a Paul Mellor from Niagara Falls who was accused of murder in 2009.|$|R
50|$|A user named 'torvalds' {{creates a}} file named 'tekken' under the {{directory}} named 'videogames'. A user named 'wozniak' attempts to {{delete the file}} named 'tekken' but he cannot, since <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> owner.|$|R
5|$|Castelli {{is largely}} {{ignored in the}} historiography of Argentina. Most historians focus instead on the {{disputes}} between Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra in the Junta, with Castelli described in passing as a supporter of Moreno. Despite of {{his role in the}} May Revolution, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> clear leader of it, as José Gervasio Artigas was for the Cry of Asencio or Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla for the Cry of Dolores. The May Revolution was instead the result of the convergence of diverse factions that shared the desire to remove the viceroy, and different historians highlight different specific factions. Castelli is largely ignored in Bolivia as well. His support of indigenous rights—still an ongoing issue in the country—and his religious ideas strongly affect the way he is perceived there.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lyoto Machida's {{knockout}} of Thiago Silva, Dana White {{indicated that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> number one contender for a title shot. Instead, a scheduled fight between former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Quinton Jackson and Keith Jardine would determine Machida's title fate. A victory for Jackson would earn him {{a fight with}} champion Rashad Evans, but a win for Jardine would mean Machida will be awarded with a title shot. Jackson won the fight via unanimous decision, but torn ligaments in his jaw forced the former champion out of the bout. Instead, Machida will challenge Evans for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship at UFC 98. Jackson will retain his title shot against the winner of that match upon returning from injury. Following the loss to Machida, Thiago Silva was scheduled to return to action against former champion Forrest Griffin at UFC 101, but his opponent was later changed to Keith Jardine.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the success}} of Dynasty Warriors 3, Omega Force began {{development}} on the sequel, Dynasty Warriors 4, and its expansions. The fourth game in the series was the first to introduce an Empires expansion, but it wasn’t designed by the same person who designed Dynasty Warriors 4, Tomohiko Sho. Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> designer for all of the Dynasty Warriors games he was involved in the production for them, usually as the planner. Omega Force works under Koei as an internal development team and have mainly concentrated on the Dynasty Warriors series and the Samurai Warriors series. Similarities have been pointed out between the two series, such as the Xtreme Legends and Empires expansions, as well as a similar voice cast that has been used throughout a number of the games from each series. Repeated voices between games include Beau Billingslea, Steven Jay Blum and Richard Epcar.|$|E
50|$|Christian invites Ana for coffee, but {{he leaves}} abruptly, saying <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> man for her. Christian later sends Ana first edition copies of two Thomas Hardy novels, {{including}} Tess of the d'Urbervilles, as a gift.|$|R
50|$|Ibn Aknin {{is known}} to have known Maimonides in North Africa, and draws on many of the same sources, sharing a similar outlook. But <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Joseph ben Judah to whom the Guide is addressed.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> {{same person}} as the John Matteson who, as a {{professor}} of speech at Los Angeles City College in 2008, allegedly barred a student from giving a classroom speech in opposition to same-sex marriage.|$|R
5|$|In 1966 an {{exhibition}} at Leeds College of Art of paintings by the Cyprus-born British artist Stass Paraskos, entitled Lovers and Romances, was prosecuted by the City of Leeds {{police and the}} Director of Public Prosecutions under the Vagrancy Acts of 1828 and 1837, and the Obscene Publications Act 1959. When the exhibition opened it was allegedly visited by a local school group, the leader of which objected to an image depicting a woman masturbating a man. The exhibition was raided {{by the police and}} closed down. Despite luminaries of the art world speaking in Paraskos's defence, including Herbert Read and Norbert Lynton, and a message of support from Britain's Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, Paraskos lost the trial and was fined twenty-five pounds. The case was later cited in the report of a working party convened in 1968, under the chairmanship of John Montgomerie, by the Arts Council of Great Britain, to review the obscenity laws in England and Wales. In this report it was suggested the artist should not have been prosecuted in this case, even if the works of art were deemed obscene, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> publisher as defined by the Obscene Publications Act.|$|E
5|$|In September 1928 Britten went as a boarder to Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk. At {{the time}} he felt unhappy there, even writing in his diary of contemplating suicide or running away: he hated being {{separated}} from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> target of it. He remained there {{for two years and}} in 1930, he won a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London; his examiners were the composers John Ireland and Ralph Vaughan Williams and the college's harmony and counterpoint teacher, S P Waddington.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{had never}} seriously {{considered}} coaching, but he agreed take the head coaching {{position with the}} Lakers in 1994 at Buss' request. In 1992, Buss had given Johnson a contract that paid him $14 million a year, as payback for all the years <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> league's highest paid player. Although Johnson's retirement prior to the 1992–93 NBA season voided this contract, Buss insisted that he still be paid. It was this arrangement that allowed Johnson to coach the team without receiving any additional salary. After Johnson ended his coaching stint, Buss sold him a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team executive.|$|E
500|$|... "Wonderful, then I'll {{be able to}} see you," [...] {{says the}} girland the Tramp is struck by what may happen if she were to gain her sight and {{discover}} that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> wealthy man she imagines.|$|R
5|$|Liu Kang is {{also one}} of the lead {{characters}} in the 1996 animated series , voiced by Brian Tochi. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> protagonist therein as opposed to the game storyline, instead sharing this role with several other Earthrealm heroes.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> {{the highest}} ranking Punjabi and Sikh in the {{political}} party, which is dominated by Tamils.
