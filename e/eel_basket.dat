50|$|An eel buck or <b>eel</b> <b>basket</b> {{is a type}} of fish trap {{that was}} {{prevalent}} in the River Thames in England up to the 20th century. It was used particularly to catch eels, which were a staple part of the London diet.|$|E
40|$|The {{comparative}} {{sustainability of}} seven Tagus estuary fisheries – beam trawl, boat dredge, nets for glass eel, gill nets, <b>eel</b> <b>basket,</b> squid jig and octopus traps – is analysed using RAPFISH. This technique relies upon ordination of scored attributes, grouped in fields that cover ecological, economic, social, technological and ethical sustainability, performed using multi-dimensional scaling. Fisheries were analysed within each discipline and using all the attributes for an interdisciplinary approach. Leverage analysis {{is used to}} determine how much each attribute influences the ordination. Concerning the cross-discipline ordination, the studied fisheries lay around the mid-range of sustainability. The most sustainable fishery is octopus traps (57 %) followed by squid jig (56 %) that has the same results except for technological dimension. <b>Eel</b> <b>basket</b> and gill nets show the next best sustainability scores (55 % and 53 %, respectively). Glass eel fishery presents a poor sustainability (46 %), lying close to the boat dredge and beam trawl, the fisheries with lowest sustainability (44 % and 43 %, respectively). The low leverage values show that ordinations are truly multivariate and that the results are not dominated by any one attribute. More studies should be conducted on the Tagus estuary fisheries in order to get more information about resources, fishers and their activity, which will contribute to improve sustainability...|$|E

25|$|Local Māori legends {{explained}} the boulders as {{the remains of}} <b>eel</b> <b>baskets,</b> calabashes, and kumara washed ashore from the wreck of Arai-te-uru, a large sailing canoe. This legend tells of the rocky shoals that extend seaward from Shag Point as being the petrified hull of this wreck and a nearby rocky promontory as being {{the body of the}} canoe's captain. In 1848 W.B.D. Mantell sketched the beach and its boulders, more numerous than now. The picture is now in the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington. The boulders were described in 1850 colonial reports and numerous popular articles since that time. In more recent times they have become a popular tourist attraction, often described and pictured in web pages and tourist guides.|$|R
50|$|Niewójt {{suggests}} that the account in William Buckley's reminiscences of an encounter with a tribe numbering about 80 people, for trading purposes, that took place at Bermongo on the Barwon River was probably one dealing with the Yan Yan Gurt clan, perhaps exchanging the prized tuupuurn <b>eel</b> for <b>baskets</b> of tubers.|$|R

50|$|The Responsibility of Raising a Child was {{designed}} by Rick Bartow in 2004, cast in 2009, and completed in 2010 before being installed {{at the intersection of}} Southwest 5th Avenue and Taylor Street in the Portland Transit Mall. Cascade Fine Arts Foundry, based in Damascus, Oregon, served as the sculpture's foundry. The sculpture depicts several animals and objects being carried {{on the back of a}} coyote ("the trickster"), including a grandmother mask with a tattoo that Bartow's mother observed on the face of an elder healing woman in Siletz, Oregon, a pair of salmon, a Pacific lamprey <b>eel</b> feeds, a <b>basket</b> holding a baby (Bartow's daughter), and several birds, including a killdeer, an eagle with outstretched wings, and a raven. A moon mask on the eagle's tail symbolizes women, and a sun mark on its wing represents men.|$|R
500|$|During the 1930s, over [...] of willow {{were being}} grown commercially on the Levels. Largely {{because of the}} {{replacement}} of baskets by plastic bags and cardboard boxes, the industry has severely declined since the 1950s. By {{the end of the}} 20thcentury only about [...] were grown commercially, near the villages of Burrowbridge, Westonzoyland, and North Curry. The Somerset Levels is now the only area in the UK where basket willow is grown commercially. For weaving, the species Salix triandra (almond willow, black maul) is grown, while Salix viminalis (common osier) is ideal for handles, bases, and the structural members in furniture and hurdles. Historically willow was used to make salmon traps or [...] "putchers". Products including <b>baskets,</b> <b>eel</b> traps (kypes), lobster pots, and furniture were widely made from willow throughout the area in the recent past. Among the more unusual products still made are passenger baskets for hot air balloons, the frames inside the Bearskins worn by the regiments of the Grenadier Guards, and an increasing number of willow coffins.|$|R
