25|$|If a {{compression}} {{scheme is}} lossless—that is, {{you can always}} recover the entire original message by decompressing—then a compressed message has the same quantity of information as the original, but communicated in fewer characters. That is, it has more information, or a higher entropy, per character. This means a compressed message has less redundancy. Roughly speaking, Shannon's source coding theorem says that a lossless compression scheme cannot compress messages, on average, {{to have more than}} one bit of <b>information</b> <b>per</b> bit of message, but that any value less than one bit of <b>information</b> <b>per</b> bit of message can be attained by employing a suitable coding scheme. The entropy of a message per bit multiplied by the length of that message is a measure of how much total information the message contains.|$|E
25|$|Ray Kurzweil postulates {{a law of}} {{accelerating}} {{returns in}} which the speed of technological change (and more generally, all evolutionary processes) increases exponentially, generalizing Moore's Law {{in the same manner}} as Moravec's proposal, and also including material technology (especially as applied to nanotechnology), medical technology and others. Between 1986 and 2007, machines' application-specific capacity to compute <b>information</b> <b>per</b> capita roughly doubled every 14 months; the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers has doubled every 18 months; the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months; and the world's storage capacity per capita doubled every 40 months.|$|E
500|$|Show creator Daniel Knauf's {{original}} story {{pitch to}} HBO included elaborate character biographies, which {{he gave to}} the actors, the writers and the studio as an overview over the series' intended plot.

After the show's cancellation, the writers revealed future character arcs and forwarded all original biographies to fans {{as part of the}} show's so-called [...] "Pitch Document".

30|$|Communication cost, {{in terms}} of energy {{consumption}} and bandwidth, is the major design consideration of a resource-limited networked multi-agent system, and can be approximately evaluated by the volume of information exchange during the decentralized consensus optimization process. Ignoring the extra burden of coordinating the network, for each agent, the communication cost {{is proportional to the}} number of iterations multiplied by the volume of <b>information</b> exchange <b>per</b> iteration. Therefore, reducing the <b>information</b> exchange <b>per</b> iteration is of critical importance to the design of lightweight algorithms.|$|R
