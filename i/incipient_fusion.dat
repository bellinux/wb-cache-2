40|$|The {{results of}} {{intensive}} {{studies indicate that}} shock-metamorphic effects, characteristic of meteorite impact and virtually identical to those observed in Apollo samples, are common in fragments of the Luna- 16 soil sample from Mare Fecunditatis. Two types of shock effects are present: (1) deformation and partial melting features in rock and mineral fragments (1 - 2 percent of fragments); and (2) heterogeneous glasses and glassy breccias produced by shock melting (70 - 80 percent of fragments). Shock effects were observed in pyroxene (deformation twin lamellae, multiple planar shock lamellae, extreme mosaicism, partial isotropization); in plagioclase (planar shock lamellae, complete isotropization to form maskelynite); and in basalt fragments (plagioclase isotropization, selective partial melting). The glasses exhibit several characteristics of shock melting, especially: (1) diversity in chemical composition; (2) association with shock mineral fragments and Ni-Fe spherules; and (3) heterogeneous schlieren and <b>incipient</b> <b>fusion</b> of mineral inclusions. Two types of source rocks {{are present in the}} Luna- 16 sample; basaltic (85 - 90 percent) and feldspathic (10 - 15 percent). The basaltic rocks are predominant and generally occur as unshocked fragments, indicating that they form the bedrock underlying Mare Fecunditatis...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the surface roughness of pearlitic grey cast iron discs on the formation of tribofilms {{and the evolution of}} the friction coefficient during a ring on disc tribotest with the addition of magnetite and magnetite–graphite nanopowders as interfacial media was investigated. The roughness parameters of the cast iron discs were varied by electro discharge machining (EDM) and grinding processes, producing four distinct surface roughness conditions. The evolution of the friction coefficient, however, did not reach the steady state for most of the samples {{and the role of the}} surface roughness on the friction coefficient could not be identified. Focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy on the cast iron discs was carried out to investigate the microstructure of the discs near the tribosurface. These results showed that the EDM process not only varied the surface roughness, but also changed the microstructure of the cast iron discs, promoting the <b>incipient</b> <b>fusion</b> of the cast iron surface, with the formation of ridges and casting defects (pores). As a result, a layer of rapidly solidified metal with a dendritic microstructure was formed near to the surface of the EDMed discs. CAPE...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{perturbations}} {{associated with}} seismic slip on faults may significantly affect the dynamic friction and the mechanical energy release during earthquakes. This paper investigates {{details of the}} coseismic temperature increases associated with the elastodynamic propagation of shear cracks and effects of fault heating on the dynamic fault strength. Self-similar solutions are presented for the temperature evolution on a surface of a mode II shear crack and a self-healing pulse rupturing at a constant velocity. The along-crack temperature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, {{the ratio of the}} crack thickness to the width of the conductive thermal boundary layer, (w) over bar. For "thick'' cracks, or at early stages of rupture ((w) over bar > 1), the local temperature on the crack surface is directly proportional to the amount of slip. For "thin'' cracks, or at later times ((w) over bar < 1), the temperature maximum shifts toward the crack tip. For faults having slip zone thickness of the order of centimeters or less, the onset of thermally induced phenomena (e. g., frictional melting, thermal pressurization, etc.) may occur at any point along the rupture, depending on the degree of slip localization and rupture duration. In the absence of significant increases in the pore fluid pressure, localized fault slip may raise temperature by several hundred degrees, sufficient to cause melting. The onset of frictional melting may give rise to substantial increases in the effective fault strength due to an increase in the effective fault contact area, and high viscosity of silicate melts near solidus. The inferred transient increases in the dynamic friction ("viscous braking'') are consistent with results of high-speed rock sliding experiments and might explain field observations of the fault wall rip-out structures associated with pseudotachylites. Possible effects of viscous braking on the earthquake rupture dynamics include (1) delocalization of slip and increases in the effective fracture energy, (2) transition from a crack-like to a pulse-like rupture propagation, or (3) ultimate rupture arrest. Assuming that the pulse-like ruptures heal by <b>incipient</b> <b>fusion,</b> the seismologic observations can be used to place a lower bound on the dynamic fault friction. This bound is found to be of the order of several megapascals, essentially independent of the earthquake size. Further experimental and theoretical studies of melt rheology at high strain rates are needed to quantify the effects of melting on the dynamic fault strength...|$|E
40|$|Eggs of {{the purple}} sea-urchin, Strongylocentrotuspurpuratus, were fertilized and fixed with 2 % {{glutaraldehyde}} {{at various stages}} during cortical granule exocytosis. Fixation resulted in membrane blebs being formed precisely {{at the point of}} <b>incipient</b> granule <b>fusion.</b> These blebs pinched off to form the membranous vesicles frequently seen in exocytic pockets and in the perivitelline space. In contrast, eggs that were fixed with osmium tetroxide or were quick-frozen without chemical fixation, showed no signs of bleb or vesicle formation. Rather, fusion of each granule appeared to begin at a single minute pore, 30 - 50 nm in diameter, which then enlarged. We suggest that formation of blebs during glutaraldehyde fixation is an artifact that is caused by a highly localized and transient increase in membrane mobility. Normally, this increased mobility facilitates fusion of granule and plasma membranes, but in the presence of glutaraldehyde it leads to large-scale distortions of these fusing membranes...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} freeze-fracture {{appearance}} of membrane alterations accompanying {{the preparation of}} sperm membranes for fusions-the first preparatory stage occurring before physiological release of the acrosomal content, the second afterward-we induced the acrosome reaction in capacitated guinea pig spermatozoa by adding calcium to the mixture. The most common features observed before fusion of the acrosomal and plasma membranes were the deletion of fibrillar intramembranous particles from the E-fracture faces of both membranes, and the clearance of globular particles from the P face of the plasma membrane-events taking place near the terminus of the equatorial segment. Large particles, > 12 nm, remained {{not far from the}} cleared E-face patches. The P face of the outer acrosomal membrane is virtually clear from the outset. In addition, when fusion was completed, occasional double lines of large particles transiently embossed the P face of the plasma membrane (postacrosomal) side of the fusion zone. Behind the line of fusion, another series of particle-cleared foci emerged. We interpreted these postfusion membrane clearances as a second adaptation for sperm-egg interaction. Induction of the acrosome reaction in media containing phosphatidylcholine liposomes resulted in their apparent attachment, incorporation, or exchange in both the originally and secondarily cleared regions. Our observations support the concepts that membranes become receptive to union at particle- deficient interfaces, and that the physiologically created barren areas in freeze-fracture replicas may herald <b>incipient</b> membrane <b>fusion...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The work {{is aimed}} at {{conducting}} the study to obtain the results that will quantify the influence of contactor contact pressure in power circuits of electric stock on the highest current value Id, that does not cause plastic deformation of contacts; and on the current value Ifs– <b>incipient</b> <b>fusion</b> of contacts {{taking into account the}} operation conditions. Therefore, such a study targeted to establish the contact fusing causes is relevant. Methodology. The paper proposes an engineering method for determining the currents Id and Ifs, taking into account the value of contact pressure, electrodynamic forces of contact repulsion Fe. d. r, as well as the pressure influence on the values of such forces. Findings. Taking the contactors 1 SVAD 8 (locomotive ChS 8) and 7 SP 1 (locomotive ChS 4) as an example, the authors conducted the calculations and found that the peak pressure force increases the currents Id and Ifs for these contactors by 11. 8 %; 15. 5 %; 11. 8 %; and 15. 4 % respectively (compared with the specified currents at the minimum pressure force). Influenced by Fe. d. r the pressure force of contacts for 1 SVAD 8 contactor decreased by 13. 8 … 31. 8 %, and for 7 SP 1 contactor the value Fe. d. r may be greater than the pressure force. This can lead to spontaneous shutdown of the closed contactor that is not provided by the control circuit. Ensuring during operation the maximum allowable pressure force of the contacts Fc slightly affects the value Fe. d. r, compared with the case when Fc has the minimum permissible value (in event of a fault in the heating circuit Fe. d. r for contactors 1 SVAD 8 and 7 SP 1 is reduced by only 2. 45 % and 2. 59 % respectively). Originality. The authors for the first time presented a quantitative assessment of influence of contactor contact pressure in power circuits of electric stock on their plastic deformation and fusing using the proposed engineering method. Practical value. The results obtained during the research allow solving the problem for developing measures aimed to improve the reliability of the heating circuits of electric locomotives ChS 8 and ChS 4. The proposed method of determining Id and Ifs can be used to quantify the influence of pressure of the main electric contacts mounted in power circuits of electric stock of all series, if during the operation there are cases of plastic deformation, fusing, welding of such contacts, in order to improve the reliability of power circuits...|$|E
