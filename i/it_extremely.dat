5|$|The first comet whose orbit {{had been}} found to take <b>it</b> <b>extremely</b> close to the Sun was the Great Comet of 1680. This comet {{was found to have}} passed just 200,000km (0.0013AU) above the Sun's surface, {{equivalent}} to about half the distance between the Earth and the Moon. It thus became the first known sungrazing comet. Its perihelion distance was just 1.3 solar radii.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-14 is {{a binary}} star system, {{which means that}} it is {{actually}} composed of two gravitationally bound stars that orbit a common point in space. The system is composed of a primary star, Kepler-14A, and a dimmer companion star, Kepler-14B. When the stars were observed, while searching for the planet Kepler-14b, the angular separation of the binary system made <b>it</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult to note the dimmer companion star. The stars have such a wide orbit that it takes approximately 2800 years for each star to complete a revolution around the centroid. The two stars are located approximately 980 parsecs (3,196 light years) from Earth.|$|E

5|$|Poor {{organization}} {{among both}} North and South Korean units made <b>it</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult to estimate total casualties for both sides. Several units were completely {{destroyed in the}} fighting, making precise casualty counting difficult. A memo from the South Korean army claimed 3,800 North Korean killed and 181 captured in the P'ohang area from 17 August onward. However, casualty numbers are likely far higher. The NK 12th Division alone likely suffered at least 4,500 casualties {{on top of that}} number, reporting a strength of 6,000 on 5 August and only 1,500 on 17 August.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have found}} <b>it</b> <b>extremely</b> {{difficult}} to assign one specific, overarching theme to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters {{that human beings}} are neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are more or less alike, awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found {{it is clear that the}} play is full of several small, thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} and weight would have {{rendered}} the tank unable to cross bridges {{at the risk of}} collapsing them, and travelling on roads would soon destroy them. Though its top intended speed was 40kilometres per hour, its huge size and high visibility would have made <b>it</b> <b>extremely</b> vulnerable to aerial bombardment and artillery fire. Its great size would also have made it nearly impossible to transport—no existing railway or train car could bear its weight and its width was too great for existing tunnels.|$|E

5|$|By 1862, {{the second}} year of the Civil War, government-issued coinage began {{vanishing}} from circulation. American citizens hoarded all coins with gold and silver, and eventually began hoarding copper-nickel cents as well. This made <b>it</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult for businesses to conduct transactions. In response, many merchants turned to private minters to fill the void left by the hoarded coins. The first of these privately minted tokens appeared in the autumn of 1862, by H. A. Ratterman, in Cincinnati, Ohio. New York issues followed in the spring of 1863, first with Lindenmueller currency store card tokens issued by New York City barkeep Gustavus Lindenmueller and then with Knickerbocker currency patriotic tokens issued by William H. Bridgens. It is estimated that by 1864, there were 25,000,000 Civil War tokens (nearly all redeemable for one cent) in circulation, consisting of approximately 7,000–8,000 varieties.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is {{the tenth}} and last {{member of the}} 6d series and is the {{heaviest}} group 12 element in the periodic table, below zinc, cadmium and mercury. It is predicted to differ significantly from the lighter group12 elements. The valence s-subshells of the group 12 elements and period 7 elements {{are expected to be}} relativistically contracted most strongly at copernicium. This and the closed-shell configuration of copernicium result in it probably being a very noble metal. Its metallic bonds should also be very weak, possibly making <b>it</b> <b>extremely</b> volatile, like the noble gases, and potentially making it gaseous at room temperature. However, it should be able to form metal–metal bonds with copper, palladium, platinum, silver, and gold; these bonds are predicted to be only about 15–20kJ/mol weaker than the analogous bonds with mercury.|$|E
5|$|For example, of the 15 dolphin {{carcasses}} {{found in}} the Japurá River in 2010–2011 surveys, 73% of the dolphins were killed for bait, disposed of, or abandoned in entangled gillnets. The data does not fully represent the actual overall number of deaths of the Amazon river dolphins, whether accidental or intentional, because {{a variety of factors}} make <b>it</b> <b>extremely</b> complicated to record and medically examine all the carcasses. Scavenger species feed upon them and the complexity of the river currents makes it nearly impossible to locate all the carcasses. More importantly, the local fishermen do not report these deaths out of fear that legal action will be taken against them, as the Amazon river dolphin and other cetaceans are protected under the Brazilian federal law, prohibiting any takes, harassments, and kills of the species.|$|E

His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a working time schedule—from 08:00 until 18:00—making <b>it</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later he found employment more amenable to writing {{when he joined the}} Worker's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for personal injury to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace at this time owing to poor work safety policies at the time. It was especially true of factories fitted with machine lathes, drills, planing machines and rotary saws which were rarely fitted with safety guards.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{analyses}} of the composition of durian aroma found numerous volatile compounds including esters, ketones, and different sulphur compounds, with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour. People in South East Asia with frequent exposures to durian are able to easily distinguish its sweet-like ketones and esters scent from rotten or putrescine odours which are from volatile amines and fatty acids. Developmental or genetic differences in olfactory perception and mapping within the brain (for e.g. anterior piriform cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex) could possibly explain why some individuals are unable to differentiate these smells and find this fruit noxious whereas others find <b>it</b> <b>extremely</b> pleasant and appealing.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Heavy Draft was {{originally}} bred to be a versatile horse used in agriculture, urban settings, and military capacities, {{as well as}} for the production of large mules for the military. The breed's docility, size, strength, and speed made <b>it</b> <b>extremely</b> useful for Italian farmers before the introduction of mechanization. It is still used for farming in a few areas where mechanization is impractical. The mares are also still used for the production of mules, although most horses today are bred for meat. Italy is one of the top global consumers of horse meat; consumption jumped by 31 percent between 2001 and 2006. Eleven- to eighteen-month-old foals are preferred for slaughter.|$|E

5|$|The forward {{troops of}} the German and Ottoman rearguard, which held a front of about , were driven back to Bir el Abd by the New Zealanders. At this time, the attackers {{appeared}} likely to succeed, as they had firmly established themselves across the telegraph line and the old caravan road, supported by the Somerset and Leicester batteries. But the German, Austrian and Ottoman rearguard quickly realised how thin the attacking line was, and at 09:00 advanced out of their trenches to counterattack. This aggressive move was only checked by artillery fire from the Somerset Battery effectively combined with fire from machine guns. The subsequent fire fight made <b>it</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult for the mounted riflemen to maintain their position, and on the flanks the light horse were also held up. The German and Ottoman infantry renewed their attack towards {{a gap between the}} New Zealanders and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, but the 5th Light Horse Regiment covered the gap, and the German and Ottoman advance was halted.|$|E

The Smithsonian American Art Museum currently lists 159 locations. Of that number, 134 currently existing originals have been independently authenticated, and several have been identified as copies by other artists (notably Over the Top by John Paulding). Viquesney's actual brochures quoted a figure of over 300 by the late 1930s, claiming at least one in every state of the Union, but this is believed to be an inflated figure.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in November 1945, Cariappa {{was made}} the {{commander}} of the Bannu Frontier Brigade in Waziristan. It was during this time that Colonel Ayub Khan – later Field Marshal and President of Pakistan (1962–1969) – served under him. Unlike previous British commanders who tried to keep the local tribes under control by force, Cariappa tried a different approach by extending them friendly relations which worked well. When Head of the Interim Government, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited Bannu he found <b>it</b> <b>extremely</b> peaceful and settled, compared to Razmak where another brigade was stationed. Nehru was impressed by Cariappa's way of dealing with the tribes. He was also widely acclaimed for his treatment of the Indian National Army's (INA) prisoners. When Cariappa visited one of the camps that held INA prisoners, he was moved by the conditions in which they lived. He immediately wrote to the Adjutant General recommending that their living conditions be improved and to pardon some of those who were not guilty. These included Colonel Prem Kumar Sahgal, Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan. Cariappa pointed out that these prisoners had considerable support from the Indian leaders, who would later rule the country. This led the British to release most of the prisoners.|$|E
