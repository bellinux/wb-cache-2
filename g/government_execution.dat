50|$|Capital {{punishment}} {{is a legal}} and often-used form of punishment in North Korea for many offences, such as grand theft, murder, rape, drug smuggling, treason, espionage, political dissidence, defection, piracy, consumption of media not approved {{by the government and}} proselytizing religious beliefs that contradict practiced Juche ideology. Current working knowledge of the topic depends heavily on the accounts of defectors (both relatives of victims, and former members of the <b>government).</b> <b>Executions</b> are mostly carried out by firing squad, hanging or decapitation in public, making North Korea one of the last six countries to still perform public executions, the other five being Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen.|$|R

Neumann, Director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence at King's College London, viral {{beheading}} videos are intended, and are {{at least}} somewhat effective, as a recruiting tool for jihad among both Western and Middle Eastern youth. [...] Other observers argue that while Al Qaeda initially used beheading as a publicity tool, it later decided that they caused Muslims to recoil from Islamism and that although ISIS/IS is enthusiastically deploying beheading as a tactic in 2014, it, too, may find that the tactic backfires.

5000|$|The Federal Government's {{authority}} {{to enter into}} contracts derives from the U.S. Constitution, which defines its powers. The Federal Government acts through legislation, treaties, implementing regulations, and the exercise of those authorities. The Federal Government's power to contract is not set forth expressly and specifically in the U.S. Constitution. However, the U.S. Constitution appears to assume the continued vitality [...] "Engagements" [...] entered into under the Articles of Confederation. U.S. Const., Art. VI. Moreover, the power to contract was and is regarded at law as necessarily incidental to the Federal <b>Government's</b> <b>execution</b> of its other powers. An early Supreme Court case, United States v. Thomas Tingey, 30 U.S. 5 Pet. 115 (1831), recognized that the United States Government {{has a right to}} enter into a contract. It is an incident to the general right of sovereignty, and the United States, may, within the sphere of the constitutional powers confided to it and through the instrumentality of the proper department to which those powers are confided, enter into contracts not prohibited by law and appropriate to the just exercise of those powers. Scores of statutes now also expressly authorize departments and agencies to enter into contracts. The U.S. Congress passes legislation that defines the process and additional legislation that provides the funds. Executive branch agencies enter into the contracts and expend the funds to achieve their Congressionally defined missions. When disputes arise, administrative processes within the agencies may resolve them, or the contractor can appeal to the courts.|$|R

40|$|The essay’s {{main focus}} has been to {{investigate}} and analyze the political actions behind the 2015 ’s grade compromise; an agreement to introduce grades from the fourth year in primary school. Through a game-theory analysis, mainly based in Leif Lewin’s and Jörgen Herman's research on rationality in politics, {{this study examined the}} grade debate  during a fifteen year period. The primary task has thereby been to explain the grade compromise through game-theory. According to the study carried out it is possible to conclude that the conservative parties mainly used strategies as smart rhetorical actions and condemnation of the socialist school policies in order to achieve their goals. They also strategically tried to persuade the opposition to favor their policy. Finally, by postponing the decision process, concerning the grades from grade six, they could promote the election campaign in 2010 and maintain high influence in the government. The red and green parties had for a long time been having differing opinions regarding school policies and education, however, they started cooperating in order to promote their respective preferences. The strategies used were mainly small deviations from their own opinions to make the various outcomes more advantageous. After defeat they strategically embraced the new policy and made it their own to stay strong. The conservative alliance saw the compromise as a strategic way to implement their own policy without relying on the red/green <b>governments</b> <b>execution.</b> The red and green parties also benefited from the compromise. They did not have to discard and abandon their preferences, instead they could prevent the proposal from becoming another legislative change...|$|R
