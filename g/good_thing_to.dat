[...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide", the season's nineteenth episode, was the first of the series to contain sequences of animation. While previous guest actor Leonard Nimoy had retired, the writers still had storylines involving his character, William Bell. They were able to record his voice, and consequently worked with Zoic Studios to develop the episode. This unorthodox storytelling device was consistent with the nineteenth episodes of other seasons, including [...] "Brown Betty" [...] and [...] "Letters of Transit".|$|E

[...] the episode featured comments from Oberman, Grantham (Den), Dean (Sharon), Medcalf (Sam), Beckett (Jake), and Windsor (Peggy) profiling Chrissie and exploring the nuanced nature of the character.

But soap and film noir {{have a lot in common}} – the bad girls have to be punished." [...] However, critics considered Chrissie to be a [...] "three-dimensional soap bitch", rather than a flat pantomime figure. Despite having killed her father, Chrissie highly valued her friendship with Sharon, declaring at one point: [...] "my friendship with you is the only <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> come out of my relationship with Den, and I mean that!" [...] Oberman characterised Chrissie as [...] "part victim part villain", declaring [...] "I think of her as a villain with a heart". She felt that, although [...] "no excuse" [...] for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did: [...] "She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique", and that [...] "these characters are made, not born." [...] Chrissie was haunted by the alcoholic fate of Den's first wife, which she vowed at Angie's grave to avoid. But in spite of her efforts, and indeed because of them, she failed, as she came to recognise: [...] "You know it's funny; when Den used to talk about Ange he used to describe her as this weak sad, cow.
