5|$|All modern scleractinian skeletons are {{composed}} of calcium carbonate {{in the form of}} crystals of aragonite, however, a prehistoric scleractinian (Coelosimilia) had a non-aragonite skeletal structure which was composed of calcite. The structure of both simple and compound scleractinians <b>is</b> <b>light</b> and porous, rather than solid {{as is the case in}} the prehistoric order Rugosa. Scleractinians are also distinguished from rugosans by their pattern of septal insertion.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} sales volume, most of today's beer {{is based on}} the pale lager brewed in 1842 in the town of Pilsen in the present-day Czech Republic. The modern pale lager <b>is</b> <b>light</b> in colour with a {{noticeable}} carbonation (fizzy bubbles) and a typical alcohol by volume content of around 5%. The Pilsner Urquell, Bitburger, and Heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager, as are the American brands Budweiser, Coors, and Miller.|$|E
5|$|In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, {{northwest}} winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, {{the region}} is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation <b>is</b> <b>light,</b> though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.|$|E
5|$|The first Prophet in {{the mythology}} of Carnivàle is the Alpha. This {{creature}} is never mentioned in the series, but Knauf described her as a female who lived before the Flood and whose story was lost with {{the destruction of the}} Royal Library of Alexandria. The Alpha spawned the first pair of Avatara, manifestations of some higher power or House; one <b>is</b> <b>Light</b> and the other Dark. A Creature of Light and a Creature of Darkness have been born to each generation since, and unlike the Alpha, they have always been male.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 13 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> grey overlaid with white. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 16-18 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> pinkish-ochreous-grey {{with the}} costa obscurely suffused yellow-whitish. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> grey.|$|R

5|$|The fish's {{upper surface}} is brown to reddish brown with many {{scattered}} darker spots, lighter streaks, and reticulations. The {{center of each}} pectoral fin is marked with an oval spot or blotch. The lower surface <b>is</b> <b>light,</b> white to grey, blotched irregularly with gray spots. The barndoor skate is unique from other species of skate in its having a straight line that begins at the snout and ends at the anterior margin of the outer corner of the disk, but stopping short of the disk.|$|E
5|$|All of the fins, {{particularly}} the narrow pectoral fins, are falcate (sickle-shaped) to some degree. The medium-sized first dorsal fin originates {{just behind the}} pectoral fin rear tips. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds as tall as the first, {{and there is no}} midline ridge running between them. The pelvic fins are broad and slightly larger than the anal fin. The anal fin has a strong notch in the trailing margin and is positioned slightly behind the second dorsal fin. The caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the upper origin of the caudal fin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The prominent lateral line curves downward below the second dorsal fin. The skin is densely covered by small, overlapping dermal denticles; each bears five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species <b>is</b> <b>light</b> grey to bronze above, darkening at the tips of the second dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe (though this may be indistinct in larger sharks), and pale below. The underside is off-white, and the first dorsal fin has a pale trailing margin.|$|E
5|$|If one interprets each 1-cell in Rule 184 as {{containing}} a particle, these particles behave {{in many ways}} similarly to automobiles in a single lane of traffic: they move forward at a constant speed if there is open space in front of them, and otherwise they stop. Traffic models such as Rule 184 and its generalizations that discretize both space and time are commonly called particle-hopping models. Although very primitive, the Rule 184 model of traffic flow already predicts some of the familiar emergent features of real traffic: clusters of freely moving cars separated by stretches of open road when traffic <b>is</b> <b>light,</b> and waves of stop-and-go traffic when it is heavy.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 29 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> drab, suffused with light greyish olive. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> cinnamon drab.|$|R

5|$|Narcissus {{plants have}} one to several basal leaves which are linear, ligulate or strap shaped (long and narrow), {{sometimes}} channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) {{or may not}} (sessile) have a petiole stalk. The leaves are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour <b>is</b> <b>light</b> green to blue-green. In the mature plant the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species the leaves are low hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath. After flowering the leaves turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.|$|E
5|$|Precipitation falls {{throughout}} the year but <b>is</b> <b>light</b> overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas. Munster, in the south, records the least snow whereas Ulster, in the north, records the most.|$|E
5|$|The Avataric Blood travels within {{families}} {{forming a}} dynasty. The first-born {{son of an}} Avatar receives a so-called mantle at birth that manifests him as an Avatar of a new generation; whether the new Avatar <b>is</b> <b>Light</b> or Dark is chance. Therefore, there is one Avatar to each House per generation. Giving birth to a new Avatar leaves the mother barren and insane. Before that time, she can give birth to an unlimited number of females from an Avatar. These {{children as well as}} their respective offspring are called Vectori, beings with Avataric Blood who are not themselves Avatara, and who thus become generationally further removed from an Avatar in the bloodline. While Vectori cannot become Avatara, as that mantle is only conveyed upon birth, they can still exhibit some minor powers and often show signs of insanity.|$|E
50|$|The {{historic}} Stone Bridge, {{which has}} <b>been</b> <b>lighted</b> in colorful, programmable LED <b>lights,</b> <b>is</b> located {{at one end}} of the park. Every evening the bridge <b>is</b> <b>lighted</b> for three hours, beginning with a 20-minute lightshow before settling into a static scheme chosen to reflect the time of year, holidays, or special events and observances. The bridge will <b>be</b> <b>lighted</b> during festival hours, starting at dusk.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 6.5-8 mm for males. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> brownish grey, sprinkled with dark brown. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> silvery greyish brown.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 12-13 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> saffron {{without any}} markings, {{but with the}} edges and apical part slightly darker. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> yellow.|$|R
5|$|The {{breeding}} male {{is bright}} russet or cinnamon red on its upperparts from its crown to its rump, {{with a black}} streaking on its mantle. It has a small black bib and black around its eye, separated from the russet of its crown by a very thin white supercilium, a stripe running from the bill {{to the rear of}} the head. The side of its neck and cheek are off-white, and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow, varying geographically. Shoulders and greater coverts are chestnut, and its median coverts are black at the base with white at the tips. The rest of the wing <b>is</b> <b>light</b> brown with black tinges. Its tail is blackish brown, edged with ashy brown. The non-breeding male differs little from the breeding male, being paler with more orange upperparts. The only species with which the male is easily confused is the Eurasian tree sparrow, which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back.|$|E
5|$|The {{color and}} texture of the coyote's fur varies {{somewhat}} geographically. The hair's predominant color <b>is</b> <b>light</b> gray and red or fulvous, interspersed around the body with black and white. Coyotes living at high elevations {{tend to have more}} black and gray shades than their desert-dwelling counterparts, which are more fulvous or whitish-gray. The coyote's fur consists of short, soft underfur and long, coarse guard hairs. The fur of northern subspecies is longer and denser than in southern forms, with the fur of some Mexican and Central American forms being almost hispid (bristly). Generally, adult coyotes (including coywolf hybrids) have a sable coat color, dark neonatal coat color, bushy tail with an active supracaudal gland, and a white facial mask. Albinism is extremely rare in coyotes; {{out of a total of}} 750,000 coyotes harvested by federal and cooperative hunters between March22, 1938, and June30, 1945, only two were albinos.|$|E
5|$|The fins are {{strongly}} falcate (sickle-shaped), particularly the dorsal fins, pelvic fins, and lower caudal fin lobe. The pectoral fins are narrow and pointed. The first dorsal fin is positioned about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds as tall as the first and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal fin. The anal fin is smaller than the second dorsal fin. The dorsal surface of the caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping; each has five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species <b>is</b> <b>light</b> grey or bronze above, often with small white spots on the sides, and pale below. The dorsal fins are tipped in white, which is especially obvious on the second dorsal as the remainder of fin is mostly dark.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 4-5 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> brownish with brown groups of scales are blackish flecks arranged longitudinally. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>light</b> graphite grey.|$|R

5|$|The muzzle is {{narrow and}} long. The lower eyelid {{contains}} a large, transparent disk. The head is olive-brown. There are black scales {{with a white}} border between the eyes and the ears. The body is somewhat darker than the head and covered with irregular black and white spots above and is bluish white below. The limbs are yellowish white below. The tail <b>is</b> <b>light</b> brown above, but has two rows of darker spots, and yellowish white below. Snout-to-vent length is 83mm (3.3in), head length 10mm (0.39in), head width 6.5mm (0.26in), length of the body 33mm (1.3in), length of the forelimb 15mm (0.59in), length of the hindlimb 23mm (0.91in), and length of the (incomplete) tail 40mm (1.6in).|$|E
5|$|To {{serve in}} the Maryland Senate, a person must be a citizen of Maryland 25 {{years of age or}} older. Elections for the 47 Senate seats are held every four years {{coincident}} with the federal election in which the President of the United States is not elected. Vacancies are filled through appointment by the Governor. The Senate meets for three months every year; {{the rest of the year}} the work of the Senate <b>is</b> <b>light</b> and most members hold another job during this time. It has been controlled by Democrats for a number of years. In the 2006 election, more than two-thirds of the Senate seats were won by Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms <b>is</b> <b>light</b> and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E
