5|$|During his labors {{to sustain}} the {{provisional}} government, Johnson's lack of hearing from his family weighed heavily upon him. The only family member {{with whom he had}} contact was his son Madison ("Matty"), who had joined John Hunt Morgan's cavalry. Johnson admired and respected Morgan, and was pleased that his son <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> serve under him. In 1862, he requested by letter that his wife send their fifteen-year-old son Junius to serve in the Confederate Army. Despite Johnson's protestations that he would ensure his son's safety, his wife refused this request.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} also the first in which Freema Agyeman appears, {{although}} she is not {{playing the role of}} Martha Jones, which she would play in series 3, but a minor character named Adeola (who is later revealed to be Martha's cousin). Russell T Davies admired Agyeman's performance as Adeola and called her back to fill the role of companion that Piper <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> leave.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{start date}} was mid-1999, {{with the release}} date set for Christmas 2000, but Fox moved X-Men to June. Steven Spielberg {{had been scheduled to}} film Minority Report for release in June 2000, but he <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> film A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and Fox needed a film to fill the void. This meant that Singer had to finish X-Men six months ahead of schedule, although filming had been pushed back. The release date was then moved to July 14.|$|E

5|$|After Metternich's {{studies in}} Vienna, the Prince's death in September 1797 allowed Metternich to {{participate}} in the Congress of Rastatt. Initially his father took him as a secretary while ensuring that, when proceedings officially started in December 1797, he was named the representative of the Catholic Bench of the College of the Counts of Westphalia. A bored Metternich remained at Rastatt in this role until 1799 when the congress was finally wound down. During this period Eleonore <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> live with Metternich at Rastatt and gave birth to sons Francis (February 1798) and, shortly {{after the end of the}} Congress, Klemens (June 1799). Much to Metternich's anguish Klemens died after only a few days, and Francis soon contracted a lung infection from which he would never recover.|$|E
5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E
5|$|In late 1863, the New Zealand {{government}} requested {{troops to}} assist in the invasion of the Waikato province against the Māori. Promised settlement on confiscated land, more than 2,500 Australians (over half of whom were from Victoria) were recruited to form four Waikato Regiments. Other Australians became scouts in the Company of Forest Rangers. Despite experiencing arduous conditions the Australians were not heavily involved in battle, and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties. Australians were involved in actions at Matarikoriko, Pukekohe East, Titi Hill, Ōrākau and Te Ranga. Fewer than 20 were believed to have been killed in action. The conflict was over by 1864, and the Waikato Regiments disbanded in 1867. However, many of the soldiers who <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities {{by the end of the}} decade, while many others had returned to Australia.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, many {{academics}} left the University of California, lured away by higher-salary offers {{and by the}} University's peculiar loyalty oath requirement. Segrè chose to take the oath and stay, but this did not allay suspicions about his loyalty. Luis Alvarez was incensed that Amaldi, Fermi, Pontecorvo, Rasetti and Segrè <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> pursue patent claims against the United States for their pre-war discoveries and told Segrè {{to let him know}} when Pontecorvo wrote from Russia. He also clashed with Lawrence over the latter's plan to create a rival nuclear-weapons laboratory to Los Alamos in Livermore, California, in order to develop the hydrogen bomb, a weapon that Segrè felt would be of dubious utility.|$|E
5|$|Of the 56 players {{first-round draft}} picks, 30 have been pitchers, {{the most of}} any position; 20 of these were right-handed, while 10 were left-handed. Twelve outfielders were {{selected}}, and eight shortstops, three catchers, and two third basemen were taken. The team also selected one player at first base, but has never drafted a second baseman. Fifteen of the players came from institutions in the state of California, while Florida and Texas follow with seven players each. The Royals have drafted two players, Luke Hochevar (2006) and Aaron Crow (2009), who were playing in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball {{at the time of their}} draft. Both had been drafted previously by other major league teams but <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> play for the Fort Worth Cats instead. They have also drafted one player from Puerto Rico: Juan Lebron (1995).|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 1864, the 22nd {{was pulled}} from the {{trenches}} and posted on guard duty at City Point, Virginia, the main supply depot of the Union army. Maj. Gen. Meade had specifically requested a depleted unit whose term of service was nearly up for this duty. They remained there until October 3, their three years of service having expired. Those of the regiment who <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> re-enlist, along with the remaining draftees who had joined the unit in 1863, were consolidated with the 32nd Massachusetts. The remaining men of the 22nd who had served their three years and {{did not wish to}} re-enlist, 125 in number, returned to Boston by railroad, arriving on October 10. After ceremonies in Boston, the regiment was officially mustered out on October 17, 1864.|$|E

5|$|Siwiec's timing {{has been}} {{described}} as unfortunate, as he chose to commit his act during a dance (mazurka), at which time his cry was muffled due to the sounds of an orchestra playing. Some, like Tomas Kavaliauskas or Krzysztof Kąkolewski, have speculated that if he <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> act moments earlier, during a speech by Polish communist leader Władysław Gomułka, first secretary of the Polish United Workers Party, the commotion he caused would have likely interrupted it and his message might have been witnessed more widely. Publicist Antoni Zambrowski noted that many other self-immolators like Czech Jan Palach had cooperated with anti-communist opposition movements and left messages and other documents which helped publicize their activities; Siwiec worked alone and so the Polish anti-communist opposition with which he identified with was not aware of his action and the meaning behind it until much later.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather in}} the area had wind up towards , with clouds and heavy rain, and some reports of turbulence. The {{aircraft}} was not equipped with ground proximity warning system, nor was this required. There was no requirement for the aircraft to have a flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), but the airline <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> install the latter. Interviews with the surviving passengers showed {{that none of them}} perceived that there was any problems with the flight until the sudden impact. One of the passengers was a navigation professional and could see parts of the cockpit from his seat; he was thus able to confirm some of the navigational display readings. Interviews with locals indicated that the aircraft followed a normal path.|$|E
5|$|When The Jackson 5 parted {{with their}} record label Motown in 1976, they signed to CBS Records and rebranded {{themselves}} as The Jacksons. Additionally, the brothers were signed to CBS-TV to star {{with their family}} in a variety series called The Jacksons. The shows premiered in June 1976 and featured all of the siblings excluding Jermaine, who <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> stay with Motown. The initial series run of the 30-minute programs was four weeks. Due to ratings success, more episodes were ordered in January 1977. The shows {{marked the first time}} that an African-American family had ever starred in a television series. The run of programs concluded shortly afterward.|$|E

5|$|With the {{delivery}} of Class 93, NSB started to retire or sell the Di 3. In November 2001, five units were sold for NOK 250,000 each—well under market price—to the new private operator Ofotbanen. The purchase raised controversy, because the potential operator Banetransport had offered full market price for the trains. One year after delivery, six of eleven Class 93-locomotives were out of order. To solve the problem, NSB had to rent back used Di 3 locomotives from Ofotbanen. NSB <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> sell the old locomotives for less than market price, but Ofotbanen demanded that NSB pay the entire purchase price for the short-term rental back.|$|E
5|$|Although born in Canada, Stastny is a dual {{citizen of}} Canada and the United States. Both {{he and his}} brother Yan have chosen to play internationally for the United States. Among the reasons that led him to choose to play for the United States was the {{possibility}} to play in an international competition with his brother, who <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> play for the United States before Paul. Paul represented the U.S. {{for the first time in}} the 2004 Viking Cup, where he won a silver medal playing for the junior team. According to Hockey's Future, he was one of the most important American talents in the tournament. Stastny played internationally for the United States national ice hockey team for the first time in the 2007 IIHF World Championship. He played seven games, scored four goals and four assists, had two penalty minutes and finished even in plus/minus. The United States lost in the quarterfinals against Finland. Stastny was named the best American player in the 3–0 win against Germany, when he scored two goals and had one assist. He was chosen as one of the three best United States players at the tournament, together with Lee Stempniak and Toby Petersen.|$|E
5|$|Juan José Arévalo Bermejo {{was born}} into a middle-class family in 1904. He became a primary school teacher for a brief while, and then earned a {{scholarship}} to a university in Argentina, where he earned a doctorate in the philosophy of education. He returned to Guatemala in 1934, and sought a position in the Ministry of Education. However, he was denied the position he wished for, and felt uncomfortable under the dictatorship of Ubico. He left the country and held a faculty position in Argentina until 1944, when he returned to Guatemala. In July 1944 the Renovación Nacional, the teachers' party, had been formed, and Arévalo was named its candidate. In an unexpected surge of support, his candidacy was endorsed by many of the leading organizations among the protesters, including the student federation. His lack of connection to the dictatorship and his academic background both worked in his favor among the students and teachers. At the same time, the fact that he <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> go into exile in conservative Argentina rather than revolutionary Mexico reassured landowners worried about socialist or communist reform.|$|E

5|$|Paine left England {{before he}} could be tried, {{as he had been}} elected a member of the National Convention in France, tasked with writing a new constitution. He {{departed}} England on 13 September, never to return, although he further infuriated the government remotely by republishing the Rights of Man and writing Letter Addressed to the Addressors of the Late Proclamation, in which he defended his actions and beliefs against those who <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> side with the government. Paine was instead represented in absentia by Thomas Erskine, a famous lawyer and orator who served as Attorney General to the Prince of Wales. As the trial date approached, both Erskine and Paine were targeted by vicious personal attacks. Paine's writ was followed by hundreds of loyal addresses, many of which targeted him, the burning of an effigy in Exeter, and the banning of the sale of any of his books in Chester. Pamphlets slandering him were widely published, and both Paine and Erskine had their personal lives dug into.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{to regain}} for himself the kingdom lost by his {{half-brother}} Olaf Haraldsson, Harald began his journey westwards in early 1045, departing from Novgorod (Holmgard) to Staraya Ladoga (Aldeigjuborg) where he obtained a ship. His journey went through Lake Ladoga, down the Neva River, {{and then into}} the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea. He arrived in Sigtuna in Sweden, probably at the end of 1045 or in early 1046. When he arrived in Sweden, according to the skald Tjodolv Arnorsson, his ship was unbalanced by its heavy load of gold. In Harald's absence, the throne of Norway had been restored to Magnus the Good, an illegitimate son of Olaf. Harald may actually have known this, and {{it could have been the}} reason why Harald wanted to return to Norway in the first place. Since Cnut the Great's sons <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> abandon Norway and instead fight over England, and his sons and successors Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut had died young, Magnus's position as king had been secured. No domestic threats or insurrections are recorded to have occurred during his eleven-year reign. After the death of Harthacnut, which had left the Danish throne vacant, Magnus had in addition been selected to be the king of Denmark, and managed to defeat the Danish royal pretender Sweyn Estridsson.|$|E
5|$|Several small clashes were fought between Allied and Japanese forces during February. The Fijian {{force at}} Ibu was {{reinforced}} to a strength of about 400 personnel on 3February, but was withdrawn to the perimeter {{in the middle}} of the month after a larger body of Japanese troops surrounded the outpost and began to attack the US Army units which were protecting its supply lines. All of the Fijian troops, along with 200 civilians who <b>had</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> evacuate with the battalion, reached the coast on 19February. Other American patrols and positions to the north and north-east of the perimeter were also attacked, and the Allies concluded that the Japanese force was being concentrated in this area. Papers taken from the bodies of Japanese soldiers killed in this fighting also allowed the Allies to build up an accurate appreciation of the Japanese plan of attack as well as the order of battle of the forces involved. Intelligence information detailing the Japanese plans was then distributed to American soldiers holding the perimeter through various means, including notices posted on unit bulletin boards.|$|E
