5|$|Spokane and its {{metro area}} in general, {{particularly}} northern Idaho has been stigmatized {{in the popular}} consciousness {{by a number of}} <b>hate</b> <b>groups</b> that have been set up in and around Coeur d'Alene, Idaho in the past. Low ethnic diversity made the region a destination for some seeking to escape more cosmopolitan cities for a locale with a relatively homogenous, white population. This trend increased with the arrival of retired engineer Richard Butler from California who traveled to Hayden, Idaho in 1974 to eventually establish a white supremacist church called the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, better known by its political arm, the Aryan Nations. Aryan Nations recruits and associates were responsible for several hate crimes and terror plots during the mid 1980s and 1990s. The group went defunct in 2000 when the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a civil suit which resulted in a $6.3 million settlement, which led to the eventual bankruptcy and closure of their Hayden compound. Another significant act of hate was the attempted bombing of Spokane's Martin Luther King Day Parade by Kevin Harpham of Addy, Washington in 2011. The Southern Poverty Law Center currently lists three <b>hate</b> <b>groups</b> in the Spokane and Coeur d'Alene metro areas, in the categories of anti-Muslim, Holocaust denial, and general hate.|$|E

25|$|Since 2001, the SPLC has {{released}} an annual {{issue of the}} Intelligence Project called Year in Hate, later renamed Year in Hate and Extremism, in which they present statistics on the numbers of <b>hate</b> <b>groups</b> in America. The current format of the report covers racial <b>hate</b> <b>groups,</b> nativist <b>hate</b> <b>groups,</b> and other right-wing extremist groups such as groups within the Patriot Movement. Jesse Walker, writing in Reason.com, criticized the 2016 report, questioning whether the count was reliable, as it focused {{on the number of}} groups rather than {{the number of people in}} those groups or the size of the groups. Walker gives the example that the 2016 report itself concedes an increase in the number of KKK groups could be due to two large groups falling apart, leading to members creating smaller local groups.|$|E

25|$|The Klan has {{expanded}} its recruitment efforts to white supremacists at the international level. For some time, the Klan's numbers have been steadily dropping.

25|$|Many modern Christians {{are united}} in the {{condemnation}} of slavery as wrong {{and contrary to}} God's will. Only peripheral {{groups such as the}} Ku Klux Klan and other Christian <b>hate</b> <b>groups</b> on the racist fringes of the Christian Reconstructionist and Christian Identity movements advocate the reinstitution of slavery. Full adherents to reconstructionism are few and marginalized among conservative Christians. With these exceptions, all Christian faith groups now condemn slavery, and see the practice as incompatible with basic Christian principles.|$|E
25|$|The SPLC's {{identification}} and listings of <b>hate</b> <b>groups</b> and extremists {{has been the}} subject of controversy. Critics of the SPLC say that it chooses its causes with funding and donations in mind, and argue that people and groups designated as 'hate groups' are often targeted by protests that prevent them from speaking. The SPLC sometimes responds by reviewing its actions and removing people or organizations from hate listings, such as that of Ben Carson; however, it has stood behind the vast majority of its listings.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, the SPLC began a {{litigation}} {{strategy of}} filing civil suits for monetary damages {{on behalf of}} the victims of violence from the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups, with all damages recovered given to the victims or donated to other organizations. The SPLC also became involved in other civil rights causes, including cases to challenge what it sees as institutional racial segregation and discrimination, inhumane and unconstitutional conditions in prisons and detention centers, discrimination based on sexual orientation, mistreatment of illegal immigrants, and the unconstitutional mixing of church and state. The SPLC has provided information about <b>hate</b> <b>groups</b> to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other law enforcement agencies.|$|E

25|$|In 1987, SPLC won a {{case against}} the United Klans of America for the lynching of Michael Donald, a black {{teenager}} in Mobile, Alabama. The SPLC used an unprecedented legal strategy of holding an organization responsible for the crimes of individual members to help produce a $7million judgement for the victim's mother. The verdict forced United Klans of America into bankruptcy. Its national headquarters was sold for approximately $52,000 to help satisfy the judgement. In 1987, five members of a Klan offshoot, the White Patriot Party, were indicted for stealing military weaponry and plotting to kill Dees. The SPLC has since successfully used this precedent to force numerous Ku Klux Klan and other <b>hate</b> <b>groups</b> into bankruptcy.|$|E

Less than two weeks later, Babeu's spokesman issued an apology, {{saying that he had}} not researched the show thoroughly enough before scheduling the interview and that Babeu has a policy of not conducting interviews with <b>hate</b> <b>groups.</b> Babeu himself said that he was [...] "hoodwinked" [...] into appearing on the show and that he rejects [...] "any hate or bigotry". Prior to the interview, cohost Eddie Miller said that [...] "Of all the people we‚Äôve interviewed on this radio show, I would say the only people that came close to getting me this excited was Dr. David Duke." [...] Following Babeu's spokesman's apology, Edwards alleged that Babeu was aware of the show's true ideology prior to appearing on the show, saying: [...] "For Sheriff Babeu to change his mind and now regret coming on our show, for whatever reason, is his right. For him to act as though he had no idea of our ideology is a lie." [...] As a result of the controversy surrounding Babeu's appearance on the show, Arizona U.S. Senate candidate J. D. Hayworth asked his primary opponent, John McCain, to drop several campaign ads featuring McCain and Babeu. In 2011, another sheriff, Dennis Spruell of Montezuma County, Colorado, also apologized after appearing on the show without knowing its actual agenda.|$|E
