500|$|The {{problem of}} declining {{revenues}} {{was not limited}} to the CLR; all of London's tube lines and the sub-surface DR and MR were affected by competition to some degree. The reduced income from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the companies to pay back borrowed capital, or to pay dividends to shareholders. The CLR's dividend payments fell to 3per cent from 1905, but those of the UERL's lines were as low as 0.75per cent. From 1907, the CLR, the UERL, the C, and the Great Northern & City Railway companies began to introduce <b>fare</b> <b>agreements.</b> From 1908, they began to present themselves through common branding as the Underground. In November 1912, after secret take-over talks, the UERL announced that it was purchasing the CLR, swapping one of its own shares for each of the CLR's.

50|$|There {{were now}} three {{competing}} routes to Reading: the GWR from Paddington at 36 miles; the LSWR from Waterloo at 43.5 miles and the SER from Charing Cross at 69 miles. Despite the disparity, the GWR {{was not the}} obvious choice due to relative position of Paddington station, west of the City of London. This allowed intense competition between the three companies until in 1858 a new agreement between the three companies was made to fix prices and share <b>fares.</b> The <b>agreement</b> led to a connecting spur between the SER and GWR railways in Reading being opened for goods traffic on 1 December 1858 and to passenger traffic on 17 January 1859. A better placed link was opened on 17 December 1899, and a third link on 1 June 1941. The link is today used by special services such as luxury steam services.|$|R
5000|$|The fare {{structure}} differs between Metro Silver Line, Metro Express, Foothill Transit's Silver Streak, Foothill Transit Line 481, and Foothill Transit's Commuter Express. Fares vary {{based on the}} destination. Metro Silver Line charges $2.45 on the busway regardless of the trip length. For Metro Express Lines: 485, 487 & 489 the base fare of $1.75 is applied for passengers not traveling east of Cal State L.A. Station. Before the Metro Silver Line was implemented, former Metro Express Lines: 483, 484, and 490 charged $1.25 for the base fare for passengers not traveling east of the Cal State LA Station. Since {{the opening of the}} Metro Silver Line, Metro has been working with Foothill Transit to have each agency's pass accepted on the Metro Silver Line and Foothill Transit's Silver Streak. On October 2012, an agreement was reached with Foothill Transit to lower the Silver Streak's base fare from $2.50 to $2.45 and accept Metro's passes. Metro would begin accepting Foothill Transit's passes for the Metro Silver Line. As a result of the Foothill Transit-Metro [...] "Silver2Silver" [...] program, the Silver Streak also charges a $2.45 fare for all trips. The fare for Line 481 is $2.75, regardless of trip length. Commuter Express fares are $4.90. Metro and Foothill Transit's [...] "Silver2Silver" [...] program is only applied between the El Monte Station and Downtown Los Angeles. This is the only segment where both the Metro Silver Line and Foothill's Silver Streak run together. To make up Foothill Transit's loss of lowering the Silver Streak fare, Metro will pay Foothill Transit from subsidies coming from the Metro Express Lanes project. The year-long promotion will run through October 2013. During the time in between Metro and Foothill Transit will determine if the program is successful. If the program is deemed successful, the agreement will become permanent. This may cause Metro to consider doing a <b>fare</b> <b>agreement</b> on the Harbor busway with Torrance Transit, and Gardena Transit.|$|E

2500|$|Through formal <b>fare</b> {{reciprocity}} <b>agreements,</b> MARTA riders {{are able}} to transfer for free to the three other metro-Atlanta transit systems: Gwinnett County Transit, Cobb Community Transit and GRTA Xpress. Some of these agreements require that neither system have significantly more transfers than the other. MARTA has stated {{that this is the}} case, that inbound (to MARTA from another system) and outbound (from MARTA to another system) transfers are approximately equal (for second quarter 2006, 8888 daily passengers transferred inbound and 8843 transferred outbound). Analysis of morning transfers (5 to 9am) to MARTA shows that Cobb County had 718 inbound transfers but only 528 outbound, Gwinnett County had 239 inbound and 269 outbound, and GRTA Xpress had 1,175 inbound but 615 outbound. Some have suggested that more people from the other systems may benefit from free transfers than those living in the MARTA service area. [...] However, it has been noted that workers traveling in the morning to Atlanta from another system will more than likely make the return trip home, resulting in an equal number of transfers.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the on-the-ground realities of upstream-downstream {{negotiations}} and transactions over ecosystem services. We explore the engagement, negotiation, implementation, and postimplementation phases of a "reciprocal water access" (RWA) agreement between village communities and municipal water users at Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, India. We aim to highlight how external actors drove the payments for ecosystem services agenda {{through a series of}} facilitation and research engagements, which were pivotal to the RWA's adoption, and how the <b>agreement</b> <b>fared</b> once external agents withdrew. In the postimplementation period, the RWA agreement continues to be upheld by upstream communities amidst evolving, competing land-use changes and claims. The introduction of cash payments for environmental services for forest-water relationships has given rise to multifaceted difficulties for the upstream hamlets, which has impeded the functionality of their forest management committee. Upstream communities' formal rights and abilities to control and manage their resources are dynamic and need strengthening and assurance; these developments result in fluctuating transaction and opportunity costs not originally envisaged by the RWA agreement. The paper demonstrates the importance of an explicit understanding of the local politics of negotiation and implementation to determine the effectiveness of compensation-based mechanisms for the supply of ecosystem services...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{integration}} of public transportation systems, focusing {{on the development of}} strategies to implement such goal for networks operated by different service agencies. A literature review on public transportation integration is initially presented, its main conclusion being that, even though many studies have identified a range of integration practices, only a few describe strategies to implement and materialize them in a multi agency context. The province of Gipuzkoa, in the Basque Country of Spain, is used as a case study to develop strategies which facilitate integration among different transit agencies. After describing the current services of the different agencies, two specific cases of integration are analyzed: fare integration between interurban and urban bus services in Donostia-San Sebastian and connectivity improvements between rail and bus services. The first case is analyzed quantitatively in great detail, given the availability of smartcard data describing the current utilization of the systems. This critical component of the work was possible thanks to the <b>fare</b> media integration <b>agreement</b> reached previously by the two agencies. The processing of the data {{on the use of the}} smartcard, reveals that not only transferring passengers are benefiting from the integration, which was the original intent of the agreement. In fact, regular urban passengers are also migrating to the interurban card due to a supposedly higher user convenience. Given the revenue sharing agreement subscribed by the two agencies, this migration implies unexpected high costs for the interurban agency. Since this agreement could obstruct further integration improvements, alternative agreements are proposed and evaluated. A recommendation is made for a new agreement that would lead to either reduced or free transfers without imposing high cost on either agency, while increasing their incentive to pursue further integration practices. In the second case, a connectivity improvement plan between rail and bus services is proposed. This plan prioritizes the available connectivity improvements not only according to their cost-benefit ratio, as the process regularly used by a single agency, but also with respect to whether the improvement could be implemented by a single agency or whether it requires inter agency negotiations. Further research on integration is proposed for Gipuzkoa based on the expected future integration of rail services into the current smartcard used in the bus system. by Julián Andrés Gómez Gélvez.
