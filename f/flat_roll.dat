40|$|This paper models {{linkages}} between {{upstream and downstream}} goods in the U. S. market for flat-rolled steel. These vertical linkages are important to account for when estimating the impact of trade restrictions on imports of <b>flat</b> <b>rolled</b> steel because some types of <b>flat</b> <b>rolled</b> steel are predominately used to produce other types of <b>flat</b> <b>rolled</b> steel {{and in some cases}} also make up a large share of their production costs.

Drawing upon this literature, this paper builds a vertically linked version of the CES COMPAS model that incorporates vertical linkages as constant cross price elasticities in both downstream supply functions and upstream factor demand functions. Compared to estimates from the CES COMPAS without vertical linkages, introduction of a trade restriction increases demand for upstream goods and decreases supply of downstream goods, increasing prices of both upstream and downstream goods, while increasing shipments of upstream goods and decreasing shipments of downstream goods. In estimating the impact of the safeguard measures imposed on the <b>flat</b> <b>rolled</b> steel market, accounting for the vertical linkages is most important when estimating the impact on domestically produced slab since all downstream products produced from slab were subject to the safeguard tariffs.

40|$|Abstract. A single {{roll caster}} {{equipped}} with a scraper was devised to cast the strip with sound free solidified surface. A property of this single caster is equipment of the scraper. Semisolid metal on the free solidified surface was scribed by a scraper and the surface became flat. Center line segregation did not occur as the strip was solidified from single side. The AA 5182 aluminum alloy could be cast at speeds up to 40 m/min. Thickness was about 3 mm. Pressure of the unit width from the scraper was ranging from 0. 1 N/mm to 1. 0 N/mm, and these pressure {{was enough to make}} the free solidified surface <b>flat.</b> <b>Roll</b> cast strip could be cold rolled down to 1 mm. There was not difference between roll contact surface and the free solidified surface after cold rolling by a visual examination. Result of tension test of the roll cast strip was as same as that of D. C. cast and rolled strip. Deep drawing test was operated at the conditions both of the roll contact surface and the free solidified surface was outside. LDR (limited drawing ratio) was same at both conditions and they were 1. 8. Thickness of the strip was controlled by the roll speed, solidification length (length of the melt pool) and pressure of the scraper. The single roll caster is simpler than a twin roll caster. Rigidity for rolling was not needed for the single roll caster. Cost of the roll is half comparing a twin roll caster. The equipment cost of the single roll caster is more economy than that of the twin roll caster...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the investigation and}} application of porous media mechanics and elasto-plastic constitutive theory for the crushing of prepared sugar cane using finite element simulation. This research specifically investigates the experiments carried out on C. R. Murry Advanced Experimental Milling Facility using cane that has also passed {{through a series of}} basic tests to characterise its properties for the computational models. For isotropic plastic material behaviour, constitutive models that represent yielding under hydrostatic pressures are applied. The constitutive behaviour of the solid skeleton, and the plastic strain hardening response are derived from a series of slow speed confined uniaxial compression experiments. The liquid flow within fibrous solid matrix of prepared cane is modelled by applying Darcy's law, and the coefficient of permeability therefore was determined experimentally. The finite element technique applied to the crushing process, couple the elastoplastic constitutive theory for the solid fibre and the Darcy's liquid flow theory for the liquid juice in conjunction with the frictional relation between the roller and blanket material. The material law has been coded initially into a two-dimensional plane strain computer model. Series of experiments on two-roll mill was conducted. The two-dimensional plane strain model predicted the roll load in agreement with experimental values, however failed to capture the tangential component of compression and the torque values were 50 % lower than the experimental values. However, numerical prediction of a <b>flat</b> <b>roll</b> surface matched well in roll load and torque with experimental values as the stress levels associated with grooves are absent. The rolls were then modelled with grooves in threedimension. The three-dimensional model captured high and low compression regions in groove tip and base respectively.

Load calculations were obtained using the temperature values for rod rolling obtained by the “Phantom Roll” method. Investigations were carried out for four different starting mean rolling temperatures between 900 - 1200 oC, and four different rolling strain rates of 0. 8, 0. 4, 1. 2, and 1. 6 s- 1. Results obtained showed that for all cases, rolling in grooved rolls required more power (higher load) compared to rolling in <b>flat</b> <b>rolls.</b> Loads were higher for lower rolling temperatures for both <b>flat</b> <b>rolls</b> or grooved rolls. An increase in rolling speed also corresponded {{to an increase in}} load for both grooved and <b>flat</b> <b>rolls.</b> Straight-line equations fitted load against log 10 Z (where Z is Zener-Hollomon’s Parameter) at temperatures of 988 oC, 1094 oC, and 1095 oC while two straight lines fitted the highest temperature of 1191 oC in checking the combined effect of temperature and strain rate on load. This abnormal behavior is probably due to strain localization in two distinct zones caused by re-crystallization and incomplete recovery during working at the highest temperature of 1191 oC.

40|$|The viscous and {{inviscid}} linear {{stability of}} the incompressible flow past a square open cavity is studied numerically. The analysis shows that the flow first undergoes a steady three-dimensional bifurcation at a critical Reynolds number of 1370. The critical mode is localized inside the cavity and has a <b>flat</b> <b>roll</b> structure with a spanwise wavelength of about 0. 47 cavity depths. The adjoint global mode reveals that the instability is most efficiently triggered in the thin region close to the upstream tip of the cavity. The structural sensitivity analysis identifies the wavemaker as the region located inside the cavity and spatially concentrated around a closed orbit. As the flow outside the cavity plays {{no role in the}} generation mechanisms leading to the bifurcation, we confirm that an appropriate parameter to describe the critical conditions in open cavity flows is the Reynolds number based on the average velocity between the two upper edges. Stabilization is achieved by a decrease of the total momentum inside the shear layer that drives the core vortex within the cavity. The mechanism of instability is then studied by means of a short-wavelength approximation considering pressureless inviscid modes. The closed streamline related to the maximum inviscid growth rate is found to be the same as that around which the global wavemaker is concentrated. The structural sensitivity field based on direct and adjoint eigenmodes, computed at a Reynolds number far higher than that of the base flow, can predict the critical orbit on which the main instabilities inside the cavity arise. Further, we show that the sub-leading unstable time-dependent modes emerging at supercritical conditions are characterized by a period that is a multiple of the revolution time of Lagrangian particles along the orbit of maximum growth rate. The eigenfrequencies of these modes, computed by global stability analysis, are in very good agreement with the asymptotic results...|$|E
40|$|A {{layer of}} oxide scale is inevitably formed {{on the strip}} surface due to the high {{temperature}} of the hot strip rolling process. Experimental result indicates that the oxide scale surface is rough {{no matter what the}} original state of the steel surface is. The oxide scale layer and its surface roughness {{play an important role in}} the hot strip rolling process. They may affect the friction and heat transfer and consequently affect the rolling force, torque and energy consumption of the rolling process. Surface roughness is also an important index of rolled strip quality. Hot rolling process and many involved factors have been studied by many researchers. Many models were developed to describe hot strip rolling process and various phenomena in the process. But a model that actually describes the geometrical profile of the rough surface has not been reported. A model that includes oxide scale layer and its surface roughness can better describe the rolling process so that the transformation of the surface roughness can be better understood. The goal of this research is to establish such a model and obtain the required information of the surface roughness transformation and scale layer deformation. In this thesis, a mathematical model is presented to describe the profile of the surface asperity. The algorithms to generate 3 D rough surface or 2 D rough surface section through the model are also presented. The model can generate random surface roughness and yet the profiles generated are still relatively simple for the convenience of further FEM analysis. The comparison of generated and scanned surface profiles shows that the model can generate a rough surface that fits very well the actual rough surface of the oxide scale of the strip. A circular roll model and a <b>flat</b> <b>roll</b> model, which include the oxide scale layer and profiles of the rough surface, have been developed to simulate the hot strip rolling process. With these models, deformation of the oxide scale layer and the transformation of the surface roughness in the rolling process can be calculated. Other important rolling parameters such as pressure distribution and real area of contact ratio can also be obtained through such models. Comparing the parameters obtained through simulation with those from the experiments, the models developed are effective in calculating these parameters. A developed thermo-mechanical coupling FEM analysis has also been implemented with such models. Many factors may affect the deformation of oxide scale layer and the surface roughness transformation in the hot strip rolling process. The effects of these factors such as Flow stress of oxide scale and steel materials Initial roughness Reduction Work roll surface roughness Scale layer thickness Lubrication Voids inside the scale layer Coefficients of friction on the interfaces of tool-scale and scale-steel Wavelength of the asperity on the scale layer deformation and the surface roughness transformation have been evaluated through the developed models. Simulation results compare closely to the experimental results, which are obtained from the experiments in Gleeble 3000 and experimental rolling mill Hille 100, in scale surface roughness change and other parameters for the hot strip rolling process. The oxide scale layer may crack before or inside the roll bite. The development of the pre-existed openings in the oxide scale layer is simulated. The effect of the ratio of the initial opening width over scale layer thickness, frictional coefficient on the tool-scale and scale-steel interfaces, profile roughness of the interfaces and the lubrication on the propagation of the crack in the rolling process is explored. A model of the crack generation from a weak position in the oxide scale layer has also been developed and the final crack width is in agreement with experimental results. After careful calculation and comparing with the experimental results, a series of conclusions is drawn and further work for the research in this area is recommended...|$|E
