In this case, awide variety of photocatalysts (TiO 2, Si-TiO 2, TiO 2 −xNy, Ag-TiO 2, Mo-TiO 2, ZnO, SnO 2 -Ag,Nb 2 O 5 and C 60 fullerene) were evaluated towards the removal of different molecules. Similarly, substrates such as glass, silica, sapphire, polycarbonate, aluminium, stainless steel,concrete and mortar were included in this issue. This information certainly contributes to a betterunderstanding of the photocatalytic removal of different molecules (e. g., Escherichia coli,Staphylococcus aureus, resazuring, rhodamine B, methylene blue, <b>Demeton-S,</b> 2 -chloroethylphenyl sulfide (CEPS) and NOx (NO and NO 2)) and the coating technologies required forsuch performances. Based on these interesting results, I encourage you to read through thisSpecial Issue and use the valuable information provided therein to help us move forward inthe exciting area of photocatalytic coatings for developing air-purifying, self-cleaning, andantimicrobial properties...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{technique}} {{has been developed}} to prepare core colloids that are modified using zirconium oxychloride, based on heating a solution of core colloid composites, consisting of poly (ethylenimine) (PEI) and zirconium oxychloride. The interaction of zirconium oxychloride with the polystyrene (PS) core colloids has been investigated using Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data. FT-IR studies confirm the occurrence of amine groups present in PEI which are oxidized to carboxyl groups after the reaction. The EDX data and the SEM images confirm the presence of zirconium particles immobilized on the polystyrene surfaces. Demeton, a highly toxic nerve agent, was used due to its ability to easily bind through its organophosphate group illustrating a practical application of the PS-PEI-Zr particles. Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) Spectroscopy {{was used to assess}} the interactions between the toxic nerve agent <b>demeton-S</b> and the PS-PEI-Zr particles. The results show that the presented technique for coating polystyrene core colloids with zirconium was successfully accomplished, and the newly formed particles easily bond with demeton agents through the P=O functional group...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaf 21). Organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) is an enzyme capable of degrading toxic organophosphorus chemicals including the chemical warfare agents, sarin and VX, as well as many insecticides. This project seeks to understand how structure contributes to the enzyme's activity and stability by identifying regions of the enzyme necessary for each. PCR mutagenesis was used to create 67 variant forms of the gene that encodes OPH. Eight variant genes were then sequenced to locate the mutations in the enzymes' structure. Two of the eight variants contained only silent mutations and expressed wild-type OPH protein. The mutations made in two of the variants prevented the protein from being expressed. Characterization of the enzymes relative to two substrates, paraoxon and <b>demeton-S,</b> indicated that six variants had severely decreased activity. Five of these variants contained mutations in regions that have previously been shown to affect the enzyme's activity. Only one variant, 12, contained a mutation in a novel region of the enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Acesso restrito: Texto completo. p. 56 - 61. In {{the past}} few years, organophosphorus {{compounds}} {{become one of the}} most widely used classes of pesticides due to their acute toxicity against a wide variety of pests. In this work, a method based on solid-phase microextraction in mode headspace (HS-SPME) coupled to gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was developed and optimized throughmultivariate factorial design to determine residues of organophosphorus pesticides in cow's milk. Different parameters of the method were evaluated, such as fiber type, temperature, extraction and desorption times, sample volume, effect of salt addition and stirring velocities. The evaluated pesticideswere dichlorvos, sulfotep, <b>demeton-S,</b> dimpylate, disulfoton, parathion,methylparathion, fenitrothion, chlorpyrifos and ethion. The best results were obtained using polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene fiber and headspacemode at 90 °C for 45 min, alongwith stirring at 600 rpmand desorption for 5 min at 250 °C. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed methodology was able to determine all of the pesticides with variation coefficients between 6. 1 % and 29. 5 %. Detection and quantification limits ranged from 2. 16 to 10. 85 μg L− 1 and from 6. 5 to 32. 9 μg L− 1, respectively. To evaluate residues of these pesticides inmilk, cows were exposed to the pesticides of interest andmilkwas collected after 24 h. The developedmethodwas able to detect traceamounts of these pesticides in the collected milk samples...|$|E
40|$|There {{are some}} 15, 000 known organophosphorus chemicals. Some of these OP?s, {{including}} VX and paraoxon, demonstrate an acute neurotoxicity {{due to the}} inhibition of cholinergic enzymes. Organophosphorus chemical warfare agents and pesticide neurotoxins are subject to hydrolysis by OP degrading enzymes. To be useful as a bioremediation or anti-chemical warfare agent, the enzyme must be tailored for, and integrated into, a practical application platform. Several studies have established enzyme-based countermeasures, describing such diverse applications as decontaminating foams for surface remediation, encapsulating enzyme with liposome for in vivo therapy, enzyme attachments to surfaces for biosensors and development of a corn expression system for large-scale enzyme production. The goal of the research described here is to select, investigate and improve the operational potential of organophosphate-degrading enzymes including Organophosphorus Hydrolase (OPH, 3. 1. 8. 1) and Organophosphorus Acid Anhydrolase (OPAA, 3. 1. 8. 2). Using saturation kinetics, the catalytic efficiencies of these two major detoxification enzymes were characterized with substrates representing each class of OP neurotoxin, phosphotriester, phosphothioate and phosphofluoridate. OPH presents superior kinetic parameters with each OP class tested. Variants of OPH were created to increase the operational effectiveness of OP hydrolytic enzymes against phosphorothioates. An H 254 S/H 257 L mutation in the active site resulted in an improvement in the kinetics (kcat/KM) for the phosphorothioate, <b>demeton-S.</b> To screen potential vascular protection therapies, an in vitro protocol was developed to predict enzymatic effectiveness for protection of acetylcholinesterase from acute OP-inhibition. The protection abilities of the enzymes were directly related to their second order rate constants as inhibitory levels of OP are below the KM of the enzymes. Consideration of contaminant nature concentration and enzyme kinetic parameters, kcat and KM, is critical to understanding decontamination and effective use of enzyme technology. These technologies continue to develop and provide promising new decontamination tools for OP compounds...|$|E
40|$|Phosphotriesterase (PTE) {{isolated}} from the soil bacterium Flavobacterium sp. {{is a member of}} the amidohydrolase superfamily. PTE catalyzes the hydrolysis of a broad spectrum of organophosphate triesters including the insecticide paraoxon, and the chemical warfare agents; GF, sarin, and soman. In addition, PTE has been shown to catalytically hydrolyze the lethal nerve agent, VX. However, the rate of VX hydrolysis is significantly slower. PTE was subjected to directed evolution studies to identify variants with enhanced activity towards VX hydrolysis. First generation libraries targeted amino acid residues in the substrate binding site. The H 254 A mutation displayed a 4 -fold enhancement in kcat and a 2 -fold enhancement in kcat/Km over wild type PTE. The double mutant H 254 Q/H 257 F was {{isolated from}} the second generation libraries and displayed a 10 -fold enhancement in kcat and a 3 -fold enhancement in kcat/Km. In addition, H 254 Q/H 257 F displayed a 9 -fold enhancement in kcat/Km for the hydrolysis of the VX analog, <b>demeton-S.</b> An in vivo selection approach utilizing organophosphate triesters as the sole phosphorus source is discussed. The selection is based on co-expressing PTE with the phosphodiesterase (GpdQ) from E. aerogenes. Substrate specificity of GpdQ was investigated using a small library of structurally diverse organophosphate diesters and phosphonate monoesters. Results obtained from the in vivo growth assays showed that GpdQ enabled E. coli to utilize various organophosphate diesters and phosphonate monoesters as the sole phosphorus source. Cells co-expressing PTE and GpdQ were tested for their ability to utilize two different organophosphate triesters as the sole phosphorus source. The results from this experiment indicate that the growth rate is limited by the phosphotriesterase activity. Protein translocation to the periplasm was proven advantageous for in vivo selection since it overcomes the limitation of intercellular delivery of the substrate of interest. Translocation of PTE to the periplasmic space of E. coli was examined. Two signal peptides were tested; the native leader peptide from Flavobacterium sp. and the signal sequence of alkaline phosphatase. The results obtained from cellular fractionation indicated that neither signal peptides were able to translocate PTE to the periplasm and that the protein remained in the cytoplasm...|$|E
40|$|Rice (Oryza sativa), early watergrass (Echinochloa oryzoides); EWG; biotypes {{resistant}} (R) and susceptible (S) to thiocarbamates and aryloxyphenoxy propionate herbicides), {{and late}} watergrass (Echinochloa phyllopogon; LWG; R and S biotypes) {{were exposed to}} clomazone for 7 d. Whole-plant change in fresh weight and B-carotene concentrations were measured. For growth, the No Observed Effect Concentrations (NOECs) were 7. 9, 0. 21, 0. 21, 0. 46, and 0. 46 µM clomazone for rice, EWG (R), EWG (S), LWG (R), and LWG (S), respectively, while the concentrations causing 25 % inhibition in response (IC 25 s) were 5. 6, 0. 46, 0. 42, 0. 92 and 0. 79 µM clomazone, respectively. For rice, EWG (R), EWG (S), LWG (R), and LWG (S), the B-carotene NOECs were 0. 21, < 0. 08, < 0. 08, 0. 08 and 0. 46 µM clomazone, respectively and IC 25 s were 0. 42, 0. 08, 0. 08, 0. 33 and 0. 54 µM, respectively. At a field-relevant clomazone application rate resistance to clomazone was observed in EWG (R) and LWG (R) as measured by growth and B-carotene, respectively. Due to similar sensitivity between rice and late watergrass, use of clomazone in rice culture may {{require the use of}} a safening technique. Rice and EWG (S) were exposed to 14 C-labeled clomazone to determine accumulation, biotransformation and mass balance. In terms of extractable 14 C, rice contained more total residues than EWG (p < 0. 05), but the concentration in EWG was significantly higher (p < 0. 01). More metabolized residue was measured in EWG compared to rice (p < 0. 01). Both species produced hydroxylated forms of clomazone, B-D-glucoside conjugates, and unidentified polar metabolites. The suspected active metabolite, 5 -ketoclomazone, was found at a significantly higher concentration in EWG vs. rice (21 ± 2 vs. 5. 7 ± 0. 5 pmol g- 1, respectively; p < 0. 01). Qualitatively and quantitatively, more clomazone metabolism was observed in the relatively sensitive EWG compared to rice. R and S biotypes of EWG and LWG were exposed to clomazone alone and in combination with P 450 inhibitors. Growth reduction (GR 25, GR 50, and GR 75) values were lower for S biotypes than for R biotypes (p < 0. 05) with exposure to clomazone alone indicating resistance to clomazone in the R biotypes. In combination with clomazone disulfoton increased 20 -d growth in LWG (R) by as much as 5 -fold, compared to application of clomazone alone. Oxydemeton methyl increased 20 -d growth by as much as 6 -fold. Disulfoton and oxydemeton methyl reduced !) -carotene levels compared to treatment with clomazone alone. For EWG (S), disulfoton increased 4 -d growth by 46 % and increased B-carotene levels by 52 %. <b>Demeton-S</b> increased B-carotene levels by 48 %. At 6800 g ai ha- 1 PBO increased growth and B-carotene levels by 28 and 48 %, respectively. These results indicate that P 450 enzymes serve both to activate and detoxify clomazone...|$|E
