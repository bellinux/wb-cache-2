5|$|A report {{written by}} the Department of Defense {{a year after the}} breach found that Manning's {{document}} leaks had no significant strategic impact on U.S. war efforts. The heavily redacted final report was not published until June 2017, after a Freedom of <b>Information</b> <b>request</b> by investigative reporter Jason Leopold.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{publicity}} the correspondence created, a freedom of <b>information</b> <b>request</b> was lodged concerning Project A119. It was only then that A Study of Lunar Research Flights– Volume I was made public, over forty years after its inception. A search for the other volumes of documentation revealed that other reports were destroyed in the 1980s by the Illinois Institute of Technology.|$|E
5|$|Global News {{reporter}} Jennifer Tryon {{attempted to}} file a Freedom of <b>Information</b> <b>request</b> for documents on June 29, but was refused; an employee came out {{from the back of}} the offices, and turned the City Clerk's chair around, so that they couldn't respond. City officials then called the OPP. After the request, the city issued a two line statement that documents are now part of investigations. OPP noted that the documents are still available through Freedom of Information requests, and that the situation likely didn't warrant an emergency call to police. The reporter was provided a FOI application on police arrival, and told to ignore instructions from their superiors on calling police. Tryon, producer Kieron O'Dea and cameraman Trevor Owens would later receive a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Breaking National News Reportage at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} information needs of patient families and hospital staff at a pediatric hospital system in Dallas, Texas. Library statistics recorded in four hospital libraries from 2011 - 2013 {{were used to}} analyze the <b>information</b> <b>requests</b> from patient families and hospital staff. Crosstabulations revealed the extent to which patient families and hospital staff used the libraries to satisfy their information needs. The data showed that patient families used the libraries very differently than hospital staff. Chi-square tests for independence were performed to identify the relationships between the Classification (Patient Family, Hospital Staff) and two descriptors of <b>information</b> needs (<b>Request</b> Type, Resources Used). There were a total of 1, 406 <b>information</b> <b>requests</b> analyzed. The data showed that patient families and hospital staff <b>information</b> <b>requests</b> differed greatly in the number of <b>information</b> <b>requests,</b> the type of <b>information</b> <b>requested,</b> the resources used and the time the library staff spent on the requests. Chi-square analyses revealed relationships statistically significant at the p <. 05 level; however, the strength of the relationships varied...|$|R
5|$|The {{project has}} been criticised for its delayed {{completion}} date; in 2009 the Department for Transport confirmed that Network Rail was developing High Level Output Specification options for the station, with an estimated date for the re-opening of the platforms of 2014, seven years after their closure. The cost of maintaining the disused platforms up to late 2010 was found via a Freedom of <b>Information</b> <b>request</b> to have been £4.1million. South West Trains subsequently confirmed that platform 20 would be brought back into use in 2014, hosting certain services to and from Reading, Windsor, Staines and Hounslow. These would be 10-car trains newly formed from refurbished SWT and former Gatwick Express rolling stock. Platform 20 reopened in May, with access via platform 19, and platforms 21 and 22 in October after steps were constructed over the former Eurostar entrance to access the platforms.|$|E

25|$|A Freedom of <b>Information</b> <b>request</b> in 2005 {{revealed}} that Eton had received £2,652 in farming subsidies in 2004 under the Common Agricultural Policy.

Panorama revealed in March 2012 that farming subsidies were granted to Eton for 'environmental improvements', in effect 'being paid without having to do any farming at all'.|$|E

25|$|In January 2009 Harriet Harman, Leader of the House of Commons, tabled {{a motion}} which would exempt MPs' {{expenses}} from being disclosed under a Freedom of <b>Information</b> <b>request,</b> {{in order to}} prevent any further disclosure of information. Labour MPs were placed under a three line whip in order to force the motion through the Commons. However, opposition parties stated they would vote against the proposals, and large-scale public opposition emerged. The proposals were ultimately dropped on 21 January 2009. The Commons authorities announced that full disclosure of all MPs’ expenses would be published on 1 July 2009.|$|E

The group recognises five potential types: Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and Saab JAS 39 Gripen.

25|$|A Freedom of <b>Information</b> <b>request</b> in 2015 {{revealed}} that the university received 25,071 undergraduate applications and made 18,380 offers in 2014-15. This yielded an acceptance rate of 15.8% and an offer rate of 73.3%. Particular competitive courses include Law, Economics and courses within the Warwick Business School which yielded offer rates of 53.8%, 57.2% and 58.9% respectively. Warwick students also average top A-Level grades with new entrants in 2015 amassing an average of 478 UCAS points, the equivalent of AAAaa at A-level - the 12th highest in the country.

25|$|While giving McAuliffe {{misinformation}} informally was not illegal, {{it was a}} crime under s. 67.1 of the Access to Information Act for {{the government}} to release forged documents in response to an Access to <b>Information</b> <b>request.</b> The question quickly emerged of whether Chief of Defence Staff Jean Boyle had known about the altering, and if he bore responsibility for it even if he were ignorant of his underlings' doings. On September 5, 1995, a clerk at the NDHQ was discovered collecting Somalia-related documents for a burn bag to be destroyed. Boyle later concurred that there had been documents proving attempts to cover up details of both the March 4 and March 16 killings.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010, The Guardian {{revealed}} the {{out of court}} payment to Goodman on grounds of settling an unfair dismissal case, and the later subsequent payment to Mulcaire. This started {{a new series of}} both newspaper stories, and subsequent further written questions from the Commons Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, to both News International and its executives. In February 2010, The Guardian reported that three mobile phone companies had discovered that over a hundred of their customers had had their voicemails hacked. The companies identified the customers in 2007, after Scotland Yard disclosed numbers that had been accessed by Goodman and Mulcaire. A freedom of <b>information</b> <b>request</b> by The Guardian found that the police had recovered 91 PIN codes for accessing other people's voicemails in material seized from Mulcaire and Goodman. In April 2010, it was revealed from Crown Prosecution Service documents that although police had named only eight individuals in court, the Scotland Yard inquiry had actually uncovered over 4,000 names or partial names and nearly 3,000 full or partial telephone numbers from the materials seized from Mulcaire and Goodman.|$|E
