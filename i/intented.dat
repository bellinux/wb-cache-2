6000|$|As God hath {{contrived}} all {{the works}} of nature to be useful, and in some manner a support to each other, by which the whole frame of the world under his providence is preserved and kept up; so, among mankind, our particular stations are appointed {{to each of us}} by God Almighty, wherein we are obliged to act, as far as our power reacheth, toward the good of the whole community. And he who doth not perform that part assigned him, toward advancing the benefit of the whole, in proportion to his opportunities and abilities, is not only a useless, but a very mischievous member of the public: Because he taketh his share of the profit, and yet leaves his share of the burden to be borne by others, which is the true principal cause of most miseries and misfortunes in life. For, a wise man who doth not assist with his counsels, a great man with his protection, a rich man with his bounty and charity, and a poor man with his labour, are perfect nuisances in a commonwealth. Neither is any condition of life more honourable in the sight of God than another; otherwise he would be a respecter of persons, which he assureth us he is not: For he hath proposed the same salvation to all men, and hath only placed them in different ways or stations to work it out. Princes are born with no more advantages of strength or wisdom than other men; and, by an unhappy education, are usually more defective in both than thousands of their subjects. They depend for every necessary of life upon the meanest of their people: Besides, obedience and subjection were never enjoined by God to humour the passions, lusts, and vanities of those who demand them from us; but we are commanded to obey our governors, because disobedience would breed seditions in the state. Thus servants are directed to obey their masters, children their parents, and wives their husbands; not from any respect of persons in God, but because otherwise there would be nothing but confusion in private families. This matter will be clearly explained, by considering the comparison which St Paul maketh between the Church of Christ and the body of man: For the same resemblance will hold, not only to families and kingdoms, but to the whole corporation of mankind. [...] "The eye," [...] saith he,[4] [...] "cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of thee. Nay, much more, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble, are necessary. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it." [...] The case is directly the same among mankind. The prince cannot say to the merchant, I have no need of thee; nor the merchant to the labourer, I have no need of thee. Nay, much more those members, &c. For the poor are generally more necessary members of the commonwealth than the rich: Which clearly shews, that God never <b>intented</b> such possessions for the sake and service of those to whom he lends them: but because he hath assigned every man his particular station to be useful in life; and this for the reason given by the apostle, [...] "that there should be no schism in the body."[5] ...|$|E

There are several ways to generate a new <b>intent.</b> Some algorithms (in particular, incremental ones) intersect a generated <b>intent</b> with some object <b>intent.</b> Other algorithms compute an <b>intent</b> explicitly intersecting all objects of the corresponding extent. There are algorithms that, starting from object <b>intents,</b> create new <b>intents</b> by intersecting already obtained <b>intents.</b> Lastly, one of the algorithms does not use the intersection operation to generate <b>intents.</b> It forms new <b>intents</b> by adding attributes to those already generated and tests some condition on supports of attribute sets (a support of an attribute set is the number of objects whose <b>intents</b> contain all attributes from this set) to realize whether an attribute set is an <b>intent.</b>|$|R

30|$|In {{the context}} of Android’s ICC, when an {{application}} component intends to communicate with other component(s), it sends an explicit <b>intent</b> by providing {{the name of the}} component (if known), otherwise, an implicit <b>intent</b> (without the target name) is sent. Explicit <b>intent</b> does not require any evaluation and are simple to understand, while implicit <b>intent</b> requires a number of tests done by the system before an <b>intent</b> is passed on to an appropriate component. The existing specifications of <b>intents,</b> <b>intent</b> filters and the mechanism used to match a particular message request by a source component to a target component is informal and can not be used within formal proofs. In this section, the structure of implicit <b>intent,</b> <b>intent</b> filter and the mechanism to find the most appropriate component to receive implicit <b>intent</b> are formalized in theorem prover Coq. Such a formal definition can be used to prove theorems about <b>intents,</b> <b>intent</b> filters and inter-component communication using the Coq proof facility and the proof script can be checked mechanically using the Coq proof checker. The Coq source code and proofs of theorems are available on-line at [24].|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} questions posed {{for this work}} were as follows: Can speech recognition and techniques for topic spotting {{be used to identify}} spoken <b>intent</b> in unconstrained natural speech? Can gesture recognition systems based on statistical speech recognition techniques be used {{to bridge the gap between}} physical movements and recognition of gestural <b>intent?</b> How can speech and gesture be combined to identify the overall communicative <b>intent</b> of a participant with better accuracy than recognisers built for individual modalities? In order to answer these questions a corpus collection experiment for Human-Robotic Interaction was designed to record unconstrained natural speech and 3 dimensional motion data from 17 different participants. A speech recognition system was built based on the popular Hidden Markov Model Toolkit and a topic spotting algorithm based on usefulness measures was designed. These were combined to create a speech <b>intent</b> recognition system capable of identifying <b>intent</b> given natural unconstrained speech. A gesture <b>intent</b> recogniser was built using the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit to identify <b>intent</b> directly from 3 D motion data. Both the speech and gesture <b>intent</b> recognition systems were evaluated separately. The output from both systems were then combined and this integrated <b>intent</b> recogniser was shown to perform better than each recogniser separately. Both linear and non-linear methods of multimodal <b>intent</b> fusion were evaluated and the same techniques were applied to the output from individual <b>intent</b> recognisers. In all cases the non-linear combination of <b>intent</b> gave the highest performance for all <b>intent</b> recognition systems. Combination of speech and gestural <b>intent</b> scores gave a maximum classification performance of 76. 7 % of <b>intents</b> correctly classified using a two layer Multi-Layer Perceptron for non-linear fusion with human transcribed speech input to the speech classifier. When compared to simply picking the highest scoring single modality <b>intent,</b> this represents an improvement of 177. 9 % over gestural <b>intent</b> classification, 67. 5 % over a human transcription of speech based speech <b>intent</b> classifier and 204. 4 % over an automatically recognised speech based speech <b>intent</b> classifier.

30|$|Communication {{based on}} <b>intents</b> {{can be with}} or without the target {{component}} name in <b>intent.</b> If a target name is included in the <b>intent</b> (explicit <b>intent),</b> Android system passes on the <b>intent</b> to the target component. Inter-component communication using explicit <b>intent</b> is straight forward and is not included in this work. To address a component using an <b>intent</b> without the target component name (implicit <b>intent),</b> a general action is declared and the target is resolved by the Android system (runtime). The type of action in implicit <b>intent,</b> to be performed by a component, enables the system to find a set of appropriate components for that action. Finding the target component for an implicit <b>intent</b> is complicated: the system takes the <b>intent’s</b> data and looks for an appropriate set of components in the applications available on the mobile device. In case only one appropriate component is found, the system start that component, however, for more options, the system asks the user using a dialogue to choose from the list.|$|R

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of Web services, when developing a new application, {{it makes sense to}} seek and leverage existing Web services rather than implementing the corresponding components from scratch. Therefore, significant research efforts have been devoted to the techniques for service discovery and integration. However, most of the existing techniques are based on the ternary participant classification of the Web service architecture which only takes into consideration the involvement of service providers, service brokers, and application developers. The activities of application end users are usually ignored. This thesis presents an Intents-based service discovery and integration approach at the conceptual level inspired by two industrial protocols: Android <b>Intents</b> and Web <b>Intents.</b> The proposed approach is characterized by allowing application end users to participate in the process of service seeking. Instead of directly binding with remote services, application developers can set an <b>intent</b> which semantically represents their service goal. An <b>Intents</b> user agent can resolve the <b>intent</b> and generate a list of candidate services. Then application end users can choose a service as the ultimate working service. This thesis classifies <b>intents</b> into explicit <b>intents,</b> authoritative <b>intents,</b> and naïve <b>intents,</b> and examines in depth the issue of naïve <b>intent</b> resolution analytically and empirically. Based on the empirical analysis, an adaptive <b>intent</b> resolution approach is devised. This thesis also presents a design for the <b>Intents</b> user agent and demonstrates its proof-of-concept prototype. Finally, <b>Intents</b> and the <b>Intents</b> user agent are applied to integrate Web applications and native applications on mobile devices...|$|R
