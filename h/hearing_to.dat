5|$|In November 1978, Thorpe, Holmes {{and two of}} the latter's {{business}} acquaintances—John le Mesurier and George Deakin—appeared before magistrates at Minehead, Somerset, in a committal <b>hearing</b> <b>to</b> {{determine whether}} they should stand trial. The court heard evidence of a conspiracy from Scott, Newton and Bessell; it also learned that Bessell was being paid £50,000 by The Sunday Telegraph for his story. At the conclusion, the four defendants were committed for trial at the Old Bailey. This was set to begin on 30 April 1979, but when in March the government fell, and a general election was called for 3 May, the trial was postponed until 8 May.|$|E

Khan claims he is up to the challenge of taming the world and accepts Kirk's offer. Instead of a court-martial for Lt.McGivers, Kirk allows her to go into exile with Khan. Spock notes that {{it would be interesting to}} see what Khan makes of Ceti AlphaV in 100years.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} in 1994, the AMIA bombing targeting a Buenos Aires Jewish center, that killed 85 people and wounded 300. The investigation remained open for years, and prosecutor Alberto Nisman {{was appointed to the}} case. He accused Iran of organizing the attack, and the Hezbollah group of carrying it out. He intended to prosecute five Iranian officials, including former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, but Argentina signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran for a joint investigation. Nisman accused the president of signing that memorandum for oil and trade benefits, according to hundreds of hours of wiretaps. On 19 January 2015 he was found dead at his home, a day before a congressional <b>hearing</b> <b>to</b> explain his accusation, which caused a great controversy. As of 2016, both the cases of the AMIA bombing and the death of Nisman remain unresolved, and the courts declined at the time to investigate his denunciation of Kirchner.|$|E

5|$|The European {{nightjar}} {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, which it seizes in flight, often fly-catching from a perch. It hunts by sight, silhouetting its prey against the night sky. Its eyes are relatively large, each with a reflective layer, which improves night vision. It appears not to rely on its <b>hearing</b> <b>to</b> find insects and does not echolocate. Drinking and bathing take place during flight. Although it suffers a degree of predation and parasitism, the main threats to the species are habitat loss, disturbance and a reduction of its insect prey through pesticide use. Despite population decreases, its large numbers and huge breeding range mean that it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{appeal was}} heard and {{dismissed}} the following day, Thursday, 12 March 2015. As {{part of its}} legal argument, aside from raising safety concerns, Sauber also submitted that van der Garde's contract had been terminated by the team in February {{with the approval of}} the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)'s Contract Recognition Board in any event, and that van der Garde violated confidentiality clauses of the contract by discussing it with the media. Lawyers representing Ericsson and Nasr further argued that van der Garde had not followed due process by failing to give their clients prior notice of his legal action. The court upheld the previous orders to permit van der Garde to participate in the race and adjourned the <b>hearing</b> <b>to</b> the following day, Friday, 13 March 2015, to hear arguments on contempt of court proceedings launched by van der Garde's legal team against Sauber's team principal, Monisha Kaltenborn.|$|E
5|$|Tran {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in Sacramento County Superior Court on November 6, 2015, charged of the attempted murder of Stone with an allegation of using a dangerous weapon, a knife. He did not enter a plea, was ordered to be held without bail, and was scheduled to return to court December 1, 2015. On December 1, 2015, Tran again appeared in the Sacramento Superior Court for a bail review hearing. This was subsequently postponed, with Tran held without bail. On January 7th, 2016, Tran was again denied bail, and another preliminary hearing was set for February 26th, 2016. At the February 26th hearing, Sacramento County Deputy District Attorney Anthony Ortiz informed Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Goodman that his department plans to amend the original criminal charges against Tran, to include gang involvement in the assault. A gang involvement charge in California provides for additional penalties if the defendant is found guilty. Judge Goodman ordered another <b>hearing</b> <b>to</b> be held on March 30, 2016, {{to determine whether or}} not prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed with the charges against Tran.|$|E

Rejection refusing something of the hearer and rejection belongs to perlocutionary act. Rejection can be divided into direct rejection and indirect rejection. The research question of this research is focused on the rejection which is implemented by the author through his novel The Stars Shine Down. In collecting data, the writer paid attention to the utterances among the characters in the novel. The collected data were analyzed descriptively in terms of how rejection as perlocutionary act are found in the conversation among characters. The result shows that there are some aspects of perlocutionary in direct and indirect rejection, those are <b>to</b> bring <b>hearer</b> <b>to</b> know, <b>to</b> get <b>hearer</b> <b>to</b> think, <b>to</b> get <b>hearer</b> <b>to</b> do, irritate and distract attention...|$|R

5|$|On 8 June 2011, it was {{confirmed}} that the Westfield Shopping Centre had been in detailed talks with West Ham for naming rights of the new Olympic stadium which could be called the Westfield Stadium. West Ham announced plans to move from the Boleyn Ground from the 2014–15 season. In August 2011, an independent investigation initiated by the Olympic Park Legacy Company upheld the decision to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. On 29 June 2011, however, Tottenham announced that they were returning to the High Court again to fight the decision to award West Ham the stadium, in an oral <b>hearing,</b> <b>to</b> try and overturn the original high court appeal being rejected. On 25 August 2011, Tottenham and Leyton Orient were in fact granted a judicial review by the High Court into the Olympic Stadium bidding process. On 11 October 2011, the deal to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium collapsed over concerns of legal pressure, with the government deciding that the stadium will stay in public ownership. Six days later, Tottenham and Leyton Orient announced they had ended their legal challenge after the deal collapsed.|$|E
5|$|On August 10, 2001, on remand {{from the}} Florida Second District Court of Appeal, Judge Greer heard a motion from the Schindlers {{claiming}} that new medical treatment could restore sufficient cognitive ability such that Terri Schiavo herself {{would be able}} to decide to continue life-prolonging measures. The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to recuse himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001 the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary <b>hearing</b> <b>to</b> be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while Michael Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new independent physician to examine and evaluate Terri Schiavo's condition. (These decisions, all published in a single order by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo III in its later rulings.) In October 2002, on remand by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer's court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help Terri Schiavo restore any cognitive function. In preparation for the trial, a new computed axial tomography scan (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe cerebral atrophy. An EEG showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were Dr. William Maxfield, a radiologist, and four neurologists: Dr. William Hammesfahr, Dr. Ronald Cranford, Dr. Melvin Greer and Dr. Peter Bambakidis.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{returning}} from Flanders, the bishop was impeached in parliament, on 26 October 1383, {{in the presence of}} the king. The chancellor Michael de la Pole accused him of not mustering his troops at Calais, as had been agreed; not recruiting a high enough number of armed men; refusing to certify properly who his military leaders were; deceiving the king by not allowing a secular lord to command the expedition to Flanders; and disbanding his forces prematurely. Despenser denied all the charges, insisting that enough men had assembled at Ypres, that he had chosen his commanders well and that he had not refused to obey the king's orders. After de la Pole declared the bishop's replies to be insufficient, Despenser requested another <b>hearing</b> <b>to</b> defend himself still further, which was granted. In this hearing Despencer proceeded to blame his own commanders for forcing him to retreat from Ypres and then evacuate the garrisons. All his arguments were refuted and he was blamed for the failure of the expedition. His temporalities were confiscated and he was ordered to repay any costs taken from money gained from the French.|$|E

5|$|On July 8, 2010, Weber {{was named}} the fifth captain in Nashville Predators history, {{replacing}} Jason Arnott, who {{was traded to the}} New Jersey Devils. He became the youngest captain in franchise history and the only Predators captain to have been drafted by the team. On January 11, 2011, Weber was among 42 players named to the 58th National Hockey League All-Star Game in Raleigh, North Carolina. For {{the first time in its}} history, the NHL used a fantasy draft format to select teams for the All-Star Game, and Weber was selected eighth overall by Team Lidstrom. At the game, Weber recorded four assists and was a +6, finishing the game tied with Loui Eriksson for most points and second to Nicklas Lidström for best plus/minus. Shortly after his All-Star Game appearance, Weber recorded his 200th career NHL pointan assistin a game versus the Detroit Red Wings on February 9, 2011. During his sixth season with the Predators Weber averaged 25:19 in ice time, and set career highs in games played (82), assists (32) and shots on goal (25). Weber also contributed three goals and five points in 12 playoff games as the Predators lost to the Vancouver Canucks after advancing to the Western Conference Semifinals for the first time in their history. At the conclusion of the regular season, Weber was named one of three finalistsalong with Zdeno Chára and Nicklas Lidströmfor the Norris Trophy, the first finalist nomination of his career. He finished second in Norris Trophy voting, losing with 727 voting points to Lidström's 736. Weber also finished 25th in Hart Memorial Trophy voting with two fifth-place votes. For the first time in his career, Weber was voted to the NHL First All-Star Team after receiving 445 voting points, second among defencemen to Lidström's 464. On July 1, 2011, Weber became a restricted free agent; despite this, Weber had stated he wanted to remain with the Predators. To prevent the possibility of other teams signing him to an offer sheet, the Predators filed for salary arbitration with Weber, giving the team and Weber until their <b>hearing</b> <b>to</b> negotiate a new contract. Failing to come to terms on a new contract by their hearing, Weber's case went to arbitration on August 2 – the first time in NHL history that a team-elected arbitration candidate had reached a hearing. The following day, he was awarded a one-year, $7.5 million contract, from which the Predators could not walk away, as they, and not Weber, had elected arbitration.|$|E
