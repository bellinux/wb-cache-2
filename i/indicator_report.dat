The behavioral indicators are derived from objectives for F&V consumption outlined in Healthy People 2010, a framework for the nation's health priorities, and data is from CDC's health surveillance systems. The policy and environmental indicators are from multiple data sources and measure several aspects of a state's ability to support the consumption of F&V. Each indicator can be measured in most states. Individual states, however, may have data collected through state-wide surveys and/or have policies enacted outside the monitoring period that can augment the information in this State <b>Indicator</b> <b>Report</b> and thus can be used to further inform decision makers.

People who are physically active generally live longer {{and have a}} lower risk for heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, depression, some cancers, and obesity. Environmental and policy strategies such as access to safe places for physical activity, physical education and physical activity in schools and child care settings, and street-scale and community-scale design policy can help increase physical activity behavior among all AmericansThis report shows that physical activity among adults {{and high school students}} is higher in some states than others. Overall, most states have environmental and policy strategies in place that encourage physical activity. The State <b>Indicator</b> <b>Report</b> on Physical Activity, 2014, can be used to illustrate how states support physical activity and identify opportunities to improve access to environmental supports such as sidewalks or walking paths for active behavior. State health departments can work with governmental and non- governmental partners to create safe places for physical activity, to enhance physical education and physical activity in schools and child care settings, and to support street-scale and community-scale design policy. These partnerships will likely depend on the type of activities a state chooses to focus on. For example, some state departments of health, parks and recreation, and education may work together to help communities establish joint-use agreements that allow residents to use school physical activity facilities after school hours. To increase residents 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 access to safe sidewalks, state departments of health, transportation, and community organization may work together to support street-scale design policies.

40|$|The State <b>Indicator</b> <b>Report</b> on Physical Activity, 2010, {{provides}} information on physical activity behavior and policy and environmental supports within each state. Physical activity, essential to overall health, can help control weight, {{reduce the risk of}} heart disease and some cancers, strengthen bones and muscles, and improve mental health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) goal of increasing physical activity among all Americans is supported by key strategies such as creating or enhancing access to places for physical activity, enhancing physical education and activity in schools and physical activity in child care settings, and supporting urban design, land use, and transportation policies. National and state-specific information is reported in the State <b>Indicator</b> <b>Report</b> on Physical Activity, 2010, for behavioral, policy, and environmental indicators. The behavioral indicators are derived from physical activity recommendations outlined in Healthy People 2010 Objectives [...] our nation's framework for health priorities, and the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (2008 Guidelines) [...] a science-based guide on the types and amounts of physical activity that provide substantial health benefits for Americans. Behavioral indicator data are from CDC-supported health surveillance systems. This report also presents 12 policy and environmental indicators which are derived from strategies recommended by The Guide to Community Preventive Services, CDC's Guide to Strategies for Increasing Physical Activity in the Community, The Surgeon General's Vision for a Healthy and Fit Nation, and The National Physical Activity Plan. They are from multiple data sources and measure several aspects of a state's ability to support physical activity. Each indicator can be measured in most states.

40|$|The State <b>Indicator</b> <b>Report</b> on Fruits and Vegetables {{can be used}} to: Illustrate how states {{support the}} {{consumption}} of F&V; Monitor progress and celebrate state successes; Identify opportunities for improvement in F&V access. Fruits and vegetables (F&V) contribute important nutrients for the human body. Eating F&V lowers {{the risk of developing}} many chronic diseases and can also help with weight management. 1 Creating greater access to quality and affordable F&V nationwide is an important step to increase F&V consumption. When state leaders, health professionals, food retail owners, farmers, education staff, and community members work together, more Americans can live healthier lives. The State <b>Indicator</b> <b>Report</b> on Fruits and Vegetables, 2013 provides information for each state on fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption, and environmental and policy indicators of support for consumption. The report, which can be used to inform decision makers, shows that F&V consumption is higher in some states than others, but overall consumption of F&V in the United States is low. Adults in the United States consume fruit about 1. 1 times per day and vegetables about 1. 6 times per day. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 recommends that Americans eat more F&V as part of a healthy diet. The MyPlate food guidance system emphasizes the need to 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 focus on fruits 22 ̆ 0 ac? and 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 vary your veggies 22 ̆ 0 ac? as building blocks for a healthy diet (www. choosemyplate. gov). Many states are attempting to increase F&V consumption by improving access and establishing policies that make it easier to get F&V in communities, schools, and child are. For example, 28 states now have a farm to school/ preschool policy. Twenty-seven states have created state-level food policy councils [...] coalitions of private and public partners working together to improve access to healthy food.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how four high schools used an Early Warning <b>Indicator</b> <b>Report</b> (EWIR) to improve ninth grade {{promotion}} rates. Ninth grade on-time promotion is an early predictor of a student’s likelihood to graduate (Bornsheuer, Polonyi, Andrews, Fore, & Onwuegbuzie, 2011; Leckrone & Griffith, 2006; Roderick, Kelley-Kemple, Johnson, & Beechum, 2014; Zvoch, 2006). The analysis revealed both similarities and differences in the ways that the four schools used the EWIR. The research took place in a large urban school district in the Mid-Atlantic. Sixteen participants from four high schools and the district’s central office voluntarily participated in face-to-face interviews. The researcher utilized a qualitative case study method to examine the implementation of the EWIR system in Wyatt School District. The interview data was transcribed and analyzed, along with district documents, to identify categories in this cross case analysis. Three primary themes emerged from the data: (1) targeted school structures for EWIR implementation, (2) the EWIR identified necessary supports for students, and (3) the central office support for school staff. The findings revealed the various ways that the target schools implemented the EWIR in their buildings and the level of support that they received from the central office that aided them in using the EWIR to improve ninth grade promotion rates. Based on the findings of this study, the researcher provided a number of key recommendations: (1) Districts should provide professional development to schools to ensure that schools have the support they need to implement the EWIR successfully; (2) There should be increased accountability from the central office for schools using the EWIR to identify impactful interventions for ninth graders; and (3) The district needs to assign dedicated central office staff to support the implementation of the EWIR in high schools across the district. As schools continue to face the challenge of improving ninth grade promotion rates, effective use of an Early Warning <b>Indicator</b> <b>Report</b> is recommended to provide school and district staff with data needed to impact overall student performance...|$|E
