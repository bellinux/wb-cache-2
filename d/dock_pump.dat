50|$|Despite of the {{favourable}} economical situation, the profitability was {{far from}} satisfactory level. By 1877 Helsingfors Skeppsdocka owed 1,240,000 marks to Tampere Linen and Iron Industry. The company faced difficult times during the following two years; a significant cause was 54,000 marks' loss from four tug steamers delivered to the Russian Admiralty. By now the owner had come to conclusion, that the company will not reach a such profitability that it could repay the investment, and started to consider ways {{to get rid of}} the shipbuilder despite of the losses. According to an alternative plan, the dock and engineering works were to be separated to two different companies, and the dock was to be sold to cover the losses. In a general meeting held on 5 November 1978, the board suggested selling the <b>dock,</b> <b>pump</b> station and gate to a new company for 700,000 marks; the planned initial capital for the new dock company would be 800,000 marks. The proposal was approved, but not put into practice. In the meantime, the owner negotiated with three prospective purchasers for the business: a Saint-Petersburg-base British trading house, an unnamed domestic person and an agent.|$|E

The kilt-wearing Captain Donald Roy – 'The Laird' – and his 14-man assault troop were tasked with knocking out two pump-house roof-top gun emplacements high above the quayside and securing a bridge to provide a route for the raiding parties to exit the dock area. Roy and Sgt Don Randall used scaling ladders and grenades to accomplish the former, and a head-on rush to secure the bridge and form a bridgehead that enabled Capt. Bob Montgomery and Lt Corran Purdon and their demolition teams to exit the area.|$|R

2500|$|The Alexandra Dock {{was built}} {{to the west of}} the final section of the drain in the early 1880s. Research on the {{original}} Hull Dock had shown that around 1.25 million tons of mud were deposited in the dock each year, as a result of the muddy water of the Humber entering the dock for 2 to 3 hours at each high tide. In order to mitigate the high cost of dredging to remove this material, the water levels in the [...] dock were maintained by pumping fresh water from the Holderness Drain. Pumps capable of pumping 14.5 million cubic feet (410 Ml) per day were installed, resulting in significant savings in the cost of operating the <b>dock.</b> <b>Pumping</b> from the drain increased again in 1913, when the newly constructed King George V Dock opened, and again required clean water.

50|$|Operation Chariot {{was a plan}} to ram an explosive-laden warship {{into the}} dock gates. Accompanying her would {{be a number of}} small boats {{carrying}} British Commandos, who would destroy the <b>dock's</b> <b>pumping</b> and winding machinery and other infrastructure. The troops would then be evacuated by the small boats before the explosives in the ship detonated. A particular difficulty was that the dock was located several miles up the estuary of the Loire River. As an obsolescent destroyer, Campbeltown was considered to be expendable and was selected to be the ram-ship. She spent February undergoing modifications. These included removing her third and fourth funnels, and having the remaining two funnels raked to simulate the structure and appearance of a German Raubvogel-class torpedo boat. A 12-pounder gun was installed forward and eight 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons were mounted on the upper deck. Some extra armour was provided to protect the bridge structure, and unnecessary stores and equipment were removed to lighten the destroyer.|$|R

25|$|Loading a {{submarine}} was a lengthy process that took weeks. The {{first step was}} to pump the forward ballast tanks empty which elevated the bow out of the water. Once it was dismantled, the ballast tanks were then filled to lower the bow and flood the well deck to allow the submarine to be winched aboard. The well deck's water-tight doors were then closed and the water in the <b>dock</b> was <b>pumped</b> overboard while the submarine settled onto its wooden bilge blocks. The bow was then reassembled and hatch covers were installed over the well deck. These prevented the ship from taking on water during a storm and allowed the crew to perform any necessary maintenance on the submarine while under way.|$|R
30|$|Reaching 100 % confluence, cultured periosteal {{cells were}} {{transferred}} to the osteogenic induction medium. The plates were then placed into the new bioreactor in which the 6 -well plates are <b>docked.</b> A <b>pump</b> and a pressure reservoir generated vacuum waveforms to deform the wells and stretch the silicone membranes. The membranes with the cells were subjected to different levels of cyclic equibiaxial mechanical strain of 4 % strain at 0.5  Hz for 2 and 8  h. Tension force was measured by real-time image processing with a web camera that feeds back into the pressure controller. The range of tensile strain to deform the culture plate was measured as 4 % with the settings. This condition of biomechanical stimulation was defined through several preliminary cell studies on frequency and magnitude of mechanical strain. These preliminary studies are supposed be separately reported in another thesis.|$|R
50|$|The {{decline of}} the docks set in after World War II, when they {{suffered}} massive damage from German air raids. The South <b>Dock</b> was <b>pumped</b> dry and used for construction {{of some of the}} concrete caissons which made up the Mulberry Harbours used on D-Day. When the shipping industry adopted the container system of cargo transportation, the docks were unable to accommodate the much larger vessels needed by containerisation. They finally closed for lack of custom in 1969. The Grand Surrey Canal was closed in 1971 and was subsequently drained and filled in. The area remained derelict for over a decade, with much of the warehousing demolished and over 90% of the docks filled in. The only surviving areas of open water were Greenland Dock, South Dock, remnants of Canada Dock (renamed Canada Water), and a basin renamed Surrey Water. In 1981, the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher established the London Docklands Development Corporation to redevelop the former dockyard areas east of the City of London, including the Surrey Docks.|$|R

50|$|Polly Woodside {{was closed}} to the public on 30 April 2006 to allow for the major {{redevelopment}} of the lower Yarra River's southern bank. The $1.4 billion redevelopment, announced by the Victorian Government in February 2006, included construction works for the new Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre immediately next to the Polly Woodside. The ship was temporarily relocated approximately 50 metres away to a mooring on the adjacent Yarra River on 26 August 2008 - its first move in 33 years - for a $13 million operational refurbishment and restoration of its dry dock home, board walk, and adjacent former wharf sheds. Between this time and May 2009 the water within the Duke and Orr's Dry <b>Dock</b> was <b>pumped</b> out and a gated dam wall built at the entrance. The bottom of the dry dock was excavated and permanent keel supports built into the concrete base for Polly Woodside to sit upon, allowing the ship to be periodically dry docked for repairs. On 19 May 2009 the dam wall gates were opened allowing water to flow into the dry dock and Polly Woodside was returned to the Duke and Orr's Dry Dock. Polly Woodside was reopened to the public on 23 December 2010.|$|R
50|$|In 1944, the German Organisation Todt built a small {{labor camp}} on Ljanskollen hill in west Holmlia. The camp held about 250 people, {{most of them}} Norwegian {{political}} prisoners, and an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 men passed through the camp in all. The prisoners were treated relatively well compared to those in other Nazi camps, and the German guards even allowed Anlaug Thidemansen, then owner of Holm farm, {{to bring in a}} constant supply of canned soup for the prisoners. The prisoners were put to work building a tank to hold oil and gas. The plan was to have the gas/oil brought from the <b>docks</b> and then <b>pumped</b> into a nearby processing plant, where the finished product would be loaded directly onto trains. However, the processing facility wasn't completed before the occupation ended, so the tank was never in use.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] resumed {{the young}} engineer, [...] "here is still another method. We might send down your men {{to make all}} the openings,--ports, windows, etcetera--water-tight, fix a shield over the hole she knocked in her bottom on the cliffs, and then, by means of several water-pumps {{reaching}} from above the surface to the hold, clear her of water. When sufficiently floated by such means a steam-tug could haul her into port. The iron steamship London was, not long ago, raised and saved at Dundee in that way. She rose four feet after the pumps had been worked only two hours, and while she was being towed into <b>dock</b> the <b>pumps</b> were still kept going. It was a great success--and so may it be in this case. Then, you know, we might construct a pontoon by making a raft to float on a multitude of empty barrels, pass chains under the Seagull and fix them to this pontoon at low water, so that when the tide rose she would rise perforce along with the pontoon and tide, and could be moved inshore till she grounded; then, waiting for low tide, we could taughten the chains again, and repeat the process till we got her ashore. Or, better still, we could hire Siebe and Gorman's patent pontoon, which, if I mistake not, is much the same thing that I now suggest carried out to perfection." ...|$|R
