5|$|More unorthodox {{methods were}} also explored. Astrosystems International {{developed}} a so-called “Quartz Chamber” which burned pure oxygen and aircraft fuel, converting the chemical energy into light. The system was {{planned to be}} evaluated within a year, and installed in a similar arrangement to the more conventional BIAS. A plan, codenamed Moonshine, was also put forward.

25|$|As of June 2017, ISRO has {{launched}} 278 satellites, including 209 foreign ones using indigenously developed launch vehicles like SLV, ASLV, PSLV and GSLV.Though reliable, the PSLV can not launch satellites having mass greater than 1600kg.

25|$|The <b>Geosynchronous</b> <b>Satellite</b> Launch Vehicle, usually {{known by}} its {{abbreviation}} GSLV, is an expendable launch system developed to enable India to launch its INSAT-type satellites into geostationary orbit and to make India less dependent on foreign rockets. At present, it is ISRO's second-heaviest satellite launch vehicle and is capable of putting a total payload of up to 5 tons to Low Earth Orbit. The vehicle is built by India, originally with a cryogenic engine purchased from Russia, while the ISRO developed its own cryogenic engine.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{satellite}} for the SAARC region with 12 Ku-band transponders (36MHz each) and launch using the Indian <b>Geosynchronous</b> <b>Satellite</b> Launch Vehicle GSLV Mk-II. The {{total cost of}} launching the satellite {{is estimated to be}} about ₹2,350,000,000 (₹235 crore). The cost associated with the launch was met by the Government of India. The satellite enables full range of applications and services in the areas of telecommunication and broadcasting applications viz television (TV), direct-to-home (DTH), very small aperture terminals (VSATs), tele-education, telemedicine and disaster management support.|$|E
25|$|ISRO built India's first satellite, Aryabhata, {{which was}} {{launched}} by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1975. It was named after the Mathematician Aryabhata. In 1980, Rohini became the first satellite {{to be placed in}} orbit by an Indian-made launch vehicle, SLV-3. ISRO subsequently developed two other rockets: the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for launching satellites into polar orbits and the <b>Geosynchronous</b> <b>Satellite</b> Launch Vehicle (GSLV) for placing satellites into geostationary orbits. These rockets have launched numerous communications satellites and earth observation satellites. Satellite navigation systems like GAGAN and IRNSS have been deployed. In January 2014, ISRO successfully used an indigenous cryogenic engine in a GSLV-D5 launch of the GSAT-14.|$|E

25|$|As {{originally}} conceived, ISRO was {{to launch}} MOM on its <b>Geosynchronous</b> <b>Satellite</b> Launch Vehicle (GSLV), {{but as the}} GSLV failed twice in 2010 and ISRO was continuing to sort out issues with its cryogenic engine, it was not advisable {{to wait for the}} new batch of rockets as that would have delayed the MOM project for at least three years. ISRO opted to switch to the less-powerful Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). Since the PSLV was not powerful enough to place MOM on a direct-to-Mars trajectory, the spacecraft was launched into a highly elliptical Earth orbit and used its own thrusters over multiple perigee burns (to take advantage of the Oberth effect) to place itself on a trans-Mars trajectory.|$|E
25|$|ISRO sent one lunar orbiter, Chandrayaan-1, on 22 October 2008 one Mars orbiter, Mars Orbiter Mission, which {{successfully}} entered Mars orbit on 24 September 2014, making India {{the first}} nation to succeed {{on its first}} attempt, and ISRO the fourth space agency {{in the world as}} well as the first space agency in Asia to successfully reach Mars orbit. On 18 June 2016 ISRO successfully set a record with a launch of 20 satellites in a single payload, one being a satellite from Google. On 15 February 2017, ISRO launched 104 satellites in a single rocket (PSLV-C37) and created a world record. ISRO launched its heaviest rocket, <b>Geosynchronous</b> <b>Satellite</b> Launch Vehicle-Mark III (GSLV-Mk III), on 5 June 2017 and placed a communications satellite GSAT-19 in orbit. With this launch, ISRO became capable of launching 4 ton heavy satellites.|$|E
25|$|WT1190F (9U01FF6, UDA34A3, or UW8551D) {{was a small}} {{temporary}} satellite of Earth that impacted Earth on 13 November 2015 at 06:18:34.3 (±1.3 seconds) UTC. It {{is thought}} to have been space debris from the trans-lunar injection stage of the 1998 Lunar Prospector mission, It was first discovered on 18 February 2013 by the Catalina Sky Survey. It was then lost, and reacquired on 29 November 2013. It was again discovered on 3 October 2015, and the object was soon identified to be the same as the two objects previously sighted by the team, who have been sharing their data through the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center (MPC). An early orbit calculation showed that it was orbiting Earth in an extremely elliptical orbit, taking it from within the <b>geosynchronous</b> <b>satellite</b> ring to nearly twice the distance of the Moon. It was also probably the same object as 9U01FF6, another object on a similar orbit discovered on 26 October 2009.|$|E
