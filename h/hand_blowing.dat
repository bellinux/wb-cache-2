50|$|Most of the {{instrument}} is the one originally constructed for this church by Hele & Co of Plymouth in 1894 {{at a cost of}} £750. At that time, the Choir and some slides on the Great and Swell were only “prepared for”. In 1926 it was given a clean and overhaul by Henry Speechly & Sons of London, who also added the Choir stops and soundboard, the reed stops at 16' and 4' on the Swell, 8’ on the Great, and 16’ on the Pedal. They also installed the electric blower to replace the <b>hand</b> <b>blowing</b> apparatus previously used. In 1950, Roger Yates of Michaelstow cleaned all the pipe work, and added the Swell Tremolo, the Pedal 4' Nachthorn, and the pneumatic relay to enable the Pedal Quint to be derived from the Bourdon/Bass Flute rank.|$|E
50|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism in {{the line}} of his profession above and {{beyond the call of duty}} at the risk of his life, as second in command of a Guardia Nacional Patrol on 24 April 1932, engaged, at the time, in active operations in the field against armed bandit forces in the vicinity of Constancia, near Coco River, Department of Jinotega, Northern Nicaragua,. While the patrol was in formation on the trail searching for a bandit group, with which contact had just previously been had, a rifle grenade fell from its carrier, carried by a member of the patrol, and struck a rock, igniting the detonator. Several men of the patrol were in close proximity of the grenade at the time. Corporal Truesdale, who was several yards away at the time, could easily have sought cover and safety for himself but instead, knowing full well the grenade would explode within two or three seconds, and with utter disregard for his own personal safety, and at the risk of his own life, rushed for the grenade, grasped it in his right hand and attempted to throw it away from the patrol before it exploded. The grenade exploded in his <b>hand,</b> <b>blowing</b> it off and inflicting serious multiple wounds about his body. Corporal Truesdale, by his actions, took the full shock of the explosion of the grenade upon himself, thereby saving the lives of, or serious injury to, his comrades in arms. His actions were worthy of the highest traditions of the profession of arms.|$|E

40|$|Eurydice is a {{group of}} three glassworks {{selected}} for the exhibition ‘Glasstress’ at the International Venice Art Biennale 2009 curated by Adriano Berengo, Laura Mattioli Rossi and Rosa Barovier Mentasti. The Eurydice series arose from a body of artworks of more than fifty pieces in glass, commissioned and made at Berengo Studios between 2008 - 2011. The artworks extended the researcher’s methodologies as a fine artist in which the hand craft processes of collage and drawing are the focus of practice-based research. Fluid hot glass production is reliant on the development of strategies or ideas to be interpreted in close collaboration with a master craftsmen, in stark contrast to solo studio practice. In order to maintain the quality of hand drawing the recurring motif of a female figure, a silhouette was hand cut from silver leaf and embedded into molten glass. This represented a very different approach to the conventional use of silver as texture or embellishment. The glassworks realised a unique approach to the material informed not only by studio methodologies but also Venetian glass traditions which included the use of rich colour, Venetian glass beads and <b>hand</b> <b>blowing.</b> The 2009 exhibition reappraised glass as a fine art medium and featured work by 46 twentieth century and contemporary artists including Man Ray, Robert Rauschenberg, Louise Bourgeois, Mona Hatoum and Tony Cragg...|$|E
