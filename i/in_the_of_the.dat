40|$|Abstract: Employing {{the quantum}} Hamiltonian {{describing}} {{the interaction of}} two-mode light (signalidler modes) generated by a nondegenerate parametric oscillator (NDPO) with two uncorrelated squeezed vacuum reservoirs (USVR), we derive the master equation. The corresponding Fokker-Planck equation for the Q-function is then solved employing a propagator method developed by K. Fesseha [J. Math. Phys. 33 2179 (1992) ]. Making use of this Q-function, we calculate the quadrature fluctuations of the optical system. From these results we infer that the signal-idler modes are in squeezed states. When the NDPO operates below threshold we show that, for a large squeezing parameter, a squeezing amounting to a noise suppression approaching 100 % below the vacuum level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quadratures can be achieved. ...|$|E

The rate of the transport between the two fragments is shown to be dependent on the slope of the symmetry energy at saturation density.

40|$|Building {{facilities}} have become important infrastructures for modern productive plants dedicated to services. In this context, the control systems of intelligent buildings have evolved while their reliability has evidently improved. However, {{the occurrence of}} faults is inevitable in systems conceived, constructed and operated by humans. Thus, a practical alternative approach {{is found to be}} very useful to reduce the consequences of faults. Yet, only few publications address intelligent building modeling processes that take into consideration the occurrence of faults and how to manage their consequences. In the light of the foregoing, a procedure is proposed for the modeling of intelligent building control systems, considersing their functional specifications in normal operation and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event of faults. The proposed procedure adopts the concepts of discrete event systems and holons, and explores Petri nets and their extensions so as to represent the structure and operation of control systems for intelligent buildings under normal and abnormal situations.

The new algorithm's rate of convergence depends on a certain geometric parameter of the polytope that extends the above radius but is always positive.
