40|$|Linear {{friction}} welding (LFW) is a solid-state joining {{process that is}} finding increasing interest from industry for the fabrication of titanium alloy (Ti– 6 Al– 4 V) preforms. Currently, {{the effects of the}} workpiece geometry on the thermal fields, material flow and interface contaminant removal during processing are not fully understood. To address this problem, two-dimensional (2 D) computational models were developed using the finite element analysis (FEA) software DEFORM and validated with experiments. A key finding was that the width of the workpieces in the direction of oscillation (in-plane width) had a much greater effect on the <b>experimental</b> <b>weld</b> outputs than the cross-sectional area. According to the validated models, a decrease of the in-plane width increased the burn-off rate whilst decreasing the interface temperature, TMAZ thickness and the burn-off required to remove the interface contaminants from the weld into the flash. Furthermore, the <b>experimental</b> <b>weld</b> interface consisted of a Widmanstätten microstructure, which became finer as the in-plane width was reduced. These findings have significant, practical benefits and may aid industrialisation of the LFW process.

40|$|In the {{literature}} on numerical simulations of Marangoni driven hydrodynamics in laser spot weld pools, it has been proven impossible to obtain good agreement between simulated and experimentally observed weld shapes without artificially enhancing the thermal conductivity and the dynamic viscosity of the liquid steel by one to two orders of magnitude.

Three flux-cored wires with different chemical compositions, marked by DM-I, DM-II and DM-III were used in welding a martensitic steel for the comparison of the microstructures and mechanical properties of the welding metals and HAZ. The results show that DM-I weld metal contains martensite plus other reinforced phases, while both DM-II and DM-III alloys lead to mainly martensitic microstructures with little precipitates.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to verify the {{capability}} of pigmented coatings to mitigate the effects of thermal sensitisation of 430 stainless steel. Design/methodology/approach - <b>Experimental</b> <b>weld</b> joints of non-stabilised ferritic corrosion resistant steel type AISI 430 were prepared. Protective coatings in several variants were applied to a number of weldments, subsequently subject to corrosion tests in SO 2 and NaCl. The anticorrosive efficiency of the coatings was evaluated by means of normative visual assessment and metallographic analysis of the mechanism and depth of corrosion damage. Findings - Anticorrosive efficiency of the tested coatings was experimentally established under conditions where differences were identified in structural changes caused by welding, or resulting from mechanical damage to the coating. Differences in the progress of corrosion damage caused by phase changes in the heat-affected zone were established. Practical implications - Tests of anticorrosive efficiency of coatings of selected types provided information about possible reduction in sensitisation of welded non-stabilised steel. The effect of the investigated processes on degradation of anticorrosive resistance was identified. Originality/value - A specific effect of phase changes accompanying welding on the corrosion mechanism was described and so were the reasons underlying development of corrosion damage at visually identical character of surface damage.

Arc temperature, velocity, current density, heat flux and gas shear are investigated in the arc region and pool convection and puddle shapes are studied in the weld pool region. The arc temperature at the tungsten electrode is found the maximum with sharp tip and decreases as the tip angle increases. The arc temperature on the anode (workpiece) surface becomes concentrated with increase in tip angle. The arc velocity and gas shear stress are observed large with sharp tip and decreasing as the tip angle increases. Current density on the anode surface does not change with tip angle and observed almost the same in all the tip angles in both 2 mm and 5 mm arc lengths. Heat flux due to conduction and convection is observed {{more sensitive to the}} tip angle and decreases as the tip angle increases. The electromagnetic force is slightly observed increasing and the buoyancy force is observed slightly decreasing with increase in tip angle.

The weld pool shape is observed wide and shallow in sharp and narrow and deep in large tip angle. Increasing the arc length does not change the weld pool width; however, the weld pool depth significantly changes with arc length and is observed deep in short arc length.

The main contribution of this thesis is the development of key technologies for life evaluation of dies and moulds after remanufacturing through a thorough review of remanufacture related activities within the die and mould industry. It is proposed that evaluation of remaining service life of dies and moulds after remanufacturing is carried out using finite element modelling. It involves determination of residual stresses induced by repair welding, working conditions for the future operation and life model of die material. Specifically, the thesis is firstly focused on the design of representative die geometry. The geometry is optimized based on the effect of thermal loading and the effect of residual stress due to laser welding. Secondly, fatigue life model was established by conducting thermal fatigue tests and finite element modelling as well. Induction heating based test method was adopted for its capacity of achieving similar thermal shock effects. An energy based life model was derived by taking into account test period.

40|$|Glasses {{have been}} widely used as {{substrates}} in new technologies especially flat panel displays (FPD), organic light-emitting diode (OLED) lighting, and lab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications. They are inexpensive, chemically inert with excellent optical, mechanical and thermal properties. In addition, they are biocompatible, and some compositions possess bioactive properties which are highly desirable in biomedical applications. This dissertation seeks to develop fundamental understanding of feature formation mechanisms and changes in morphology, structural, and mechanical properties of glasses induced by lasers in both high (a femtosecond laser) and low (a continuous wave laser) intensity regimes, and to investigate novel processes for modification and integration of glasses. Due to its nonlinear absorption capability in glasses, a femtosecond laser is used to generate internal features inside glass. Their morphology, structure, and mechanical properties such as modulus, hardness, ductility, and fracture toughness are experimentally characterized. Fundamental understanding of the feature formation and these property changes is developed through differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, spatially resolved Raman spectroscopy, spatially resolved nanoindentation, and predictive numerical simulations. The improved understanding lays ground work to investigate novel processes of transmission welding (TW) and single step channeling (SSC) in glasses. Joining or sealing of glasses in FPD, OLED, and LOC applications are currently based on adhesives. They are susceptible to moisture permeability and require high curing temperatures of entire parts {{for a long period of}} time. TW is investigated and the mechanism of joint formation is analyzed. A numerical model, developed to predict the welding widths, demonstrates the inverse teardrop-shaped absorption volume like the <b>experimental</b> <b>weld</b> seam geometry. Using indentation fracture analysis, the joint is determined to have better mechanical properties than the base material. Fabrication of microfluidic networks in LOC using traditional lithographic processes, or other hybrid processes is cumbersome because they involve multiple steps. SSC is investigated, and numerical models are also developed and experimentally validated to predict the channel lengths resulting from different laser and focusing parameters. The understanding of the channel formation mechanism, and the channel length variation corresponding to the working parameters is developed. TW has the potential to achieve a reliable, highly localized sealing process while SSC has the potential to simplify LOC designs requiring no adhesive for FPD and biomedical industry, respectively. Reduction of the risk of early failure for load-bearing biomedical implants could be achieved by coating bioactive glass onto bioinert metallic substrates. High bioactivity of bioactive glass accelerates the bone-bonding time. Coatings of 45 S 5 Bioglass, which has the highest rate of bioactivity by plasma spraying and enameling usually fail due to its significant crystallization and weak adhesion to the substrates. Double layer coating by a continuous wave (CW) laser is investigated to produce a dense bond coat having a strong adhesion and a porous top coat having high bioactivity. The morphology and microstructure of the resultant laser coatings are experimentally characterized.

40|$|The {{sensitisation}} of a 12 % chromium ferritic stainless steel, {{conforming to}} EN 1. 4003 and available commercially in South Africa under the trade name of 3 CR 12, was investigated {{during the course}} of this project. 3 CR 12 was designed to pass through the (a + g) phase field on cooling, with the austenite transforming to martensite on subsequent cooling to room temperature. The aim of this investigation was to verify that 3 CR 12 can sensitise during continuous cooling after welding, provided that low heat input levels are used. Two grades of 3 CR 12 with slightly different chemistries, designated 41220 (A) and 41311 (B), were evaluated. Grade 41220 has a higher austenite potential than grade 41311. 3 CR 12 plate was joined autogenously to AISI 316 L by means of a series of square butt welds. Gas tungsten arc welding with argon shielding was used, and the heat input was varied from approximately 30 J/mm to 450 J/mm, in conjunction with welding speeds ranging from 2. 36 mm/s to 33. 3 mm/s. Rosenthal’s heat flow equations were used to calculate the cooling rate from 1500 ºC to 800 ºC for each <b>experimental</b> <b>weld,</b> and to illustrate the influence of the effective heat input and welding speed on the martensite content of the high temperature heat-affected zone. An increase in welding speed reduces the heat input and increases the cooling rate after welding. At lower heat input levels (less than approximately 100 J/mm), austenite nucleation was found to be suppressed by the rapid cooling rates, and a continuous network of ferrite-ferrite grain boundaries formed in the high temperature heat-affected zone. Higher heat inputs resulted in slower cooling with more martensite in the high temperature heat-affected zone after cooling. At heat input levels above approximately 250 J/mm, enough martensite formed during cooling to eliminate a continuous network of ferrite-ferrite grain boundaries in the high temperature heat-affected zone. Sensitisation was evaluated using an electrolytic oxalic acid etch (ASTM 763 - 99, Practice W), and a potentiostatic etch in 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4. During the potentiostatic etch test, the potential was maintained at 0 VSCE to reveal the presence of any chromium depleted zones. Both grades of 3 CR 12 were found to be sensitised when a continuous network of ferrite-ferrite grain boundaries was present in the high temperature heat-affected zone (i. e. after welding at low heat input levels). When the heat input during welding was high enough to ensure the presence of martensite on the majority of the heat-affected zone grain boundaries, thereby effectively eliminating continuous ferrite-ferrite grain boundary networks, the welds were not in the sensitised condition. The austenite that forms during cooling acts as a carbon sink, absorbing any excess carbon. This prevents supersaturation of the ferrite and subsequent carbide precipitation that can lead to chromium depletion and sensitisation. Due to its higher austenite potential, grade 41311 can be welded at lower heat input levels and with faster cooling rates than grade 41220 without inducing continuous carbide precipitation and sensitisation. In order to prevent sensitisation, a fusion-line cooling rate of 80 ºC/s should not be exceeded in 3 mm 3 CR 12 plate during welding.

The growing presence of non-conventional stainless steel species like duplex family generates uncertainty about how their material properties could be affected under the welding process. To develop suitable welding numerical models, authors must consider the welding process parameters, geometrical constraints, material nonlinearities and all physical phenomena involved in welding, both thermal and structural.

With high resolution microscopy the microstructure was found to be a mixture of predominantly upper bainite and a coarse grained, previously not documented, constituent characterised to be coalesced bainite in dendrite core regions, with mainly martensite present in interdendritic regions for high manganese weld metals. Manganese reductions were found to promote upper bainite while carbon additions were found to promote martensite. A constitutional diagram was constructed that summarises microstructure as a function of manganese and nickel contents. In Part B o...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{degradation}} of the structural and mechanical parameters of DOMEX 700 MC steel due to welding process. It is focused on evaluation of the mechanical heterogeneities influence at higher strain rate. DOMEX 700 MC presents the microalloyed steel with the increasing utilization mainly for the lightweight construction of the transportation means. The precise characterization of material behavior at high strain rate is of great importance for reliable prediction of welded parts in that application. Evaluation of the local mechanical parameters of <b>experimental</b> <b>welding</b> joints was performed. The three-point instrumented dynamic fracture analyses and instrumented indentation tests were employed to study the elastic-plastic response of critical weldments sublayers. The static vs. dynamic yield strength and energy consumption to fracture was compared in different stages of temper influence. Structural analyses brought {{the information about the}} conducted structural changes in tempered zone. Fractography analyses were focused on evaluation of local differences in fracture behavior influenced by real metallurgy quality. Based on the experimental results, the used combination of loading method is suitable to determine the local mechanical properties and enable the estimation of temper sensitivity of analyzed steel.

40|$|A welding {{procedure}} specification is the document describing how a weld joint should be constructed. Arc weld processes {{are characterized by}} transient thermal behavior, leading to rapid changes in material properties and dynamic interaction between weld and base material. The objective of the project is to explore how {{the use of an}} improved CWM-platform affects representative stress and strain fields in order to assess {{welding procedure}} qualification records. Forthis project, the accumulated thermal and mechanical influences from the first run to the final run are brought forward, in one and the same meshed geometrical model. Both the thermal and mechanical material model of the platform are designed to be used for modelling of the base- and weld material,promoting the simulation of the intricate combination of the thermal, elastic,and plastic strains on the plastic strain hardening and the formation of residual stress fields. The output of the simulation is mainly weld cooling times, residual stresses, and deformations. This analysis is taken further by examining how residual stresses influence crack driving force under elastic and plastic loading. In addition, the output from the simulations can be used to assess the realism of the proposed welding parameters. The main <b>experimental</b> <b>welding</b> procedure examined comes from the IIW RSDP Round Robin Phase II benchmark project, where the main aim was to benchmark residual stress simulations. This work was found to contain many applicable challenges of a CWM-analysis project...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} an {{efficient}} on-line monitoring system focused on the real-time analysis of the welding quality is an active area of research, mainly due to {{the widespread use of}} both arc and laser welding processes in relevant industrial scenarios such as aeronautics or nuclear. In this work, an improvement in the performance of a previously designed monitor system is presented. This improvement is accomplished by the employment of a dual spatial-spectral technique, namely imaging spectroscopy. This technique allows the simultaneous determination of the optical spectrum components and the spatial location of an object in a surface. In this way, the spatially characterization of the plasma emitted during a tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding is performed. The main advantage of this technique is that the spectra of all the points in the line of vision are measured at the same time. Not only are all the spectra captured simultaneously, but they are also processed as a batch, allowing the investigation of the welding quality. Moreover, imaging spectroscopy provides the desired real-time operation. To simultaneously acquire the information of both domains, spectral and spatial, a passive Prism-Grating-Prism (PGP) device can be used. In this paper the plasma spectra is captured during the welding test by means of a near infrared imaging spectroscopic system which consists of input optics, an imaging spectrograph and a monochrome camera. Technique features regarding on-line welding quality monitoring are discussed by means of several <b>experimental</b> <b>welding</b> tests...|$|R
40|$|Finite element (FE) process {{modelling}} of the inertia friction welding (IFW) between two tubular CrMoV components {{has been carried}} out using the DEFORM- 2 D (v 10. 2) software. This model has been validated against <b>experimental</b> test <b>welds</b> of the material; this included process data such as upset and rotational velocity as well as thermal data collected during the process using embedded thermocouples. The as-welded residual stress from the FE model has been compared to experimental measurements taken on the welded component using the hole drilling technique. The effects of the solid-state phase transformations which occur in the steel are considered and the trends in the residual stress measurements were well replicated when compared to the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{is made of}} different submerged arc welding processes, that is ones using singlewire, twin-wire and triple-wire electrodes, applied to welding of two webs consisting of L sections 16 x 90 x 4100 mm in size. <b>Experimental</b> <b>welding,</b> measurement of welding parameters, calculation of the melting rate, measurement and calculation of shielding flux consumption, a visual examination of the welds made, an analysis of macro sections, and an economic calculation of the respective {{total cost of the}} welding processes using single-wire, twin-wire and triple-wire electrodes were performed {{in order to make a}} comparative analysis of the processes concerned. The experimental results obtained showed that high quality welded joints could be produced using two wires or three wires, i. e. the twin- or triple-wire electrode, in a joint contact tube in submerged arc welding. The calculation of the cost-effectiveness of welding, including personnel, materials, overheads and other costs, showed that welding with the twin-wire electrode cuts the costs by 20 % and welding with the triple-wire electrode by around 30 %. Submerged arc welding with a triple-wire electrode is a new welding process variant suitable for thick and long workpieces and in cases where a larger quantity of the molten filler material is required. Three wires in a joint contact tube can be arranged in a line or in the shape of a triangle optionally with long sides depending on the shape of the joint assembly and the weld shape desired. Although this procedure is highly efficient and shows numerous advantages over welding with a single-wire electrode, it has not been established in practice yet...|$|R
