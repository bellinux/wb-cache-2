40|$|It {{is common}} to {{interpret}} rejections of the unit-root null hypothesis {{in favor of a}} trend stationary process with possible trend breaks as evidence that the data are better characterized as stationary about a broken trend. This interpretation is valid only if the model postulated under the alternative hypothesis is the only plausible alternative to the model postulated under the null. We argue that there are economically plausible models that are not well captured under either the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis of these tests. We show that applied researchers who ignore this possibility are likely to reject the unit-root null with high probability in favor of a trend stationary process with possible breaks. Our evidence shows that this potential pitfall is both economically relevant and quantitatively important. We explore the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>applied</b> users may mitigate inferential errors by using finite-sample and bootstrap critical values. ...|$|E
40|$|As the {{economic}} crisis deepens and widens, fears {{of a return to}} the protectionist spiral of the 1930 s become more common. However, an important difference between the 1930 s and today is the existence of the World Trade Organization and the legal limits it imposes on the protectionist responses members can pursue. The objective of this paper is threefold. First, to assess the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>applied</b> tariff can legally be raised without violating tariff-bound obligations, and compare it with what is economically possible. Second, to examine what has been the protectionist response of individual countries when facing an economic crisis since the creation of the WTO. Finally, to predict how far the protectionist responses will go during the current crisis. Results suggest that the policy space left when looking at what is economically possible is indeed quite large. However, in the recent past very little of the available policy space has been used by countries suffering from an economic crisis. Our predictions for the current crisis are modest tariff hikes in the order of 8 percent. International Trade and Trade Rules,Trade Policy,Free Trade,Debt Markets,Access to Finance...|$|E

Learning disorders are often associated with persistent hyperactivity and aggression and {{are part of a}} spectrum of neurode-velopmental disorders. A potential clue to understanding these linked phenomena is that physical exercise and passive forms of stimulation are calming, enhance cognitive functions and learning, and are recommended as complementary treatments for these problems. The theory is proposed that hyperactivity and aggression are intense stimulation-seeking behaviors (SSBs) driven by increased brain retinergic activity, and the stimulation thus obtained activates opposing nitrergic systems which inhibit retinergic activity, induce a state of calm, and enhance cognition and learning. In persons with cognitive deficits and associated behavioral disorders, the retinergic system may be chronically overactivated and the nitrergic system chronically underactivated due to environmental exposures occurring pre- and/or postnatally that affect retinoid metabolism or expression. For such individuals, the intensity of stimulation generated by SSB may be insufficient to activate the inhibitory nitrergic system. A multidisciplinary research program is needed to test the model and, in particular, to determine the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>applied</b> physical treatments can activate the nitrergic system directly, providing the necessary level of intensity of sensory stimulation to substitute for that obtained in maladaptive and harmful ways by SSB, thereby reducing SSB and enhancing cognitive skills and performance. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{decade of}} {{spectacular}} progress in functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) technology and systems neuroscience research has so far yielded few changes in our daily lives. The dearth of clinical applications of this prolific and academically promising research tool began raising the eyebrows of the public and the research funding agencies. This {{may be one of the}} reasons for the enthusiasm and interest paid to the growing body of literature suggesting that blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI of the brain could be sensitive to the differences between lie and truth. The word 2 ̆ 7 differences 2 ̆ 7 is critical here since it refers to the often-ignored core concept of BOLD fMRI: it is only sensitive to differences between two brain states. Thus, available studies report using fMRI to discriminate between lie and truth or some other comparative state rather than to positively identify deception. This nuance is an example of the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>applied</b> neuroscience research does not lend itself to the type of over-simplification that has plagued the interpretation of fMRI-based lie detection by the popular press and the increasingly vocal academic critics. As an early contributor to the modest stream of data on fMRI-based lie detection, I was asked by Dr Aldert Vrij to write a piece in favour of fMRI-based lie detection, to be contrasted with a piece by Dr Sean Spence presenting an opposite point of view (Spence, 2008). This seemingly straightforward task presented two hurdles: having to respond to the popular as well as scientific view of what lie detection with fMRI is and present a wholly positive view of evolving experimental data...|$|E

This paper reports {{the outcome of}} a series of {{interviews}} and focus group meetings with professionals working in post-trade processing and the provision of mutual distributed ledger services. The objective was to elicit and document views on three research hypotheses about the potential impact of mutual distributed ledger technology (‘blockchain’) on post-trade processing global securities markets. These hypotheses are (a) on the appropriate access to mutual distributed ledger; (b) on whether change would be piecemeal or ‘big bang’; and (c) on the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>applying</b> mutual distributed ledger in securities settlement would require major changes in business processes. Our research finds that while the use of blockchain to validate operational data in mutual distributed ledgers can yield substantial reductions in both cost and risk, the concept of data sharing itself is far from new. Current interest in mutual distributed ledgers has established significant momentum, but there is a danger of building unrealistic expectations of the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> the technology on its own will address the underlying need for co-ordination of business processes both within and between firms. Achieving all the potential benefits from mutual distributed ledgers will require board level buy-in to a substantial commitment of time and resource, and active regulatory support for process reform, with relatively little short term payoff...|$|R

40|$|This guide {{provides}} a {{an overview of}} newly introduced offences for unauthorised disclosure of information about ‘special intelligence operations’, how they operate and the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> they <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> public interest disclosures. Introduction The offences for unauthorised disclosure of information about a ‘special intelligence operation’ {{were one of the}} most controversial aspects of the National Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014 (NSLA Bill). The Bill was passed by both Houses of Parliament (with some amendments, including to the offences) and became an Act on 2 October 2014. Debate about the offences was re-ignited when Australian Labor Party front-bencher Anthony Albanese commented on them in an interview on 12 October 2014, in which he suggested they go too far and should be monitored closely. The debate remains relevant in the context of a similar offence relating to delayed notification search warrants proposed in the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014, which is currently before the Senate. These offences are different to longstanding secrecy offences such as the offence in section 70 of the Crimes Act 1914, which criminalises unauthorised disclosure of official information by someone who is or was a Commonwealth officer. They apply more broadly to any person who discloses particular information, raising concerns that they may inappropriately capture legitimate reporting.

At the same time fire and rescue services {{are increasingly}} employing geodemographic classifications in range of operational and strategic tasks. Geodemographic classifications {{have been used in}} a number of applications to characterise areas based on their social circumstances and are multi-dimensional by design; in contrast census derived measures tend to be uni-dimensional, measuring social or material deprivation on a scale of high to low albeit derived as a composite of contributing factors.

Specifically trends in fire incidence are compared with both census-derived data and small area geodemographic classifications in order to assess the value of such classifications as exploratory tools in investigating potential associations with socio-economic patterns. These findings are couched in terms of wider debates regarding the use of neighbourhood classifications in adequately capturing what are often complex patterns in fire incident patterns in relation to such factors as community cohesion and social capital. This in turn highlights the need for more research to explore how geodemographic classifications can be used to provide a contextual basis for detailed analysis of local patterns of fire incidents...|$|R
