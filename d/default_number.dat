25|$|Regardless of {{the playoff}} format, {{the top six}} teams had {{qualified}} for the following season's Heineken Cup in {{the final years of}} that competition, and since 2013–14 a minimum of six teams qualify for the European Rugby Champions Cup. Before the 2009–10 season, the seventh-place team also qualified if a French club advanced farther in that season's Heineken Cup than any team from England or Italy. While the European qualification system was changed for 2009–10, the normal contingent of six Top 14 teams in the Heineken Cup did not change. The <b>default</b> <b>number</b> of French teams in the Champions Cup has remained at six, but the method for a seventh French team to qualify has changed from performance in the previous European season to a post-season playoff. For the inaugural Champions Cup in 2014–15, this playoff involved the seventh-place teams from both England and the Top 14; in future years, the same two sides will be joined by one Pro12 side.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we test {{the effect of}} {{non-binding}} defaults {{on the level of}} contribution to a public good. We manipulate the <b>default</b> <b>numbers</b> appearing on the decision screen to nudge subjects toward a free-rider strategy or a perfect conditional cooperator strategy. Our results show {{that the vast majority of}} our subjects did not adopt the <b>default</b> <b>numbers,</b> but their stated strategy was affected by the default. Moreover, we find that our manipulation spilled over to a subsequent repeated public goods game where default was not manipulated. Here we found that subjects who previously saw the free rider default were significantly less cooperative than those who saw the perfect conditional cooperator default...|$|R

50|$|A {{downside}} of this single-threaded {{approach is that}} Node.js doesn't allow vertical scaling by {{increasing the number of}} CPU cores of the machine it is running on without using an additional module, such as cluster, StrongLoop Process Manager or pm2.

50|$|The {{compromise}} solution that was eventually found and developed into Unicode was {{to break the}} assumption (dating back to telegraph codes) that each character should always directly correspond to a particular sequence of bits. Instead, characters would first be mapped to a universal intermediate representation {{in the form of}} abstract numbers called code points. Code points would then be represented {{in a variety of ways}} and with various <b>default</b> <b>numbers</b> of bits per character (code units) depending on context. To encode code points higher than the length of the code unit, such as above 256 for 8-bit units, the solution was to implement variable-width encodings where an escape sequence would signal that subsequent bits should be parsed as a higher code point.|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} of each round, all factions roll for initiative. The <b>default</b> <b>number</b> of dice which factions roll is uniform, but by {{expending}} resources, players can increase the number of dice rolled for that turn, increasing the odds that they win the roll. Not only does the initiative control the order of turns, but it also controls how many action points the faction gets. However, if players invest too many resources to win the roll, they may be limited in what they can actually do during their turn, having depleted their supplies. The game requires players to prioritize their limited assets, since there are rarely enough to address all needs.|$|E

This number includes teams that participated but were later suspended (Lebanon and Panama), and excludes hosts Spain, which still participated in qualifying matches, and the United States, which qualified automatically and no longer participated in qualifying matches.|$|E

50|$|Almost {{every play}} mode in Legends (except for special event stages) {{requires}} {{a certain number}} of pizza points to play. The player's <b>default</b> <b>number</b> of pizza points increases based on the player's overall level. Higher levels allow more pizza points upon starting out. Pizza points are displayed in the top left corner of the screen and are represented by a slice of pepperoni pizza. Easier stages require fewer pizza points (usually six or eight), while harder stages require the player to spend larger amounts (anywhere from twelve to sixteen points). The player can replenish their pizza points either by visiting the pizza shop or by waiting and allowing the pizza points to slowly refill on their own. Pizza points can also be obtained from some of the game's prize wheels.|$|E

In most existing such algorithms, {{the size of the}} patches is either fixed and specified by a <b>default</b> <b>number</b> or simply chosen to be inversely proportional to the spatial frequency. However, it is noted that the patch size affects how well the filled patch captures the local characteristics of the source image and thus the final completion accuracy. Thus in this paper we propose a new method to compute appropriate patch sizes for image completion to improve its performance. In particular, we formulate the patch size determination as an optimization problem that minimizes an objective function involving image gradients and distinct and homogenous features. Experimental results show that our method can provide a significant enhancement to patch-based image completion algorithms. <br /...|$|E

Some publishers stick with the <b>default</b> <b>numbering</b> of the tool they are using, which is typically to number {{the first page of}} the front matter as one and all pages after that in a consecutive order. When publishers wish to distinguish between the front matter and the story, the initial title pages are not numbered, the front matter is numbered using small Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, etc.) and the first page of the story or main content begins with one. The title page of the story is not numbered, but if a story is broken into multiple parts (Part I, Part II, etc.), the title page for the section may be included in the numbering but not shown on the page. The first page of Chapter One would then be numbered as page three rather than page one as would be the normal case.|$|R
