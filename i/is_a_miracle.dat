Editor Stuart Baird reflected, [...] "Filming was finished in October 1978 and it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> we had the film released two months later. Big-budgeted films today tend to take six to eight months." [...] Donner, for his part, wished that he had [...] "had another six months; I would have perfected a lot of things.

500|$|The general {{critical}} reception was warmly enthusiastic. Felix Aprahamian in The Sunday Times {{called the}} performance [...] "a curiously moving spiritual and musical experience". Eric Roseberry, writing in Tempo magazine, found the music [...] "simple and memorably tuneful throughout... the writing for strings, recorders and percussion <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> of inspiration". Andrew Porter in Opera magazine [...] {{also found the}} music touched [...] "by high inspiration"; the evening was [...] "an unforgettable experience... extraordinarily beautiful, vivid and charming, and often deeply moving". The design and production, Porter reported, were [...] "brilliant", while Mackerras commanded his disparate forces masterfully. Several critics remarked favourably on {{the sound of the}} handbells. The Timess critic noted the effectiveness of Britten's setting of the mystery play: [...] "It is Britten's triumph that in this musically slender piece he has brought to new life the mentality of another century by wholly modern means. These means included a miscellaneous orchestra such as he alone could conceive and handle".|$|E

In his 2002 lookback, Roger Ebert noted with surprise that the film had [...] "an instant familiarity" [...] despite its age, and Slant writer Jaime N.

A later Guardian critic, Peter Bradshaw, named it the best comedy film of all time, commenting that [...] "this wonderfully funny, unbearably sad film <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> of comic writing and inspired film-making". John Marriott of the Radio Times believed that Annie Hall was the film where Allen [...] "found his own singular voice, a voice that echoes across events with a mixture of exuberance and introspection", referring to the [...] "comic delight" [...] derived from the [...] "spirited playing of Diane Keaton as the kooky innocent from the Midwest, and Woody himself as the fumbling New York neurotic". Empire magazine rated the movie five out of five stars, calling it a [...] "classic". At Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 8.9 out of 10. The site's consensus reads [...] "Filled with poignant performances and devastating humor, Annie Hall represents a quantum leap for Woody Allen and remains an American classic".|$|E

[...] Despite being more interested in the romantic aspirations of the show's characters, Jennifer Godwin of E! remarked that [...] "the Lost mythology <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> to behold.

In 1993 Scorpia stated that it [...] "comes off rather poorly", criticizing the [...] "atrocious combat system" [...] and economy. She concluded that the game [...] "is only for the devoted MegaTraveller fan with a high tolerance for exasperation". In 1996 the magazine's editorial staff listed MegaTraveller 1 as the fourth worst game of all time and [...] "easily the Mega-worst role-playing experience of all time." [...] They wrote that the plot [...] "felt tossed off...from rehashes of pen and paper modules that [...] had designed in the past." [...] Amiga Format also expressed disappointment with the game's plot. Its reviewer wrote that the player's effort is largely directed towards earning money and that the [...] "main plot consists of about six conversations, swapping a few items, and blowing away Kiefer Konrad." ...|$|E
