5|$|<b>Fracture</b> <b>toughness</b> is {{measured}} using a notched and pre-cracked rectangular specimen, {{of which the}} dimensions are specified in standards, for example ASTM E23. There are other means of estimating or measuring <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness</b> by the following: The Charpy impact test per ASTM A370; The crack-tip opening displacement (CTOD) test per BS 7448-1; The J integral test per ASTM E1820; The Pellini drop-weight test per ASTM E208.|$|E
5|$|A {{reduction}} in <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness</b> {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness</b> is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E
5|$|Ductility is an {{important}} factor in ensuring the integrity of structures by enabling them to sustain local stress concentrations without fracture. In addition, structures are required to be of an acceptable strength, which is related to a material's yield strength. In general, as the yield strength of a material increases, there is a corresponding reduction in <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness.</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>fracture</b> <b>toughnesses</b> of two carbon-carbon {{composites}} and ATJ-S graphite {{were determined}} from the load-deflection responses of single-edge-notched specimens subjected to three-point bending. The resistance to crack initiation {{in the presence}} of a pre-existing flaw (machined notch) was examined using the linear elastic fracture mechanics parameters of critical stress intensity factor Kc, and critical strain energy release rate Gc. The resistance of the materials to both crack initiation and propagation was determined using the work-of-fracture parameter &gamma;F.

With specimens of in-plane dimensions sufficient for measuring valid <b>fracture</b> <b>toughnesses</b> KIc the specimen thickness is varied {{over a large}} range. Compared to the “dog-bone ” model the results show characteristic differences: The crack tip plastic zones near to or at the specimen surface do in general {{not agree with the}} usual results of 2 D plane stress calculations. Furthermore, for specimen thicknesses well above the usual minimum thickness the crack tip plastic zones have not decayed yet to the size of 2 D plane strain calculations.

However, none of these projects resulted in a production quantity, mainly because of its low impact resistance and its low <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness.</b>|$|E

It is helpful to evaluate the serviceability, performance and long term clinical success of biomaterials. It is reported that the high <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness</b> material improved clinical performance and reliability as compare to low <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness.</b> It can be measured by many methods e.g. indentation fracture, indentation strength, single edge notched beam, single edge pre cracked beam and double cantilever beam.|$|E
25|$|Crystalline {{minerals}} {{formed in}} the physiological environment often show exceptional physical properties (e.g., strength, hardness, <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness)</b> and tend to form hierarchical structures that exhibit microstructural order over a range of scales.

40|$|We adopt a {{recently}} developed technique, dynamic semicircular bend testing, {{to measure the}} <b>fracture</b> initiation <b>toughness,</b> <b>fracture</b> propagation <b>toughness,</b> and <b>fracture</b> velocity of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). A modified split Hopkinson pressure bar system is used to apply the dynamic load. In this method, both the <b>fracture</b> initiation <b>toughness</b> and <b>fracture</b> energy, and thus the average <b>fracture</b> prop-agation <b>toughness,</b> are determined. The initiation toughness {{is found to be}} similar to the propagation toughness, and both toughnesses are loading rate-dependent. Our initiation toughness values for PMMA are in accord with those reported in the independent literature. The fracture velocity increases and then becomes saturated as the propagation toughness increases. We also measure the fracture surface rough-ness of the recovered fragments. While the surface roughness increases with the fracture energy, the increase of surface area alone is not sufficient to accommodate the increase in fracture energy, suggesting other energy dissipation mechanisms in the dynamic fracture process besides free surface creation. 1...|$|R

25|$|The first type is mold erosion, {{which is}} the wearing away of the mold as the liquid metal fills the mold. This type of defect usually only occurs in sand {{castings}} because most other casting processes have more robust molds. The castings produced have rough spots and excess material. The molding sand becomes incorporated into the casting metal and decreases the ductility, fatigue strength, and <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness</b> of the casting. This {{can be caused by}} a sand with too little strength or a pouring velocity that is too fast. The pouring velocity can be reduced by redesigning the gating system to use larger runners or multiple gates. A related source of defects are drops, in which part of the molding sand from the cope drops into the casting while it is still a liquid. This also occurs when the mold is not properly rammed.|$|E

500|$|The {{first major}} {{application}} of [...] was abrasive and cutting tools. Bulk, monolithic silicon nitride {{is used as}} a material for cutting tools, due to its hardness, thermal stability, and resistance to wear. It is especially recommended for high speed machining of cast iron. Hot hardness, <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness</b> and thermal shock resistance mean that sintered silicon nitride can cut cast iron, hard steel and nickel based alloys with surface speeds up to 25 times quicker than those obtained with conventional materials such as tungsten carbide. The use of [...] cutting tools has had a dramatic effect on manufacturing output. For example, face milling of gray cast iron with silicon nitride inserts doubled the cutting speed, increased tool life from one part to six parts per edge, and reduced the average cost of inserts by 50%, as compared to traditional tungsten carbide tools.|$|E
2500|$|The {{biomaterial}} term is {{used for}} materials {{that can be used}} in biomedical and clinical applications. They are bioactive and biocompatible in nature.

This includes dental replacement and bone joining or replacement for medical and clinical application. Therefore their mechanical properties are very important. Mechanical properties of some biomaterials and bone are summarized in table 1. Among them hydroxyapatite is most widely studied bioactive and biocompatible material. However, it has lower young’s modulus and <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness</b> with brittle nature. Hence, it is required to produce a biomaterial with good mechanical properties.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{approach}} {{was to develop}} a polymeric matrix which involved both a reactive liquid healing agent and a catalyst. [...] While undamaged, these were kept structurally separate. The liquid agent was contained inside non-reactive reservoirs within the material, while the catalyst was dispersed throughout the polymer. [...] Once the material was damaged and a crack occurred, the reservoirs broke open, and capillary action caused the liquid agent to disperse into the damaged area, where it reacted with the catalyst and solidified to seal the crack. [...] They have studied both the use of a contained healing agent and a dispersed catalyst, and the use of a dispersed healing agent and a contained catalyst.

50|$|Just as {{the elastic}} {{properties}} of materials, like elastic moduli and strength, vary among material class, so too does the <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness.</b> Figure.1 graphs the <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness</b> vs. strength for various materials and materials classes. However, unlike most elastic properties, <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness</b> displays a wide variation across materials, about 4 orders of magnitude. As can be expected, metals hold the highest values of <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness.</b> Since cracks cannot easily propagate in tough materials, this makes metals highly resistant to cracking under stress and gives their stress-strain curve a large zone of plastic flow. Comparatively, engineering ceramics {{have a lower}} <b>fracture</b> <b>toughness,</b> which leads to ease of cracking, but show an exceptional improvement in the stress fracture that is attributed to their 1.5 orders of magnitude strength increase, relative to metals.

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} study of the mechanical/electrical fracture behavior of dielectric materials, piezoelectric ceramics PZT 8, PZT 4, and polymeric material poly vinyl chloride (PVC), was made in this work. The charge-free zone (CFZ) model proposed by Zhang et al. {{for the failure of}} conductive cracks in dielectrics, which was well verified by the experimental results of depoled piezoelectric ceramics PZT 4, was extended to predict the failure behavior of conductive cracks in piezoelectric ceramics. Piezoelectric ceramics were treated as mechanically brittle and electrically ductile materials in the charge-free zone model. The failure criterion, developed from the CFZ model, for conductive cracks in piezoelectric ceramics under mechanical and/or electrical loading has an elliptic shape in terms of the normalized electric intensity factor and the normalized stress intensity factor. To verify the theoretical prediction from the CFZ model for piezoelectric ceramics, experiment was conducted to study the failure behavior of electrically conductive cracks (deep notches) in poled lead zirconate titanate PZT- 8 ceramics. When the critical stress intensity factor was normalized by the critical stress intensity factor under purely mechanical loading and the critical electric intensity factor was normalized by the critical electric intensity factor under purely electric loading, the experimental results revealed that the failure behavior of the conductive cracks in the ceramics was described by an elliptic function of the normalized electric intensity factor versus the normalized stress intensity factor under combined mechanical and electric loading. The experimental results verified well the theoretical predictions from the CFZ model. The relationship between strain (deformation) and electric field (voltage) is linear when electric filed (voltage) is low. The relationship becomes nonlinear at high electric field (voltage). In order to adopt the linear constitutive equations which have simple forms, and to cover the actual applying procedure at the same time, a novel concept of secant piezoelectric constant was introduced to refine the CFZ model. In addition, the concepts of fracture mechanics, which were successfully applied in the study of poled PZT 4, PZT 8 and depoled PZT 4, were introduced to study the electrical failure behavior of polymeric material poly vinyl chloride (PVC). Two kinds of samples, compact tensile (CT) samples and the double notched samples, were used to obtain the electrical <b>fracture</b> <b>toughnesses.</b> The electrical <b>fracture</b> <b>toughnesses</b> obtained from CT samples were higher than those obtained from the double notched samples. This showed that for polymers, electrical <b>fracture</b> <b>toughnesses</b> were not only related to the tested materials, but also related to the conditions of how the notch tips were electrically biased...|$|R
