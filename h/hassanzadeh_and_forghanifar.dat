For this purpose, we construct and study, using a recent article of <b>Hassanzadeh</b> <b>and</b> the second named author, a family of complexes that contains important informations on a residual intersection and its canonical module. We also determine several invariants of residual intersections as the graded canonical module, the Hilbert series, the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and the type. Finally, whenever I is strongly Cohen-Macaulay, we show duality results for residual intersections that are closely connected to results by Eisenbud and Ulrich. It establishes some tight relations between the Hilbert series of some symmetric powers of I/a. We also provide closed formulas for the types and for the Bass numbers of some symmetric powers of I/a.

Despite significant amount of research, there is no consensus on whether the infill walls play beneficial or disadvantageous role in vulnerability of structures (Pujol and Fick 2010). Some of the researches have presented the beneficial effects of infill walls on seismic performance of structures (Murty and Jain 2000).

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{knowledge}} about how frost-damage affects the behaviour of concrete structures {{has been developed}} and presently some related studies can be found. It has been generally proved in all tests and analyses carried out since now, that when concrete is severely damaged by freezing, a reduction of the load-carrying capacity and stiffness of the structure and a possible change of the failure mode are detected. Due to {{the change in the}} micro and macro structure of concrete, the material properties of frost-damaged concrete may not be the same as for undamaged concrete. The aim of this master thesis is to study the influence of frost-damage on reinforced concrete beams and to analyse the mechanical behaviour of the beams. Material and bond properties of frost-damaged specimens have been tested by Zandi Hanjari (2008). The results from these experiments were used to choose the input data for non-linear analysis of twelve beams, with different geometries and reinforcement content. Six beams were analysed with undamaged concrete properties and the other six with damaged concrete properties, in order to study the effect of frost-damage on the beams. The stress-strain and bond-slip curves, the Young’s modulus of elasticity and the fracture energy were introduced in the analyses for both undamaged and damaged concrete. Results from experiments on the same frost-damaged reinforced concrete beams, performed by <b>Hassanzadeh</b> <b>and</b> Fagerlund (2006), were compared with the numerical results. Moreover, the results obtained in this thesis were compared with previous analyses, carried out by Zandi Hanjari et al. (2008). The numerical results of this thesis underestimate the stiffness and the strength of large beams with crushing failure. This {{may be due to the}} fact that all the finite elements were considered to be as damaged as the outer part of concrete. While in reality, the level of damage is not constantly distributed along the cross section; that is the closer it is to the surface of concrete, the more damaged it would be. On the other hand, for small beams with crushing failure, which are believed to be more damaged than the larger ones, the same assumption led to an overestimation of the loadcarrying capacity. In general, the numerical results carried out with new input data showed a general improvement when predicting the deformations and load capacities of the beams. The failure modes were also well predicted and the shape of the force-deformation curves appeared to be fairly better fitted with new input data analyses. To sum-up, the experimental research on material properties for frost-damaged concrete seems to have been really helpful to better predict the mechanical behaviour of the tested damaged beams...|$|R
3000|$|Azom and Javadpour (2012) used a {{modified}} pseudo-pressure approach and obtained an adequate matrix–fracture shape factor for interporosity gas flow. They presented a two-dimensional implicit dual-continuum reservoir simulator for naturally fractured reservoirs with single-phase compositional setting. However, implementing the model required implementing a numerical simulation. Sureshjani et al. (2012) derived explicit rate-time solution of single-phase interporosity gas flow assuming quasi-steady-state flow for dual-porosity system. In the derivation, they approximated pseudo-time to time when integrating outflow from matrix block, and moreover, μ_i c_i/μ c≈([...] p/Z)/ [...]. - 0 pt([...] p/Z)_i is assumed. Ranjbar <b>and</b> <b>Hassanzadeh</b> (2011) developed semi-analytical solutions for nonlinear diffusion equation in gas-bearing reservoir before back-calculating matrix–fracture shape factor with the developed solution. However, the solutions contain two unknown parameters determined by matching data generated by numerical simulator for corresponding matrix and fluid type.|$|R
30|$|Dennis et al. (2010) {{stated that}} the {{physical}} structure properties and complexity of fracture characterization both {{have a significant effect}} on fluid flow in fractured rock. Thus, they proposed that the fracture zone should be characterized fully before simulation. Wang et al. (2016) studied the flow stress damage and reservoir responses to injection rate under different DFN-connected configuration states. Their results proved significant influence of the hydraulic pressure flow on the properties of hydraulic fractures. Generally, Gan and Elsworth (2016) stated that in any fracture modeling for complex reservoirs, the upcoming assumptions should not be neglected: Fractures initiate from flaws and the process is controlled by the elastic stress around them, the material surrounding the flaws can be viewed as continuum media, and individual flaws are spaced widely enough so that stress anomalies associated with each do not overlap. These assumptions are necessary for analytical formulation and therefore will be retained in the analysis, although a slight degree of plasticity is allowed (Wang and Shahvali 2016). However, in any elastic gridding, it should be kept in mind that a fracture is initiated when the maximum stress concentration occurring on the critical flaw boundary reaches the strength of the material which surrounds the flaw. Fracture extension also occurs from the tensile and not the compressive stress concentrations under both tensile and compressive loading. Fan et al. (2012) stated that microcracks induced by the excess oil/gas pressure may propagate and form an interconnected fracture network. This indicates also that during production, different pressure regimes could change characteristics of fractures. Not only might they be closed in the case of pressure drop or reservoir depletion, but they also might be widened due to high production rates and excessive pressure of fluid flow to the walls of fractures or cracks. It also might create fractures which make connections between vugs, while cracks could be widened and/or become fractures. Fan et al. (2012) investigated mechanism of fracture propagation by a linear elastic model. They have shown that critical crack propagation takes place if the intensity of the induced stress reaches the fracture toughness of the reservoir rock. On the other hand, subcritical crack propagation occurs in the rock when the stress intensity has not reached the fracture toughness of the reservoir rock, but exceeds a threshold value, which is usually a fraction (e.g., 20 %– 50 %) of fracture toughness of the reservoir rock. This conclusion states how important it is to consider fracture–matrix interaction and/or boundary condition of fractures in accurate flow simulation. Subsequently, <b>Hassanzadeh</b> <b>and</b> Pooladi-Darvish (2006) considered the time variability of the fracture boundary condition by the Laplace domain analytical solutions of the diffusivity equation for different geometries of fractures in constant fracture pressure through a large number of pressure steps. Guerriero et al. (2013) proposed an analytical model that could pave the way to a full numerical model allowing one to calculate the pore pressure within fractures, at several scales of observation, in a reasonable time. They also suggested that the model also allows one to obtain a better understanding of the hydraulic behavior of fractured porous rock. However, not only the pressure regime change, but other factors affecting fracture shape and apertures could be accounted for by considering elastic behavior of fractures in the model construction during gridding and throughout production history matching investigation.|$|R
40|$|The {{sedimentary}} and biotic {{evolution of}} a 190 m interval of shallow marine and lagoonal facies in the Bellerophon and Werfen formations in the Southern Alps has allowed comparison of western with eastern Tethys: Meishan D section (southern China), Salt Range (Pakistan) and Abadeh (Iran). Results are as follows: (1) The {{upper part of the}} Bellerophon Fm. (Changhsingian changxingensis-deflecta Zone) shows only modest biotic variation connected with tectonically driven local variation and perhaps to more general climatic variation. The δ 13 C decrease starting in the uppermost 30 m of the Bellerophon Fm. is correlated with decrease in global organic productivity starting about 1 m below the PTB in Chinese sequences and 20 m below in the Abadeh section. This interval culminated in a regression truncated by an unconformity-paraconformity (Unconformity 1). (2) The uppermost Bellerophon Fm. is a ca. 1 m transgressive-regressive sedimentary cycle, the informally named Bulla Mbr (Changhsingian: Early praeparvus Zone). The maximum flooding interval of this unit possibly had a slight increase in biodiversity, mainly in foraminifers, algae and brachiopods. The high increase in biodiversity previously reported may, in part, reflect abundance of biota and organic matter reworked into transgressive and regressive intervals. We suggest partial correlation of the basal unconformity of the Bulla Mbr (Unconformity 1) with the regressive uppermost Bed 24 e of the Meishan D section marking the disappearance of foraminifers and algae in the eastern Tethys. We also suggest diachronous disappearance of benthic taxa in Tethys, with the Southern Alps acting like a refugium. (3) The main extinction (first extinction phase, mainly regarding foraminifers) in the Southern Alps occurred in a thin ca. 25 cm interval including the uppermost regressive Bulla Mbr, Unconformity 2, and possibly, the basal transgressive bed of the Tesero Mbr of the Werfen Fm. This interval is correlated in part with regressive Bed 26 of Meishan D section. The main decrease in abundance and biodiversity in the Southern Alps coincides with appearance of small oolites with crystalline outer cortex near the basal transgressive tract of the lower Tesero Mbr, a ca. 220 cm sedimentary cycle, that is followed by extension of microbialitic layers alternating with veritable biostromes with brachiopods and byssate bivalves as salient components among the algae. Vacated niches favored evolution of conodonts. Hindeodid conodont biodiversity increased with species developing characteristics of Isarcicella. This interval has been referred to the Changhsingian Late praeparvus Zone and correlated with Bed 27 a-b of Meishan D section. The PTB has been identified in the Bulla section at 1. 30 m {{from the base of the}} Werfen Fm. - with the first appearance of Hindeodus parvus defining the base of the parvus Zone - in a microbialitic layer correlated with Bed 27 c of Meishan D section. Around the PTB the major part of the remaining Permian biota disappeared. Gymnocodiacean algae were the last group to undergo extinction within the Triassic layers. (4) Biodiversity dropped severely in the succeeding bioturbated microbialitic interval from which conodonts are absent. More humid climate is reflected in a more sandy marine substrate inhabited by Lingula, Unionites and Claraia. Conodonts recurred in the schizohaline upper part. The succeeding entry of the biozonal markers Isarcicella lobata, Isarcicella staeschei and Isarcicella isarcica allow discrimination of three conodont biozones. The layer with entry of I. staeschei has been aligned with Bed 28 of Meishan D section. The main extinction phase in the western Tethys seems to correspond to a gradual but swift transition from acid-bath to alkaline bath according to the Deev Jahi model of Heydari <b>and</b> <b>Hassanzadeh</b> [Heydari, E. <b>and</b> <b>Hassanzadeh,</b> J., 2003.

30|$|During {{the past}} decades, several {{researches}} {{have concentrated on}} the performance of steel built-up batten columns due to axial loads (Hosseini Hashemi and Jafari 2009, 2012). Following the Bam earthquake of 2003 in south-eastern Iran, several steel structures were damaged (Eshghi et al. 2003). Failure of the built-up batten columns {{was one of the most}} observable failure modes in damaged buildings (Hosseini Hashemi and Jafari 2004; Hosseinzadeh 2004). In most of these studies, the behavior of the batten columns due to gravitational loads was investigated. In other words, most of the researchers neglected the effect of the lateral loads on the behavior of steel batten columns (Hosseini Hashemi and Jafari 2004). Following the Bam earthquake, some studies were conducted to investigate the behavior of batten columns due to the earthquake. Razzaghi et al. (2010) investigated the performance of built-up batten columns due to axial and cyclic lateral loads. The results of this study revealed that laterally loaded batten columns had extremely unstable behaviors in the post-buckling region. It was also shown that existing code provisions are not sufficient for seismic design of batten columns. Furthermore, Hosseini Hashemi <b>and</b> <b>Hassanzadeh</b> (2008) studied the performance of the damaged steel building with batten columns due to the Bam earthquake.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results from}} numerical and analytical analyses of concrete structures {{as well as}} results from laboratory tests. Numerical methods based on the finite element method and fracture mechanics are used. The thesis comprises five papers and a general introductory part. The five papers deal with the following topics: Material properties for concrete at low temperatures, Paper A: This paper presents results from {{an investigation of the}} fatigue strength and the fracture energy of water saturated unreinforced concrete. The tests were carried out both at room temperature and under cold conditions. The experiments show that the load bearing capacity of water saturated specimens is strongly affected of low temperatures. The water in the pores freezes and generates a load bearing ice skeleton. The compressive and splitting strength of the concrete will as a result increase. Also the fracture energy increases at low temperatures. Both the absolute and the relative fatigue strength increase for water saturated concrete. Bond properties of concrete, Paper B: The paper discusses the influence of splitting failure on the bond properties of deformed reinforcement bars. Laboratory tests with normal and high strength concrete are presented. The tests were designed to obtain a high degree of confinement with the intention to establish the upper limit of the bond strength. The bond strength has been normalized with regard to the concrete splitting strength. The high strength concrete has a higher normalized bond strength than the normal strength concrete for bar diameters of 8 and 16 mm. A theoretical model, based on fracture mechanics, is presented. The model gives relationships between the pressure generated by the mechanical interaction and the length of the splitting cracks. Modelling of concrete shaft in a gravity based offshore structure. Influence of hydraulic pressure on fracture mechanics parameters, Paper C: The paper describes an analysis carried out in order to predict the risk of concrete delamination in the shaft of the Draugen Gravity Based Structure (GBS) platform situated in the northern Atlantic. The analysis formed part of an independent verification of the platform by VERITEC in Norway and was performed using a nonlinear finite element program (DIANA) with a material model based on fracture mechanics. The analysis shows that there was no risk of progressive cracking or delamination in the shaft of the studied gravity based offshore structure. Modelling of mixed mode fracture, Paper E: This paper describes numerical modelling of fracture formation under combined tensile and shear loading. The numerical model used is based on the Inner Softening Band Approach, see Klisinski et al. (1991). The results are compared with test results presented in <b>Hassanzadeh</b> (1992) <b>and</b> Nooru-Mohamed (1992). The model reproduces crack pattern and nominal stress displacement curves. The compressive stresses due to dilation can also be modelled. The stress rotations are generally small. In the final stage of the test, the stress rotation increases in some elements, especially in the smallest elements, so that more cracks should be introduced in each element in order to avoid interlocking effects. Anchor bolts in concrete, Papers D and E: The first paper [D] presents results from anchor bolt tests, comprising both plane and axisymmetric specimens. Different design formulas are discussed. Results from finite element analyses are presented. The second paper [E] presents analyses and tests on a plane anchor bolt specimen. The analyses are based on the Inner Softening Band Approach, see Klisinski et al. (1991). The analysis reproduces deformations at maximum load and crack pattern at an early stage of the test. Peak loads are overestimated. The post peak behaviour is not properly captured due to stress interlocking even before the peak load is reached. The possibility to introduce more then one crack in an element seems to be an essential step for further development of the analysis. Godkänd; 1995; 20070426 (ysko...|$|R
