50|$|The case {{involved}} {{the charter of}} a ship for two years’ consecutive voyages between US and Europe. The ship was to be loaded at a specified rate. The owners were to be paid according {{to the number of}} voyages made during the two-year period. If the time taken for loading and unloading was longer than required, the charterers were to pay $1000 per <b>day</b> by way <b>of</b> <b>demurrage.</b> The charterers were taking many extra days in loading and unloading but were allowed to continue to have the use of the ship {{for the remainder of the}} two years. Eight round trips were made. However, the owners alleged that the charterers delay in loading and unloading had made a further six trips impossible and sued for damages. The owners claimed that they were not bound by that clause because the charterers by their extraordinary delays had committed a fundamental breach of the contract.|$|R

50|$|The rate <b>of</b> <b>demurrage</b> (if any) is {{generally}} accepted as {{the measure of}} the damages for detention, but is not necessarily the true measure. When the claim is for detention and not demurrage the actual loss is recoverable, which may be more or may be less than the agreed rate <b>of</b> <b>demurrage.</b> The contract usually doesn't count Sundays and holidays as lay days—but unless expressly stipulated, this exception does not apply after the lay days have expired.|$|R

50|$|In other cases, if {{the vessel}} is {{detained}} beyond the fixed number <b>of</b> <b>demurrage</b> <b>days,</b> the ship owner can recover damages for detention.

50|$|Some {{complementary}} currencies {{take advantage}} <b>of</b> <b>demurrage</b> fees, an intentional {{devaluation of the}} currency over time, like negative interest. This stimulates market exchanges in the devaluating currency, propagates new participation in the currency system and forces the storage of wealth (hoarding) ability usually reserved for currency into more permanent and better value holding tools like property, improvement, education, technology, health, equity securities, etc. - {{all of which are}} sheltered from the currency-based demurrage fees.|$|R
50|$|Unlike inflation, {{demurrage}} gradually reduces {{only the}} value of currency held: it functions as a negative interest (a tax) on currency held versus inflation that also reduces {{the value of}} savings or retirement funds and increases CPI. A positive interest rate is a subsidy. Both inflation and demurrage reduce the purchasing power of money held over time, but demurrage does so through fixed regular fees, while inflation does it {{in a variety of}} ways. Inflation is certainly not always everywhere a monetary phenomenon. Inflation is not always easy to predict & it does not stay fixed through time, but the level <b>of</b> <b>demurrage</b> is fixed by the Government.|$|R

50|$|Demurrage-charged local {{currency}} was successfully {{tested in the}} Austrian town of Wörgl between 1932 and 1934, as a tax collected {{for the benefit of}} the unemployed, until the Austrian central bank stopped the experiment. Similarly, in 1936, the Social Credit Party-led government in Alberta, Canada, introduced prosperity certificates in an attempt to alleviate the effects of the Great Depression, with holders having to affix to the back of a certificate a 1-cent stamp before the end of every week, for the certificate to maintain its validity. Local scrip systems, many <b>of</b> which incorporated <b>demurrage</b> fees, were also used across the United States during the Great Depression, and the Bankhead-Pettengill bill of 17 February 1933 was introduced in Congress to institutionalize such a system at the national level under the US Treasury, as documented in Irving Fisher's book Stamp Scrip. Bernard Lietaer also documents in his book Mysterium Geld the use <b>of</b> <b>demurrage</b> currency systems in Europe's High Middle Ages' bracteate systems and ancient Egypt's ostraka - dated receipts for the storage of grain - and credits these currency systems with the prosperity of those societies.|$|R
50|$|In principle, {{it can be}} {{considered}} that the similarity between vessel demurrage and container demurrage is correct since both refer to the same concept, which is the late return of equipment supplied by one party to another {{for the purpose of}} carrying a cargo.

40|$|Bulk {{commodity}} export terminals {{are equipped}} with very expensive infrastructure. The massive capital outlay also is accompanied by large operating costs associated with major equipment such as shiploaders, reclaimers, and unloading stations. The port management is always interested in optimizing the deployment of its infrastructure {{with a view to}} minimizing the terminal's operating costs. This study deals with finding an optimal solution to an interesting situation where using one shiploader results in unacceptable ship waiting times and a high level <b>of</b> <b>demurrage,</b> whereas continuous deployment of two shiploaders results in inefficiency and high operating costs. This paper describes an approach for developing a strategy that considers a trade-off between the ship waiting cost and the cost of deploying the additional shiploader and results in the optimal deployment of resources. The approach is an integration of simulation, scenario building, and economic fundamentals. An actual bulk export terminal in Australia is used to demonstrate the applicability of this approach in assisting the port management in rational decision making...|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} of trouble is taken, by {{draftsman}} of voyage charterparties, to apportion risks of delay between owners and charterers at loading and discharge. Care must be taken over the commencement of laytime, {{the circumstances in which}} notice of readiness can be tendered, and exceptions and interruptions to laytime and <b>demurrage.</b> The complexities <b>of</b> <b>demurrage</b> alone have been judicially described as 'hideous': and no doubt the same sentiments can equally apply to laytime. This careful apportionment of delay risk can be entirely upset if the delay occurs before laytime is triggered. If charterers are held to have committed a breach of an independent term, preventing the laytime from running, damages will be for detention and neither layime nor demurrage provisions will be triggered. Charterers will lose the benefit of their laytime, and neither side will enjoy the convenience of the liquidated damages provided by the demurrage regime. This article considers two problems in this regard which could arise from recent decisions of the courts; first, the widening of safe port and safe berth obligations to encompass delay, and secondly, the implication of such terms into charterparties. Whatever view may be taken of these developments generally, neither is desirable in the contect of careful risk apportionment. To date, the courts have to some extent embraced the first, while fortunately restricting the second...|$|R

The Research methodology concerned about data collection where the researcher was applying systematic approaches in data collection so as come up with the specific findings. The researcher used both qualitative and quantitative methods to find the challenges behind ineffective customs clearance activities of sea port consignments. The study used 33 respondents using purposive and convenience sampling techniques, and methods of data collection (primary data and secondary data) as tables were drawn by used special program known as SPSS. The findings revealed that, among major challenges come as the results of clearance procedures in Tanzania being too long, surrounded with corruption environment due to multiple documentation requirements, and the procedures are neither transparent enough nor documented. At MSD, it was revealed that there is small number of clearing staffs compared to the tasks and the long payment procedures were some source of the problems. Basing on the findings, it was recommended that, MSD should increase the number of clearing staffs and should consider using pre-payment procedures by depositing amount of money in advance to ease clearing process...|$|R

40|$|Australia's {{reputation}} {{for the quality}} of its coal has led to this commodity becoming a major input to the country's economy. About 88 million tonnes out of Australia's annual port capacity of 270 million tonnes of coal are shipped through the Port of Newcastle, which claims to be the world's largest coal handling port. However, capacity constraints at various parts of the supply chain threaten export shipments of coal. In the past demand for coal has been regular and constant. However, recent rapid increases in demand, attributed mainly to an increasing Chinese market, have pushed the existing system beyond its capacity. An outcome of the inability of the coal supply chain to meet demand has been the increasing number of vessels waiting to enter the port. In 2002, the number of vessels anchored off the port often exceeded 50 daily. In an attempt to reduce vessel waiting time, and the burgeoning cost <b>of</b> <b>demurrage,</b> a vessel priority system for loading was introduced. The system appeared to be effective, with the daily number of vessels anchored off the port reducing to single figures. However, in 2007 the number of vessels awaiting entry to the port has again risen to more than 50 on most days, leading to cuts in export quotas [1]. Exacerbating the situation are orders for coal totaling 120 million tonnes for shipment in 2008. This ongoing research, initially based on newspaper reports and ACCC documents, is a qualitative exploratory case study that investigates the issues affecting the transportation, loading and shipment of coal through the Port of Newcastle, Australia. The research aims to identify why so many ships are waiting to load coal, and how the length of the queue may be reduced. However, reports widely circulated do not accurately reflect the situation at the Port. Following unstructured, formal interviews involving several key people in the coal supply chain a different story has emerged.
