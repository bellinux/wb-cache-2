40|$|In 2005 {{a survey}} was {{conducted}} in the main citrusgrowing areas of Epirus. Commercial groves and nurseries were inspected for symptoms of virus and viruslike diseases {{and a total of}} 123 samples were collected. Molecular hybridisation was used to test for Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), Citrus psorosis virus (CPsV), Citrus infectious variegation virus (CVV), Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) and Hop stunt viroid (HSVd). Although the results are from a low number of samples, they give a significant insight into the sanitary conditions of the Greek citrus industry, disclosing the presence of CTV mild strains in the North-western area. Key words: citrus, virus diseases, CTV, molecular hybridisation, sequencing. Citrus is an ancient crop in Greece, where it is grown in 29 of the 54 prefectures of the country. Sweet orange is the dominant species, followed by lemon, mandarin and grapefruit, all grafted primarily onto sour orange (Kyriakopoulou, 2002). With about 3. 5 millions trees, the Arta valley is the main citrus-growing area of Epirus. Most of the virus and virus-like diseases of citrus occur in Greece, e. g. psorosis A and B, concave gum, <b>impietratura,</b> cristacortis, crinkly leaf, ringspot, exocortis, cachexia, gummy bark and sour orange woody gall (Kyriakopoulou, 2002). Surveys for Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) were started in Greece in 1995 and large-scale testing was carried out by DAS-ELISA and direct tissue blot immunoassay (DTBIA). In June 2000, CTV was detected {{for the first time in}} Argolis (North East Peloponnese) and in Chania (Crete), due to the accidental introduction of CTV-infected budwood from Spain (Dimou et al., 2002). We now report the results of a survey for virus and virus-like diseases affecting citrus in some areas of Epirus...|$|E
