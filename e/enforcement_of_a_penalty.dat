If time elapses between the contract period and the enforcement period, a credit constrained agent that uses the proceeds of trade to fund consumption faces a greater cost to enforce a contract than an unconstrained agent. This allows the other party to a contract to hold up the credit constrained agent, thereby creating inefficiency. This is demonstrated for two types <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> mechanisms; <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> one-time trade via the courts, and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long-term trade via a punishment strategy. ...|$|R
