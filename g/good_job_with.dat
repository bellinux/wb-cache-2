His partner Glen Morgan had a similar opinion, calling it [...] "a little too ordinary, like you have seen it before, which is exactly what the network wanted at the time. Chris Carter had a more positive view of the episode, calling it [...] "very well done, really great effects, and more of a meat-and-potatoes kind of story. An FBI sting and a good mystery that Mulder and Scully investigate. Overall, a really solid episode."

The other is the “peripheral” sector of bad <b>jobs</b> <b>with</b> bad working conditions, low advancement opportunities and little job safety. Mobility between these two groups is very difficult.

[...] At Atlantic, he attempted to incorporate this style and influence with his cover of country singer Hank Snow's [...] "I'm Movin' On". Charles later said about the song, [...] "When I heard Hank Snow sing 'Moving On', I loved it. And the lyrics. Keep in mind, I’m a singer, so I like lyrics.

500|$|Exiles {{graphics}} and sound received nearly universal praise, and were credited with completing the game's immersion. The puzzles {{were described as}} less difficult and more contained, meaning that players {{did not have to}} experiment with switches and then click several screens away to see the effect, as in Riven. Macworlds Peter Cohen praised Presto for giving out bits of story throughout the game, rather than providing exposition only during opening and closing sequences. The pacing and rewards system was also appreciated by reviewers. IGN concluded their review of the game by stating that Presto had done [...] "a pretty <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>with</b> a notable addition to the series". The Daily Telegraph offered even stronger praise, saying that Presto had crafted the best Myst game in the series thus far, a sentiment that was echoed in other publications. The editors of Computer Games Magazine named Exile the best adventure game of 2001, and called it [...] "a breath of fresh air amidst the otherwise barren crop of adventure titles."

Flandez was not as pleased by Kurt—or by the Warblers, who he said had ruined the song—and likened his performance to [...] "Jar Jar Binks on acid, with those jerky moves and infantile facial expressions". Roberts called their version [...] "hokey", and Slezak said the setting [...] "felt contrived as heck" [...] and gave the song a [...] "D". Benigno was {{at the other end}} of the scale with an [...] "A" [...] grade and the summary that [...] "they completely crush it", while Gonzalez gave the number an [...] "A+", deemed it [...] "unforgettable", praised the [...] "unique song selection" [...] and called it [...] "pure fun". Futterman described the Warblers as [...] "the loosest they've been all season", but characterized the performance as one of their [...] "least successful" [...] because Blaine and Kurt, [...] "two of the series' most reliable lead singers", were severely overprocessed electronically. Tyler Glenn, lead singer of Neon Trees, said, [...] "I thought it was cool".|$|E

Recent research indicates that in the United States, at least, a wife's education has {{a positive effect on}} a husband's earning capacity - a focused instance of the economic benefits of association. Even if education did not get women jobs or improve their ability to function as housewives and mothers, it is not wasted. In Israel, however, the authors found that the wife's educational level increased a husband's earnings in the primary sector (in which workers have <b>good</b> <b>jobs,</b> <b>with</b> <b>good</b> pay, security, and fringe benefits) but not in the secondary sector (in which workers have low paying, unstable, generally unattractive jobs).

[...] In particular, the film appeals to college students who have asked Chase to talk about it at film classes.

[...] Chase has said that this film is his favorite to date because [...] "it allowed me to be myself. Fletch was the first one with me really winging it.

[...] Perhaps the most meaningful praise comes from Mcdonald himself: [...] "I watched it recently, and I think Chevy and Michael Ritchie did a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] The film was voted as the 23rd best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of Los Angeles Times writers and editors with two criteria: [...] "The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list."
