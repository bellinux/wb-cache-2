40|$|Background: Fluoropyrimidines {{remain the}} {{cornerstone}} of several regimens for solid malignancies, despite their administration may result in severe or fatal toxicities. Objective: To review pharmacokinetic markers predictive of fluoropyrimidine- associated toxicities. Shifting from i. v. boluses to both continuous infusions of 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) and oral prodrugs, as well as capecitabine, significantly increased the treatment tolerability. However, a variable percentage of patients still suffer from toxic effects that require the delay of next chemotherapeutic cycles, their <b>definitive</b> <b>discontinuation,</b> or urgent life support because of life-threatening adverse reactions. Methods: Appropriate and pertinent articles were retrieved through PubMed search. Results: Fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicities are mainly due to a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase enzymatic deficiency, leading to a reduced excretion of the drug, its increased activation and increased toxic effects against healthy tissues. Among the pharmacokinetic tests, test doses of 5 -FU, uracil and thymine have been evaluated in clinical trials, {{as well as the}} measurement of uracil (U) and dihydrouracil (UH 2) plasma concentrations. The therapeutic monitoring of 5 -FU concentrations during i. v. infusions is another tool to optimize drug dosage before the occurrence of toxicities. Advances in technical platforms, as well as chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, have simplified the implementation of those tests in clinical routine. Conclusion: Several studies have demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} predict the occurrence of severe toxicities from fluoropyrimidines, and the review will discuss all those pharmacokinetic approaches...|$|E
40|$|Deferasirox (DSX) is the {{principal}} option currently available for iron-chelation-therapy (ICT), principally {{in the management of}} myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), while in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) the expertise is limited. We analyzed our experience in 10 PMF with transfusion-dependent anemia, treated with DSX from September 2010 to December 2013. The median dose tolerated of DSX was 750 mg/day (10 mg/kg/day), with 3 transient interruption of treatment for drug-related adverse events (AEs) and 3 <b>definitive</b> <b>discontinuation</b> for grade 3 / 4 AEs. According to IWG 2006 criteria, erythroid responses with DSX were observed in 4 / 10 patients (40 %), 2 of them (20 %) obtaining transfusion independence. Absolute changes in median serum ferritin levels (Delta ferritin) were greater in hematologic responder (HR) compared with non-responder (NR)  patients, already at 6 months of ICT respect to baseline. Our preliminary data open new insights regarding the benefit of ICT not only in MDS, but also in PMF with the possibility to obtain an erythroid response, overall in 40 % of patients. HR patients receiving DSX seem to have a better survival and a lower incidence of leukemic transformation (PMF-BP). Delta ferritin evaluation at 6 months could represent a significant predictor for a different survival and PMF-BP.  However, the tolerability of the drug seems to be lower compared to MDS, both in terms of lower median tolerated dose and for higher frequency of discontinuation for AEs. The biological mechanism of action of DSX in chronic myeloproliferative setting through an independent NF-κB inhibition could be involved, but further investigations are required...|$|E
40|$|Non disponible / Not availableOBJECTIVE : To {{retrospectively}} {{evaluate the}} tolerance and the prognostic {{factors associated with}} better outcome in patients treated with sorafenib for advanced or refractory/relapsing intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in real-life clinical practice, including the specific influence of visceral fat area (VFA). METHODS : 68 HCC patients treated with sorafenib and followed in Hepato-gastroenterology department of Nancy Universitary Hospital from 2007 to 2012 were enrolled. VFA was retrospectively measured on one cross-sectional scan obtained at the umbilicus on CT scan performed within 1 year prior to sorafenib initiation. Tumour response was retrospectively evaluated according to mRECIST criteria. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were determined. Safety data were collected. RESULTS: Median OS was 12. 0 months and median PFS was 3. 0 months. In multivariate analysis, a PS > 1, the presence of vascular invasion and high ASAT baseline levels {{were significantly associated with}} shorter OS (HR respectively of 2. 41, 2. 43 and 1. 51). PS > 1, high ASAT baseline levels and a Child-Pugh score > B 7 were independent predictive factors of shorter PFS (HR respectively of 1. 51, 1. 4 and 1. 47). Semi-quantitative prognostic scores for OS and PFS were determined. Half of patients presented adverse events leading to <b>definitive</b> <b>discontinuation</b> of sorafenib. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea (33. 5 %), fatigue (30. 9 %) and hand-foot syndrome reaction (23. 5 %). CONCLUSION : No impact of VFA on survival was identified. The developed semiquantitative prognostic scores could be useful to identify HCC patients who could take the most advantage from sorafenib therap...|$|E
40|$|Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have {{dramatically}} improved {{the outcome of}} renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients. The use of these agents requires early and appropriate management of side effects such as hematologic adverse events (HAE), {{in order to avoid}} unnecessary dose reductions and transitory or <b>definitive</b> treatment <b>discontinuations.</b> Beyond the increased infective risk, myelosuppression contributes to TKI-related fatigue, thus reducing both patients' quality of life and overall survival (OS). However, the frequency and severity of myelosuppression vary among sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib and axitinib, based on their different kinase selectivity. Their activity against fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT 3 or CD 135) and c-kit, which are essential for survival and differentiation of hemopoietic progenitor cells, is critical to determine the hematologic toxicity profiles. This review describes the molecular mechanisms underlying the TKI effects exerted on hematopoiesis and immune response and related recent patents, of drugs already approved or still under evaluation in RCC, highlighting the potential impact of these effects on tumor response to treatment...|$|R
40|$|Rituximab is an {{effective}} treatment for CD 20 [*]+[*]B-cell malignancies and autoimmune disorders. However, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) may occur after rituximab infusion, causing, in rare cases, its discontinuation. In this multicenter, retrospective study, among 374 patients treated with rituximab i. v., 23. 5 % experienced ADRs. Mean follow-up was 20. 6 months (range 8 - 135). Overall, ADRs were significantly more frequent in non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemias (25 - 35. 9 %), than in autoimmune diseases (9. 4 - 17. 5 %) (p[*]<[*]. 0001). Grade 3 - 4 toxicity was observed in eight patients (2. 1 %), and in four of them (1 % of all patients) <b>definitive</b> drug <b>discontinuation</b> was necessary. Interestingly, three groups of patients with different risk of developing ADR were identified, according to a predictive heat-map developed combining four parameters (splenomegaly, history of allergy, hemoglobin levels and gender) selected by multivariate analysis. This model {{may be useful in}} identifying patients at higher risk of ADRs, needing appropriate preventing therapies...|$|R
40|$|Ruxolitinib is {{a potent}} Janus kinase (JAK) 1 /JAK 2 {{inhibitor}} that has demonstrated rapid reductions in splenomegaly and marked improvement in disease-related symptoms {{and quality of life}} in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). The present analysis reports the 3 -year follow-up (median, 151 weeks) of the efficacy and safety of Controlled Myelofibrosis Study With Oral Janus-associated Kinase (JAK) Inhibitor Treatment-II (the COMFORT-II Trial), comparing ruxolitinib with the best available therapy (BAT) in 219 patients with intermediate- 2 and high-risk MF. In the ruxolitinib arm, with continued therapy, spleen volume reductions of ≥ 35 % by magnetic resonance imaging (equivalent to approximately 50 % reduction by palpation) were sustained for at least 144 weeks, with the probability of 50 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 36 - 63) among patients achieving such degree of response. At the time of this analysis, 45 % of the patients randomized to ruxolitinib remained on treatment. Ruxolitinib continues to be well tolerated. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were the main toxicities, but they were generally manageable, improved over time, and rarely led to treatment discontinuation (1 % and 3. 6 % of patients, respectively). No single nonhematologic adverse event led to <b>definitive</b> ruxolitinib <b>discontinuation</b> in more than 1 patient. Additionally, patients randomized to ruxolitinib showed longer overall survival than those randomized to BAT (hazard ratio, 0. 48; 95 % CI, 0. 28 - 0. 85; log-rank test, P =. 009) ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Anti-tumor {{necrosis}} factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) {{agents are}} generally well tolerated, yet {{they can be}} associated with serious adverse events (SAEs) in a minority of patients. We examined the incidence of SAEs in a pediatric referral center for chronic rheumatologic and gastroenterological inflammatory disorders. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of SAEs occurring during treatment with anti-TNF-α agents in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (n = 78) or pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (n = 105) seen at the Institute for Maternal and Child Health IRCCS "Burlo Garofolo" in Trieste, Italy, between June 2001 and February 2016. Only SAEs grade 3 - 5 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. 03 and/or requiring <b>definitive</b> therapy <b>discontinuation</b> were reported. RESULTS: Total anti-TNF-α exposure was 390. 5 patient-years (PYs). The overall incidence rate of SAEs for etanercept was 4. 14 / 100 PYs. Four patients developed uveitis, two had anxiety disorders, one had a serious zoster infection, and one developed TNF-α antagonist-induced lupus-like syndrome (TAILS). The overall incidence rate of SAEs for infliximab was 22. 49 / 100 PYs. The most common SAEs were anaphylactoid reactions (n = 18), followed by infectious events (n = 9) and TAILS (n = 3). The overall incidence rate of SAEs for adalimumab was 4. 71 / 100 PYs (two infectious SAEs). No malignancies or deaths were observed. A greater incidence rate of infectious SAEs was observed in IBD patients receiving infliximab compared to JIA patients receiving etanercept (8. 11 vs 0. 52 per 100 PYs). CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF-α therapy was generally well tolerated. SAEs leading to anti-TNF-α discontinuation were rare and non-fatal. Infliximab was associated with the highest incidence of SAEs. Infectious SAEs were more frequently observed in IBD patients treated with infliximab than in JIA patients receiving etanercept...|$|R
40|$|There is {{insufficient}} {{evidence to support}} visceral leishmaniasis (VL) treatment recommendations in Brazil and an urgent need to improve current treatments. Drug combinations may be an option. A multicenter, randomized, open label, controlled trial was conducted in five sites in Brazil to evaluate efficacy and safety of (i) amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmphoB) (1 mg/kg/day for 14 days), (ii) liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB) (3 mg/kg/day for 7 days) and (iii) a combination of LAMB (10 mg/kg single dose) plus meglumine antimoniate (MA) (20 mg Sb+ 5 /kg/day for 10 days), compared to (iv) standard treatment with MA (20 mg Sb+ 5 /kg/day for 20 days). Patients, aged 6 months to 50 years, with confirmed VL and without HIV infection {{were enrolled in the}} study. Primary efficacy endpoint was clinical cure at 6 months. A planned efficacy and safety interim analysis led to trial interruption. 378 patients were randomized to the four treatment arms: MA (n = 112), AmphoB (n = 45), LAMB (n = 109), or LAMB plus MA (n = 112). A high toxicity of AmphoB prompted an unplanned interim safety analysis and this treatment arm was dropped. Per intention-to-treat protocol final analyses of the remaining 332 patients show cure rates at 6 months of 77. 5 % for MA, 87. 2 % for LAMB, and 83. 9 % for LAMB plus MA, without statistically significant differences between the experimental arms and comparator (LAMB: 9. 7 %; CI 95 % - 0. 28 to 19. 68, p = 0. 06; LAMB plus MA: 6. 4 %; CI 95 % - 3. 93 to 16. 73; p = 0. 222). LAMB monotherapy was safer than MA regarding frequency of treatment-related adverse events (AE) (p = 0. 045), proportion of patients presenting at least one severe AE (p = 0. 029), and the proportion of AEs resulting in <b>definitive</b> treatment <b>discontinuation</b> (p = 0. 003). Due to lower toxicity and acceptable efficacy, LAMB would be a more suitable first line treatment for VL than standard treatment. ClinicalTrials. gov identification number: NCT 01310738.
