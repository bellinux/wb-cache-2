40|$|This chapter will {{consider}} the ethical issues of consumer behaviour, and frame them in relation {{to one of the}} key challenges of travel and tourism of our current times: the fact that travel causes both positive and negative impacts at the same time, and that all travel and tourism decisions are subject to trade-offs. The first section sets up the chapter by reviewing ethical theory, defining <b>ethical</b> consumption <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> consumerism, <b>and</b> outlining the nature of the <b>ethical</b> business <b>and</b> the <b>ethical</b> consumer, as a brief overview of <b>ethical</b> theory <b>and</b> an introduction to the ethical dilemma. The second section reviews the role of society’s different actors in ethically responsible behaviour and outlines reasons for co-operative systems failing to meet a shared responsibility. This includes definitions of <b>ethical</b> consumption <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> consumerism (which provide the context in which <b>ethical</b> businesses <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> consumers exist in), followed by an overview of <b>ethical</b> business activities <b>and</b> the <b>ethical</b> consumer. The final section provides an overview of <b>ethical</b> tourism <b>and</b> of the <b>ethical</b> tourist <b>and</b> determines the barriers to change which impede responsible consumer behaviour, with particular regard to climate change and tourism...|$|R
40|$|The {{organisational}} {{practice of}} social <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> auditing is commonly {{seen as an}} advancement towards ethical business in that it enhances the moral treatment of organisational stakeholders. In effect, social <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> auditing is the practice of measuring and reporting social performance through engagement with stakeholders. The AA 1000 framework provides an internationally recognised standard for social <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> auditing. However, despite the positive assumption that social <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> auditing is ethical, questions exist. Both the practice of social <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> auditing <b>and</b> the gestalt of social <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> auditing are ripe for ethical exploration.

5|$|Commentators {{attributed}} the mismanagement behind Enron’s fall {{to a variety}} of <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> political-economic causes. Ethical explanations centered on executive greed and hubris, a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation ethics, and get-it-done business pragmatism. Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight. A more libertarian analysis maintained that Enron’s collapse resulted from the company’s reliance on political lobbying, rent-seeking, and the gaming of regulations.|$|E

5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, {{although}} a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed.

While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> social issues.|$|E
5|$|Of these precepts, Mahavira is most {{remembered in}} the Indian traditions for his teachings of ahimsa (non-injury) {{as the supreme}} <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> moral virtue.

According to Mahatma Gandhi, Mahāvīra was the greatest authority on Ahimsa.|$|E
5|$|Other {{texts that}} include Krishna {{such as the}} Bhagavad Gita have {{attracted}} numerous bhasya (commentaries) in the Hindu traditions.

It allegorically raises through Krishna and Arjuna the <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> moral dilemmas of human life, then presents a spectrum of answers, weighing in on the ideological questions on human freedoms, choices, and responsibilities towards self and towards others. This Krishna dialogue has attracted numerous interpretations, from being a metaphor of inner human struggle teaching non-violence, to being a metaphor of outer human struggle teaching a rejection of quietism to persecution.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Rome, the key {{challenge}} to the Empire was to maintain a set of relations between itself and its neighbours. When these nations set about forging formal political institutions, they often modelled themselves on Constantinople. Byzantine diplomacy soon managed to draw its neighbours into a network of international and inter-state relations. This network revolved around treaty making, and included the welcoming of the new ruler into the family of kings, and the assimilation of Byzantine social attitudes, values and institutions. Whereas classical writers are fond of making <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> legal distinctions between peace and war, Byzantines regarded diplomacy {{as a form of}} war by other means. For example, a Bulgarian threat could be countered by providing money to the Kievan Rus'.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Disraeli adopted one-nation {{conservatism}} {{for both}} <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> electoral reasons. Before he became {{leader of the}} Conservative Party, Disraeli had announced that, {{as a result of}} the Reform Act 1867 which had enfranchised the male working-class, the party needed to pursue social reforms if it were to have electoral success. One-nationism would both improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists. Because the party portrayed itself as a national (and not class-based) party, it's members were unsure whether to make specific appeals to the working-classes. A more positive approach to the working-class by the party developed later out of the electoral necessity to secure working-class votes.|$|E
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the possibility of}} auditing students' ethical judgment being affected by two factors, namely <b>ethical</b> orientation <b>and</b> gender. While tests revealed that more idealistic students judged some unethical situations more strictly than did less idealistic students, overall no significant relationship was found between <b>ethical</b> orientation <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> judgment. The study also reported no significant relationship between gender <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> judgment. Furthermore, males were as likely as females to be classified as high idealists.

5|$|By September 1767, all {{but four}} Jesuits {{had left the}} Chiquitania, and they went the {{following}} April. The Spanish considered it essential to maintain the settlements as a buffer against Portuguese expansion. The archbishop of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Francisco Ramón Herboso, established {{a new system of}} government, very similar to that set up by the Jesuits. He stipulated that each mission be run by two secular (parish) priests, one {{to take care of the}} spiritual needs while the other was in charge of all other – political and economic – affairs of the mission administration. One change was that the Indians were allowed to trade. In practice, the shortage of clergy and the low quality of those appointed by the bishop – almost all of whom did not speak the language of the local peoples and in some cases had not been ordained – led to a rapid general decline of the missions. The priests also broke <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> religious codes, appropriated the major part of the missions' income and encouraged contraband trade with the Portuguese.|$|E
5|$|From 1945 to 1947, {{eighteen}} human {{test subjects}} were injected with plutonium without informed consent. The tests {{were used to}} create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body {{in order to develop}} safety standards for working with plutonium. Ebb Cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of Plutonium on 10 April 1945 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge. Other experiments directed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project continued into the 1970s. The Plutonium Files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors. The episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the Hippocratic Oath.|$|E
5|$|Loitering munitions {{that are}} capable of making {{autonomous}} attack decisions (man out of the loop) raise moral, <b>ethical,</b> <b>and</b> international humanitarian law concerns because a human being is not involved in making the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may lock-on after launch or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous loitering munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set a precedent for an aerial system (though not necessarily a precedent when comparing to a modern naval mine) in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{relationship}} between ethical leadership, <b>ethical</b> climate <b>and</b> whistle blowing intention. The data used are primary data and selection of samples is based on a convenience sampling method. Data were collected randomly through questionnaire from 300 shopping mall’s visitors within Cyberjaya and Putrajaya. The findings indicated that there was a significant positive relationship exists between <b>ethical</b> leadership <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> climate; a positive relationship exists between <b>ethical</b> leadership <b>and</b> whistle blowing intention; and a positive relationship exists between <b>ethical</b> climate <b>and</b> whistle blowing intention. The results showed that the critical role of leaders play in creating an <b>ethical</b> climate <b>and</b> ultimately reducing the level of misconduct among their employees, thus reducing the intention of whistleblowing. This implies that a good ethical leadership will reduce the intention of whistleblowing as managers create a better ethical climate...|$|R

5|$|Track {{and field}} athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain {{substances}} by governing bodies for the sport, {{from the national}} to the international level. The IAAF's constitution incorporates the World Anti-Doping Code among other anti-doping measures. Practices such as blood doping {{and the use of}} anabolic steroids, peptide hormones, stimulants, or diuretics can give athletes a physical competitive advantage in track and field. The use of such substances in track and field is opposed on both <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> medical grounds. Given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes' performances, performance-enhancing substances create an uneven playing field — athletes who do not use doping substances have a disadvantage over rivals who do. Medically, the use of banned substances may have an adverse effect upon athletes' health. However, some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned substances for therapeutic use, and athletes are not sanctioned for usage in these cases, such as Kim Collins' failed drug test due to asthma medication.|$|E
5|$|Population {{studies from}} the mid-20th century onwards show topical {{fluoride}} reduces dental caries. This was first {{attributed to the}} conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis, opposition still exists on <b>ethical</b> <b>and</b> safety grounds. The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, foams, and varnishes.|$|E
