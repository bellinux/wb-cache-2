40|$|The six enzymes of the mevalonate pathway of isopentenyl {{diphosphate}} biosynthesis represent {{potential for}} addressing a pressing human health concern, {{the development of}} antibiotics against resistant strains of the Gram-positive streptococci. We previously characterized the first four of the mevalonate pathway enzymes of Enterococcus faecalis, and here characterize the fifth, phosphomevalonate kinase (E. C. 2. 7. 4. 2). E. faecalis genomic DNA and the polymerase chain reaction were used to clone DNA thought to encode phosphomevalonate kinase into pET 28 b(+). Double-stranded DNA sequencing verified the sequence of the recombinant gene. The encoded N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein was expressed in Escherichia coli with induction by isopropylthiogalactoside and purified by Ni++ affinity chromatography, yield 20 mg protein per liter. Analysis of the purified protein by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry established it as E. faecalis phosphomevalonate kinase. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that the kinase exists in solution primarily as a dimer. Assay for phosphomevalonate kinase activity used pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase to couple the formation of ADP to the oxidation of NADH. Optimal activity occurred at pH 8. 0 and at 37 °C. The activation energy was ~ 5. 6 kcal/mol. Activity with Mn++, the preferred cation, was optimal at about 4 mM. Relative rates using different phosphoryl donors were 100 (ATP), 3. 6 (GTP), 1. 6 (TTP), and 0. 4 (CTP). Km values were 0. 17 mM for ATP and 0. 19 mM for (R,S) - 5 -phosphomevalonate.

To circumvent this difficulty, while still taking advantage of the immobilization of biomolecules, site-specific immobilization of the biomolecule with the active (or binding) site directed away from the membrane is essential. In this review, we summarize our efforts involving biophysical and bioanalytical chemistry and chemical engineering, together with molecular biology, to develop and characterize such site-specifically membrane immobilized catalytic <b>enzyme</b> <b>bioreactors.</b> Site-directed mutagenesis, gene fusion technology, and post-translational modification methods are employed to effectuate the site-specific membrane immobilization.

We investigated the cellulolytic system of P. cinnabarinus, {{focusing on the}} involvement of CDH in the deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass. Results First, P. cinnabarinus growth conditions were optimized for CDH production. Following growth under cellulolytic conditions, the main components secreted were cellulases, xylanases and CDH. To investigate the contribution of P. cinnabarinus secretome in saccharification processes, the Trichoderma reesei enzymatic cocktail was supplemented with the P. cinnabarinus secretome. A significant enhancement of the degradation of wheat straw was observed with (i) {{the production of a}} large amount of gluconic acid, (ii) increased hemicellulose degradation, and (iii) increased overall degradation of the lignocellulosic material.

40|$|Lignocellulosic {{biomass is a}} massive, but largely unexploited {{potential}} source of biofuel. The underutilization of this resource stems largely {{from the fact that}} cellulose is difficult to digest into smaller, useable sugar units. Natural lignocellulosic biomass is primarily degraded by fungi, which use Family 1 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) to target cellulose for degradation. Family 1 CBMs are glycosylated, but the effects of glycosylation on CBM function remain unknown. Here, the effects of O-mannosylation of the Family 1 CBM from the Trichoderma reesei Family 7 cellobiohydrolase (TrCel 7 A) are investigated at three glycosylation sites, Thr- 1, Ser- 3 and Ser- 14. The work was made possible by the development of a convenient one-pot synthetic procedure for glycosylated Family 1 CBMs. A library of 20 CBM glycoforms was synthesized with mono-, di-, or tri-saccharides at each glycosylation site. The binding affinity, proteolytic stability, and thermostability of each synthetic glycoform was systematically studied. The results show that even though CBM mannosylation does not induce significant changes to the protein’s secondary structure, it can increase the thermolysin cleavage resistance up to 50 -fold. Fungi are known to excrete several proteases along with CBM-bearing cellulases, so improved proteolytic stability may improve cellulose digestion efficiency by reducing CBM degradation. O-mannosylation was also shown to increases the thermostability of CBM glycoforms up to 16 °C, and a mannose disaccharide at Ser 3 has the largest themostabilizing effect. Thermostability is an important property of industrial <b>enzymes</b> because <b>bioreactors</b> are often operated at elevated temperatures. In the binding affinity tests, the glycoforms with small glycans at each site displayed the highest binding affinities for crystalline cellulose, and the glycoform with a single mannose at each of the three positions had the highest binding affinity; a 7. 4 fold increase compared to the unglycosyalted CBM. High CBM binding affinity has been linked to increased cellulose digestion rate by fungal cellulases, so these results may have important implications in biofuels production. This study demonstrated how chemical synthesis can be used to systematically study glycosylation and lead to the identification of two CBM glycoforms with particularly desirable stability and binding properties...|$|R
40|$|Pollution of soils, sediments and {{especially}} ground- and surface water {{by a wide}} variety of chemicals, including emerging micropollutants necessitates the development of new, powerful strategies of mitigation, restoration and sustainable environmental protection. Micropollutants such as endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDC) represent an increasing concern which is only partially addressed by the use of physicochemical nonspecific approaches such as ozonation. An attractive and ‘greener’ alternative is the use of enzymatic biocatalysis for the removal and detoxification of micropollutants. In addition to the ease and reliability of enzyme usage, the biocatalytic properties of enzymes can be manipulated thanks to protein engineering, <b>enzyme</b> immobilization and <b>bioreactor</b> design. The ligninolytic enzymes of white-rot fungi (WRF) such as peroxidases and laccases are particularly suited to the degradation of micropollutants such as EDC, pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Thanks to their relatively low substrate specificity, these oxidoreductases can oxidize various micropollutants of phenol-like structure plus several non-phenolic substrates indirectly via the oxidized form of mediator molecules. The re-usability of enzymes and their separability from reactants and products is ensured by support-based immobilization or by formation of cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEA). These techniques are illustrated by several new technical developments facilitating enzyme retention in reactor systems. Although of high interest for biotechnological applications, reported CLEA conversion efficiencies for oxidative enzymes are still far from fulfilling these needs. Thus, we have identified relevant factors for the production of CLEA of laccases alone or in combination with other oxidoreductases and improved them by applying rational experimental design and optimization methodologies. The resulting CLEA were considerably more robust than their free counterparts. A uniform size distribution of the CLEA was shown using light microscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The results are exploited in continuous membrane reactors for the biotransformation of micropollutants such as bisphenol A or nonylphenol...|$|R

This work describes {{the integration of}} multi-step enzymatic pathway construction with <b>enzyme</b> kinetics and <b>bioreactor</b> modelling, in order to optimise the synthesis of chiral amino-alcohols using engineered Escherichia coli transketolases (TK) and the Chromobacterium violaceum transaminase (TAm). The specific target products were (2 S, 3 S) - 2 -aminopentane- 1, 3 -diol (APD) and (2 S, 3 R) - 2 -amino- 1, 3, 4 -butanetriol (ABT). Kinetic models and parameters {{for each of the}} enzymatic steps were first obtained using automated microwell experiments. These identified the TK-catalysed conversions as being up to 25 times faster than the subsequent TAm conversions and inhibition of TAm by the amino-donor used, (S) -(−) -α-methylbenzylamine (MBA), as limiting the overall conversion yields. In order to better ‘match’ the relative rates of the two enzymes an E. coli expression system, based on two compatible plasmids, was constructed to produce both enzymes in a single host. By control of induction time and temperature it was possible to produce six times more recombinant TAm than TK to help balance the reaction rates. To overcome MBA inhibition and an unfavourable reaction equilibrium, fed-batch addition of the amino-donor was introduced as well as the use of isopropylamine as an alternate amino-donor. Adopting these strategies, and using the kinetic models to optimise feeding strategies, the one pot syntheses of APD and ABT were successfully scaled-up to preparative scales. Excellent agreement was found between the kinetic profiles and yields predicted and those achieved experimentally at the larger scale. In this case the integration of these multi-disciplinary approaches enabled us to achieve up to a 6 fold greater yield using concentrations an order of magnitude higher than in previous preparative scale batch bioconversions carried out sequentially...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} worldwide {{contamination of}} freshwater system with micro-pollutants {{emerges as a}} critical environmental problem, which has driven the search for novel mitigation approaches. The use of enzymes such as laccase as biocatalyst has been recognised as a promising approach for micro-pollutants removal. However, rapid denaturation of the free enzyme and its difficulty in recycling and reuse restrict its wider application, and efficient <b>enzyme</b> immobilization and <b>bioreactor</b> design are required. In this study, and two membrane bioreactors were proposed for carbamazepine (CBZ) degradation: the hybrid membrane system where laccase-immobilized TiO 2 nanoparticles were suspended in the feed solution, and the biocatalytic membrane reactor where laccase was immobilised on TiO 2 coated membrane surface. Using p-coumaric acid as a mediator, efficient CBZ removal (up to 71 %) was achieved with the hybrid membrane reactor. Functionalized TiO 2 nanoparticles were further applied to immobilize crude enzyme extracts from P. ostreatus culture. The resultant biocatalytic particles had comparable performance to the immobilized purified commercial laccase and showed efficient bisphenol-A and CBZ removal in the hybrid reactor. In addition, a cross-linked carbon nanotubes (CNTs) based membrane was prepared, which exhibited high effectiveness as support for physical adsorption of laccase. The active laccase coating on CNTs membrane can be renewed after simple cleaning and re-immobilization. The biocatalytic membrane also showed substantial improvement in micro-pollutant removal compared with the membrane having no enzyme. At last, it is demonstrated that the intramolecular electron transfer within single enzyme molecule is an important alternative pathway which can be harnessed to generate electricity. By decoupling the redox reaction within laccase, efficient electricity production from unconventional fuels including recalcitrant pollutants and/or toxic organic was obtained in a sole-laccase based enzymatic fuel cell. The intramolecular electron-harnessing concept was also demonstrated with other enzymes, including the power generation during CO 2 bioconversion to formate catalysed by formate dehydrogenase.

40|$|Bioremediation of {{aromatic}} pollutants {{using the}} ligninolytic enzymes {{of the white}} rot fungi has been thoroughly researched and {{has been shown to}} have considerable potential for industrial application. However, little success in scale-up and industrialisation of this technology has been attained due to problems associated with the continuous production of the pollutant-degrading <b>enzymes</b> using conventional <b>bioreactor</b> systems. The low productivities reported result from the incompatibility of conventional submerged culture reactor techniques with the physiological requirements of these fungi which have evolved on a solid-air interface, viz. wood. The enzymes are also produced only during the stationary phase of growth and can therefore be regarded as secondary metabolites. This study reports the conceptualisation, characterisation and evaluation of a novel bioreactor system as a solution to the continuous production of idiophasic pollutant degrading enzymes by the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chlysosporium. The reactor concept evolved from observation of these fungi in their native state, i. e. the metabolism of lignocellulosic material and involves the immobilisation of the organism onto a capillary ultrafiltration membrane. Nutrient gradients established across the biofilm, an inherent characteristic of fixed bed perfusion reactors, are exploited to provide both nutrient rich and nutrient poor zones across the biofilm. This allows growth or primary metabolism in the nutrient rich zone, pushing older biomass into the nutrient poor zone where secondary metabolism is induced by nutrient starvation. In effect, this represents a transformation of the events of a batch culture from a temporal to a spatial domain, allowing continuous production of secondary metabolites over time. Direct contact of the outer part of the biofilm with an air stream simulated the solid-air interface of the native state of the fungus. In order to facilitate the practical application of the membrane gradostat reactor (MGR) concept, conventional capillary membranes and membrane bioreactor modules were first evaluated. These were found to be unsuitable for application of the MGR concept. However, critical analysis of the shortcomings of the conventional systems resulted in the formulation of a set of design criteria {{for the development of a}} suitable membrane and module. These design criteria were satisfied by the development of a novel capillary membrane for membrane bioreactors, as well as a transverse flow membrane module, which is a novel approach in membrane bioreactor configuration. For the physiological characterisation of the MGR concept, a single fibre bioreactor unit was designed, which allowed destructive sampling of the biofilm for analysis. Using this system, it was shown that distinct morphological zones could be observed radially across the mature biofilm obtained through MGR operation. That these morphotypes do represent the temporal events of a typical batch culture in a spatial domain was confirmed by following the morphological changes occurring during batch culture of the immobilised fungus where the onset of primary and secondary metabolic conditions were manipulated through control of the nutrient supply. The different morphotypes were correlated to distinct growth phases by comparison of the morphology to the secretion of known enzymatic markers for secondary metabolism, viz. succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome C oxidoreductase. Detailed structure-function analysis of the biofilm using transmission electron microscopy and adapted enzyme cytochemical staining techniques showed that the biofilm appeared to operate as a co-ordinated unit, with primary and secondary metabolism apparently linked in one thallus through nutrient translocation. This study provided new insights into the physiology of P. chrysosp,o rium and a detailed descriptive model was formulated which correlates well to existing models of wood degradation by the white rot fungi (WRF). Evaluation of the process on a laboratory scale using a novel transverse flow membrane bioreactor showed that a volumetric productivity of 1916 U. L. ⁻¹day⁻¹ for manganese peroxidase, one of the pollutant degrading enzymes, could be attained, corresponding to a final concentration of 2 361 U. L. ⁻¹ This may be compared to the best reported system (Moreira el at. 1997), where a volumetric productivity of 202 U. L. ⁻¹day⁻¹was achieved with a final concentration of 250 U. L. ⁻¹ However, MGR productivity is yet to be subjected to rigorous optimisation studies. The process could be operated continuously for 60 days. However, peak productivity could not be maintained for long periods. This was found to be due to physical phenomena relating to the fluid dynamics of the system which caused fluid flow maldistribution, which would have to be resolved through engineering analysis. In evaluation of the MGR concept for aromatic pollutant removal, in this case ρ- cresol, from growth medium, good performance was also achieved. The VmaxKm calculated by linear regression for the MGR was 0. 8 (R² = 0. 93), which compared favourably to that reported by Lewandowski et al. (1990), who obtained a Vmax/Km of 0. 34 for a packed bed reactor treating chlorophenol. It was concluded that the MGR showed suitable potential to warrant further development, and that the descriptive characterisation of the biofilm physiology provided a sufficient basis for process analysis once engineering aspects ofthe system could be resolved. ...|$|R
