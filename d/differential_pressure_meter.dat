40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Civil Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the CAPE PENINSULA UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY 2014 The current problems of orifice, nozzle and Venturi flow meters are that they are limited to turbulent flow and the permanent pressure drop produced in the pipeline. To improve these inadequacies, converging-diverging (C-D) tubes were manufactured, consisting of symmetrical converging and diverging cones, where the throat is the annular section between the two cones, with various angles and diameter ratios to improve the permanent pressure loss and flow measurement range. The objective {{of this study was}} firstly to evaluate the permanent pressure loss, secondly to determine the discharge coefficient values for various C-D tubes and compare them with the existing <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> flow <b>meter</b> using Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, and finally to assess the performance of these <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> flow <b>meters.</b> The tests were conducted on the multipurpose test rig in the slurry laboratory at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids were used to conduct experiments in five different C-D tube flow meters with diameter ratios (β) of 0. 5, 0. 6 and 0. 7, and with angles of the wall to the axis of the tube (θ) of 15 °, 30 ° and 45 °. The results for each test are presented firstly in the form of static pressure at different flow rates. It was observed that the permanent pressure loss decreases with the flow rate and the length of the C-D tube. Secondly, the results are presented in terms of discharge coefficient versus Reynolds number. It was found that the Cd values at 15 ° drop earlier than at 30 ° and 45 °; when viscous forces become predominant, the Cd increases with increasing beta ratio. The Cd was found to be independent of the Reynolds number for Re> 2000 and also a function of angle and beta ratio. Preamble Performance of a symmetrical converging-diverging tube <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> flow <b>meter</b> Finally, the error analyses of discharge coefficients were assessed to determine the performance criteria. The standard variation was found to increase when the Reynolds number decreases. The average discharge coefficient values and their uncertainties were determined to select the most promising C-D tube geometry. An average Cd of 0. 96, with an uncertainty of ± 0. 5 % for a range of Reynolds numbers greater than 2, 000 was found. The comparison between C-D tubes 0. 6 (15 - 15) and classical Venturi flow meters reveals that C-D 0. 6 (15 - 15) performs well in turbulent range and shows only a slight inaccuracy in laminar.

40|$|The {{response}} of slotted plate, Venturi meter and standard orifice {{to the presence}} of two phase, three phase and low differential flows was investigated. Two mixtures (air-water and air-oil) were used in the two-phase analysis while a mixture of air, water and oil was employed in the three-phase case. Due to the high gas void fraction (&# 945;> 0. 9), the mixture was considered wet gas. A slotted plate was utilized in the low <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> analysis and the discharge coefficient behavior was analyzed. Assuming homogeneous flow, an equation with two unknowns was obtained for the multi-phase flow analysis. An empirical relation and the differential {{response of}} the meters were used to estimate the variables involved in the equation. Good performance in the gas mass flow rate estimation was exhibited by the slotted and standard plates for the air-water flow, while poor results were obtained for the air-oil and air-water oil flows. The performance of all the flow meter tested in the analysis improved for <b>differential</b> <b>pressures</b> greater than 24. 9 kPa (100 in_H 2 O). Due to the tendency to a zero value for the liquid flow, the error of the estimation reached values of more than 500 % at high qualities and low <b>differential</b> <b>pressures.</b> Air-oil and air-water-oil flows show that liquid viscosity influences the response of the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>meters.</b> The best results for high liquid viscosity were obtained in the Venturi meter using the recovery pressure for the gas flow estimation at <b>differential</b> <b>pressures</b> greater than 24. 9 kPa (100 in_H 2 O).

40|$|Based on year-long cross-correlations of {{broad-band}} seismic records {{obtained at}} sixty-six stations within or {{adjacent to the}} Pacific Basin, we show that broad-band ambient noise is observed to propagate coherently between island stations and between island and continent stations. For many station pairs, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fundamental mode Rayleigh wave Green functions are observed, which establishes the physical basis for ambient noise tomography across the Pacific. Similar trends for continental and oceanic stations are observed {{in the relationship between}} the ambient noise level at a 1 station and the “noise coherence distance ” – the longest distance at which a high SNR cross-correlation signal is observed for a station. Because locally generated noise obscures long distance coherent noise, situating stations at quiet locations on islands is necessary for the success of ambient noise tomography. Local noise poses a particular challenge at atoll sites and, on the basis of analysis of data from station H 2 O, at ocean bottom sites at periods above ~ 25 sec.

The experimental investigation was undertaken to obtain data for modelling the flow of dense phase fly ash slurries.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the Reynolds number (Re) and discharge coefficients (C) was investigated through <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> flow <b>meters.</b> The focus {{of the study was}} directed toward very small Reynolds numbers commonly associated with pipeline transportation of viscous fluids. There is currently a relatively small amount of research that has been performed in this area for the Venturi, standard orifice plate, V-cone, and wedge flow meters. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program FLUENT© was used to perform the research, while GAMBIT© was used as the preprocessing tool for the flow meter models created. Heavy oil and water were used separately as the two flowing fluids to obtain a wide range of Reynolds numbers with high precision. Multiple models were used with varying characteristics, such as pipe size and meter geometry, to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} C vs. Re relationship. All of the simulated numerical models were compared to physical data to determine the accuracy of the models. The study indicates that the various discharge coefficients decrease rapidly as the Reynolds number approaches 1 for each of the flow meters; however, the Reynolds number range in which the discharge coefficients were constant varied with meter design. The standard orifice plate does not follow the general trend in the discharge coefficient curve that the other flow meters do; instead as the Re decreases, the C value increases to a maximum before sharply dropping off. Several graphs demonstrating the varying relationships and outcomes are presented. The primary focus of this research was to obtain further understanding of discharge coefficient performance versus Reynolds number for differential producing flow meters at very small Reynolds numbers...|$|R

40|$|The {{orifice plate}} flow meter {{is the most}} common form of <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> flow <b>meter</b> used in industry. The {{standard}} discharge coefficient, which is defined by both British Standard and [SO 5167, is only valid if the flow approaching the meter is perfectly settled and fully developed. However, in practical applications the flow approaching the orifice meter is often disturbed by pipe-fittings and consequently the measurements become inaccurate. Basically, the design of the orifice plate meters that are independent of the upstream disturbances is a main goal for orifice plate metering. Either using a long straight pipe, or a flow conditioner upstream of an orifice plate, usually achieves this goal. In this project the effect of the fractal flow conditioner for both standard and non-standard flow conditions has been investigated in an experimental rig and simulation work. The results of using a combination of the fratal flow conditioner and orifice plate for non-standard flow conditions including swirling flow and asymmetric flow show that this package can preserve the accuracy of metering up to the level required in the Standards. The simulation results also show that the device can be used as a part of a flow metering package that will considerably reduce installation lengths. According to the main idea to introduce a predetermined turbulence flow caused by a flow conditioner for orifice plate flow metering, author was introduced another type of flow conditioner known as a metal foam flow conditioner. Open-cell metal foams with a porosity of 78. 8 % was formed and fashioned as a flow conditioner. Again the experimental results using the metal foam flow conditioner showed this metal foam flow conditioner demonstrated a good performance in terms of removing swirl and producing a repeatedly same flow profile within a short distance downstream of the flow conditioner. Furthermore, the low pressure drop across the metal foam is another advantage of this flow conditioner where the pressure loss coefficient for this flow conditioner is approximately 2. 5.

40|$|For this project, Environment Mapping & Surveying (EMS) from South Africa has {{provided}} two <b>pressure</b> <b>meters</b> for wave measuring.

Therefore {{is the purpose of}} this report to test the <b>pressure</b> <b>meter</b> and to convert the outcomes of the <b>pressure</b> <b>meter</b> to wave heights, resulting in a Rayleigh distribution and a wave spectrum. At first, there were calibration tests in still water to measure the hydrostatic <b>pressure.</b> The <b>pressure</b> <b>meter</b> was lowered in the water, with some stops, hanging still. At that moment the water depth could be found in the graph of the measured values in the time, so the relation between the water depth and the measured values is found. With that relation it is possible to find the relation between the measured values and the real pressure. After this, the verification tests are done. These tests are done in the Delta Flume of Deltares, during the Bardex II project. The <b>pressure</b> <b>meter</b> was lowered into the flume, to measure the waves that were made for the Bardex II project. After this, the outcomes were converted by three Matlab-scripts into a Rayleigh distribution, a wave spectrum and some characteristic values, like Hs and Hm 0.

40|$|The study {{reported}} in this thesis aims at improving the understanding of oil-water flows in horizontal and slightly inclined pipes. The experimental activities are {{carried out in the}} multiphase flow facility at Telemark University College in Porsgrunn, Norway. The experiments are performed using Exxsol D 60 oil (density 790 kg/m 3 and viscosity 1. 64 mPa s) and water (996 kg/m 3 and viscosity 1. 00 mPa s) as test fluids at room temperature and atmospheric outlet pressure. The test section is a 15 m long steel pipe with inner diameter equal to 56 mm. The pipe inclination is changed in the range from 5 ° upward to 5 ° downward. The cross-sectional distribution of phase fractions in the flow is measured using a traversable single-beam gamma densitometer. The total pressure drop over the test section is measured using <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>meters</b> and the frictional pressure drop is estimated based on water hold-up measurements. The instantaneous local velocities are measured using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and based on the instantaneous local velocities mean velocities and turbulence fluctuations are estimated. The observed flow patterns are categorized into eight different flow regimes and presented in terms of flow pattern maps for different pipe inclinations. In general, higher water hold-up values are observed for upwardly inclined pipes. In downwardly inclined pipes, lower water hold-up values are observed compared to the horizontal and upwardly inclined pipes. The measurements show that the water hold-up of oil-water flow is very sensitive for pipe inclination at lower mixture velocities for near horizontal flows (- 1 º and + 1 º). At low mixture velocities, the slip ratio decreases as inlet water cut increases. This decrease is prominent in the upward inclinations, while it is more moderate in the downward inclinations. As the mixture velocity increases the slip ratio approaches one, due to increased level of mixing. The frictional pressure drop is estimated based on measured total pressure drop and averaged water hold-up data. At low mixture velocity, there are smaller variations of frictional pressure drop with inlet water cut. A peak in pressure drop is observed at higher inlet water cuts at higher mixture velocities. The observed peak in frictional pressure drop {{can be attributed to the}} dispersion effect in the oil phase. The measured frictional pressure drop profiles for horizontal and inclined flows show some similarities in their overall shape. However, the frictional pressure drop in upwardly inclined pipes is slightly higher than the corresponding flow in horizontal pipes. This can be directly attributed to the increased turbulence level due to the interfacial waves observed in upwardly inclined flows. However, marginal differences in the frictional pressure drop are observed between horizontal and downwardly inclined flows. PIV measurements are validated using single-phase flow data. Two-phase PIV measurements are presented for horizontal and slightly inclined oil-water flows. PIV measurements of horizontal oil-water flow are compared with LDA measurements that were performed on a similar experimental set-up by Elseth (2001). A good agreement is observed between PIV and LDA measurements. A damping effect of Reynolds stress was observed close to the interface due to stable density stratification and the damping effect is pronounced at inlet water cut 0. 50. PIV measurements of inclined oil-water flows show that the mean velocity and turbulence profiles strongly depend on the pipe inclination. Two-dimensional axisymmetric computational scheme has been developed for predicting single-phase flow. The predictions show a good agreement with the experimental data. Stratified oil-water flows have been simulated based on Volume of Fluid (VOF) model and two equation turbulence models. Observed deviations between the predicted and measured data are discussed. </p...|$|R

These results will help a designer to suggest robust signal processing algorithms for vortex frequency detection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|After three {{cycles of}} WAG, {{when there was}} no more oil production, an ASP slug was {{injected}} into the core and then displaced by alternate injection of water and CO 2. There was an increase in <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> during the ASP slug injection which shows a flow resistance related to the formation and propagation of the oil bank in the core due to ASP injection. The increase in <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> is due to the mobilization of residual oil which persisted until oil bank breakthrough. The mobilized oil creates an oil bank in front of the ASP slug. As the oil bank size increases, the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> increases until oil bank breakthrough occurs. The second peak in the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> is related to the second oil bank generated that is associated with surfactant desorption and wettability changes. After the second oil bank breakthrough and microemulsion production, the conditions in the core and the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> profile are similar to that in the previous WAG process but slightly higher. This is possibly due to chemical slug effects such as adsorption and wettability changes.|$|R
