It has been observed that sometimes (e. g. 4 - 5 November 2000) the geomagnetic storm acts as an inhibitor (high strong spread-F season), whereas at other times (e. g. 11 - 12 July 2003) they act as an initiator (low strong spread-F season), possibly due to corresponding changes in the quiet and disturbed drift patterns during different seasons...|$|E

40|$|A new <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> station using a Canadian Advanced Digital Ionosonde (CADI) was {{established}} for routine measurements by the "Universidade do Vale do Paraiba (UNIVAP) " at S&# 227;o Jos&# 233; dos Campos (23. 2 ° S, 45. 9 ° W), Brazil, in August 2000. A major geomagnetic storm with gradual commencement at about 01 : 00  UT was observed on 31  March  2001. In this paper, we present and discuss salient features from the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> measurements {{carried out at}} S. J. Campos on the three consecutive UT days 30  March (quiet), 31  March (disturbed) and 1  April (recovery) 2001. During most of the storm period, the fo F 2 values showed negative phase, whereas during the two storm-time peaks, large F-region height variations were observed. In order to study the longitudinal differences observed in the F-region during the storm, the simultaneous <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> measurements carried out at S. J. Campos, El Arenosillo (37. 1 ° N, 6. 7 ° W), Spain, Okinawa (26. 3 ° N, 127. 8 ° E), Japan and Wakkanai (45. 5 ° N, 141. 7 ° E), Japan, during the period 30  March- 1  April 2001, have been analyzed. A comparison of the observed ionospheric parameters (h'F and fo F 2) in the two longitudinal zones (1. Japanese and 2. Brazilian-Spanish) shows both similarities and differences associated with the geomagnetic disturbances. Some latitudinal differences are also observed in the two longitudinal zones. In addition, global ionospheric TEC maps from the worldwide network of GPS receivers are presented, showing widespread TEC changes during both the main and recovery phases of the storm. The <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> measurements are compared with the ASPEN-TIMEGCM model runs appropriate for the storm conditions. The model results produce better agreement during the quiet period. During the disturbed period, some of the observed F-region height variations are well reproduced by the model results. The model fo F 2 and TEC results differ considerably during the recovery period and indicate much stronger negative phase at all the stations, particularly at the low-latitude ones...|$|E
