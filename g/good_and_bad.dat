5|$|Icke {{combines}} New Age philosophical {{discussion about}} the universe and consciousness with conspiracy theories about public figures being reptilian humanoids and paedophiles. He argues in favour of reincarnation; a collective consciousness that has intentionality; modal realism (that other possible worlds exist alongside ours); and the law of attraction (that <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> thoughts can attract experiences).|$|E
5|$|Major {{themes in}} the series deal with adventure, {{forbidden}} love, the concept of nature vs. nurture, the reactions of different faiths meeting each other, and characters being a mix of <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad.</b> The authors draw inspiration from several natural locations and other authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, J. K. Rowling, and William Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Other genres were {{combined}} in Franklin J. Schaffner's Patton (1970), about real life General George S. Patton, where combat scenes were interleaved with commentary {{about how he}} waged war, showing <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> sides to a command. It and MASH became the two most profitable war/anti-war films made up to that time; and Patton won seven Academy Awards.|$|E

5|$|The Shasekishū, {{a book of}} Buddhist parables {{from the}} Kamakura period, {{makes a point of}} {{distinguishing}} between <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> tengu. The book explains that the former are in command of the latter and are the protectors, not opponents, of Buddhism– although the flaw of pride or ambition has caused them to fall onto the demon road, they remain the same basically good, dharma-abiding persons they were in life.|$|E

5|$|Bound for Glory was {{received}} with mixed reviews. Canadian Online Explorer pro wrestling section writer Matt Bishop graded the event a 7 out of 10, {{the same as}} last year's event. He stated, “TNA's biggest show of the year, Bound For Glory, was a mix of <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad.</b> The show's biggest matches delivered on a show that featured a weak undercard”. He also gave the main event 8 out of 10, and the Lethal Lockdown match 7 out of 10. His lowest scores were for the Knockouts Title match that was given a 2 out of 10 and the Young-Jordan versus Neal-Moore match that was rated a dud.|$|E

5|$|In the {{interests}} of keeping the strip exciting, it seemed that no season for Melchester Rovers could ever consist of mid-table obscurity. Almost every year, the club was either competing for the major honours {{at the top of}} the domestic and European game, or struggling against relegation to lower divisions. Often, such spells of <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> fortune and form would directly succeed one another—a Rovers team that won the European Cup one year could find itself struggling to stay in Division One the next.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{transformed}} Carmarthen into {{an international}} trading port, the only staple port in Wales. Merchants imported food and French wines and exported wool, pelts, leather, lead and tin. In the late medieval period the county's fortunes varied, as <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> harvests occurred, increased taxes were levied by England, there were episodes of plague, and recruitment for wars removed the young men. Carmarthen was particularly susceptible to plague as it was brought in by flea-infested rats on board ships from southern France.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Stafford {{said there}} were <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> points to working closely with Weston. His {{knowledge}} of her {{made it easy for}} him to arrange her music, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because he knew she was capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because she thought her voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as she was in the bath {{getting ready to go to}} the studio.|$|E
40|$|Can all {{goods or}} bads {{be broken down}} into smaller and smaller pieces? Can all goods or bads be added {{together}} with some other good or bad to get a larger amount? Further, how does moral significance track the disaggregation and the aggregation of moral <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> <b>bads?</b> In Part 1, I examine the limits placed on aggregation by moderate deontological moral theories. This paper focuses in particular on the work of Judith Thomson and T. M. Scanlon as well as on some of my own past work on the question of aggregation in the context of overriding rights. In Part 2, I examine consequentialist criticism that harms and benefits can {{be broken down into}} smaller pieces than the deontological theory allows and the argument that the moderate deontological view is too permissive since it allows aggregation of benefits within a single person 2 ̆ 7 s life. In Part 3 I suggest how a moderate deontological moral theory might respond to the criticisms. I cast my answer in terms of the existence of lumpy <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> <b>bads.</b> I argue that consequentialist critics of deontology are wrong to insist that all <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> <b>bads</b> can be disaggregated and aggregated at will. Instead, I offer the suggestion that most, or many, <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> <b>bads</b> come in morally significant lumps. That said, it will not always be obvious what those lumps are. Determining the texture of moral value is a substantive project in normative ethics. All I have hoped to do in this paper is suggest that two standard positions on how to group moral value are mistaken and give hope that we need not adopt one of the two. Part 4 of the paper responds to an objection and sets the stage for further work in value theory...|$|R

5|$|The poem is an elegy in {{name but}} not in form; it employs a style {{similar to that of}} {{contemporary}} odes, but it embodies a meditation on death, and remembrance after death. The poem argues that the remembrance can be <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad,</b> and the narrator finds comfort in pondering the lives of the obscure rustics buried in the churchyard. The two versions of the poem, Stanzas and Elegy, approach death differently; the first contains a stoic response to death, but the final version contains an epitaph which serves to repress the narrator's fear of dying. With its discussion of, and focus on, the obscure and the known, the poem has possible political ramifications, but it does not make any definite claims on politics to be more universal in its approach to life and death.|$|E
5|$|Karas is {{the title}} for the city's {{appointed}} agents. Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft, they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine's chanting of a Shinto prayer. Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas dark nature by drawing their faces in shadows. Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with spotlights. Animators touched up film frames by hand, creating an effect different from cel-shaded animation. To make the Karas more menacing, they highlighted the eyes as if light bulbs were shining through them, a technique inspired by the suitmation practice of using light bulbs for the eyes of costumes. Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London, inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them. He stated ravens {{are believed to be}} omens of <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> in superstitions, and they always seem to be watching over the cities. This resonated with his view of the raven in the story Noah's Ark, which cursed Noah as it scouted for land. The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice the same of cats and conceive the Yurines as catgirls.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 1905, American author Molly Elliot Seawell sailed for Europe on Kroonland on a {{day when}} six liners, with over 1,500 passengers, {{departed}} New York. In October, Helen Taft returned from Europe on Kroonland and was met by her husband, Secretary of War William Howard Taft. The next August, Henry Yates Satterlee, the first Episcopal Bishop of Washington, returned on Kroonland from a six-week tour of cathedrals of Europe, during which he noted both <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> design elements of cathedrals in preparation for the building of the Washington National Cathedral. Also returning on the same voyage were Admiral Charles Sperry and Lieutenant Daniel W. Wurtsbaugh of the U.S. Navy, and Brigadier General Robert O'Reilly, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army; all were American delegates to the Second Geneva Convention. It was not the first trip on Kroonland for either Satterlee and O'Reilly. Satterlee had traveled on the liner the previous May to visit the spa town of Bad Nauheim in Hesse; O'Reilly had been on the November 1904 trip in which Kroonland had been reported as sunk.|$|E
