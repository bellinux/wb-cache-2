At North Dakota College of Science, his Defense ranked 9th Nationally at 227 Yards Per Game, and helped NDSCS to a Graphic <b>Edge</b> <b>Bowl</b> Win.

50|$|From the B&O's old {{central station}} in {{downtown}} Winchester, the Winchester and Western Railroad ventures south and then follows Abram's Creek west {{out of the}} city. From there, the W&W travels northwest, eventually parallelling the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) where it goes through Hoop Petticoat Gap along Gap Run at Chambersville, today known as Round Hill. Still heading in a northwest direction with the Northwestern Turnpike, the W&W departs from the turnpike and follows Hogue Creek north, southeast of Hayfield. The W&W continues north until it intersects with the North Frederick Pike (U.S. Route 522) and enters the community of Gainesboro. The line then curves southwest into the Back Creek valley. At the southern <b>edge</b> of <b>Bowling</b> Green Ridge, the W&W crosses the Northwestern Turnpike one last time and follows Back Creek south to Gore. From Gore, the line heads south along Mine Spring Run where it currently ends at the sand mine.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} claimed that focused hot {{cylindrical}} upwelling plumes cause {{many of the}} surface volcanic hotspots on Earth. It has also been argued that they must originate from thermal boundary layers. In this paper, we present spherical simulations of mantle circulation at close to Earth-like vigor with significant internal heating. These show, in addition to thermal boundary layer plumes, {{a new class of}} plumes that are not rooted in thermal boundary layers. These plumes develop as instabilities from the <b>edge</b> of <b>bowls</b> of hot mantle, which are produced by cold downwelling material deforming hot sheets of mantle. The resulting bowl and plume structure can look a bit like the â€œsplashâ€� of a water droplet. These splash plumes might provide an explanation for some hotspots that are not underlain by thermal boundary layerâ€“sourced plumes and not initiated by large igneous provinces. We suggest that in Earth's mantle, lithospheric instabilities or small pieces of subducting slab could play the role of the model downwelling material in initiating splash plumes. Splash plumes would have implications for interpreting ocean-island basalt geochemistry, plume fixity, excess plume temperature, and estimating core heat flux. Improved seismic imaging will ultimately test this hypothesis...|$|R
