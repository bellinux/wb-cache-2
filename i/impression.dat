He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got the <b>impression</b> that the US was intervening in the conflict.

The low-budget video directed by Ed Steinberg showed Madonna and her friends in a club singing and dancing to the song. The video helped to further promote the song and Madonna as an artist.|$|E

5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by an expanse of green lawn, the plan is usually clearly visible at ground level, {{which is not the}} case with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general <b>impression</b> is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an <b>impression</b> of tremendous length and have been described as resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E

40|$|The {{interface}} between tourism and built heritage is complicated because much built heritage {{is located in}} the middle of living communities. Questions arise about how to achieve a balance between the expectations of tourists and the community. To study this question, this paper reports on tourists’ and residents’ <b>impressions</b> of an international heritage tourism site, the Kampong Taman Sari in Indonesia. Using a linear-numeric semantic differential as the measuring instrument and nine consensus photographs of the site as stimuli, the study investigated similarities and differences in <b>impressions</b> between three groups: tourists (international and domestic) and residents. Three principal dimensions were found to underlie <b>impressions</b> of the site: Attractiveness, Organisation, and Novelty. Significant differences were found among all three groups in their <b>impressions</b> of Attractiveness. In terms of <b>impressions</b> of the Organisation of the site, international and domestic tourists have similar <b>impressions</b> but these differ significantly from the <b>impressions</b> of residents. On the other hand, domestic tourists and residents have similar <b>impressions</b> of the Novelty of the site, which is evaluated differently by international tourists...|$|R
40|$|We {{determined}} {{the sensitivity of}} perianal tape <b>impressions</b> to detect Syphacia spp. in rats and mice. We evaluated 300 rat and 200 mouse perianal <b>impressions</b> over 9 wk. Pinworm-positive perianal tape <b>impressions</b> from animals with worm burdens at necropsy were considered as true positives. Conversely, pinworm-negative perianal tape <b>impressions</b> from animals with worm burdens were considered false negatives. The sensitivity of perianal tape <b>impressions</b> for detecting Syphacia muris infections in rats was 100 %, and for detecting Syphacia obvelata in mice was 85. 5 %. Intermittent shedding of Syphacia obvelata ova is the most probable explanation for the decreased sensitivity rate we observed in mice. We urge caution in use of perianal tape <b>impressions</b> alone for Syphacia spp. screening in sentinel mice and rats...|$|R
