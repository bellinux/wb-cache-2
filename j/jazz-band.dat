5000|$|When {{you listen}} to her music, {{you can go to}} the quest for the {{different}} musics which have had a strong influence on her style. Of course, there is the jazz - since her debuts with the records of her parents, up to her first <b>jazz-band.</b> Her compositions, even today leave a big part to improvisation. Oft one could find on her partitions [...] only an indication of chord on which she will improvise during the concert. Her very thorough and classic training of music brings an instrumental acuteness and sharpness to her music. Each break is controlled, each period has its sens. She puts her music together using repetitions of more or less long terms, according to the tradition of the ostinato.Music is not her sole inspiration, she is also an artist with words. She works with them as she works with musical subjects. A lot of these play-on-words have an artist´s words for inspiration. Alles aber Anders, from Eva Hesse´s journal, is a particularly interesting example; she repeats certain words according to a particular rhythm, replaced by a sound, until exhaustion. Just like these visual artists (Eva Hesse, Louise Bourgeois), whose words she puts into music, we can hear breaks, [...] "flat areas", as if she were drawing musical landscapes with big streaks of colors.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1961 and 1969 Ó Riada {{lead the}} Ceoltóirí Chualann group. They played in concert halls {{dressed in black}} suits with white shirts and black bow ties, but relied on {{traditional}} songs and tunes. An ordinary céilidh band or show-band would have musicians who competed {{with each other to}} grab the attention of the audience. Ceoltóirí Chualann played sparse lucid arrangements. Ó Riada sat in the middle at front playing a harpsichord and a bodhrán, a hand-held frame-drum. This was an instrument that had almost died out, being played only by small boys in street parades. Ceilí bands generally had <b>jazz-band</b> drum-kits. Ó Riada also wanted to use the clarsach or wire-strung harp in the band, but as these were as yet unavailable, he played the harpsichord instead - in his opinion the nearest sound to a clarsach. The harpsichord he used on a regular basis was made by Cathal Gannon. Unknown to Ó Riada, Irish folk music was being played ensemble-style in London pubs, but for most people of Ireland {{this was the first time}} they heard these tunes played by a band. For some, the membership of Ceoltóirí Chualann overlapped with that of The Chieftains. They recorded the soundtrack of the film Playboy of the Western World (original play by John Millington Synge) in 1962. Their last public performance was in 1969, issued as the album [...] "Ó Riada Sa Gaiety".|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic's Richie Unterberger {{gives the}} album three stars, noting in it a certain monotony of mood and tempo, {{to which the}} Fischer tracks offer a welcome contrast:Clare Fischer's tense orchestral {{arrangements}} actually add a bit of wakeup spice to {{the latter part of}} the program, even as they heighten the sentimentality factor in some respects.Contemporaneous reviews likewise highlighted Fischer's efforts; the album's bipartite structure was duly noted by Billboard Magazine, with kudos reserved for side two:Tjader is heard in two contrasting types of ensemble. Side 1 has the vibes player in his usual small combo setting, while the flip side makes use of some unique section work with arrangements written by Clare Fischer. Better tracks include [...] "Over the Rainbow," [...] "The Man That Got Away," [...] and [...] "Blues in the Night." [...] The Washington Post's Tony Gieske elaborates on Fischer's contribution:Fischer's arrangements on one side of Cal Tjader Plays Harold Arlen are marked by unashamed eclecticism. He swipes string-section sounds (icy and twangy by turns) from the moderns, steals chords from Bartók's string quartets, throws in some Hollywood soundtrack stuff, conks on the bare piano strings, and fools around with counter-rhythms."Over the Rainbow" [...] opens with a lot of out of tempo effects, then has Tjader take the melody in a yearning six-eight, the strings playing against him in four. Like the other pieces, this abounds in tempo shifts, all of which work out swingingly.The most amazing thing, though, is that Fischer is theatrical. That is, all his tricks are just bright enough to keep the arrangements fresh without taking away from the sentimentality of Arlen's songs. He never gets solemn or super complex, like Russo. If Arlen says the mood is 'Bluesy,' Fischer doesn't try to correct him.Fischer's overriding purpose, I believe, is to entertain. Conservatory-trained, he is rationing out language that must seem common currency to him, and trying to get it into the common currency of the public at large. I hope he succeeds. I hope the Broadway boys will listen to him. I hope the <b>jazz-band</b> boys will listen to him. A half-century of the same voicings is enough.|$|E
