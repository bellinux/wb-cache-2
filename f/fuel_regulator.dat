Turbine jet engine operates at an open cycle called a jet propulsion cycle. A small-scale turbine jet engine comprises of the same element as the gas-turbine engine but in a smaller scale. Both engines differ in utilization and purpose of its production. Turbine jet engines were constructed mainly for air transportation while the small-scale turbine jet engines are developed for a wider purpose, ranging for research activity to hobbyist enthusiastic. Hence, this thesis encompasses the design, fabrication, and testing a small-scale turbine jet engine. The engine was derived from an automobile turbocharger, which provided the turbine and compressor component. A combustion chamber was design and fabricated. Engine support system comprised of ignition, lubrication and fuel delivery system were installed at the engine. The engine assembly was mounted in a test setup. Thermocouples were installed at three different stations on the engine flow path to measure the temperature. <b>Fuel</b> <b>regulators</b> were utilized to measure the fuel flow.

Troubleshooting and analysis regarding {{the failure of the}} engine was done. Analysis shows that there are four possible factors involves, namely, the uses of LPG fuel, large pressure drop at the exit of combustion chamber, low pressure pump and leaking at the turbocharger. Four recommendations were made for further studies, which are, utilize a brand-new turbocharger for the engine, use a pure propane gas as a source of fuel, avoid uses of pipe flange at the combustion chamber and utilize a higher pressure pump for lubrication system.

Using hydrogen natural gas blend (HCNG) fuel is promising technology which can reduce NOx and CO 2 emissions for a natural gas vehicle.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Cleveland altitude wind tunnel to determine the operational characteristics of an axial flow-type turbojet engine with a 4000 -pound-thrust rating over a range of pressure altitudes from 5, 000 to 50,OOO feet, ram pressure ratios from 1. 00 to 1. 86, and temperatures from 60 deg to - 50 deg F. The low-flow (standard) compressor with which the engine was originally equipped {{was replaced by a}} high-flow compressor for part of the investigation. The effects of altitude and airspeed on such operating characteristics as operating range, stability of combustion, acceleration, starting, operation of fuel-control systems, and bearing cooling were investigated. With the low-flow compressor, the engine could be operated at full speed without serious burner unbalance at altitudes up to 50, 000 feet. Increasing the altitude and airspeed greatly reduced the operable speed range of the engine by raising the minimum operating speed of the engine. In several runs with the high-flow compressor the maximum engine speed was limited to less than 7600 rpm by combustion blow-out, high tail-pipe temperatures, and compressor stall. Acceleration of the engine was relatively slow and the time required for acceleration increased with altitude. At maximum engine speed a sudden reduction in jet-nozzle area resulted in an immediate increase in thrust. The engine started normally and easily below 20, 000 feet with each configuration. The use of a high-voltage ignition system made possible starts at a pressure altitude of 40, 000 feet; but on these starts the tail-pipe temperatures were very high, a great deal of fuel burned in and behind the tail-pipe, and acceleration was very slow. Operation of the engine was similar with both fuel regulators except that the modified <b>fuel</b> <b>regulator</b> restricted the fuel flow in such a manner that the acceleration above 6000 rpm was very slow. The bearings did not cool properly at high altitudes and high engine speeds with a low-flow compressor, and bearing cooling was even poorer with a high-flow compressor...|$|E
