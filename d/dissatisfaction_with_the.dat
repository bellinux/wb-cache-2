5|$|As <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> secession grew, Ngalula {{and other}} South Kasaian émigrés in Léopoldville plotted to {{overthrow}} the regime in Bakwanga. In September 1962, the Léopoldville government appointed Albert Kankolongo as Special Commissioner (commissaire extraordinaire), giving him full military and civil power, to dismantle the local state. Ngalula approached Kankolongo to lead a mutiny and coup d'état against Kalonji.|$|E

5|$|Charles K. Feldman, the producer, had {{acquired}} the film rights in 1960 and {{had attempted to}} get Casino Royale made as an Eon Productions Bond film; however, Feldman and the producers of the Eon series, Albert R.

The budget escalated as various directors and writers got involved in the production, and actors expressed <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> project.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to {{government}} expectations the reform was neither popular nor productive. Agricultural harvests plummeted and the reform itself led to rising discontent amongst Afghans.

However, the land reform was gradually implemented under the later Karmal administration, although the proportion of land area impacted by the reform is unclear.|$|E
5|$|In {{support of}} the album, the Furs {{launched}} a concert tour beginning in the UK, with their performance at the Hammersmith Odeon (10 October) broadcast live on BBC Radio One. The tour included the session players Gary Windo and Ann Sheldon, {{as well as the}} keyboard player Ed Buller. One person who did not come with them was Vince Ely, whose long-simmering <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> band finally led to his departure, just after the album's recording was completed. Ely was replaced as drummer by Phill Calvert, formerly of The Birthday Party.|$|E

5|$|The Bosnian Muslims' <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ustaše {{rule of the}} NDH {{and their}} need for {{protection}} were combined with nostalgia {{for the period of}} Habsburg rule in Bosnia and a generally friendly attitude towards Germany among prominent Bosnian Muslims. These factors led to a push towards autonomy for the Bosnian Muslim community which was strongly opposed by Pavelić as counter to the territorial integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, the autonomists were desperate to protect the Muslim people and wrote to Adolf Hitler asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich.|$|E
5|$|Tyler {{declined}} to seek renomination in late 1820, citing ill health. He privately acknowledged his <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> position, as his opposing votes were largely symbolic and {{did little to}} change the political culture in Washington; he also observed that funding his children's education would be difficult on a congressman's low salary. He left office on March 3, 1821, endorsing his former opponent Stevenson for the seat, and returned to private law practice full-time.|$|E
5|$|After these slights, {{speculation}} {{was raised}} that Mathias {{would leave the}} Republican Party, especially as the 1980 elections were approaching. Several prominent conservatives in the state, such as U.S. Representatives Marjorie Holt and Robert Bauman, were considering challenging Mathias for his seat. In contrast, the Democratic {{side of the aisle}} had fewer challengers, suggesting Mathias would win renomination more easily if he were to switch parties. However, Mathias chose to remain as a Republican, and teamed up with eight other Republican senators to express their <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hard-line wing of the party. Mathias later stated that he had never seriously considered switching parties.|$|E

50|$|A fatwa {{calling for}} her {{beheading}} was {{issued by the}} mullahs of northern Nigeria, but was declared null and void by the relevant religious authorities in Saudi Arabia, and the Obasanjo faced an international public relations smearing (especially within journalistic circles) in the aftermath, which was not helped by the Amina Lawal controversy which had occurred prior to the riots, which had seen over 200 dead).

Ito and Suzuki felt that the portrayals of the Law and Chaos Heroes were imbalanced, with the Chaos Hero being too emotional and the Law Hero being unsympathetic. They also saw the demon fusion system as too difficult for players to master. Okada, while commenting on what improvements would {{be made for the}} next game, stated that there were too many useless items in the game. Niino felt that the game's pacing and flow needed to be addressed, as after naming the characters, the player immediately is prompted to divide their status points.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the start}} of the Arab Spring in 2011, Gaddafi spoke out in favour of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, then {{threatened}} by the Tunisian Revolution. He suggested that Tunisia's people would be satisfied if Ben Ali introduced a Jamahiriyah system there. Fearing domestic protest, Libya's government implemented preventative measures by reducing food prices, purging the army leadership of potential defectors and releasing several Islamist prisoners. They proved ineffective, and on 17 February 2011, major protests broke out against Gaddafi's government. Unlike Tunisia or Egypt, Libya was largely religiously homogeneous and had no strong Islamist movement, but there was widespread <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> corruption and entrenched systems of patronage, while unemployment had reached around 30%.|$|E
5|$|Goldman {{found it}} {{difficult}} to acclimate to the German leftist community in Berlin. Communists despised her outspokenness about Soviet repression; liberals derided her radicalism. While Berkman remained in Berlin helping Russian exiles, Goldman moved to London in September 1924. Upon her arrival, the novelist Rebecca West arranged a reception dinner for her, attended by philosopher Bertrand Russell, novelist H. G. Wells, and more than 200 other guests. When she spoke of her <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Soviet government, the audience was shocked. Some left the gathering; others berated her for prematurely criticizing the Communist experiment. Later, in a letter, Russell declined to support her efforts at systemic change in the Soviet Union and ridiculed her anarchist idealism.|$|E

50|$|Writer Sean Fagan {{claims that}} Rugby {{football}} was first played in Victoria {{in the late}} 1840s and into <b>the</b> 1850s.

5|$|In 1994, Moscoso ran as {{the presidential}} {{candidate}} of her deceased husband's Arnulfista Party (PA) in the general election, seeking to succeed PA president Guillermo Endara. Her main rivals were Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares and salsa singer Rubén Blades, who was then president of the party Papa Egoro. Moscoso and Blades sought to emphasize Pérez Balladares' connection with military ruler Manuel Noriega, broadcasting pictures of the two together, while Pérez Balladares worked to position himself as a successor to military ruler Omar Torrijos, who {{was regarded as a}} national hero. Moscoso's campaign, meanwhile, was hindered by public <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> perceived incompetence and corruption of Endara's government. Pérez Balladares ultimately won the election with 33% of the vote, with Moscoso receiving 29% and Blades receiving 17%.|$|E
5|$|In a statement, an EMI {{spokesperson}} {{maintained that}} the label {{had been forced to}} take procedural, legal steps in order to protect their investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management. However, Thirty Seconds to Mars also expressed <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> then-recent Terra Firma takeover of EMI, as most of the employees the band had worked with were fired {{as a result of a}} major restructuring under TF chairman Guy Hands. The band were among several of the label's artists, unhappy with the transition, who quickly tried to terminate their contracts; the list also included The Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney. Former EMI executives gave interviews describing how the sale resulted in massive upheaval and staff cuts.|$|E
5|$|Polling {{conducted}} throughout March 2009 by Maurice de Hond {{indicated the}} Party for Freedom {{was the most}} popular parliamentary party. The polls predicted that the party would take 21% of the national vote, winning 32 out of 150 seats in the Dutch parliament. If the polling results were replicated in an election, Wilders would be a major power broker. Under such circumstances, there would also be some likelihood of him becoming Prime Minister of the Netherlands. This has been partially attributed to timely prosecution attempts against him for hate speech and the travel ban imposed on him by the United Kingdom, as well as <b>dissatisfaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Dutch government's response to the global financial crisis of 2008–2009.|$|E
