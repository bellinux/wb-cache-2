She contends that Arular was a [...] "masculine" [...] album, but that Kala [...] "is about my mum and her struggle–how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>work,</b> feed your children, nurture them {{and give them the}} power of information?" [...] She further summed the album up as [...] "shapes, colours, Africa, street, power, bitch, nu world, and brave." [...] According to Dominic Horner of The Independent, the album's music may not be appropriately described exclusively as either dance or world music, but it is a mixture of the two. Music critic Robert Christgau characterised its music as an [...] "eclectic world-underclass dance amalgam", and Jonathan Brown of the Irish Independent cited Kala as a proper introduction to [...] "world fusion", a genre that [...] "blends sounds from across the globe which wouldn't – and some say shouldn't – be put together." [...] By contrast, NPR's Oliver Wang argued that, rather than a [...] "so-called world music fusion" [...] attempt, Kala is [...] "agitated, propulsive pop" [...] informed by international sounds. Music journalist Jody Rosen called it [...] "an agitprop dance record" [...] that reappropriates hip hop in an international setting with beatbox riddims, [...] "playground" [...] rhymes, unconventional samples, and gunshot sounds.|$|E
2500|$|During {{a lecture}} on {{autobiography}} and fiction, Franzen discussed four perennial questions often asked to him by audiences, all of which annoy him or bother him in some way. These are: (1) Who are your influences? (2) What time of day <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>work,</b> {{and what do you}} write on? (3) I read an interview with an author who says that, at a certain point in writing a novel, the characters [...] "take over" [...] and tell him what to do. Does this happen to you, too? (4) Is your fiction autobiographical? In the lecture he said of the third question in particular [...] "This one always raises my blood pressure" [...] and quoted Nabokov in response.|$|E
