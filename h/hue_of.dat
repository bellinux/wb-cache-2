It tarnishes on contact with moist air, and takes on a dull appearance the <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> which depends on the prevailing conditions. Characteristic properties of lead include high density, malleability, and high resistance to corrosion (due to passivation).|$|E

The horizon narrowed and widened, and dipped and rose, and at all times its edge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks.|$|E

5|$|The {{actions of}} Định {{in the wake}} of the Treaty of Saigon have long been a subject of conjecture. At the time, the French {{military}} accused <b>Huế</b> <b>of</b> surreptitiously supporting Định in contravention of the treaty, while Huế denied this, publicly claiming that Định's actions in resisting the French would be counterproductive in attempting to maintain Vietnamese sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|The female {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the male, but may be identified by her slightly paler upperparts, a browner eyestripe and a more washed-out tone to the flanks and lower belly. In the eastern form, S.e.asiatica, some males have buff underparts like the female, and birds with this appearance are difficult to sex in the field. Young birds resemble the female, although their plumage is duller and they have paler legs. Individuals can be reliably sexed as female from about 12days old by their paler and buffer flanks, or, in some white-breasted subspecies, by the creamier <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> their underparts.|$|E
5|$|Thus the FG01 did not promise much {{in terms}} of performance. It was angular and bulky, with poor {{aerodynamic}} performance negatively affecting grip and handling; it had a plump nose, initially no airbox, and was overweight and under-powered, using a small Ford-Cosworth ED V8 customer engine largely financed by Ford do Brasil, which developed an estimated 100bhp less than the most powerful engine in the field, the Renault V10 supplied to the Benetton and Williams teams. It was also the only car to have a manual gearbox in the 1995 F1 season. The car was liveried in a distinctive yellow-and-blue colour scheme accompanied by fluorescent green wheel-rims, illustrating the team's Brazilian influence in its first year. The precise <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> each colour was chosen {{as a tribute to}} Ayrton Senna, who had been killed at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix; the cars were liveried in identical shades to those used on the Brazilian's helmet design.|$|E

25|$|Cooks boil or steam live lobsters. When {{a lobster}} is cooked, its shell's colour changes from blue to orange because {{the heat from}} cooking breaks down a protein called crustacyanin, which {{suppresses}} the orange <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> the chemical astaxanthin, which {{is also found in}} the shell.|$|E
25|$|There {{are seven}} {{subspecies}} differing in the <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> the upperparts {{and the intensity}} of the rufous colour of the underparts; size varies across the subspecies by up to 10%. The races resident south of the Wallace Line have the bluest upperparts and partly blue ear-patches.|$|E
25|$|In 1892, the {{official}} {{colors of the}} university, royal blue and white, were adopted. An earlier color set, blue and light yellow, was adopted earlier at a Kentucky-Centre College football game on December 19, 1891. The particular <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> blue was determined from a necktie, which was used to demonstrate the color of royal blue.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the school}} was {{established}} as a department of the main branch of the University of Texas in Austin, the school's colors were originally orange and white. However, in the early 1980s, Columbia blue was added so now the official colors are orange, white, and blue. When the new UTEP athletic department logo {{was introduced in the}} fall of 1999, a darker <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> blue was incorporated into the logo, as well as a silver accent to go with the customary orange.|$|E
25|$|The Flamsteed {{designation}} 54 Piscium {{originated in}} the star catalogue of the British astronomer John Flamsteed, first published in 1712. It has an apparent magnitude of 5.86, allowing it {{to be seen with}} the unaided eye under suitable viewing conditions.The star has a classification of K0V, with the luminosity class V indicating this is a main sequence star that is generating energy at its core through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. The effective temperature of the photosphere is about 5,062K, giving it the characteristic orange <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> a K-type star.|$|E
25|$|Measurement of the star's {{spectrum}} show it {{to match}} a stellar classification of G1.5V, which {{is close to the}} Sun's spectral class of G2V. In the wavelength range 3200–8800Â, the energy emission of this star is very similar to the Sun, and thus it is considered a solar analog. The luminosity class 'V' means this is a main sequence star that is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The effective temperature of the outer envelope of HD 44594 is 5,840K, which is giving it the characteristic yellow <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> a G-type star.|$|E

25|$|When {{one of the}} {{components}} has the strongest intensity, the color is a hue near this primary color (reddish, greenish or bluish), and when two components have the same strongest intensity, then the color is a <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> a secondary color (a shade of cyan, magenta or yellow). A secondary color is formed by the sum of two primary colors of equal intensity: cyan is green+blue, magenta is red+blue, and yellow is red+green. Every secondary color is the complement of one primary color; when a primary and its complementary secondary color are added together, the result is white: cyan complements red, magenta complements green, and yellow complements blue.|$|E
25|$|Color: In the {{evaluation}} of colored gemstones, color {{is the most important}} factor. Color divides into three components: hue, saturation and tone. Hue refers to color as we normally use the term. Transparent gemstones occur in the pure spectral hues of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet. In nature, there are rarely pure hues, so when speaking of the <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> a gemstone, we speak of primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary hues. Ruby is defined to be red. All other hues of the gem species corundum are called sapphire. Ruby may exhibit a range of secondary hues, including orange, purple, violet, and pink.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, {{an order}} {{was given to}} a Greek firm for 200 crosses of a {{simplified}} design, but the result was again far from satisfactory: this type featured a purplish <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> blue, {{and the head of}} Athena was flipped and of bad quality. The situation was finally resolved in October 1984, with Presidential Decree 485, which established the current design as final. Since 1984, the orders awarded by the Greek Foreign Ministry and the Presidency of the Republic have been manufactured by the Swiss firm Huguenin Medailleurs, while orders issued to the personnel of the Greek Armed Forces and security forces have been of local manufacture.|$|E

25|$|The chromatophores are a sac {{containing}} {{hundreds of}} thousands of pigment granules and a large membrane that is folded when retracted. There are hundreds of muscles radiating from the chromatophore. These are under neural control and when they expand, they reveal the <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> the pigment contained in the sac. Cuttlefish have three types of chromatophore: yellow/orange (the uppermost layer), red, and brown/black (the deepest layer). The cuttlefish can control the contraction and relaxation of the muscles around individual chromatophores, thereby opening or closing the elastic sacs and allowing different levels of pigment to be exposed. Furthermore, the chromatophores contain luminescent protein nanostructures; there are tethered pigment granules which modify light through absorbance, reflection, and fluorescence between 650 and 720nm.|$|E
25|$|The diagram {{represents}} {{all of the}} chromaticities {{visible to}} the average person. These are shown in color and this region is called the gamut of human vision. The gamut of all visible chromaticities on the CIE plot is the tongue-shaped or horseshoe-shaped figure shown in color. The curved edge of the gamut is called the spectral locus and corresponds to monochromatic light (each point representing a pure <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> a single wavelength), with wavelengths listed in nanometers. The straight edge on {{the lower part of}} the gamut is called the line of purples. These colors, although they are on the border of the gamut, have no counterpart in monochromatic light. Less saturated colors appear in the interior of the figure with white at the center.|$|E
25|$|Most fish, {{reptiles}} and amphibians {{undergo a}} limited physiological colour change {{in response to a}} change in environment. This type of camouflage, known as background adaptation, most commonly appears as a slight darkening or lightening of skin tone to approximately mimic the <b>hue</b> <b>of</b> the immediate environment. It has been demonstrated that the background adaptation process is vision-dependent (it appears the animal {{needs to be able to}} see the environment to adapt to it), and that melanin translocation in melanophores is the major factor in colour change. Some animals, such as chameleons and anoles, have a highly developed background adaptation response capable of generating a number of different colours very rapidly. They have adapted the capability to change colour in response to temperature, mood, stress levels, and social cues, rather than to simply mimic their environment.|$|E
