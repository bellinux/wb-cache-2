40|$|International audienceThe {{evaluation}} of recovery rates extracting dried milk and egg powder using eleven different extractants led to approximately similar results for both foods. Compared {{to the other}} extraction solutions investigated, " 1 % Tween 20 and 0. 4 % Triton X- 100 " and " 4 % SDS" are the most qualified extractants to isolate proteins of hen's egg or milk. Comparing calculated protein recovery rates of egg and milk powder extracts the results clearly indicate that {{the choice of a}} suitable extractant is of particular importance. Qualitative investigation of the extracts via LDS - PAGE followed by silver staining as well as immunoblotting confirmed the results of protein quantification. Hence, the immunoblots showed that the used extraction agents had no negative influence onto the antigenicity of the extracted allergenic proteins. In this study, variation of extraction temperature neither led to any benefit in extraction quality nor to degradation. Changing pH did not reveal any tendencies but a progressive protein hydrolysis at strong alkaline. Evaluation of recovery rates as well as results of unspecific and specific staining of the extracts revealed that an extraction duration of one hour is sufficient for an appropriate sample preparation. For investigations with and without food matrix different results were obtained. In summary, wheat starch did not influence the extraction quality within all examined materials and different extractants. In contrast, using fat powder and <b>dry</b> <b>cake</b> mix, respectively, led to different results in extraction procedure.

The tested muds cover Freshwater/Gypsum/Lignosulphonate mud and SeawaterlKCLlPolymer mud, bariteweighted and unweighted. The {{effects of the}} solid concentration, pressure and shear rate on the filter cake characteristics and the erodability were investigated. For static filtration experiments, all tests were conducted for two hours and the spurt loss, the filter cake thickness, the ratio of wet to <b>dry</b> <b>cake</b> mass and the cumulative filtrate volume against time were measured. For dynamic filtration experiments, however, only the spurt loss and the cumulative filtrate volume against time were measured and all tests were conducted for at least 8 hours. A general filtration equation was developed based on the cake filtration theory prevailing in the chemical engineering industry and it was utilised to obtain the modified classic static filtration equation and the dynamic filtration equation. The modified classic static filtration equation was then employed to fit the static filtration experimental data and the average specific static cake resistance and the effective filter medium resistance were calculated. The dynamic filtration equation showed a substantial agreement with the dynamic filtration experimental data. Using the static filter cake properties such as the ratio of wet to <b>dry</b> <b>cake</b> mass (m), the average specific dynamic cake resistance, the effective filter medium resistance and the dynamic filter cake erodability were calculated.

Also, an attempt was carried out to predict the static filtration data and the dynamic filtration data in a sequential process.

No apparent distinction was found, however, between spurt loss and effective filter medium resistance.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of electro-osmotic dewatering (EOD) {{is quite different}} from that of mechanical dewatering. Compared with the mechanical dewatering, EOD can be remarkably effective for hardly dewaterable suspensions of very fine particles and gelatinous materials. However, the gradual discontinuity of liquid state in the dewatering material, due to the formation of an unsaturated layer at the anode, causes the electrical blockage rendering EOD no longer effective. Mixing is believed to reduce such an effect. Therefore, a research is conducted to investigate this effect by having the anode rotating. An experimental apparatus was specially designed for this study. It consisted of one acrylic plastic cylinder, one porous stainless steel plate and one circular stainless steel plate. The porous plate acted as the cathode, and the circular plate as the rotating anode. Bentonite sludge, with 9. lwt% initial solid content was used as the model sludge. The rotational speed varied from 0 to 300 rpm. Three commercial impellers (axial flow impeller, high-shear dispersing impeller and high-shear radial flow impellers) were also used as rotating anodes and tested for their performances on EOD. The experimental results showed that, by using a flat plate as the rotating anode, the water removed from the sludge increased significantly with the rotational speed initially and reached a plateau at 240 rpm. This was believed due to the "fall-off" of the cake from the anode during the rotation. The solid content of the cake could be 23. 0 wt%, 60 % better than the performance of normal EOD. Besides, the excessive suspension added {{on the top of the}} anode was found to have a beneficial effect for both water removal and suppression of drier cake formation. It was also found that a constant thickness of the cake formed (about 5 mm) was more efficient in electro-osmotic dewatering. The combined effects of anode rotation and <b>dry</b> <b>cake</b> thickness control could remove 56 % of the initial moisture within the suspension. It was 37 % better than normal EOD. Different commercial impellers performed similarly at the rotational speed of 240 rpm. In addition, the value of rpm= 60 was found to be the most effective condition for dewatering in the case of using high shear dispersing impeller. At this optimal condition, the water removal enhancement was comparable with those obtained using the rotating plate with the <b>dry</b> <b>cake</b> thickness control. The interesting experimental results were well explained following the fundamental analysis of EOD...|$|E

The starch (158. 4 g, dry solids) was dispersed in an aqueous solution containing xanthan and phosphate salts (1. 6 and 0. 6 g in 280 mL water, respectively), and the slurry was dried overnight at 458 C until the moisture content was less than 10 %. The <b>dry</b> <b>cake</b> was then ground into powders and heated for 2 h at 1308 C in a convection oven. The pasting viscosity, paste clarity, melting and in vitro diges-tion behaviors of the starches with modifying agents (xan-than and phosphate salts) were investigated. The heat treated starches displayed enhanced shear stability and reduced breakdown, as evidences of crosslinking. Xanthan (1. 0 % based on starch solids) enhanced the crosslinking effects in the viscosity profile. Waxy rice starch evidenced more profound viscosity changes than did normal rice starch, indicating it was more susceptible to the heat treat-ment. The waxy rice starch heated with the mixture of phosphate salts and xanthan exhibited a continuous increase in pasting viscosity without any breakdown. Under a DSC analysis, melting enthalpy decreased but melting temperature increased somewhat as results of the heat treatment with xanthan. In an in vitro digestion analy-sis, the starches treated with xanthan exhibited decreases in the maximum digestion level, and increases in the re-sistant starch (RS) content.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{dewatering}} on methanogenic sludge viability and activity influences both {{the feasibility of}} recuperative thickening to increase solids residence time within a digester, and the utilisation of dewatered sludge cake as digester inoculum. Thickening can reduce activity through either air contact (rotary drum, DAF, or belt filter press), or by lysing cells through shear (centrifuge), particularly at high solids. To assess this, two plants with recuperative thickening (rotary drum), and three without, had specific methanogenic activity tested in all related streams, including dewatering feed, cake, and centrate. All plants had high speed centrifuges for final dewatering. The microbial community was also assessed through 16 s Pyrotag sequencing. The activity of all samples was in the expected range of 0. 2 - 0. 4 gCOD gVS- 1 d- 1. Plants with recuperative thickening did not have lower digestate activity. Centrifuge based dewatering had a significant and variable impact on viability of methanogens from all samples, ranging between 20 % - 90 % decrease Recuperative thickening had a far smaller impact on activity, with a drop of 0 %- 20 % in activity. Principal components analysis of the microbial populations indicated that most populations were comparable, except that plants with recuperative thickening had a shift towards hydrogen utilising methanogens from aceticlastic methanogens. Further analysis indicated that the drop in activity was correlated with both niche microbial community (represented by principal component 3), and with final cake solids.

This part of the study includes the examination of the feedstocks for the beneficiation plant. The ash, as produced by the plant, and that stored in the lower pond were examined. Filter media candidates were evaluated for dewatering the ultrafine ash (UFA) product. Media candidates were selected based on manufacturer recommendations and evaluated using standard batch filtration techniques. A final media was selected; 901 F, a multifilament polypropylene. While this media would provide adequate solids capture and cake moisture, the use of flocculants would be necessary to enable adequate filter throughput. Several flocculant chemistries were also evaluated and it was determined that polyethylene oxide (PEO) at a dosage of 5 ppm (slurry basis) would be the most suitable in terms of both settling rate and clarity. PEO was evaluated on a continuous vacuum filter using 901 F media.

The liquid is used for agriculture fertilizer and the <b>dry</b> <b>cake</b> is used as an aquatic feed additive. Six factors were studied to improve liquid extraction with mechanical expression using a fractional factorial design with two levels.

40|$|Precipitation {{of nickel}} and cobalt as a mixed {{hydroxide}} is an increasingly popular step {{used to produce}} an intermediate product in the processing of laterite ores. The main constituent of the precipitate is nickel at approximately 50 % of the solid w/w. The industrial precipitation of the mixed hydroxide is carried out with seeding and at elevated temperatures (50 °C) to ensure a filterable precipitate forms. Research was carried out last year at UQ investigating methods of {{improving the quality of}} the precipitate product. An observation was that at room temperature the mixed hydroxide precipitates as a voluminous green gel-like suspension. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the formation and properties of hydroxide “gels”, specifically focusing on nickel with mind to understanding the chemical, physical and thermodynamic properties of the “gel” and mixed hydroxide systems in general. This will be achieved by: • Collating the current knowledge regarding nickel hydroxide and gel-like precipitates and the factors affecting their formation. • Experimentally defining the physical, chemical and thermodynamic properties of the nickel hydroxide gel-like precipitates and investigating the factors affecting their formation. • Providing scoping and ground work for further research. Industrial mixed hydroxide precipitation is carried out in aqueous sulphate systems, so the scope of this investigation was limited to studying these simplified industry analogous systems. Literature pertaining to the nickel hydroxide “gel” is minimal, as previous research focuses on either the alpha- or beta-phase crystalline precipitate in relation to its use in batteries. The alpha-phase is an irregularly layered, highly hydrated precipitate which is believed to decompose into the well orientated and layered precipitate beta-phase over time as the impurities are slowly occluded by the crystal structure. This study proposes that the nickel hydroxide “gel” precipitated at room temperature forms an amorphous, highly hydrated gel as defined by Stokes and Frith (2008) when in solution and once filtered it dehydrates to form a vitreous or glassy solid with no long range atomic structure. Calculations on the energy of formation for the amorphous precipitate show that it is less stable that crystalline nickel hydroxide with its energy of formation at - 443. 2 ± 2. 0 kJ/mol as opposed to crystalline form at - 453 kJ/mol. This indicates that the amorphous precipitate is a metastable phase with the crystalline form thermodynamically favourable but not achievable due to energy constrains. Equilibrium experiments showed that nickel hydroxide precipitates with between 10 and 25 % less than the stoichiometrically required amount of hydroxide however, month long experiments found the precipitate began to absorb in more hydroxide over time. Therefore the system was not fixed at a chemical equilibrium and may have been morph rearranging into the crystalline phase over the experimental time frame. Other precipitation system components significantly affected the precipitation thermodynamics of the amorphous precipitate. When separate, cobalt hydroxide will form at a slightly higher pH to nickel hydroxide but when cobalt is included in the nickel hydroxide precipitation system, the cobalt is stabilised to the solid phase at much lower pH values. When the nickel and cobalt hydroxide precipitate was filtered, it formed a cake approximately 3 times larger than the combined volume of the individual nickel and cobalt hydroxide precipitates. Within the aqueous sulphate system the amorphous nickel hydroxide has a hydration factor of approximately 200 - 300 water molecules per nickel hydroxide molecule. Once it is filtered the hydration drops to approximately 25 water molecules per nickel hydroxide molecule. Over time the filtered precipitate dehydrated further. When the <b>dry</b> <b>cake</b> was submerged in distilled water it was observed to shatter and eject shards approximately 1 mm diameter within the space of two minutes. Further research has also been proposed: • Longer term experiments are required to prove whether the amorphous precipitate was in fact decomposing into a more crystalline structure or simply shifting around within the bounds of the metastable phase. • XRD analysis is required to prove that the filtered precipitate is in a glassy state with no long range crystal structure. • Analysis on the gel inclusions is required to gain a greater understanding of the stability of different species within the gel and the attractive and repulsive forces during the formation of the gel...|$|E

In an ideal state, the dry solid produces contain 0 % water content; however,in an actual plant 0 % water content can never be achieved. On disposal, Kualiti Alam, a body appointed for disposalpurposes, will charge the <b>dried</b> <b>cake</b> sludge based on the weight, regardless water or dry solids. Therefore it is only sensibleto export the <b>dried</b> <b>cake</b> at maximum dryness. Suitable sludge management which includes preventive maintenance andoperating costs can reduce the overall process costs. This paper focuses on how cost and sludge management correlates andimprovement is practically seen on an actual implementation of this optimization. Factors {{that contributes to the}} overallSDP performance for parameter optimization for the SDP is identified through actual process data a capture from a lifeSDP plant and analysis as well as identification of the subsystems within the SDP itself...|$|R
