Through a quanto-qualitative analysis of articles taken from four publications: two daily newspapers, the Corriere della Sera from Italy and the New York Times from the United States and two science magazines, Science and Nature, we have shown how the aforementioned events provoked the emergence of media attention regarding bioterrorism. A closer reading of the articles shows that today, science – including that found in science magazines – is closely related to politics, economics and the debate over the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> practice <b>communicate.</b> The very mechanisms of communication between scientists were changed as a result of this debate, as can be seen from the signing of the Denver Declaration in February 2003, which brought about the preventative self-censorship of publication of biomedical research findings...|$|R

50|$|In another study, {{researchers}} {{aimed to}} identify the contradictions that were perceived by stepchildren when characterizing the ways that familial interactions caused them to feel {{caught in the middle}} between parents. The participants expressed that they wanted to be centered in the family while, at the same time, they hoped to avoid being {{caught in the middle of}} two opposing parents. The main contradiction identified in the study was similar to the autonomy-connection dialectic; stepchildren desired the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> and enact the desired relationship with their parents. However, these stepchildren also felt the need to manage the constraints that resulted from parental communication, particularly when both parents did not cooperate with one another. While the stepchildren wanted to know what was happening, at the same time, they also wanted to be protected, resulting in a second dialectic of control-restraint. Participants indicated that in order to put the child's needs first, both parents would need to be mature and open in their communication with one another. Through this study, the researchers believe that openness-closeness dialectic between parents and their children is important to building functional stepfamily relationships.|$|E

Additionally, the ALHR contended the Bill infringes other human rights not acknowledged in the Memorandum, in particular, the right to be treated with dignity (Article 1, Universal Declaration of Human Rights), freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home or correspondence (Article 12, Universal Declaration of Human Rights). The ALHR also submitted the Bill was likely <b>to</b> chill <b>freedom</b> of association (Articles 21 and 22, ICCPR and Article 20, Universal Declaration of Human Rights), the right to free development of one’s personality (Article 22, Universal Declaration of Human Rights), the right {{to take part in the}} conduct of public affairs (Article 25, ICCPR), and press <b>freedoms.</b> According <b>to</b> ALHR, the Bill would restrict free speech, as Australians would not know what information about them, including information about their contacts, might be shared among government (and non-government) bodies. Similarly, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights argued that, although the data retention regime pursues a legitimate objective, the scheme's proportionality is questionable and it may have a ‘chilling’ effect on people’s <b>freedom</b> and willingness <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> via telecommunications services because people will ‘self-censor’ views expressed via telecommunications services.

Although the internet offers new <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate,</b> it also provokes new problems such as the lack {{of control over the}} content. The article analyses how the internal regulatory structures of the providers are configured to enable an accountable use of the services. Here, the internal regulation of three social media providers is examined. Two aspects are relevant: The rules of the providers and the status of users. The results of the analysis propose a fragmented regulatory structure and divergence between the ideological postulates of excessive participation with social media providers and the de facto existing opportunities for participation of users in shaping the rules. As the results show, a concept of regulated self-regulation is necessary that establishes a culture of responsibility...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} {{economy and}} knowledge society {{depend on the}} development of networks of communications in terms of both physical possibilities of national and international infrastructure, and the inclination of individuals to participate in these. The rapid spread of such technical capacity, and the rise of wireless methods of communications enables many countries that might previously have been prevented from developing such an infrastructure to rapidly develop capacity. This physical development has reduced the costs of communications and consequently information, as well as the <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> internationally and, implicitly, inter-culturally. It is also recognised, however, that a range of social and economic factors influence the attitudes of individuals towards such communication, and also the possibilities of collective action both within and across nations, depending on the economic and social costs and ‘payoffs’ of such activities. The growth of low-cost information provision and low-cost international communications using the internet has raised the potential benefits of such facilities so that it is changing much of the nature of economic interaction in modern, as well as more traditional societies. Whether or not it will demonstrate a similar significance for the development of an information society remains to be seen, but parallels can be drawn between such changes and the existing analysis of networks, organisations and political ‘collective action’ from the grass roots level. Networks form a significant complement to the existing media that are also seizing on the potential of this modern technology, and constitute a source of general, or more specifically valuable information to individuals in society. ...|$|E

While the motivations for regulation are diverse, in their desire to censor Internet content, English-speaking countries have {{tended to focus on}} the moral implications of unfettered communication between computer users. Issues associated with intellectual property protection, harassment, and criminality following behind initial policy positions aimed, largely, at pornography and other morally-unacceptable forms of communication. In Australia, initial policy debates about Internet content focused almost exclusively on pornography and paedophilia, focusing on conflict between the protection of minors from offensive and morallydegrading material and the <b>freedom</b> of adults <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> content of interest to them. In 1999, the Federal Government introduced the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Act prohibiting the unrestricted distribution of material that would be classified 'R' or greater under the existing film and literature classification regime. In 2000, following public debate about the extent of gambling in the Australian community, the government introduced a moratorium on the expansion of online gambling services in Australia, followed in July 2001 by the Interactive Gambling Act to prohibit the operation of online casinos within Australia.
