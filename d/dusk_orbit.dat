50|$|The {{satellite}} design {{will make}} use of a large deployable mesh antenna and will operate on dual L band and S band. The 12-meter aperture mesh reflector will be supplied by Astro Aerospace, a Northrop Grumman company.The satellite will be launched from India aboard an Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle. The satellite will be 3-axis stabilised and is planned to be launched into a Sun-synchronous dawn to <b>dusk</b> <b>orbit</b> with a mission life of 3 years. The project has passed {{the first stage of}} the design validation phase and has been reviewed and approved by NASA.|$|E
50|$|On October 30, 1979 Magsat was {{launched}} from pad SLC-5 at Vandenberg AFB in California on a Scout II (101) rocket bearing 97° in a <b>dusk</b> to dawn <b>orbit.</b> The spacecraft {{was placed in}} an orbit with a perigee of 350 km and an apogee of 550 km. After reaching orbit, its telescoping boom was extended outward by 6 m. Two star cameras were used to define {{the position of the}} spacecraft relative to Earth. The orbit allowed the satellite to map a majority of the Earth's surfaces except the geographic poles. The satellite decayed from orbit on June 11, 1980.|$|R

(1995) {{reported}} that compressional Pi 3 pulsations excited near the dayside magnetopause by small scale solar wind dynamic pressure variations propagate faster {{to the morning}} than to the afternoon in the magnetosphere (see Fig.  7 in their study). They observed[*]~[*] 2 -min time lag between noon and <b>dusk</b> near geosynchronous <b>orbit,</b> corresponding to an average fast mode wave front velocity of[*]~[*] 350  km/s. Since this value is {{much smaller than the}} equatorial Alfvén velocity of[*]~[*] 1100 – 1700  km/s estimated in the prenoon sector (MLT[*]=[*] 09 – 12) by Takahashi and Anderson (1992), Matsuoka et al. (1995) did not consider the observed 2 -min time lag as fast mode propagation time near geosynchronous <b>orbit</b> in the <b>dusk</b> sector and suggested that the Pi 3 pulsations propagating duskward are launched at the magnetopause at some point away from the subsolar point. In the present study, we show a strong dawn–dusk asymmetry in VA. As mentioned above, the low VA region in the dusk–afternoon sector is associated with the plasmaspheric bulge. Since this region is populated with cold plasma, the Alfvén velocity is a good approximation to the fast mode velocity in the plasmaspheric bulge. Thus, the fast mode velocity of[*]~[*] 350  km/s near geosynchronous <b>orbit</b> in the <b>dusk</b> sector is not an unreasonable value as shown in Fig.  5.|$|R
40|$|During {{its three}} month long {{technology}} validation mission, Space Technology 5 (ST- 5) returned high quality multi-point {{measurements of the}} near-Earth magnetic field. Its three micro-satellites were launched into a 300 x 4500 km, dawn - <b>dusk,</b> sun synchronous <b>orbit</b> (inclination = 105. 60) orbit with a period of 138 min by a Pegasus launch vehicle on March 22, 2006. The spacecraft were maintained in a "pearls on a sting" constellation with controlled spacings ranging from just over 5000 km down to under 50 km. The individual micro-satellites were 48 cm tall octagons with diameters of 50 cm. They were spin-stabilized at approximately 20 rpm at deployment and slowly spun-down to about 15 rpm {{by the end of}} the mission. Each spacecraft carried a miniature tri-axial fluxgate magnetometer (MAG) provided by the University of California at Los Angeles mounted at the end of a ultra-low mass 72 cm boom. These data allow, for the first time, the separation of temporal and spatial variations in field-aligned current (FAC) perturbations measured in low-Earth orbit on time scales of 10 sec to 10 min. The constellation measurements are used to directly determine field-aligned current sheet motion, thickness. and current density. Two multi-point methods for the inference of FAC current density that have not previously been possible in low-Earth orbit are demonstrated: 1) the -standard method. " based upon s/c velocity, but corrected for FAC current sheet motion. and 2) the "gradiometer method" which uses simultaneous magnetic field measurements at two points with known separation. Future studies will apply these methods to the entire ST- 5 data sct and expand to include horizontal ionospheric currents. ULF waves and geomagnetic field gradient analyses...|$|R
5000|$|K-PAX {{is seated}} {{far from the}} two stars it orbits: K-MON and K-RIL. Thus, K-PAXians {{experience}} an eternal <b>dusk</b> as K-PAX <b>orbits</b> in a helix around the two celestial bodies. These stars are also not like the Sun {{because they are not}} main sequence stars. From the descriptions in the novel it is assumed that they are protostars nearing their inevitable collapse. The constant phase shift of light on K-PAX and the lack of light made it necessary to evolve the ability to detect shorter wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, i.e., ultraviolet. This explains prot's need to wear his sunglasses in all but very dim conditions. In the book, when Prot is questioned as to why a K-PAXian appears human on Earth, he responds, [...] "Why is a soap bubble round?" [...] He explains that K-PAXians appear human because the humanoid form is the most efficient shape to explore the planet. The method of reproduction of the dremers (prot's species, a term used in the book), unlike human sexual intercourse, is considered extremely unpleasant, due to intense feelings of pain and horrible smells, among other unpleasant sensations. Prot is completely uninterested in flirtation. Prot can age to a thousand years, like his parents, who are in their late six-hundreds. Prot's age contributes to his knowledge base, and on Earth, prot is considered a savant, although it is never specified whether dremer intelligence is inherent or a result of K-PAXian society. Prot makes it clear that dremers make every attempt to improve and disseminate their understanding of truth. Prot ultimately communicates that sentient beings on K-PAX have such a universal awareness of life that it would seem a majority of human endeavor is benign, but he is excited for us because our race has a bright future if only we disregard our primitive misconceptions of our surroundings.|$|R
