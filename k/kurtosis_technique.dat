40|$|Application of speckle {{variance}} {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) to endovascular imaging faces {{difficulty of}} extensive motion artifacts inherently associated with arterial pulsations {{in addition to other}} physiological movements. In this study, we employed a technique involving a fourth order statistical method, kurtosis, operating on the endovascular OCT intensity images to visualize the vasa vasorum of carotid artery in vivo and identify its flow dynamic in a porcine model. The intensity <b>kurtosis</b> <b>technique</b> can distinguish vasa vasorum from the surrounding tissues in the presence of extensive time varying noises and dynamic motions of the arterial wall. Imaging of vasa vasorum and its proliferation, may compliment the growing knowledge of structural endovascular OCT in assessment and treatment of atherosclerosis in coronary and carotid arteries...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the novel}} wavelet {{spectral}} kurtosis (WSK) technique is {{applied for the}} early diagnosis of gear tooth faults. Two variants of the wavelet spectral <b>kurtosis</b> <b>technique,</b> called variable resolution WSK and constant resolution WSK, are considered for the diagnosis of pitting gear faults. The gear residual signal, obtained by filtering the gear mesh frequencies, is used as the input to the SK algorithm. The advantages of using the wavelet-based SK techniques when compared to classical Fourier transform (FT) -based SK is confirmed by estimating the toothwise Fisher's criterion of diagnostic features. The final diagnosis decision is made by a three-stage decision-making technique based on the weighted majority rule. The probability of the correct diagnosis is estimated for each SK technique for comparison. An experimental study is presented in detail to test {{the performance of the}} wavelet spectral kurtosis techniques and the decision-making technique...|$|E
40|$|Diffusion {{kurtosis}} imaging (DKI) is {{an extension}} of the popular diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique. DKI takes into account leading deviations from Gaussian diffusion stemming from a number of effects related to the microarchitecture and compartmentalization in biological tissues. DKI therefore offers increased sensitivity to subtle microstructural alterations over conventional diffusion imaging such as DTI, as has been demonstrated in numerous reports. For this reason, interest in routine clinical application of DKI is growing rapidly. In an effort to facilitate more widespread use of DKI, recent work by our group has focused on developing experimentally fast and robust estimates of DKI metrics. A significant increase in speed is made possible by a reduction in data demand achieved through rigorous analysis of the relation between the DKI signal and the kurtosis tensor based metrics. The fast DKI methods therefore need only 13 or 19 images for DKI parameter estimation compared to more than 60 for the most modest DKI protocols applied today. Closed form solutions also ensure rapid calculation of most DKI metrics. Some parameters can even be reconstructed in real time, which may be valuable in the clinic. The fast techniques are based on conventional diffusion sequences and are therefore easily implemented on almost any clinical system, in contrast to a range of other recently proposed advanced diffusion techniques. In addition to its general applicability, this also ensures that any acceleration achieved in conventional DKI through sequence or hardware optimization will also translate directly to fast DKI acquisitions. In this review, we recapitulate the theoretical basis for the fast <b>kurtosis</b> <b>techniques</b> and their relation to conventional DKI. We then discuss the currently available variants of the fast <b>kurtosis</b> <b>techniques,</b> their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their respective realms of application. These range from whole body applications to methods mostly suited for spinal cord or peripheral nerve, and analysis specific to brain white matter. Having covered these technical aspects, we proceed to review the fast kurtosis literature including validation studies, organ specific optimization studies and results from clinical applications...|$|R

In this paper, we show how to price basket options when the underlying asset prices follow a displaced log-normal process with jumps, capable of accommodating negative skewness and excess <b>kurtosis.</b> Our <b>technique</b> involves Hermite polynomial expansion that can match exactly the first m moments of the model-implied basket return. This method is shown to provide superior results for basket options not only with respect to pricing but also for hedging...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhen {{modelling}} the behaviour of horticultural products, demonstrating large {{sources of}} biological variation, we often {{run into the}} issue of non-Gaussian distributed model parameters. This work presents an algorithm to reproduce such correlated non-Gaussian model parameters for use with Monte Carlo simulations. The algorithm works around the problem of non-Gaussian distributions by transforming the observed non-Gaussian probability distributions using a proposed SKN-distribution function before applying the covariance decomposition algorithm to generate Gaussian random co-varying parameter sets. The proposed SKN-distribution function {{is based on the}} standard Gaussian distribution function and can exhibit different degrees of both skewness and <b>kurtosis.</b> This <b>technique</b> is demonstrated using a case study on modelling the ripening of tomato fruit evaluating the propagation of biological variation with time...|$|R
40|$|Wheel-bearings easily acquire defects due {{to their}} {{high-speed}} operating conditions and constant metal-metal contact, so defect detection is of great importance for railroad safety. The conventional spectral <b>kurtosis</b> (SK) <b>technique</b> provides an optimal bandwidth for envelope demodulation. However, this technique may cause false detections when processing real vibration signals for wheel-bearings, because of sparse interference impulses. In this paper, a novel defect detection method with entropy, time-spectral kurtosis (TSK) and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. In this method, the possible outliers {{in the short time}} Fourier transform (STFT) amplitude series are first estimated and preprocessed with information entropy. Then the method extends the SK technique to the time-domain, and extracts defective frequencies from reconstructed vibration signals by TSK filtering. Finally, the multi-class SVM was applied to classify bearing defects. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using real wheel-bearing vibration signals. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides a better performance in defect frequency detection and classification than the conventional SK-based envelope demodulation...|$|R
40|$|We apply two {{distinct}} nonlinear <b>techniques,</b> <b>kurtosis</b> and phase coherence index, {{to analyze the}} modulus of interplanetary magnetic field data | B | measured by Cluster and ACE spacecraft from 1 to 3 February 2002. High degree of phase synchronization is found across {{a wide range of}} time scales, from 1 s to 10 4 s, in the magnetic field fluctuations, both in the shocked solar wind upstream of Earth's bow shock and in the unshocked ambient solar wind at the L 1 Lagrangian point. This is the first direct measurement of phase coherence in the ambient solar wind turbulence. We show that phase synchronization related to nonlinear multiscale interactions is the origin of the departure from Gaussianity in the intermittent magnetic field turbulence. In particular, we demonstrate that at small scales near the spectral break the intermittency level of Cluster is lower than ACE, which may be a signature of the reflected ions from the shock...|$|R

40|$|Myofascial pain, {{presented}} as myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) -related pain, is a common, chronic disease involving skeletal muscle, but its underlying mechanisms have been poorly understood. Previous studies {{have revealed that}} chronic pain can induce microstructural abnormalities in the cerebral gray matter. However, it remains unclear whether the brain gray matter of patients with chronic MTrPs-related pain undergo alteration. In this study, we employed the Diffusion <b>Kurtosis</b> Imaging (DKI) <b>technique,</b> which is particularly sensitive to brain microstructural perturbation, to monitor the MTrPs-related microstructural alterations in brain gray matter of patients with chronic pain. Our results revealed that, {{in comparison with the}} healthy controls, patients with chronic myofascial pain exhibited microstructural abnormalities in the cerebral gray matter and these lesions were mainly distributed in the limbic system and the brain areas involved in the pain matrix. In addition, we showed that microstructural abnormalities in the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) had a significant negative correlation with the course of disease and pain intensity. The results of this study demonstrated {{for the first time that}} there are microstructural abnormalities in the brain gray matter of patients with MTrPs-related chronic pain. Our findings may provide new insights into the future development of appropriate therapeutic strategies to this disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{coupling}} of kurtosis based-indexes and envelope analysis {{represents one}} of the most successful and widespread procedures for the diagnostics of incipient faults on rolling element bearings. Kurtosis-based indexes are often used to select the proper demodula- tion band for the application of envelope-based <b>techniques.</b> <b>Kurtosis</b> itself, in slightly different formulations, is applied for the prognostic and condition monitoring of rolling element bearings, as a standalone tool for a fast indication of the development of faults. This paper shows for the first time the strong analytical connection which holds for these two families of indexes. In particular, analytical identities are shown for the squared envelope spectrum (SES) and the kurtosis of the corresponding band-pass filtered analytic signal. In particular, it is demonstrated how the sum of the peaks in the SES corresponds to the raw 4 th order moment. The analytical results show as well a link with an another signal processing technique: the cepstrum pre-whitening, recently used in bearing diagnostics. The analytical results are the basis for the discussion on an optimal indicator for the choice of the demodulation band, the ratio of cyclic content (RCC), which endows the kurtosis with selectivity in the cyclic frequency domain and whose performance is compared with more traditional kurtosis-based indicators such as the protrugram. A benchmark, performed on numerical simulations and experimental data coming from two different test-rigs, proves the superior effectiveness of such an indicator. Finally a short introduction to the potential offered by the newly proposed index in the field of prognostics is given in an additional experimental example. In particular the RCC is tested on experimental data collected on an endurance bearing test-rig, showing its ability to follow the development of the damage with a single numerical index...|$|R
