2500|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) is {{a family}} of <b>electrokinetic</b> separation methods performed in submillimeter diameter capillaries and in micro- and nanofluidic channels. Very often, CE refers to capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), but other electrophoretic techniques including capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE), capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF), capillary isotachophoresis and micellar <b>electrokinetic</b> chromatography (MEKC) belong also to this class of methods. In CE methods, analytes migrate through electrolyte solutions {{under the influence of}} an electric field. Analytes can be separated according to ionic mobility and/or partitioning into an alternate phase via non-covalent interactions. Additionally, analytes may be concentrated or [...] "focused" [...] by means of gradients in conductivity and pH.|$|E
2500|$|The {{instrumentation}} {{needed to}} perform capillary electrophoresis is relatively simple. [...] A basic schematic of a capillary electrophoresis system {{is shown in}} figure 1. [...] The system's main components are a sample vial, source and destination vials, a capillary, electrodes, [...] a high voltage power supply, a detector, and a data output and handling device. The source vial, destination vial and capillary are filled with an electrolyte such as an aqueous buffer solution. [...] To introduce the sample, the capillary inlet is placed into a vial containing the sample. [...] Sample is introduced into the capillary via capillary action, pressure, siphoning, or electrokinetically, and the capillary is then returned to the source vial. [...] The migration of the analytes is initiated by an electric field that is applied between the source and destination vials and is supplied to the electrodes by the high-voltage power supply. [...] In the most common mode of CE, all ions, positive or negative, are pulled through the capillary in the same direction by electroosmotic flow. [...] The analytes separate as they migrate due to their electrophoretic mobility, and are detected near the outlet end of the capillary. The output of the detector is sent to a data output and handling device such as an integrator or computer. The data is then displayed as an electropherogram, which reports detector response as a function of time. Separated chemical compounds appear as peaks with different retention times in an electropherogram. [...] Capillary electrophoresis was first combined with mass spectrometry by Richard D. Smith and coworkers, and provides extremely high sensitivity for the analysis of very small sample sizes. [...] Despite the very small sample sizes (typically only a few nanoliters of liquid are introduced into the capillary), high sensitivity and sharp peaks are achieved in part due to injection strategies that result in concentration of analytes into a narrow zone near the inlet of the capillary. [...] This is achieved in either pressure or <b>electrokinetic</b> injections simply by suspending the sample in a buffer of lower conductivity (e.g. lower salt concentration) than the running buffer. [...] A process called field-amplified sample stacking (a form of isotachophoresis) results in concentration of analyte in a narrow zone at the boundary between the low-conductivity sample and the higher-conductivity running buffer.|$|E

50|$|The fluid {{flows in}} {{microfluidic}} and nanofluidic devices are often stable and strongly damped by viscous forces (with Reynolds numbers of order unity or smaller).

50|$|The {{dominant}} {{application of}} the electroseismic method is to measure the <b>electrokinetic</b> effect or streaming potential (item 2, above). <b>Electrokinetic</b> effects are initiated by sound waves (typically P-waves) passing through a porous rock inducing relative motion of the rock matrix and fluid. Motion of the ionic fluid through the capillaries in the rock occurs with cations (or less commonly, anions) preferentially adhering to the capillary walls, so that applied pressure and resulting fluid flow relative to the rock matrix produces an electric dipole. In a non-homogeneous formation, the seismic wave generates an oscillating flow of fluid and a corresponding oscillating electrical and EM field.
