40|$|High {{frequency}} {{transfer and}} elimination of drug resistance may indicate an <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>inheritance</b> of genetic determi-nants. This study shows the cure and transfer {{of a small}} plasmid and tetracycline resistance in Staphylococcus aureus 1030 (55) TetR strains. Several methods are available for plasmid elimination. We used ethidium bromide, an agent that binds to DNA, and thus inhibits DNA polymerase. This caused a high frequency of loss of the small plasmid and resistance to tetracycline. Transfer of tetracycline resistance was done in a mixed culture at a frequency of 10 - 6 •This type of study {{is very important to}} physicians and epidemiology investigators and provides better knowledge on antibiotic-resistance mechanisms that may occur in vivo in a hospital environment.

40|$|Virtually {{all known}} cases of <b>extrachromosomal</b> <b>{{inheritance}}</b> involve cytoplasmic inheritance through the maternal line. Recently, a paternally transmitted factor {{that causes the}} production of all-male families has been discovered in a parasitic wasp. The wasp has haplodiploid sex determination: male offspring are haploid and usually develop from unfertilized eggs, whereas females are diploid and usually develop from fertilized eggs. It has been postulated that this paternal sex-ratio factor (psr) is either (1) an infectious agent (a venereal disease) that is transmitted to the female reproductive tract during copulation with an infected male and, subsequently, causes all-male families or (2) a male cytoplasmic factor that is transmitted by sperm to eggs upon egg fertilization and, somehow, causes loss of the paternal set of chromosomes. —Experimental evidence is presented which shows that the factor requires egg fertilization for transmission to the next generation; therefore, {{it is likely to}} be a cytoplasmic factor. Significant potential intragenomic conflict results from the presence of this factor and two other sex-ratio distorters in this wasp species...|$|E
40|$|A {{strain of}} Neurospora crassa {{containing}} a cytoplasmic mutation (poky) affecting mitochondrial function {{is shown to}} be deficient in small ribosomal subunits in the mitochondrion during the exponential growth phase. In the stationary growth phase, small subunits are more abundant and are present in mitochondrial ribosomal monomers. This change can be correlated {{with the return of}} mitochondrial cytochrome content to amounts approaching those of wild type mitochondria. The ribosomal defect shows an <b>extrachromosomal</b> pattern of <b>inheritance</b> in crosses of poky with wild type...|$|R
40|$|Plasmids are {{units of}} <b>extrachromosomal</b> genetic <b>inheritance</b> {{found in all}} kingdoms of life. They {{replicate}} autonomously and undergo stable propagation in their hosts. Despite their small size, plasmid replication and gene expression constitute a metabolic burden that compromises their stable maintenance in host cells. This pressure has driven the evolution of strategies to increase plasmid stability—a process accelerated by the ability of plasmids to transfer horizontally between cells and to exchange genetic material with their host and other resident episomal DNAs. These abilities drive the adaptability and diversity of plasmids and their host cells. Indeed, survival functions found in plasmids have chromosomal homologues that have {{an essential role in}} cellular responses to stress. An analysis of these functions in the prokaryotic plasmid R 1, and of their intricate interrelationships, reveals remarkable overall similarities with other gene- and cell-survival strategies found within and beyond the prokaryotic world...|$|R
