40|$|The {{social and}} feeding {{behaviours}} of sheep and cattle segregated {{according to whether}} they had horns were investigated during live shipment, {{to determine the effects}} of mixing animals with and without horns within specification. Two voyages, one each of Merino sheep and Bos indicus-cross cattle, were monitored using video surveillance and retrospective analysis of footage from specific times to determine the number of behavioural interactions and feeding events within two pens each of polled, horned (up to one full curl in sheep or 12 cm in cattle), and mixed polled and horned animals. Concurrently, shipboard personnel recorded behaviour, daily feed intake, daily injury, death and disease of these animals. There was no evidence from the video footage that mixing polled and horned animals within specification resulted in negative health or behaviour outcomes for these animals. This was also the conclusion from the real-time observations made by shipboard personnel, although there were some differences in absolute number of interactions recorded by the two methods. Further observational studies of similar design were conducted on 15 short haul cattle voyages with shipboard personnel recording behaviour, daily feed intake, injury and death of animals in the <b>experimental</b> <b>pens.</b> Eleven of these voyages yielded usable data for analysis, and there was no indication from the records of any difference between <b>experimental</b> <b>pens...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} multienzyme complex containing protease and carbohydrase enzymes on the performance and nutrient digestibility of broiler chickens under different rearing conditions from 1 to 42 d of age. Two experimental starter and finisher wheat-soybean meal based diets were used in a two-phase feeding programme, as follows: control diet (C); control diet plus 0. 05 % multienzyme complex of protease and carbohydrase enzymes (Allzyme Vegpro) (VP). At location 1, broilers were raised in battery cages located in an <b>experimental</b> <b>pen,</b> without contact with litter. At location 2, broilers were raised in floor pens built in a commercial farm, and had contact with litter. At location 3, broilers were raised in commercial farms. In general, no differences in growth performance, feed intake or feed conversion ratio were observed in broiler chickens fed on the different diets at location 1. Only, the average daily feed intake from 22 to 42 d was significantly higher in the VP group compared with the C treatment (P< 0. 01). In addition, the final body weight of the VP group was numerically greater than that of the birds fed with the control diet, although the inclusion of the multienzyme complex did not cause significant effects. However, the ileal digestibilities of dry matter and crude protein were enhanced (P< 0. 05) by VP in the case of broilers in floor pens (+ 2. 5 % and + 2. 7 % for DM and CP, respectively) and in the commercial farm (+ 4. 4 % and + 6 % for the DM and CP, respectively) at 42 d of age, as well as faecal digestibity of the VP diet in <b>experimental</b> <b>pen.</b> It seemed that the effectiveness of the multienzyme complex on digestibility was higher when conditions of hygiene were poorer and stress was frequent. Based on {{the results of this study}} it can be concluded that the multienzyme complex of protease and carbohydrase enzymes might be effective for improving nutrient digestibility in broilers fed with a wheat-soybean meal based diet under commercial farm conditions...|$|E

Birds were allotted to 4 treatments containing 0, 150 mg vitamin C, 150 mg vitamin E, and 150 mg vitamin C plus 150 mg vitamin E/kg feed. Each treatment was replicated four times. The exposure of layers to 31 ± 3 °C and 33 ± 0 °C ambient temperature and 84. 6 % and 81. 5 % relative humidity, inside and outside the <b>experimental</b> <b>pen,</b> during the study period caused an increase in temperature humidity index 15. 5 above the threshold value of 70 established for this species.

A number of ninety day-old commercial broiler chicks (Habbard) were randomly allocated to nine <b>experimental</b> <b>pens,</b> of one square meter area each, located in an open deep litter experimental house. Three experimental diets were formulated from the common local feed ingredients used in poultry feeding in the Sudan, and used in the trial. One diet served as a control diet without addition of lipid, a second diet was supplemented with 5 % groundnut oil, and the third diet with 5 % beef tallow. The experimental diets were randomized to the <b>experimental</b> <b>pens</b> {{at the rate of}} three replicates per treatment, in a completely randomized design arrangement. Incorporation of beef tallow in the diet resulted in improved chick performance compared to the other experimental diets. The birds fed the beef tallow supplemented diet had a significantly higher feed and essential nutrients consumption (P< 0. 01) than the birds fed either of the two other experimental diets. This effect is related to improved palatability of beef tallow, and partially to the presence of increased saturated fatty acids, contributed by beef tallow in the diet. These effects resulted in improved growth rate and body weight gain, efficient feed conversion ratio and increased abdominal fat deposition in the birds fed the tallow diet.

30|$|A {{long-term}} {{study of}} possible high voltage transmission line effects on sheep was initiated in 1990 by Bonneville Power Administration, Portland, Oregon. Results {{of the study}} were presented in a series of Reports, the last two of which were published by the Electric Power Research Institute, which sponsored Phases 4 and 5 of the study. Experimental animals were housed in a pen within a powerline corridor containing 3 x 500 [*]kV and 2 x 230 [*]kV transmission lines. Control animals were some 230 [*]m distant. Phases 2 and 3 of the study found that activity of the cytokine IL- 1 was significantly reduced in experimental animals but removing the animals from exposure conditions resulted in a return of cytokine activity to control levels (see Sidaway 2012). The Phase 2 Report (Stormshak 1993) contains (otherwise unavailable) information regarding possible immune dysfunction associated with the development of fungal skin infections in sheep exposed to the powerline environment. Two human infections also occurred in study personnel. These observations are clearly important as Chang et al. (2011) noted that childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia may be associated with a dysregulated immunefunction. Il- 1 has an important role in regulating defence mechanisms against pathogens including fungi (Ben-Sasson et al. 2009; Sims and Smith 2010). During Phases 4 and 5, a second <b>experimental</b> <b>pen</b> was added in which animals were shielded from the powerline electric field by grounded metal screens (see Sidaway 2012). A summary of parts of Reports 4 and 5 was published by Hefeneider et al, (Hefeneider et al. 2001) who noted a significant correlation between wind direction and IL- 1 activity. This would be consistent with the action of powerline-associated airborne bioactive agents.|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} {{the ecology of the}} poultry gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome and its interactions with the host, we compared GI bacterial communities by sample type (fecal or cecal), time (1, 3, and 6 weeks post-hatch), and <b>experimental</b> <b>pen</b> (1, 2, 3, or 4), and measured cecal mRNA transcription of the cytokines IL 18, IL 1 β, and IL 6, IL 10, and TGF-β 4. The microbiome was characterized by sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene amplicons, and cytokine gene expression was measured by a panel of quantitative-PCR assays targeting mRNAs. Significant differences were observed in the microbiome by GI location (fecal versus cecal) and bird age as determined by permutational MANOVA and UniFrac phylogenetic hypothesis tests. At 1 wk post-hatch, bacterial genera significantly over-represented in fecal versus cecal samples included Gallibacterium and Lactobacillus, while the genus Bacteroides was significantly more abundant in the cecum. By 6 wk post-hatch, Clostridium and Caloramator (also a Clostridiales) sequence types had increased significantly in the cecum and Lactobacillus remained over-represented in fecal samples. In the ceca, the relative abundance of sequences classified as Clostridium increased by ca. 10 -fold each sampling period from 0. 1 % at 1 wk, to 1 % at 3 wk, and 18 % at 6 wk. Increasing community complexity through time were observed in increased taxonomic richness and diversity. IL 18 and IL 1 β significantly (p< 0. 05, pairwise t-tests) increased to maximum mean expression levels 1. 5 fold greater at wk 3 than wk 1, while IL 6 significantly decreased to 0. 8 -fold and 0. 5 -fold expression at 3 wk and 6 wk post-hatch respectively relative to wk 1. Transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines was generally negatively correlated with the relative abundance of various members of the phylum Firmicutes and positively correlated with Proteobacteria. Correlations of the microbiome with specific cytokine mRNA transcription highlights the importance of the GI microbiome for bird health and productivity and may be a successful high-throughput strategy to identify bacterial taxa with specific immune-modulatory properties...|$|E

For a period of 8 weeks a familiar human (FH) subjected 22 Romane lambs to a gentling treatment based on strokes. At the age of 8 weeks each lamb {{was placed in the}} <b>experimental</b> <b>pen</b> and tested. Half of them received the gentling treatment (STROKE) for 8  min, and the others were simply exposed to the human presence for the same period of time (PRESENCE). Animals were equipped for heart rate recording and tests were video-recorded. These behavioural and heart rate variability data have been already published. A free choice profiling approach {{was used to}} instruct ten observers in qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA). Short video sequences of the tests were randomly presented and scored by the observers unaware of any information about the quantitative data recorded. QBA data were analysed using Generalised Procrustes Analysis (GPA). The GPA consensus profile explained a high percentage of variation among the 10 observers, and differed significantly from the mean randomised profile (P <  0. 001). The two main dimensions of the consensus profile explained 42, 3 % and 18, 0 % of variation between the tested lambs. All of the interpretation word charts were semantically consistent and oriented to the same meaning despite the use of different descriptors. The most used descriptors to label the first dimension was characterised by descriptors ranging from “curious” (positive end) to “relaxed” (negative end), whereas the second dimension ranged from “indifferent” (positive end) to “sociable” (negative end). Lambs from group PRESENCE received significantly higher scores than group STROKED on the Dimension 2 (χ 2  =  4. 49, P <  0. 05) and were therefore assessed as more indifferent. Conversely, the animals from group STROKED received significantly lower scores on Dimension 1, thus resulting more relaxed than group PRESENCE (χ 2  =  4. 48, P <  0. 05). A principal component analysis showed meaningful relationships between quantitative and qualitative variables with variables indicating relaxation and positive emotions displaying high loadings on the negative end of axis 1, whereas variables showing a low level of arousal but less positive emotions were more related with the positive end of axis 2. In this study QBA confirms previous interpretations from quantitative behavioural and physiological data.

This study aimed to evaluate the value of cardboard boxes as an environmental enrichment for commercially kept broiler chickens. Behaviour observations were conducted on two flocks of fast growing broilers in Farm 1 and one flock of slower growing broilers in Farm 2, at three different ages during the production cycle (3, 18 and 28 days, with additional observations in Farm 2 at 49 days). The houses were divided in quarters (Farm 1) or in half (Farm 2), and for each pair of adjacent pens, one {{was assigned to the}} experimental treatment containing cardboard boxes, and one to the control treatment. Instantaneous scans were performed to record the number of chickens standing (i. e. active) and lying (i. e. resting) on top of boxes (if present) and on the floor within observation patches. Three 10 -s scans were then conducted to record “positive welfare” behavioural events based on ethogram description, and a graded scale was used for each behaviour where 0 = no events observed in 10 -s, 1 = rare (one event observed in 10 s), 2 = occasional (2 - 3 events observed in 10 s), 3 = frequent (> 3 events observed in 10 s, involving > 3 birds). The chickens’ use of the box was assessed by counting the number of birds on top, beside and under 8 boxes per <b>experimental</b> <b>pen.</b> A novel object test was conducted to assess approach versus avoidance tendencies, and finally gait scores to assess lameness. Providing birds with cardboard boxes resulted in more playful behaviour such as running at 3 days of age (P= 0. 004) and jumping at 18 days of age (P= 0. 003) than in control pens, and more resting in patches containing a box than patches without a box in experimental pens (P= 0. 043).

40|$|A {{study in}} {{experimental}} slatted-system fattening pig units {{was conducted with}} the aim of estimating the odour emission factor (in ou/s. pig), which can subsequently be used in dispersion models to assess the odour annoyance zone. Dynamic olfactometry measurements carried out at different development stages of pigs showed a logical trend of the mean predicted odour emission factor with the pig weight. However, the variation within the same weight class was much larger than variation between classes. Possible causes of such variation were identified as the evolution of ventilation rate during the day and the circadian rhythm of pig. To be able to monitor continuously the daily variation of the odour, an electronic nose was used with suitable regression model calibrated against olfactometric measurements. After appropriate validation check, the electronic nose proved to be convenient, as a complementary tool to dynamic olfactometry, to record the daily variation of the odour emission factor in the pig barn. It was demonstrated that, in the controlled conditions of the <b>experimental</b> <b>pens,</b> the daily variation of the odour emission rate could be mainly attributed to the sole influence of the circadian rhythm of pig.

Approach: A trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of supplemental L-leucine in diets containing recommended levels and low crude protein (20 and 18 %, respectively) with constant metabolizable energy (3200 kcal kg - 1) for broilers from 21 - 42 day of age. Six experimental diets were formulated with three levels of supplemental L-leucine, 0, 0. 5 and 0. 67 % and two levels of crude protein. A total of 180 1 day-old Cobb broiler chickens were randomly divided into 36 <b>experimental</b> <b>pens,</b> 5 chickens in each pen, with each diet replicated 6 times. The dietary treatments were offered from 21 - 42 days of age. Feed intake, body weight gain and Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) were measured on a weekly basis.

40|$|Background: It is well {{established}} now that fat deposition is governed by the genetic, nutritional and management practices. However, most influenced agent in this respect is the nutritional factors mainly phase feeding. Objectives: This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of phase feeding diets (starter, grower and finisher) on broiler performance, serum-carcass cholesterol and fatty acids profile. Material and Methods: A number of 90 chicks (Ross 308) from the healthy and uniform chicks were selected and (Ross 308) reared for six weeks in deep litter open house and assigned randomly to the three dietary treatments each replicated three times (nine <b>experimental</b> <b>pens,</b> {{at the rate of}} ten chicks per pen). Treatment one consisted of one diet (starter) for all experimental period. Treatment two consisted of two diets (starter and grower) introduced three week for each. Treatment three consisted of three diets (starter, grower, finisher) each introduced for two weeks. Results: the phase feeding systems was significantly decreased the overall broiler performance, positive but insignificant effect on carcass parameters, provoked significant increase on liver, heart, and abdominal fat pad, and no significant effect on cholesterol and triglycerides of carcass, serum or abdominal fat pad was observed. Concussion: The phase feeding manipulation improved the carcass quality through elevating the cholesterol and triglycerides of the abdominal fat pad...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the effect of Probiotic supplementation and feed restriction on growth response in broiler chickens. For this purpose, 336 male broiler chickens of Ross 308 were used. After housing, broilers allocated to <b>experimental</b> <b>pens</b> in a completely randomized design with factorial 2 × 3 arrangement. First and second groups considered as positive control group with supplemented probiotic or negative control group without supplemented probiotic, respectively, that birds in these groups had free access to feed. Four other groups used a diet same as control groups, but from 7 to 35 days of age subjected to 4 or 8 hours feed restriction. Four replicates of 14 birds were allocated to each experimental group. Results of the experiment indicated the birds subjected to feed restriction had significantly lower feed intake and body weight gain {{during the first week}} of rearing compared to those fed ad-libitum. There was no significant difference between experimental treatments for feed intake. In the group of without probiotic, feed restriction for 8 hours led to reduce weight gain and carcass weight compare to those fed ad-libitum. But when use probiotic, weight gain and carcass weight was similar to those birds were fed ad-libitum. The results of this experiment showed that the use of probiotic can improve the performance of broilers under severe feed restriction...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} on two consecutive years to determine whether ovulatory activity can be induced in anovulatory goats by exposing them to sexually active bucks for 4, 8, 12 or 16 h per day during 15 consecutive days. In experiment 1, females remained continuously in the <b>experimental</b> <b>pens</b> where they were in contact with males. One group remained isolated from males (controls) and four other groups were exposed to sexually active males for 4, 8, 12 or 16 h per day. In experiment 2, females were taken away to "resting" pens free of male odours between the periods of contact with bucks. They were allocated to 5 groups as in experiment 1. Ovulations were determined by progesterone plasma levels and transrectal ultrasonography. Pregnancy was determined by abdominal ultrasonography. In both experiments, more than 90 % of females exposed to the bucks {{had at least one}} ovulation during the whole experiment whereas only 11 or 0 % (experiments 1 and 2, respectively) did so in the control group (P 0. 05). In both experiments, pregnancy rates were not affected by the daily duration of contact with males (P> 0. 05). To conclude, 4 h of daily contact with sexually active males is sufficient to stimulate ovulatory activity in anovulatory goats and this effect is not due to the presence of olfactory cues from the males remaining in the pens.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of sesame seeds meal {{as the sole}} vegetable protein supplement was studied to assess its feeding value for broiler chicks' growth. A 6 -weeks feeding trial was conducted with day- old broiler chicks (Ross), reared in <b>experimental</b> <b>pens</b> in an open deep litter house. Four experimental diets {{were used in the}} trial, which included a basal diet (diet 1) containing sesame meal as the sole vegetable protein supplement. This basal diet was supplemented with lysine, methionine or lysine plus methionine to produce diets 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The feeding trail was arranged {{in the form of a}} completely randomized block design, with three blocks and four <b>experimental</b> units (<b>pens)</b> per blocks, and each dietary treatment was replicated three times. Records were kept for weekly feed consumption, liveweight, feed conversion ratio and for final plucked and dressed carcass weights. The collected data was subjected to analyses of variance to find out any statistical differences among the dietary treatments. The results revealed clearly an inferior productive performance of the experimental chicks fed on the sesame-basal diet (diet 1), the methionine supplemented diet (diet 3) and the lysine+methionine vii i supplemented diet (diet 4). The performance was improved by supplementing the control sesame based diet with lysine alone. This indicates that sesame meal, as a sole vegetable protein supplement, is in adequate for broiler growth because of its short supply of lysine. The results also showed that the mean feed consumption was not significantly affected by the experimental diets, but it was markedly higher for the group of birds fed the lysine supplemented diet (diet 2). Final liveweight, plucked and dressed weights were also significantly increased by feeding (diet 2), and were reduced in the group of birds fed the methionine supplemented diet (diet 3). This latter group of birds had the highest feed conversion ratio, which was statistically different from the other dietary treatments. According to the results of the present study, it can be anticipated that, sesame seeds meal can be utilized effectively in broiler diets, to support satisfactory chicks' performance, provided the diet is supplemented with synthetic lysine to correct its deficiency in the sesame meal. Similarly lysine rich supplements can be combined with sesame meal supplement to correct for this amino acid deficiency and improve growth rate and feed utilization efficienc...|$|R
40|$|Published online: 17 Sep 2014 Predation by feral cats (Felis catus) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are key {{threatening}} {{processes for}} many endangered wildlife species. Toxin delivery through compulsive oral grooming {{is a potential}} mechanism to supplement existing control techniques for feral cats and red foxes, particularly when high prey densities reduce the uptake of toxic food baits by cats. We investigated the efficacy of different grooming traps by applying a gel containing toxic para-aminopropiophenone (PAPP) to the fur of feral cats and red foxes in <b>experimental</b> <b>pens.</b> Grooming behaviour and signs of poisoning in these animals were recorded by video. More cats interacted with “walk past” grooming traps triggered by sensor beams than with trap models that required the cat to enter a pipe or baited cage. After triggering a trap that had applied PAPP gel to their fur, 14 of 16 feral cats showed symptoms of anoxia, and 8 of these cats were dead by the following morning without exhibiting signs of distress. Seven of 12 foxes were observed to groom fur to which toxic gel had been applied and 3 of these ingested a lethal quantity of PAPP as a result. Our successful proof-of-concept trials support further development of grooming trap sensors and toxin delivery mechanisms to provide humane and targeted feral cat control, although this technique {{is unlikely to be}} as successful for fox control, given that foxes appear to not groom as fastidiously as cats.

40|$|Chewing and rooting {{are high}} {{behavioural}} priorities in pigs. Lack of suitable materials {{can lead to}} abnormal behaviours such as tail and ear biting. In commercial farming, slatted floors limit the use of straw, and various point-source objects have therefore been developed. The crucial challenge is to design objects that improve welfare at minimal material and labour costs. The {{aim of this study}} was to test three low-cost objects: branching metal chains, polythene pipe crosses and fresh wood. The study was carried out on undocked growing-finishing pigs on a commercial farm in Finland, housed on partly slatted floors in 10 -m 2 pens of 11 pigs. The total number of pigs at the time of data collection was 780, as the farmer had removed 23 of the original pigs due to tail biting. The control pens (N = 17) had a straw rack, a metal chain and a daily provision of wood shavings. The <b>experimental</b> <b>pens</b> had the same and one of the following: the wood pens (N = 14) had horizontally suspended pieces of fresh birch wood (Ø 10 cm), 30 cm per pig; the plastic pens (N = 13) had a cross of 60 -cm polythene pipes (Ø 5 cm), hanging from the ceiling; the branching-chain pens (N = 15) had two crosses of metal chains, suspended vertically; and the combination pens (N = 14) had all of the above.

40|$|Two {{field trials}} were {{conducted}} to assess locomotor problems in broilers. Males and females broilers were used from two commercial strains reared on two different litter materials, new and re-used. In the first experiment (E 1) rice husks and wood shavings were used as new litter, {{and in the second}} experiment (E 2) the same litter was re-used. A batch of one-day-old chicks (2968) was reared randomly distributed in <b>experimental</b> <b>pens,</b> in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial scheme (two genetic strains, two sexes and two litter materials). The same fodder and water were available to all birds ad libitum. Broilers locomotion problems were evaluated using the characteristics of gait score, incidence of valgus and varus, foot-pad lesions, degeneration, femoral, tibial dyschondroplasia, spondylolisthesis and breast calluses. The number of birds with high gait score was less than 30 % in the two experiments. Males presented higher gait score (GS) (28. 46 % GS 1 and 2 compared to females, 20. 98 %); greater incidence of angular deformities (26. 62 % with valgus compared to 14. 71 % of the female); and femoral degenerative joint lesions (70. 83 % in average, compared to 55. 16 % of the female), and the correlation between these traits varied from 0. 18 to 0. 87 (P< 0. 05). There was an increase of foot-pad lesions in re-used litter leading to poor welfare. The use of rice husks in deep litter for broiler production might be a viable alternative of wood shavings...|$|R

40|$|The {{acoustic}} target {{strength of}} adult cod (Gadus morhua) was measured ex situ in a large, 4500 m 3, <b>experimental</b> net <b>pen</b> at the IMR Austevoll aquaculture station in eight periods between November 1996 and May 1998. A calibrated Simrad EK 500 split beam echo sounder {{was used to}} collect the acoustic data from a vertically observing transducer, positioned {{in the middle of}} the 21 m deep net pen. Groups of about 20 individual cod were transferred from the control storage population in each measurement series, but moved in every other aspect freely within the <b>experimental</b> net <b>pen</b> during the acoustic measurements. Natural variations in gonadosomatic index as well as changes in condition factor from an enforced starvation was monitored and correlated with changes in target strength. A General Linear Model (GLM) was used to estimate the functional relationship between the target strength at 38 kHz and important biological parameters. The significant ones were: Condition factor (CI), Liver index (LI), the spread of the tilt angle distribution (SDTILT), while the gonadosomatic index (GSI) mean swimming angle (MT) and the swimbladder index (SI) was not significant. For cod between 50 and 60 cm size, the target strength relationship is suggested to be: = 20 log L – 64. 0 – 0. 099 (SDTILT) + 2. 44 (LI) – 1. 86 (CI), where the effect of tilt angle may be converted to a day/night effect. Under normal liver index and condition factor, the new mean target strength is slightly higher than the one used in the surveys, but correspond well to the experimental nighttime observations. The ex situ data are compared with recent in situ target strength measurements...|$|R

The trial was {{in the form of}} a completely randomized design. A number of 128 unsexed broiler chicks (Ross 308) were randomized in 16 pens of one square meter area each, in an open deep litter house, at the rate of 8 chicks per <b>pen.</b> Four <b>experimental</b> treatments, consisting of 4 levels of feed restriction, were allocated at random to the <b>experimental</b> <b>pens,</b> giving four replicates per treatment. An experimental standard broiler starter diet was formulated to meet the NRC (1994) nutrients requirements for the broiler chick. The diet was fed Adlibitum to a control group of chicks throughout the experimental period, and was restricted to 80, 70, or 60 % of the Adlibitum consumption of the control group of birds in the previous day. Feed restriction of the respective groups of birds continued for two weeks from 22 to 35 days of age; followed by Adlibitum refeeding for a period of two weeks from 36 to 49 days of age. Data was collected weekly for feed consumption, live weight gain, feed conversion ratio and daily mortality. At the end of the experiment, four birds from each treatment replicate were selected at random, and the birds selected were slaughtered and used to determine the mean dressing out percentage, fat pad weight, and viscera weight for each treatment. The collected data was subjected to analysis of variance to estimate any statistical differences among the experimental treatments. The results indicated a significant (P 0. 05) in the fat pad weight and viscera weight among the feed restricted birds and the birds that fed adlibitum...|$|R
