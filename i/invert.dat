40|$|BackgroundThe {{extracellular}} {{domains of}} cytokine receptors are released during inflammation, but {{little is known}} about the shedding of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and whether they can be used as diagnostic biomarkers. MethodsThe release of sTLR 2 and sTLR 4 was studied in in-vitro stimulations, as well as in-vivo during experimental human endotoxemia (n <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 11, 2 ng/kg LPS), and in plasma of 394 patients with infections (infectious mononucleosis, measles, respiratory tract infections, bacterial sepsis and candidemia) or non-infectious inflammation (Crohn <b>inverted</b> question marks disease, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, autoinflammatory syndromes and pancreatitis). Using C-statistics, the value of sTLR 2 and sTLR 4 levels for discrimination between infections and non-infectious inflammatory diseases, as well as between viral and bacterial infections was analyzed. ResultsIn-vitro, peripheral blood mononuclear cells released sTLR 2 and sTLR 4 by exposure to microbial ligands. During experimental human endotoxemia, plasma concentrations peaked after 2 hours (sTLR 4) and 4 hours (sTLR 2). sTLR 4 did not correlate with cytokines, but sTLR 2 correlated positively with TNF <b>inverted</b> question mark (rs <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 80, P <b>inverted</b> question mark< <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 05), IL- 6 (rs <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 65, P <b>inverted</b> question mark< <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 05), and IL- 1 Ra (rs <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 57, P <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 06), and negatively with IL- 10 (rs <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark- 0. 58, P <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 06), respectively. sTLR 4 had a similar area under the ROC curve [AUC] for differentiating infectious and non-infectious inflammation compared to CRP: 0. 72 (95 % CI 0. 66 - 0. 79) versus 0. 74 (95 % CI 0. 69 - 0. 80) [P <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 80], while sTLR 2 had a lower AUC: 0. 60 (95 % CI 0. 54 - 0. 66) [P <b>inverted</b> question mark= <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 0004]. CRP differentiated bacterial infections better from viral infections than sTLR 2 and sTLR 4 : AUC 0. 94 (95 % CI 0. 90 - 0. 96) versus 0. 58 (95 % CI 0. 51 - 0. 64) and 0. 75 (95 % CI 0. 70 - 0. 80), respectively [P <b>inverted</b> question mark< <b>inverted</b> question mark 0. 0001 for both].

5|$|The large {{spillway}} tunnels {{have only}} been used twice, for testing in 1941 and because of flooding in 1983. During both times, when inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used, engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock. The 1941 damage was attributed to a slight misalignment of the tunnel <b>invert</b> (or base), which caused cavitation, a phenomenon in fast-flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with explosive force. In response to this finding, the tunnels were patched with special heavy-duty concrete and {{the surface of the}} concrete was polished mirror-smooth. The spillways were modified in 1947 by adding flip buckets, which both slow the water and decrease the spillway's effective capacity, in an attempt to eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the 1941 damage. The 1983 damage, also due to cavitation, led to the installation of aerators in the spillways. Tests at Grand Coulee Dam showed that the technique worked, in principle.|$|E

40|$|<b>Inverted</b> duplications are {{a common}} type of copy number {{variation}} (CNV) in germline and somatic genomes. Large duplications that include many genes can lead to both neurodevelopmental phenotypes in children and gene amplifications in tumors. There are several models for <b>inverted</b> duplication formation, most of which include a dicentric chromosome intermediate followed by breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles, but the mechanisms {{that give rise to}} the <b>inverted</b> dicentric chromosome in most <b>inverted</b> duplications remain unknown. Here we have combined high-resolution array CGH, custom sequence capture, next-generation sequencing, and long-range PCR to analyze the breakpoints of 50 nonrecurrent <b>inverted</b> duplications in patients with intellectual disability, autism, and congenital anomalies.

Further, short <b>inverted</b> sequences are present at the boundary of the disomic spacer and the <b>inverted</b> duplication. These data support a mechanism of <b>inverted</b> duplication formation whereby a chromosome with a double-strand break intrastrand pairs with itself to form a "fold-back" intermediate that, after DNA replication, produces a dicentric <b>inverted</b> chromosome with a disomic spacer corresponding {{to the site of the}} fold-back loop.

40|$|<b>Inverted</b> repeats are {{important}} genetic elements for genome instability. In {{the current study}} we have investigated the role of <b>inverted</b> repeats in a DNA rearrangement reaction using a linear DNA substrate. We show that linear DNA substrates with terminal <b>inverted</b> repeats can efficiently transform Escherichia coli. The transformation products contain circular <b>inverted</b> dimers in which the DNA sequences between terminal <b>inverted</b> repeats are duplicated. In contrast to the recombination/rearrangement product of circular DNA substrates, which is exclusively one particular form of the <b>inverted</b> dimer, the rearrangement products of the linear DNA substrate consist of two isomeric forms of the <b>inverted</b> dimer. Escherichia coli mutants defective in RecBCD exhibit much reduced transformation efficiency, suggesting a role for RecBCD in the protection rather than destruction of these linear DNA substrates. These results suggest a model in which <b>inverted</b> repeats near the ends of a double-strand break can be processed by a helicase/exonuclease to form hairpin caps. Processing of hairpin capped DNA intermediates can then yield <b>inverted</b> duplications. Linear DNA substrates containing terminal <b>inverted</b> repeats can also be converted into <b>inverted</b> dimers in COS cells, suggesting conservation {{of this type of}} genome instability from bacteria to mammalian cells...|$|R
