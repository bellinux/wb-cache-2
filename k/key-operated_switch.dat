50|$|The {{starter motor}} is a series, compound, or {{permanent}} magnet type electric motor with a solenoid and solenoid operated switch mounted on it. When low-current {{power from the}} starting battery {{is applied to the}} starter solenoid, usually through a <b>key-operated</b> <b>switch,</b> the solenoid closes high-current contacts for the starter motor and it starts to run. Once the engine starts, the <b>key-operated</b> <b>switch</b> is opened and the solenoid opens the contacts to the starter motor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{electric}} starter motor or cranking motor {{is the most}} common type used on gasoline engines and small diesel engines. The modern starter motor is either a permanent-magnet or a series-parallel wound direct current electric motor with a starter solenoid (similar to a relay) mounted on it. When DC power from the starting battery is applied to the solenoid, usually through a <b>key-operated</b> <b>switch</b> (the [...] "ignition switch"), the solenoid engages a lever that pushes out the drive pinion on the starter driveshaft and meshes the pinion with the starter ring gear on the flywheel of the engine.|$|E
50|$|The solenoid also closes high-current {{contacts}} for {{the starter}} motor, which begins to turn. Once the engine starts, the <b>key-operated</b> <b>switch</b> is opened, a {{spring in the}} solenoid assembly pulls the pinion gear away from the ring gear, and the starter motor stops. The starter's pinion is clutched to its drive shaft through an overrunning sprag clutch which permits the pinion to transmit drive in only one direction. In this manner, drive is transmitted through the pinion to the flywheel ring gear, but if the pinion remains engaged (as for example because the operator fails to release the key {{as soon as the}} engine starts, or if there is a short and the solenoid remains engaged), the pinion will spin independently of its drive shaft. This prevents the engine driving the starter, for such backdrive would cause the starter to spin so fast as to fly apart.|$|E
50|$|Before Chrysler's 1949 {{innovation}} of the <b>key-operated</b> combination ignition-starter <b>switch,</b> {{the starter}} was {{operated by the}} driver pressing a button that was mounted on the floor or dashboard. This type of control has now returned {{with the use of}} keyless entry. Early Chevrolet cars had the starter pedal {{to the right of the}} accelerator, with a secondary throttle control knob on the dashboard because it was difficult to operate the starter pedal and the throttle pedal at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Before Chrysler's 1949 {{innovation}} of the <b>key-operated</b> combination ignition-starter <b>switch,</b> {{the starter}} was often {{operated by the}} driver pressing a button mounted on the floor or dashboard. Some vehicles had a pedal in the floor that manually engaged the starter drive pinion with the flywheel ring gear, then completed the electrical circuit to the starter motor once the pedal {{reached the end of}} its travel. Ferguson tractors from the 1940s, including the Ferguson TE20, had an extra position on the gear lever that engaged the starter switch, ensuring safety by preventing the tractors from being started in gear.|$|R
50|$|Fall 1994 {{production}} (1995 model year) {{included a}} steering wheel modified {{to include a}} drivers side airbag and a redesigned dashboard which included a double DIN radio head unit. Also for 1995 (model year), SuperCab trucks could have a power drivers seat. The A4LD transmission was updated. 2.3- and 3.0-liter models got the 4R44E, while 4.0-liter trucks got the 4R55E. The front brakes were changed {{to use the same}} two-piston brake calipers as the second-generation Explorer, and four-wheel anti-lock brakes were added as standard on 4x4 and 4.0-liter models. From October 1995 (1996 model year), an optional passenger airbag (the first compact truck to offer one) became available, with a <b>key-operated</b> cutoff <b>switch</b> that allowed the airbag to be turned off for smaller passengers riding in the front seat. In October 1996, the 1997 model year brought in the first ever five-speed automatic transmission to be used by an American manufacturer. The 4.0-liter models were equipped with the 5R55E, while the 3.0-liter was still mated to the 4R44E.|$|R
50|$|The second {{generation}} K5 models incorporated the rear hatch glass and tailgate {{into a single}} unit, which allowed the glass panel to retract inside of the tailgate by use of a manual crank mounted on the tailgate or an electric motor activated by a <b>key-operated</b> <b>switch</b> on the tailgate and a dash-mounted switch. The weight of the large glass panel was rumored to be a liability as the manual crank gears wore prematurely and the electric motor was prone to frequent overheating and subsequent failure. This also included the electric motor drive cable which goes to the window regulator to the motor (similar in design to a speedometer cable), which usually would fail under heavy abuse. Another feature of the K5 Blazer tailgate was the safety switch connected to the electric motor which prevented the rear window from being raised if the tailgate was unlatched.|$|E
