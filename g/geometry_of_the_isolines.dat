40|$|Effects {{of plant}} height on Fusarium crown rot (FCR) disease {{severity}} were investigated using 12 pairs of near-isogenic lines (NILs) for six different reduced height (Rht) genes in wheat. <b>The</b> dwarf <b>isolines</b> all gave better FCR resistance {{when compared with}} their respective tall counterparts, although the Rht genes involved in these NILs are located on several different chromosomes. Treating plants with exogenous gibberellin increased FCR severity as well as seedling lengths in all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>isolines</b> tested. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> several defense genes with known correlation with resistance to FCR pathogens between <b>the</b> Rht <b>isolines</b> following FCR inoculation indicated that <b>the</b> better resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dwarf <b>isolines</b> was not due to enhanced defense gene induction. These results suggested that the difference in FCR severity between the tall and dwarf isolines is likely due to their height difference per se or to some physiological and structural consequences of reduced height. Thus, caution should be taken when considering to exploit any FCR locus located near a height gene. © 2010 The American Phytopathological Society...|$|R

40|$|Bipolar {{junction}} transistors (BJTs) {{have been}} at <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> linear electronics from its beginnings. Although their properties can be well represented transport model equations, design and analysis approaches have, to a good extent, been limited to using current-equispaced horizontal and parallel <b>isolines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characteristic surface. Here, we resort to the geometrical structure imposed on BJTs behavior by the Early effect and voltage {{as a means to}} derive a simple, intuitive and more complete respective model that, though excluding cut-off and saturation regimes, can simplify the design and characterization of BJTs and respective circuits, including integrated devices. The approach involves using a beam <b>of</b> <b>isolines</b> converging at <b>the</b> Early voltage as <b>the</b> model <b>of</b> a BJT. <b>The</b> angles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>isolines,</b> another important aspect of BJTs, are experimentally verified often to vary almost in linear fashion with the base current, endowing the proposed Early model with an intrinsic geometric nature. An experimental-numerical methodology is suggested for the Early model estimation, and applied to 12 real-world small signal NPN BJTs. Interesting results are obtained, including <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> diverse Early voltage values for different BJT types and the observation, for <b>the</b> considered BJTs, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> almost linear variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>isoline</b> angles with <b>the</b> input current.

40|$|Figure 1 : Our method uses handle-aware isolines {{to build}} a reduced model. The three images {{visualize}} <b>the</b> <b>isolines</b> and rigidity information both associated with the handles (in crimson) at the upper jaw (left), the left fore foot (middle), and the tail (right), respectively. Note that <b>the</b> <b>isolines</b> respect <b>the</b> handles and the shape geometry. We associate a transformation to each <b>isoline</b> and identify <b>the</b> transformations <b>of</b> <b>isolines</b> associated with all the handles as the reduced domain. Handle-based mesh deformation is essentially a nonlinear problem. To allow scalability, the original deformation problem can be approximately represented by a compact set of control variables. We show the direct relation between <b>the</b> locations <b>of</b> handles on <b>the</b> mesh and the local rigidity under deformation, and introduce <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> handle-aware rigidity. Then, we present a reduced model whose control variables are intelligently distributed across the surface, respecting the rigidity information and the geometry. Specifically, for each handle, the control variables are <b>the</b> transformations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>isolines</b> <b>of</b> a harmonic scalar field representing the deformation propagation from that handle. <b>The</b> <b>isolines</b> constitute a virtual skeletal structure similar to the bones in skinning deformation, thus correctly capturing the low-frequency shape deformation. To interpolate the transformations from <b>the</b> <b>isolines</b> to <b>the</b> original mesh, we design a method which is local, linear and geometry-dependent. This novel interpolation scheme and the transformation-based reduced domain allow each iteration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonlinear solver to be fully computed over the reduced domain. This makes the per-iteration cost dependent on only <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>isolines</b> and enables compelling deformation of highly detailed shapes at interactive rates. In addition, we show how <b>the</b> handle-driven <b>isolines</b> provide an efficient means for deformation transfer without full shape correspondence...|$|R
