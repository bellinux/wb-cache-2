A sample of 127 survivors revealed that half have criminal records; 65% <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> posttraumatic stress disorder; 21% <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> major depression; 7% <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> anxiety disorder; and 7% <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> borderline personality disorder.|$|E
5|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is a {{risk factor}} for pancreatic cancer and (as noted in the Signs and symptoms section) new-onset diabetes may also be an early sign of the disease. People who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> Type2 diabetes for longer than ten years may have a 50% increased risk, as compared with non-diabetics.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sites of}} copper {{accumulation}} are {{the liver and}} the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. People with liver problems tend to come to medical attention earlier, generally as children or teenagers, than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, {{who tend to be}} in their twenties or older. Some are identified only because relatives <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{only about}} 4% of {{patients}} with photosensitive disorders are reported to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> solar urticaria. Internationally, the number is slightly larger at 5.3%. Solar urticaria may occur in all races but studies monitoring 135 African Americans and 110 Caucasians with photodermatoses found that 2.2% of the African Americans had SU and 8% of the Caucasians had the disease showing that Caucasians {{have a better chance}} of getting the disease. Globably 3.1 per 100,000 people are affected and females are more likely to be affected than males. The age ranges anywhere from 5–70 years old, but the average age is 35 and cases have been reported with children that are still in infancy. Solar urticaria accounts for less than one percent of the many documented urticaria cases. To put that into a better perspective, since its first documented case in Japan in 1916, over one hundred other instances of the disease have been reported.|$|E

25|$|Descriptive {{experience}} sampling (DES), {{developed by}} psychologist Russel Hurlburt. This is an idiographic method {{that is used}} to help examine inner experiences. This method relies on an introspective technique that allows an individual's inner experiences and characteristics to be described and measured. A beep notifies the subject to record their experience at that exact moment and 24 hours later an interview is given based on all the experiences recorded. DES has been used in subjects that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia and depression. It has also been crucial to studying the inner experiences of those who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> common psychiatric diseases.|$|E

Pink ribbons are sometimes sold as fundraisers, much like poppies on Remembrance Day.|$|E

25|$|At {{this point}} in time, ESCO2 is the only known gene to cause Roberts {{syndrome}} mutations. Also, all individuals that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> Roberts syndrome by cytogenetic techniques have also had ESCO2 mutations. Confirmation of a Roberts syndrome diagnosis requires detection of the characteristic chromosomal abnormalities (PCS and HR) or the identification of two ESCO2 mutations that {{have been linked to}} Roberts syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Small {{intestinal}} {{bacterial overgrowth}} occurs with greater frequency {{in patients who}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> IBS compared to healthy controls. SIBO is most common in diarrhea-predominate IBS but also occurs in constipation-predominant IBS more frequently than healthy controls. Symptoms of SIBO include bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation among others. IBS {{may be the result}} of the immune system interacting abnormally with gut microbiota resulting in an abnormal cytokine signalling profile.|$|E

25|$|Sclerotherapy is {{one method}} (along with surgery, {{radiofrequency}} and laser ablation) {{for the treatment}} of spider veins, occasionally varicose veins, and venous malformations. In ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy, ultrasound is used to visualize the underlying vein so the physician can deliver and monitor the injection. Sclerotherapy often takes place under ultrasound guidance after venous abnormalities <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> duplex ultrasound. Sclerotherapy under ultrasound guidance and using microfoam sclerosants {{has been shown to be}} effective in controlling reflux from the sapheno-femoral and sapheno-popliteal junctions.|$|E
25|$|All {{people with}} {{diabetes}} mellitus are at riskthose with Type I diabetes and those with Type II diabetes. The longer a person has diabetes, the higher their risk of developing some ocular problem. Between 40 and 45 percent of Americans diagnosed with diabetes have some stage of diabetic retinopathy. After 20 years of diabetes, nearly all patients with Type I diabetes and >60% of patients with Type II diabetes have some degree of retinopathy; however, these statistics were published in 2002 using data from four years earlier, limiting {{the usefulness of the}} research. The subjects would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> diabetes in the late 1970s, before modern fast acting insulin and home glucose testing.|$|E
25|$|Agreeableness is of {{fundamental}} importance to psychological well-being, predicting mental health, positive affect, and {{good relations with}} others. In both childhood and adolescence agreeableness has been tied to externalizing issues. Along with this {{it has also been}} implicated in outcomes to conflict management skills, school adjustment, peer-social status and self-esteem. Some work has been done looking into whether agreeableness levels through childhood have effects on adjustment and agreeableness into adulthood. Among young adults, individuals that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> either externalizing as well as internalizing disorders present lower levels of agreeableness and communion, and higher levels of negative emotionality, than those young adults without such disorders. Agreeableness also is reported to mediate links between anger and depression in young adults. Among college students, agreeableness is often associated with self-reports of emotional experience and control along with psycho-physiological responses to affectively charged stimuli. Across adulthood, low agreeableness {{has been found to be}} a health risk. High agreeableness, especially trust and honesty, has been linked to longevity.|$|E
