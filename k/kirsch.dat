5|$|NYU has 470,000 living alumni as of 2015. At least 37 Nobel Prize {{winners are}} {{affiliated}} with NYU. NYU {{is associated with}} a great number of important inventions and discoveries. For example, cardiac defibrillator and artificial cardiac pacemaker (Barouh Berkovits), closed-chest cardiac defibrillator (William B. Kouwenhoven), laser (Gordon Gould), atom bomb (Frederick Reines), polio vaccine (Albert Sabin), RFID (Mario Cardullo), telephone handset (Robert G. Brown), wireless microphone (Hung-Chang Lin), first digital image scanner (Russell A. <b>Kirsch),</b> television (Benjamin Adler), light beer (Joseph Owades), non-stick cookware (John Gilbert), black hole thermodynamics (Jacob Bekenstein), polymer science (Herman Francis Mark), microwave (Ernst Weber), X-ray crystallography (Paul Peter Ewald), barcode (Jerome Swartz), structure of the DNA (Francis Crick), tau lepton (Martin Lewis Perl), processes for creating food coloring, decaffeination and sugar substitute (Torunn Atteraas Garin), processes for the mass production of penicillin (Jasper H. Kane), X-ray generator and rotational radiation therapy (John G. Trump), nuclear reactor and hydrogen bomb (John Archibald Wheeler), and contact lenses (Norman Gaylord), among many others. Alumnus Fred Waller who invented Cinerama and the Waller Gunnery Trainer, also obtained the first patent for a water ski. The first patents for touch screen cash machine (Richard J. Orford), and zoom lens (Leonard Bergstein), were also obtained by NYU alumni. Some of the most prolific inventors in American history are NYU alumni, for example Jerome H. Lemelson whose 605 patents involved the cordless telephone, fax machine, videocassette recorder and camcorder, among others; Samuel Ruben whose inventions include electric battery; James Wood who invented cable-lift elevator, fabricated the steel cables for the Brooklyn Bridge and contributed to the development of lockmaking, submarine, electric generator, electric motor, transformer and the design of the refrigerator; and Albert Macovski whose innovations include the single-tube color camera and real-time phased array imaging for ultrasound. NYU is the birthplace of the tractor beam and 5G. Before and during World War II, NYU's Tandon School of Engineering worked on problems whose solution {{led to the development of}} radar, and later broke ground in electromagnetic theory, electronics in general, and solved re-entry problems of the manned space capsules, as well as helped develop and design the NASDAQ Automated Quote System and trading floors. Developer of the early telephone systems in the United States Bancroft Gherardi Jr., developer of the submarine communications facilities Jack M. Sipress, inventor of Italy's first computer Mario Tchou, designer of the Panama Canal locks Henry C. Goldmark, designer of the Pentagon Hugh John Casey, designer of the Apollo Lunar Module Thomas J. Kelly, as well as the designer of virtually every major bridge in New York City from the George Washington to the Verrazano, Leopold Just, are also NYU alumni.|$|E

25|$|Researchers Irving <b>Kirsch</b> and Thomas Moore have contested the {{pharmacological}} {{activity of}} antidepressants in {{the relief of}} depression, and state that the evidence is most consistent a role as active placebos. Their study consisted of a meta analysis incorporating data from both published studies and unpublished data obtained from the FDA via a Freedom of Information Act request. Overall, antidepressant pills worked 18% better than placebos, a statistically significant difference, but not one that is clinically significant. In a later publication, <b>Kirsch</b> concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for clinical significance.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half, the Boilermakers finally scored after <b>Kirsch</b> passed {{for a total}} of 73 yards on an 85-yard drive that ended with his {{touchdown}} 18-yard touchdown pass to Bryant. The Irish answered on Quinn's second touchdown pass to Samardzija of 55 yards, however <b>Kirsch</b> cut the Irish lead once again to 21 after a 3-yard touchdown pass to Bryant. Although Quinn and <b>Kirsch</b> threw back-to-back interceptions, neither team scored again in the third, leaving the score 35-14. The Irish started the fourth quarter scoring with a 22-yard touchdown pass from Quinn to John Carlson, for Quinn's final series in the game, he would be replaced by back-ups David Wolke and Marty Mooney for the final three drives. <b>Kirsch</b> led the Boilermakers to a 5-yard touchdown rush by Kory Sheets for his final drive of the game, he would be replaced by Curtis Painter for their final two drives. The Irish, helped by Wolke's only completion of the game for 29 yards, scored again with a 10-yard rushing touchdown by Travis Thomas, for the final Irish score of the game. After both teams had turnovers, Painter and the Boilermakers capitalized with Sheets second rushing touchdown of 8 yards, giving the final score with the Irish winning 49-28. With Quinn's touchdown passes, he tied a Notre Dame record held by John Huarte of 10 straight games with touchdown passes, and also became the only Irish quarterback to pass for 300 yards in 3 straight games. After the game, the Irish moved up to 12th in the nation and would move up again to 9th before their next game, while the Boilermakers dropped from the rankings.|$|E

5000|$|Psychiatrist Daniel Carlat {{called the}} book [...] "an {{important}} book, with the reservation that <b>Kirsch’s</b> selective use of data {{gives him the}} appearance of an anti-antidepressant partisan."

Carlat argues that if antidepressants were acting purely via a placebo effect, any benzodiazepines and other drugs would show activity as well.|$|R

40|$|Reading Olga <b>Kirsch’s</b> Afrikaans poetry, one {{is struck}} by the {{important}} role {{that the experience of}} loss occupies in her oeuvre. It is evident in the first two volumes of poetry she published while still living in South Africa, {{as well as in the}} five volumes she published after emigrating to Israel in 1948. Because her poetry, especially the volumes written in Israel, exudes an air of melancholy, this article uses Freud’s writings on loss, mourning and melancholia, as well as the historical tradition preceding his work, as a guideline in exploring the way in which the experience of loss, mourning and melancholy is portrayed in <b>Kirsch’s</b> oeuvre. The article focusses on the way in which loss is portrayed in her poetry: her sense that the Jewish experience of loss over the centuries forms part of her history and identity, the way in which she experiences the loss of South Africa and the language Afrikaans in which she is best able to express herself poetically when she emigrates to Israel, the way in which the loss of her father and mother at different times in her life affected her, her feeling that her experience of loss and the ensuing melancholy are carried over to her children...|$|R
25|$|However, {{there are}} serious doubts about the used methods and the {{interpretation}} of the results, especially the use of 0.5 as cut-off point for the effect-size. A complete reanalysis and recalculation based on the same FDA data discovered that the <b>Kirsch</b> study suffered from important flaws in the calculations. The authors concluded that although {{a large percentage of the}} placebo response was due to expectancy, this was not true for the active drug. Besides confirming drug effectiveness, they found that the drug effect was not related to depression severity.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of fluoxetine and other antidepressants {{in the treatment}} of mild-to-moderate depression is controversial. A meta-analysis published by <b>Kirsch</b> in 2008 suggests, in those with mild or moderate symptoms, the efficacy of fluoxetine and other SSRIs is clinically insignificant. A 2009 meta-analysis by Fournier which evaluated patient-level data from six trials of the SSRI paroxetine and the non-SSRI antidepressant imipramine has been further cited as evidence that antidepressants exhibit minimal efficacy in mild to moderate depression. A 2012 meta-analysis using individual patient level-data of fluoxetine for the treatment of depression concluded statistically and clinically significant benefit was seen irrespective of baseline depression severity, and no significant effect was found on baseline severity on observed efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Although neither {{team was}} able to score on their opening drives, the Irish quickly got going on their second, and were led by Brady Quinn's passing and Darius Walker's rushes on a 90-yard drive that ended with a Rashon Powers-Neal 1-yard {{touchdown}} to give the Irish the lead. The Boilermakers, led by Brandon <b>Kirsch</b> to the Irish 2-yard line, failed to answer after a goal line fumble was recovered by the Irish. Quinn then led the Irish on a 98-yard drive, that lasted into the second quarter, and ended with another 1-yard touchdown run by Powers-Neal. The ensuing kickoff was returned by Dorien Bryant 66 yards to give the Boilermakers {{the ball on the}} Notre Dame 30-yard line, however, they were unable to advance it and didn't score due to a missed 43-yard field goal. Quinn took advantage and led the Irish on a 73-yard drive ending with his touchdown pass to Jeff Samardzija. With another 10-yard touchdown run by Walker later in the quarter, the Irish took a 28-0 lead at halftime.|$|E

500|$|Tessa, and <b>Kirsch's</b> {{character}} Richie, {{were designed}} as MacLeod's mortal companions and contacts. Tessa and MacLeod are lovers and share deep feelings for each other. Adrian Paul commented that MacLeod spent twelve years with Tessa without wanting another relationship and that [...] "...she {{was a very}} important part of his life". Vandernoot thought that [...] "...the relationship between Tessa and MacLeod was very deep because very soon, he told her about himself (...) because he trusted her, and I think trust is a very good definition of their relationship.
