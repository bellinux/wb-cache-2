50|$|Cancer <b>immunosurveillance</b> is {{a theory}} {{formulated}} in 1957 by Burnet and Thomas, who proposed that lymphocytes act as sentinels in recognizing and eliminating continuously arising, nascent transformed cells. Cancer <b>immunosurveillance</b> {{appears to be an}} important host protection process that decreases cancer rates through inhibition of carcinogenesis and maintaining of regular cellular homeostasis. It has also been suggested that <b>immunosurveillance</b> primarily functions as a component of a more general process of cancer immunoediting.|$|E
50|$|This {{discovery}} furthered {{the development}} of a previously hypothesized theory, the <b>immunosurveillance</b> theory. The <b>immunosurveillance</b> theory suggests that the immune system routinely patrols the cells of the body, and, upon recognition of a cell, or group of cells, that has become cancerous, it will attempt to destroy them, thus preventing the growth of some tumors. (Burnet, 1970) More recent evidence has suggested that <b>immunosurveillance</b> is only part of a larger role the immune system plays in fighting cancer. Remodeling of this theory has led to the progression of the immunoediting theory, in which there are 3 phases, Elimination, Equilibrium and Escape.|$|E
50|$|As mentioned, the {{elimination}} phase {{is synonymous with}} the classic <b>immunosurveillance</b> theory.|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{the innate}} immune system has also been {{associated}} with <b>immunosurveillance</b> (Dunn et al., 2004).|$|E

50|$|Immunoediting is {{a dynamic}} process that {{consists}} of <b>immunosurveillance</b> and tumor progression. It {{is made up of}} three phases: elimination, equilibrium, and escape.|$|E
50|$|Cancer <b>immunosurveillance</b> and immunoediting {{is based}} on (i) {{protection}} against development of spontaneous and chemically induced tumors in animal systems and (ii) identification of targets for immune recognition of human cancer.|$|E

50|$|Cancer <b>immunosurveillance</b> is {{a process}} by which an organism's immune system recognizes {{transformed}} cells in order to inhibit the growth of neoplastic tissue. It comprises {{the first phase of}} immunoediting and is also known as the elimination phase.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Lloyd Old, the organization’s former {{director}} and scientific chairman, {{participated in the}} discovery of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and the important tumor suppressor p53.

50|$|In immunocompetent patients, Epstein-Barr virus {{can cause}} {{infectious}} mononucleosis in adolescents, which is otherwise asymptomatic in children during their childhood. However, in immunosuppressed transplant patients, {{the lack of}} T-cell <b>immunosurveillance</b> {{can lead to the}} proliferation of these EBV-infected of B-lymphocytes.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: During the {{elimination}} phase, immune effector cells such as natural killer cells, {{with the help}} of dendritic and CD4+ T-cells, are able to recognize and eliminate tumor cells (left). As a result of heterogeneity, however, tumor cells which are less immunogenic are able to escape <b>immunosurveillance</b> (right).|$|E
50|$|Robert D. Schreiber, Ph.D., {{and colleagues}} publish the first {{evidence}} that the immune system {{plays a role in}} controlling cancer, a process called <b>immunosurveillance.</b> In 2007, they find in mice that some cancers are kept in a state of “equilibrium,” which leads them to suggest that one day immunotherapy may convert cancer into a chronic but controllable disease.|$|E
50|$|Lymphocytes: These are cells {{responsible}} for immune responses that circulate in the blood. Normally, only small numbers {{are found in}} the CTs throughout the body. The number increases dramatically at certain sites of tissue inflammation. They are also very numerous in the lamina propria of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, where they are involved in <b>immunosurveillance.</b> The lamina propria is a layer of loose CT lying immediately beneath the epithelium.|$|E
50|$|The {{recognition}} of mutation-induced antigens on tumors by T cells {{is only one}} aspect of a more general phenomenon which can rightly be named: T cell <b>immunosurveillance</b> of the integrity of the genome. Any somatic mutation has a probability of producing a new antigen that can be recognized by T cells. If the mutated cell divides significantly, the resulting clonal population may be eliminated by a T lymphocyte response.|$|E
50|$|A common side-effect of many {{immunosuppressive}} {{drugs is}} immunodeficiency, {{because the majority}} of them act non-selectively, resulting in increased susceptibility to infections and decreased cancer <b>immunosurveillance.</b> There are also other side-effects, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, peptic ulcers, lipodystrophy, moon face, liver and kidney injury. The immunosuppressive drugs also interact with other medicines and affect their metabolism and action. Actual or suspected immunosuppressive agents can be evaluated in terms of their effects on lymphocyte subpopulations in tissues using immunohistochemistry.|$|E
50|$|The {{elimination}} phase, {{also known}} as <b>immunosurveillance,</b> includes innate and adaptive immune responses to tumour cells. For the innate immune response, several effector cells such as natural killer cells and T cells are activated by the inflammatory cytokines, which are released by the growing tumour cells, macrophages and stromal cells surrounding the tumour cells. The recruited tumour-infiltrating NK cells and macrophages produce interleukin 12 and interferon gamma, which kill tumour cells by cytotoxic mechanisms such as perforin, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligands (TRAILs), and reactive oxygen species.|$|E
5000|$|Natural killer cells {{often lack}} antigen-specific cell surface receptors, so {{are part of}} innate immunity, i.e. able to react {{immediately}} with no prior exposure to the pathogen. In both mice and humans, NKs {{can be seen to}} play a role in tumor <b>immunosurveillance</b> by directly inducing the death of tumor cells (NKs act as cytolytic effector lymphocytes), even in the absence of surface adhesion molecules and antigenic peptides. This role of NK cells is critical to immune success particularly because T cells are unable to recognize pathogens in the absence of surface antigens. [...] Tumor cell detection results in activation of NK cells and consequent cytokine production and release.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the major}} {{characteristics}} of vertebrate immunology is thymic involution, the shrinking of the thymus with age, resulting in changes in {{the architecture of the}} thymus and a decrease in tissue mass. This process is a conserved sequence or (orthologous sequences) in almost all vertebrates, from birds, teleosts, amphibians to reptiles, though the thymi of a few species of sharks are known not to involute. T-cells are named for the thymus where T-lymphocytes migrate from the bone marrow to mature. Its regression has been linked to the reduction in <b>immunosurveillance</b> in the elderly. Though thymic involution has been linked to senescence, it is not induced by senescence as the organ starts involuting from a young age [...] - as early as the first year of life in humans.|$|E
50|$|Already {{during his}} period at the UiT, {{the idea of}} cancer {{vaccines}} came to Gaudernack's mind. The fact that cancer cell lines injected into mice {{were killed by the}} animal’s immune system was fascinating in a time with the development of the cancer <b>immunosurveillance</b> theory and cancer immunoediting hypothesis. At the end of the 1980s the three-dimensional structure of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecule was defined in parallel to identification of tumor-specific gene aberrations. In light of these discoveries, Gaudernack positioned himself early in the development of peptide vaccines based on genetic aberrations. One such genetic aberration was mutations in the proto-oncogene Ras subfamily. Together with his team, Gustav was among the first in the world to develop peptide-based cancer vaccines derived from mutated Ras proto-oncogenes. The peptides contain the various mutations that are present in the catalytic site of the Ras protein.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability of}} the immune system to mount a strong {{protective}} response depends on the receptor diversity of naive T-cells (TCR). Thymic involution results in a decreased output of naïve T lymphocytes - mature T cells that are tolerant to self antigens, responsive to foreign antigens, but have not yet been stimulated by a foreign substance. In adults, naïve T-cells are hypothesized to be primarily maintained through homeostatic proliferation, or cell division of existing naïve T cells. Though homeostatic proliferation helps sustain TCR even with minimal to nearly absent thymic activity, it does not increase the receptor diversity. For yet unknown reasons, TCR diversity drops drastically around age 65. Loss of thymic function and TCR diversity is thought to contribute to weaker <b>immunosurveillance</b> of the elderly, including increasing instances of diseases such as cancers, autoimmunity, and opportunistic infections.|$|E
50|$|ERVs {{have been}} found to be {{associated}} to disease not only through disease-causing relations, but also through immunity. The frequency of ERVs in long terminal repeats (LTRs) likely correlates to viral adaptations to take advantage of immunity signaling pathways that promote viral transcription and replication. A study done in 2016 investigated the benefit of ancient viral DNA integrated into a host through gene regulation networks induced by interferons, a branch of innate immunity. These cytokines are first to respond to viral infection and are also important in <b>immunosurveillance</b> for malignant cells. ERVs are predicted to act as cis-regulatory elements, but much of the adaptive consequences of this for certain physiological functions is still unknown. There is data that supports the general role of ERVs in the regulation of human interferon response, specifically to interferon-gamma (IFNG). For example, interferon-stimulated genes were found to be greatly enriched with ERVs bound by signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1) and/or Interferon regulatory factor (IRF1) in CD14+ macrophages.|$|E
5000|$|Immunodeficiency (or immune deficiency) is a {{state in}} which the immune system's ability to fight {{infectious}} disease and cancer is compromised or entirely absent. Most cases of immunodeficiency are acquired ("secondary") due to extrinsic factors that affect the patient's immune system. Examples of these extrinsic factors include HIV infection, extremes of age, and environmental factors, such as nutrition. In the clinical setting, the immunosuppression by some drugs, such as steroids, can be either an adverse effect or the intended purpose of the treatment. Examples of such use is in organ transplant surgery as an anti-rejection measure and in patients suffering from an overactive immune system, as in autoimmune diseases. Some people are born with intrinsic defects in their immune system, or primary immunodeficiency. A person who has an immunodeficiency of any kind {{is said to be}} immunocompromised. An immunocompromised person may be particularly vulnerable to opportunistic infections, in addition to normal infections that could affect everyone. Immunodeficiency also decreases cancer <b>immunosurveillance,</b> in which the immune system scans the body's cells and kills neoplastic ones.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{last fifteen}} years have seen a reemergence of {{interest}} in cancer <b>immunosurveillance</b> and a broadening of this concept into one termed cancer immunoediting. The latter, supported by strong experimental data derived from murine tumor models and provocative correlative data obtained by studying human cancer, holds that the immune system not only protects the host against development of primary nonviral cancers but also sculpts tumor immunogenicity. Cancer immunoediting is a process consisting of three phases: elimination (i. e., cancer <b>immunosurveillance),</b> equilibrium, and escape. Herein, we summarize the data supporting the existence {{of each of the}} three cancer immunoediting phases. The full understanding of the immunobiology of cancer <b>immunosurveillance</b> and immunoediting will hopefully stimulate development of more effective immunotherapeutic approaches to control and/or eliminate human cancers...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT T CELL <b>IMMUNOSURVEILLANCE</b> IN PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA Rebecca A. Evans Robert H. Vonderheide The {{prevailing}} {{theory of}} cancer immune surveillance, as understood from carcinogen-driven mouse models of highly mutated tumors, states that T cell-mediated immune pressure drives {{a continuum of}} tumor elimination, equilibrium, and escape. This “Triple E Hypothesis” reflects host-tumor interactions in a subset of human cancers that have responded well to cancer immunotherapy, including melanoma, small cell lung carcinoma, and bladder carcinoma; yet, many tumors remain refractory to such interventions. These clinical failures suggest that <b>immunosurveillance</b> in other cancers manifests with a fundamentally different biology than previously described. Here, using a genetic mouse model of spontaneous pancreatic carcinoma that features an immunosuppressive microenvironment and few non-synonymous mutations, we report that {{the natural history of}} such cancers is T cell-independent. Furthermore, tumor escape from T cell surveillance is not required for cancer progression, as tumor cells arising in T cell-depleted genetic mice grow unchecked in immune-competent hosts upon implantation. Checkpoint blockade with CTLA- 4 and PD- 1 antibodies does not expose mutant epitopes strong enough to elicit therapeutic responses; combined with whole exome sequencing of PDA-derived murine cell lines, these findings confirm that that PDA does not harbor a mutational burden commensurate with the current hypothesis of <b>immunosurveillance.</b> However, ectopic expression of a neo-antigen in PDA tumor cells is sufficient to restore <b>immunosurveillance,</b> override its immunosuppressive microenvironment, and establish T cell memory against “quiescent” endogenous antigens. Thus, cardinal features of tumor <b>immunosurveillance</b> are elicited by an antigen of sufficient strength irrespective of microenvironmental immunosuppression.

40|$|<b>Immunosurveillance</b> is an {{extrinsic}} {{mechanism of}} cancer suppression that eliminates nascent tumors.

40|$|The self-encoded ligands MICA (human) and Rae- 1 (mouse) for the {{cytotoxic}} lymphocyte activating receptor NKG 2 D {{are highly}} expressed in carcinomas and inflammatory lesions {{and have been}} linked to <b>immunosurveillance</b> and graft rejection.

Here we show that epidermis-specific upregulation of Rae- 1 induced rapid, coincident and reversible changes in the organization of tissue-resident V(gamma) 5 V(delta) 1 TCRgammadelta+ intraepithelial T cells and Langerhans cells, swiftly followed by epithelial infiltration by unconventional alphabeta T cells. Whereas local V(gamma) 5 V(delta) 1 + T cells limited carcinogenesis, Langerhans cells unexpectedly promoted it. These results provide unique insight into the early phases of tissue <b>immunosurveillance</b> and indicate that acute changes in NKG 2 D ligands may alone initiate a rapid, multifaceted <b>immunosurveillance</b> response in vivo...|$|E

40|$|The <b>immunosurveillance</b> of {{transformed}} cells by {{the immune}} system {{remains one of the}} most controversial and poorly understood areas of immunity. Gene-targeted mice have greatly aided our understanding of the key effector molecules in tumor immunity. Herein, we describe spontaneous tumor development in gene-targeted mice lacking interferon (IFN) - � and/or perforin (pfp), or the immunoregulatory cytokines, interleukin (IL) - 12, IL- 18, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Both IFN- � and pfp were critical for suppression of lymphomagenesis, however the level of protection afforded by IFN- � was strain specific. Lymphomas arising in IFN-�deficient mice were very nonimmunogenic compared with those derived from pfp-deficient mice, suggesting a comparatively weaker immunoselection pressure by IFN-�. Single loss of IL- 12, IL- 18, or TNF was not sufficient for spontaneous tumor development. A significant incidence of late onset adenocarcinoma observed in both IFN-� – and pfp-deficient mice indicated that some epithelial tissues were also subject to <b>immunosurveillance.</b> Key words: <b>immunosurveillance</b> • effector • interferon • lymphoma • adenocarcinoma The online version of this article contains supplemental material...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe role {{of natural}} killer group 2, member D {{receptor}} (NKG 2 D) -expressing natural killer (NK) cells in tumor <b>immunosurveillance</b> is now well established. Nevertheless, tumor progression occurs despite tumor <b>immunosurveillance,</b> leading to cancer persistence in immunocompetent hosts. STAT 3 plays {{a pivotal role}} both in oncogenic functions and in immunosuppression. In this study, we investigated the role of STAT 3 in suppressing NK cell-mediated <b>immunosurveillance.</b> Using a colorectal cancer cell line (HT 29) that can poorly activate NK, we neutralized STAT 3 with pharmacologic inhibitors or siRNA and found that this led {{to an increase in}} NK degranulation and IFN-γ production in a TGF-β 1 -independent manner. Exposure to NKG 2 D-neutralizing antibodies partially restored STAT 3 activity, suggesting that it prevented NKG 2 D-mediated NK cell activation. On this basis, we investigated the expression of NKG 2 D ligands after STAT 3 activation in HT 29, mesenchymal stem cells, and activated lymphocytes. The NK cell recognition receptor MHC class I chain-related protein A (MICA) was upregulated following STAT 3 neutralization, and a direct interaction between STAT 3 and the MICA promoter was identified. Because cross-talk between DNA damage repair and NKG 2 D ligand expression has been shown, we assessed the influence of STAT 3 on MICA expression under conditions of genotoxic stress. We found that STAT 3 negatively regulated MICA expression after irradiation or heat shock, including in lymphocytes activated by CD 3 /CD 28 ligation. Together, our findings reveal a novel role for STAT 3 in NK cell <b>immunosurveillance</b> by modulating the MICA expression in cancer cells...|$|E
40|$|Tumor <b>immunosurveillance</b> {{influences}} oncogenesis and tumor growth, but {{it remains}} controversial whether clinical failure of <b>immunosurveillance</b> {{is a result of}} lymphocyte dysfunction or tumor escape. In this study, our goal was to characterize the physiology of tumor <b>immunosurveillance</b> in children with high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NBL). Patients and Methods Immunohistopathologic studies were carried out on 26 tumor samples from a cohort of HR-NBL patients diagnosed at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia for the 2 -year period from May 2003 to May 2005. Blood from nine HLA-A 2 patients in this cohort was analyzed for T cells specific for the antiapoptotic protein survivin. Results Survivin protein was expressed by 26 of 26 tumors. In HLA-A 2 patients, circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for survivin were detected by peptide/major histocompatibility complex tetramer analysis in the blood of eight of nine children with HR-NBL at the time of diagnosis. Rather than being selectively rendered anergic in vivo, circulating survivin-specific CTLs were highly functional as shown by cytotoxicity and interferon gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assays in six of nine patients. Survivin-specific CD 107 a mobilization by T cells was found in five of five patients. By immunohistochemistry, tumor-infiltrating T cells were few or absent in 26 of 26 tumors. Conclusion Children with HR-NBL harbor robust cellular immune responses to the universal tumor antigen survivin at the time of diagnosis, but intratumoral T cells are strikingly rare, suggesting a failure of cellular <b>immunosurveillance.</b> Efforts to develop novel therapies that increase T-cell trafficking into tumor nests are warranted.

An increasing number of studies suggest an important role of host immunity {{as a barrier to}} tumor formation and progression. Complex mechanisms and multiple pathways are involved in evading innate and adaptive immune responses, with a broad spectrum of chemicals displaying the potential to adversely influence <b>immunosurveillance.</b> The evaluation of the cumulative effects of low-dose exposures from the occupational and natural environment, especially if multiple chemicals target the same gene(s) or pathway(s), is a challenge. We reviewed common environmental chemicals and discussed their potential effects on <b>immunosurveillance.</b> Our overarching objective was to review related signaling pathways influencing immune surveillance such as the pathways involving PI 3 K/Akt, chemokines, TGF-β, FAK, IGF- 1, HIF- 1 α, IL- 6, IL- 1 α, CTLA- 4 and PD- 1 /PDL- 1 could individually or collectively impact <b>immunosurveillance.</b> A number of chemicals that are common in the anthropogenic environment such as fungicides (maneb, fluoxastrobin and pyroclostrobin), herbicides (atrazine), insecticides (pyridaben and azamethiphos), the components of personal care products (triclosan and bisphenol A) and diethylhexylphthalate with pathways critical to tumor <b>immunosurveillance.</b> At this time, these chemicals are not recognized as human carcinogens; however, it is known that they these chemicals can simultaneously persist in the environment and appear to have some potential interfere with the host immune response, therefore potentially contributing to promotion interacting with of immune evasion mechanisms, and promoting subsequent tumor growth and progression...|$|E
40|$|Our {{previous}} work demonstrated that cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) -mediated tumor <b>immunosurveillance</b> of the 15 - 12 RM tumor could be suppressed by a CD 1 d-restricted lymphocyte, {{most likely a}} natural killer (NK) T cell, which produces interleukin (IL) - 13. Here we present evidence for the effector elements in this suppressive pathway. T cell–reconstituted recombination activating gene (RAG) 2 knockout (KO) and RAG 2 /IL- 4 receptor � double KO mice showed that inhibition of <b>immunosurveillance</b> requires IL- 13 responsiveness by a non–T non–B cell. Such nonlymphoid splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice produced more transforming growth factor (TGF) -�, a potent inhibitor of CTL, ex vivo than such cells from naive mice, and this TGF- � production was dependent on the presence in vivo of both IL- 13 and CD 1 d-restricted T cells. Ex vivo TGF- � production was also abrogated by depleting either CD 11 b � or Gr- 1 � cells from the nonlymphoid cells of tumor-bearing mice. Further, blocking TGF- � or depleting Gr- 1 � cells in vivo prevented the tumor recurrence, implying that TGF-� made by a CD 11 b � Gr- 1 � myeloid cell, in an IL- 13 and CD 1 d-restricted T cell–dependent mechanism, is necessary for down-regulation of tumor <b>immunosurveillance.</b> Identification o...|$|E
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) {{represents the}} autoimmune disease {{that has been}} most studied in relation to malignancy. An examination of all published cohort studies has indicated a 9. 7 -fold increase of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among RA patients after immunosuppressive therapy, and a 2. 5 -fold increase {{in the absence of}} such treatment. Corresponding data for Sjögren's syndrome point to a similar contrast. These findings are inseparable from the hypothesis of impaired <b>immunosurveillance</b> which implies that malignancy is promoted by defects in the immune system. Studies of individuals treated with immunosuppressive drugs, particularly to prevent graft rejection, have indicated that <b>immunosurveillance</b> operates only against a restricted range of neoplasms. These include non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), squamous cell skin cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma and cervical carcinoma. Other states of immune impairment including AIDS are also associated with marked increases of NHL. There is a striking correspondence between malignancies for which there is epidemiological or laboratory evidence for a virus aetiology and those that are increased by immune impairment. In this respect the epidemiological evidence accords with experimental work that <b>immunosurveillance</b> primarily operates against neoplasms of viral origin.
