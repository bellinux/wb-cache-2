In November 1938, the Association of American Universities sent evaluators to the college and later prepared a report {{as part of the}} accreditation process. While accreditation was unhesitatingly granted, Maxwell described the report as [...] "far from flattering." [...] Not a single Jesuit faculty member held a PhD, and the report described the <b>general</b> <b>credentials</b> of the faculty as subpar for [...] "an institution of the standing of Holy Cross." [...] The accreditors recommended that faculty members pursue further studies [...] "in leading graduate and professional institutions, including at least some not connected with the Catholic Church." [...] Maxwell was proactive upon hearing this, and {{less than a month after}} taking office, he was preparing for the implementation of the recommendations. He also took a more active role than his predecessors in managing the Holy Cross athletic program, despite an apparent lack of interest in athletics. He made clear his athletic policies in the fall of 1941, when he limited the number and size of athletic scholarships, and asserted that the college needed [...] "to keep our standards where they belong," [...] even at the risk of less successful sports teams.|$|E

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Participants reviewed the current processes of clinical trial QA and noted the QA challenges presented by advanced technologies. The {{lessons learned from the}} radiotherapy QA programs of recent trials were discussed in detail. Four potential opportunities for optimizing radiotherapy QA were explored, including the use of normal tissue toxicity and tumor control metrics, biomarkers of radiation toxicity, new radiotherapy modalities such as proton beam therapy, and the international harmonization of clinical trial QA. RESULTS: Four recommendations were made: (1) to develop a tiered (and more efficient) system for radiotherapy QA and tailor the intensity of QA to the clinical trial objectives (tiers include <b>general</b> <b>credentialing,</b> trial-specific credentialing, and individual case review); (2) to establish a case QA repository; (3) to develop an evidence base for clinical trial QA and introduce innovative prospective trial designs to evaluate radiotherapy QA in clinical trials; and (4) to explore the feasibility of consolidating clinical trial QA in the United States. CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy QA can affect clinical trial accrual, cost, outcomes, and generalizability. To achieve maximum benefit, QA programs must become more efficient and evidence-based...|$|R

In order to ensure specialist registration compliance, the Academy also provides and accredits continuing medical education and continuous professional development. With recent rapid expansion of our knowledge in medicine, technological advances and scope of service, {{there is also a}} need to set up further policies to uphold clinical governance and accountability. Medical credentialing is the process of establishing qualifications of the medical professionals, organisational members or organisations, and assessing their background and competency. This has been introduced in many western countries for a number of years. In some countries, it is also a practice to allow medical service providers to network with insurance companies. However, the ultimate purpose must be to safeguard the health of patients, in addition to enhancing the credibility and quality of healthcare professionals and service providers. Medical credentialing has recently been introduced by the Hospital Authority to define the scope of practice of its staff and to maintain its quality of service. Within the Academy, a Working Group has also been set up to identify the areas for credentialing and its process. One of the first tasks is to formulate a <b>general</b> <b>credentialing</b> protocol which includes an initial accreditation process, regular reviews, and remedial and appeal procedures. Concurrently, colleges are invited to identify medical procedures and treatment which require early considerations for credentialing, and to define specific assessment and review processes. With over 6, 000 fellows working in various disciplines under 15 Academy Colleges, this endeavour will be an arduous and slowly evolving one. This may also be compounded by the blurring of conventional boundaries between disciplines with some medical management protocols and procedures being practised by fellows across colleges. Nevertheless, medical credentialing is the right direction for the development of specialty and subspecialty medicine in Hong Kong, and the Academy is grateful for the support of our colleges in this effort...|$|R

Recent research observes that in some states, technical colleges have substantially higher completion rates than do comprehensive {{community colleges}}. Yet there is scant research available that systematically compares similar students in similar programs at technical and comprehensive colleges. This study uses administrative data from Washington State to compare the outcomes of young, career-technical students across institutions, with and without extensive controls for student characteristics, educational intent, and area of study. This generates three key findings: first, technical and comprehensive colleges tend to serve quite different populations, so a true apples-to-apples comparison requires limiting the analysis to a relatively small fraction (less than 10 %) of students enrolled at either institution. Second, at least for this limited subset of career-technical students, technical schools have significantly higher certificate completion rates after three years, with no apparent deficit in associate degree completion. Our third main finding is that the differences in student outcomes within the two types of schools are much larger than differences between them. Even within this limited group, institution type alone explains a relatively small fraction of the overall variation in student outcomes across institutions. It would thus be unwise for research and policymakers to fixate on this one dimension of difference...|$|R

Although {{there is a small}} literature focusing on student outcome measurement problems, suggesting the use of cognitive achievements rather than test scores, in most cases those cognitive measures are nothing but math and science scores. This study contributes to the literature by borrowing from the measurement and psychometrics theories to decompose single scores into three categories of cognitive abilities. The hypothesis i that teachers may {{play a crucial role in}} the development of some student cognitive skills while not in the others.

40|$|Abstract: User {{authentication}} is {{a crucial}} security component for most computing systems. Yet different systems rely on different authentication mechanisms based on their particular security needs. Specifically, systems such as independently-managed Grids vary {{with regard to the}} type of credential or security token used to prove the user's identity (username/password, X. 509 certificates and Kerberos tickets are a few examples). Requiring a user to acquire credentials for all systems upfront and then handmanage and choose which of these credentials to present on a per-service basis is tedious, unreliable and potentially insecure. As an alternative, we present CredEx, an open-source, standards-based Web Service that facilitates the secure storage of credentials (a la MyProxy) and allows a user to dynamically exchange one type of credential for another using the WS-Trust token exchange protocol specification. CredEx makes use of an open-source, Java-based WS-Trust implementation developed for this effort, in addition to Java and. NET clients. With CredEx, a user can achieve single-signon by acquiring a single, default credential and then exchange that credential as needed for services requiring a different form of authentication. Although other credential exchangers exist, to our knowledge, this is the first credential manager that supports the <b>general</b> many-to-many <b>credential</b> exchange pattern, thus creating new flexibility for users as required by the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) Security Roadmap. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of CredEx by focusing on its use in bridging password-based Web Services and PKI-based grid services. As an important consequence, we illustrate how interoperability between Web and Grid Services can be based upon the WS-Security and WS-Trust specifications. 1...|$|R

30|$|The {{amount of}} effort put into searching for more closely matched {{positions}} may differ systematically between graduates with <b>general</b> and specialized <b>credentials.</b> It is not clear which graduates would put more or less effort into the search process. If general-education graduates dedicate less effort relative to graduates with specialized credentials, then the matching estimates above may simply reflect employers’ willingness to offer a premium for specialized skills. However, general-education graduates possess many important labor market skills such as problem-solving, communication, and on-the-job learning abilities which can provide them greater flexibility to move across industries and occupations (Giles and Drewes 2001; Heijke et al. 2003). Given the productive potential of their dynamic skill sets, those with general fields may put more effort into securing a match. Lin et al.

Thus, the search effort among graduates with general skills may in fact not {{be very different from}} those with specialized skills.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{original}} aim of {{the study}} was to report on the methods used to develop a new model of service delivery, namely nurse led well women's clinics. However participants identified several key barriers to an expansion of their role that had not been accounted for in either the original policy directive or in the continuing professional development delivered as preparation for their accreditation to deliver cervical screening services from a general medical practice. How the group addressed these barriers became the objective of this action research study. Design: This paper reports the findings from an action research study with three registered nurses working in <b>general</b> practice <b>credentialed</b> to provide cervical screening services. Six reflective group meetings were held over a six‑month time frame facilitated by the lead researcher. During the meetings a variety of creative techniques were used to stimulate discussion, The meetings were audio recorded and partially transcribed. Feedback from the concurrent data generation and analysis was provided to participants the following week. Setting: A regional division of general practice. Subjects: Three registered nurses employed by the general medical practice. Main outcomes measures: The barriers identified by participants in the process of implementing change in their clinical practice to incorporate the provision of cervical screening services. Results: There were three themes identified in the findings from this study that related to the myth of interdisciplinary collaboration in general practice. These were: nurses in general practice renegotiating their roles; identifying and negotiating gendered patterns of cervical screening; and multidisciplinary collaboration and retention of practice nurses. Another important outcome of this study that relates to change management is the role of practice champions in implementing new models of primary care. Conclusion: The potential role of nurses in general medical practice in Australia has broadened considerably in recent years, mainly due to Australian Government driven initiatives which reward general practitioners for employing nurses; a recognition by the nursing profession that general practice nursing is a specialist area of nursing practice; the establishment of a national professional association for nurses working in general practice; an increase in the availability of continuing professional development for nurses working in general practice; and additional Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) item numbers relating to general practice nursing, which gives the general practice a rebate for the services the nurse provides independently of the general practitioner. Suggestions are made that address the barriers identified by participants in the process of implementing change in their clinical practice to incorporate the provision of cervical screening services...|$|R

The sentiment has been stated in its most elemental form: 2 ̆ 2 Say you 2 ̆ 7 re sorry when you hurt somebody. 2 ̆ 2 However, an apology has special linguistic weight: it is an admission of regret, remorse and responsibility. As such, apologies may prove a case of medical negligence. In an attempt to decrease the potential harms of saying 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 7 m sorry 2 ̆ 2 in the healthcare setting, some state legislatures have enacted statutes intended to protect physicians. The thesis of this Article is that apologies should not be issued in the medical setting, and that apology laws are misguided. These laws work against the important social policy goal of improving patient safety by discouraging healthcare workers from openly acknowledging and correcting systematic errors and deficiencies in human performance. Apology laws are also misguided because they bolster the failed litigation regime of deterrence and corrective justice of medical injuries. Lastly, these laws may require individual physicians to apologize for the actions (or inactions) of a complex healthcare delivery system over which physicians have little authority or control, rendering the apologies contrived and insincere.

Specifically, the study examines a) differences in background information between students possessing GED credentials vs. traditional high school diploma regarding intent to persist at community college, b) factors influencing persistence, and c) possession of a GED credential’s impact upon intention to persist. Three theories were foundation of this study’s conceptual framework including 1) Knowles’ (1984) andragogy, Ryan 2 ̆ 6 Deci’s (2000) self-determination, and Ajzen’s (1991) planned behavior. The theory of andragogy informs institutional representatives regarding adult learner need. Self-determination theory reveals GED credential students’ life situations and their need for autonomy resulting in academic persistence. Theory of planned behavior reminds administrators that control and volition must include learning environments conducive to task accomplishment. This study employed a quantitative method using the 2014 SENSE survey. Student demographics including background, socioeconomic, and enrollment patterns were analyzed through descriptive statistics. Comparison between students possessing GED credentials and traditional high diplomas was accomplished using t-test and crosstabulation methods. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the probability to which college readiness and institutional intervention predicts students’ intent to persist in community college. The results indicate {{a greater percentage of}} GED credentialed students were non-traditional aged, married, had children living in the home, had a greater instance of self-reported lower grades, and were first generation students. Results of independent samples t-tests and cross-tabulation tests indicated statistically significant difference in age, self-reported high school GPA, college readiness, and institutional intervention, between students who possessed GED credentials vs. those who earned a traditional high school diploma. The logistic regression analysis revealed that gender, race/ethnicity, 1 st generation enrollment status, student enrolled in at least one developmental class, advising, and faculty support were statistically significant factors on GED credentialed students’ intent to persist. Community college faculty intervention has great impact upon intention to persist for GED credentialed students. This study demonstrated the importance of syllabi containing clear student expectations, student-centered pedagogical method, and direction to obtain instructor assistance.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of Latino students presents unique challenges to and infinite possibilities for the educational system. Significant numbers of second-generation Latino students are considered at risk for completing a high school credentialing program. Latino students {{in public and private}} high schools were more likely to drop out than their White counterparts, and this has curtailed the advancement of Latinos into post-secondary settings. Ultimately, this impacts economic upward mobility. Furthermore, males are more likely than females to drop out of high school, are more frequently disciplined, suspended, and/or expelled from school than their gender counterparts (Perkins-Gough, 2006; Sacks, 2005; Solórzano,Villalpando, 2 ̆ 6 Oseguera, 2005; Yosso 2 ̆ 6 Solórzano, 2006). This phenomenologically informed multi-case study was conducted to report the recollections of second-generation Latino high school students involved in one high school credentialing option, the Adult Basic Education (ABE) /Under-aged General Education Development (GED) Program. The study relied primarily on gathering data via semi-structured interviews yielding audiotaped transcripts, engaging in recording personal notes in a journal, and amassing pertinent documents for analysis. The results of the study revealed that alternative programs such as the ABE/Under-aged GED program serve an important purpose. Students, who require a more structured environment with a lower student to teacher ratio and greater academic focus than the traditional high school context, can earn a high school credential despite obstacles which have cast them in the category referred to as at risk. Such {{was the case with the}} five Latinos who were the subjects of the study. They all successfully navigated the program, mastered the curriculum and earned a <b>General</b> Education Development <b>credential.</b> In order to accomplish this feat, these Latinos demonstrated resilience, persistence, and tenacity in the face of peer-pressure, poverty, illness, single-parent family dynamics, and self-doubt. Moreover, the development of positive relationships with and among all stakeholders must be a priority for everyone in the school building. Schools which create a culture that is caring, consistent, and comprehensible have positive influences on all school stakeholders. A school culture and climate that fosters positive student-teacher, student-administrator, and teacher-administrator relationships provides an environmental protective factor that increases the likelihood of academic and personal resilience for students. The conclusions which were constructed utilized an inquiry framework based upon a critical perspective, primarily in the Latinoa/Latino Critical Race Theory tradition. The interwoven concepts of Leadership for Social Justice and the Ethics of Accountability Practice were paramount in searching for the real-life possibilities of how educational leadership is capable of enhancing and/or hindering the educational experiences of these Latino students.
