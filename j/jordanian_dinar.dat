25|$|Jordan’s Water Strategy 2009–2022 {{includes}} investments of <b>Jordanian</b> <b>Dinar</b> 5.86 billion (US$8.24 billion) over {{a period}} of 15 years, corresponding to more than 160% of Jordan's GDP. According to an earlier water sector investment plan for the time from 1998 to 2010 (published in 1997), the estimated costs for water projects were US$1,916 million, while sanitation projects were estimated at US$926 million, corresponding to about US$240 million per year. Actual investments towards the end of that period were only slightly below these expected figures: They stood at 900m JD in the six years from 2005 to 2010, averaging 150m JD (US$215) or 28 JD (US$40) per capita.|$|E
25|$|Jordan's {{disengagement}} {{from the}} West Bank {{led to a}} slowing of the Jordanian economy. The <b>Jordanian</b> <b>dinar</b> lost {{a third of its}} value in 1988, and Jordan's foreign debt reached a figure double that of its gross national product (GNP). Jordan introduced austere measures to combat the economic crisis. On 16April 1989 the government increased prices of gasoline, licensing fees, alcoholic beverages, and cigarettes, between 15% to 50%, in a bid to increase revenues in accordance with an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF agreement was to enable Jordan to reschedule its $6billion debt, and obtain loans totaling $275million over 18months. On 18April riots in Ma'an spread to other southern towns such as Al-Karak and Tafila, where the New York Times reported that around 4,000 people gathered in the streets and clashed with the police, resulting in six protesters killed and 42 injured, and two policemen killed and 47 injured.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, King Abdullah {{gave the}} go-ahead {{for a new}} National Water Strategy until 2022, {{replacing}} an earlier Water Strategy from 1998. The strategy included investments of <b>Jordanian</b> <b>Dinar</b> 5.86 billion (US$8.24 billion) {{over a period of}} 15 years, corresponding to more than 160% of Jordan's GDP. It also foresaw a decreasing reliance on groundwater from 32% in 2007 to 17%, increased use of treated wastewater in agriculture from 10% to 13% and increased use of desalination from 1% to 31%. According to then-Minister of Water, Raed Abu Soud, even after the completion of the Disi Water Conveyance Project, the water deficit in 2022 would be about 500 million cubic metres, highlighting the need to include desalination under the Red Sea-Dead Sea canal in the strategy. The strategy also envisaged institutional reforms such as enacting a new water law, separating operational from administrative functions, as well as production from distribution operations, creating a Water Council with advisory functions and establishing a Water Regulatory Commission. While the legal and institutional reforms were not implemented, the Disi Water Conveyance Project was completed in 2013 by the Turkish firm Gama. The influx of about one million refugees from Syria since 2012 increased the population of Jordan to more than nine million. It also increased water demand substantially. For lack of finaning, the Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal is not being pursued any more in its original form for the time being. Instead, a scaled-down, more realistic version is being pursued. This project involves a water swap between Jordan and Israel, with Jordan supplying desalinated water from Aqaba to Southern Israel, while Israel provides additional water from the Sea of Galilee to Northern Jordan. Brine water from the desalination plant is to be supplied to the Dead Sea. As of 2015, the bidding for the desalination plant at Aqaba was under preparation.|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{examine the}} {{expenditure}} on cigarette smoking in Jordan {{and compare the}} costs with potential investments in food and other essential items. Methods Review of available statistics and calculations were performed to estimate the economic cost of cigarette smoking in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Data on tobacco use and on household expenditures were collected from the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan official databases. Information on the percentage of adult male smokers in each income group was based on cross-sectional data from 804 adult smokers. The average daily expenditure on cigarettes by cigarette smokers {{was based on a}} sample selected using a multistage, geographically clustered design. An example of a balanced diet was constructed {{on the basis of the}} recommendations of the jointly published dietary guidelines of the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture. Results Cigarette smoking prevalence is the highest among the poorest, with the highest rate (57 %) being among adult males with an income of 100 to 250 <b>Jordanian</b> <b>dinars</b> per month as compared with the prevalence rate of 14 % among adult males with an income of 500 <b>Jordanian</b> <b>dinars</b> or more per month. Our calculations show that the poorest 40 % of adult males are 1. 7 times more likely to smoke cigarettes than the richest 17 % of adult males. The average poorest adult male cigarette smoker with an income of 100 to 250 <b>Jordanian</b> <b>dinars</b> per month spends approximately 25 times more on cigarettes than on health, approximately 10 times more on cigarettes than on education, approximately 2. 5 times more on cigarettes than on housing, and approximately 1. 5 times more on cigarettes than on food. The amount spent on cigarettes could potentially add up to 115 calories of a balanced diet per capita daily or 850 calories of a balanced diet per average cigarette smoker daily. Smoking cost the country 1 billion <b>Jordanian</b> <b>dinars</b> in 2012, including money spent on tobacco and smoking-related diseases, which amounted to approximately 5 % of the gross domestic product. These calculations underestimate the real cost of smoking because these do not include the loss in work productivity due to smoking, which can be substantial. Conclusions Our positive analysis shows that by adopting policies that reduce cigarette use, Jordan would be able to achieve both short- and long-run economic gains that will disproportionally benefit the poorest. Normative analysis suggests that an increase in tobacco taxes is likely to be the most efficient policy tool to reduce cigarette smoking in Jordan. PublishedN/...|$|R
