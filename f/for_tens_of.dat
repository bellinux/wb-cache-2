Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was deeply {{suspicious of the}} UN, and was loath {{to do anything that}} would benefit the country's Shia Muslims.

5|$|In Kyushu, {{officials}} evacuated over {{a quarter}} of a million people in fear of Typhoon Nabi affecting Japan. These continued after the storm made landfall to protect residents from flood waters and landslides. The first order during the storm took place in the Arita district. In Miyazaki City, 21,483households were evacuated following reports of significant overflow on the nearby river. Another 10,000residences were vacated in Nobeoka following similar reports. The entirety of the West Japan Railway Company was shut down. Canceled train services affected 77,800people on Shikoku. Ferry service was also shut down, cutting off transportation <b>for</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> thousands of people. In addition, at least 723flights were cancelled because of the storm. Japan's second-largest refinery, Idemitsu Kosan, stopped shipments to other refineries across the area, and Japan's largest refinery, Nippon Oil, stopped all sea shipments. The Cosmo Oil Company, Japan's fourth largest refinery, stopped all shipments to Yokkaichi and Sakaide refineries. About 700schools in the country were closed. Approximately 1,500soldiers were dispatched to Tokyo to help coastal areas prepare for Typhoon Nabi's arrival, and to clean up after the storm. Officials in the Miyazaki Prefecture issued a flood warning for expected heavy rains in the area.|$|E

25|$|It {{appears that}} some {{deposits}} formed during the snowball period {{could only have}} formed {{in the presence of}} an active hydrological cycle. Bands of glacial deposits up to 5,500 meters thick, separated by small (meters) bands of non-glacial sediments, demonstrate that glaciers melted and re-formed repeatedly <b>for</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> millions of years; solid oceans would not permit this scale of deposition. It is considered possible that ice streams such as seen in Antarctica today could have caused these sequences.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} skulls discovered in the Americas by archaeologists is an Upper Paleolithic specimen named the Luzia Woman. According to archaeologist Walter Neves of the University of São Paulo, Luzia's Paleo-Indian predecessors lived in South East Asia <b>for</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> thousands of years, after migrating from Africa, and began arriving in the New World, as early as 15,000 years ago.

25|$|As for the {{prospects}} {{of the end of}} the current interglacial, while the four most recent interglacials lasted about 10,000 years, the interglacial before that lasted around 28,000 years. Milankovitch-type calculations indicate that the present interglacial would probably continue <b>for</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> thousands of years naturally in the absence of human perturbations. Other estimates (Loutre and Berger, based on orbital calculations) put the unperturbed length of the present interglacial at 50,000 years. Berger (EGU 2005 presentation) believes that the present CO2 perturbation will last long enough to suppress the next glacial cycle entirely.|$|E

25|$|The {{climate of}} the United Kingdom {{has not always been}} the way it is today. During some periods it was much warmer and in others it was much colder. The last glacial period was a period of extreme cold weather that lasted <b>for</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> {{thousands}} of years and ended about 10,000 years ago. During this period the temperature was so low that much of the surrounding ocean froze and a great ice sheet extended over all of the United Kingdom except the south of England (connected to mainland Europe via the dry English Channel) and southern coastal areas of Wales.|$|E
25|$|Stars {{greater than}} 8solar masses (M⊙) will likely end {{their lives in}} {{dramatic}} supernovae explosions, while planetary nebulae seemingly only occur {{at the end of}} the lives of intermediate and low mass stars between 0.8M⊙ to 8.0M⊙. Progenitor stars that form planetary nebulae will spend most of their lifetimes converting their hydrogen into helium in the star's core by nuclear fusion at about 15million K. This generated energy creates outward pressure from fusion reactions in the core, equally balancing the crushing inward pressures of the star's gravity. Hence, all single intermediate to low-mass stars on the main sequence can last <b>for</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> millions to billions of years.|$|E
25|$|The Dolmens {{widespread}} in Europe {{and much of}} Asia are interpreted as Neolithic burial chambers. Large boulders make excellent long term markers for important and sacred places, just as burial plots are marked by large stones today. Some petroforms could be close to ancient burial areas, or near sacred areas associated with the dead. Large rocks are a universal marker that can last for generations. Boulders will last <b>for</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> thousands of years. In memory of a person or the history about a place, these markers help future generations {{to learn about the}} past. These markers help to provide long term memories and reminders of a time long ago.|$|E
