40|$|The {{importance}} of technology platforms in <b>diversified</b> <b>companies</b> as networks of unique technologies in diverse applications is increasing. The {{reason is that}} technology platforms support <b>diversified</b> <b>companies</b> to handle the conflicting priorities of fulfilling the customer demand for individualized innovations, while generating company-wide technological synergies. Thus, the success of <b>diversified</b> <b>companies</b> can be decisively determined by the implementation of technology platforms. A significant prerequisite for this matter, among others, is a coherent concept for the systematization of the requirements of technology platforms.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the value effect corporate diversification on firms {{listed on the}} JSE Exchange. The value gain or loss for the diversified firms is measured using Berger and Ofek's (1995) model that estimates the value of diversified companies' segments {{as though they were}} independent companies. The result indicates corporate diversification in South Africa is value enhancing. Evidence shows that sample of <b>diversified</b> <b>companies</b> are traded, on average, 39 - 57 (Excess Value 0. 33 to 0. 45) percent above the industry averages. The value gain is higher in related-diversification than unrelated ones. A similar assessment of a sample of 57 focused companies showed a much lower Excess Value (EV). The EV for <b>diversified</b> <b>companies</b> (0. 33 - 0. 45) is higher than the EV for focused companies (0. 00 - 0. 19) suggesting that <b>diversified</b> <b>companies</b> are traded at premium as compared to focused companies. Further analysis of the result shows that the value gain is higher in the medium sized sample companies as compared to the bigger companies. Regression of the EV in relation to firms' characteristics (number of segments per company, capital expenditure, and profitability) showed no significant relationship. To explain the possible sources for higher premium shown in <b>diversified</b> <b>companies,</b> analysis of the companies leverage and tax rate shows that <b>diversified</b> <b>companies</b> have, on average 13 % lower debt-to-assets ratio and pay 4. 13 % lower tax rate than focused companies. It suggests that higher leverage, which gives companies greater tax shield, is not one the sources for the observed higher premium. It, however, indicates that a lower tax derived by combining businesses with imperfectly correlated cash flows {{can be one of the}} contributing factors for the value gain. A comparison of Price-to-Earning and Price-to-Book value ratios for the sample <b>diversified</b> and focused <b>companies</b> suggests, in contradiction with the above results, that focused companies perform better than <b>diversified</b> <b>companies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Corporate {{strategy}} {{forms the}} foundation {{when considering the}} strategic alternatives available to an organisation. Corporate diversification and specialisation {{are two of the}} more popular configurations often proposed by corporate strategy theory in order to grow and sustain financial performance. The {{issue of whether or not}} diversification leads to financial performance has been debated since the early 1950 s. Ample research has been conducted from an international perspective. However, the findings have been inconclusive/mixed/inconsistent and there remains a lack of consensus regarding the diversification-performance relationship. This study attempts to provide clarity on the matter by using a quantitative method to assess the financial performance of companies listed on the industrial sector of the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE) for the period 2003 to 2010. Thirty-nine companies met the criteria for inclusion in the sample and were classified as either focused, moderately or highly diversified. Three financial measures were compared for the different categories, namely return on average equity, return on average assets and market return. Two of the three hypotheses are not statistically significant and the differences in the average (mean) performance measures are due to sampling error. One of the performance measures, return on assets, indicates that the difference in the ii average (mean) performance is statistically significant. The pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences between highly and moderately <b>diversified</b> <b>companies</b> as well as between moderately <b>diversified</b> and focused <b>companies.</b> The mean difference between focused and highly <b>diversified</b> <b>companies</b> was not statistically significant. In this regard, moderately <b>diversified</b> <b>companies</b> performed better than highly <b>diversified</b> and focused <b>companies.</b> Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.
