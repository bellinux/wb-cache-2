5|$|In July 2015, Angle was {{expected}} to make an appearance at London Comic Con in England but his management team tweeted that Angle underwent emergency surgery to remove fluid buildup on his spinal cord after all of his extremities went numb. A week before this emergency, he had surgery to remove a benign tumor <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nigerian guerrillas {{arrive at}} a small village, grab a young boy named Yemi and try {{to force him to}} shoot an old man. The boy hesitates and his older brother, Eko, takes the gun and shoots the man himself, thus saving his brother from the act. The guerrillas are pleased with this, and force him to join their group, tearing his Christian cross <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> which is then taken by Yemi.|$|E
5|$|The present bronze {{statue of}} Benavides {{is in front}} of the Main Building of the Sampaloc campus, rising on top of a granite {{pedestal}} flanked by four lions each bearing the coats-of-arms of the Philippines, Spain, Holy See, and the Dominican Order. He dons the rugged habit of the pioneer Dominican missionaries. His right hand is elevated in the preaching fashion, his index finger pointing to heavens. His left hand rests on his chest holding a book bearing the words Santo Evangélico on its cover. A skull cap covers his head, and a pectoral cross hangs <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> the symbols of Episcopal dignity.|$|E

5|$|Dougie steals the deputy's {{wedding ring}} and knocks over a {{container}} of Epsom salts into the tub where the unconscious Greer is soaking after Scully removed several specimens <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> wounds. While Angela Villareal relieves herself, she spots the creature in the tub with the deputy. Mulder and Scully enter the bathroom and find the clothes of the deputy but the man gone. Mulder theorizes that the entity does not just live in water but is a living form of water, becoming visible only when it attacks. He believes that the creature uses people as hosts to reproduce, with the body's water content being used to feed the growth of new creatures. Mulder realizes that everyone needs to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|To crown {{all this}} , {{what is left}} but the amphitheatre? And this disgrace of the city you have as well—Gracchus not {{fighting}} as equipped as a Mirmillo, with buckler or falchion (for he condemns—yes, condemns and hates such equipment). Nor does he conceal his face beneath a helmet. See! he wields a trident. When he has cast without effect the nets suspended from his poised right hand, he boldly lifts his uncovered face to the spectators, and, easily to be recognized, flees across the whole arena. We can not mistake the tunic, since the ribbon of gold reaches <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> and flutters in the breeze from his high-peaked cap. Therefore, the disgrace, which the Secutor had to submit to, in being forced to fight with Gracchus, was worse than any wound.|$|E
5|$|Having {{left the}} others, Xavier {{returns to the}} safe room and finds a colored number {{on the back of}} Gus's neck. After realizing the answer to the clue, he kills Jonas with a spiked bat for his number after a brief fight and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent after finding the clue {{revealing}} Daniel's identity. Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box housing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades, and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room which leads to a dilapidated bathroom with two rotting corpses. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he can't read his own number, and he cuts the skin <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> As he approaches, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps up and slashes his neck with a hacksaw, killing him.|$|E

25|$|Chhinnamasta, a self-decapitated Hindu goddess, is {{depicted}} holding {{her head with}} three jets of blood spurting out of her bleeding neck, which are drunk by her severed head and two attendants. Saint Miliau, a Christian martyr killed c. 6th century AD, is sometimes represented holding his severed head, as in the retable of the Passion of the Christ at Lampaul-Guimiliau, where blood gushes <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} day of the convention, a group of protesters stood in front of {{approximately}} 30 to 40 delegates from Connecticut in an attempt to prevent them from entering the convention. Paramedics had to treat an 83-year-old member of the delegation for breathing problems when his credentials were ripped <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> by a protester. Additionally, a black bloc smashed windows of downtown businesses and slashed the tires several police cars, lit one police car on fire, and used a garbage dumpster as a battering ram against another. About 12 protesters were arrested.|$|E
25|$|Perry {{remained}} {{outside the}} secure room lying in wait, knife in hand, {{for a visit}} from the pirates who were trying to locate the missing crew members in order to gain control of the ship and presumably sail it to Somalia. Perry tackled the ringleader of the pirates and took him prisoner after a cat-and-mouse chase in a darkened engine room. Pirate ringleader Abduwali Muse cut his hand trying to keep Perry's knife away <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> The pirate was then tied up and his wounds were treated by Second Mate Ken Quinn.|$|E

60|$|Stoutenburg, {{with hands}} crossed over his chest, with head bare and collar impatiently torn away <b>from</b> round <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> was pacing {{up and down}} the long, low room like a caged beast of prey.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him in {{speechless}} amazement.

25|$|Beth (Kate Winslet) is {{a single}} businesswoman who goes {{on a blind date}} with Davis (Hugh Jackman), the city's most {{eligible}} bachelor. When the two arrive together at a restaurant, Beth is shocked when he removes his scarf, revealing a pair of testicles dangling <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> Over dinner it confuses her that Davis fails to acknowledge his anatomical abnormality, and that nobody seems to be surprised by it. When two friends of Davis (Roy Jenkins and Katie Finneran) come by, one of them convinces him to give Beth a kiss. Davis agrees, but when he kisses her, his neck-testicles are dangling near Beth's mouth, causing her to scream and budge out of the kiss.|$|E
25|$|On 9 October 2014, in the Penguins' {{first game}} of the 2014–15 season, Määttä {{recorded}} three assists in a 6–4 win over the Anaheim Ducks. During a press conference on 27 October, it was announced that Määttä would undergo surgery to remove a tumor <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> that could be a low-grade thyroid cancer. On 4 November, he underwent successful surgery and was expected to make a full recovery, and on 18 November, just two weeks after his surgery, it was announced that he would be returning to the Penguins lineup to play that night against the Montreal Canadiens. On 6 December, Määttä re-injured the same shoulder he had surgery on during the off-season—he would go on to miss 16 games before the Penguins would announce, on 13 January 2015, that he would miss the remainder of the season to have another surgery to repair the shoulder. During this time he was also diagnosed with the mumps.|$|E
500|$|Dinklage's {{face was}} injured in the early 1990s, {{when he was in}} a [...] "punk-funk-rap" [...] band called Whizzy.

The {{accident}} happened while he was playing at the nightclub CBGB in New York City, where he was accidentally kneed in the face and then started bleeding on the stage.|$|E
60|$|On <b>his</b> chest, {{suspended}} <b>from</b> around <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> {{hung the}} half of a china plate. Some forty similarly appareled blacks lay about the deck, fifteen of which were boat's crew, the remainder being fresh labor recruits.|$|R
60|$|The old {{man did not}} {{pause to}} remove the frame <b>from</b> about <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> Blood trickled down his {{forehead}} and cheeks from deep gashes that the broken glass had made. Now {{he was in a}} berserker rage.|$|R

500|$|In 1897 Synge had {{his first}} attack of Hodgkin's disease and also had an {{enlarged}} gland removed <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> The following year he spent the summer in the Aran Islands.

He also visited Brittany regularly. During this period he wrote his first play, When the Moon Has Set and sent it to Lady Gregory for the Irish Literary Theatre in 1900, but she rejected it. (The play was not published until it appeared in the Collected Works.) ...|$|E
500|$|Copeland {{has several}} tattoos: {{a red and}} black sun on his left upper biceps, which covers a tattoo of a muscular shark which resembled the Street Sharks; a star on his right upper biceps with several smaller stars and two skulls wearing bandanas, adorned with flowers and hearts, below said star tattoo; a tattoo of a cross on his left forearm; and another tattoo of a scroll like piece of paper adorned with the words [...] "Rise Above". All of Copeland's tattoos {{represent}} a stage in his career.

[...] The cross tattoo represents his time with the Brood, and his star and skull tattoos represent his Rated-R Superstar persona and his self-proclaimed status as the [...] "Guns N' Roses of wrestling".|$|E
500|$|Bligh {{was brought}} to the quarterdeck, his hands bound by a cord held by Christian, who was brandishing a bayonet; some reports {{maintained}} that Christian had a sounding plummet hanging <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> so that he could jump overboard and drown himself if the mutiny failed. Others who had been awakened by the noise left their berths and joined in the general pandemonium. It was unclear at this stage who were and who were not active mutineers. Hough describes the scene: [...] "Everyone was, more or less, making a noise, either cursing, jeering or just shouting for the reassurance it gave them to do so". Bligh shouted continually, demanding to be set free, sometimes addressing individuals by name, and otherwise exhorting the company generally to [...] "knock Christian down!" [...] Fryer was briefly permitted on deck to speak to Christian, but was then forced below at bayonet-point; according to Fryer, Christian told him: [...] "I have been in hell for weeks past. Captain Bligh has brought this on himself." ...|$|E
60|$|She encircled <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> {{with her}} arm, laid her cheek beside his chin, rejoiced boundlessly {{in the man}} {{roughness}} of his chin, of his coat-sleeve, the man scent of him--scent of tobacco and soap and hair. She opened her lips to his. Slowly she drew her arm <b>from</b> about <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>his</b> arm <b>from</b> about her waist.|$|R

60|$|Then {{he stood}} up on his throne and bowed towards me, kissing the air as though to a god, and taking the royal chain that every Inca wore <b>from</b> about <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> set it upon mine. This done, turning, he left me without another word.|$|R
