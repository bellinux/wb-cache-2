500|$|Recent {{clinical}} and laboratory research by neurosurgeon Julian Bailes, M.D., {{and his colleagues}} from West Virginia University, has resulted in papers showing that dietary supplementation with omega-3 DHA offers protection against the biochemical brain damage that occurs after a traumatic injury.

[...] “The potential for DHA to provide prophylactic benefit to the brain against traumatic injury appears promising and requires further investigation.

A consistent scorer and creator of goals, he {{describes himself as a}} player who can find gaps in the opposition defence but not particularly good at dribbling or one-on-ones. Müller describes this role as Raumdeuter, a term that translates to [...] "interpreter of space" [...] (cf. Raumdeuter, [...] "space interpreter"). During 2014 World Cup, Germany manager Joachim Löw stated that Müller [...] "is a very unorthodox player and you can't really predict his lines of running, but he has one aim and that is 'how can I score a goal?".|$|E

Ohlmeyer said he believed a better timeslot, less dense stories and less hand-held photography would attract more viewers and help the show succeed better: [...] "For it to succeed long-term, there's a humanity {{that needs to be}} brought to the characters.

These factors cause inflammation, apoptosis and eventually fibrosis of liver cells. Why this occurs {{in only a few}} individuals is still unclear.

2500|$|Usually {{dated to}} around 800, {{although}} sometimes up to a century earlier, {{the place of}} origin is disputed between Iona and Kells, or other locations. It is also often {{thought to have been}} begun in Iona and then continued in Ireland, after disruption from Viking raids; the book survives nearly intact but the decoration is not finished, with some parts in outline only. [...] It is far more comprehensively decorated than any previous manuscript in any tradition, with every page (except two) having many small decorated letters. [...] Although there is only one carpet page, the incipit initials are so densely decorated, with only a few letters on the page, that they rather take over this function. [...] Human figures are more numerous than before, though treated in a thoroughly stylised fashion, and closely surrounded, even hemmed in, by decoration as crowded as on the initial pages. [...] A few scenes such as the Temptation and Arrest of Christ are included, as well as a Madonna and Child, surrounded by angels (the earliest Madonna in a Western book). [...] More miniatures may have been planned or executed and lost. [...] Colours are very bright and the decoration <b>has</b> <b>tremendous</b> energy, with spiral forms predominating.

2500|$|The cast was {{announced}} between March and August 2014, with Idris Elba being announced to voice Shere Khan during early stages and Bill Murray eventually confirmed {{as the voice}} of Baloo in August 2014. Between then, Scarlett Johansson, Ben Kingsley, and Christopher Walken were confirmed to play Kaa, Bagheera, and King Louie. Favreau decided to cast Johansson to play Kaa, originally a male character, as he felt the original film was [...] "a little too male-oriented." [...] Favreau and Marks noticed the lack of female characters in the 1967 film version and wanted to address that by featuring Raksha's character more prominently, as in Kipling's tales. Lupita Nyong'o was cast as Raksha as Favreau believed her voice imbued the emotion required for the role, [...] "Lupita <b>has</b> <b>tremendous</b> depth of emotion in her performance. There's an emotional underpinning she brings, and a strength, and we wanted that for this surrogate mother. Much of that comes from her voice." [...] Favreau also decided to change King Louie from an orangutan to a Gigantopithecus {{due to the fact that}} orangutans are not native to India, where the story takes place. His character was given a slight alteration from the 1967 film and was partly inspired by Marlon Brando's character Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, as well as incorporating Walken's own physical mannerisms. In regards to Louie's changes, Favreau stated, [...] "We created this looming figure that was trying to extract the secret of fire from Mowgli. And also this gave Mowgli the idea that if he had fire, he could have power over Shere Khan, whether it was good or bad. So there was aLord of the Rings aspect to that; the fire was almost like the ring in that was going to give someone ultimate power, but corrupt them as well as create destruction." [...] The film is dedicated to Garry Shandling, who voiced a porcupine in the film and died of a heart attack before the film's release.|$|E
