The objective of these reforms has been to achieve a reduction of the credit risk associated with the growth in intraday credit exposures that arises in net settlement systems and in real-time <b>gross</b> <b>systems</b> when the central bank provides daylight overdrafts. Intraday payments-related credit in net settlement systems has been reduced by restructuring payment <b>systems</b> into real-time <b>gross</b> settlement <b>systems</b> with collateralized overdrafts, while in the existing real-time <b>gross</b> settlement <b>systems,</b> the risk-abatement program currently in effect has taken the form of caps and charges on uncollateralized daylight credit. ...|$|R

5000|$|The factory-quoted {{horsepower}} {{rating of}} [...] {{was measured using}} the SAE (<b>gross)</b> <b>system</b> current in the USA {{at the time the}} 420/Sovereign was sold there. The SAE (<b>gross)</b> <b>system</b> excluded many accessory drives and often used non-standard induction and exhaust systems and so was replaced by the more accurate SAE (net) system in 1972, long after the 420/Sovereign had gone out of production. Reference states that the DIN horsepower rating of the 1977 USA specification 4.2-litre Series II XJ6 was equivalent to 180 bhp. The DIN system yields horsepower ratings which, for most technical purposes, are the same as those that would be obtained using the SAE (net) system. However, the 1977 test would have included power-sapping emissions equipment not present on the 420/Sovereign. Therefore, the SAE (net) power rating of the 420/Sovereign must have lain somewhere between 180 bhp and 245 bhp.|$|R

40|$|While net {{settlement}} systems {{make more}} {{efficient use of}} liquidity than <b>gross</b> settlement <b>systems,</b> they are known to generate systemic risk. What does that tendency imply for {{the stability of the}} payments (or financial) system when the two settlement systems coexist? Do liquidity shortages induce banks to settle more transactions in the net settlement system, thereby increasing systemic risk? Or do banks require their counterparties to send payments through the <b>gross</b> settlement <b>system</b> when default risks are high, increasing the need for liquidity and the money market rate but reducing overall systemic risk? This paper studies the factors that drive the relative importance of net and <b>gross</b> settlement <b>systems</b> over the short run, using daily data on transaction volumes from the large- volume payment systems of all euro area countries that have had both a net and a <b>gross</b> settlement <b>system</b> at the same time. Applying a large portfolio of different econometric techniques, we find that it is actually the transaction volumes in <b>gross</b> settlement <b>systems</b> that affect the daily price of liquidity and the credit risk spread in money markets.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to make a {{comparative}} analysis of modern gross and net payment systems, emphasizing the implications of the availability of intraday liquidity in the former, and of collateral requirements in the latter. In contrast to previous models, an economy with two assets is described: eligible as collateral and not eligible, with the aim of being able to determine the implications of the requirement of these guarantees on banks' portfolio decisions—which affects their return—and on the probability and the consequences of a systemic crisis. This allows for comparison of the effects on social welfare of each of the two systems for different sets of parameters that characterize social risk aversion, opportunity set of banks, and the functioning of each settlement model. In a calibration exercise, it is shown how it would be legitimate for a benevolent authority to have a preference for a <b>gross</b> <b>system,</b> like TARGET, over a net system, like EURO 1, for relatively high values, although plausible, of risk aversion.
