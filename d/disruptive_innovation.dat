25|$|According to Clayton Christensen, <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovation</b> {{is the key}} {{to future}} success in business. The {{organisation}} requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage. It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation. Executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage. It is a time of risk but even greater opportunity. The world of work is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive. Companies will have to downsize and re-engineer their operations to remain competitive. This will affect employment as businesses will be forced {{to reduce the number of}} people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more.|$|E
25|$|Startups usually need to form {{partnerships}} with other firms to enable their business model to operate. To become attractive to other businesses, startups need to align their internal features, such as management style and products {{with the market}} situation. In their 2013 study, Kask and Linton develop two ideal profiles, or also known as configurations or archetypes, for startups that are commercializing inventions. The inheritor profile calls for a management style that is not too entrepreneurial (more conservative) and the startup should have an incremental invention (building on a previous standard). This profile is {{set out to be}} more successful (in finding a business partner) in a market that has a dominant design (a clear standard is applied in this market). In contrast to this profile is the originator which has a management style that is highly entrepreneurial and in which a radical invention or a <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovation</b> (totally new standard) is being developed. This profile is set out to be more successful (in finding a business partner) in a market that does not have a dominant design (established standard). New startups should align themselves to one of the profiles when commercializing an invention {{to be able to find}} and be attractive to a business partner. By finding a business partner a startup will have greater chances to become successful.|$|E

2500|$|While <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovation</b> will {{typically}} [...] "attack {{a traditional}} business {{model with a}} lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly," [...] foundational innovation is slower, and typically {{has the potential to}} create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term. Foundational innovation tends to transform business operating models as entirely new business models emerge over many years, with gradual and steady adoption of the innovation leading to waves of technological and institutional change that gain momentum more slowly. [...] The advent of the packet-switched communication protocol TCP/IP—originally introduced in 1972 to support a single use case for United States Department of Defense electronic communication (email), and which gained widespread adoption only in the mid-1990s {{with the advent of the}} World Wide Web—is a foundational technology.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the concept}} of value (as well as [...] "book value") has evolved {{significantly}} since the 1970s. Book value is most useful in industries where most assets are tangible. Intangible assets such as patents, brands, or goodwill are difficult to quantify, and may not survive the break-up of a company. When an industry is going through fast technological advancements, {{the value of its}} assets is not easily estimated. Sometimes, the production power of an asset can be significantly reduced due to competitive <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovation</b> and therefore its value can suffer permanent impairment. One good example of decreasing asset value is a personal computer. An example of where book value does not mean much is the service and retail sectors. One modern model of calculating value is the discounted cash flow model (DCF), where the value of an asset is the sum of its future cash flows, discounted back to the present.|$|E
2500|$|Fashion is {{a multibillion-dollar}} {{industry}} that has considerable impact on the way ordinary people dress and present themselves and relies heavily on media and advertising to communicate the producer's preferences and goals and influence public perception through various types of promotion; at the same time, fashion can be influenced by social change and counter-trends outside the producer, retailer or advertiser's control. As fashion is driven by trends within and without the fashion industry, fashion blogs and other [...] "new media" [...] outside the control of traditional establishment represent a <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovation</b> to the social dynamics of mass media and fashion consumption in modern consumer society. It {{is likely that the}} blogosphere will have a considerable long-term influence on the industry, as the number of fashion based blogs continue to grow, with increasing numbers of consumers able to create and modify the media that they consume, and traditional producers and advertisers adapting their practices to avoid dilution of their own influence.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to shed some light on {{patterns}} of and major motives for the adoption of different types of <b>disruptive</b> learning <b>innovations</b> by Unisa academics. To realise the aim of the study, the following questions were addressed: What are the reasons for adopting <b>disruptive</b> learning <b>innovations?</b> What is the level of interaction with <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations?</b> What training do Unisa academics require on <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations?</b> A qualitative approach was adopted by conducting focus group interviews with 76 Unisa academics. The data was analysed using open and axial coding, where dominant themes from the discussions were identified and discussed in detail. The findings show that the interaction of Unisa lecturers with different technologies varied from technology to technology. The study also found that <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations</b> play a pivotal role in opening avenues and collapsing the transactional distance in an ODL institution. Some lecturers lack skill in using some technology, which is a cause for concern. Therefore, lecturers need to be trained in using technology and develop a good understanding of it to improve teaching and learning...|$|R

This description, however, is not quite right {{in the sense that}} technology fusion cannot be realized without preceding <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations</b> at the level of component technologies. In other words, technology fusion is not effective with available component technologies only. To be effective, we need to have <b>disruptive</b> component <b>innovations.</b> The existence of <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations</b> is a necessary condition for technology fusion to be realized. Only by the realization of technology fusion, can the market need be met and the demand for disruptive component technologies articulated and pulled into the market (Kodama and Shibata, 2015).|$|R
40|$|US {{employers}} are facing an unprecedented opportunity to contribute toward positive, <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations</b> in healthcare. The convergence of major trends will enable employers to exercise significant leverage in controlling healthcare costs and improving quality. US healthcare {{is ripe for}} <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations</b> - cheaper, simpler, more convenient products or services that start by {{meeting the needs of}} less demanding customers. Employers view the healthcare system as overbuilt and off-focus for the needs of the average employer and employee. There are powerful driving forces and some restraining forces on employer leverage over employee health initiatives. On balance, employers have an interest in and an opportunity to leverage <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations</b> in healthcare. One option that employers can use to leverage <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations</b> in healthcare is partnership with health management vendors. While traditionally this association has been an arms-length customer/supplier relationship, there is an effective process for development of strategic partnerships that employers can use to better exert their latent influence on healthcare. There are at least 5 critical success factors for effective employer-vendor partnerships: 1. establish a formalized strategic planning process; 2. gain commitment and support early in the process; 3. identify specific goals, objectives, and accountabilities; 4. clearly define the partner selection process; and 5. clarify partner roles and expectations.

5000|$|Christensen {{argues that}} <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations</b> can hurt successful, well-managed {{companies}} that are responsive to their customers and have excellent research and development. These companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations,</b> because the markets have very tight profit margins and {{are too small to}} provide a good growth rate to an established (sizable) firm.

40|$|AbstractDisruptive {{innovations}} {{of products}} and production systems {{have the potential to}} provide a leap in value for existing and new customers. However, companies in industrial markets face two major problems when bringing innovations to markets. First, companies often lack systematic customer integration in the product development process. Second, <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations</b> break with existing technologies and are therefore regularly beyond the scope of customers’ imagination due to its complexity and level of novelty. Hence, when customers evaluate new product concepts, they often cannot fully capture its benefits. By addressing these two problems, companies can promote the efficiency of the product development process and thereby the success of <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Disruptive</b> <b>innovations</b> {{tend to be}} {{produced}} by outsiders and entrepreneurs, rather than existing market-leading companies. The business environment of market leaders does {{not allow them to}} pursue <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations</b> when they first arise, because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from sustaining innovations (which are needed to compete against current competition). A disruptive process can take longer to develop than by the conventional approach and the risk associated to it is higher than the other more incremental or evolutionary forms of innovations, but once it is deployed in the market, it achieves a much faster penetration and higher degree of impact on the established markets.|$|R
40|$|Radical <b>innovation</b> and <b>disruptive</b> {{technologies}} are frequently heralded {{as a solution}} to delivering higher quality, lower cost health care. According to the literature on disruption, local hospitals and physicians (incumbent providers) may be unable to competitively respond to such 2 ̆ 2 creative destruction 2 ̆ 2 and alter their business models for a host of reasons, thus threatening their future survival. However, strategic management theory and research suggest that, under certain conditions, incumbent providers may be able to weather the discontinuities posed by the disrupters. This article analyzes 3 <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations</b> in service delivery: single-specialty hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and retail clinics. We first discuss the features of these innovations to assess how disruptive they are. We then draw on the literature on strategic adaptation to suggest how incumbents develop competitive responses to these <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations</b> that assure their continued survival. These arguments are then evaluated in a field study of several urban markets based on interviews with both incumbents and entrants. The interviews indicate that entrants have failed to disrupt incumbent providers primarily as a result of strategies pursued by the incumbents. The findings cast doubt on the prospects for these <b>disruptive</b> <b>innovations</b> to transform health care...|$|R
