5|$|Beginning {{near the}} end of the 2006 season, word began to surface that Favre was {{considering}} retirement. In fact, playing in Soldier Field against the arch-rival Bears in the season finale, Favre was given a standing ovation in the closing seconds of the Packer victory as a show of respect from Chicago fans to their longtime nemesis. Moments later at the postgame interview, he gave a tearful interview with an NBC Sports correspondent, where he admitted his <b>future</b> <b>was</b> still questionable. However, after much debate, he returned for the 2007 season, during which his <b>future</b> <b>was</b> once again in doubt and an oft-discussed topic, with many in the media speculating that if the Packers made the Super Bowl, Favre would indeed retire and hand the reins to the unproven but talented Aaron Rodgers, who was drafted two years earlier as Favre's heir-apparent. Ultimately, the Packers fell in the NFC Championship to the New York Giants (who in turn upset the heavily favored and previously undefeated New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII).|$|E
5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his <b>future</b> <b>was</b> aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is {{noteworthy}} that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom {{they wanted to see}} continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E
50|$|The {{evaluation}} strategy of <b>futures,</b> which may <b>be</b> termed call by <b>future,</b> <b>is</b> non-deterministic: {{the value of}} a <b>future</b> will <b>be</b> evaluated at some time between when the <b>future</b> <b>is</b> created and when its value is used, but the precise time is not determined beforehand and can change from run to run. The computation can start as soon as the <b>future</b> <b>is</b> created (eager evaluation) or only when the value is actually needed (lazy evaluation), and may be suspended part-way through, or executed in one run. Once {{the value of a}} <b>future</b> <b>is</b> assigned, it is not recomputed on <b>future</b> accesses; this <b>is</b> like the memoization used in call by need.|$|R

5|$|The entire Homicide cast {{returned}} {{for the second}} season.

5|$|An ankle injury, which Brandon {{picked up}} in a {{pre-season}} tour game against Scottish side Motherwell kept Brandon {{out of the side}} {{at the start of the}} 2008–09 season. This included a League Cup game against his old side Huddersfield Town on 12 August 2008, for which he was a spectator as Bradford lost 4–0. When he attempted to make a comeback, he injured his other ankle in a reserve game with Scunthorpe United and was forced to undergo the first operation of his career which kept him out until January 2009. Once he returned to training in January, his first team debut was again delayed after a shoulder injury suffered at home. He returned to action for the reserves against Doncaster Rovers in February, before making his long-awaited debut on 7 March 2009 against Aldershot Town with City three goals ahead in a game which finally finished 5–0. He finished the season playing seven games. However, City missed out on promotion and Brandon's <b>future</b> <b>was</b> cast into doubt because of the size of his contract and budget cuts at the club.|$|E
5|$|Archibald, 5th Earl of Rosebery, born in 1847, had {{inherited}} his title from his grandfather in 1868, when aged 21, {{together with an}} income of £30,000 a year. He owned 40,000acres (160km²) in Scotland, and land in Norfolk, Hertfordshire, and Kent. His father had {{died when he was}} eight and he had been brought up by his mother, who had subsequently married Harry Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland. His mother was a distant figure, and their relationship was always strained. The Earls of Rosebery, whose family name was Primrose, were old, if undistinguished, members of the Scottish aristocracy. Rosebery was considered to be strikingly handsome and immensely cultivated. He was highly intelligent, and a brilliant <b>future</b> <b>was</b> forecast for him by his tutors at both Eton and Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1975 season, Pryce's <b>future</b> <b>was</b> subject to much speculation. Rumour linked him with a drive at Lotus, the team run by Colin Chapman, who had been keeping an eye on Pryce's {{progress}} throughout 1973 and 1974. At the time, Lotus was experiencing financial difficulties and reports suggested that Shadow and Lotus would swap Pryce and Swede Ronnie Peterson. The trade was viewed as a good acquisition for both teams, as Pryce was considered a driver of the same ability as Peterson, but would cost Lotus less, while Peterson could attract sponsorship to the relatively new Shadow team. The deal never materialised, although Shadow team manager Alan Rees claims that it came very close to being completed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Futures</b> {{can easily}} <b>be</b> {{implemented}} in channels: a <b>future</b> <b>is</b> a one-element channel, {{and a promise}} {{is a process that}} sends to the channel, fulfilling the future. This allows <b>futures</b> to <b>be</b> implemented in concurrent programming languages with support for channels, such as CSP and Go. The resulting <b>futures</b> <b>are</b> explicit, as they must be accessed by reading from the channel, rather than only evaluation.|$|R
50|$|Some languages, such as Alice ML, define <b>futures</b> that <b>are</b> {{associated}} with a specific thread that computes the future's value. This computation can start either eagerly when the <b>future</b> <b>is</b> created, or lazily when its value is first needed. A lazy <b>future</b> <b>is</b> similar to a thunk, {{in the sense of}} a delayed computation.|$|R

5|$|Back to the <b>Future</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on July 3, 1985, grossing over $381 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1985. It won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film, and the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing, {{as well as}} receiving three additional Academy Award nominations, five BAFTA nominations, and four Golden Globe nominations, including Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy). Ronald Reagan even quoted the film in his 1986 State of the Union Address. In 2007, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, and in June 2008 the American Film Institute's special AFI's 10 Top 10 designated the film as the 10th-best film in the science fiction genre. The film {{marked the beginning of}} a franchise, with two sequels, Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990), as well as an animated series, , several video games and a forthcoming musical.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} about 30 people and was the first game at Human Entertainment to utilize a 3D graphics engine, although team veterans preferred to have used 2D graphics instead. At first, director Hifumi Kono was not interested in working on a sequel to the first Clock Tower, but after seeing the technical possibilities with newly released hardware of the time, he agreed. For Kono, {{one of the most difficult}} parts of developing Clock Tower was choosing the platform. At the time, the PlayStation and Sega Saturn were already on the market. The Saturn was seen as an icon of next-generation gaming with games like Virtua Fighter (1994). The PlayStation was new to the industry, and despite having a preliminary lead in popularity over the Saturn, its <b>future</b> <b>was</b> uncertain. Meanwhile, the Nintendo 64 was scheduled to arrive on the market soon, coming off the success of the Super Nintendo. Kono eventually settled on the PlayStation, and in retrospect considers it the best choice he could have made since the console's future success helped Clock Tower sell better than expected.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{exploited}} the accident {{to undermine the}} IK-1 concept, with Bajdak joining those criticising the aircraft. The three flights were not considered sufficient to give a verdict on the design, and the debate over its <b>future</b> <b>was</b> fierce. This placed significant pressure on the designers, as every element of the aircraft design was subsequently attacked. Eventually, it was generally agreed that the aircraft was well-designed, but it needed more testing. At this point, Ikarus decided to build a second prototype, as {{it was evident that}} the hand-sewn fabric seam on the wing had not stood up to the strain of aerobatics, and their workmanship was in question. The second prototype took 10 months to build, with the two designers closely involved.|$|E

40|$|<b>Futures</b> <b>are</b> {{special kind}} of values that allow the {{synchronisation}} of different processes. <b>Futures</b> <b>are</b> in fact identifiers for promised results of function calls that are still awaited. When the result {{is necessary for the}} computation, the process is blocked until the result is returned. We are interested in this paper in transparent first-class futures, and their use within distributed components. We say that <b>futures</b> <b>are</b> transparent if the result is automatically and implicitly awaited upon the first access to the value; and that <b>futures</b> <b>are</b> first-class if they can be transmitted between components as usual objects. Thus, because of the difficulty to identify future objects, analysing the behaviour of components using first-class transparent <b>futures</b> <b>is</b> challenging. This paper contributes with first a static representation for futures, second a means to detect local deadlocks in a component system with first class futures, and finally extensions to interface definitions in order to avoid such deadlocks...|$|R
5|$|During this time, Johnson's <b>future</b> <b>was</b> {{uncertain}} {{because his}} father was deeply in debt. To earn money, Johnson began to stitch books for his father, {{and it is likely}} that Johnson spent much time in his father's bookshop reading and building his literary knowledge. The family remained in poverty until Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left enough money to send Johnson to university. On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and fellow student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit.|$|E

Since Riefenstahl was the only child for several years, Alfred wanted her {{to carry on the}} family name and secure the family fortune. However, her mother, Bertha Ida (Scherlach), who had been a part-time seamstress before her marriage, had faith in Riefenstahl and believed that her daughter's <b>future</b> <b>was</b> in show business.

5|$|Michael J. Fox was {{the first}} choice to play Marty McFly, but he was {{committed}} to the show Family Ties.

Back to the <b>Future</b> <b>was</b> originally scheduled for a May 1985 release and it was late 1984 when it was learned that Fox would be unable to star in the film. Zemeckis' next two choices were C. Thomas Howell and Eric Stoltz. Stoltz impressed the producers enough with his earlier portrayal of Roy L. Dennis in Mask (which had yet to be released) that they selected him to play Marty McFly. Because of the difficult casting process, the start date was pushed back twice.|$|E
