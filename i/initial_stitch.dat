2500|$|A {{knitting}} needle or knitting pin {{is a tool}} in hand-knitting to produce knitted fabrics. [...] They generally have a long shaft and taper at their end, {{but they are not}} nearly as sharp as sewing needles. [...] Their purpose is two-fold. [...] The long shaft holds the active (unsecured) stitches of the fabric, to prevent them from unravelling, whereas the tapered ends are used to form new stitches. Most commonly, a new stitch is formed by inserting the tapered end through an active stitch, catching a loop (also called a bight) of fresh yarn and drawing it through the stitch; this secures the <b>initial</b> <b>stitch</b> and forms a new active stitch in its place. [...] In specialized forms of knitting the needle may be passed between active stitches being held on another needle, or indeed between/through inactive stitches that have been knit previously.|$|E
2500|$|Both knit and purl {{stitches}} may be twisted: usually once if at all, {{but sometimes}} twice and (very rarely) thrice. [...] When seen from above, the twist can be clockwise (right yarn over left) or counterclockwise (left yarn over right); these are denoted as right- and left-plaited stitches, respectively. [...] Hand-knitters generally produce right-plaited stitches by knitting or purling {{through the back}} loops, i.e., passing the needle through the <b>initial</b> <b>stitch</b> in an unusual way, but wrapping the yarn as usual. [...] By contrast, the left-plaited stitch is generally formed by hand-knitters by wrapping the yarn in the opposite way, rather than by {{any change in the}} needle. [...] Although they are mirror images in form, right- and left-plaited stitches are functionally equivalent. [...] Both types of plaited stitches give a subtle but interesting visual texture, and tend to draw the fabric inwards, making it stiffer. [...] Plaited stitches are a common method for knitting jewelry from fine metal wire.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to describe the tools and materials, the making techniques and the types of products which is produced by the crochet industry in the Pariaman city. The method used is a qualitative method. The type of data in the form of primary data and secondary data. Informants are the leaders and craftsmen each industry. The technique of collecting data through observation, interviews and documentation. Data analysis techniques are data reduction, data presentation, and conclusions. Extension of the validity of the data with observations, increased observation and triangulation. Result: Equipment and Materials used consist of a crochet hook with numbers 8, 9, 1 / 0 and 2 / 0, sewing machines, stitch machine and cotton yarn, white and cream, with a yarn numbering numbers 6 and 9. Process roll thread there are two ways, namely utilizing limbs and used yarn mill player. The USAge of crochet hook number 1 / 0 and 2 / 0 is for the yarn number 9. Crochet hook number 8 and number 9 for number 6. Yarn making technique used the <b>initial</b> <b>stitch,</b> chain stitch, tightly stitch, closely half stitch, single crochet, double crochet, and picot stitch. Type of connection used a regular crochet, irish crochet, american crochet, the crochet stitch. It produced tablecloths, cover gallon, souvenirs and products related to fashion...|$|E
2500|$|If {{they are}} not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled; {{this is known as}} ripping out, {{unravelling}} knitting, or humorously, frogging (because you 'rip it', this sounds like a frog croaking: 'rib-bit'). To secure a stitch, at least one new loop is passed through it. Although the new stitch is itself unsecured ("active" [...] or [...] "live"), it secures the stitch(es) suspended from it. A sequence of stitches in which each stitch is suspended from the next is called a wale. To secure the <b>initial</b> <b>stitches</b> of a knitted fabric, a method for casting on is used; to secure the final stitches in a wale, one uses a method of binding/casting off. During knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting.|$|R

Less predominant colors are greens, orchids, where the design called for them. In a flat weave, the Badding Rug uses many traditional motifs, such as the Grecian urn, acanthus leaves, a central medallion and a jewel border, but its overall design is original. The year the rug was created and the maker’s <b>initials</b> were <b>stitched</b> into a corner of the rug providing authentication within.|$|R
50|$|The {{cross stitch}} sampler is called {{that because it}} was {{generally}} stitched by a young girl {{to learn how to}} stitch and to record alphabet and other patterns to be used in her household sewing. These samples of her stitching could be referred back to over the years. Often, motifs and <b>initials</b> were <b>stitched</b> on household items to identify their owner, or simply to decorate the otherwise-plain cloth. In the United States, the earliest known cross-stitch sampler is currently housed at Pilgrim Hall in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The sampler was created by Loara Standish, daughter of Captain Myles Standish and pioneer of the Leviathan stitch, circa 1653.|$|R
40|$|A CAD/CAM {{tool for}} {{prototyping}} and small-scale production of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) devices {{based on the}} excimer laser ablation process has been developed. The system's algorithms use the 3 D geometry of a microstructure, defined as an STL file exported from a CAD model, and parameters that influence the process (laser fluence, pulse repetition frequency, number of shots per area, wall angle, stitching errors) to automatically generate a precise NC part program for the excimer laser machine. The performance of the system has been verified by NC part program generation for several 3 D microstructures and subsequent machining trials. An <b>initial</b> <b>stitching</b> error of 23. 4 ± 2. 2 -µm wide and 3. 4 ± 1. 5 -µm high was observed when the overlap size between adjacent volumes was zero, when ablating 100 × 100 -µm features in polycarbonate (PC) at a fluence of 0. 5 J/cm 2 using a workpiece-dragging technique. When {{the size of the}} overlap was optimised by a system based on optimal process parameters determined by the Taguchi design of experiment method (DOE), and incorporated in the mask design, the maximum stitching error was reduced to 13. 4 ± 2. 2 -µm wide and 1. 4 ± 0. 9 -µm high under the same conditions. By employing a hexagonal-shaped mask with incorporated size of the image overlap, reduced horizontal-stitching errors of 2. 4 ± 0. 2 -µm wide and 1. 4 ± 0. 2 -µm high were observed. The system simplifies part program creation and is useful for excimer laser operators who currently use a tedious trial and error process to create programs and complex masks to generate microstructure parts...|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} designs, distributed on 1 September 1863, differ somewhat {{from those}} legislated in March. This, the Roman eagle, wings outstretched, wearing the princely crown, carries the princely scepter in its right talon and the sword in its left; on its breast appears an open shield topped by the princely crown. On {{the left of}} the shield, over azure and gold, is the Wallachian eagle (a cross in its beak, in left profile and wearing the princely crown); on the right, over red and azure, is the Moldavian aurochs with a star between its horns. Hanging from the scepter and sword is a red ribbon with gold-embossed letters: “HONOR ET PATRIA” (“honor and Fatherland”). In the fly corners the prince’s <b>initial</b> is <b>stitched,</b> surrounded by a laurel wreath; all are golden. Each flag also had inscribed the unit that bore it. The cloth part was 122 centimeter long and 100 centimeter wide. A metal Roman eagle was affixed to the tip of the flagpole. Although the order of 19 March had the Moldavian symbol in the right, nevertheless the first on the shield is the Wallachian eagle. The design was most likely adopted due to customary usage that arose after Bucharest became the single capital in February 1862.|$|R
