40|$|The human tumor stem-cell assay {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the in vitro chemosensitivity of 27 evaluable samples to cisplatin and its analogues, iproplatin and carboplatin, {{as well as to}} BCNU, teniposide, vindesine, and <b>dibromodulcitol.</b> All agents exhibited some antitumor activity with the exception of <b>dibromodulcitol</b> (zero response out of 19 evaluable samples). Vindesine, BCNU, and carboplatin were the three most active compounds, with response rates of 29 %, 23 %, and 22 %, respectively. There was a lack of complete cross-resistance between carboplatin and cisplatin as well as between carboplatin and BCNU. Our data suggest that clinical studies with carboplatin and combinations of vindesine plus cisplatin and its analogues may be worthwhile. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

The response rates were 6 % (3 / 50) for AHC, 9 % (3 / 34) for DBD, and 14 % (7 / 49) for methyl-CCNU. Median survival times were 4, 5, and 6 months, respectively. Neither regimen appears to offer any advantage over methyl-CCNU as front-line therapy for patients with disseminated melanoma...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Background: This {{prospective}} semi-randomized {{study was}} undertaken {{to assess the}} effects and effectiveness of alkylating drugs in a preoperative setting. Patients and Methods: During a 6 -year period preceding February 2000, 80 patients with Stage II-IVa (AJCC 2002) squamous cell cancer of the oral cavity were treated. Thirty patients (Group N) received a combination of bleomycin, vincristine and methotrexate (BVM). In the alkylating group, thirty patients (Group A/M) received BVM and mitolactol (<b>dibromodulcitol),</b> while twenty patients (Group A/C) received BVM and cisplatin. Patients underwent surgery within 3 weeks after chemotherapy. Clinical response rate and tumour-free survival were investigated. Results: Clinical complete response was 30 %- 36 % (Group N-A). Partial response was 57 %- 56 % (Group N-A). Side-effects were moderate and reversible. Nausea, anaemia and leucopenia were observed in th...|$|E
40|$|Patients with objectively {{measurable}} {{soft tissue}} sarcomas, osteosarcomas, chondrosarcomas, and mesotheliomas {{were treated with}} <b>dibromodulcitol</b> (DBD) (180 mg/m 2 p. o. days 1 - 10 q 4 wks.). ICRF- 159 (300 mg/m 2 p. o. tid days 1 - 3 q 4 wks), or maytansine (MAYT) (1. 5 mg/m 2 I. V. q 3 wks.). Forty-five evaluable patients received DBD, 47 MAYT, and 37 ICRF- 159. Only patients who had had their histopathologic diagnoses confirmed by a pathology reference panel {{were included in the}} final analysis. Two patients had objective partial responses: a patient with osteosarcoma who responded to DBD and a patient with fibrosarcoma who had a partial response of brief duration to ICRF- 159. Approximately 70 % of the patients treated with each drug were of ECOG performance status 0 or 1, and over half had moderate or worse toxicity. It seems unlikely that these drugs have significant therapeutic activity for common mesenchymal malignancies...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and modes of}} action of <b>dibromodulcitol</b> (DBD) and cisplatin (CDDP) were studied in several model systems. Combination treatments produced a longer survival time in mice bearing P 388 solid lymphomas than either of the drugs alone. In the human metastatic melanoma HT- 168 xenograft model the combined application of DBD and CDDP was also very effective, inducing {{a reduction in the}} number and volume of metastatic nodules. For V 79 spheroids, DBD was mainly cytotoxic against the internal, quiescent cells, whereas cisplatin primarily killed cells in the proliferating, external regions of the spheroids. When combined, the drugs appeared to act synergistically throughout the spheroids. Studies on plasmid DNA showed that CDDP primarily generates cross-links, whereas single-strand breaks were dominant after DBD treatment. Upon using an assay for cleavage by restriction nuclease, antagonistic action of DBD and CDDP in combination may occur, nevertheless more strand breaks were always observed in these samples. These results suggest that the efficacy of combined DBD and CDDP is in part a result of 'spatial cooperation' by the drugs (i. e. affecting different cells) and in part the result of DNA damage produced by the combination treatments...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We tested {{adjuvant}} chemotherapy combining <b>dibromodulcitol</b> (DBD) and bischloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU) given postoperatively {{to adults}} with newly diagnosed supratentorial malignant gliomas. METHODS: We enrolled 269 patients, 255 {{of whom were}} eligible. After surgery, we treated all patients with radiation therapy, using a median dose of 60 Gy given in 30 fractions. After randomization, patients in the chemotherapy group also received (1) six weekly courses, administered during irradiation, of DBD 700 mg/m 2 and (2) one to nine (median, four) courses, administered {{during the first year}} following radiation therapy, of DBD 1, 000 mg/m 2 on day 1 and BCNU 150 mg/m 2 on day 2, with the course being repeated every 6 weeks. RESULTS: Patients treated with radiation therapy along with DBD plus BCNU (group 2) had significantly longer survival time (p = 0. 044) and time to progression (p = 0. 003) than did those treated with radiation therapy alone (group 1). The median survival time was 13. 0 months for group 2 and 10. 4 months for group 1; the median time to progression was 8. 1 months for group 2 and 6. 7 months for group 1. The percentage of patients alive at 18 and 24 months was 34 % and 21 % in group 2 compared with 21 % and 12 % in group 1. CONCLUSION: DBD plus BCNU is an effective adjuvant therapy for malignant glioma.

40|$|Twenty six (17 males) {{patients}} with glioblastoma (GBL), median age 55 years, median Karnofsky Index (KI) 70 / 100, and 11 patients (9 males) with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), median age 56 years, median KI 70 / 100 were treated at recurrence with <b>dibromodulcitol</b> (DBD) 1400 mg/m 2 on day 1, BCNU 150 mg/m 2 on day 2, and procarbazine (PCZ) 150 mg/day on days 1 to 15. The course was repeated every 4 weeks, but was delayed or decreased by 25 % according to hematological toxicity. Response to treatment was {{evaluated by the}} criteria of MacDonald et al. (J Clin Oncol 1990; 8 : 1277 - 1280). All GBL-patients were followed until death. One patient with complete response (CR) survived one year, and 2 {{patients with}} partial response (PR) survived 1 and 3 years. Ten patients who stabilized (SD) survived 7. 5 months, and 13 patients who progressed under chemotherapy had a median survival of 3. 5 months. In AA-group 3 patients were alive {{at the time of}} the analyses. Six patients: 1 CR and 5 PR survived 6 to 40 + months. Two patients with SD survived 4 and 14 months. Three patients with progressive disease had a mean survived of less than 3 months. The response rate of 55 % in AA was significantly higher (p = 0. 011) than the 12 % response rate seen in GBL. We conclude that the regimen tested appears particularly promising in AA. The results in GBL are comparable to those obtained with a single nitrosourea, despite an increased but reversible toxicity.

40|$|Background: In a {{previous}} randomised EORTC study on adjuvant <b>dibromodulcitol</b> (DBD) and bichloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU) in adults with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), a clinically significant trend towards a longer overall survival (OS) and a progression-free survival (PFS) {{was observed in}} the subgroup of AA. The aim {{of the present study}} was to test this adjuvant regimen in a larger number of AA patients. Methods: Continuation of the previous phase III trial for newly diagnosed AA according to the local pathologist. Patients were randomised to either radiotherapy only or to radiotherapy in combination with BCNU on day 2 and weekly DBD, followed by adjuvant DBD and BCNU in cycles of six weeks for a maximum total treatment duration of one year. OS was the primary end-point. Results: Patients (193) with newly diagnosed AA according to local pathological assessment were randomised to radiotherapy (RT) alone (n = 99), or to RT plus DBD/BCNU (n = 94); 12 patients were considered not eligible. At central pathology review, over half (53 %) of the locally diagnosed AA cases could not be confirmed. On intent-to-treat analysis, no statistically significant differences in OS (p = 0. 111) and PFS (p = 0. 087) were observed, median OS after RT was only 23. 9 months 95 % confidence interval (CI), [18. 4 - 34. 0] after RT plus DBD/ BCNU 27. 3 months 95 % CI [21. 4 - 46. 8]. Conclusion: No statistically significant improvement in survival was observed after BCNU/ DBD adjuvant chemotherapy in AA patients. The trend towards improved survival is consistent with previous reports. Central pathology review of grade 3 tumours remains crucial. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a single-arm phase II study {{to evaluate the}} efficacy and safety of radiotherapy combined with 6 -thioguanine, procarbazine, <b>dibromodulcitol,</b> lomustine, and vincristine (TPDCV) chemotherapy for treating malignant astrocytoma in children and anaplastic ependymoma in patients of all ages. Between 1984 and 1992, 42 patients who had malignant astrocytomas (glioblastomas multiforme, anaplastic astrocytomas, or mixed anaplastic oligoastrocytomas) were treated with TPDCV chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Of these patients, 40 were younger than 18 years, but 2 were older (22 and 23 years) when treated. Cranial radiation averaged 58 Gy. TPDCV chemotherapy was given for 1 year or until progression. Between 1989 and 1991, 17 patients with malignant ependymoma were treated with TPDCV chemotherapy and craniospinal radiation. Radiation was given at an average dose of 54 Gy to the tumor, 28 Gy to the whole brain, and 31 Gy to the spinal axis. TPDCV chemotherapy was given for 1 year or until tumor progressed. Of the patients with glioblastoma multiforme, 13 of 17 died; the median time to progression was 49 weeks, and median survival was 85 weeks. The four patients surviving at this writing were followed a median 537 weeks (range 364 - 635 weeks). Of the patients with nonglioblastoma malignant astrocytoma, 14 of 25 died; the median time to progression was 224 weeks. Median survival was not reached in this group. The median follow-up for those surviving was 494 weeks. For the patients with ependymoma, 11 of 17 died with a median time to progression of 141 weeks. The median follow-up for the eight who survive was 469 weeks. Nine patients died with a median survival of 183 weeks. The combination of TPDCV and radiotherapy has activity against childhood anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and anaplastic ependymoma. The {{results of this study}} for children with glioblastoma were comparable to results in the literature, while the results for children with anaplastic astrocytoma appeared better than most reports. The combination of TPDCV chemotherapy and radiation therapy for anaplastic ependymomas appears to be active and at least as good as published reports using radiation therapy alone...|$|E
