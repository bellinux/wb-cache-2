Section  4.2 deals with the solution set <b>for</b> <b>inclusions</b> (1.1) in a compact interval as a nonempty compact R_δ-set in the case when the semigroup is noncompact. Then we switch onto studying the R_δ-structure of the solution set of (1.1) on a noncompact interval.|$|R

A similar result to the one presented above {{can be found in}} [[58], Theorem  2.1] in a direct form of difference inclusions. In [59] difference inclusions are used to solve some problems in optimal control theory. In particular, it was proved that any solution <b>for</b> autonomous differential <b>inclusions</b> can be approximated by a sequence of solutions <b>for</b> difference <b>inclusions</b> (the multifunction G is assumed to be bounded and Lipschitz). A brief discussion of other motivations <b>for</b> difference <b>inclusions</b> can be found in [60] (see also the references therein). We refer to [61] for a full survey of difference methods <b>for</b> differential <b>inclusions.</b> Also, the problem <b>for</b> difference <b>inclusions</b> was investigated in the case of impulsive differential <b>inclusions</b> ([62], <b>for</b> instance) and in this setting our approach seems to be natural and does not require separate studies.|$|R

5|$|In October and November 2004, the IOC {{established}} an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic programme and all non-Olympic recognised sports. The {{goal was to}} apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic programme for each celebration of the Games. The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic programme. These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport. From this study five recognised sports emerged as candidates <b>for</b> <b>inclusion</b> at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash. These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended <b>for</b> <b>inclusion</b> only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash. Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic programme. In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games.|$|E
