5|$|Secretariat's {{absence of}} major {{conformation}} flaws was important, as horses with well made limbs and feet {{are less likely}} to become injured. Secretariat's hindquarters were the main source of his power, with a sloped croup that extended the length of his femur. When in full stride, <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The croupade and {{ballotade}} are predecessors to the capriole. In the croupade, {{the horse}} jumps with both fore and hind legs remaining tucked under {{the body and}} he does not kick out. In the ballotade, the horse jumps and untucks <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> legs slightly, he does not kick out, but the soles of the hind feet are visible if viewed from the rear.|$|E
500|$|Black Allan was foaled in Lexington, Kentucky in 1886, {{out of the}} Morgan mare Maggie Marshall and by Allendorf, who {{descended from}} Hambletonian lines. Black Allan was a black {{stallion}} standing , with a sock on <b>his</b> left <b>hind</b> foot, coronet on <b>his</b> right <b>hind</b> foot, and a star on his forehead. [...] He was registered with the American Trotting Registry and given registration number 7623.|$|R

5|$|Reproduction in giraffes is broadly polygamous: a few older males {{mate with}} the fertile females. Male giraffes assess female {{fertility}} by tasting the female's urine to detect oestrus, in a multi-step {{process known as}} the flehmen response. Males prefer young adult females over juveniles and older adults. Once an oestrous female is detected, the male will attempt to court her. When courting, dominant males will keep subordinate ones at bay. A courting male may lick a female's tail, rest his head and neck on her body or nudge her with his horns. During copulation, the male stands on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> legs with his head held up and his front legs resting on the female's sides.|$|E
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E

5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live {{models for the}} eastern {{chipmunk}} characters, or borrowed a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have been}} unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced to follow suit and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) in imitation of a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> legs while wearing his blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock, still unnamed, had {{his first}} race as a three-year-old in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster on Monday 22 September. He did not arrive at Doncaster until the Saturday before, and after reports that he was amiss his odds had {{lengthened}} {{to as much as}} 10/1 in the betting. After arriving, he had a gallop in the afternoon and soon shortened in the betting. After another of the pre-race favourites, Stainborough, was withdrawn due to illness Blacklock was sent off as the short-priced favourite at about evens. Blacklock appeared {{like he was going to}} win easily and Jackson eased him up in the final furlong (200 metres) of the race. However, Ebor and Restless began to quickly close down his lead. By the time Jackson realised, Blacklock could not accelerate quick enough and Ebor came out on top, beating Blacklock by a neck. Restless finished in third place and was the only other runner that could be placed by the judge. Blacklock had a crack in one of <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> heels, which was thought to have affected him in the race.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{aggregate}} {{in large}} numbers (>20 individuals) under rocks and logs along the immediate edge of the breeding sites and breed explosively over a few days. Suitable breeding sites include small fish-free ponds, marshes, shallow lakes and other still-water wetlands. Like other ambystomatid salamanders, they have evolved a characteristic courtship dance where they rub bodies and release pheromones from their chin gland prior to assuming a copulatory mating position. Once in position, the male deposits a spermatophore, which is a gooey stalk tipped with a packet of sperm, and walks the female forward to be inseminated. Males may mate more than once and may deposit as many as 15 spermatophores {{over the course of}} a five-hour period. The courtship dance for the long-toed salamander is similar to other species of Ambystoma and very similar to A.jeffersonianum. In the long-toed salamander, there is no rubbing or head-butting; the males directly approach females and grab on, while the females try to rapidly swim away. The males clasp the female from behind the forelimbs and shake, a behavior called amplexus. Males sometimes clasp other amphibian species during breeding and shake them as well. The male only grabs with the front limbs and never uses <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> limbs during the courtship dance as he rubs his chin side to side pressing down on the female's head. The female struggles but later becomes subdued. Males increase the tempo and motions, rubbing over the female's nostrils, sides, and sometimes the vent. When the female becomes quite docile the male moves forward with his tail positioned over her head, raised, and waving at the tip. If the female accepts the males courtship, the male directs her snout toward his vent region while both move forward stiffly with pelvic undulations. As the female follows, the male stops and deposits a spermatophore, and the female will move forward with the male to raise her tail and receive the sperm packet. The full courtship dance is rarely accomplished in the first attempt. Females deposit their eggs a few days after mating.|$|E
50|$|After <b>his</b> arrest, <b>Hinds</b> {{brought a}} lawsuit against {{authorities}} charging the prison commissioners with illegal arrest and used the incident {{as a means to}} plan his next escape by having a padlock smuggled in to him while at the Law Courts. Two guards escorted him to the toilet, but when they removed <b>his</b> handcuffs <b>Hinds</b> bundled the men into the cubicle and snapped the padlock onto screw eyes that his accomplices had earlier fixed to the door. He escaped into the crowd on Fleet Street but was captured at an airport five hours later.|$|R

2500|$|At maturity, Dan Patch stood [...] tall at the withers {{and weighed}} a [...] "hefty" [...] 1,165 pounds. His {{hindquarters}} were notably higher than his front. He {{had a short}} body and long legs, a combination {{that would have been}} problematic for a trotter as the hind legs would have risked striking the front leg in full stride (known as firing). As a pacer, the risk of firing is non-existent as the front and hind legs on a given side move back and forth together. However, because of the crooked hock on <b>his</b> left <b>hind,</b> Dan Patch would initially [...] "cross fire", meaning <b>his</b> left <b>hind</b> leg would sometimes hit his right fore. A special horseshoe was used on <b>his</b> left <b>hind</b> to stabilize the leg, resulting in a smooth, rhythmical stride. The left leg would still sometimes [...] "paddle" [...] wide though, striking the wheel of the training cart. Wattles resolved this problem by designing a wider sulky.|$|R

25|$|Faugheen is a bay gelding {{with a white}} blaze {{and white}} socks on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> legs bred in Ireland by Dr John Waldron. He was sired by Germany, an American-bred, German-trained horse who won the Grosser Preis von Baden and the Bayerisches Zuchtrennen in 1995.

25|$|A male Patagonian mara, {{a type of}} rodent, {{will stand}} on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> legs and urinate on a female's rump, to which the female may respond by {{spraying}} a jet of urine backwards {{into the face of}} the male. The male's urination is meant to repel other males from his partner while the female's urination is a rejection of any approaching male when she is not receptive. Both anal digging and urination are more frequent during the breeding season and are more commonly done by males.|$|E

25|$|Neo Universe is a {{bay horse}} {{standing}} 16.2 hands high {{with a white}} star and white socks on <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> feet, bred and raced by the Shadai Farm. He was sired by Sunday Silence, who won the 1989 Kentucky Derby, before retiring to stud in Japan where he was champion sire on thirteen consecutive occasions. Neo Universe's dam was the British-bred mare Pointed Path, making him a close relative of the European Group One winners Helen Street (Irish Oaks) and Shamardal. The colt was named after a song by the Japanese rock band L'Arc-en-Ciel. The colt was sent into training with the veteran Tsutomu Setoguchi, best known for handling the Japanese Horse of the Year Oguri Cap.|$|E
25|$|This {{species of}} {{capuchin}} is polygamous. The male mounts the female, holding her legs with <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> feet, and copulates {{with her for}} a few minutes. Although the time of gestation is unknown, it is probably around 160 days like the tufted capuchin. Usually one infant is born. Observations of a newborn in El Tuparro National Park showed {{the process by which}} the newborn discovered the appropriate position for riding on the mother. Newborns ride oriented sideways over the mothers' shoulders, but during the first days the baby holds on to any part of the mother such as the base of the tail, the tail, the legs, and the arms before discovering and learning that the position over the shoulders is best and most secure. After several weeks the baby makes the change from the sideways position over the shoulders to riding on her back.|$|E
500|$|The male {{bog turtle}} is {{territorial}} and will attack other males if they venture within [...] of his position. An aggressive male will crawl toward an intruder with his neck extended. As he approaches his foe, he tilts his carapace by withdrawing {{his head and}} raising <b>his</b> <b>hind</b> limbs. If the other male does not retreat, a fight of pushing and biting can follow. The bouts typically last just a few minutes, with the larger and older male usually winning. The female is also aggressive when threatened. She will defend the area around her nest, usually up to a radius of , from encroaching females, but when a juvenile approaches, she ignores it, and when a male appears she surrenders her area (except during mating season).|$|E
