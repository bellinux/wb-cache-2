5|$|In early 2015, the two again began {{showing signs}} of tension between them - with Stardust {{becoming}} further entrenched in his gimmick, leaving Goldust to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> communicate with his brother, Cody; through his new entity. Stardust would respond to this by walking out on Goldust before their match had concluded on the February 5 episode of SmackDown. On the February 16th edition of Raw - {{for the first time}} since their debut, Dusty Rhodes returned to speak to his sons as a way to commiserate and smooth out the problems they were having. Though at first Cody seemed to be in agreement with his family, after Goldust took the loss for his team against The New Day, Stardust hit his old finisher Cross-Rhodes thus dissolving their partnership entirely. After, when Dusty approached Stardust backstage, Stardust claimed that it was he and his brother that were responsible for the pressure Cody was subjected to from a young age. He then stated that Cody, and now his own family, were dead to him. A match between the two was set for Fastlane with Goldust promising to vanquish Stardust once and for all and to reclaim his brother and rekindle their partnership and brotherhood. Due to their father asking Goldust not to cause any real harm to Cody, Goldust won their first encounter via roll-up. Backstage, Stardust viciously assaulted Goldust and again proclaimed it was his family's fault for his mental decline.|$|E
25|$|For {{the general}} growth of cricket in the United States, {{it was most}} unfortunate that this {{pioneering}} tour occurred only 18 months before the American Civil War began. If the war had not broken out, it is highly likely that two or three follow-up tours might have been arranged in the early 1860s, thus building on the interest created by the initial trip. As it was, the enthusiasm for cricket faded in the war years and the troops on both sides adopted the embryonic game of baseball. When English teams resumed tours to America in 1868, {{not only did they}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> rekindle the enthusiasm, but in baseball they had a serious rival to contend with.|$|E
500|$|VanDerWerff deemed Spears' cameo [...] "totally useless," [...] {{criticizing the}} singer's [...] "flat, {{listless}} dialogue." [...] Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post graded her cameo a [...] "C," [...] commenting [...] "at least she didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be funny" [...] as in her How I Met Your Mother guest-spot. Flandez {{was disappointed that}} Spears did not appear for longer, yet he concluded that given the acting demonstrated in her 2002 film Crossroads, it was better that the pop star did not. Conversely, Jenna Mullins of E! Online appreciated the fact that Spears did not appear as a background character, writing that she is [...] "best when she is playing herself", Stack felt her appearances were well-handled, [...] "with a nice level of restraint," [...] and Canning felt they were kept to a [...] "perfect minimum." ...|$|E

500|$|The Treehouse of Horror episodes are {{difficult}} {{for both the}} writers and the animators. The episodes were originally written {{at the beginning of}} the production run, but in later seasons they were written at the end and aired {{at the beginning of the}} next season as holdovers, giving the animators more time to work. Part of the difficulty for the animators is that the episodes always involve many complex backgrounds, new characters, and new designs. They {{are difficult}} for the writers because they must produce three stories, an opening and, in the early episodes, a wraparound. They would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> fit all of this into a 20–22minute episode. The episodes often go through many last minute changes, with rewrites requiring new lines to be recorded. [...] "Treehouse of Horror III" [...] in particular underwent somewhere between 80 and 100 line changes in the six-week period between the arrival of the animation from Korea and the airing of the episode. By the fourth season, executive producers Al Jean and Mike Reiss were less enamored of Treehouse of Horror episodes and considered dropping them, but the other writers insisted that they be kept.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for Wasting Light were {{completed}} {{during the week}} each song was being recorded. Grohl said that the words were [...] "what was on my mind each week", most being [...] "written {{from the perspective of}} who I was then and who I am now", with references to the past, life and death, and [...] "time, but questioning whether it matters at all. There's so much focus on the before that people forget there's an after." [...] The frontman said this was helped by the environment - [...] "a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to the way we used to make records" [...] - and working with Vig again, which [...] "made me think a lot about starting over, and rebirth, and making your way through tragedy and coming out the other side." [...] An example was [...] "I Should Have Known", partially inspired by former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain - [...] "a song like 'I Should Have Known' is about all the people I've lost, not just Kurt". Grohl still tried to do laid-back songs such as [...] "White Limo", which had its lyrics written in just two minutes, specially after Mendel sent him an e-mail saying, [...] "I really like it when you write songs that are silly and mean nothing, too. You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> write 'Imagine' every time you sit down with a pen and paper".|$|E
2500|$|The Townhouse Explosion was {{the tragic}} and {{dramatic}} {{culmination of the}} grim political direction in which Weatherman had been headed.

2500|$|The March 6, 1970 Greenwich Village townhouse {{explosion}} was a {{culmination of}} the political direction in which Weatherman had been headed, according to Whitehorn. [...] “We were {{out of touch with}} what was going on, and we lost {{sight of the fact that}} if you’re a revolutionary, the first thing you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do is preserve human life." [...] Three Weathermen died in the explosion, Terry Robbins, Diana Oughton, and Ted Gold.|$|E
2500|$|Crick {{occasionally}} {{expressed his}} views on eugenics, usually in private letters. For example, Crick advocated a form of positive eugenics in which wealthy parents would be encouraged to have more children. He once remarked, [...] "In the long run, it is unavoidable that society will begin {{to worry about the}} character of the next generation... It is not a subject at the moment which we can tackle easily because people have so many religious beliefs and until we have a more uniform view of ourselves I think it would be risky to try and do anything in the way of eugenics... I would be astonished if, in the next 100 or 200years, society did not come round to the view that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> improve the next generation in some extent or one way or another." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Mullen's {{return and}} the sessions' {{resumption}} in February 1996, the production team of Flood, Howie B, and Hooper spent three months attempting to re-work {{much of the}} band's material to better incorporate loops and samples with their musical ideas from 1995. This period was a difficult one; Mullen, in particular, had to record drum parts to replace loops that Howie B had sampled without permission. Flood said, [...] "We took what we had and got the band to play to it and work it into their own idiom, while incorporating a dance ethic... The groove-orientated way of making music can be a trap when there's no song; you end up just plowing along on one riff. So you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get the groove and the song, and do {{it so that it}} sounds like the band, and do it so that it sounds like something new." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{basically}} raised myself," [...] Mayweather says. [...] "My grandmother {{did what}} she could. When she got mad at me I'd go to my mom's house. My life was ups and downs." [...] His father says he knows how much pain his incarceration caused his son, but insists he did the best he could. [...] "I sent him {{to live with his}} grandmother," [...] he says. [...] "It wasn't like I left him with strangers." [...] In the absence of his father, boxing became an outlet for Mayweather. As the elder Mayweather served his time, his son put all of his energy into boxing and dropped out of high school. [...] "I knew that I was going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> take care of my mom and I made the decision that school wasn't that important at the time and I {{was going to have to}} box to earn a living," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|The Beauty Stone was {{conceived}} as a musical drama different in style from the productions that had preceded it at the Savoy Theatre. [...] Sullivan's intention {{was to create a}} work halfway between the romantic flights of his grand opera Ivanhoe and the familiar humour of the earlier Savoy operas. [...] The composer, however, soon found that Carr's lyrics were unwieldy and difficult to set to music. [...] In mid-December 1897, he wrote in his diary that his collaborators were difficult; when he asked for changes {{in the construction of the}} piece, they refused to make the alterations. [...] He was forced to involve Helen Carte to mediate the disagreements with his collaborators. [...] Even so, Sullivan continued to be disappointed in what he had to work with. [...] In February 1898, he wrote in his diary: [...] "eartbreaking to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make a musical piece out of such badly constructed (for music) mess of involved sentences." [...] Nevertheless, after working further with Carr in March, he was able to work out the key difficulties, and his struggles with the complexity of the lyrics seems to have inspired some of Sullivan's longest melodic lines and interesting musical settings. [...] Rehearsals began early in April 1898.|$|E
2500|$|During {{its first}} three seasons in existence, Citi Field {{was known to}} play as a [...] "pitcher's park", and has been cited {{as the cause of}} the {{decreased}} offensive production of David Wright and Jason Bay. Wright hit only 10 home runs in 2009 after hitting at least 30 in the previous two seasons, while Bay had the worst offensive production of his career in his first season with the Mets in 2010, only hitting 6 home runs, 47 RBIs, and OBP of just [...]347, and a slugging percentage of a career low [...]402. Jeff Francoeur, who played with the Mets during their first two years at Citi Field, criticized the ballpark's dimensions, calling it [...] "a damn joke." [...] During the 2011 season, Citi Field allowed 1.33 home runs per game, the third lowest total out of the 16 National League ballparks. The team responded by altering the ballpark dimensions for the 2012 season, creating a more neutral ballpark. Wright's 2012 offensive numbers have improved due to the alterations. [...] "It's a huge difference", Wright said. [...] "It allows you to relax and know you don’t <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> hit the ball a mile to see results. And at the same time, if you do hit the ball well and you see results, instead of a 400-foot flyout, you’re 1-for-1 and feeling good about yourself." ...|$|E

5000|$|Since Clark's {{marriage}} to Redgrave ended in 2000 after a national scandal, he {{has stated that}} he has struggled with his career, saying, [...] "I've <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> reinvent myself.
