25|$|The {{mechanism}} for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference {{is built into}} the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents <b>DNA</b> <b>cleavage.</b> RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Transcription activator-like {{effector}} nucleases (TALEN) are restriction {{enzymes that}} can be engineered to cut specific sequences of DNA. They are made by fusing a TAL effector DNA-binding domain to a <b>DNA</b> <b>cleavage</b> domain (a nuclease which cuts DNA strands). Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) can be engineered to bind to practically any desired DNA sequence, so when combined with a nuclease, DNA can be cut at specific locations. The restriction enzymes can be introduced into cells, for use in gene editing or for genome editing in situ, a technique known as genome editing with engineered nucleases. Alongside zinc finger nucleases and CRISPR/Cas9, TALEN is a prominent tool {{in the field of}} genome editing.|$|E

Initial TALEN studies used the wild-type FokI cleavage domain, but some subsequent TALEN studies also used FokI cleavage domain variants with mutations designed to improve cleavage specificity and cleavage activity. The FokI domain functions as a dimer, requiring two constructs with unique DNA binding domains for sites in the target genome with proper orientation and spacing. [...] Both the number of amino acid residues between the TALE DNA binding domain and the FokI cleavage domain and the number of bases between the two individual TALEN binding sites appear to be important parameters for achieving high levels of activity.|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} role of reactive oxygen radicals in the hepatotoxicity associated with ethanol consumption. Reactive oxygen intermediates interact with DNA and can cause single-strand breaks of supercoiled DNA. Experiments were carried out to evaluate the utility of this system as a sensitive assay for the detection of potent oxidants generated by rat liver microsomes isolated from pair-fed control rats and rats treated chronically with ethanol. <b>DNA</b> strand <b>cleavage</b> was assayed by monitoring the migration of the supercoiled and open circular forms in agarose. Microsomes catalysed DNA strand breakage with either NADPH or NADH as cofactors; iron was required to catalyse the reaction and various ferric complexes were effective in promoting the reaction. <b>DNA</b> strand <b>cleavage</b> was prevented by catalase, superoxide dismutase, GSH and hydroxyl-radical-scavenging agents, suggesting that a hydroxyl-radical-like species was the oxidant responsible for the breakage. This assay system proved to be much more sensitive in detecting hydroxyl radicals than are other methods, such as e. s. r. spectroscopy or oxidation of chemical scavenging agents with respect to the amount of microsomal protein and the nature and concentration of the iron catalyst required. Microsomes from ethanol-treated rats were more reactive than control microsomes in catalysing the <b>DNA</b> strand <b>cleavage</b> with either NADPH or NADH; increased catalytic activity was observed with various ferric complexes and was sensitive to the above antioxidants. Compared with preimmune IgG, anti-(cytochrome P 4502 E 1) IgG had no effect on <b>DNA</b> strand <b>cleavage</b> by the control microsomes, but completely prevented the NADPH- and the NADH-dependent increased activity found with microsomes from the ethanol-treated rats. Inhibitors of cytochrome P 4502 E 1, such as diethyl dithiocarbamate and tryptamine, also lowered the extent of increase of <b>DNA</b> strand <b>cleavage</b> produced by microsomes from the ethanol-treated rats. These results indicate that <b>DNA</b> strand <b>cleavage</b> is a very sensitive assay for detecting the production of hydroxyl radicals by microsomes and to demonstrate increased activity by microsomes after chronic ethanol treatment.

This CSR-accessible domain {{is reminiscent of}} the promoter-defined domains that target somatic hypermutation. Within the 4 - 5 -kb CSR domain, the targeting of S site locations also depends on the Msh 2 mismatch repair protein because Msh 2 -deficient mice show an increased focus of sites to the Smu tandem repeat region.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Deoxyribosylnucleotide {{radicals}} with {{a radical}} {{center at the}} 4 ′-position are important intermediates in radical-induced <b>DNA</b> strand <b>cleavage.</b> In the presence of O 2, these <b>DNA</b> radicals yield <b>cleavage</b> products that are partly oxidized. In the past, the postulated peroxide intermediates could not be detected directly because they were unstable under the conditions of either radical generation, the work-up procedure, or the analytical techniques used. We set out to generate and analyze these crucial intermediates in radical-induced <b>DNA</b> strand <b>cleavage</b> under mild conditions. Results: Photolysis experiments with modified single-stranded oligonucleotides generated 4 ′-DNA radicals that were trapped by 02 Using MALDI-MS, DNA peroxides could be detected directly. Depending upon the precursor, these peroxides are formed either {{before or after the}} cleavage of the single-stranded DNA radical. Reactions in the presence of 18 O 2 and/or H 218 O as well as subsequent transformations to the oxidized cleavage products confirmed the structure of the DNA peroxides. Conclusions: Our technique of selective DNA radical generation under mild conditions makes it possible to detect labile reaction products of single-stranded DNA radicals and to gain further insight into their cleavage reactions. In cases where a radical pair is formed, the shielding effect protects the DNA radical from external attack so that cleavage of the single strand competes successfully with trapping by O 2. This shielding effect might be of general importance if the DNA radicals are generated by reagents that bind to the DNA...|$|R
