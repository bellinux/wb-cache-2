5000|$|In 1964, Suntour {{invented the}} slant-parallelogram rear derailleur, which let the <b>jockey</b> <b>pulley</b> {{maintain}} a more constant {{distance from the}} different sized sprockets, resulting in easier shifting. Once the patents expired, other manufacturers adopted this design, at least for their better models, and the [...] "slant parallelogram" [...] remains the current rear derailleur pattern.|$|E
50|$|In April 1953, Simplex added a {{variable}} speed automatic transmission with centrifugal shoe-type clutch and belt-type automatic transmission. The ratio was changed by {{expanding and contracting}} the drive pulley, with a low ratio of approximately 18:1 and a high ratio of approximately 7:1. The transmission was belt-driven and drove the real wheel by belt, with automatic belt tensioning by <b>jockey</b> <b>pulley.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{variations}} exist, {{as noted}} below, most rear derailleurs have several components in common. They have a cage that holds two pulleys that guide the chain in an S-shaped pattern. The pulleys {{are known as}} the <b>jockey</b> <b>pulley</b> or guide pulley (top) and the tension pulley (bottom). The cage rotates in its plane and is spring-loaded to take up chain slack. The cage is positioned under the desired sprocket by an arm that can swing back and forth under the sprockets. The arm is usually implemented with a parallelogram mechanism to keep the cage properly aligned with the chain as it swings back and forth. The {{other end of the}} arm mounts to a pivot point attached to the bicycle frame. The arm pivots about this point to maintain the cage at a nearly constant distance from the different sized sprockets. There may be one or more adjustment screws that control the amount of lateral travel allowed and the spring tension.|$|E
50|$|A single-speed bicycle is {{generally}} cheaper, lighter, and mechanically simpler than its multi-geared equivalent. Without derailleurs or other gearing systems, {{there are fewer}} parts on the bicycle that require maintenance, making this type of cycle useful for city commuting in all weather. The drivetrain efficiency of a single-speed can be greater than today's typical multi-geared bicycles. A straight chainline, lack of chain drag from rear derailleur <b>jockey</b> <b>pulleys,</b> and lack of chainrings, ramps and pins all improve efficiency. As a single rear cog takes less space than the typical seven to ten cogs present on most multi-geared rear cassettes, rear wheels can be built {{with little or no}} dish.|$|R
