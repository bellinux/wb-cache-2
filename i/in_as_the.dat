5|$|After Masai Ujiri {{was brought}} <b>in</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> new General Manager in 2013, he traded Bargnani to the New York Knicks. With a {{backcourt}} led by Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, the Raptors {{returned to the}} playoffs, won their second Atlantic Division title, and won a then-franchise record 48 games in the 2013–14 season. However, they failed for a fourth consecutive time to advance beyond {{the first round of}} the playoffs. In the 2014–15 season, they won a then-franchise record 49 games, but failed for a second consecutive year to advance past {{the first round of the}} playoffs, getting swept by the Washington Wizards, 4–0. In the 2015–16 season, they won a franchise record 56 games, finishing in second place in the conference for the first time in franchise history. In the playoffs, they won their first playoff series since 2001 by defeating both the Indiana Pacers and Miami Heat, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time against the Cleveland Cavaliers, only for the Raptors to lose to the eventual NBA champions in six games. In the 2016–17 season, the Raptors make the playoffs again, this time defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round, but losing to the defending champions in the second round.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} {{to come to}} grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle <b>in</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.|$|E
5|$|After the World Series championship, Smith and the Cardinals {{agreed on}} a new {{contract}} in January 1983 that paid Smith $1 million per year. Smith was voted <b>in</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> National League's starting shortstop in the All-Star Game {{for the first time}} in 1983, and at season's end won a fourth consecutive Gold Glove Award. During July of the 1984 season, Smith went on the disabled list with a broken wrist after being hit by a pitch during a game against the Padres. Smith's return to the lineup a month later was not enough to propel the Cardinals to a postseason berth.|$|E

5|$|After two losing seasons, the Browns {{made it back}} to {{contention}} in 2007. After {{opening with}} a 34–7 loss to the Steelers, the Browns traded Frye to the Seahawks and put Anderson <b>in</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> starter. In his first start, Anderson led the Browns to a surprise 51–45 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, throwing five touchdown passes and tying the franchise record. More success followed, and the Browns finished the regular season with a 10–6 record, the team's best mark since finishing 11–5 in 1994. While the Browns tied with the Steelers for first place in the AFC North, the team missed the playoffs because of two tie-breaking losses to Pittsburgh earlier in the season. Still, six players were selected for the Pro Bowl, including Anderson, Winslow, Edwards, kick returner Josh Cribbs and rookie left tackle Joe Thomas. Crennel agreed to a two-year contract extension until 2011, and the team hired Mike Keenan as team president, filling a position left vacant upon the departure of Collins two years before.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} Christmas Bowl, Hiruma is {{selected}} by the Ojo White Knights' Seijuro Shin {{to be one of}} Team Japan's two quarterbacks for the International Youth American Football tournament due to his knack for trick plays. Hiruma quickly settles <b>in</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> main strategist on the team. Even before this, Hiruma spies on Team USA to acquire information on the ace American players, who are considered by far the favorites to win the tournament. In typical fashion, Hiruma refuses to permit players on the team out of sympathy rather than merit, including his Devil Bats teammates, but does agree with the decision to hold a final tryout as a method of enlisting bench players. Two years later, Hiruma, now in college, is part of the college's American football team, Saikyouda, opposing some of his former teammates (students at other colleges) as they compete to play in the Rice Bowl—the game between the best college American football teams.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{the only}} other {{scenario}} writer on the project was Yūto Tonokawa of Key, who previously contributed on Key's sixth game Little Busters!. Tanaka was tasked with drawing up the entire scenario framework, and during this time, Takahiro Baba suggested that one more heroine route {{be added to the}} story to bring the total to six, but to do that they had to hire another writer. Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, the creators of the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Umineko no Naku Koro ni game franchises, was brought <b>in</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> third scenario writer after Baba suggested in late 2007 that Key ask him to join the staff for Rewrite. Ultimately, Tanaka wrote the story leading up to the heroine's routes, Kotori's and Akane's scanarios, the Moon and Terra routes, and the bonus Oppai route. Tonokawa wrote Chihaya's and Sizuru's routes, and Ryukishi07 wrote Lucia's story. Tanaka initially planned on the length of Rewrites story to be on about the same scale as Key's second game Air, but as it increased in size, he later attempted to keep it close to the scale of Little Busters!.|$|E

While the majority of the members wanted a female leader after the departure of Myhre, his supporters were perfectly aware that Folkvord could lose the nomination and a campaign was started to make him deputy leader. The main problem for Folkvord's opposition was his close ties to the Workers' Communist Party.
