40|$|The war in South Ossetia in August 2008 {{once again}} fuelled discussions on Russia’s re-emergence as a <b>great</b> <b>power</b> in world {{politics}} – a <b>great</b> <b>power</b> that flexes its military muscle and asserts its influence {{not only in}} the post-Soviet space but also beyond. But what is behind Russian <b>great</b> <b>power</b> thinking? In this contribution, Martin Müller argues that visions of a <b>great</b> <b>power</b> Russia have, in fact, inevitable flaws: they are shot through with intense doubts and misgivings about the very possibility of this strength...|$|R

5|$|On October 27, 1914, after {{approval}} from the <b>Great</b> <b>Powers,</b> the Greek army re-entered the area. During the Greek administration, and while the First World War continued, it had been agreed between Greece, Italy and the <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> that the final settlement of the Northern Epirote issue {{should be left to}} the future, after the war ended. After Venizelos' resignation in December however, the succeeding royalist governments were determined to exploit the situation and pre-determine the region's future by incorporating it formally within the Greek state. In the first months of 1916, Northern Epirus participated in the Greek elections and elected 16 representatives for the Greek Parliament. In March, the region's union with Greece was officially declared, and the area was divided into the prefectures of Argyrokastro and Korytsa.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} his (and his advisors') {{policies}} {{was to make}} the Great Powers' parties more powerful, not less.

5|$|Throughout {{his reign}} Otto {{was unable to}} resolve Greece's poverty and prevent {{economic}} meddling from outside. Greek politics in this era was based on affiliations with the three <b>Great</b> <b>Powers,</b> and Otto's ability to maintain {{the support of the}} powers was key to his remaining in power. To remain strong, Otto had to play the interests of each of the Great Powers' Greek adherents against the others, while not aggravating the <b>Great</b> <b>Powers.</b> When Greece was blockaded by the British Royal Navy in 1850 and again in 1854, to stop Greece from attacking the Ottoman Empire during the Crimean War, Otto's standing amongst Greeks suffered. As a result, there was an assassination attempt on the Queen, and finally in 1862 Otto was deposed while in the countryside. He died in exile in Bavaria in 1867.|$|E
5|$|As a {{response}} to the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, Venizelos's power base was further strengthened, and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favor of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government under Georgios Theotokis and the objections of the <b>Great</b> <b>Powers.</b> The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, President Herbert Hoover {{appointed}} Stanley to the International Joint Commission, a body {{charged with}} settling boundary disputes between the United States and Canada. Stanley became its chair in 1933.

He served until 1954 when he resigned under pressure from his own party.|$|E

25|$|Other {{suggestions}} {{have been}} made that a <b>great</b> <b>power</b> should {{have the capacity to}} engage in extra-regional affairs and that a <b>great</b> <b>power</b> ought to be possessed of extra-regional interests, two propositions which are often closely connected.|$|R
50|$|Multilateralism, {{whether in}} the form of {{membership}} in an in international institutions,to bind the <b>great</b> <b>power,</b> discourage unilateralism, and give the small powers a voice and voting opportunities that they would not otherwise have. Especially, if control is sought by a small <b>power</b> over a <b>great</b> <b>power,</b> then the Lilliputian strategy of small countries achieving control by collectively binding the <b>great</b> <b>power</b> is likely to be most effective. Similarly, if control is sought by a <b>great</b> <b>power</b> over another <b>great</b> <b>power,</b> then multilateral controls may be most useful. The <b>great</b> <b>power</b> could seek control through bilateral ties, but this would be costly; it also would require bargaining and compromise with the other <b>great</b> <b>power.</b> Embedding the target state in a multilateral alliance reduces the costs borne by the power seeking control, but it also offers the same binding benefits of the Lilliputian strategy. Furthermore, if a small power seeks control over another small power, multilateralism may be the only choice, because small powers rarely have the resources to exert control on their own. As such, power disparities are accommodated to the weaker states by having more predictable bigger states and means to achieve control through collective action. Powerful states also buy into multilateral agreements by writing the rules and having privileges such as veto power and special status.|$|R
5|$|It is {{generally}} accepted by historians that, although Otto failed, he deeply loved Greece {{as his own}} new homeland. His failure was mainly {{a result of the}} continuous intrigues and competition among the three <b>Great</b> <b>Powers.</b> Before his death, Otto asked to be buried in his own Greek traditional uniform.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, after {{continued}} {{unrest in}} Crete, {{which included the}} murder of the British vice-consul, Prince George of Greece was made the Governor-General of Crete under the suzerainty of the Sultan, after the proposal was put forward by the <b>Great</b> <b>Powers.</b> Greece was effectively in day-to-day control of Crete {{for the first time in}} modern history.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Greek army {{evacuated}} from the region, and, on 1 March, Korytsa (Korçë) was ceded {{to the newly}} formed Albanian gendarmerie.

Meanwhile, an International Commission formed by the <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> to secure stability and peace in the region was unable to achieve an agreement between the two sides.|$|E

But the <b>Great</b> <b>power</b> system institutionalizes the position of the powerful state in a web of rights and obligations." ...|$|R
5|$|On June 1 the <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> (including Italy and Austria-Hungary) {{approved}} {{the results of}} the negotiations and on June 23 the terms of the Protocol were officially approved by the Albanian Government. The Greek government, without being involved until then in the situation, was aware of the negotiations and the possibility of a final agreement. Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos advised Georgios Christakis-Zografos to approve the protocol’s terms without asking for even wider autonomy.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes also {{concentrated}} on the Rhodes Scholarship, which had British statesman Alfred Milner {{as one of its}} trustees.

5|$|Several Bulgarian revolts erupted {{throughout}} the nearly five centuries of Ottoman rule, {{most notably the}} Habsburg-backed Tarnovo uprisings in 1598 and in 1686, the Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688 and Karposh's Rebellion in 1689. In the 18th century, the Enlightenment in Western Europe provided influence for the initiation of a movement known as the National awakening of Bulgaria. It restored national consciousness and became {{a key factor in}} the liberation struggle, resulting in the 1876 April Uprising. Up to 30,000 Bulgarians were killed as Ottoman authorities put down the rebellion. The massacres prompted the <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> to take action. They convened the Constantinople Conference in 1876, but their decisions were rejected by the Ottomans. This allowed the Russian Empire to seek a solution by force without risking military confrontation with other <b>Great</b> <b>Powers,</b> as had happened in the Crimean War. In 1877 Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire and defeated its forces with the help of Bulgarian volunteers.|$|E

5|$|The Great Idea (Μεγάλη Ιδέα), {{the dream}} of uniting all Greek populations of the Ottoman Empire, thereby {{restoring}} the Byzantine Empire under Christian rule, led him to contemplate entering the Crimean War {{on the side of}} Russia against Turkey and its British and French allies in 1853; the enterprise was unsuccessful, and resulted in renewed intervention by the two <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> and a second blockade of Piraeus port, forcing Greece to neutrality.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{government}} {{was reluctant to}} overtly support the uprising. Military and political officials continued {{to carry out a}} slow evacuation process, which had begun in March and ended on 28 April. Resistance was officially discouraged, and assurances were given that the <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> and the International Control Commission (an organization founded by the <b>Great</b> <b>Powers</b> in order to secure peace and stability in the area) would guarantee their rights. Following the declaration in Gjirokastër, Zografos sent messages to local representatives in Korçë (gr. Korytsá) asking them to join the movement; however, the Greek military commander of the city, Colonel Alexandros Kontoulis, followed his official orders strictly and declared martial law, threatening to shoot any citizen raising the Northern Epirote flag. When the local bishop of Kolonjë (gr. Kolónia), Spyridon, proclaimed the Autonomy, Kontoulis had him immediately arrested and expelled.|$|E
