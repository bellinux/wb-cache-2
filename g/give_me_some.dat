500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about getting [...] "the rules {{straight}} on a budding relationship: Slow down and don't say you love me until you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> time {{and get to know}} me." [...] According to musicologist Jon Mikkel Broch Ålvik, [...] "Don't Say You Love Me" [...] is the [...] "thinking person's teen pop." [...] Ålvik rejects a superficial interpretation that the lyrics are a [...] "moralistic message of abstinence", arguing instead that M2M [...] "signal a stance that sounds considered and assured rather than prudish" [...] and that {{the song is}} a statement of [...] "burgeoning agency." [...] The song has been described as bubblegum pop music with similar lyrical qualities to songs by girl groups of the 1960s, while also having more influence from rock and singer-songwriter genres than was typical for other teen pop songs of the late 1990s.|$|E
500|$|The art {{director}} for In Utero was Robert Fisher, who had designed all of Nirvana's releases on DGC. [...] Most {{of the ideas}} for the artwork for the album and related singles came from Cobain. [...] Fisher recalled that [...] " [...] would just <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> loose odds and ends and say 'Do something with it.'" [...] The cover of the album is {{an image of a}} Transparent Anatomical Manikin, with angel wings superimposed. [...] Cobain created the collage on the back cover, which he described as [...] "Sex and woman and In Utero and vaginas and birth and death", that consists of model fetuses, a turtle shell and models of turtles, and body parts lying in a bed of orchids and lilies. [...] The collage had been set up on the floor of Cobain's living room and was photographed by Charles Peterson after an unexpected call from Cobain. [...] The album's track listing and re-illustrated symbols from Barbara G. Walker's The Woman's Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects were then positioned {{around the edge of the}} collage.|$|E
500|$|... "Road to Rhode Island" [...] was {{directed}} by Dan Povenmire and was written by Gary Janetti. It featured guest appearances from Victoria Principal as Dr. Amanda Rebecca, Danny Smith and Wally Wingert as various characters. This was the first episode directed by Povenmire. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane granted Povenmire substantial creative freedom for directing episodes. Povenmire said that MacFarlane would tell him, [...] "We've got two minutes to fill. <b>Give</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> visual gags. Do whatever you want. I trust you." [...] Povenmire praised MacFarlane's management style for letting him have fun. Several years after the episode was written, in DVD commentary for the eighth and ninth season of the show, Gary Janetti, the writer of the episode, recalled that the original title of the episode {{was intended to be}} simply [...] "Brian & Stewie", but was changed by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, who wanted there to be a [...] "Road to" [...] episode each season. The name of the episode was then changed to [...] "Road to Rhode Island", with the original name later being used for the landmark 150th episode of the show, also entitled [...] "Brian & Stewie", and written by Janetti.|$|E

500|$|In early 2007, it was {{reported}} that Madonna was recording songs with American singer Justin Timberlake for her upcoming eighth studio album. Later, it was also announced that record producers Timbaland and Pharrell Williams were working with her on the album, and Timbaland confirmed that a song titled [...] "Candy Shop" [...] was being produced by Williams. On July 2007, a demo of the song, titled [...] "Candy Store", leaked online, but was quickly removed following copyright issues. [...] "Candy Shop" [...] was the first song Madonna and Williams worked on together. The latter recalled, [...] "we were just in a studio, [...] and [...] was like, 'Look, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> hot shit.' I was looking at her like, 'She's saying hot shit?' She was like, 'What?' And I'm like, 'OK.' So we just worked and made it." [...] Madonna stated during an interview with Q magazine that [...] "Candy Shop", along with album track [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You", was among her favorite songs, [...] "I love 'Candy Shop' cos it's cheeky and fun, and I feel it sort of represents the sassy side of me; the fun, sassy side of me. And I just love the way it sounds. And I love candy!".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Disney {{began to}} {{negotiate}} with Joseph Kosinski to direct Tron: Legacy. Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are you interested? What would your take be? In a post-Matrix world, how do {{you go back to the}} world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like. <b>Give</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> money and let me do a small test that will give you a hint for a couple minutes of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E
500|$|With Interview magazine, Madonna {{explained}} her inspirations {{behind the}} songs and the music of Hard Candy. She said that [...] "probably in many respects most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an unconscious way. I don't really think about telling personal stories when I'm writing music. It just comes. And {{then a lot of}} times, six months later, eight months later, I go, 'Oh, that's what I wrote that song about.' But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that.'" [...] "Candy Shop" [...] is the opening track of the album. Produced by Williams, the song uses the word candy as a metaphor for sex. Williams said, [...] "We were just in a studio, [...] and [...] was like, 'Look, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> hot shit.' I was looking at her like, 'She's saying hot shit?' She was like, 'What?' And I'm like, 'OK.' So we just worked and made it." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "4 Minutes", was initially known as [...] "4 Minutes to Save the World". The song's development was motivated by a sense of urgency to save the planet from destruction, and how people can enjoy themselves in the process. According to Madonna, the song inspired her to produce the documentary I Am Because We Are. The song features vocals by Timberlake and Timbaland. An uptempo dance song with an urban, hip hop style, it also incorporates Timbaland's bhangra beats. The instrumentation used in the song includes brass, foghorns and cow bells. The song's lyrics carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed.|$|E

2500|$|A {{story is}} {{preserved}} that {{once when he}} was a child, his father took him to the Kaaba, and asked him to pray before the idols. His father went away to attend to some other business, and Abu Bakr was left alone with the idols. Addressing an idol, Abu Bakr said [...] "O my God, I am in need of beautiful clothes; bestow them on me". The idol remained indifferent. Then he addressed another idol saying [...] "O God, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> delicious food. See that I am so hungry". The idol remained cold. That exhausted the patience of young Abu Bakr. He lifted a stone, and addressing an idol said [...] "Here I am aiming a stone; if you are a god protect yourself". Abu Bakr hurled the stone at the idol and left the Kaaba. Thereafter, he never went to the Kaaba to pray to the idols.|$|E
2500|$|After the albums release, several {{publications}} {{deemed the}} {{commercial value of}} the album as a flop. In retrospect, Minogue commented; [...] "Maybe it didn’t do as well because it wasn’t good enough or it didn’t deserve more, who knows?". She further exclaimed, [...] "Even in retrospect it’s hard to say why something works or it doesn’t. It’s dependent on what else is out there, the way it’s promoted... The tour {{has been the most}} successful part of that album campaign for me. The album did <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> freedom." [...] In June 2015, publications reported Minogue's departure from Parlophone due to the performance of Kiss Me Once, which she first denied. However, she later confirmed she had parted with the label in December 2015 and would stay permanently with Warner Music Australia; she did announced her album Kylie Christmas that same month, and would be her final overall release with Parlophone.|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} {{precursor to}} deism {{was the work}} of Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury (d. 1648). He has been called the [...] "father of English deism", and his book De Veritate (On Truth, as It Is Distinguished from Revelation, the Probable, the Possible, and the False) (1624) [...] "the first major statement of deism". However, his beliefs in divine intervention, particularly in response to prayer, are at odds with the basic ideas of deism. In Herbert's account of one incident, he prayed [...] "I am not satisfied enough whether I shall publish this Book, De Veritate; if it be for Thy glory, I beseech Thee <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> Sign from Heaven, if not, I shall suppress it" [...] and recounts that the response was [...] "a loud tho' yet gentle Noise came from the Heavens (for it was like nothing on Earth)...

2500|$|In contrast, law {{enforcement}} officials such as Spencer Lawton, the former Chatham County prosecutor who put Davis on trial, remained convinced of the evidence for Davis's guilt and that Davis's supporters [...] "would know differently if {{they looked at the}} record." [...] He stated: [...] "We have consistently won the case as it has been presented in court. We have consistently lost the case as it has been presented in the public realm, on TV and elsewhere." [...] Members of MacPhail's family were also convinced of Davis's guilt, and thought his execution would bring a measure of peace.

Every time I teach him anything, I find that he knows it far better than I do!"

While Jesus played with the youths of his village, he used {{to tell them what}} their parents were doing." [...] Sa'id ibn Jubayr, according to Tabari, is said to have reported that Jesus would say to one of his fellow playmates in the religious school, [...] "Your parents have kept such and such food for you, would you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> of it?" [...] Jesus would usually tell his fellow pupils in the religious school what their parents ate and what they have kept for them when they return home.

2500|$|Chosen by Empress Dowager Cixi on her deathbed, Puyi became emperor {{at the age}} of 2years and 10months in December1908 {{after the}} Guangxu Emperor died on 14November. Titled the Xuantong Emperor (Wade-Giles: Hsuan-tung Emperor), Puyi's {{introduction}} to the life of an emperor began when palace officials arrived at his family residence to take him. On the evening of 13November 1908, without any advance notice, a procession of eunuchs and guardsmen led by the palace chamberlain left the Forbidden City for the Northern Mansion to inform Prince Chun that they were taking away his three-year-old son Puyi to be the new emperor. The toddler Puyi screamed and resisted as the officials ordered the eunuch attendants to pick him up. Puyi's parents said nothing when they learned that they were losing their son. As Puyi cried, screaming {{that he did not want}} to leave his parents, he was forced into a palanquin that took him back to the Forbidden City. Puyi's wet nurse Wang Wen-Chao was the only person from the Northern Mansion allowed to go with him, and she calmed the very distraught Puyi down by allowing him to suckle one of her breasts; this was the only reason why she was taken along as only she could calm Puyi down. Upon arriving at the Forbidden City, Puyi was taken to see the Dowager Empress Cixi. Puyi later wrote: I still have a dim recollection of this meeting, the shock of which left a deep impression on my memory. I remember suddenly finding myself surrounded by strangers, while before me was hung a drab curtain through which I could see an emaciated and terrifying hideous face. This was Cixi. It is said that I burst out into loud howls at the sight and started to tremble uncontrollably. Cixi told someone to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> sweets, but I threw them on the floor and yelled [...] "I want nanny, I want nanny", to her great displeasure. [...] "What a naughty child" [...] she said. [...] "Take him away to play." [...] His father, Prince Chun, became Prince Regent (摄政王). During Puyi's coronation in the Hall of Supreme Harmony on 2December 1908, the young emperor was carried onto the Dragon Throne by his father. Puyi was so frightened by the scene before him and the deafening sounds of ceremonial drums and music that he started crying. His father could do nothing except to quietly comfort him: [...] "Don't cry, it'll be over soon." ...|$|E
