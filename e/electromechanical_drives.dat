5000|$|The second {{member of}} the Bars radar family is the N011M, a radar that uses an {{electronically}} scanned (phased array) slotted planar antenna but with the experience gained from {{the development of the}} N007 Zaslon. In an effort to improve performance the antenna design was changed to a multi-channel passive electronically scanned array (PESA). The design of the N011M Bars antenna like the earlier N007 antenna consists of two separate electronically controlled arrays, an X band radar and an L band IFF transponder with a total weight of 100 kg and a diameter of 960 mm. The radar has a peak power output of 4-5 kW [...] and is capable of positioning beams in 400 microseconds, a huge advantage over mechanically scanned radar. The Bars radar can be fixed in position to give a scanning sector of ±70 degrees in azimuth and ±45 degrees in elevation. [...] To improve scan coverage, the radar can also be mounted on <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives,</b> and in this case, the scanning sector is expanded to ±90 degrees.|$|E
40|$|Pneumatic linear drives {{are widely}} used in manufacturing, mainly for {{handling}} tasks. Due to rising interest in environmental matters and increasing energy costs, energy efficiency {{has become a major}} issue in industrial applications. There is a growing competition between pneumatic and <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives.</b> Pneumatic drives are said to have a lower efficiency while the initial costs of <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives</b> are higher. The operating costs of electromechanical as well as pneumatic drives are induced by their exergy efficiency. The efficiency of the drives depends on parameters like cycle time, load applied to the cylinder and its acceleration and velocity. Former research did only provide limited data on the influence of these parameters. The paper provides an overview on the exergy efficiency of pneumatic and <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives</b> and its dependency on the mentioned parameters. Since <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives</b> are often used to replace pneumatic drives both technologies are examined in typical applications for pneumatic drives, including horizontal and vertical movement and sustaining a load for different periods in vertical usage...|$|E

40|$|The {{very high}} {{specific}} work load of thermal shape memory alloys qualifies {{the material to}} be a suitable alternative of conventional drives. Especially the automotive industry is highly interested in drive concepts for substituting <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives.</b> In modern cars more than fifty drives are applied for several tasks like adjusting headlights, mirrors, flaps or to open/close doors, petrol caps and so on. Due to {{the increasing number of}} such mechatronic components the automotive manufacturer are getting serious problems with the increasing weight, the increasing costs and to provide the needed cross sections for these components. A suitable option to overcome this problem is using the shape memory technology to realise significantly smaller, lighter and cheaper drives. While it is never easy to establish a new technology at a market, the special demands of the automotive industry make it even more complicated. However, the benefit of the technology compared to <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives</b> seems to be enormous.

Starting at the design of actuators made of the semi-finished material, the specific advantages and disadvantages of the technology are figured out. The potential of shape memory actuators are illustrated on several exemplarily applications. The actual as well as the estimated developments in the future will be discussed further...|$|E

However, for controlled systems, new features are needed to distinguish between information generated by the system and input control.

A learning algorithm is proposed for on-line generation of the grammar productions, this formulation being then used for modelling, control and anomaly detection. Practical applications are described for <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives.</b> Grammatical interpolation techniques yield accurate results and the pattern detection capabilities of the language-based formulation makes it a promising technique for the early detection of anomalies or faulty behaviour.

40|$|Improved drive {{dynamics}} decisively boost {{productivity and}} accuracy of machine tools. Linearmotors have advantages to overcome drawbacks of <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drives,</b> but are limited by their power density.

40|$|In <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drive</b> units, {{the highly}} loaded sliding and rolling {{contacts}} are the failure-prone components in a drive train's mechanical part. Therefore this work introduces an early fault diagnosis to predict imminent failures or breakdowns. After a breakdown has occurred, {{conclusions can be}} drawn from previous history about the cause of failure and the defective subassembly or the failed machine part. It draws on a model-based approach, using so-called minimal models to determine individual characteristics that classify the faults. The minimal models are built on physical foundations and provide, for certain operating states, individual characteristics of time and temperature behavior, which, by themselves or in combination, allow to draw conclusions about changes in tribological systems of <b>electromechanical</b> <b>drive</b> units. Tests have confirmed the practicability of the model-based approaches. Not the absolute values of the characteristics are used for early fault diagnosis, but their change over time. The resulting trends enable reliable forecasts. As soon as changes to the characteristics have been identified as failure-relevant, they become symptoms that can be interpreted according to a set of rules. This allows for predictions regarding the expected fault, its time of occurrence, and the root cause. The evaluation is comprehensible to the user, since the use of minimal models matches the maintenance engineer's way of thinking. This enables the maintenance engineer to understand and check the plausibility of the conclusions drawn by the rule interpreter. The user is encouraged to add to the rule base from his own experience...|$|R
