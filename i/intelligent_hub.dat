40|$|This paper {{presents}} a protocol for packet switched optical LANs using a star topology. The {{key element in}} this network {{is the use of}} an <b>intelligent</b> <b>hub,</b> which controls the traffic flow and which provides controls for adding and removing new stations from the network. The <b>intelligent</b> <b>hub</b> allows this network design to be scalable, easy to administer and manage, and reduces the complexity and costs of the network interface devices that will be needed at each station. The network makes use of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) as well as time division multiplexing (TDM) to fully exploit the fiber’s bandwidth. Each station will have a tunable transmitter and a slow speed tunable receiver for data traffic and a fixed receiver and fixed transmitter for use on the control channel. 1...|$|E
40|$|In the {{competitive}} electricity structure, demand response programs enable customers to react dynamically {{to changes in}} electricity prices. The implementation of such programs may reduce energy costs and increase reliability. To fully harness such benefits, existing load controllers and appliances need around-theclock price information. Advances {{in the development and}} deployment of Advanced Meter Infrastructures (AMIs), Building Automation Systems (BASs), and various dedicated embedded control systems provide the capability to effectively address this requirement. In this paper we introduce a Meter Gateway Architecture (MGA) to serve as a foundation for integrated control of loads by energy aggregators, facility hubs, and intelligent appliances. We discuss the requirements that motivate the architecture, describe its design, and illustrate its application to a small system with an intelligent appliance and a legacy appliance using a prototype implementation of an <b>intelligent</b> <b>hub</b> for the MGA and ZigBee wireless communications...|$|E

50|$|While both {{technologies}} provide similar end results, there are fundamental differences between USB and FireWire. USB requires {{the presence of}} a bus master, typically a PC, which connects point to point with the USB slave. This allows for simpler (and lower-cost) peripherals, at the cost of lowered functionality of the bus. <b>Intelligent</b> <b>hubs</b> are required to connect multiple USB devices to a single USB bus master. By contrast, FireWire is essentially a peer-to-peer network (where any device may serve as the host or client), allowing multiple devices to be connected on one bus.|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, the {{development}} of complex surveillance systems has captured the interest of both the research and industrial worlds. Strong and challenging requirements of modern society {{are involved in this}} problem, which aims to increase safety and security in several application domains such as transport, tourism, home and bank security, military applications, etc. At the same time, fast improvements in microelectronics, telecommunications, and computer science make it necessary to consider new perspectives in this field. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate, discuss, and evaluate the impact of distributed processing and new communication techniques on multimedia surveillance systems, which represent the so-called third-generation surveillance systems (3 GSSs). In particular aspects related to the distribution of intelligence among multiple-processing and wide-bandwidth resources are discussed in detail. It is shown how distribution of intelligence can be obtained by a hierarchical architecture that partitions, in a dynamic way, the main logical processing tasks (i. e., representation, recognition, and communication) performed in a 3 GSS physical architecture made lip of <b>intelligent</b> cameras, <b>hubs,</b> and central control rooms. The advantages of this solution are pointed out in terms of: 1) increased flexibility and reconfigurability and 2) optimal allocation of available processing and bandwidth resources. Finally, a case study is analyzed that allows one to gain a deeper insight into a distributed surveillance system...|$|R
40|$|Congestion is a {{major problem}} in most {{metropolitan}} areas and given the increasing rate of urbanization {{it is likely to be}} an even more serious problem in the rapidly expanding mega cities. Some well know negative effects of congestion include: 1) the economic losses and quality of life degradation that result from the increased and unpredictable travel times, 2) the increased level of carbon footprint that vehicles idling in congestions leave behind, and 3) the increased number of traffic accidents that are direct results of the stress and fatigue of drivers that are stuck in congestion. One possible method to combat congestion is provide intelligent traffic management systems that can in a timely manner inform drivers about current or predicted traffic congestion that is relevant to them on their journeys. This this extent, the present paper proposes a scalable, grid-based <b>intelligent</b> traffic information <b>hub</b> that facilitates the manual definition and/or automatic detection of abnormal traffic condition events, e. g., accidents or congestion, and in advance informs drivers about events that will likely be relevant to them on their journey, thereby allowing the divers or their onboard navigation units to alter their paths as needed. The proposed system achieves the above described functionality through the following methodology. The system, without loss of generality, adopts a grid-based discretization of space, which by changing the resolution of the grid allows the system to scale in terms of it computation cost and the geographical level of detail of traffic information that it manages. The system derives traffic information from the continuous stream of grid-based position and speed reports that it receives from the vehicles. In particular, the system in an online fashion 1) summarizes Current (grid-based) Traffic Flow Statistics (CTFS), i. e., it records for each grid cell g from each neighboring grid cell n, the mean and standard deviation of the speeds of the vehicles that are currently located in g and have entered g from n; and 2) efficiently incorporates the CTFS into compressed Historical (grid-based) Traffic Flow Statistics (HTFS) using incremental statistics. Simultaneously, using a sliding window model, the system also 1) maintains the Recent (grid-based) Trajectories (RT) of the vehicles; 2) extracts Recent (gridbased) Mobility Statistics (RMS), i. e., it records for each destination grid cell d, for each neighboring grid cell n of g, and for each possible source grid cell s, the number of vehicles that (i) are currently in d, (ii) have entered d from n, and (iii) have a RT that has passed through s; and 3) efficiently incorporates the RMS into compressed Historical (grid-based) Mobility Statistics (HMS) using incremental statistics. To capture the temporal variability in traffic flow and mobility patterns at different scales, the system through temporal domain projections maintains day-of-week and hour-ofday based aggregations of HTFS and RMS. Then, the system classifies a grid cell g to be congested from the direction of a neighboring grid cell n if the current mean speed of vehicles that entered the grid cell g from the direction of n is below the normal according to the temporally relevant HFS. Finally, based on the temporally relevant HMS, the system sends out congestion notifications to vehicles that are likely to be effected in the future part of their journey by these congestions, i. e., the system sends out a congestion notification (g,n) to a vehicle v that is currently located in some grid cell s from which the likelihood of v moving to g through n within the prediction horizon is above a user-defined threshold. Extensive empirical evaluations on large sets of realistically simulated trajectories of vehicles illustrate that the above described methodology and its simple SQL-based implementation in a relational database system is scalable and effective. In particular, the execution time of- and the space used by the system scales linearly with the input size (number of concurrently moving vehicles) and the method’s mutually dependent parameters (grid resolution r and RT length l) that jointly define a spatio-temporal resolution. Within the area of a large city (40 km by 40 km), assuming a 60 km/h average vehicle speed, the system, running on a single personal computer, can manage the described congestion detection and one-minute-ahead notification tasks within real-time requirements for 15 thousand and 2. 5 million concurrently moving vehicles for spatio-temporal resolutions (r= 62. 5 m, l= 17) and (r= 4 km,l= 2), respectively. Finally, the proposed method, for all spatio-temporal resolutions and prediction horizons, significantly outperforms in terms of notification accuracy the grid-based baseline method, which sends non-directional congestion notifications based on the recent linear movement tendencies of vehicles.   Title and abstract has been slightly revised and published online ([URL] and are different from the original information in the online proceedings ([URL]   QC 20150522 </p...|$|R
