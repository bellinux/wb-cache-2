40|$|As the Department of Defense Ada mandate {{begins to}} be {{enforced}} actively, interest in deploying expert systems in Ada has increased. A prototype Ada based expert system tool is introduced called ART/Ada. This prototype was built to support research into the language and operational <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> in Ada. ART/Ada allows applications of a conventional expert system tool called ART-IM (Automated Reasoning Tool for Information Management) to be deployed in various Ada environments with efficient use of time and space. ART-IM, a C-based expert system tool, is used to generate Ada source code which is compiled and linked with an Ada base inference engine to produce an Ada executable image. ART/Ada {{will be used to}} implement several prototype expert systems for the Space Station Freedom Program testbeds...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} the use <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> and artificial intelligence, (in particular {{the application of}} neural networks) to real estate forecasting. While {{there is a great}} deal of literature about the use of artificial intelligence for mass appraisal, there is relatively little work on how it can be applied in real estate forecasting. This paper {{examines the}} current uses of artificial intelligence, particularly neural networks, in the business-forecasting field and considers suitable applications in real estate. The paper also considers the broader <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> and how a better system can lead to better results. Some real estate data are used as simple case studies to demonstrate their use. Over the last few decades there have been significant changes to the methods of forecasting available to analysts and practitioners. Complex methods have become available for routine use and complex econometric models are often suggested as the solution to forecasting problems. However some researchers suggest that the use o...|$|R
40|$|A central <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> is the manmachine -interface. One of {{its most}} {{ergonomic}} realizations is a natural language interface. Uncertainty and indeterminateness are main properties of natural language. While there are many formalisms dealing with uncertainty, there still is a strong need of those modeling indeterminateness. Therefore a formalism is presented which (a) formalizes the semantic interpretation of natural language and (b) provides an instrument for reasoning with information given in natural language. After a short outline of the problem the theoretical foundations are discussed, showing {{that it can be}} solved by a statistical formalism based on a trivalent logic. Finally the formalism is exemplified and compared to related theories. 1.

40|$|The usage <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> in law {{brings many}} {{problematic}} questions. Complexity and intricacy of law, combined with limited possibilities of information technologies {{makes it difficult}} to create flawlessly working <b>expert</b> <b>systems.</b> In this article the author analyses problematic aspects related to <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> usage in law. Comparisons of various research are made according to analysis of scientific articles. The author analyses practical difficulties of legal norm representation, creation <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> knowledge ontology, <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> liability <b>issues.</b> Legal responsibility <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> developers, users, and owners are also covered in this paper. Creation of legal ontologies is a complicated process {{because of the nature of}} the subject itself and the complexity and quantity of knowledge which must be represented in order to have fully functional legal <b>expert</b> <b>system.</b> Legal information basically consists of legal norms, doctrine, precedents and <b>expert</b> knowledge. All <b>of</b> these areas have specific representation issues, but the most difficult part is to make ontology and representation <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> knowledge. Different experts may have distinct points of view in some similar cases. Human decisions are made not only by applying certain rules to the problem decision pattern. Providence, analytical skills and critical thinking is required in legal professional work. Human reasoning and decision-making is not only based on symbolic values, it also consists of intermediate symbolic assumptions. So the question is: is it possible to give a clear structure to something which has no permanent state? The other problem which is analyzed in this article is artificial reasoning methods, which are basically different forms of pattern recognition with some specific methods applied to them. The second part of the paper analyses the liability <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems.</b> Nowadays <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> can’t be legally responsible for their decisions. They lack intellectual potential in order to gain rights and obligations. They are not a legal subject, so they cannot be responsible for their actions. However, the evolution of intellectualized systems is rather slow but steady (compared to other computer sciences). So there is a possibility that <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> may have the ability to gain their rights and obligations in the future. There is some doubt as to whether intellectualized systems will be able to gain status similar to a human legal subject. Therefore some quasi-subject status may be applied to these systems in the future. Legal <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> are applied nowadays in legal practice, and they do make mistakes. Who is responsible for these mistakes and who should be held liable for the negative consequences? It’s a hard question to answer, because of many factors which may cause the poor performance of the system. While there is no direct legal responsibility for <b>expert</b> <b>systems,</b> but damage done by their decisions may be real, the situation when there is no responsibility, subjects may occur. Some researchers claim that <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> help improve the juridical quality of legal process, but the risk of mistake is always there, so intellectualized systems must be used only as advisers, but not as a justice implementation instruments...|$|R

40|$|The Alvey Report has {{resulted}} in a growing interest in the UK in 'expert systems'. It is fairly generally accepted, at least in the UK, that such systems function in a particular type of way, i. e. they arrive at decisions through a process of rule based inference. It is suggested that it may be more fruitful to regard rule based inference as one approach to the construction <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems,</b> and that proven techniques of operational research may well be more useful in constructing other types <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>system.</b> Alternative applications <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> <b>systems</b> are derived {{on the basis of a}} broader definition <b>of</b> an <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> in terms <b>of</b> what it does rather than how it does it.

The use of this knowledge allows the <b>Expert</b> <b>System</b> to arrive at particular conclusions and solutions to a problem, similar to the conclusions that human experts arrive at. The novelty of this technology results in defining a need for an explanatory overview <b>of</b> <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> and guidelines to building <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> especially for managers interested in incorporating <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> development and use in the company's framework of operation.
