40|$|The use {{of color}} <b>electrophotographic</b> (EP) laser <b>printing</b> systems is growing because of their declining cost. Thus, the print quality of color EP laser {{printers}} has become increasingly important. Since toner scatter in color EP laser printers can significantly impact print quality, coring, defined as a process whereby the colorant level is reduced {{in the interior of}} text or characters, is introduced to preserve edge sharpness by reducing toner scatter. The desired amount of reduction for coring depends on line width and overall nominal colorant level. Contrary to physical assessment, cares must be taken to conduct psychophysical assessment due to the possibility of greater uncertainty and complex process. But yet, it should be noticed that the perceived data from a human viewer cannot be replaced with the physical measured data, in terms of acceptability to the end-user of imaging products. Therefore, the measured data by physical assessment should be correlated with the perceived data by psychophysical assessment. ^ In the first chapter, we describe psychophysical studies to directly establish optimal coring values as a function of line width and nominal colorant level. For each line width and nominal colorant level, this is done by asking human subjects to choose the minimum amount of coring that is necessary to eliminate the perception of toner scatter. We conduct four separate psychophysical studies to address different aspects of this question. ^ In the second chapter, we exploit the previously published psychophysical data based on perceived toner scatter. For physical data, we apply the Edge Transition Width (ETW) between T 90 (2 ̆ 6 thetas;) and T 10 (2 ̆ 6 thetas;) boundaries as a line metric to measure sharpness and the Weighted Differential Toner Spread (WDTS) within the region between T¯ 60 and T¯ 05 boundaries to measure the spread of toner scatter.

40|$|A common print quality {{problem in}} <b>electrophotographic</b> (EP) <b>printing</b> is ghosting. Ghosting {{refers to a}} vestigial image {{repeated}} at regular intervals {{down the length of}} a page and appearing as light or dark areas (negative or positive ghosting, respectively) relative to the surrounding field. There are many sources of ghosting, including most EP printer subsystems and many of their components. Subsystems from charging, development, photoreceptor, to fusing can all produce ghosting. The ghosts can be both positive and negative (darker and lighter). Having multiple ghosting sources can make the sources of ghosting difficult to determine, pointing to the need for reliable diagnostic tools. This paper demonstrates how a commercially-available image analysis system is used to quantify ghosting and diagnose its causes. The system utilizes test targets specifically designed to reveal ghosting problems and are optimized for automated inspection. The analysis method uses frequency domain techniques that make it possible to isolate ghosting from other print quality problems.

40|$|The print {{substrate}} {{influences the}} print result in dry toner electrophotography, {{which is a}} widely used digital printing method. The influence of the substrate can be seen more easily in color printing, as that is a more complex process compared to monochrome printing. However, the print quality is also affected by the print substrate in grayscale printing. It is thus {{in the interests of}} both substrate producers and printing equipment manufacturers to understand the substrate properties that influence the quality of printed images in more detail. In dry toner electrophotography, the image is printed by transferring charged toner particles to the print substrate in the toner transfer nip, utilizing an electric field, in addition to the forces linked to the contact between toner particles and substrate in the nip. The toner transfer and the resulting image quality are thus influenced by the surface texture and the electrical and dielectric properties of the print substrate. In the investigation of the electrical and dielectric properties of the papers and the effects of substrate roughness, in addition to commercial papers, controlled sample sets were made on pilot paper machines and coating machines to exclude uncontrolled variables from the experiments. The electrical and dielectric properties of the papers investigated were electrical resistivity and conductivity, charge acceptance, charge decay, and the dielectric permittivity and losses at different frequencies, including the effect of temperature. The objective was to gain an understanding of how the electrical and dielectric properties are affected by normal variables in papermaking, including basis weight, material density, filler content, ion and moisture contents, and coating. In addition, the dependency of substrate resistivity on the electric field applied was investigated. Local discharging did not inhibit transfer with the paper roughness levels that are normal in <b>electrophotographic</b> color <b>printing.</b> The potential decay of paper revealed that the charge decay cannot be accurately described with a single exponential function, since in charge decay there are overlapping mechanisms of conduction and depolarization of paper. The resistivity of the paper depends on the NaCl content and exponentially on moisture content although it is also strongly dependent on the electric field applied. This dependency is influenced by the thickness, density, and filler contents of the paper. Furthermore, the Poole-Frenkel model {{can be applied to the}} resistivity of uncoated paper. The real part of the dielectric constant ε’ increases with NaCl content and relative humidity, but when these materials cannot polarize freely, the increase cannot be explained by summing the effects of their dielectric constants. Dependencies between the dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor and NaCl content, temperature, and frequency show that in the presence of a sufficient amount of moisture and NaCl, new structures with a relaxation time of the order of 10 - 3 s are formed in paper. The ε’ of coated papers is influenced by the addition of pigments and other coating additives with polarizable groups and due to the increase in density. The charging potential decreases and the electrical conductivity, potential decay rate, and dielectric constant of paper increase with increasing temperature. The dependencies are exponential and the temperature dependencies and their activation energies are altered by the ion content.

The photosensitive coating {{is applied to the}} cylinder in liquid form, before it is solidified. The liquid is applied to the cylinder through a needle applicator that translates along the direction of the cylinder axis. The cylinder rotates during this process in order to cover the entire surface. Therefore, the liquid is applied in a spiral pattern. To help spread liquid over the cylinder surface and improve the thickness uniformity, each liquid stream applied from the needle passes under a flexible blade. This process leads to a coating that presents a spiral pattern on the deposited layer thickness, which can cause defects on the electrophotographic process. The complete understanding of the flow is vital to the optimization of the process. A theoretical model of the thin film flow over the surface of a rotating cylinder is presented here. It is based on the lubrication approximation considering a thin precursor film in front of the apparent contact line.
