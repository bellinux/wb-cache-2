Therefore, {{there is a growing}} research interest in developing fault tolerant technologies for marine applications. This paper investigates the control and operation of an inverter fed PM propulsion motor under a specific power electronic failure case. Compared to the technologies reported in literature, this paper formulates a special control strategy for the motor operation during the situation where only one high side switch and one low side switch in two different phases are operational in a standard three-phase six-switch inverter. The proposed control strategy assumes that the remaining switches are failed in open circuit while the corresponding anti-parallel diodes are functional. The mathematical background of the two quadrant control strategy is formulated. The operation is analyzed in the context of marine propulsion power/speed requirements. Simulations for a 50 kW three-phase fault tolerant motor is presented for the operation with the proposed <b>dual</b> <b>switch</b> control strategy.

40|$|This project {{presents}} a novel battery-less wireless sensor {{that can be}} embedded in the road and used to measure traffic flow rate, speed and approximate vehicle weight. Compared to existing inductive loop based traffic sensors, the new sensor is expected to provide increased reliability, easy installation and low maintenance costs. The sensor uses power only for wireless transmission and has ZERO idle power loss. Hence the sensor {{is expected to be}} extremely energy efficient. Energy to power this sensor is harvested entirely from the short duration vibrations that results when an automobile passes over the sensor. A significant portion of the project focuses on developing low power control algorithms that can harvest energy efficiently from the short duration vibrations that result when a vehicle passes over the sensor. To this effect this report develops and compares three control algorithms “Fixed threshold switching”, “Maximum Voltage switching” and “Switched Inductor” for maximizing this harvested energy. The novel “Switched inductor” algorithm with a <b>dual</b> <b>switch</b> control configuration is shown to be the most effective at maximizing harvested energy. All three of the developed control algorithms can be implemented using simple low power analog circuit components. The developed sensor is evaluated using a number of experimental tests.

40|$|APPLICATION NOTE The {{continuous}} {{growth of}} SWITCHMODE ™ Power Supplies (SMPS) worldwide makes this market {{one of the}} most important for manufacturers of power semiconductors. It is particularly important for manufacturers of devices in the 3 A to 10 A current range since most of these power supplies are designed to deliver power in the range of 50 to 1000 W. Although MOSFETs are often preferred for the new designs, ON Semiconductor has extended the capabilities of bipolar transistor products to meet the needs of the line operated SMPS with a series of economical bipolar transistors. This new series is in full production as the MJW 180 xx series which takes advantage of a planar process developed by ON Semiconductor. This Application Note describes the design and performance a 300 −W forward converter operating at 100 kHz utilizing the MJW 18010 planar bipolar power transistor, and demonstrates the overall performance achievable with these new transistors. LINE-OPERATED CONVERTERS Voltage Requirements The planar process is well established for small signal transistors; however, due to its limited breakdown voltage, it was not used to manufacture the high voltage devices needed to design line-operated SWITCHMODE Power Supplies. For power supplies operating directly from the ac line, it can be seen from the standard equations of either the Flyback [1] or the Forward [2] converter topologies that high voltage devices are required. In single switch configurations, the BVceo of the transistor must be greater than 400 V, in conjunction with a minimum BVces of 800 V for circuits operating from a 220 V line. One can solve this problem by either using a collector-to-emitter clamp or using a <b>dual</b> <b>switch</b> design. The drawback will be higher cost and complexity of the total circuit; therefore, economical high voltage transistors are needed for single switch designs for these applications...|$|E

To adapt energy efficiency of sensor node to channel variations, the optimal packet length at the data link layer is considered. Within this model, the energy efficiency can be effectively improved for switch-and-stay combiner (SSC) receiver with optimal switching threshold. Moreover, to improve energy efficiency, we use error control of Bose-Chaudhuri-Hochquengh (BCH) coding for SSC-BPSK receiver node compared to one of non-diversity NCFSK receiver of sensor node.

We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a state-feedback switching law attaining these goals. Further, the more challenging co-design problem is addressed, namely the joint synthesis of a linear state-feedback controller and a stabilizing switching strategy ensuring a prescribed performance. The results are illustrated by means of a numerical example concerning a networked control system under occasional communication failures...|$|R

40|$|A linear {{prefilter}} {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the required complexity of a maximum likelihood sequence detector Viterbi algorithm (MLSD-VA) by shortening the overall channel and prefilter impulse response in dynamic communication systems. The combination of channel and prefilter should have the effect of producing a desired impulse response (DIR) at the detector. Falconer and Magee (1973) showed that for a finite length DIR there are a limited number of possible DIRs that are optimal. For a DIR of length two symbols, there are only two optimal DIRs, for a length three DIR there exists a range of possibly optimal DIRs. In this paper, we present a novel receiver architecture in which we use two equalisers and two Viterbi detectors. Each equaliser has a different target DIR. A selection device chooses between the output of the two VAs. It is demonstrated that, using the two optimal length two DIRs can be preferable to both switched triple DIR system and adaptive DIR strategies. It is also demonstrated in this paper that there exists a range of environments where adaptive DIR MLSD-VA receivers fail, however the proposed <b>dual</b> <b>switched</b> DIR MLSD-VA is successful in these environments.

A <b>dual</b> <b>switching</b> criticality picture is suggested to describe the correlation of channel gating with particle transport. To establish the relation between microscopic criticality and macroscopic quantities, for example, bulk concentration of solute particles, we simulated the mean residence number of solute particle inside one channel as a function of its bulk concentration, based on a one-dimensional lattice model. We found that this behavior fit well to first-order Langmuir isotherm. Considering a system configuration resembling real experimental setup, we established phenomenological models based on the proposed dual criticality picture, to show how to correlate channel gating with single-file transport in DNA nanocompartment system. These numerical calculations were then used to reproduce our recent experimental results based on equilibrium measurements, and showed good consistence. The modeling showed how microscopic nonequilibrium processes lead to macroscopic equilibrium consequence.

40|$|Photon-mediated {{switching}} of polymer solubility plays {{a crucial}} role in the manufacture of integrated circuits by photolithography. Conventional photoresists typically rely on a single switching mechanism based on either a change in polarity or, molecular weight of the polymer. Here we report a photoresist platform that uses both mechanisms. The molecular weight switch was achieved by using a poly(olefin sulfone) designed to undergo photo-induced chain scission. The polarity switch was achieved using pendant groups functionalized with o-nitrobenzyl esters. These are hydrophobic photosensitive-protecting groups for hydrophilic carboxylic acids. On irradiation, they are cleaved, making the polymer soluble in aqueous base. Importantly, the resists do not contain photoacid generator, so do not suffer from problems associated with acid diffusion that are detrimental to pattern fidelity. The 193 nm photochemistry of polymer thin films was followed using grazing angle attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry, and measurements of solubility in aqueous base. The nanoscale patterning performance of the polymers was also assessed using 193 nm interference lithography and electron-beam lithography.

40|$|Helicases are {{transferred}} to replication origins by helicase loading factors. The Escherichia coli DnaC and eukaryotic Cdc 6 / 18 helicase loaders contain ATP sites and are both {{members of the}} AAA+ family. One might expect that ATP is required for helicase loading; however, this study on DnaC illustrates that ATP is not actually needed for DnaC to load helicase onto single-strand DNA (ssDNA). In fact, {{it seems to be}} a paradox that after transfer of helicase to DNA, DnaC–ATP inhibits helicase action. In addition, ATP is required for DnaC function at an early step in oriC replication in which ATP stimulates ssDNA binding by DnaC, leading to expansion of the ssDNA bubble at the origin. Two cofactors, ssDNA and DnaB, trigger hydrolysis of ATP, converting DnaC to the ADP form that no longer inhibits DnaB. These observations have led to the idea that DnaC is a ‘dual’ switch protein, where both the ATP and the ADP forms are sequentially required for replication.
