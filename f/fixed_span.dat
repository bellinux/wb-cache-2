25|$|Over the years, many plans {{had been}} made for a <b>fixed</b> <b>span</b> across the Hudson River south of Albany to replace {{numerous}} car float and ferry operations. One of the most persistent was originally chartered in 1868 as the Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge Company, whose proposed bridge would have crossed from Anthony's Nose to Fort Clinton, now roughly {{the site of the}} Bear Mountain Bridge. It was never built.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth {{was once}} home to several smaller bascule bridges. The South First Street Bridge over the Elizabeth River, {{originally}} built in 1908, {{was replaced by}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>span.</b> The South Front Street Bridge (also over the Elizabeth River), built in 1922, has been left in the open position since March 2011. A study is underway to determine if the bridge can be rehabilitated. The bridge is notable in that it is the only remaining movable road bridge in Union County (movable railroad bridges still exist).|$|E
25|$|The Washington Post {{reported}} that without immediate action, truck and bus traffic {{over the bridge}} could be banned within five years. However, the park service had yet to budget for any repairs. Borders suggested that if Congress were to immediately fund the bridge's complete overhaul, a two- to four-year reconstruction could begin as early as 2016. Repair options, which ranged from $125 million to $250 million in cost, included replacing the draw span with a <b>fixed</b> <b>span</b> and either closing the bridge completely for 40 to 100 days or keeping it partially open for four years.|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{consisted}} of four <b>fixed</b> <b>spans,</b> one swing span and a fifth swing span, {{and carried a}} double-track railway.|$|R
5000|$|On 23 November 1988, {{one of the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>spans</b> {{was pushed}} out of {{alignment}} by a collision with the Swedish vessel Samo (...) , which became trapped between the bridge's piers.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, the two drawbridges on the {{northern}} approach to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, dating to the original twin Skyway bridges, were replaced with high-level <b>fixed</b> <b>spans,</b> eliminating bottlenecks caused by openings.|$|R
500|$|In {{the late}} 1860s, Andrew Carnegie's Keystone Bridge Company built the {{original}} Keokuk and Hamilton Bridge {{in the same}} location as the Keokuk Rail Bridge. [...] It was a , steel truss bridge that had one set of tracks and two lanes for wagon traffic. Pedestrian traffic was cantilevered out [...] {{on either side of}} the trusses. [...] A swing span on the Keokuk side allowed river traffic to cross. When the bridge opened in 1871, the first locomotive to cross the bridge crushed the pivot point of the swing span. [...] It was replaced a few days later. Ten years later, War Eagle, a river steamer sank after it collided with a <b>fixed</b> <b>span</b> of the bridge. Both the ship and bridge span were destroyed. Until the span was replaced, a wooden, covered bridge was built in its place.|$|E
2500|$|Songo Locks Bridge, Naples, Maine; carries Songo Lock Road {{over the}} Songo River just {{upstream}} of the lock. Not {{to be confused}} with a former swing bridge about two miles upstream which carried US 302 until replaced with a <b>fixed</b> <b>span</b> in May 2012.|$|E
2500|$|While cyclic {{codes in}} general are {{powerful}} tools for detecting burst errors, we now consider a family of binary cyclic codes named Fire Codes, which possess good single burst error correction capabilities. By single burst, say of length , we mean that all errors that a received codeword possess lie within a <b>fixed</b> <b>span</b> of [...] digits.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the route}} of the line was {{relatively}} flat ground, representing an easy route for construction of a railway. The main feature of the line was the wrought iron bridge crossing the River Ouse, the Skelton viaduct; at the time of construction it was amongst the largest opening bridges in the world, with a 250 ft swing span, and total length including <b>fixed</b> <b>spans</b> of 830 ft. The contractors for the bridge were Butler and Pitts of Stanningley (<b>fixed</b> <b>spans),</b> and Pease, Hutchingson and Company (Skerne Ironworks) for the swing span, with hydraulic machinery from William Armstrong (Newcastle upon Tyne).|$|R
50|$|The Cape Coral Bridge is {{a bridge}} located in Southwest Florida. It spans the Caloosahatchee River {{connecting}} Fort Myers and Cape Coral. It {{is made up}} of two parallel <b>fixed</b> <b>spans,</b> each 3400 ft long.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{superstructure}} {{was designed}} was T.E. Harrison of the NER, and erected by Pease, Hutchinson and Company (Skerne Ironworks). The <b>fixed</b> <b>spans</b> were supplied by Butler and Pitts (Stanningley), the hydraulic motors {{were of the}} design of Sir W.G. Armstrong.|$|R
2500|$|The Highlands-Sea Bright Bridge, a [...] {{drawbridge}} {{built in}} 1932, connected Highlands {{in the west}} to Sea Bright, New Jersey in the east, across the Shrewsbury River. The eastern terminus was at the entrance to Sandy Hook. The span was part of Route 36. The bridge has been replaced with a <b>fixed</b> <b>span</b> instead of a drawbridge. The new bridge rises [...] instead of the original span's [...]|$|E
2500|$|Paving of {{the route}} {{continued}} after the 1955 renumbering, extending south from Forked Island and west from Cameron. [...] Most of the work was completed by the mid-1960s. [...] The route {{on the east side}} of Pecan Island was shortened slightly by following the back ridge rather than the established road along the front ridge. [...] The last section of gravel road, located between Grand Chenier and Pecan Island, was hard surfaced around 1967. [...] The last ferry service on the Vermilion Parish portion of the highway was discontinued when a bridge was completed across the Schooner Bayou Canal (or Old Intracoastal Waterway) in 1965. [...] In 1976, the original movable bridge across the Intracoastal Waterway at Forked Island was replaced with the current high-level <b>fixed</b> <b>span.</b> [...] The location of the new bridge also allowed the straightening {{of the route}} through the area. [...] The most recent bridge replacement occurred in 2009 when a new fixed bridge was built spanning the Sabine Lake at the state line. [...] The original swing bridge had been damaged by Hurricanes Rita and Ike and was replaced with the help of federal relief funds.|$|E

50|$|Construction of the Saint Lawrence Seaway {{required}} {{the construction of}} twin vertical lift bridges replacing the exising <b>fixed</b> <b>spans.</b> This section has two elevator winches (functioning as a drawbridge) able to lift the section up to 70 ft above the initial level, {{in order to allow}} ships to pass.|$|R
25|$|The {{historical}} {{bridge was}} last raised in 1972. By the 1990s, the Corps of Engineers agreed to city plans {{to convert the}} Chicago River's lift bridges to <b>fixed</b> <b>spans.</b> As the surrounding area transformed from primarily industrial to residential and commercial in nature, traffic volumes on the aging bridge increasing, causing bottlenecks.|$|R
50|$|The {{substructure}} originally {{consisted of}} two masonry abutments and twenty-three masonry piers, {{as well as one}} pile foundation with a fender pier for the draw span. The superstructure was originally twenty-three cantilevered <b>fixed</b> <b>spans</b> and suspended spans, of plate girders with one swing span. The Boston abutment rests on vertical piles, while the Cambridge end is directly on gravel.|$|R

50|$|Between 2008 and 2011, the Highlands-Sea Bright Bridge, {{which was}} {{originally}} a drawbridge, {{was replaced with}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>span</b> with a clearance 30 ft higher than its predecessor.|$|E
50|$|The second bridge {{opened in}} 1894 and was built of iron for $88,500. It {{featured}} two 215 ft <b>fixed</b> <b>spans</b> {{and a single}} 200 ft swinging span in the center, with a walking path on the northern side. A trolley line was originally objected to by the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad but was ultimately added in the southern lane.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} east portals of the Mount Baker Ridge Tunnel, {{the bridge is}} an {{official}} City of Seattle landmark. While the bridge originally had an opening span {{at the center of}} the bridge to allow a horizontal opening of 202 ft for major waterborne traffic, the only boat passages currently are elevated <b>fixed</b> <b>spans</b> at the termini with 29 ft of vertical clearance.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} viaduct {{was designed}} by Brunel, with Fletcher as resident engineer. It was of typical design for one of Brunel's many viaducts, especially those on the coastal parts of the SWR, with timber construction and a small opening span to permit river traffic. It was 750 ft long with a 40 ft opening swing bridge at the Swansea (east) end. The seventeen <b>fixed</b> <b>spans</b> were of similar size.|$|R
50|$|When built, the bridge's longest span was a 316 ft <b>fixed</b> <b>span</b> {{located just}} {{to the north of}} the swing span; that section was later {{replaced}} by a lift span.|$|E
50|$|The swing {{section was}} {{deactivated}} {{and turned into}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>span</b> in 1963. In 1978-1979, a proposed renovation would have detonated explosives on the corroding piers, but the plan was altered so that the piers would get heavy refurbishment instead.|$|E

On the tasks of preposition selection and context-sensitive spelling correction, the supervised system reduces disambiguation error by 20 - 24 % over the current state-of-the-art. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{solve the}} formation-tracking control problem for mobile robots via linear control. As in the {{classical}} tracking control problem for two nonholonomic systems, the swarm is driven by a fictitious robot which moves about freely. Only one "leader" robot communicates with the reference vehicle and in turn, acts as a leader to a second robot hence forming a <b>fixed</b> <b>spanning</b> tree. We show that a simple condition on the reference angular velocity (persistency of excitation) suffices to achieve consensus tracking...|$|R
50|$|The bridge uses a truss bearing system, which {{accounted}} for its technical novelty. It was made of oak wood and iron. It consisted of 22 spans with spans from 22 to 24 m long. It had 18 major <b>fixed</b> <b>spans</b> erected on piles and it was 500 m long and 6 m wide. For its construction 735 chariots of Hungarian iron rails were used. The middle part {{was able to be}} opened to allow ships on the Vistula to pass.|$|R
50|$|The Gilmerton Bridge, a new drawbridge, {{was built}} to cross the Southern Branch Elizabeth River, a {{location}} which provides access to port facilities and is {{a portion of the}} Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.

50|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 1970s, {{the city}} sought to rebuild Flushing Bridge, by then 37 years old. This project, costing $10 million, was set to replace the current {{drawbridge}} with a taller <b>fixed</b> <b>span.</b> The Flushing Merchants Assem. and the Downtown Flushing Redevelopment Corp. opposed this plan.|$|E
25|$|After new {{manufacturing}} facilities {{opened on the}} Calumet River in the southern portion of Chicago, shipping traffic on the Chicago River fell dramatically. By the mid-1920s, the Department of Public Works had floated a proposal to replace the moving bridges with <b>fixed</b> <b>spans</b> through a ten-year period from 1925–1935, citing high maintenance costs. The proposal was not acted upon, partially due to opposition by the Army Corps of Engineers; however, except for a brief resurgence in traffic during World War II, shipping volume remained low.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fixed</b> <b>spans</b> were 116 ft long, made {{of three}} wrought iron hogback plate girders each, resting on three piers. The swing span was {{constructed}} of three hogback wrought iron box girders, each 250 ft long, each box girder having a thickness of 2 ft made of plates 0.3125 to 0.4375 in thick. In {{addition to the}} transverse deck girders the swing span was also braced by three transverse frames, which also served to support a bridgeman's hut over {{the centre of the}} bridge.|$|R
