5|$|I'll {{say that}} the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but {{pleasant}} because it brought satisfaction... But far be <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E

500|$|It {{had been}} {{unlikely}} that Hershiser would ever became a successful pitcher. He {{was unable to}} make his high school varsity team until he was a junior, and he went undrafted as a high schooler. He {{failed to make the}} Bowling Green State University team as a freshman, and after graduating, he struggled through two years in both Double A and Triple A baseball. Drysdale said that he enjoyed rooting for Hershiser because his jersey number, 55, like Drysdale's own number, 53, indicated that Hershiser had been a long shot to make the majors (lower numbers were generally assigned to better prospects in those days). [...] After the record was broken, Drysdale said he was not surprised that his record was broken. Even though Hershiser had the second-best (behind Dwight Gooden) career ERA among active pitchers, he believed that someone would surpass the record because he did not feel he was that great a pitcher, saying, [...] "I think someone's going to break <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> because I know I'm not any big deal".|$|E

500|$|Another {{possible}} lover was Bill Duckett. As a teenager, {{he lived}} on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him {{a number of years}} and serving him in various roles. Duckett was 15 when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, it is obvious that Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman's money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as [...] "thick". Though some biographers describe him as a boarder, others identify him as a lover. Their photograph [...] is described as [...] "modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait", part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male–male desire. Yet another intense relationship of Whitman with a young man was the one with Harry Stafford, with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek, and whom he first met when Stafford was 18, in 1876. Whitman gave Stafford a ring, which was returned and re-given {{over the course of a}} stormy relationship lasting several years. Of that ring, Stafford wrote to Whitman, [...] "You know when you put it on there was but one thing to part <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> and that was death." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1545, Charles Estienne was {{the first}} writer to {{identify}} the clitoris in a work based on dissection, but he concluded {{that it had a}} urinary function. Following this study, Realdo Colombo (also known as Matteo Renaldo Colombo), a lecturer in surgery at the University of Padua, Italy, published a book called De re anatomica in 1559, in which he describes the [...] "seat of woman's delight". In his role as researcher, Colombo concluded, [...] "Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus.", in reference to the mythological Venus, goddess of erotic love. Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at Padua, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tube), who claimed that he {{was the first}} to discover the clitoris. In 1561, Falloppio stated, [...] "Modern anatomists have entirely neglected it... and do not say a word about it... and if others have spoken of it, know that they have taken <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> or my students." [...] This caused an upset in the European medical community, and, having read Colombo's and Falloppio's detailed descriptions of the clitoris, Vesalius stated, [...] "It is unreasonable to blame others for incompetence on the basis of some sport of nature you have observed in some women and you can hardly ascribe this new and useless part, as if it were an organ, to healthy women." [...] He concluded, [...] "I think that such a structure appears in hermaphrodites who otherwise have well formed genitals, as Paul of Aegina describes, but I have never once seen in any woman a penis (which Avicenna called albaratha and the Greeks called an enlarged nympha and classed as an illness) or even the rudiments of a tiny phallus." ...|$|E

He installed in the college a master, Laurence Chaderton, three fellows, and four scholars; but subsequent benefactions soon increased the fellowships to fourteen and the scholarships to fifty. According to Fuller, Mildmay, on coming to court, after the college was opened was addressed by the Queen with the words: [...] "Sir Walter, I hear you have erected a puritan foundation", to which Mildmay replied: [...] "No, madam; far be <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> to countenance anything contrary to your established laws; but I have set an acorn, which when it becomes an oak, God alone knows {{what will be the}} fruit thereof".|$|E

In the spring of 1919 she appeared at the 44th Street Theatre for a run of almost 100 performances of Take <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>Me,</b> a musical comedy by Will R. Anderson and Will B. Johnstone. In the play she played Queenie LaBelle, a cinema vampire, who in one popular scene performs [...] "The Vampire Dance" [...] with Vernon [...] "Soup" [...] Van Dyke (Fred Hildebrand). That November at Boston’s Shubert Theatre, she began an eight-week run {{in the title role}} of Betty Be Good, a musical comedy from Harry B. Smith and Hugo Riesenfeld.

2500|$|During the war, Winston Churchill {{consulted}} {{him only}} once, in February 1943, on the advisability of his speaking out strongly against the continued neutrality of Éamon de Valera's Ireland. Baldwin saw {{the draft of}} Churchill's speech and advised against it, which advice Churchill followed. A few months after this visit to Churchill, Baldwin told Harold Nicolson, [...] "I went into Downing Street... a happy man. Of course it was partly because an old buffer like me enjoys feeling that he is still not quite out of things. But it was also pure patriotic joy that my country {{at such a time}} should have found such a leader. The furnace of the war has smeltered out all base metals from him". To D. H. Barber, Baldwin wrote of Churchill: [...] "You can take <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> he is a really big man, the War has brought out the best that was in him. His head isn't turned the least little bit by the great position he occupies {{in the eyes of the}} world. I pray he is spared to see us through".|$|E
2500|$|Opinion {{over the}} {{condition}} of Jews in Iran is divided. One Jew active in arguing {{on behalf of a}} benevolence view of the Iranian Islamic government and society toward Jews is film producer Haroun Yashayaei, who tells visitors and reporters the Ayatollah [...] "Ruhollah Khomeini didn't mix up our community with Israel and Zionism," [...] and [...] "Take <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> the Jewish community here faces no difficulties." [...] Privately many Jews complain to foreign reporters of [...] "discrimination, much of it of a social or bureaucratic nature." [...] The Islamic government appoints the officials who run Jewish schools, most of these being Muslims and requires that those schools must open on Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath. (This has apparently been changed as of February 4, 2015.) Criticism of this policy was the downfall of the last remaining newspaper of the Iranian Jewish community which was closed in 1991 after it criticized government control of Jewish schools. Instead of expelling Jews en masse like in Libya, Iraq, Egypt, and Yemen, the Iranians have adopted a policy of keeping Jews in Iran.|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] the Midrash {{told that}} the people {{realized}} that they had spoken against Moses and prostrated themselves before him and beseeched him to pray to God on their behalf. The Midrash taught that then [...] immediately reports, “And Moses prayed,” to demonstrate the meekness of Moses, who {{did not hesitate to}} seek mercy for them, and also to show the power of repentance, for as soon as they said, “We have sinned,” Moses was immediately reconciled to them, for one who {{is in a position to}} forgive should not be cruel by refusing to forgive. In the same strain, [...] reports, “And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed” (after Abimelech had wronged Abraham and asked for forgiveness). And similarly, [...] reports, “And the Lord changed the fortune of Job, when he prayed for his friends” (after they had slandered him). The Midrash taught that when one person wrongs another but then says, “I have sinned,” the victim is called a sinner if the victim does not forgive the offender. For in [...] Samuel told the Israelites, “As for me, far be <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you,” and Samuel told them this after they came and said, “We have sinned,” as [...] indicates when it reports that the people said, “Pray for your servants [...] [...] [...] for we have added to all our sins this evil.” ...|$|E
