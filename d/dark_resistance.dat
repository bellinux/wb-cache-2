40|$|Zide, Joshua M. O. (In) GaAs {{compounds}} containing low {{concentrations of}} Bi are called dilute bismuthides. When Bi is incorporated, bandgap narrowing occurs because of valence band anticrossing (VBAC). The ability to tune the bandgap {{of this material}} is useful {{in the field of}} optoelectronics. Dilute bismuthides, or more specifically n-InGaBiAs, is also expected to be a good thermoelectric material because Bi is a heavy atom and the conduction band should be similar to InGaAs. A heavy Bi atom can effectively scatter heat phonons, which reduces the thermal conductivity. With similar conduction band to InGaAs, a relatively high thermoelectric power factor is expected as well. This dissertation discusses the electrical and thermoelectric properties of n-InGaBiAs. The dissertation also briefly discusses how this material is ideal for mid-infrared transparent contacts. Transparent contacts are useful for devices such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and solar cells. However, traditional transparent contact materials like indium tin oxide (ITO) only work at the visible to near-infrared range. At midinfrared wavelengths, indium tin oxide is highly reflective due its plasma frequency. Dilute bismuthides are potential candidates for mid-infrared transparent contacts because they are transparent in mid-infrared wavelengths and have relatively low sheet resistances. ErAs or TbAs nanoparticles can be embedded in GaAs or InGaAs by codeposition via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). These materials have interesting properties that can be applied to thermoelectrics and terahertz technologies. For thermoelectrics, the nanoparticles have a dopant-like behavior and provide scattering centers for phonons. ErAs nanoparticles in GaAs provides the short carrier lifetimes and high <b>dark</b> <b>resistance</b> that is needed for a terahertz material. An interesting question one may ask is what will happen when both Er and Tb are co-deposited. It was hypothesized that core-shell nanoparticles would form through a strain-driven process when both Er and Tb are co-deposited. This dissertation discusses the observation of self-assembled rare-earth core-shell nanoparticles in InGaAs. The core-shell nanoparticles was observed using atom probe tomography (APT). The structure consisted of a mixed core (ErAs and TbAs) and a pure TbAs shell. A simple energetics model, which is also discussed in this dissertation, confirms the formation of core-shell nanoparticles. An application for InGaAs containing core-shell nanoparticles is terahertz technologies, or more specifically, a photoconductive switch. These nanoparticles are expected to provide the short carrier lifetimes and high <b>dark</b> <b>resistance</b> needed for THz applications using InGaAs, but more research needs to be performed. Unexpectedly, TbAs may appear to have a bandgap, rather than semimetal. A discussion about the band structure of TbAs is presented in this dissertation as well. Finally, this dissertation presents the future directions for these materials. For dilute bismuthides, materials with high Bi concentrations are ideal for mid-IR lasers, but growing these materials is not straightforward. This dissertation discusses some potential solutions to their growth and fabrication. For core-shell nanoparticles, more growths and characterization can be performed to determine how the rare-earth concentrations (or ratios) affect the number of core-shell nanoparticles. In conclusion, dilute bismuthides and (In) GaAs containing rare-earth, core-shell nanoparticles remain promising for applications in thermoelectrics, optoelectronics, and terahertz technologies.

40|$|Introduction: Aluminum {{is known}} as a {{neurotoxic}} element which causes neurodegeneration, learning deduction and movement disorders. Aluminum ions in the brain cause serious problems such as Alzheimer, Parkinson and other degenerative diseases. On the other hand, Zinc is a dietary element essential for several biological processes, modulates neurotransmission in brain regions and associates with cognition. Apoptosis plays a role in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Imbalances of this metal, either excess or deficiency, can result in neuronal apoptosis. Here we have studied the effect of their co-administration on memory and motor activity. Methods: Zinc chloride (30 mg/kg/day) and aluminum chloride (600 mg/kg/day) were co-administered in drinking water of male rats for two weeks. Two criteria were assessed in behavioral tests: latency to enter and time spent in <b>dark.</b> Motor <b>resistance</b> and coordination were evaluated in movement studies. Results: Experiments showed that following 2 weeks co-administration of ZnCl 2 (30 mg/kg/day) and AlCl 3 (600 mg/kg/day), passive avoidance memory and motor coordination have been improved (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Results suggest that zinc chloride consumption with (30 mg/kg/day) dose, could {{have a significant effect on}} memory and motor coordination and could prevent the negative effect of AlCl 3 on learning, memory and motor activity. Different mechanisms such as modulation of NMDA receptors and modulation of the entry of aluminum into the brain may be potentially involved in the observed effect of zinc. ...|$|R

40|$|Zide, JoshuaLanthanide monopnictides have {{properties}} {{that makes them}} interesting for many applications including thermoelectrics and photoconductive switches. Despite their usefulness, many of their fundamental properties remain unknown. This dissertation explores the fundamental properties of TbAs, both as nanoparticles and films. This dissertation also presents a novel lanthanide monopnictide nanocomposite as a possible candidate material for photoconductive switches. ☐ To study the electronic structure of TbAs we used fluence dependent optical pump terahertz probe measurements, revealing that TbAs nanoparticles saturate and are likely semiconductors. Spectrophotometry shows a large blue shift in the optical absorption energy when the matrix is changed from In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As to GaAs. To explore these differences, temperature dependent Hall effect measurements are utilized, revealing that TbAs: In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As is degenerately doped while TbAs:GaAs has the Fermi level located {{near the center of}} the GaAs band gap. These combined measurements indicate that TbAs forms a type I (straddled) heterojunction with GaAs and a type II (staggered) heterojunction with In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As. ☐ The study of TbAs nanoparticles revealed that TbAs is a semiconductor, but the band gap energy remains unknown. Films of TbAs were grown in an attempt to determine the band gap. Spectrophotometry reveals the optical band gap is dependent upon film thickness. Additionally, Hall effect measurements show that the films are degenerately doped with the carrier concentration also depending on thickness. Degenerately doping causes a Burstein-Moss shift in the optical absorption where the magnitude of the shift depends on carrier concentration, and thus thickness. ☐ In addition to studying the fundamental properties of TbAs, this dissertation explores ErAs:GaBiAs as a novel candidate material for photoconductive switches. Spectrophotometry measurements reveal that bismuth reduces the band gap, as expected, allowing these materials to be pumped with fiber-coupled lasers. Hall effect measurements reveal that ErAs pins the Fermi level within the band gap; resulting in a high <b>dark</b> <b>resistance</b> while maintaining a high mobility. The ErAs nanoparticles also provide a carrier recombination pathway that results in a short carrier lifetime, shown by transient absorption optical pump optical probe measurements.

40|$|In this thesis, {{a variety}} of topics related to high speed {{optoelectronic}} devices and measurement techniques using ultrafast optical pulses are presented. Following a brief introduction, the second chapter describes a Q-switched semi-conductor laser using a multi-quantum well active layer both for gain and as an intracavity loss modulator. While Q-Switching does not produce as short a pulse as modelocking, it does offer the advantage of adjustability of the repetition rate making it attractive as a source for digital communication links. It is also found to be preferred to the similar approach of gain switching due to less demanding requirements on the rf modulation power level and waveform. Results include a pulse width of ~ 20 ps which is fairly independent of the repetition rate, and a limiting repetition rate of 3. 2 GHz. The onset of an irregular pulse train which limits the maximum modulation frequency, is analyzed by a graphical approach. The potential for optical interconnects has motivated a marriage between the two technologies of Si VLSI and GaAs optoelectronics. Direct integration by the growth of GaAs on Si had been impossible, but the MBE and MOCVD techniques now enable the growth of such layers and of a quality suitable for devices. The third chapter describes the operating characteristics of GaAs-on-Si lasers and photodiodes with particular attention to their high speed performance. Both the lasers and photodiodes show comparable high speed performance to similar structures fabricated on GaAs, with most of the shortcomings being in their dc characteristics. In the fourth chapter, a novel approach to improving the resolution of photoconductive sampling is presented, called differential sampling. This technique obviates the need for carrier lifetime reduction usually used to improve temporal resolution, and is in principal only limited by a small (few ps) RC circuit time. An analysis of the minimum detectable signal voltage shows the technique does quite well compared with lifetime reduction techniques which also tend to reduce mobility and <b>dark</b> <b>resistance.</b> An experimental demonstration of this technique is presented in chapter five. Using a two gap sampler, accurate measurement (10 ps resolution) of a 60 ps pulse response from a photodiode is achieved using photoconductors with a recovery time of only 150 ps. Performance near the fundamental Johnson noise limit is also attained, though the minimum detectable signal is higher than predicted due to low response of the photoconductors (probably due to poor contacts). Finally, in chapter six, the possibility of retrieving an impulse response from its autocorrelation is explored. The use of the logarithmic Hilbert transform for phase retrieval has been discounted in the literature since most such work is concerned with imaging problems for which it is not appropriate due to their symmetric nature. However, causality and the decay nature of transient phenomena make this technique very suitable for use with the impulse response of passive devices. Conditions for the validity of this technique for temporal problems are presented. Simulated retrieval of two functions with similar autocorrelations is demonstrated with sufficient clarity to distinguish them, as well as showing good agreement with the original. Practical limitations and aspects [...] such as noise, finite time domain, etc. [...] are also simulated and discussed...|$|E

Currentvoltage characteristics (J-V) of a dark current is symmetric, as well as corresponds to the Ohm law for the voltages of 0 to 0. 4 V. In the voltage range of 0. 4 to 1. 0 V, the branch of J-V at the positive polarity (I₊) goes above that at the negative polarity (I₋) at a SnO₂- electrode.

A sudden current increasing occurs at 3.0  V (VSet), indicating a resistive switching from the high-resistance state (HRS or ‘OFF’) to the low-resistance state (LRS or ‘ON’), which was called the “Set” process. When the applied voltage sweeps from zero to negative voltage of about − 3.5  V (VReset), the device can return to the HRS, which was called the “Reset” process. The resistances of HRS and LRS at negative bias are much larger than those at positive bias. During the successive “Set” and “Reset” cycles on the same device, the device shows the identical I–V curves. The VReset and VSet are almost unchanged in subsequent cycles for the same device (not shown here). Moreover, the resistive switching behavior of Ag/BaWO 4 /FTO device is improved by white-light illumination. The I–V curve under white-light illumination is more symmetrical than that in the dark. And the resistive switching behavior at negative bias is more obvious than that in the <b>dark.</b> Furthermore, the <b>resistance</b> of LRS at negative bias is nearly as same as that at positive bias. In addition, the VSet (3.1  V) under white-light illumination is larger than that (3.0  V) in the dark.|$|R

6000|$|Browning's prejudices, however, belonged {{altogether}} to {{that healthy}} order which is characterised by a cheerful and satisfied ignorance. It never does a man any very great harm to hate {{a thing that}} he knows nothing about. It is the hating of a thing when we do know something about it which corrodes the character. We all have a <b>dark</b> feeling of <b>resistance</b> towards people we have never met, and a profound and manly dislike of the authors we have never read. It does not harm {{a man to be}} certain before opening the books that Whitman is an obscene ranter or that Stevenson is a mere trifler with style. It is the man who can think these things after he has read the books who must be in a fair way to mental perdition. Prejudice, in fact, {{is not so much the}} great intellectual sin as a thing which we may call, to coin a word, [...] "postjudice," [...] not the bias before the fair trial, but the bias that remains afterwards. With Browning's swift and emphatic nature the bias was almost always formed before he had gone into the matter. But almost all the men he really knew he admired, almost all the books he had really read he enjoyed. He stands pre-eminent among those great universalists who praised the ground they trod on and commended existence like any other material, in its samples. He had no kinship with those new and strange universalists of the type of Tolstoi who praise existence to the exclusion of all the institutions they have lived under, and all the ties they have known. He thought the world good because he had found so many things that were good in it--religion, the nation, the family, the social class. He did not, like the new humanitarian, think the world good because he had found so many things in it that were bad.|$|R
