40|$|Department of PhysicsThe plasma wakefield {{accelerator}} is one {{of promising}} and advanced particle accelerator models. It can make particle accelerator more compact and cheaper. A beam bunch propagating through plasma excites the plasma wakefield at some conditions. The optimum wake is obtained for k_p*σ_z = sqrt(2) and k_p*σ_r ≤ 1. Where k_p is plasma wave number and σ_z (or σ_r) is RMS beam length (or RMS beam radius). But {{we are interested in}} using CERN’s long and high-energy proton beams. The CERN’s proton beams are much longer (~ 12 cm) than the optimum <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> length (in order of plasma wavelength λ_p). Here we focus on the instability which occurs based on the interaction between beam and plasma electrons. By this instability, the long <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> is modulated along the propagation direction, so it makes the beam satisfy the optimum size for excitation of plasma waves. What we should know is that the plasma oscillation which is initially and axi-symmetrically excited by beam head will seed self-modulation of <b>driving</b> <b>beam.</b> Therefore, we first study fundamental theories of excitation of plasma waves by the charged particle beam. It’s about the response of plasma electrons to <b>driving</b> <b>beam.</b> The <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> doesn’t interact with and only affects plasma. Here excited plasma wakefields should be considered. As the next step, the dynamics of plasma wakefield accelerator is introduced. Evolution of beam envelope in time could result in beam centroid offset or radius pinching. Where the two phenomena, centroid offset and radius pinching of the beam in plasma are called ‘Self-modulation instability’ and ‘Hose instability’. Those two instabilities compete each other. As the last step, the parameters of Injector Test Facility (ITF) at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) is used to demonstrate the self-modulation instability. ope...|$|E

However the large driving amplitude leads to the nonlinear effect. As a result, the resonance frequency is dependent with the driving amplitude, which influences the frequency stability of gyroscope. The equivalent model of <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> is established, and the stiffness formulas of <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> are derivated according to the large deflection theory. The linear stiffness of <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> is 270. 1 N/m and the nonlinear stiffness is 3. 237 × 108 N/m 3, which are 2. 7 % and 6. 4 % different from the simulative results.

The theoretical analysis results are carried out compared with the simulative analysis results. Also the impact of driving amplitude on resonance frequency is confirmed by experiment test.
