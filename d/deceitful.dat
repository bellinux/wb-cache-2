5|$|In 1776 Bewick {{became a}} partner in Beilby's workshop. The joint {{business}} prospered, becoming Newcastle's leading engraving service with an enviable reputation for high quality work and good service. In September 1776 he went to London for eight months, finding the city rude, <b>deceitful</b> and cruel, and much disliking the unfairness of extreme wealth and poverty side by side. He returned to his beloved Newcastle {{as soon as he}} could, but his time in the capital gave him a wider reputation, business experience, and an awareness of new movements in art.|$|E

She {{is portrayed as}} greedy, uneducated and <b>deceitful,</b> someone who regularly revised her life story and was interested only in making money. The authors produce witness statements from Eddy's childhood alleging that she engaged in repeated fainting spells to gain attention or avoid punishment, particularly from her father, and that, as an adult, she developed a habit of appearing to be seriously ill only to recover quickly.|$|E
5|$|While {{music was}} his true passion, Adkins enjoyed {{a career in}} the film and {{television}} industry. He played himself as a street musician in 2004's The Heart Is <b>Deceitful</b> Above All Things, partially narrated The Red's Breakfast Experience and starred in a comedic horror film entitled Die You Zombie Bastards!. As a composer he helped score Hair High in 2004. Adkins was also the subject of the Julien Nitzberg documentary The Wild World of Hasil Adkins, distributed by Appalshop.|$|E
5|$|Women {{are neither}} victims of <b>deceitful</b> men nor overdefensive virgins, but {{individuals}} who {{can choose to}} 'bestow' their favours on a man who will 'enjoy' them. In the earliest examples of the redefinition that develops throughout Fielding's works, virtue is no longer simply virginity, but something malleable and powerful {{in the hands of}} a woman granted the agency and intelligence to determine her own sexuality.|$|E
5|$|The cunning Fox is {{commonly}} found in Native American mythology, where it is portrayed as an almost constant companion to Coyote. Fox, however, is a <b>deceitful</b> companion that often steals Coyote's food. In the Achomawi creation myth, Fox and Coyote are the co-creators of the world, that leave just {{before the arrival of}} humans. The Yurok tribe believed that Fox, in anger, captured the sun, and tied him to a hill, causing him to burn a great hole in the ground. An Inuit story tells of how Fox, portrayed as a beautiful woman, tricks a hunter into marrying her, only to resume her true form and leave after he offends her. A Menominee story tells of how Fox is an untrustworthy friend to the Wolf.|$|E

25|$|An {{assault by}} the English using a <b>deceitful</b> ruse ended the siege when the {{defenders}} {{were all but}} put to the sword. The victory proved decisive in two ways; first it denied the Spanish an important large independent base and port from which to operate in Brittany against the English and Dutch. Second the Spanish had lost most of their support from the French Catholic League {{and as a result}} enabled Henry to declare war on Spain.|$|E
25|$|Best's last {{competitive}} {{game for}} the club was on 1 January 1974 against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road, which United lost 3–0. He failed to turn up for training three days later and was dropped by Docherty, though he claimed Docherty was <b>deceitful</b> with him. Best {{was arrested and charged}} with stealing a fur coat, passport, and cheque book from Marjorie Wallace, but was later cleared of all charges. United went on to suffer relegation into the Second Division in 1973–74.|$|E

25|$|McGraw was sued by Thomas Riccio, the memorabilia {{collector}} {{responsible for}} taping the Las Vegas robbery {{that led to}} O. J. Simpson's being convicted. Riccio sued McGraw in Los Angeles Superior Court for defamation, fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false light for what Riccio claims to have been <b>deceitful</b> editing of the Dr. Phil Show on which he appeared in early October 2008. The claims of defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false light were dismissed, with the judge finding that it was protected speech under the first amendment.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{alleged that}} Clinton was <b>deceitful</b> in this, and {{retained}} public interest law firm, and frequent Clinton opponent, Judicial Watch to represent {{him in a}} series of civil and criminal lawsuits against the Clintons, the Clinton campaign, and ultimately the Federal Election Commission (which he charged was negligent in failing to convict Mrs. Clinton). These charges were delayed, as courts held that Paul could not bring charges against the Clintons as he fought extradition from Brazil (to which he had fled in 2001 to escape Stan-Lee-Media-related criminal charges, see below), but proceeded once he was returned to the States.|$|E
25|$|A few in{{transitive}}s {{derive from}} transitive roots through the suffix -ek, {{though this is}} a fossilized suffix {{and is no longer}} productive. For example, dierek (to be found) from diar (to find); dilipek (for a thatch roof to be mended) from dilip (to mend a thatch roof). Sometimes this results in two intransitive derivations of a single transitive root, usually with a semantic nuance: transitive wengid (to wring), intransitive wengiweng (to wring/be wrung), intransitive wengidek (to be twisted); transitive widinge (to deceive), intransitive widing (to deceive/be deceived); intransitive widingek (to be <b>deceitful).</b> The suffix was apparently much more productive earlier in the language's history, even among active verbs.|$|E
25|$|The ALP, minor {{parties and}} the ACTU {{attacked}} the advertising campaign, with ACTU President Sharan Burrow describing the advertisements as <b>deceitful</b> party-political advertising funded through taxes. The Government argued that such expenditure is normal procedure when introducing radical change, citing {{the example of the}} GST advertising. However, that advertising was severely criticised at the time, and for the same reasons. The expenditure was challenged in the High Court of Australia by the ALP and the ACTU, in Combet v Commonwealth, {{on the grounds that the}} expenditure was not approved by Parliament. On 29 September 2005 the High Court rejected this argument in a majority decision.|$|E
25|$|In an anecdotal account, Simmons {{reported}} that a female marsh harrier courted a male to obtain access to food he had stored. She then took this food and fed it to chicks that had been fathered by another male. More extensive studies focused on possibly <b>deceitful</b> behaviour in the pied flycatcher, a species in which males may possess more than one territory. Females gain from mating with a male that has no other mates and males may try to deceive females about their mating status (mated or unmated). Females frequently visit the male, {{and if he is}} always alone on his territory he is probably unmated. Thus, by repeated sampling of male behaviour, females are usually able to avoid mating with previously mated males.|$|E
25|$|Patricia {{finds herself}} {{tangling}} with shady businessman Roger Carlyle (Leslie Dayman) {{and his son}} Luke (Peter Cousens). Shortly after Luke embezzles Patricia's company, he is found murdered and Patricia becomes the prime suspect, leading {{to a series of}} attempts on her life orchestrated by Roger. Other new characters introduced during the season include Irene Fisher (Judy Nunn), a GP who opens a new boarding house with Fiona, Karen Fox (Lyndel Rowe), a <b>deceitful</b> businesswoman who wreaks havoc {{in the lives of the}} other characters whilst having a romantic affair with Wayne, Ross Newman (Robin Stewart), a criminal surgeon working under the instructions of Roger Carlyle, and Bob 'Mitch' Mitchell (Philip Quast), an ex-convict who becomes romantically involved with Amanda whilst coming to blows with Karen and Wayne.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} the 11 {{soldiers}} turned public opinion against {{the peace process and}} boosted the popularity of its main opponent, Álvaro Uribe. In an Ipsos poll, Santos' approval fell from 40% to 29% compared to November 2014, pessimism in the peace process increased 16 points to 69% during the same period and former President Uribe's favourable image increased from 41% to 57%. Nevertheless, only 27% of respondents in the poll wanted to break off dialogues and launch a military offensive. For a skeptical public, the FARC's attack was sign that their ceasefire had been <b>deceitful</b> and only heightened frustration with a peace process which had recorded no formal agreement since May 2014. However, according to the Conflict analysis resource centre (Cerac), the attack on the soldiers was the only severe violation of the ceasefire, given that the FARC had generally complied with their ceasefire up to that point, resulting in the lowest levels of violence in the conflict since 1984.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, White wrote The Vivisector, {{a searing}} {{character}} portrait of an artist. Many people drew {{links to the}} Sydney painter John Passmore (1904–84) and White's friend, the painter Sidney Nolan, but White denied the connections. Patrick White was an art collector who had, as a young man, been deeply impressed by his friends Roy De Maistre and Francis Bacon, and later said {{he wished he had}} been an artist. White's elaborate, idiosyncratic prose was a writer's attempt to emulate painting. By the mid-1960s, he had also become interested in encouraging dozens of young and less established artists, such as James Clifford, Erica McGilchrist, and Lawrence Daws. White was later friends with Brett Whiteley, the young star of Australian painting, in the 1970s. That friendship ended when White felt that Whiteley, a heroin addict, was <b>deceitful</b> and pushy about selling his paintings. A portrait of White by Louis Kahan won the 1962 Archibald Prize.|$|E
25|$|Our {{authorities}} speak {{very little}} of his character. An inference may, however, be drawn {{on the basis of}} his performance. Ambitious, bold and rapacious, Churaman was cunning to an unusual degree. Certain traits of his character suggest that as a person he was complex. His movements after the murder of Husain Ali reflect his coolness and foresight, but the case of his suicide reveals his sense of devotion and gratitude. At the same time his conduct in the wars of succession generally testifies to his being unscrupulous and <b>deceitful.</b> Similarly, while his treatment and imperious disposition, the way he held back in face of extreme provocation from his eldest son, Muhkam Singh, speaks of his occasional resignation and self-restraint. Churaman displayed a passionate love for money and plunder throughout his life. Examples of occasional loot were not wanting among the Jats either before or after him. But no other Jat leader of his caliber had ever given himself to plunder to this extent.|$|E
25|$|The Yamasees had {{collected}} extensive debt {{in the first}} decade of the 1700s due to buying manufactured goods on credit from traders, and then not being able to produce enough deerskins to pay the debt later on in the year. Indians who were not able to pay their debt were often enslaved. The practice of enslavement extended to the wives and children of the Yamsees in debt as well. This process frustrated the Yamasees and other tribes, who lodged complaints against the <b>deceitful</b> credit-loaning scheme traders had enforced, along with methods of cheating or trade. The Yamasees were a coastal tribe in the aread that is now known as South Carolina, and most of the white-tailed deer herds had moved inland for the better environment. The Yamasees rose up against the English in South Carolina, and soon other tribes joined them, creating combatants from almost every nation in the South. The British were able to defeat the Indian coalition with help from the Cherokees, cementing a pre-existing trade partnership.|$|E
25|$|Philo {{wrote that}} God {{instructed}} the Israelites to offer unleavened bread and bitter herbs {{together with the}} Passover sacrifice because unleavened bread signified great haste and speed, while bitter herbs signified the life of bitterness and struggle that the Israelites endured as slaves. Philo also taught that the deeper meaning was that leavened and fermented foods rose, while unleavened foods remained low, and each of these states symbolized types of the soul. Leavening symbolized the haughty soul swollen with arrogance, while the unleavened symbolized the unchangeable and prudent soul choosing the middle way rather than extremes. The bitter herbs manifested a psychic migration from passion to impassivity and from wickedness to virtue. For, Philo taught, those who naturally and genuinely repented became bitter toward their former way of life, lamenting {{the time that they}} had given over to the seductive and <b>deceitful</b> mistress of desire, being deceived by desire when they ought to have renewed themselves and advanced in the contemplation of wisdom toward the goal of a happy and immortal life. And so, those who desired repentance ate the unleavened bread with bitter herbs; they first ate bitterness over their old and unendurable life, and then ate the opposite of boastful arrogance in meditation on humility. For, Philo concluded, the memory of former sins caused fear, and by restraining sin through recollection, brought profit to the mind.|$|E
25|$|Professor Katarina Sjöberg {{argues in}} The Wall Street Culture {{that within the}} media {{negative}} images of Wall Street are painted {{in terms of the}} district's market falls, money losses and <b>deceitful</b> gains. However, this is not what Wall Street investors are bothered by. Instead, it is the public's words and opinions which they feel mold their image. Sjöberg notes that in the American culture, money making is of utmost importance and knowing how to make money is considered to be respectable. Therefore, Wall Street investors prioritize their work as well as strive to climb the corporate ladder. They also feel obligated to maintain the image the public creates, because it strengthens their position as a Wall Street employee. They value seeing themselves as experts in their field, especially since they live in a society that values wealth. This justifies their acts of greed, and allows them to take part in activities often deemed as criminal because they feel as though it is expected. Moreover, they do not regret their actions because to them, it is part of being an American. Aside from living up to the public's image, Wall Street workers justify their high salaries with an argument pointed out by Karen Ho in Disciplining Investment Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis, the Downsizing of Corporate America. She argues that {{due to the fact that}} the financial market is volatile in conjunction with the existence of job insecurity, Wall Street workers are compensated through their salaries.|$|E
