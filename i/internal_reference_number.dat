These flaws have all been described previously in the open literature, but in widely separated places. For those new {{to the field of}} computer security, they provide a good introduction to the characteristics of security flaws and how they can arise. Because these flaws were not randomly selected from a valid statistical sample of such flaws, we make no strong claims concerning the likely distribution of actual security flaws within the taxonomy. However, this method of organizing security flaw data can help those who have custody of more representative samples to organize them and to focus their efforts to remove and, eventually, to prevent the introduction of security flaws.

Methods Hep- 2 cells and 14 laryngeal cancer tissue samples were investigated. The expression characteristics of 12 <b>internal</b> <b>reference</b> gene candidates (18 S rRNA, GAPDH, ACTB, HPRT 1, RPL 29, HMBS, PPIA, ALAS 1, TBP, PUM 1, GUSB, and B 2 M) were assessed by RT-qPCR. The data were analyzed by three commonly used software programs: geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. Results The use of the combination of four <b>internal</b> <b>reference</b> genes was more appropriate than the use of a single <b>internal</b> <b>reference</b> gene. The optimal combination was PPIA + GUSB + RPL 29 + HPRT 1 for both the cell line and tissues; while the most appropriate combination was GUSB + RPL 29 + HPRT 1 + HMBS for the tissues.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is {{on the effects of}} specific employer characteristics on wages and wage rigidity and how these characteristics enter the wage-setting process. The dissertation includes an introductory chapter and five separate essays. The introduction provides motivation, background on the main keywords and an overview of the thesis. Chapters two and three study how <b>internal</b> <b>references</b> affect wages and wage rigidity from a theoretical perspective. The fourth chapter estimates the effect of firm size on wages in the Finnish labor market. Chapter five develops on the preceding and analyses how profit sharing schemes affect the firm size premium. Chapter six studies how <b>internal</b> <b>references</b> can induce profit sharing and wage rigidity from an empirical perspective. Chapter two analyses how fairness considerations of workers affect the union wagesetting process and ultimately on wages, employment and wage rigidity. Fairness is modeled as <b>internal</b> <b>reference</b> where workers compare wages to firm productivity respectively profitability. If the <b>internal</b> <b>reference</b> is high relative to the outside option, wage pressure results through a productivity/profitability premium as well as real wage rigidity. The third chapter reviews the core research on <b>internal</b> <b>references</b> and wage rigidity. With one exception it suggests that <b>internal</b> <b>references</b> unambiguously increase wage rigidity. In contrast, this chapter provides analytical proofs, calibration results and impulse response functions which show that the effect is ambiguous. The effect of the <b>internal</b> <b>reference</b> relative to the external reference determines whether wage rigidity increases or decreases. Chapter four explores the relationship between wages and firm size in the Finnish labor market. Using a large register data set the effect of firm size is found to be negligible after controlling for a large set of worker and firm characteristics and across different identification strategies. Chapter five analyzes the interaction of the firm size wage premium and profit sharing schemes. A simple theoretical analysis shows that the firm-size wage premium decreases in the presence of profit sharing. Using a rich linked employer-employee data set the empirical analysis shows that besides profit sharing, assortative matching and monopsony behavior decrease the firm size premium. The sixth chapter analyses the connection between profit sharing and wage rigidity where profits per worker are measured directly through the balance sheet panel. Profit endogeneity is accounted for by instrumentation as well as the self-selection of firms in different categories of profitability. Profits are shared if positive or increasing while there is no downward adjustment of wages if profits are negative or decreasing. This finding suggests that profits per worker function as <b>internal</b> <b>reference...</b>|$|R

However, when using RT-PCR to detect bacte-rial contamination, several intractable points must be considered, one of which is the lack of appropriate quality control. In this study, we developed a simplified RT-PCR assay in which the same primer set and two distinct probes were used to detect both, an <b>internal</b> <b>reference</b> control and the target in a reaction. The copy <b>number</b> of the <b>internal</b> <b>reference</b> control repre-sents the positive detection limit of the assay; therefore, when the threshold-cycle value of the target is {{less than or equal to}} that of the <b>internal</b> <b>reference</b> control, the result obtained for the target can be considered to be a true positive. When human gDNA was spiked with Escherichia coli gDNA and the detection limit for the <b>internal</b> <b>reference</b> control was set to five copies, the measured detection limit for E. coli gDNA was two copies. The internal refer-ence control duplex RT-PCR assay showed high efficiency (0. 91 – 1. 02), high linearity (R 2 > 0. 99), and good reproducibility in intra- and inter-assay comparisons. Lastly, when human platelet-rich plasma samples were spiked with E. coli or other bacterial species, all species were detected efficiently, and the results of a two-sample pooled t test showed that the limit of detection for E. coli was 1 cfu/mL.

The present research looks at {{the extent to which}} an advertised, or external, reference price included in a price promotion affects consumers' price beliefs. According to Helson's Adaptation-Level theory, consumers form an <b>internal</b> <b>reference</b> price, which they use as a basis for evaluating market prices. The process by which <b>internal</b> <b>reference</b> price can change according to an external reference price is, then, explained by a conjoint Adaptation-Level and Assimilation-Contrast theories. It is suggested that consumers may assimilate or contrast an external reference price and that only an assimilated price has the ability to affect the <b>internal</b> <b>reference</b> price. A first experiment was conducted to examine the extent to which consumers assimilate an external reference price. Findings from the present research suggested that, contrary to the predictions of the Assimilation-Contrast theory, the impact of an external reference price on consumers' internal price standards was monotonic. It was further suggested that this assimilation might be moderated by individual differences. A second experiment was conducted to examine the differential effects of two types of semantic cues. However, in the research, no differences were found between absolute and relative savings presentation formats.
