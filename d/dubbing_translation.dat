(Linguistics) The {{objective}} of language dubbing {{is to allow}} a target language audience access {{to the world of}} meaning of a film in a foreign language - {{in such a way that}} the impression is created, the film was originally made in the target language. It is the task of the dubbing translator to try and evoke a similar response from the target language audience as the original evokes from a source language audience. This study seeks to offer a model for the assessment of equivalence with regard to <b>dubbing</b> <b>translation.</b> The necessity for a special criticism model for <b>dubbing</b> <b>translation</b> stems from the fact that extra-linguistic factors limit and often dominate the language component to such an extent that most evaluation models are inadequate. In this study the extra-linguistic components of communication are incorporated in the model once equivalence with regard to <b>dubbing</b> <b>translation</b> has been clearly defined. In the last part of the study the model is tested on excerpts from dubbed programmes and it is shown how the model can be used as a check list for analysing a source language text with a view to establishing a suitable niveau de langue for creating character dialogue...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exercise}} in descriptive translation studies (DTS) which sets out to investigate the much neglected area of screen translation for children. The corpus selected for investigation is a collection of six original television programmes from the German Janoschs Traumstunde animation series and the corresponding Irish dubbed versions. The aim of this research is to investigate the relative influence of the various constraints imposed on the target texts by a) the major/minority language pair, 1 e German/Irish, b) the translation method, 1 e dubbing and c) the target audience, 1 e children. The mam focus of the comparative section of this thesis is the translation of lexis, especially LSP terms. The findings show that lexical simplification is a widespread feature of the Irish dubbed translations. It is argued that the prevalence of lexical simplification in the target language text cannot be explained, as one might have expected, simply in terms of the typical problems experienced by minority languages in relation to modern specialised terminology, but rather must be seen as also a result of a) technical aspects of the dubbing process and b) the attitude and assumptions of the Irish <b>dubbing</b> <b>translation</b> team with regard to the purpose of the translation and the linguistic needs and capabilities of the children who constitute the primary target audience While the primary {{purpose of this study is}} to describe a contemporary example of minority language dubbing for children, it is also hoped that its findings will contribute to changes in aspects of dubbing studio practice and screen translator training and ultimately result in improved standards of screen translation practice and criticism...|$|E
40|$|Treball de fi de grau en Traducció i InterpretacióBritish {{television}} comedies {{have always}} had a really good reception from the Catalan audience, mainly through the Catalan autonomous channel, TV 3. In the process of translating to the target language, especially in the beginning of Catalan dubbing, the translator has to face the translation of linguistic elements as well as the humour of the dialogues keeping in mind the language model established by the aforesaid channel. In this essay I have analysed the <b>dubbing</b> <b>translation</b> from English to Catalan of the well-known British television comedy Fawlty Towers to observe how this translation fits in the context that has been previously described and to determine how this has affected the dubbing final result. In an effort to achieve final conclusions, l have chosen a wide range of examples thai, as well as they show the translator's capacity of solving problems related to the translation itself, they also indicate his relationship with the linguistic model established by the Catalan television. The examples have been divided into linguistic and humorous aspects and the different strategies the translator has used in order to successfully process the information from English to Catalan have been determined. The results show how the translator has generally followed the autonomous channel guidelines and ha. ~ created a rather genuine text in Catalan, (even though in certain occasions he moves away from the established language model) which works well in the target culture and maintains the humorous effect of the original version. However, I have found appropriate to suggest altemative translations in some cases l thought the target text could be improved according to the general criteria applied to the text by the translator.

40|$|D. Litt et Phil. This thesis {{constitutes}} {{an investigation into}} the specific nature of translation for the screen and television. To this end, three films, dubbed into Afrikaans from English, French and German respectively, are studied. The language dubbing translator is faced with specific challenges such as extra-linguistic and paralinguistic factors, the most important of which is the synchronization of target language solutions with the visible lip movements of characters. These constraints compel the translator to employ various translation strategies, such as insertion, deletion and substitution. The study argues that, in view of the number of deviations from the source text, the term equivalence cannot be used to describe the relationship between the source and target text. Since the task of the dubbing translator is to create dialogue that has to be spoken by dubbing actors, the study further argues that playability can be the only true test for the success of a <b>dubbing</b> <b>translation.</b> No single definition exists for the term playability. Whereas most actors and directors can distinguish a playable text or translation from one that is not, owing to their drama training, only some dubbing translators have an instinctive feel for it. As drama training for dubbing translators is not an option, the study takes the most salient aspect of playability, namely character dialogue, as starting point and sets as its main objective the development of an instrument that would enable translators, without the above-mentioned intuitive unconscious competence, to create playable character dialogue for individual characters. Using Bateson's theory of Logical Types and Dilts's theory of Logical Levels, a congruence model is developed. Adding insights from various disciplines, such as Visual Communication and Semiotics, the model is expanded to consist of three components: visual, paralinguistic and linguistic. The model is tested next by being used for the analysis of the corpus of films. The study finds that by analysing the visual, paralinguistic and linguistic components, and their relations to one another, according to focus areas such as Environment, Behaviour, Skills and Capabilities, Values and Beliefs, and Identity, not only are the intentions of characters clearly established, but the intention of the original sender is also revealed. This enables the dubbing translator to create character dialogue that achieves congruence among all the different levels. The study argues in conclusion that the model can also be used for the analysis and translation of other text types. Whereas the objective of the study is to make a contribution to the field of Translation Theory, the various applications suggest that the thesis also contributes to the following fields of study: Applied Linguistics, Literary Theory and Communication Studie...|$|E

40|$|In Italian, grazie ‘thanks’ and ringraziare ‘to thank’ {{historically}} {{introduce a}} recipient {{by means of}} the preposition di ‘of’ (Renzi et al 1991 : 545 - 548); when grazie and ringraziare introduce a subordinate infinite clause, they may all the same be followed by either di or per ‘for’, the latter being the habitual preposition introducing an implicit causal subordinate (Renzi et al ibid.). In light of these considerations, a general lower frequency of occurrence of collocations with per would be expected. However, a number of authors (e. g., Renzi 2000, Alfieri et al 2008 : 331) have reported an increase in the use of constructions with per; though with differences in the approach and the framework employed, they have also hypothesised that such an increase may be due to language contact with English. A careful exploration of the relevant literature, however, has revealed that such claims of both an increase in the use of grazie/ringraziare per in Italian and of an influence from English as the cause of the increase have so far outpaced empirical substantiation. This study, on the contrary, uses verifiable and objective data such as diachronic language corpora of written, spoken and dubbed Italian to empirically investigate the distribution of both constructions through the history of Italian. The results will reveal that, from 1200 to 2011, the frequency of use of forms with per has indeed more than octupled in writing and that, from 1965 to 2004, has more than doubled in speech. Moreover, by analysing the distribution of the studied constructions in a corpus of dubbed Italian from (American) English, the article will also explore the possibility that language contact with English, mainly via <b>dubbing</b> <b>translations,</b> may have played a concurrent fundamental role for such changes...|$|R

However, in Study 2, the subtitling (vs. dubbing) of a more complex film leads to more effortful processing and lower cognitive performance, but not to a lessened appreciation. These results expose the boundaries of subtitle processing, which are reached only when the audiovisual material to be processed is complex, and they encourage scholars and practitioners to reconsider old standards as well as to invest more effort in crafting diverse types of audiovisual translations tailored both on the degree of complexity of the source product and on the individual differences of the target viewers...|$|R

As part of the promotion campaign, Lightning and monsters from the XIII series featured in a series of player events in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{barriers}} to the reuse of Open Educational Resources (OER) is language (OLnet, 2009). OER may be available but in a language that users cannot access, so a preliminary step to reuse is their translation or localization. One of the obvious solutions to the vast effort required to translate OER is to crowd-source the translation, as exemplified by Wikipedia (Wikipedia Translation) or TED (Ted Open Translation Project). From October to December 2012 the Department of Languages at the Open University UK ran a MOOC on Open Translation Tools and Practices (OT 12). Participants explored a range of online open translation tools (Amara, Transifex, Google Translator Toolkit) that enable and facilitate the crowdsourcing of <b>translation,</b> <b>dubbing</b> and subtitling. For this MOOC, participants collaborated in the translation and subtitling of OER mainly to and from English and Spanish, but also Portuguese, French, Greek, German and Catalan. Forum discussions, synchronous online sessions, recorded podcasts and the tasks themselves were designed to provide input, facilitate discussion and share views {{not only on the}} linguistic specificities of translating different languages, but also on issues such as quality assurance in open translation and the ethics and practicalities of openness in education and translation. Data for this paper is drawn from online surveys covering participants' backgrounds and their prior experience as translators; their expectations and motivation for participating in the OT 12 MOOC; and their evaluation of the outcomes of the MOOC. We understand MOOCs as events (Cormier, 2010) or, following the principles of connectivism, catalysts for starting conversations within a network (Downes, 2011), and therefore feel that they might be a suitable way of engaging online communities of translators, language teachers and learners, and those interested in the crowdsourcing of translations for OER. This paper attempts to open up a debate on how the world of open education can harness crowdsourcing and existing open translation models to further the openness agenda. ...|$|R
