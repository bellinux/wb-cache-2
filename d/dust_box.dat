His round began at half-past six in the morning, when he would descend unwashed and shirtless, in old clothes and a scarf, and <b>dust</b> <b>boxes</b> and yawn, and take down wrappers and clean the windows until eight. Then {{in half an hour}} he would complete his toilet and take an austere breakfast of bread and margarine and what only an Imperial Englishman would admit to be coffee, after which refreshment he ascended to the shop for the labours of the day. Commonly these began with a mighty running to and fro with planks and boxes and goods for Carshot, the window-dresser, who, whether he worked well or ill, nagged persistently by reason of a chronic indigestion, until the window was done. Sometimes the costume window had to be dressed, and then Kipps staggered down the whole length of the shop from the costume room with one after another of those ladylike shapes grasped firmly, but shamefully, each about her single ankle of wood. Such days as there was no window-dressing, there was a mighty carrying and lifting of blocks and bales of goods into piles and stacks. After this there were terrible exercises, at first almost despairfully difficult: certain sorts of goods that came in folded had to be rolled upon rollers, {{and for the most part}} refused absolutely to be rolled, at any rate by Kipps; and certain other sorts of goods that came from the wholesalers rolled had to be measured and folded, which folding makes young apprentices wish they were dead. All of it, too, quite avoidable trouble, you know, that is not avoided because of the cheapness of the genteeler sorts of labour and the dearness of forethought in the world. And then consignments of new goods had to be marked off and packed into proper parcels; and Carshot packed like conjuring tricks, and Kipps packed like a boy with tastes in some other direction--not ascertained. And always Carshot nagged.|$|R

Complementary observations provided by dropsondes released from the same platform as well as airborne wind measurements made from another platform (the DLR Falcon 20, flying in coordination with the SAFIRE Falcon 20) evidenced that the lifting was associated with {{the leading edge of the}} monsoon low level jet, and to be transported southward by the harmattan, above the monsoon layer. A 10 -day numerical simulation, using the mesoscale model Meso-NH (including the <b>dust</b> emission <b>box</b> <b>Dust</b> Entrainment And Deposition model), was conducted to assess the representativity of the observed phenomenon as well as the mechanisms associated with the Sahelian dust emissions.

In the simulation, large dust uptakes associated with the leading edge of the monsoon flow, with a dust concentration reaching 2000 μg/m 3, and to be transported southward by the harmattan, above the monsoon layer, were well reproduced. On the other hand, the simulation suggested the existence of dust emissions associated with the harmattan flow which were not observed by airborne lidar measurements. The reason for the discrepancy between the model results and the lidar observations is investigated...|$|R

The main requirements of the buncher are to operate in cw mode with a velocity acceptance of 2. 2 % and an effective voltage of 100 kV, which for a three gap buncher gives a drift tube voltage of 30 kV. A lumped element circuit is more suitable than a distributed rf structure for this low frequency of operation.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{toxicity}} tests capable of recognizing indoor environments with compromised air quality, especially in the context of moisture damage. One of the key issues is sampling, which should both provide meaningful material for analyses and fulfill requirements imposed by practitioners using toxicity tests for health risk assessment. We aimed to evaluate different existing methods of sampling indoor particulate matter (PM) to develop a suitable sampling strategy for a toxicological assay. During three sampling campaigns in moisture-damaged and non-damaged school buildings, we evaluated one passive and three active sampling methods: the Settled <b>Dust</b> <b>Box</b> (SDB), the Button Aerosol Sampler, the Harvard Impactor and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Bioaerosol Cyclone Sampler. Mouse RAW 264. 7 macrophages were exposed to particle suspensions and cell metabolic activity (CMA), production of nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF 1) were determined after 2422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 h of exposure. The repeatability of the toxicological analyses was very good for all tested sampler types. Variability within the schools was found to be high especially between different classrooms in the moisture-damaged school. Passively collected settled dust and PM collected actively with the NIOSH Sampler (Stage 1) caused a clear response in exposed cells. The results suggested the higher relative immunotoxicological activity of dust from the moisture-damaged school. The NIOSH Sampler is a promising candidate for the collection of size-fractionated PM to be used in toxicity testing. The applicability of such sampling strategy in grading moisture damage severity in buildings needs to be developed further in a larger cohort of buildings.

40|$|Recently, Papadopoulos et al., 2010 using sub-mm CO {{molecular}} line observations of nearby ultra-luminous IRAS galaxies, (U) LIRGs, {{have found that}} exceptionally large gas column densities (N_H > 10 ^ 25 cm- 2) can be present across {{some of the very}} dense gaseous disks that are typically found in these objects. They also proposed a diagnostic for finding such sources using CO and HCN {{molecular line}}s. Given that such high column densities are expected to absorb any X-ray luminous AGN, yielding Compton-thick sources, we set out toexplore whether this can be discerned using X-ray observations. More specifically we examine X-ray spectral observations of 14 sources in their sample, using public Chandra observations (0. 5 - 10 keV) for eleven sources as well as BeppoSAX results (2 - 100 keV) from the literature for another three sources. Our goal is to find candidate Compton-thick AGN and to check whether the molecular line selection criterion is successful in selecting such systems. X-ray spectroscopy reveals four candidate Compton-thick AGN of which half fall within the high obscuration region in the molecular line ratio diagnostics. Of the remaining five sources falling into the `high <b>dust</b> obscuration' <b>box,</b> one (Mrk 273) is highly obscured (N_H ~ 4 x 10 ^ 23 cm- 2) while in the other four the X-ray emission is most probably associated with star-forming processes rather than an AGN {{on the basis of their}} X-ray and mid-infrared properties. Overall, we argue that although this method as expected cannot recover all Compton-thick AGN, there are no examples of X-ray luminous AGN inside that region that have low obscuration, suggesting that this method is efficient in finding heavily obscured AGN in dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxies. The above results bear important implications for future joint ALMA and X-ray observations for the detection of Compton-thick AGN. Comment: To appear in A&A Letter...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Although {{they have}} many {{disadvantages}} for welfare, including for behavior, laying hen cages also have advantages. For example, aggression and cannibal-ism (or the need for beak trimming to prevent these) are usually less than in other systems, benefiting both {{the birds and the}} producer. There have been three ap-proaches to reducing other behavioral problems. First, the design of conventional cages has been improved, which has had favorable effects on some aspects of behavior, such as feeding. Second, cages for larger groups of birds have been tested; for example, the get-away cage has increased behavioral freedom but has also increased problems such as aggression and can-nibalism. Third, novel cages have been designed for conventional group sizes. Many of the behavioral problemsÐfor producers, birds, or bothÐoccurring in conventional cages can be reduced or prevented by increasing cage area (including width) and height and by providing a nest <b>box,</b> <b>dust</b> bath, and perch. Some of these modifications could be implemented at negligible cost to the producer.

I formulate a mechanistic model of iron cycling which includes scavenging onto sinking particles and complexation with an organic ligand. The iron cycle is coupled to a model of the phosphorus cycle. The aeolian source of iron is prescribed. This system is examined {{in the context of a}} highly idealized box model.

I implement this biogeochemical scheme in a coarse resolution ocean general circulation model, guided by the box model sensitivity studies. This model is also able to reproduce the broad regional patterns of iron and phosphorus. In particular, the high macro-nutrient concentrations of the Southern Oceans result from iron limitation in the model. I define a tracer, Fe* that quantifies the degree to which a water mass is iron limited. Surface waters in high nutrient, low chlorophyll regions have negative Fe* values, indicating Fe limitation, because aeolian surface dust flux is not sufficient to(cont.) compensate for the lack of iron in upwelled waters.

40|$|The {{etiology}} of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) in horses is closely {{connected with the}} amount of dust particles and mould spores in the air of horse barns. The chronic disease pattern is based on a permanent mechanical irritation and a hypersensitivity reaction of the respiratory tract resulting from long-term exposure to high aerosol concentrations. For the present dissertation, airborne dusts and moulds in two different horse barns of the Röttgen stud farm in Cologne/Germany were studied in detail. Apart from a quantitiative analysis of the aerosols, the main focus of the research was not only on qualitative analyses such as the identification of mould types and the measurement of particle size distributions, but also on the detection of potential dust and mould sources in the barns. Moreover, the acquired data were checked for possible correlations between dust particles and mould spores. In addition to the concentration development of dust particles, it was also possible to carry out long-term measurements of the concentration of mould spores in the air. This was made possible by using an eight-stage Andersen sampler and by a modification of the dust analysis carried out after sampling. Thus, it was possible to avoid the problem of individual stages being overloaded, which often occurs with six-stage Anderson samplers when germ concentrations are high and sampling takes place over longer periods of time. Moreover, the Anderson sampler was successfully used to analyse the size structure of moulds. By this method it was possible to obtain satisfactory and reproducible results. Due to the different day-to-day activities in horse barns, the concentration of dust particles is subject to great fluctuation. To accomplish a constant dust level, selective measurements were carried out at specific times of day. These investigations were complemented with tests using a <b>dust</b> releasing <b>box</b> developed at the Institute of Agricultural Engineering, which was used to simulate dust levels occurring during the feeding of horses with roughage. Both experimental setups were designed to produce homogenous concentrations of airborne dust and mould. The long-term measurements showed that the concentration of airborne particles in horse barns is subject to great diurnal fluctuation, which results in wide scattering of the obtained data. The biggest influences on the development of peak concentrations are the processes of mucking out and refilling the horse boxes with fresh straw as well as the handling of roughage. The analysis of the particle size distribution showed a predominance of fine particles in the barn air, especially of particles with a size of 0, 3 - 0, 4 µm. In addition to the human influence on dust development in the stable during working phases, dust concentrations are kept at a certain level by the constant resuspension of particles due to animal activity. The mould concentrations measured in the barns ranged from 3. 9 to 5. 9 x 105 CFU/m 3 air. The most common mould genera were Eurotium, Wallemia and Cladosporium. The latter two, which were found in batches of straw and hay, are very likely sources of mould in the barn air. By using an Andersen sampler it was possible to establish that spores are in a size range between 2. 1 and 4. 7 µm, which enables them to penetrate to the deep regions of the lungs. A statistical analysis of the relationship between dust particles and mould spores showed a high coefficient of determination only for similar aerosol concentrations and under standardized conditions. The data from the horse barns showed only weak correlations between these two parameters. It was not possible to make predictions about mould levels on the basis of long-term measurements of dust particles in the field studies. This would require additional measurements of airborne germs as well as an indirect detection method. On the basis of these investigations it was possible to isolate weak points in barn management and hygiene and to develop corrective measures to be taken in horse keeping...|$|R
