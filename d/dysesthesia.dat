50|$|Sensory {{symptoms}} of small fiber neuropathy are highly variable. Common complaints include paresthesias, <b>dysesthesias,</b> and insensitivity to pain. Paresthesias are abnormal sensations. They are {{often described as}} numbness, burning, cold, prickling, pins and needles along with other symptoms. <b>Dysesthesias</b> are unpleasant sensations, either spontaneous or evoked. A light breeze, the feeling of clothes, or even a soft touch can cause pain.Insensitivity to pain can be particular problem. One may be bleeding or have a skin injury without even knowing it.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dysesthesias</b> are disagreeable sensations {{produced}} by ordinary stimuli. The abnormal sensations {{are caused by}} lesions of the peripheral or central sensory pathways, and are described as painful feelings such as burning, wetness, itching, electric shock or pins and needles. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful <b>dysesthesias</b> usually respond well to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam or amitriptyline. A related symptom is a pleasant, yet unsettling sensation which has no normal explanation (such as sensation of gentle warmth arising from touch by clothing) ...|$|R
25|$|Tissue {{necrosis}} of the nipple-areola {{complex is}} the principal mastopexy medical complication. To prevent nipple-areola complex necrosis, the surgeon monitors and evaluates {{the viability of the}} transposed tissue; by the presence of oxygenated, bright red arterial blood demonstrates the proper functioning of the nipple-areola complex vascular system. A more common post-operative nipple-areola complex complication is <b>dysesthesia,</b> manifest as an abnormal sensation of numbness, and as a sensation of tingling, that perdures for the wound-healing period, yet it diminishes as the full functioning of the breast’s innervation resumes the full sensitivity to the nipple-areola complex; nonetheless, permanent numbness of the nipple-areola complex is rare.|$|E
25|$|RNA {{interference}} of BRAF {{stops the}} multiplication of melanoma tumor cells. This suggests that BRAF inhibitors such as sorafenib, PLX4720, PLX4032, GDC-0879, GSK2118436, or AZ628 may be affective in treating melanoma. These {{have been tested}} and proven {{to slow down the}} production of melanoma due to BRAF mutation but PLX4032 and GSK2118436 show the most promise because they worked the most aggressively in early stages of cell development. Although this drug helps slow down or shrink the tumors, there are many serious side affects to using these drugs that were found in the trials including arthralgia, rash, nausea, phosphosensitivity], fatigue, pruritus and palmo-plantar <b>dysesthesia.</b>|$|E
25|$|General medical {{complications}} of mastopexy include bleeding, infection, and the secondary {{effects of the}} anaesthesia. Specific complications include skin necrosis, and <b>dysesthesia,</b> abnormal changes in sensation (numbness and tingling). Serious medical complications include occurrences of seroma, a pocket of locally accumulated serous fluid, and occurrences of hematoma, a local accumulation of blood outside the vascular system. Necrosis of the nipple and necrosis of the skin flap (or both), when it occurs, can either be partial, and heal imperceptibly with wound care, or can be complete, and necessitate reconstruction. A complication of the Anchor mastopexy is the tension-caused wound breakdown at the junction of the three limbs of the incision, yet the scars usually heal without undergoing hypertrophy. Asymmetry of the bust is usually present pre-operatively, and the breast-lift surgery usually does not definitively eliminate it, regardless of the applied mastopexy technique or of the plastic surgeon’s operative expertise. Moreover, a combined mastopexy–breast augmentation procedure can make the surgical revision of breast asymmetry more difficult because of the overstretched tissues of nipple-areola complex. Moreover, a possible, undesirable outcome of the periareolar mastopexy (circumareolar incision) is the underprojection of the corrected breast from the chest wall.|$|E

5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or <b>dysesthesias.</b> Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is <b>dysesthesias.</b> Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful <b>dysesthesias</b> usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|R

2500|$|Neuropathic pain is pain {{caused by}} damage or disease {{affecting}} the somatosensory nervous system. Neuropathic pain {{may be associated}} with abnormal sensations called <b>dysesthesia</b> or pain from normally non-painful stimuli (allodynia).

Common qualities [...] include burning or coldness, [...] "pins and needles" [...] sensations, numbness and itching.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{sometimes}} the clinical findings do not correlate with the symptoms experienced. E.g., {{a person with}} signs of hyposalivation may not complain of xerostomia. Conversely a person who reports experiencing xerostomia may not show signs of reduced salivary secretions (subjective xerostomia). In the latter scenario, there are often other oral symptoms suggestive of oral <b>dysesthesia</b> ("burning mouth syndrome"). Some symptoms outside the mouth may occur together with xerostomia. These include: ...|$|E
2500|$|Radiotherapy {{may produce}} {{excessive}} {{growth of the}} fibrous tissue [...] (fibrosis) around the brachial or lumbosacral plexui (clusters of nerves), which can result in damage to the nerves over time (6 months to 20 years).

2500|$|Dejerine–Roussy {{syndrome}} or thalamic pain {{syndrome is}} a condition developed after a thalamic stroke, a stroke causing damage to the thalamus. Ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes can cause lesioning in the thalamus. The lesions, usually present in one hemisphere of the brain, most often cause an initial lack of sensation and tingling in {{the opposite side of}} the body. Weeks to months later, numbness can develop into severe and chronic pain that is not proportional to an environmental stimulus, called <b>dysesthesia</b> or allodynia. As initial stroke symptoms (numbness and tingling) dissipate, an imbalance in sensation causes these later syndromes, characterizing Dejerine–Roussy syndrome. Although some treatments exist, they are often expensive, chemically based, invasive, and only treat patients for some time before they need more treatment, called [...] "refractory treatment".|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Restless legs {{syndrome}} is a sensorimotor neurological disorder {{characterized by an}} urge to move the legs in response to uncomfortable leg sensations. While asleep, 70 to 90 percent of patients with restless legs syndrome have periodic limb movements in sleep. Frequent periodic limb movements in sleep and related brain arousals as documented by polysomnography are associated with poorer quality of sleep and daytime fatigue. Restless legs syndrome in middle age is sometimes associated with neuropathic foot <b>dysesthesias.</b> The causes of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements in sleep are unknown, but the sensorimotor symptoms are hypothesized to originate in the central nervous system. We have previously determined that bilateral forefoot digital nerve impingement masses (neuromas) may be a cause of both neuropathic foot <b>dysesthesias</b> and the leg restlessness of restless legs syndrome. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this case is the first report of bilateral foot neuromas as a cause of periodic limb movements in sleep. Case presentation A 42 -year-old Caucasian woman with severe restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements in sleep and bilateral neuropathic foot <b>dysesthesias</b> was diagnosed as having neuromas in the second, third, and fourth metatarsal head interspaces of both feet. The third interspace neuromas represented regrowth (or 'stump') neuromas that had developed since bilateral third interspace neuroma excision five years earlier. Because intensive conservative treatments including repeated neuroma injections and various restless legs syndrome medications had failed, radical surgery was recommended. All six neuromas were excised. Leg restlessness, foot <b>dysesthesias</b> and subjective sleep quality improved immediately. Assessment after 18 days showed an 84 to 100 percent reduction of visual analog scale scores for specific <b>dysesthesias</b> and marked reductions of pre-operative scores of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index, fatigue severity scale, and the international restless legs syndrome rating scale (36 to 4). Polysomnography six weeks post-operatively showed improved sleep efficiency, a marked increase in rapid eye movement sleep, and marked reductions in hourly rates of both periodic limb movements in sleep with arousal (135. 3 to 3. 3) and spontaneous arousals (17. 3 to 0). Conclusion The immediate and near complete remission of symptoms, the histopathology of the excised tissues, and the marked improvement in polysomnographic parameters documented six weeks after surgery together indicate that this patient's severe restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements in sleep was of peripheral nerve (foot neuroma) origin. Further study of foot neuromas as a source of periodic limb movements in sleep and as a cause of sleep dysfunction in patients with or without concomitant restless legs syndrome, is warranted. </p...|$|R
25|$|Painful <b>dysesthesias</b> {{caused by}} {{alcoholic}} polyneuropathy {{can be treated}} by using gabapentin or amitriptyline in combination with over-the-counter pain medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, or carbamazepine may help stabbing pains and have central and peripheral anticholinergic and sedative effects. These agents have central effects on pain transmission and block the active reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.|$|R

Acute neurotoxicty is typically characterized by distal and perioral cold-induced paresthesias and <b>dysesthesias,</b> but other uncommon symptoms might also be present. Our aim was to prospectively assess the incidence of uncommon acute OXA neurotoxicity symptoms in patients undergoing OXA-based chemotherapy. Patients and methods: One hundred chemotherapy-naïve patients (62 males, 38 females, aged 64. 7 ± 8. 7 years) with colorectal cancer scheduled to receive OXA-based therapy (FOLFOX- 4, FOLFOX- 6, XELOX) underwent neurological evaluation after the 1 st infusion and then after 3 and 6 months of OXA-based chemotherapy (after 6 th or 4 th and 12 th or 8 th cycles respectively, according to regimen).

Apnea is a potential complication. Substances that may cause this toxidrome include anticonvulsants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid, Methaqualone, and ethanol. While most sedative-hypnotics are anticonvulsant, some such as GHB and methaqualone instead lower the seizure threshold, and so can cause paradoxical seizures in overdose.|$|R
