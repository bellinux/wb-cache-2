5|$|As {{in much of}} the UK, Leeds' {{housing stock}} had <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> {{disrepair}} {{by the middle of the}} 20th century. The city was overcrowded, and the Victorian terraces were unsuitable for modern inhabitation. Leeds had one of the most Labour orientated councils and in the 1930s pledged to replace 30,000 slums.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, the Sounds {{started the}} year in first-place, where they {{remained}} for only ten days.

5|$|Loch Leven Castle had <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> ruin by the 18th century, but {{the ruins}} were conserved and rubbish removed in 1840.

5|$|St Mary's Church, Rhodogeidio {{is a small}} medieval church, {{dating from}} the 15th century, near Llannerch-y-medd, in Anglesey, north Wales. It served as a chapel of ease to another church in the area, St Ceidio's.

5|$|The {{area and}} the {{surrounding}} chase were subject to forest law, as a Royal forest. In the early period, this would have meant harsh punishments for residents that poached livestock or encroached on other Royal entitlements. By Tudor times, royal lands had become used as commons and forest law had <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> disuse.|$|E
5|$|Although much of Hornung's {{work has}} <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> obscurity, his Raffles stories {{continued}} to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories dealt with {{a wider range of}} themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, class and the unequal role played by women in society. Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E
5|$|An unusual slapstick mix of film noir, black {{comedy and}} B-movie conventions, the film portrays bizarre {{situations}} involving a death row inmate. The film was a box-office flop, {{and has since}} <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> obscurity outside of fans of Campbell and Raimi. Few critics reviewed the film, though the little amount of critical attention it received was mostly negative. Several elements of the film influenced later productions by Raimi, {{and the failure of}} Crimewave directly led to the inception of Evil Dead II (1987). The film has achieved the status of a minor cult film.|$|E

5|$|Bristol sent three {{ships to}} the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also {{supplied}} two levies {{of men to}} the defending land forces. Despite appeals to the Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had to repair the walls and gates of the city. The castle had <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> disuse in the late Tudor era, but the City authorities {{had no control over}} royal property and the precincts became a refuge for lawbreakers.|$|E
5|$|By 1846, {{the station}} was already very busy, {{handling}} trains from Wigan and the south, Bolton, Fleetwood, Blackpool, Lancaster and the north, and Blackburn. There were no footbridges; passengers had to cross the lines escorted by station staff. North of {{the station was}} a network of goods lines {{around the end of}} the Lancaster Canal. The coal yards and sidings here continued to operate long after the canal had <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> commercial disuse.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s {{these had}} <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> disuse, and the locks were {{dismantled}} in 1933.

The British Waterways Board (BWB) came into existence on 1 January 1963, the day the Forth and Clyde Canal was closed, with the objective of finding a broad strategy for the future of canals in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|By {{the reign}} of George I, the May Fair had <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> disrepute and was {{regarded}} as a public scandal. The 6th Earl of Coventry, who lived on Piccadilly, considered the fair to be a nuisance and led a public campaign against it along with local residents. It was abolished in 1764. One of the reasons for Mayfair's subsequent boom in property development was to keep out lower class activities.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Townshend had <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> depression, {{wondering}} if {{he was no longer}} a visionary. He was again at odds with Daltrey and Entwistle, who merely wanted to tour and play hits and thought Townshend had saved his best songs for his solo album, Empty Glass (1980). Jones' drumming style was very different from Moon's and this drew criticism within the band. Townshend briefly became addicted to heroin before cleaning up early in 1982 after treatment with Meg Patterson.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the fortifications had <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> {{disrepair}} {{because the}} Swedish command {{did not pay}} much attention to these territories, and funds that were allotted for renovation were insignificant. In addition, the forts at Nöteborg and Nyenskans were considered sufficient to provide defense for the region. In 1702, however, some repairs were completed under the supervision of Captain L. Stobecks.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the mosque}} began under the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in either 1634 or 1635, and was {{completed}} in approximately seven years.

The British scholar Fred Henry Andrews noted in 1903 that the mosque had <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> disrepair.|$|E
5|$|Despite such inaccuracies, {{the tale}} has been {{frequently}} repeated. Individual privileges that did exist have <b>fallen</b> <b>into</b> disuse—for example the Lord of the Manor of Worksop (which {{is not a}} peerage) was extended the privilege and duty of attending the coronation of the British monarch until 1937, but the right was not exercised at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 as the manor was under corporate ownership at the time.|$|E
5|$|During the ice ages of {{the last}} two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the {{expanded}} polar ice cap several times.
