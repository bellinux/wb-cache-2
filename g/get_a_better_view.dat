Despite the well-known alcohol abuse-related risks (e. g. traffic accidents, violence, injuries), drinking, and even occasional heavy drinking, is perceived by young people as having social and coping benefits (Shulenberg & Maggs, 2002). Recognizing how drinking fits into young people lives may help professionals to design and implement more effective preventive interventions. The present research aims at <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> of drinking motives, social and contextual factors that may promote alcohol abuse. Grounded Theory has been the methodological and analytical framework. A pilot focus group oriented the following sampling.

More interviews has been planned. Transcripts of the interviews are being analyzed through NVivo 9. 0 software. Alcohol seems to be intentionally used to reach different outcomes in different settings (e. g. disinhibition in clubs). Coherently with the literature affiliation and socialization are, in general, the main drinking motives, while the motive “enjoy the taste of alcohol”, related to moderate drinking, seems to be specific to our Italian sample...|$|R

This Master's Thesis examines if AR can be used to help maintenance engineers set up and maintain robot environments by visualizing robot movement and safety zones. The main result of the Master's Thesis is a prototype application for a tablet computer. The user points the tablet towards a robot filming it and the video feed is displayed on the screen. This video feed is augmented with a virtual zone displayed around the robot, illustratingthe area where the robot is allowed to move. The application fetches the coordinatesfor the zone from the safety system SafeMove { a system designed by ABB to increase safetyand allow closer human-robot collaboration. The visualization of a SafeMove conguration is currently limited to an image of atwo-dimensional coordinate system showing the zone as a set of dierent coordinates.

40|$|Abstract Background This article {{presents}} a study, which examines {{the effects of}} biphasic electrical shocks on human ventricular tissue. The effects {{of this type of}} shock are not yet fully understood. Animal experiments showed the superiority of biphasic shocks over monophasic ones in defibrillation. A mathematical computer simulation can increase the knowledge of human heart behavior. Methods The research presented in this article was done with different models representing a three-dimensional wedge of ventricular myocardium. The electrophysiology was described with Priebe-Beuckelmann model. The realistic fiber twist, which is specific to human myocardium was included. Planar electrodes were placed at the ends of the longest side of the virtual cardiac wedge, in a bath medium. They were sources of electrical shocks, which varied in magnitude from 0. 1 to 5 V. In a second arrangement ring electrodes were placed directly on myocardium for <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> on secondary electrical sources. The electrical reaction of the tissue was generated with a bidomain model. Results The reaction of the tissue to the electrical shock was specific to the initial imposed characteristics. Depolarization appeared in the first 5 ms in different locations. A further study of the cardiac tissue behavior revealed, which features influence the response of the considered muscle. It was shown that the time needed by the tissue to be totally depolarized is much shorter when a biphasic shock is applied. Each simulation ended only after complete repolarization was achieved. This created the possibility of gathering information from all states corresponding to one cycle of the cardiac rhythm. Conclusions The differences between the reaction of the homogeneous tissue and a tissue, which contains cleavage planes, reveals important aspects of superiority of biphasic pulses.

500|$|Springbok {{often go}} into bouts of {{repeated}} high leaps {{of up to}} [...] into the air – a practice known as pronking (derived from the Afrikaans pronk, [...] "to show off") or stotting. In pronking, the springbok performs multiple leaps into the air in a stiff-legged posture, with the back bowed and the white flap lifted. When the male shows off his strength to attract a mate, or to ward off predators, he starts off in a stiff-legged trot, leaping into the air with an arched back every few paces and lifting the flap along his back. Lifting the flap causes the long white hairs under the tail to stand up in a conspicuous fan shape, which in turn emits a strong scent of sweat. Although the exact cause of this behaviour is unknown, springbok exhibit this activity when they are nervous or otherwise excited. The most accepted theory for pronking {{is that it is}} a method to raise alarm against a potential predator or confuse it, or to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> of a concealed predator; it may also be used for display. Springbok are very fast antelopes, clocked at [...] They generally tend to be ignored by carnivores unless they are breeding.

40|$|Thesis (M. Phil.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{ideal of}} {{artificial}} intelligence can firstly be set {{as the ability}} of a mechanical (or electronic) agent to be able to, as a human, observe, reason, learn, communicate and act in complex environments and secondly, to explain this type of behaviour in humans, animals or any other type of agent. The aim of this study is firstly to determine whether this ideal is feasible and secondly, to look at the physicalist premise thereof, viz., everything is physical according to Dooyeweerd’s view of the creation, fall and redemption motive. First we determine the essence of artificial intelligence through the Curch–Turing thesis. We then place the essence of artificial intelligence alongside the essence of life firstly to see whether the construction of an artificial intelligence agent is possible and whether the subject artificial intelligence has something to say regarding intelligent behaviour in humans, animals and similar agents. Lastly we look at the physicalist premise of artificial intelligence viz., everything is physical from the reformative creation, fall and redemption motive. The Church–Turing thesis forms the boundary of what is feasible in artificial intelligence and what is not feasible. Every component of the thesis is limited to the arithmetic law sphere of Being, i. e. the succession of discrete elements in a set of elements. Any effort to reduce the spatial aspect of the being to the arithmetic aspect of Being, like the enumeration of irrational numbers, ends in an antinomy. Any artificial intelligence agent is in its nature limited to the arithmetic law sphere of Being. The structural intertwinement, which such an artificial intelligence agent has with its underlying physical components is, in contrast with living organisms that of an irreversible grounded enkapsis. Life and mind has, in contrast to the arithmetic seclusion of an artificial intelligence agent, a fullness and totality. It has an ability to unlock Being in its fullness, which comes to the fore in a way that any living organism unlocks the plastic horizon of Being in the respective internal and phenomenological horizons. The unlocking of the spatial aspect plays a key role with its kernel of totality, simultaneity and continuousness. In both these horizons, the organism is in a living enkapsis with both its underlying physical substrate and the physical things in its external surroundings. The ideal of artificial intelligence is thus a phantasm. The only comment it can give on biology is that which {{has to do with the}} succession of discrete elements in a system. Hempel’s dilemma and the halting problem expose the physicalist point of departure of everything is physical as a religious premise, which is not empirically verifiable. Instead of <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> of Being the contours of meaning of life as well as all the supra physical aspects of Being fades away or is denied with concealment of Being.

500|$|The Dutch fleet was watched {{constantly}} by {{the ships}} Duncan had sent to observe them, and when Dutch preparations to sail were observed a message {{was sent back}} to Duncan informing him of the Dutch movements. The despatch vessel flew the signal for an enemy as it entered Yarmouth roads early in the morning on 9 October, so that by the time it had docked the British fleet was already preparing to sail, Duncan sending the final message to the Admiralty: [...] "The wind is now in the NE and [...] shall make good course over to them, and if it please God, hope to get at them. The squadron under my command are unmoored and I shall put to sea immediately." [...] Before midday, Duncan had sailed with the 11 ships that were ready and steered for the mouth of the Texel, intending to intercept De Winter on his return. By evening his fleet was at full strength, three stragglers having rejoined, and on the afternoon of 10 October his ships were anchored off the Dutch port, scouts reporting 22 merchant ships in the harbour but no sign of De Winter's warships. Since leaving the Texel, De Winter had been unable to escape from Trollope's ships: on the evening of 10 October, several Dutch vessels were detached to drive his squadron away while the Dutch fleet lay off the Maas, but could not close with the faster British vessels. Having failed to make the rendezvous off the Maas, De Winter then turned to the northwest, cruising off Lowestoft in Suffolk and again unsuccessfully attempting to drive away Trollope's squadron. There, reports from Dutch fishing vessels of Duncan's appearance off the Texel reached De Winter and he immediately recalled his ships and ordered the fleet to turn back towards the Dutch coast, aiming for the village of Scheveningen. Meanwhile, further messages from Trollope reporting the Dutch movements had reached Duncan and he turned his fleet west, following the Dutch coastline. At 07:00 on the morning of 11 October Trollope's squadron sighted sails to the northeast and, after confirming that they were Duncan's fleet, signalled that the Dutch fleet was approximately [...] further to the southwest, becoming visible to the fleet by 08:30. The first clear sighting was reported by Captain Peter Halkett of Circe, who had climbed the mainmast to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view.</b> At this point, the Dutch were sailing towards land, approximately [...] off the coast of Noord-Holland, close to the village of Camperduin. The weather was poor, with heavy seas and strong wind from the southeast broken by frequent rain squalls, but this did not prevent hundreds of Dutch civilians gathering on the dunes to watch the impending combat.|$|E

40|$|Some {{cohesive}} soils show very little resistance {{when it comes}} to interaction with relatively pure water, however the water flow itself does not have to necessarily cause any damage in the soil structure. These soils are so poorly bonded, that this small amount of water flow can lead to structural breakdown. The effect caused several dike and earth dam damages and failures in the past years, therefore the behavior itself is considered as a geotechnical risk in the process of design. The dike breaches lead to the emergence of knowing how to identify and locate the areas and soil types, where the hazardous soils occur. In geotechnical engineering these soils are referred as dispersive soils, and their properties are known since the 1960 s. In the recent years researches were carried out to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> point of <b>view</b> of the reasons of these kind of behavior. Therefore the investigation of physical and chemical properties were made. The results showed that the dispersive behavior can be connected with the amount of dissolved salts in the soil extract. Since these are known as the origin of sodic soils, the relationship was investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{industry}} of mining and metal production {{has always been}} in conflict with environmental issues. A problem of major concern is the contamination of freshwater around sulphide-bearing mine waste deposits. In northern Sweden many mine wastes originate from sulphide ores and thus generate acid drainage (AMD). The object of this study, Rävlidmyran pit lake, is an abandoned sulphide mine {{owned and operated by}} Boliden Mineral AB between 1951 and 1991. The aim {{of this study is to}} getter <b>a</b> <b>better</b> understanding of the aquatic system at Rävlidmyran. This is done by calculating a metal balance for the pit lake, determining the trace metal transport into the recipient Lake Hornträsket and reviewing how the water quality changes in the surface streams draining the area. Rävlidmyran pit lake is a meromictic flow-through water body with no surface inlets or outlets. Downstream of the pit lake, a waste rock dump acts as an embankment. The pit lake partially drains via seepage through the embankment and the outflowing water shows the characteristics of acid mine drainage (i. e. low pH and high levels of trace metals). Field data (pH, conductivity and temperature) were sampled at Rävlidmyran on a weekly basis from four groundwater pipes, five surface stream stations and from the surface water of the pit lake. Water samples were analyzed for total concentrations of Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb and Zn once a month. Additional sampling was performed for this thesis in September and October 2010, when field data was measured at six locations downstream of the pit lake and a profile was measured in the water column of the pit lake (at the deepest point). The metal balance is calculated assuming steady state regarding the pit lake water balance. Inflowing fluxes of water used in the mass balance are: deep groundwater, shallow groundwater and precipitation. Outflowing fluxes are: groundwater and seepage through the embankment. Metal concentrations for the inflowing and outflowing water fluxes are mainly taken from the sampling data provided by Boliden Mineral AB. For the inflowing deep groundwater no data exist, so concentrations have been estimated from the bottom water of the pit lake. The mass balance is calculated per month for a period of one year between November 2009 and October 2010. Data does not exist for the full year, so two cases of the metal mass balance have been calculated, one with estimated maximum concentrations and one with estimated minimum concentrations. The metal transport to Lake Hornträsket is calculated by multiplying concentration data with measured water flow in the two surface streams draining the mine site. Results from the mass balance suggest that the pit lake continuously accumulates As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn. For Mn and Ni there appears to be a net export from the pit lake. The largest uncertainties in the mass balance calculations are the metal concentrations for the inflowing deep groundwater. The importance of this parameter was judged by calculating a hypothetical deep groundwater concentration corresponding to a zero mass balance. The result from the zero-balance can be used as guideline values for concentrations of trace metals in the inflowing deep groundwater. It is recommended to install a deep groundwater well in the upstream area and compare measured deep groundwater concentrations with the calculated concentrations from the zero-balance. To further improve the mass balance sampling should continue until a one-year cycle is measured in all points. To install a permanent sampling station to measure concentrations and water flow for the seepage to the north is also considered to be a good approach for improving the credibility of the mass balance. From the vertical profiles of conductivity, temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen saturation measured in the pit lake in October 2010, a permanent stratification with a steep chemical gradient between 7 and 8 meters depth can clearly be observed. The conductivity in the monimolimnion during 2010 was higher than for earlier profile measurements from 2001 to 2004. This observation supports the result from the mass balance, suggesting that metals are continuously accumulating in the pit lake. It is suggested that this observation is followed up by measuring new depth profiles at regular intervals. The largest annual metal fluxes into Lake Hornträsket are observed for Zn (1300 kg), Mn (930 kg) and Fe (380 kg). The impact Rävlidmyran has on Lake Hornträsket is difficult to judge from these figures. One possible approach for <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>view</b> is to compare the calculated metal transport from Rävlidmyran with the metal transport from the nearby Hornträskviken mine. Another way of assessing the influence from Rävlidmyran is to directly observe the measured concentrations in the two outlets and compare them with local background values. The concentrations of Ba, Cd, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn are clearly elevated in the surface water streams that enter Lake Hornträsket. The only element that is measured to be higher in the reference point is As. It is possible that the station measuring local background values is influenced by mining activities and thus not representative as a reference point. To clarify this it is suggested that samples for metal analysis are collected further upstream from the reference point, and possibly also from other natural surface streams in the area. It should then be evaluated if the reference point needs to be relocated. Validerat; 20110220 (anonymous...|$|R
