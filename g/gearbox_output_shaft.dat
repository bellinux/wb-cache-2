25|$|An {{improvement}} in form {{came at the}} Italian Grand Prix where the cars ran without wings and Goodyear brought their new G9 specification tyre. McLaren qualified on the front row and led to begin with until he slowed {{at the scene of}} an accident and was caught by Stewart, Hulme and Jo Siffert in a Lotus. A slipstreaming battle ensued; McLaren retired with an oil leak at mid-distance but Hulme went on to win. From the Canadian Grand Prix onwards, a third M7A was driven by Dan Gurney whose Anglo American Racers team – for whom Bruce McLaren had driven for three races in 1967 – had run out of funding for their own Eagle cars. Gurney retired with overheating in Canada, but Hulme and McLaren continued their success by finishing first and second respectively, albeit after their strongest challengers had all retired. Hulme was then jointly in the lead of the drivers' championship with two races to go. He ran competitively towards the beginning of the United States Grand Prix but ultimately retired via a spin, pit stops to repair damaged brake lines and a <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> failure which spun him again, this time into a crash. McLaren was sixth, Gurney fourth. Going into the final race in Mexico, Hulme retained a chance of defending his title. McLaren finished second there, but Hulme crashed out because of a broken suspension damper allowing Hill to win the drivers' championship.|$|E

5000|$|The engine gave {{maximum power}} at 7,500 rpm (the rotors turning at only 2,500rpm), but a 2.96:1 {{reduction}} gearbox (closely {{based on that}} in the Hewland AE75 engine) gave a maximum propeller rotation of an efficient 2,500 rpm. [...] Unlike the Hewland's <b>gearbox,</b> where the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> and propellor flange was below the crankshaft, the MidWest's <b>gearbox</b> had its <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> higher than the eccentric shaft.

40|$|Research was {{performed}} {{to determine if a}} diagnostic tool for detecting fatigue damage of helicopter tapered roller bearings can be used to determine remaining useful life (RUL). The taper roller bearings under study were installed on the tail <b>gearbox</b> (TGB) <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> of UH- 60 M helicopters, removed from the helicopters and subsequently installed in a bearing spall propagation test rig. The diagnostic tool was developed and evaluated experimentally by collecting oil debris data during spall progression tests on four bearings. During each test, data from an on-line, in-line, inductance type oil debris sensor was monitored and recorded for the occurrence of pitting damage. Results from the four bearings tested indicate that measuring the debris generated when a bearing outer race begins to spall can be used to indicate bearing damage progression and remaining bearing life...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{design of the}} device for testing the {{localization}} techniques for indoor navigation. Autonomous robot was designed as the most appropriate platform for testing. The thesis {{is divided into three}} parts. The first one describes various kinds of robots, their possible use and sensors, which could be of use for solving the problem. The second part deals with the design and construction of the robot. The robot is built on the chassis of the differential type with support spur. Two electric motors with a <b>gearbox</b> and <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> speed sensor represent the drive unit. Coat of the robot was designed for good functionality and attractive overall look.

50|$|The Hatsukaze Model 12 was {{the power}} section {{linked to a}} {{compressor}} to create a primitive jet engine called a motorjet; the resulting Tsu-11 was intended to power Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka Model 22 flying bombs. The standard Hatsukaze 11 engine was modified at a Navy arsenal by replacing the propeller drive shaft and engine front crankcase cover with a step-up gearbox. The <b>gearbox</b> increased engine <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> RPM at a 1:3 ratio. At engine speed of 3,000 RPM, the compressor section was operating at 9,000 RPM. The compressed air was then ducted into a combustion chamber where a liquid fuel was sprayed. The heated compressed air then exits through the tailpipe providing static thrust of 180 kg (396 lb). It is likely that about 1/3 of the total thrust was contributed by adding the combustion chamber aft of the compressor.|$|R

50|$|It is a three-axis design, with first, second, fifth, {{and sixth}} gears on an <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> behind {{and below the}} input shaft, and third and fourth gears are on an <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> in front of and above the input <b>shaft.</b> Both <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> pinions drive a helical gear with a {{conventional}} differential.

50|$|In {{many modern}} designs, the engine {{sits in front}} of the gearbox. From a {{sprocket}} {{on one side of the}} crankshaft, a chain or sprocket directly mounted to the clutch will drive the clutch, which can often be found behind a large circular cover on one side of the gearbox. The clutch is connected to the gearbox input shaft. For motorcycles with chain drive, the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> is typically connected to the sprocket which drives the final drive chain.|$|E
50|$|The system {{features}} an oil pressure operated device {{attached to the}} back of the standard gearbox operating on the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> Through a system of oil pressure, solenoids and pistons, the overdrive would drop the revs on whatever gears it was used on by 22% (.778). For instance, the overdrive system applied to a Triumph TR5 operates on 2nd, 3rd and top gear. When engaged, the overdrive would drop the revs from 3000 by 666 RPM, or from 3500 the drop would be 777 RPM to 2723 net. The advantages this reduced rpm had on fuel consumption was most often quite near 22% decrease during highway driving.|$|E

50|$|Many Powerglides {{share the}} same length, 27 spline <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> and {{transmission}} mounting as the THM 350; thus, the transmissions are easily interchangeable for owners wanting three speeds instead of two.

5000|$|With {{the early}} {{development}} {{of cars and}} the almost universal rear-wheel drive layout, the final drive (i.e. rear axle) ratio for fast cars was chosen to give the ratio for maximum speed. The gearbox was designed so that, for efficiency, the fastest ratio would be a [...] "direct-drive" [...] or [...] "straight-through" [...] 1:1 ratio, avoiding frictional losses in the gears. Achieving an overdriven ratio for cruising thus required a gearbox ratio even higher than this, i.e. the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> rotating faster than the engine. The propeller shaft linking gearbox and rear axle is thus overdriven, and a transmission capable of doing this became termed an [...] "overdrive" [...] transmission.|$|E
50|$|Fitted with {{coil spring}} {{suspension}} and drum brakes, the AML lacks hydraulic assist on either brakes or steering; only front wheels steer. Consequently, {{the steering wheel}} requires considerable strength to turn while the vehicle is in motion - while stationary it remains effectively locked. Much like the Ferret, rear wheel drive is transmitted directly to epicyclic hub reduction gears, also known as bevel boxes. The motor and gearbox have been harnessed via a centrifugal clutch with electromagnetic control, {{eliminating the need for}} a clutch pedal. This type of clutch is automatically engaged by gripping the knob of the gearshift lever, which is located behind the driver's seat in the hull floor. The gearbox assembly consists of two separate gearboxes, one for high and the other for low gear. The low-range gearbox is designed for off-road use and has a reverse gear and a top gear, while the high-range box is for operation on roads and has three low gears and one overdrive. There is a hydraulic dual-circuit handbrake operating on the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Lancia's {{permanent}} four-wheel-drive {{system was}} based on three differentials.An epicyclic gear train served as centre differential, splitting the torque between {{the front and rear}} axle according to a fixed predetermined ratio—56% front&#x2009;/&#x2009;44% rear on the Prisma 4WD. The ring gear of the epicyclic differential meshed with the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> its sun gear transmitted torque the front open differential, and its planet carrier, through a pair of bevel gears and a three-piece drive shaft, to the rear differential. A Ferguson coupling controlled the centre differential, preventing excessive relative slippage of the two axles. The epicyclic differential, the Ferguson coupling and the front differential were mounted coaxially in a single transverse unit just behind the engine.In place of the complex Torsen rear differential of the Delta HF 4WD, the Prisma 4WD had a simpler [...] "open" [...] type one, with differential lock—useful at low speeds in low grip conditions—controlled by the driver via a switch on the dashboard. This difference reflected the different goals of the two systems and the destination of the two vehicles: the Delta HF was designed for sport driving, the Prisma for all-conditions safe driving.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{crown wheel}} {{interfaces}} to the respective <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> directly, whilst the spider carrier interfaces to each <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> using a clutch pack {{which gives the}} unit {{the ability to control}} torque distribution over and above the static torque distribution.|$|R
50|$|The AW4 is {{also used}} behind the 2.5 L (150 CID) AMC Straight-4 engine. It has a {{removable}} bell housing with a mount for the crankshaft position sensor. Early AW4s used 21-spline <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> In 1991 the AW4 was changed to a 23-spline <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> concurrent with adoption of the High Output (commonly known as H.O.) inline six-cylinder engine. Some sources state that the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> spline change occurred for the 1990 model year. The change most likely occurred during the 1990 model run with early 1990 models receiving 21-spline transmission and later models receiving 23-spline. If swapping transmissions in 1990 model year vehicles either swap the transfer case as well or make sure to check spline count. The input on the transfer case can also be changed to match the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> spline count. Rear-wheel-drive-only transmissions {{all have the same}} spline count on the <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> only 4x4 models are affected by differing spline count.|$|R

5000|$|Yamaha {{launched}} the YZF-R1 after redesigning the Genesis engine {{to create a}} more compact engine by raising the gearbox input shaft and allowing the <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> to be placed beneath it. This design feature was revolutionary, called a 'stacked gearbox', it has set a precedent for other manufacturers to follow. This [...] "compacting" [...] of the engine made the total engine length much shorter overall, thereby, allowing the wheelbase of the motorcycle to be shortened significantly. This, in turn, allowed the frame design to place the weight of the engine in the frame to aid handling because of an optimized center of gravity. The swingarm was able to be made longer without compromising the overall wheelbase, which was a short 1385mm. Four Kehin CV carburetors of 40mm diameter fed fuel to the engine, 140 bhp was claimed by the factory, at the countershaft. USD 41mm front forks supplied by KYB mounted 300mm semi-floating disk brakes. The instrument panel was electrical with, self diagnosis system inbuilt, and digital speed readout. The exhaust system utilised an EXUP valve, which controlled the exhaust gas flow, to maximise engine power production at all revs, creating a high powered but also torquey engine. The twin headlights were powerful. The Yamaha YZF-R6 was introduced in 1999 as the 600 cc version of the R1 super bike.|$|E

40|$|Research to {{correlate}} bearing {{remaining useful life}} (RUL) predictions with Helicopter Health Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) condition indicators (CI) to indicate the damage state of a transmission component has been developed. Condition indicators were monitored and recorded on UH- 60 M (Black Hawk) tail <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> thrust bearings, which {{had been removed from}} helicopters and installed in a bearing spall propagation test rig. Condition indicators monitoring the tail <b>gearbox</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> thrust bearings in UH- 60 M helicopters were also recorded from an on-board HUMS. The spal-lpropagation data collected in the test rig was used to generate condition indicators for bearing fault detection. A damage progression model was also developed from this data. Determining the RUL of this component in a helicopter requires the CI response to be mapped to the damage state. The data from helicopters and a test rig were analyzed to determine if bearing remaining useful life predictions could be correlated with HUMS condition indicators (CI). Results indicate data fusion analysis techniques can be used to map the CI response to the damage levels...|$|E
50|$|The PT6D-114A {{is based}} on the PT6A-114A.

50|$|Likewise, {{the size}} of an idler wheel in a non-geared {{friction}} drive system does not affect the gear ratio between the input and <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> The surface speed of the input shaft is transferred directly to the surface speed of the idler wheel, and then from the idler wheel to the <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> A larger or smaller idler wheel maintains the same surface speed (which equals the surface speed of the input <b>shaft),</b> therefore the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> is driven at a constant speed regardless of {{the size of}} the idler wheel.|$|R
