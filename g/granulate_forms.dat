Most studies have shown that scorias are economically sound and ecologically friendly building materials (Vlček et al. 2014). Scoria, as lightweight aggregate, has been used in concrete to produce structural lightweight concrete, especially in Turkey (Yaşar et al. 2004). However, most of these works have not included the simultaneous research on the mechanical, thermal, and acoustic characteristics of the building materials incorporating scorias.|$|E

40|$|Glass ionomer cement (Ionocem) was {{developed}} foruse in bone surgery and {{is reported to}} be notably biocompatible. Between 1991 and 1994 we performed revision operations for aseptic loosening of arthroplasties of the hip on 45 patients using this material in its <b>granulate</b> <b>form</b> (Ionogran) mixed with homologous bone as a bone substitute. Of these 45 patients, 42 were followed up for a mean of 42 months. Early reloosening of the acetabular component has occurred in ten after a mean of 30 months. Histological examination showed large deposits of aluminium in the adjacent connective tissue and bone. Osteoblastic function and bone mineralisation were clearly inhibited. The serum levels of aluminium were also increased. The toxic damage at the bone interface caused by high local levels of aluminium must be seen as an important factor in the high rate of early reloosening. Our findings cast doubt on the biocompatibility of this material and we do not recommend continuation of its further use in orthopaedic surgery...|$|R

40|$|In the {{following}} clinical study an investigation {{was made into}} the effect of two synthetic bone grafts based on ß-tricalcium phosphate (ß-TCP) with a similar chemical composition but of a different particle morphology on neoosteogenesis, osteogenetic cell activity and volume stability. Purpose {{of the study was}} to determine if on the basis of structural differences of ß-TCP and supplementation of fermented hyaluronan the material properties of ß-TCP can be optimized with respect to their volume stability and bone regeneration. The two different biomaterials were randomized in a paired comparison i. e. split-mouth-design and used on seven patients with bilateral sinus elevation. In one maxillary sinus a standard ß-TCP in <b>granulate</b> <b>form</b> (TCP) was inserted and in the other a differently structured ß-TCP Putty enriched with fermented hyaluronan (TCP-HyA). After six months of healing the bone biopsies were extracted during the implant preparation, so that the specimens could be analyzed histomorphometrically and immunohistochemically. The sinus graft volume was shown in dental CT´s that were taken pre- and postoperatively after sinuslift and after six months healing. The histomorphometric evaluation of all TCP specimens indicated on average a newly formed bone area of 17. 4 ± 8. 7 %, whereas in TCP-HyA specimens it was 30. 1 ± 8. 1 % (p = 0. 06). The average volume reduction of all TCP inserted areas reached 28. 4 ± 16. 1 %, whereas in TCP-HyA areas it was 14. 5 ± 10. 3 % (p = 0. 39). Both bone grafts can provide a sufficient bone supply for the dental implants especially in sinus augmentation. The volumetric, histomorphometric and immunohistochemical results indicate a clear tendency for higher volume stability and bone regeneration rate in favour of TCP-HyA. The results are without statistical significance. Further studies need to prove if these effects can be attributed to the altered granulate structure on the one hand or to the effect fermented hyaluronan on the other...|$|R
40|$|Disposal {{of waste}} cooking oils becomes {{a problem in}} the {{developed}} countries because the limited options to dispose them and usually people will pour waste cooking oil down to the drain or sewers which contribute to clog and unpleasant odour. Thus, in this research, vegetable waste palm oil is used as a raw material in order to create foam and further processed into <b>granulate</b> <b>form</b> which is powder that are compressed using hot compression moulding technique. The fabricated samples produced after hot compress were represented as waste bio-polymer (WB) and later on, these WB were irradiated with ultra violet-irradiation (UV-irradiated) and the samples become UV-irradiated WB. WB and UV-irradiated WB samples with three different thickness/laminated structure with minimum thickness of 5. 4 mm, three layer thicknesses of 10. 8 mm and four layer thicknesses of 16. 2 mm. These samples were examined by means of vibration transmissibility test and other physical tests. Vibration transmissibility test was operated at 1 mm and 1. 5 mm for displacement transmissibility, 0. 1 g and 0. 15 g for acceleration transmissibility base excitation whereas the physical and mechanical properties were studied through compression test, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and density test. The morphological studies were observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM). UV-irradiation does not give influence towards WB in terms of damping ratio since it gives the most excellent vibration damping of 0. 707. WB sample looks like needle, sharp, fibrous, coarse structure which can be seen at 0, 250 and 500 hour UV-irradiation WB but when the time exposure of UV is increasing, the surface morphology of the sample becomes blunter and the texture is much flatter. However, the overall structure has no major difference from 0 hour to 1000 hour UV-irradiation indicates that this UV-irradiated WB has high photo-stability. From the density test, the results indicated that WB (0 hour UV) is denser than UV-irradiated WB (1000 hour UV) which is 1025. 73 kg/m 3 and 914. 87 kg/m 3 respectively. The result of glass transition, Tg values for WB and UV-irradiated WB were decreased from 48. 66 ˚C to 48. 31 ˚C as the time of exposure of UV increases. As a conclusion, this WB and UV-irradiated WB are useful as a new material product which has been recycled to become bio-polymer generated from waste cooking oil; this product have good quality to survive in robust environmental condition in terms of UV radiation...|$|R
40|$|Selective laser {{sintering}} (SLS) is a powder based additive manufacturing method especially equipped to produce small batch sizes of products with customized properties. However, the limited raw material availability restricts {{the production of}} functional parts with SLS. The purpose of this master’s thesis is to investigate the usability of polyolefins, namely polypropylene and polyethylene, as possible materials {{to be used in}} the SLS. The theoretical part of this thesis includes basic information about selective {{laser sintering}} and its requirements. In addition, possible powder production methods are investigated including mechanical and physiochemical methods. Furthermore, some general information about polyolefins is discussed. The experimental part investigates injection moulding grade polypropylene and polyethylene as well as two different commercial polypropylene powders. The material properties of these polyolefins were investigated to determine their suitability {{to be used in the}} SLS. Grinding was employed to pulverize materials in <b>granulate</b> <b>form.</b> Furthermore, the flowability of the powders was evaluated with a SLS machine and tensile specimens were produced with the SLS for the tensile testing. In addition, the fracture surfaces of the tensile specimens were investigated with SEM to evaluate the sintering quality and porosity of the specimens. Thermal analysis showed that all the investigated polypropylenes had adequate thermal properties, however, the investigated polyethylene did not. Rheological properties were superior for the commercial polypropylene powders compared to the injection moulding grade. The commercial powders had a relatively spherical morphology and sufficient particle size. However, grinding did not lead to the desired extrinsic properties. The flowability evaluation showed that the grinded polypropylene could not be spread evenly enough to be able to use it in the SLS. However, both of the commercial powders showed promising flowability and the tensile specimens could be manufactured with one of the commercial powders. The tensile specimens were produced with the different energy density levels to determine the optimal value for the specific material. According to the tensile tests, increasing the energy density level increases the tensile strength. However, all the SLS specimens showed very brittle behavior and quite low tensile stress at break. The sintering quality evaluation with SEM showed that the powder particles were not completely coalescence and the individual powder particles could be seen quite clearly in the structure. Using higher energy density levels could lead to lower porosity and better tensile properties...|$|R

40|$|The Holarctic diving beetle genus Graphoderus (Dytiscinae, Aciliini) {{contains}} {{relatively few}} and well-known species but these {{may still be}} difficult to identify based on external characters. A taxonomic problem in the eastern Palearctic was discovered that relates to the Palearctic G. zonatus (Hoppe, 1795) and the Nearctic G. perplexus Sharp, 1882. Based on qualitative and quantitative characters, especially on male genitalia which have been poorly studied in the past, it is shown that eastern Palearctic specimens identified by previous authors as {{either of the two}} species in fact belongs to a third species. The synonymized name G. elatus Sharp, 1882, is reinstated as a valid species (stat. n.) and a lectotype is designated from the mixed syntype series. The male genitalia of all known Graphoderus species have been examined and an illustrated identification key to the genus is provided. The three species in the complex of focus, G. elatus, G. zonatus and G. perplexus are found to have allopatric distributions; G. perplexus in the Nearctic region, G. zonatus in the west Palearctic region and eastwards to the Yenisei-Angara river and G. elatus east of the Yenisei-Angara river. All previous records of either G. zonatus or G. perplexus in the east Palearctic, east of the Yenisei-Angara river turned out to be misidentified G. elatus. This conclusion also brings with it that dimorphic females, thought only to be present in the single subspecies G. zonatus verrucifer (CR Sahlberg, 1824), proved to be present also in a second species, G. elatus. The dimorphic female forms is either with dorsally smooth elytra and pronotum or conspicuously granulated elytra and wrinkly pronotum.
