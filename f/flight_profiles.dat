5|$|The Bolo plan {{reasoned}} that by equipping F-4s with jamming pods, using the call signs and communications codewords of the F-105 wings, and flying their <b>flight</b> <b>profiles</b> through northwest Vietnam, the F-4s could effectively simulate an F-105 bombing mission and entice the MiG-21s into intercepting not bomb-laden Thunderchiefs, but Phantoms configured for air-to-air combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{switch from}} high-altitude to low-altitude <b>flight</b> <b>profiles</b> {{severely}} affected the B-70, whose design was highly tuned {{to provide the}} desired high-altitude performance. Planners outlined a series of low-level profiles for the B-70, but higher aerodynamic drag at low level limited the B-70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range. The result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed than the B-52, but less range. Unsuited for the new low-altitude role, and because of a growing shift to the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was cancelled in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, and the two XB-70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program.|$|E

A gradual controlled release was accomplished during the first six inches of vertical motion.|$|E
