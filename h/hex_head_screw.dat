50|$|CSG {{manufacturing}} of NY {{also created}} 8 additional China Lake reproduction launcher receivers, serial numbered 1 through 8. The CSG China Lake launchers have additional manufacturing to increase {{reliability of the}} China Lake Grenade Launcher cycling of action. CSG also replaced most flat <b>headed</b> <b>screws</b> to <b>hex</b> <b>headed</b> <b>screws,</b> the butt stock recoil pads are solid instead of the ventilated on the CSG launchers, no sling studs or swivels were installed initially on the CSG launchers. Manufacturing Metals were upgraded with hardness treatment and improved metallurgy since the original China Lake with both the Airtronic/Trident and CSG receivers and parts. Total number of privately owned China Lake launchers accounted for inside the United States is 16.|$|R

Hallowell, Sr, working independently, introduced {{commercially viable}} <b>hex</b> socket <b>head</b> set <b>screws,</b> and Hallowell patented a shaft collar with this safety-style set screw. His safety set collar {{was soon copied}} by others and became an industry standard. The invention of the safety set collar {{was the beginning of}} the recessed-socket screw industry.|$|R
5000|$|Screw-in insert nuts have an {{external}} thread and <b>hex</b> <b>head</b> and are <b>screwed</b> {{in with a}} Flat Blade Screwdriver or an Allen wrench. The screw-in insert nuts come in various sizes and take different screw sizes. For example, a [...] "1/4-20" [...] insert nut will take a 1/4-20 inch bolt. The pre-drilled hole must be as deep as {{the length of the}} insert nut plus any portion of the bolt that may be screwed past the end of the nut in the work piece.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hex</b> socket <b>screw</b> <b>heads</b> {{are usually}} made by {{stamping}} {{the head with}} a die, plastically deforming the metal. Other ways to generate the hex socket include linear broaching and rotary broaching. Broaching the heads with a linear broach is essentially the metalworking analog of mortising wood with a mortising machine; a hole is drilled and then the corners are broached out. This operation often leaves little telltale curled chips still attached {{at the bottom of the}} socket. These are negligible for most applications.|$|R
50|$|They {{are almost}} always {{provided}} with a #2 Phillips drive. Sometimes a Torx drive is used instead. Both Phillips and Torx patterns may also be combined with a slot for a flat-blade screwdriver. Usually they are provided with a 1/4 in (0.25 in) flanged <b>hex</b> <b>head.</b> Non-standard metricized 5.5 mm flanged <b>hex</b> <b>heads</b> can also be encountered. Also common are pan <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> - a low disk with a chamfered outer edge. Because they are used in places where high torque is not required and easy removal and replacement may be desirable (such as on the side panels of the PC case), they are frequently available as thumbscrews with larger, knurled heads that can be removed with one's fingers or tools.|$|R

50|$|By design, Torx <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> resist cam-out {{better than}} Phillips head or slot <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> Whereas Phillips <b>heads</b> were {{allegedly}} designed {{to cause the}} driver to cam out, to prevent overtightening, Torx heads were designed to prevent cam-out. The development of better torque-limiting automatic screwdrivers for use in factories allowed this change. Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, <b>screw</b> <b>head,</b> and/or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.|$|R

5000|$|For the Torx type of design, {{the angle}} is {{much closer to}} 90º than {{in the case of}} the <b>hex</b> <b>head,</b> and so for a given torque the {{potentially}} damaging radial force is much lower.

50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the <b>head</b> of the <b>screw.</b> The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the <b>screw</b> <b>head.</b> This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, {{automated}} manufacturing insertion tools can now precisely sense fastener torque.

40|$|Introduction: There {{are limited}} {{information}} and inconclusive results for dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nails for trochanteric fractures. Therefore, {{we performed a}} prospective study to evaluate the healing of fractures, and survival, function, and complications of patients operated with this implant. 				 					Methods: We prospectively studied 79 patients (61 women and 18 men; mean age: 84. 7  years; range: 65 – 96  years) with a low-energy trochanteric fracture, treated with a dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nail from 2013 to 2016. The mean follow-up was 2. 1  years (range: 1 – 3  years); seven patients were lost to follow up. This left 72 patients for further analysis. We evaluated the healing of fractures, and survival, function, and complications of patients. 				 					Results: Fracture healing was evident in 70 patients (97. 2 %) at 2 – 3 months postoperatively. One patient experienced cut-out and z-effect phenomenon of the <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> Another patient experienced a periprosthetic femoral diaphysis fracture at the distal tip of the nail. A third patient experienced an acute postoperative superficial skin infection that was treated successfully with wound dressing changes and a course of antibiotics. Sixteen patients (22. 2 %) deceased within 12  months postoperatively. In the remaining patients, the Harris Hip Score (HHS) at 12  months postoperatively was excellent in 16 (28. 6 %), good in 23 (41. 1 %), fair in 10 (17. 8 %), and poor in 7 patients (12. 5 %). The function declined after the patients’ fracture. Fair and poor results were related to age >  85  years, poor pre-fracture level of function, and AO/OTA- 31 -A 3 fracture types. 				 					Conclusion: The dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nail is associated with high healing and low complication rates for intertrochanteric fractures. The function of the patients is good or excellent in most cases; however, it declines, especially for those patients with age >  85  years, poor pre-fracture level of function, and AO/OTA- 31 -A 3 fracture types...|$|R
50|$|The {{hand tool}} {{used to drive}} in most screws is called a screwdriver. A power tool that does the same job is a power screwdriver; power drills may also be used with {{screw-driving}} attachments.

40|$|A locking {{fastener}} assembly comprising a fastener having a shaft (12) {{and a head}} (14 or 114) and first threads (16) for placing the shaft (12) in tension to clamp a part (18). A threaded washer (20) has second threads (22) for disposition between the head (14 or 114) and the part (18). A torsion spring (24) reacts between the head (14 or 114) and the washer (20) for urging the head (14 or 114) and the washer (20) to rotate in opposite directions. The assembly {{is characterized by the}} first and second threads (22) being of different pitches and in the same helical direction whereby the torsion spring (24) continually rotates the washer (20) to maintain a pre-load on the shaft (12).
