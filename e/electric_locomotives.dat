5|$|Cargolink has a {{fleet of}} five shunters at their port in Drammen, in {{addition}} to three Di6 diesel locomotives and three TRAXX <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> for main haulage. While the shunters are owned by Cargolink, the diesel locomotives are leased from Dispolok of Germany and the <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> are leased from Hector Rail. It also has more than 100closed autoracks for automobile transport, and 60container cars. 70new autoracks are under delivery from Sweden.|$|E
5|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{were first}} {{acquired}} with the electrification {{of the suburban}} railways, the E class suburban engines acquired in 1923 and 1928–29, followed by the L class from 1953 when the mainline to Traralgon was electrified for briquette traffic.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Caltrans {{released}} the first feasibility study detailing {{the possibility of}} electrifying the railroad between San Francisco and San Jose. The 1992 Feasibility Study proposed replacing the existing diesel-electric locomotives with either a fleet of EMD AEM-7 <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> to move the existing gallery passenger cars or Metro North Budd M-2/M-4 EMUs. The primary benefits of an electrified railway would be improvements in air quality, noise, and acceleration, but would also save on other ancillary costs, such as lubricating oil, cooling water, maintenance, and refueling. Because of the relatively close spacing between stops, the improved acceleration using <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> compared to the existing diesel-electric locomotives would cut transit time between San Francisco and San Jose by up to twelve minutes, and using EMUs would cut the time over the same distance by up to 23 minutes, assuming the use of ten-car trainsets. The 1992 Feasibility Study recommended the use of <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> and 25kV AC overhead lines as the most cost-effective alternative, since the gallery cars, which had been built in 1985, were then relatively new and could be reused.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> EP1 is a Russian <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{which has}} been {{produced}} by Novocherkassk <b>Electric</b> <b>Locomotive</b> Plant since 1998. It is the first Russian passenger <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> with the 2o-2o-2o or Bo-Bo-Bo axle arrangement. There are, as December 2016, 866 of these locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|In 1998, Datong <b>Electric</b> <b>Locomotive</b> Works and Zhuzhou <b>Electric</b> <b>Locomotive</b> Research Institute, Chengdu Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works {{developed}} SS7C <b>Electric</b> <b>Locomotive.</b> There were 171 SS7Cs manufactured.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there would be}} a {{continuing}} need for fast freight locomotives, capable of operating on both electrified and non-electrified routes, without impeding the intensive use of the system by passenger trains. Suburban electrification used electric multiple units, which had no equivalent freight design. Although Bulleid built two prototype <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> in 1941, these were, as yet, unproven, and freight haulage would be undertaken by steam traction for the foreseeable future.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the line}} started in 1907, and it opened two years later. It became the second Norwegian railway to be {{electrified}} in 1911. It experienced heavy growth, and had fifteen <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> in use. During World War II it {{was the scene of}} the Norwegian heavy water sabotage. After the 1960s production declined, and the railway was closed in 1991. It was kept as a heritage railway.|$|E
5|$|The Leader {{project was}} part of Bulleid's desire to modernise the steam {{locomotive}} based on experience gained with the Southern Railway's fleet of electric stock. Bulleid considered that attitudes towards the labour-intensity of steam operation had changed during the post-war period, favouring dieselisation and electrification. In an effort to demonstrate the continued potential of steam, Bulleid pushed forward the boundaries of steam-power, allowing it to compete with diesel and <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> in terms of labour-saving and ease of operation.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, Datong <b>Electric</b> <b>Locomotive</b> Works and Zhuzhou <b>Electric</b> <b>Locomotive</b> Research Institute, Chengdu Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works {{developed}} SS7D <b>Electric</b> <b>Locomotive.</b> There were 59 SS7Ds manufactured, and {{belong to}} Xi'an Locomotive Depot, Xi'an Railway Bureau.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, Zhuzhou <b>Electric</b> <b>Locomotive</b> Works {{produced}} SS4G(Chinese: 韶4改). SS4G {{are very}} similar to standard SS4, apart from an improved electrical technology.

5|$|Amtrak ordered 150 more Amfleet {{cars from}} Budd on March 13, 1980, {{at a cost}} of $150 million. These cars, dubbed Amfleet II, were {{intended}} to replace rolling stock on Amtrak long-distance trains, and featured larger windows, more legroom, and folding legrests. Budd delivered the first four cars on October 28, 1981; the unveiling took place on November 11. The final cars arrived on June 11, 1983. The Amfleet IIs were the last intercity cars Budd built. The continuing unreliability of the Budd Metroliner led to refurbished Amfleet I coaches displacing them in Metroliner service in 1981. New EMD AEM-7 <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> pulled the trains.|$|E
5|$|Departmental {{locomotives}} on the London Underground {{consist of}} vehicles {{of a number}} of types which are used for engineering purposes. These include battery locomotives, diesel locomotives, <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives,</b> sleet locomotives, pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars. Details of the first four types are covered elsewhere. Pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service, but continue to be used by the engineering department. Pilot motor cars are used to move other vehicles around the system, while ballast motor cars are used to haul ballast trains and engineering trains.|$|E
5|$|From 1913 former S {{lines were}} {{electrified}} with 1,500Vdc overhead lines and <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> hauled coal trains between Shildon and Erimus marshalling yard, which had opened in 1908 between Middlesbrough and Thornaby. The trains took the former S line from Shildon to Simpasture Junction, joining the former Clarence Railway line to Carlton, where a later line allowed {{access to the}} Stockton to Middlesbrough extension. The locomotives operated for 20 years, but then coal traffic had reduced, which made it uneconomical to maintain the electrification system.|$|E

5|$|NSB El 18 is a {{class of}} 22 <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> built by Adtranz and Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM) for the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). The class is a {{modification}} of the Swiss Federal Railways Re 460 locomotive and built at Adtranz Strømmen in 1996 and 1997. The class remains the only mainline electric locomotive used by NSB, and is predominantly used on some intercity services and all night trains on the Bergen Line, Dovre Line and Sørland Line, {{as well as some}} regional trains.|$|E
5|$|NSB El 9 is {{a retired}} class of three <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> built by Thune for the Norwegian State Railways (NSB), with {{electrical}} equipment from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB) and Per Kure. The locomotives were delivered in 1947 after a three-year delay caused by wartime sabotage {{in response to the}} German occupation of Norway. They were used nearly exclusively on the Flåm Line and Hardanger Line, two steep branch lines. The units were used on the Flåm Line until 1983, when they were replaced by El 11. They were then used as shunters until being retired in 1988. Two of the locomotives have been preserved.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, 1977, Amtrak {{announced}} plans to spend $24.4 million to overhaul all 61 cars {{as part of a}} larger fleet renewal program. In early 1977, some cars were repainted in Amtrak's Phase I paint scheme with red, white and blue ends and a small Amtrak logo. On September 28, the Amtrak board approved a more limited overhaul program of 16 Metroliners, as well as the purchase of the first 8 AEM-7 <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives.</b> On November 7, Amtrak released a specification for overhauling the 57 unmodified cars. It awarded a $20 million overhaul contract to GE that month.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the Hardanger Line used Class 64 {{electric}} multiple units. On 28 March 1940, NSB sent {{an invitation}} to tender for two multiple units which {{would be similar to}} Class 64. The company asked both for aluminum and steel bids. However, NSB abandoned the plans and instead signed an agreement on 4 October 1940 for delivery of three <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives.</b> The units were intended to be delivered in 1942. The mechanical components and assembly was done by Thune, and electrical parts were delivered by NEBB, except the transformer and electric controllers, which were built by Per Kure.|$|E
5|$|The B's use of {{electrification}} {{instead of}} steam {{power in a}} Baltimore tunnel on the Royal Blue Line, beginning in 1895, marked the first use of <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> by an American railroad and presaged the dawn of practical alternatives to steam power in the 20th century. Spurred by intense competition from the formidable Pennsylvania Railroad, the dominant railroad in the lucrative New YorkWashington market since the 1880s, the Royal Blue in its mid-1930s reincarnation was noted {{for a number of}} technological innovations, including streamlining and the first non-articulated diesel locomotive on a passenger train in the U.S., a harbinger of the steam locomotive's eventual demise.|$|E
5|$|The E60s were {{successful}} in the coal-hauling role. They ran on the BM for decades and remain in use on several mining railroads in the Western United States. The passenger variants failed in their intended role. Problems with the truck design caused derailments above , rendering the locomotives unusable for high-speed service. By {{the end of the}} 1970s Amtrak abandoned the E60 in favor of EMD AEM-7 locomotives manufactured by Electro-Motive Division. In Mexico, the NdeM's project was delayed into the 1990s, then scrapped after three years of use. Most of the NdeM's <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> never ran and were traded back to GE for diesels. Some were sold to various mining railroads.|$|E

5|$|By now the pre-war {{electrification}} scheme {{had been}} revived. In 1957 electrification between Rickmansworth and Amersham and Chesham began. Chalfont& Latimer's platforms were extended {{and a second}} platform was opened at Chesham on 3 July 1960 to prevent through operations to and from Baker Street from interfering with the Chesham–Chalfont& Latimer shuttle. An electric service using London Underground T Stock began operations between Chesham and Chalfont& Latimer on 16 August 1960, with former MR <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> hauling the through trains to and from London. A steam locomotive was kept on standby in the new second platform at Chesham, {{in case of a}} failure of the electric trains. From June 1962 both the T Stock and the locomotive-hauled trains were replaced by the newly introduced London Underground A Stock.|$|E
5|$|Dieselisation {{occurred}} from 1951 {{with the}} F class shunter, but the B and S classes of 1952 and 1957 revolutionised main line operations. They were then {{followed by the}} T and Y classes in 1955 and 1963 which displaced steam from the branch lines and yards. Apart from the F class, Clyde Engineering has had a monopoly on Victorian diesel-electric locos. as the Australian licensee of General Motors EMD engines and traction motors, fitting them into locally designed bodies. By the 1980s the first generation locomotives were approaching {{the end of their}} lives, with the <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> withdrawn by 1988, and the modern N and G classes allowing the withdrawal of lower power T and Y classes.|$|E
