25|$|One {{problem for}} the early twenty-first century {{is the fact that}} the organic {{component}} of any <b>deposited</b> <b>material</b> is readily destroyed by heat, such as occurs when a gun is fired or a bomb is detonated, when the temperature may reach as high as 500°C. Encouragingly, however, the non-volatile inorganic component of eccrine secretion has been shown to remain intact even when exposed to temperatures as high as 600°C.|$|E
25|$|Both {{of these}} {{processes}} are effective for a limited duration; the jetting method is ineffective {{as soon as the}} next leaf falls; the sand deposition method is more durable, although rainfall usually removes the deposited sand quickly. Another method is using a high voltage electrical spark or plasma to volatilize the <b>deposited</b> <b>material,</b> but this method has only been used experimentally, as it is hindered by high power consumption, noise and rail degradation.|$|E
25|$|Density {{contrasts}} {{can also}} cause small-scale faulting, even while sedimentation progresses (synchronous-sedimentary faulting). Such faulting can also occur when large masses of non-lithified sediment are deposited on a slope, such as at the front side of a delta or the continental slope. Instabilities in such sediments can result in the <b>deposited</b> <b>material</b> to slump, producing fissures and folding. The resulting structures in the rock are syn-sedimentary folds and faults, which {{can be difficult to}} distinguish from folds and faults formed by tectonic forces acting on lithified rocks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{systematic}} experiments {{for cutting}} remanufacture <b>deposited</b> <b>materials</b> have been finished. The {{results show that}} the <b>deposited</b> <b>materials</b> can be divided into two parts on the view of machining process:surface layer and dense layer. One of the distinctive features on surface layer is impacts to cutting tools in the process. And the process of dense layer cutting is similar with homogeneous material. On the basis of above, the paper puts forward the method which adopts different processing phases for <b>deposited</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

25|$|The town {{formerly}} had excellent beaches, {{which were}} supplied by longshore drift constantly moving sand {{along the coast}} from west to east. However, in the early 20th century a large breakwater was constructed at Newhaven Harbour and the harbour entrance was regularly dredged. These works cut off the supply of fresh sand to the beach. By the 1980s the beach at Seaford had all but vanished, the shoreline becoming steep, narrow and largely composed of small boulders. This made Seaford attractive to watersports enthusiasts (since water visibility was good {{and there was a}} rapid drop-off into deep water) but it discouraged more general seaside visitors. So in 1987 a massive beach replenishment operation was carried out, in which around 1 million tonnes of material was dredged from sandbanks out to sea and deposited on the shore. During a severe storm in October of the same year a substantial amount of the <b>deposited</b> <b>material</b> on {{the upper part of the}} beach was washed out past low tide level, leading to questions in the House of Commons. The beach has been topped up several times since then, giving the town a broad beach of sand and shingle.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} form of {{pancreatic}} cancer (adenocarcinoma) is typically characterized by moderately to poorly differentiated glandular structures on microscopic examination. There is typically considerable desmoplasia or formation of a dense fibrous stroma or structural tissue consisting of a range of cell types (including myofibroblasts, macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells) and <b>deposited</b> <b>material</b> (such as type I collagen and hyaluronic acid). [...] This creates a tumor microenvironment that is short of blood vessels (hypovascular) and so of oxygen (tumor hypoxia). [...] It is thought that this prevents many chemotherapy drugs from reaching the tumor, as one factor making the cancer especially hard to treat.|$|E
500|$|Joppenbergh Mountain is {{a nearly}} [...] {{mountain}} in Rosendale Village, a hamlet {{in the town}} of Rosendale, in Ulster County, New York. The mountain is composed of a carbonate bedrock overlain by glacially <b>deposited</b> <b>material.</b> It was named after Rosendale's founder, Jacob Rutsen, and mined throughout the late 19thcentury for dolostone that was used in the manufacture of natural cement. Extensive mining caused a large cave-in on December 19, 1899, that destroyed equipment and collapsed shafts within Joppenbergh. Though it was feared that several workers had been killed, the collapse happened while all the miners were outside, eating lunch. Since the collapse, the mountain has experienced shaking and periodic rockfalls.|$|E

2500|$|The trench was dredged {{primarily}} {{by a series}} of specialised vessels, in several stages and with different equipment. [...] Much of the main trench for the Lee Tunnel was excavated by the backhoe dredger [...] "Zenne". Two barges were used to transport the dredged material 19km (12mi) downriver and from there to a disposal site four miles offshore. The cutter dredger [...] "Vlaanderen XIX" [...] removed the underlying fluvioglacial material. A second cutter dredger, [...] "Vlaanderen XV", was deployed to breach the casting basin perimeter, or [...] "bund". [...] A rock layer was encountered on part of the trench line, which was dealt with by the jack-up platform [...] "Zeebouwer". The [...] "Big Boss" [...] vessel was employed to remove the rock. This backhoe dredger was equipped with a [...] "Backhoover" [...] (in effect, a [...] "mini" [...] precision dredger).

40|$|In {{the iron}} ore pelletizing, the {{sintering}} of the pellets {{takes place in}} a rotary kiln which is lined with refractory bricks. During the process, <b>deposited</b> <b>materials</b> such as iron ore slag, additives, binders and fly ash stick {{on the surface of the}} lining, and with time, by infiltration and diffusion, a corroded layer is formed. Some of the reactions occurred in that layer are promoted by the presence of alkalis. Refractory/deposited materials reactions and infiltration of <b>deposited</b> <b>materials</b> were studied at laboratory scale. In this study, techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), x-ray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used. Reaction temperatures, phase transformations and infiltration depth of <b>deposited</b> <b>materials</b> were determinated. Additions of alkalis into the materials involved were used to enhance the reactions between them. Using powder mixtures the results of DSC show that in addition of K 2 CO 3 the reaction temperature range is 850 - 950 °C showing formation of new phases around 850 °C with kalsilite and around 950 °C with leucite; in addition of the mixture Na 2 CO 3 and K 2 CO 3, there is a broader temperature interval of 600 - 925 °C with formation of kalsilite at lower temperatures and nepheline at higher temperatures. In the characterization of the infiltration of <b>deposited</b> <b>materials</b> into the brick it was observed that nepheline was formed mainly in the corroded brick layer but K feldespathoids (leucite, kalsilite, kaliophilite) were formed beneath the corroded brick layer.
