[...] Chinese history professor Jonathan Lipman from Mount Holyoke College expressed the dilemma of accepting CI funding thus: [...] "By peddling a product we want, namely Chinese language study, the Confucius Institutes bring the Chinese government into the American academy in powerful ways. The general pattern is very clear. They can say, 'We'll give you this money, you'll have a Chinese program, and nobody will talk about Tibet.' In this economy, turning them down has real costs." [...] Professor Terry Russell at the University of Manitoba questioned the Hanban's real motivation, fearing the university {{would not be able}} to organize certain activities judged [...] "sensitive" [...] to the Chinese, such as bringing the Dalai Lama onto campus. He said, [...] "'We have a real conflict of our principles of academic freedom,' with the potential to have a faculty version of Chinese history and a Confucius Institute version being taught on campus."

2500|$|Days {{after the}} Nye video was posted, the YEC {{ministry}} Answers in Genesis (AiG) posted a video response featuring AiG scientists David Menton and Georgia Purdom.

AiG agreed to pay Nye's travel expenses, and the date [...] February 4, 2014 [...] was close to one of Nye's previously-scheduled speaking engagements at Kentucky's Murray State University.
