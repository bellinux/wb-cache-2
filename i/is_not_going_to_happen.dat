2500|$|In August 2010, a Microsoft spokesman, Tom Hanrahan of Microsoft's Open Source Technology Centre, stated, in {{reference}} to the lawsuit filed by Oracle against Google over Android's use of Java, that [...] "The type of action Oracle is taking against Google over Java <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> If a [...]NET port to Android was through Mono it would fall under the Microsoft Community Promise Agreement." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 17, 2011, Stargate {{writer and}} {{executive}} producer Brad Wright announced that the SGU movie <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> He also confirmed that the proposed Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis movies have been permanently shelved, along with another movie idea he {{had been trying to}} get a greenlight on that would have involved cast members of all three series. Still, Wright did not rule out future Stargate films, saying; [...] "It's a franchise. Stargate is not over. Somebody smart from MGM is going to figure it out, and something will happen." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2010, Cameron {{stated that}} the film was [...] "still on [...] radar", but he didn't know when he would make it. However, that October, he {{confirmed}} that his next films would be two Avatar sequels instead of Battle Angel. He still stated {{that he did not}} intend to abandon the film, stating that he loved the project too much to hand it off to another director, but reiterated in June 2011 {{that it would not be}} produced until the two Avatar sequels were completed, stating that [...] "...Battle Angel <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> for a few years." [...] According to Cameron, his reason for producing Avatar first is because he believes that the film can raise public awareness of the need for environmental protection.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is no use {{getting into}} a fuss about it, mother," [...] Jack said cheerfully; [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> again, you know.

5000|$|Again {{something}} {{written before}} Tommy {{had actually been}} formed as a total idea, and that particular song wasn't about Tommy's devotees at all. It was about the rabble in general, how we, myself as part of them, <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take fascism, <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take dreary, dying politics; <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take {{things the way they}} were, the way they always had been and that we were keen to change things."

6000|$|Why {{should she}} give her {{allegiance}} to this world, {{and let it}} so dominate her, that her own world of warm sun and growing, sap-filled life was turned into nothing? She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it. She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a prisoner in the dry, tyrannical man-world. She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> care about it. What did it matter if her class did ever so badly in the quarterly examination. Let it--what did it matter? ...|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, the Reimullers {{discover}} that {{their health insurance}} is invalid and their treatment is transferred from private to county hospital. In an attempt to pay the medical bills, Dave takes on more dangerous truck loads and works long hours.

6000|$|... "Don't be afraid," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ask you any questions. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ask for any explanations. I {{think that}} we have passed all that. It is of the future I wanted to speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Of course not,' said I, {{a little}} irritated--he has such queer ways of taking what I say. 'I mean I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die before you do. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> leave {{you in this}} world {{to take care of}} yourself.' ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{military}} assessments {{say this}} is a generational commitment. I will tell you this whole 18 months of drawing down troops <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> The military assessments are very clear: In order to stabilize Afghanistan, you essentially have to rebuild it. You can't accomplish that in 18 months, five years, or in a decade, and you'll be lucky to accomplish that in 20 years. Gen. McChrystal told me he will know in 18 months if this will work.

50|$|One {{possible}} reconstruction is as follows: For Diodorus, if {{a future}} event <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> {{then it was}} true {{in the past that}} it would not happen. Since every past truth is necessary (proposition 1), it was necessary that in the past it would not happen. Since the impossible cannot follow from the possible (proposition 2), it must have always been impossible for the event to occur. Therefore if something will not be true, it will never be possible for it to be true, and thus proposition 3 is shown to be false.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{give any}} examples.

5000|$|The last British colonial {{governor}} Chris Patten opposes Hong Kong independence, worrying such activists would [...] "dilute support" [...] {{for democracy}} in Hong Kong: [...] "it would be dishonest, dishonourable and reckless of somebody like me, to pretend that the case for democracy should be mixed up with an argument about the independence of Hong Kong - something which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> something which dilutes support for democracy, and something {{which has led to}} all sorts of antics which should not take place in a mature society aiming to be a full democracy." ...|$|E

5000|$|I can't believe it, {{it was so}} close. It {{feels like}} a pain in my heart.

It was after the restart after the final safety car that Kimi had a problem under braking and crashed into the back of my car. The race was over and it was a real shock. A few tears came out as the adrenaline was high - I just can't explain it.|$|E

5000|$|... 'Prayer {{does not}} mean that {{whatever}} is prayed for will necessarily be granted, for if this be the meaning of acceptance of prayer, two difficulties would arise: First, thousands of prayers are offered with great humility and in extreme anguish, and yet the wish is not granted. This means that the prayer has not been accepted despite the fact that God has promised the acceptance of prayers.The second difficulty is that whatever is going to happen has already been determined; likewise that which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> has also been determined, and nothing can ever happen contrary to this determination.|$|E

"It is a {{bit like}} taking out a pretty big {{mortgage}} in the expectation your income is going to rise, but the NHS is facing a period where that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Money is being squeezed {{and the size of the}} repayments will make it harder for some to make the savings it needs to. I don't see why the NHS can't go back to its lenders to renegotiate the deals, just as we would with our own mortgages." [...] Officials at the Treasury have also admitted that they may have to attempt to renegotiate certain PFI contracts in order to reduce payments, although it is far from certain that the private investors would accept this.|$|E
5000|$|During the [...] "Brand New Day" [...] storyline, {{where all}} {{knowledge}} of Peter Parkers marriage to Mary Jane has been erased by Mephisto and Spider-Mans secret identity has somehow {{been removed from}} the minds of everyone in the world, Jameson suffers a heart attack brought on by arguing with Peter Parker, and the Bugle is bought by Dexter Bennett, who turns it into a scandalous, muck-raking rag. Robbie, though disapproving, decides to stay, hoping Bennet will get better. He soon realizes that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> particularly after learning the DB was indirectly {{responsible for the death of}} several people shown on their paper from one of their scandals and resigns. Robertson becomes the editor for Ben Urichs newspaper, Front Line.|$|E
