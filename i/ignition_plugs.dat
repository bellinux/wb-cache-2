40|$|Pulsed {{detonation}} {{engines are}} {{slated to be}} the engines of the future promising better efficiencies and high Mach number applications. There are presently many centers of experimental PDE studies around the world. Most of the studies involve single shot and very short duration test runs. This paper looks {{at some of the}} issues faced by engineers studying PDEs, including issues that prevent longer duration testing, and offers some solutions that were developed during several years of PDE study. Some of the concerns investigated include the possibility of damage to the combustion chamber, auxiliary components, diagnostic devices, valves, <b>ignition</b> <b>plugs</b> and DDT enhancing devices, such as Shchelkin spirals, due to the innate extreme conditions of high heat and pressures found in PDEs. Viable solutions are offered that may help overcome these difficulties. Commercial solenoid valves and electronic fuel injectors are presented as the means to achieving higher operational frequencies. In addition, their modularity, low costs and their ability for precision digital control are clear advantages over heavier, more complex rotary or mechanical valving systems. Issues concerning data acquisition, such as proper implementing procedures for pressure transducers and choosing the appropriate sampling rates are discussed. A common concern during the data acquisition is the management of large amounts of data. Some simple and cost effective answers are proposed, such as implementing RAID for computing. EMI is a big concern for engineers in PDE studies because the instruments and devices used in the laboratories are sources of noise. Several solutions are pointed out to mitigate the effects of noise on the signals. Noise control should be looked at proactively during the design stage of the experimental set up because failing to do so can mean retroactive and sometimes costly modifications to experimental setup. Finally, some steps to improve safety during PDE studies are presented. Nomenclatur...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} {{three-way}} catalyst in motor vehicles has entailed a radical increase {{in the importance of}} misfire detection. In the case of a misfire, unburned fuel accesses the exhaust system, where its combustion in catalyst causes a dangerous increase of temperature, which may result in damage to the catalyst due to its thermal overload. Moreover, it may also lead to an increased emission of toxic substances. Therefore, misfire in an internal combustion engine must be detected, as specified in the On-Board Diagnostics II (OBDII) regulations beginning from 1996 model year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (E. P. A.). Misfire detection constitutes an essential ingredient of OBDII. Its implementation entails the use of sophisticated measurement methods and the processing of the measured signals. Misfires tend to be related to a faulty ignition system, (Defective <b>ignition</b> <b>plugs,</b> leaking secondary insulation, damaged ignition control module or high voltage wires). Yet there is still a wide spectrum of other possible causes of misfire, not connected with the spark generation circuit. Misfire may rise, for example; due to the leaky intake manifold, mechanisms damage to the engine, EGR system valve damage, inappropriate air-fuel ratio, Exhaust restrictions, damaged crankcase ventilation system (PVC), damaged injector, damaged intake or outlet valves or their improper control timing. If misfire occurs with such high frequency that the excessive quantity of unburned fuel accessing the catalyst threatens to damage it, the blinking malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) will make the driver aware of the extent of the damage of the engine. Many strategies of misfire detection have been developed, including variation in engine shaft angular speed, spark plug voltage, cylinder pressure, oxygen sensor signal, knowledge based expert system, and neural networks. WE propose a new method to use the real time signals of conventional oxygen sensor (EGO) and wide band oxygen sensor (UEGO) to detect misfire. In this paper, misfire was induced on purpose with a misfire generator. The sensors and the misfire trigger signals were recorded simultaneously. In this paper, we suggested a misfire detection method which used the fluctuation of an EGO and an UEGO sensors output signals caused by a misfire. The fluctuation in oxygen concentration in an exhaust manifold was estimated by recording the conventional oxygen sensor signal and the wide band oxygen sensor signal. It was found that the differentiated sensors’ signals give the criteria for misfire detection. The misfire can be detected by monitoring the amplitude of the fluctuation in the differentiated signals. The differentiated signals of UEGO and EGO sensors can be used for misfire detection in a single cylinder motorcycle engine at any operating conditions. The proposed misfire detection method had showed a reliability up to 98 % for UEGO and 90 % for EGO sensors at different engine operating conditions such as: engine speed from idle (2000 rpm) to 5000 rpm, engine loads 20 %TPS to 60 % TPS, and Air-fuel ratio varying from lean to rich.

40|$|Laser {{ignition}} {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} most promising future ignition concepts for internal combustion engines. It not only combines requirement of reduction of pollutant emissions but also improves engine efficiencies. In general, a well-defined ignition location and ignition time is of great importance for an IC engine. Spark plugs are well suited for such tasks but suffer from disadvantages, like erosion of electrodes & inflexible or un-optimal location of spark plug. Also the conventional ignition system cannot burn leaner air fuel mixture properly. In order to overcome the disadvantages of conventional ignition system, laser ignition system is researched upon. Laser ignition system gives the advantages like-it will reduce the NOx emission by 20 %,it will be able to give improved efficiencies. Also the Thermodynamic requirements of a high compression ratio and a high power density are fulfilled well by laser ignition system.. This paper outlines progress made in recent research on laser ignited IC engines, discusses the potential advantages and control opportunities and considers the challenges faced, construction and working of laser ignitor and the system requirements for laser ignitor. The igniting plasma is generated by a focussed pulsed laser beam. In order to generate the laser Nd:YAG is chosen as laser active medium emitting at λem = 1064 nm, and Cr:YAG as passive saturable absorber. There are four different ways in which laser light can interact with a combustible mixture to initiate an ignition event namely- 1. Thermal initiation, 2. Non resonant breakdown, 3. Resonant breakdown, and 4. Photochemical ignition. Out of the above stated different ways non resonant breakdown is more frequently used because of its freedom in selecting the laser wavelength and ease of implementation.

The goal was to demonstrate the feasibility of an ignition system life of 10, 000 hours and a system cost of less than 50 % of the glow plug system, while meeting or exceeding the engine thermal efficiency obtained with the glow plug system. There were three tasks in Phase 1. Under Task 1, a comprehensive review of feasible ignition options for DING engines was completed. The most promising options are: (1) AC and the ''SmartFire'' spark, which are both long-duration, low-power (LDLP) spark systems; (2) the short-duration, high-power (SDHP) spark system; (3) the micropilot injection ignition; and (4) the stratified charge plasma ignition. Efforts concentrated on investigating the AC spark, SmartFire spark, and short-duration/high-power spark systems. Using proprietary pricing information, the authors predicted that the commercial costs for the AC spark, the short-duration/high-power spark and SmartFire spark systems will be comparable (if not less) to the glow plug system. Task 2 involved designing and performing bench tests to determine the criteria for the ignition system and the prototype spark plug for Task 3.

2500|$|Unlike {{gasoline}} and {{liquefied petroleum gas}} engines, diesel engines do not use high-voltage spark <b>ignition</b> (spark <b>plugs).</b> An engine running on diesel compresses the air inside the cylinder to high pressures and temperatures (compression ratios from 14:1 to 18:1 are common in current diesel engines); the engine generally injects the diesel fuel directly into the cylinder, starting a few degrees {{before top dead center}} (TDC) and continuing during the combustion event. The high temperatures inside the cylinder cause the diesel fuel to react with the oxygen in the mix (burn or oxidize), heating and expanding the burning mixture to convert the thermal/pressure difference into mechanical work, i.e., to move the piston. [...] Engines have glow plugs and grid heaters to help start the engine by preheating the cylinders to a minimum operating temperature. Diesel engines are lean burn engines, burning the fuel in more air than is needed for the chemical reaction. [...] They thus use less fuel than rich burn spark ignition engines which use a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (just enough air to react with the fuel). As Professor Harvey of the University of Toronto notes, [...] "due to the absence of throttling , and the high compression ratio and lean fuel mixture, diesel engines are substantially more efficient than spark-ignited engines", generally; Harvey cites the side-by-side comparisons of Schipper et al. and the estimates of >20% lower fuel use and (given differences in energy content between fuel types) >15% lower energy use. Gas turbine and some other types of internal combustion engines, and external combustion engine, both can also be designed to take diesel fuel.|$|R
