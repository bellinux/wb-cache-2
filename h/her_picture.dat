5|$|In 1999, while {{a sophomore}} at Pennsylvania State University, Parker and his roommate and wrestling teammate, Jean McGianni Celestin, were accused of raping a fellow student. The unnamed accuser stated that Parker and Celestin raped her while she was {{intoxicated}} and unconscious, {{and that she was}} unsure of how many people had been involved. The woman later went to a doctor, who concluded that she had been sexually assaulted, and local authorities taped a phone conversation between her and Parker in which Parker confirmed that it was he and Celestin who had sex with her. She also stated that the two harassed her after she pressed charges, and that they hired a private investigator who showed <b>her</b> <b>picture</b> around campus, revealing her identity.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Stefani showed {{interest}} in making film appearances and began auditioning for films such as Mr. & Mrs. Smith. She made her acting debut playing Jean Harlow in Martin Scorsese's The Aviator in 2004. Scorsese, whose daughter was a No Doubt fan, showed reciprocal {{interest in}} casting Stefani after seeing <b>her</b> <b>picture</b> from a Marilyn Monroe-inspired photo shoot for Teen Vogue in 2003. To prepare for the role, Stefani read two biographies and watched 18 of Harlow's films. Shooting her part took four to five days, and Stefani had few lines. Stefani lent her voice to the title character of the 2004 video game Malice; before completion, however, the company opted not to use No Doubt band members' voices.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the cast}} members {{at the time were}} {{relatively}} unknown actors—Texans who had played roles in commercials, television, and stage shows, as well as performers whom Hooper knew personally, such as Allen Danziger and Jim Siedow. Involvement in the film propelled some of them into the motion picture industry. The lead role of Sally was given to Marilyn Burns, who had appeared previously on stage and served on the film commission board at UT Austin while studying there. Teri McMinn was a student who worked with local theater companies, including the Dallas Theater Center. Henkel called McMinn to come in for a reading after he spotted <b>her</b> <b>picture</b> in the Austin American-Statesman. For her last call-back he requested that she wear short shorts, which proved to be the most comfortable of all the cast members' costumes.|$|E

25|$|Painters {{continued}} to include Jane Seymour in pictures of King Henry VIII long after she died, mainly because Henry {{continued to}} look back on her with favour as the only wife who gave him a son. Most of the artists copied the portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger {{because it was the only}} full-sized picture available. After Catherine Howard was executed, even the Howard family removed <b>her</b> <b>picture</b> from their family portrait gallery.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} was first shown on 30 April 1943 at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. The {{next day it}} was reproduced in eight British newspapers.

In January 1974 Dugdale and other IRA members, including Eddie Gallagher, hijacked a helicopter in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. Dugdale and Gallagher used the helicopter to drop bombs in milk churns on the RUC station in Strabane in Northern Ireland, the first helicopter bombing raid {{in the history of}} the British Isles.

25|$|Memorabilia are {{singular}} objects {{which are}} passed {{down through the}} family with the stories and memories about events or individuals attached to them. In one family a doll, given once as a Christmas present, continued to be brought out each year to celebrate Christmas and have <b>her</b> <b>picture</b> taken with the (changing) family. For her hundredth birthday, a birthday cake for the doll {{was included in the}} Christmas celebration. Like the doll, almost any object imbued with family stories and memories can become a family heirloom. As such, it holds in the family a value often unrelated to its monetary value. As the stories and memories enveloping the object are slowly lost, the object itself becomes a simple hand-me-down, usually in poor condition and ready to be discarded.|$|E
25|$|While Charles was in Paris, Marie {{wrote to}} him passionate love letters {{and sent him}} <b>her</b> <b>picture,</b> {{as well as a}} Christmas cake {{in the spirit of the}} season. He ate a piece of it and {{suddenly}} became violently ill soon after. As cholera-like symptoms were common in those days, he did not think about consulting with a physician, but threw the cake away, thinking that it became spoiled in transit. When he returned to Le Glandier, having raised some money, he still felt ill. Marie put him to bed and fed him venison and truffles. Almost immediately, Charles was again afflicted with la maladie parisienne. The family physician, Dr. Bardon, agreed with its cholera-like symptoms and was not suspicious when Marie asked him for a prescription for arsenic, in order to kill the rats that disturbed her husband during the evening.|$|E
25|$|Collections of {{household}} waste were halted temporarily to allow police to search all bins {{in the area}} for evidence.

On 3 December 2000 police staged a reconstruction of the girls' last movements, reenacted by Sarah Whitehouse and Tiernan's older sister Michelle, in the hope of jogging the memory of potential witnesses about Leanne's movements. Detectives also sent text messages to Tiernan's mobile phone, which was now switched off, but had briefly been activated on 27 November 2000.
