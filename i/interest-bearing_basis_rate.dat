These <b>basis</b> <b>rates</b> will be analysed using both vibrational (isotropic) and rotational line-width data. The data sets are analysed individually and in combination. For all fits, parameter correlations are determined. In addition, the sensitivity of the goodness of fit to variations in the effective interaction length for collisions, le, is investigated.

Rotenone retarded cell growth, as shown by decreases in fresh weight, dry weight and cell numbers on a suspension-volume <b>basis.</b> However, <b>rates</b> of the coupled respiration were higher in rotenone-treated compared to control cells when expressed on a fresh-weight <b>basis.</b> <b>Rates</b> of the rotenone-insensitive respiration increased substantially on both a fresh-weight and extractable-cellular-protein basis 24 [*]h after rotenone treatment. ATP/ADP ratios were not significantly different between control and rotenone-treated cells.

In present survey research it is tried to provide a <b>basis</b> for <b>rating</b> of firms listed in Tehran Securities Exchange with emphasis on earnings quality. In order to present a <b>rating</b> <b>basis,</b> primary and secondary questions were raised through questionnaires completed by statistical population. Then using software SPSS and Chi square tests, hypotheses and sub-hypotheses of research were tested at confidence interval 95 %. Results from test of hypotheses showed that {{there was a significant difference}} between observed frequency and expected frequency and also questions on disclosure and providing financial statements, generated cash flows and inventories were of higher average scores compared to other primary questions influential in providing a <b>rating</b> <b>basis.</b> Secondary questions with scores higher than 4. 75 were selected so that the <b>basis</b> provided for <b>rating</b> is of high reliance.

50|$|Despite the {{shutdown}} of the IgT design center in Gaithersburg {{in the aftermath}} of the telecom bubble, IgT was a fair investment for PMC-Sierra. The substantial rate of return from IgT is due to the combination of the moderate price paid by PMC, the strong financial return provided by the AAL1gator family of products, and the contribution of the remaining San Jose team to several successful PMC projects, including the strong selling Arrow2xGE Ethernet over SONET mapping device. When evaluated on a <b>rate</b> of ROI <b>basis</b> (<b>rate</b> of Return on Investment), IgT likely ranks second amongst the 14 Sierra/PMC-Sierra acquisitions, behind the acquisition of PMC by Sierra Semiconductor.|$|R

Next, a method is developed for determining the closed loop transfer function of multiloop, multirate sampled-data systems with noninteger ratio sampling rates. Previously, this process involved solving a complex system of equations with rational polynomial coefficients. Herein, this is avoided by introducing a systematic decomposition of matrix operators which naturally arise from the switch decomposition method. The matrix operators are simplified by introducing the shifted transforms of signals sampled {{at one of the}} faster rates...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between vivid visual mental images and unexpected recall (incidental recall) was replicated, refined and extended. In Experiment 1, {{participants were asked}} to generate mental images from imagery-evoking verbal-cues (controlled on several verbal properties) and then, on a trial-by-trial <b>basis,</b> <b>rate</b> the vividness of their images; thirty minutes later, participants were surprised with a task requiring free recall of the cues. Higher vividness ratings predicted better incidental recall of the cues than individual differences (whose effect was modest). Distributional analysis of image latencies through ex-Gaussian modeling showed an inverse relation between vividness and latency. However, recall was unrelated to image latency. The follow-up Experiment 2 showed that the processes underlying trial-by-trial vividness ratings are unrelated to the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ), as further supported by a meta-analysis of a randomly selected sample of relevant literature. The present findings suggest that vividness may act as an index of availability of long-term sensory traces, playing a non-epiphenomenal role in facilitating the access of those memories...|$|R

Within each region and for each variable considered, cesarean section deliveries rose fairly uniformly. Nationally, C-sections comprised 5. 5 percent of all deliveries in 1970, but rose steadily to comprise 15. 2 percent of all deliveries in 1978. Overall, 1978 rates were highest in the Northeast, among whites, among women age 30 and over, among married women, in hospitals with 500 beds or more, and in proprietary hospitals. The mean length of the mother's hospital stay in 1978 was 6. 7 days for cesarean section deliveries and 3. 2 days for other deliveries, down from the mean hospital stay of 7. 8 days for C-sections and 3. 9 days for other deliveries observed in 1970...|$|R
