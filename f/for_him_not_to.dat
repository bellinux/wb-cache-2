5|$|First, Frederick {{had assumed}} {{he could use}} his trade-mark oblique order attack, but his {{reconnaissance}} had been incomplete. The Russians {{had been there for}} two weeks, had dug in to prepare for Frederick's arrival, and their fortifications bristled with abatis and guns. When he did arrive, Frederick had made limited efforts to assess the terrain and there was no operational reason <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have sent some of his cavalry to scout the area, except, perhaps, that his hussars, previously often used in reconnaissance, were being converted by Seydlitz into heavy cavalry. In the two weeks they had to prepare for the battle, the Russians and the Austrians had discovered, and reinforced, a causeway between the lakes and the marshland that allowed them to present Frederick with a united southeastern front. This effectively cancelled any advantage of the oblique battle order employed so successfully at Rossbach and Leuthen. Furthermore, the Russians utilized several natural defensive positions. The chain of hillocks could be enhanced by the construction of redans; the Russians were able to shape abutments from which to fire down upon the Prussians; they also constructed bastions, especially on the Spitzberge. Despite the murderous fire, Frederick's troops eventually turned the Russian left, but to little benefit. The terrain allowed the Russians and Austrians to form a compact front up to 100 men deep, shielded by the hills and marshes.|$|E
25|$|The Australian captain Allan Border {{threatened}} to resign if Australia {{did not win}} the four game One Day International series and then saw New Zealand go 2-0 up. Fortunately Australia won {{the last two games}} and Matthews was Man of the Match in the Fourth ODI at Eden Park, where he made 54, took 9-1-33-3 and held onto three catches in Australia's 44 run win. This allowed Border to announce that the team had improved enough <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> resign, much to the advantage of Australian cricket.|$|E

Zahida Kakachi was going to experience a Parisian Christmas; She had wanted to go to Midnight Mass {{to see what it was}} like. Christophe Morin was especially anxious to get home. A few months before (over the summer), his brother and sister had both died, so Morin had asked Air France if it was possible <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> fly during the actual Christmas celebrations, but they had refused his request... so he went to work on the flight feeling very reluctant, because he had wanted to be with his parents and family.|$|E

500|$|The {{endorsement}} of CIO head John L. Lewis probably gave Willkie Michigan, and he gained {{ground in the}} suburbs and rural areas, but Roosevelt consolidated his 1936 coalition of working-class Americans, minorities, and Southerners to take the election. On the evening of November 11, Willkie gave a nationwide radio address, urging those who had voted <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> oppose Roosevelt on all issues, but to give support where it was called for. In late November, Willkie interrupted a Florida vacation for a speech he concluded by offering a toast [...] "to the health and happiness of the President of the United States"; Roosevelt confided to his son James: [...] "I'm happy I've won, but I'm sorry Wendell lost".|$|E

500|$|There {{are other}} {{possibilities}} beyond madness or religious fervor {{that may have}} led to Smart's confinement: Newbery may have used the imprisonment of his son-in-law as leverage to control the publication of Smart's work and as a warning to others who worked <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> cross him. Another theory suggests Smart's actions were a result of alcohol, and {{had nothing to do with}} a mental imbalance. However, Smart may have been imprisoned for embarrassing his father-in-law in some way, which could have resulted from an incident in which Smart drank. Hester Thrale reinforced this latter possibility when she claimed that Smart's [...] "religious fervor" [...] tended to coincide with times that Smart was intoxicated. Smart's own testimony that he [...] "blessed God in St. James's Park till I routed all the company" [...] (Jubilate Agno B 90–91) as representing his religious madness is equally dismissed as resulting from drinking, as he was known for pulling pranks and the Board of Green Cloth, the government body that controlled St James's Park, would treat most disturbances in the park as resulting from madness. If Smart was placed into the asylum as a result of actions at St James's, he would not have been the only one, since records show that the Board of Green Cloth was responsible for admitting sixteen people to Bethlem Hospital for [...] "frenzy" [...] at St James's Park during the century prior to Smart being placed in St Luke's.|$|E

2500|$|Walker's {{situation}} was not helped by MacArthur's unrealistic demands from Tokyo <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> retreat an inch. [...] Attempting to obey, Walker gave a bombastic [...] "not a step back" [...] speech {{to his staff}} and subordinate commanders which did not go over well. [...] Nor did it stop the North Korean troops from pushing back American and South Korea troops which had been badly mauled in the opening days of the invasion, even further. As American and South Korean forces retreated further east and south, they finally arrived at a defensible line on the Nakdong River. They took advantage of shortened supply routes and a relatively good road network to exploit the advantages of [...] "interior lines". [...] Walker was able to quickly shift his units from point to point, stopping North Korean attacks before they could be reinforced. A critical advantage General Walker had was that U.S. military intelligence had cracked the North Korean radio codes, enabling Walker to know every major North Korean Army movement prior to the event.|$|E
2500|$|Following these events, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Big Brother Disco" [...] {{endurance}} Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests stood atop gold discs attached to the tops of hanging disco balls and were spun around continuously while holding on with the chains used to attach the disco balls to the metal structure. The last HouseGuest remaining on their ball without falling would become the new Head of Household. When James and Natalie were the last two remaining, James promised Natalie that both she and Matt would be safe if she allowed him to win Head of Household. This led to Natalie {{dropping out of the}} competition, making James the winner. James, upset that three people had voted <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> return, attempted to figure out who had voted for Alex to return. Though Ryan and Sheila confessed to their votes, Matt continued to deny that he had cast the third vote. On Day 36, James chose to nominate Ryan and Sheila for eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Matt, Chelsia, and Joshuah were selected to compete; Natalie was selected to host. On Day 37, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Trapped in the Cage" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, players were required to walk along a series of balance beams in an attempt to transfer 500 blocks from a cage to their tube. They could only move two blocks at a time, and dropping a block or falling would result in their elimination; the first HouseGuest to successfully get their blocks into their tube would win. James was the winner, making him the first HouseGuest this season to win both Head of Household and Power of Veto in the same week. Despite James wanting to backdoor Adam, Sharon later convinced James that Matt had been the third vote and should be evicted that week. On Day 39, James chose to use the Power of Veto to remove Sheila from the block, with Matt being nominated in her place. On Day 42, Matt became the eighth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when James broke a tie in Ryan's favor. He became the first member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E
