50|$|While a Class 1 raceboat {{is highly}} {{technical}} and state-of-the-art, and its overall performance {{is dependent on}} design, aero and hydro dynamics, choice of propeller and <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>selection,</b> the relationship between driver and throttleman, who navigate and control the power, must provide direct input to adjust trim and drive settings during a race or official qualifying, is ultimately the defining factor and crucial to performance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effect of}} this {{arrangement}} was that the gear ratio between an engine and the output shaft depended on how many engines were driving the transmission. <b>Gear</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>selection</b> was accomplished not by [...] "changing gear" [...] in the conventional sense, but by filling or draining the hydraulic couplings to connect or disconnect the engines from the transmission. With only one hydraulic coupling filled with oil {{and the other three}} engines disconnected and their respective input shafts to the transmission locked by the one-way clutches, the single engine drove the output shaft through an effective gear ratio of 4:1. With two engines driving, the effective gear ratio was 2:1; with three engines, 1.33:1; and with all four engines, unity. In other words, the effective gear ratio of the transmission was the inverse of the number of engines driving it.|$|E

50|$|Manual {{transmissions}} use {{a mechanical}} clutch to transmit torque, {{rather than a}} torque converter, thus avoiding {{the primary source of}} loss in an automatic transmission. Manual transmissions also avoid the power requirement of the hydraulic control system, by relying on the human muscle power of the vehicle operator to disengage the clutch and actuate the gear levers, and the mental power of the operator to make appropriate <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>selections.</b> Thus the manual transmission requires very little engine power to function, with the main power consumption due to drag from the gear train being immersed in the lubricating oil of the gearbox.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- For years, CVTs {{have been}} {{targeted}} at reducing vehicle fuel consumption and emissions, requiring high efficiency an sufficient ratio spread. A {{fun to drive}} is important for customer acceptance in Europe. The introduction of new transmission concepts such as 6 -speed stepped automatic, auto-shift manual and dual clutch transmissions places new challenges for a state-of-the-art CVT transmission concept. Effective <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> can be changed through infinite numbers through continuously variable transmission (cvt) between maximum and minimum values. This is overcome on others which allow few <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>selections.</b> The angular velocity of driving shaft is maintained by the flexibility of cvt. So the economy of fuel is enabling the engine speedily with most efficient resolution per minute. A belt-driven design offers approximately 88 % efficiency by enabling the engine to run at its most efficient revolutions per minute (RPM) {{for a range of}} vehicle speeds. Thus this technique is useful to balance between fuel efficiency and cost of manufacturing. Index Terms- continuously variable transmission; driving shaft; revolutions per minute...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{a series}} viscous actuator, {{composed}} of a viscous rotary damper connected to the output of a geared electric motor, is proposed as a novel solution to the high actuator impedances encountered when using such a motor. High impedances can be undesirable when interacting with the environment or animal subjects as unexpected forces may damage already-compromised joints. A state space model for the series viscous actuator was derived and verified by measurements upon a physical system. Physical design considerations for implementing a series viscous actuator, such as the appropriate <b>gearing</b> <b>ratio</b> and damper <b>selection,</b> are discussed and supported using the derived model. by Nicholas Eric Wiltsie.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{ascertain}} if <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>selection</b> would have an effect on peak power and time to peak power production in elite Bicycle Motocross (BMX) cyclists. Eight male elite BMX riders volunteered for the study. Each rider performed three, 10 -s maximal sprints on an Olympic standard indoor BMX track. The riders' bicycles were fitted with a portable SRM power meter. Each rider performed the three sprints using gear ratios of 41 / 16, 43 / 16 and 45 / 16 tooth. The results from the 41 / 16 and 45 / 16 gear ratios were compared to the current standard 43 / 16 gear ratio. Statistically, significant differences were found between the gear ratios for peak power (F(2, 14) [*]=[*] 6. 448; p[*]=[*]. 010) and peak torque (F(2, 14) [*]=[*] 4. 777; p[*]=[*]. 026), but no significant difference was found for time to peak power (F(2, 14) [*]=[*] 0. 200; p[*]=[*]. 821). When comparing gear ratios, the results showed a 45 / 16 gear ratio elicited the highest peak power, 1658 [*]±[*] 221  W, compared to 1436 [*]±[*] 129  W and 1380 [*]±[*] 56  W, for the 43 / 16 and 41 / 16 ratios, respectively. The time to peak power showed a 41 / 16 tooth gear ratio attained peak power in - 0. 01  s and a 45 / 16 in 0. 22  s compared to the 43 / 16. The findings of this study suggest that gear ratio choice has a significant effect on peak power production, though time to peak power output is not significantly affected. Therefore, selecting a higher gear ratio results in riders attaining higher power outputs without reducing their start time...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{composition}} of {{board of directors}} has become an important issue since {{the onset of the}} financial crisis which questioned the efficiency of company boards. Several countries including the United Kingdom (UK) have taken measures {{to increase the number of}} women on company boards but the number of women on boards is still very low. Studies have been conducted on board composition and company performance and results have been varied and inconsistent hence justifying the need for this study. Objective The purpose of this study was to analyse the relationship between women on the board of directors and financial measures of company performance. Research Strategy This study was a quantitative research which made use of data relating to board composition and to company performance. The variables used in this study were; the number of women on the board, return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA), profit margin, gross margin, current <b>ratio</b> and <b>gearing</b> <b>ratio.</b> Sample <b>Selection</b> and Analysis The study made use of a sample of 40 companies selected randomly from across four industries; retail, travel and leisure, food and beverage and household, leisure and personal goods, on the FTSE all share index and listed on the London Stock exchange. Data was compiled and analysed using SPSS software and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique. The period for which financial data was collected was mainly from 2009 to 2011. Findings The results obtained from this study showed no evidence of significant relationship between women on the board of directors and financial measures of company performance. Future studies should include quantitative and qualitative measure of company performance...|$|R

50|$|A high <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> {{occurs when}} the {{contraction}} velocity of the whole muscle {{is much greater than}} that of an individual muscle fiber, resulting in a <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> that is greater than 1. A high <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> will result in low force, high velocity contractions of the entire muscle. The angle of pennation will increase during contraction accompanied by an increase in thickness. Thickness is defined as the area between the aponeuroses of the muscle. A low <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> {{occurs when the}} contraction velocity of the whole muscle and individual fibers is approximately the same, resulting in a <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. Conditions resulting in a low <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> include high force and low velocity contraction of the whole muscle. The pennation angle typically shows little variation.

30|$|We {{conducted}} {{series of}} experiments and obtained quantitative results about the shoulder joint contact force for lever propulsion on three different <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> of the lever propulsion mechanism. These results were also compared with the experimental results from a handrim propulsion test. For our trials we developed a special mechatronic wheelchair simulator that allowed simulation of different <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> of the lever propulsion mechanism. Further, we examined {{the effect of the}} <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of lever-propulsion mechanism on the shoulder joint contact force. For that purpose, we also conducted {{series of experiments}} where the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> was varied from 1.5 to 1 and 1 / 1.5. Experimental results showed that shoulder joint contact force during lever propulsion mechanism with <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> 1 / 1.5 was up to 70  % lower than the shoulder joint contact force during handrim propulsion. Although this study was limited to three <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> of the propulsion mechanism, it evidences the positive effect of the lever propulsion mechanisms with <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> Our plan is to conduct further lever-propulsion experiments for different <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> and target speeds.

25|$|In pennate muscles, {{segments}} {{with higher}} pennation angles put out less force per shortening muscle fiber. Therefore, the architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of a pennate muscle {{is higher than}} the architectural <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of spindle like muscles (e.g. fusiform).

2500|$|On some bicycles, {{there is}} only one gear and the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is fixed.

5000|$|There {{is also a}} {{transmission}} called a torque converter, or CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission).

50|$|In {{the case}} of bicycle chains, it is {{possible}} to modify the overall <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of the chain drive by varying the diameter (and therefore, the tooth count) of the sprockets {{on each side of the}} chain.

A multi-speed bicycle, by providing two or three different-sized driving sprockets and up to 11 (as of 2014) different-sized driven sprockets, allows up to 33 different <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> The resulting lower <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> make the bike easier to pedal up hills while the higher <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> make the bike more powerful to pedal on flats and downhills.
