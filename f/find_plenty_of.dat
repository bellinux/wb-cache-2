5|$|To {{finance the}} scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with Charles T. Barney, {{president}} of the city's third-largest trust, the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that he needed much more money than he had to attempt the squeeze and Barney declined to provide funding. Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers were able to <b>find</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.|$|E
500|$|After its release, Born This Way: The Remix {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. It earned an overall score of 57 out of 100, on review aggregator site Metacritic. Jason Lipshultz from Billboard {{commented that the}} album did not re-invent anything new in terms of remix composition, but instead [...] "gives less recognizable artists a platform to tinker with these complex pop schemes." [...] He added that the album is not essential listening for non-Gaga diehards, [...] "but electronica fans who have yet to drink the Mother Monster kool-aid will <b>find</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> pristinely produced club tracks to groove to. The album is a great avenue for fans to digest new versions of their favorite songs of the year, as well as discover artists {{that are trying to}} command audiences the way Gaga so masterfully does." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "some remixes take considerable liberty, ditching verses or hooks, whatever catches their fancy. So, it’s a remix album not for fairweather travelers but rather the hardcore Little Monsters, the kind who love every gesture grand or small from Gaga, but it also displays enough imagination to appeal to those listeners who fall into neither camp and are only looking for some darkly elastic dance." [...] Harley Brown of Consequence of Sound website was impressed with the diversity of remixes on the album, prompting him to comment that [...] "just in time for the holiday season, there’s something for everyone on Born This Way: The Remix. And, unlike many remix albums featuring one song reworked again and again, this Remix comprises a diverse tracklist to match the diverse list of remixers." ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} the nature of local knowledge spillovers and their importance for innovation in clusters in developing countries. Using detailed primary data about a cluster of software firms in Montevideo, Uruguay, the paper <b>finds</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> evidence of the existence of pure unintentional knowledge spillovers. In addition, it supports previous theoretical studies that have contended that there are also many knowledge flows that are to some degree produced purposively by local parties—these flows can be placed somewhere in between pure spillovers and pure market transactions. While the respondents themselves place most value on knowledge flows that are more or less purposively co-produced with customer transactions, a more objective statistical analysis shows that good product/service-innovation performance is associated with intensive use of flows with more pronounced spillover characteristics. The respondents possibly underrate the latter because of their invisibility and spontaneous nature. Heavy use of knowledge flows lying close to the market-transaction side of the spectrum is found to be associated with relatively advanced organizational capability, but not with product innovation. Overall, the findings point towards the relevance of cluster-based policies to promote innovation in a less developed country context. Various policy measures to stimulate the local circulation of knowledge are suggested. Clusters, developing countries, local knowledge spillovers, knowledge flows, Uruguay,...|$|R
