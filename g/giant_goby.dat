50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>goby</b> inhabits rock pools {{high up in}} the {{intertidal}} zone of sheltered shores. Occupied pools typically contain boulders under which the <b>giant</b> <b>goby</b> can take shelter, and have inputs of freshwater, so the water in the pools is usually brackish.|$|E
50|$|Animals {{within the}} zone include stalked {{jellyfish}} such as Lucernariopsis campanulata and Lucernariopsis cruxmelitensis, and a fish the <b>giant</b> <b>goby</b> (Gobius cobitis).|$|E
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>goby</b> (Gobius cobitis) is {{a species}} of goby native to coastal marine and {{brackish}} waters of the eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea at depths of from 10 to 35 m. This species is of minor importance to commercial fisheries and is also popular as a game fish.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, <b>giant</b> <b>gobies</b> {{were absent}} from one site in south Devon {{and one from}} south Cornwall, which are parts of the {{historic}} range. It was assumed that the species was in decline, but the species was recorded again in the south Cornwall site in 1998. Although {{there is no evidence}} that the species is endangered in the UK, it seems likely that it is vulnerable to human disturbance due to the recreational pressures on the shore habitat.|$|R
40|$|There are {{presently}} 209 known, non-indigenous {{plants and animals}} that have been introduced into the Great Lakes basin between 1800 and 1999, of which 77 % (162) are aquatic species (Mills et al. 1993). Routes of entry into the Great Lakes basin include canals and diversions, fish stocking programs, private aquaculture, the bait industry, recreational boating, ballast water from the shipping industry, the live food fish industry, the ornamental pond/aquarium trade, intentional and unintentional releases, and unknown sources. A recent study in Ontario found that the greatest potential pathways for future introduction and spread of invasive aquatic species are associated with ballast water from the shipping industry, the live food fish industry, and the ornamental pond/aquarium trade (Kerr et al. 2005). The introduction or invasion of exotic species can result in significant changes that usually affect the entire Great Lakes basin. Non-indigenous species that have been present {{for many years in}} our lakes include alewife, sea lamprey, common carp, goldfish, and rainbow smelt. These species have caused significant changes in both Great lakes and inland lake aquatic communities. Species that presently are invading many Great Lakes and inland lake systems include zebra mussels, curly-leaf pondweed, Eurasian water-milfoil, purple loosestrife, <b>giant</b> reed, <b>gobies,</b> Eurasian ruffe, various micro-invertebrate zooplankton (Bythotrephe...|$|R
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>goby,</b> which {{grows to}} 27 cm in length, is greyish to olive brown with 'pepper and salt' markings. These are {{especially}} notable in smaller specimens. in the breeding season the male is {{darker than the}} female. The body is covered in small scales, and the tail stalk is short. The eyes are small.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, the <b>giant</b> <b>goby</b> {{is known}} {{only from the}} coasts of {{south-west}} England between Wembury and the Isles of Scilly. Outside of the UK it is found from the western English Channel to Morocco, in the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and the Gulf of Suez, more than likely a Lessepsian migrant via the Suez Canal.|$|E
50|$|In Great Britain in 1998 {{the species}} {{was added to}} Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Under this Act it is an offence to kill, injure, take or sell giant gobies, or to damage or destroy any {{structure}} or place used by a <b>giant</b> <b>goby</b> for shelter or protection. Furthermore, it is included in English Nature's Species Recovery Programme.|$|E
