50|$|Tilman (formerly Incents), until September 2010, {{was both}} a {{boarding}} and day boy house. The boarding accommodation is situated along Chesham Road, and is the birthplace of Graham Greene. The House was named after John Incent, the School's founder and had its main entrance in the cloisters between Loxwood and Greenes. In September 2010, Incents day house closed and was renamed 'Tilman' {{and moved to a}} new location {{on the site of the}} old swimming pool, sharing the site with Cox's. The former Incents House was renovated into a study for the <b>Headmaster</b> <b>and</b> <b>Deputy</b> <b>Head</b> of Berkhamsted Boys. The boarding house remained unchanged.

50|$|MGS is also twinned with {{a school}} in Uganda. MGS became linked with the Busoga College Mwiri in 1990 as a {{consequence}} of their support for the Busoga Trust. The school donated second-hand science equipment, textbooks and, in 1998, equipped the Mwiri computer centre with almost one hundred PCs. A succession of MGS pupils have been to Mwiri to teach for a term in their gap year and five members of MGS staff and the School Medical Officer have made a combined total of over 20 visits to Mwiri. Some of MGS's pupils first formers (year 7) visited the college in 2003. In return Chairmen of Governors, <b>Headmasters</b> <b>and</b> <b>Deputy</b> <b>Heads</b> from Mwiri have visited MGS. A programme has been initiated to enable one member of the Mwiri staff each year to visit MGS for three weeks in September. This scheme was the brainchild of former Head of Physics, Roger Hand, who retired in 2008.|$|R

40|$|Various {{problems}} arise in local governance in Indonesia. One {{of them is}} the problem coming from the regional <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>deputy</b> <b>head</b> of the region. Among these problems is a condition in which the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>deputy</b> <b>head</b> of the region were often strained shortly after they elected. Between the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>deputy</b> <b>head</b> of the region is often a conflict of interest because each feel have contributed the same in the process of winning the position of <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>deputy</b> <b>head</b> of the region.
