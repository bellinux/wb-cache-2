5|$|Betances {{returned}} to Puerto Rico in April 1856. At the time, a cholera epidemic was spreading across the island. The epidemic {{made its way}} to Puerto Rico's western coast in July 1856, and hit the city of Mayagüez particularly hard. At the time, Betances was one of five doctors that would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of 24,000 residents. Both he and Dr. José Francisco Basora (who became lifelong friends and colleagues from that point on) would alert the city government and press the city managers into taking preventive action.|$|E
5|$|An {{emergency}} subscription {{fund was}} established {{by some of the}} city's wealthiest citizens. Betances and Basora had the city's unsanitary slave barracks torched and a temporary camp set up for its dwellers. A large field at a corner of the city was set aside for a supplementary cemetery, and Betances set and managed a temporary hospital next to it (which was later housed in a permanent structure and became the Hospital San Antonio, the Mayagüez municipal hospital, which still serves the city). However, the epidemic struck the city soon after; Betances' stepmother and one of his brothers-in-law would die from it. By October 1856 Betances would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the entire operation on his own temporarily.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} women in the Hebrew Bible, the two women in this story are anonymous. Perhaps their names have not been {{mentioned}} so that they would not overshadow Solomon's wisdom, which is the main theme of the story. The women seem to be poor. They live alone in a shared residence, without servants. As prostitutes, they lack male patronage and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of themselves in a patriarchal society.|$|E

2500|$|Following similar {{remarks to}} more questions, Kimmel closed the segment with this comment: [...] "Listen, Jay. Conan and I have children. All you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of is cars! We have lives to lead here! You've got eight hundred million dollars! For God's sakes, leave our shows alone!" [...] Leno never fought back and {{accepted}} the bit as comedy (he ascribed it as Kimmel attempting to score some publicity), but producer Vickers was furious.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, La Russa {{was asked}} about a tea party protest taking place during his game against the Arizona Diamondbacks that criticized the Diamondbacks' {{position}} against the controversial new Arizona immigration statute. La Russa expressed support for the Tea Partiers' {{right to free speech}} to protest at the ballpark. He also stated, [...] "I'm actually a supporter of what Arizona is doing... you know if people don't fix their problems they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of it themselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|In addition, Lee {{cited the}} past {{practice}} of MPs from neighbouring constituencies {{taking care of}} affairs in both SMCs and GRCs where casual vacancies had arisen. However, Thio has commented that these examples {{are based on the}} implicit assumption that political parties will always have more than one elected MP in Parliament. In her view, a [...] "lacuna in the law" [...] exists where a party has only one elected member. Should that member vacate his or her seat, in the event that a by-election is not called, it appears that an unelected member from the party who lacks a popular mandate would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the constituency temporarily.|$|E
2500|$|In the basement, while Hook contemplates an escape, Zelena {{says that}} her anti-magic cuff is the real problem. Hook says he has magic in his hook, but says that {{the last time he}} helped her, she betrayed him. She says that even though he doesn't know if he can trust her, he has no choice now. He slips off the cuff and she gets rid of her shackles, and puts herself into a fresh outfit, before coming over to Hook and undoing his shackles. Zelena tells Hook they have to sneak out the back, but Hook says he’s not going. When Zelena {{questions}} why, Hook says he needs to stop Emma, and Zelena bids him goodbye. Hook searches Emma's house then takes a painting off the wall, but then, Emma comes in, saying that she was trying to help Hook. Hook finds the squid ink {{on the back of the}} painting and splashes her with it, saying that she’s a villain now, like Regina said. He says she has to tell him what happened in Camelot, but Emma says that he can't make her. Zelena returns and says she that she couldn't leave without making the Dark One pay. Zelena stabs Hook in the chest, but he doesn't bleed or suffer any wounds, and he demands to know what’s happening. She says she found a Dreamcatcher outside, which can explain what happened. Emma whispers to him not to trust her and that she can explain everything. Hook tells Zelena to do it and she shows him his memories. The Dreamcatcher shows Hook his memories in Camelot, before showing him the events involving his current situation. It turns out that Hook was fatally wounded by Excalibur, and in order to save him, Emma tethered his life to Excalibur, which turned into another Dark One. Emma tells him that she’s sorry and says she had no choice. Hook says there must be another explanation. Zelena hands Hook the re-united Excalibur and she removes a glamour spell, and shows him that his name is on the bottom part of the sword while Emma’s name is on the dagger end, gloating about them being [...] "the Dark Ones." [...] Emma says she wanted to make up for this, and {{says that her}} plan was the only way to get rid of the darkness in both of them. She says all she did was to try to save him, but Hook is enraged, saying, [...] "So much for our future, Swan." [...] Zelena asks if he’s ready to find out what else happened in Camelot and he says yes, much to Emma's dismay. But Hook tells Zelena that first, they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of Emma.|$|E
