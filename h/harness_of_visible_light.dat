Doping with other ions can improve the absorption rate <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> and improve the TiO 2 photocatalytic activity by reducing the band gap of TiO 2 effectively and changing the electron-hole recombination rate. The recent progress of photocatalytic performance of ions-doped TiO 2 films is reviewed in this paper. Finally, the current existing problems are also presented...|$|R

40|$|A {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} protist cells {{is that they}} favor dark environments. The reason for this behavior is that UV radiation annihilates these cells. This phenomenon provided {{the basis of the}} research about ethanol fermentation that this paper deals with. Although there are extensive researches about effect of UV radiation there is little research about the effect of differing wavelengths <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> on these creatures. Since the yeast cells are one of the best known organisms in science and UV radiation affects them terribly, the scope of the experiment is chosen as Saccharomyces Cerevisiae cells. The objective {{of this study was to}} observe whether the volume of carbon dioxide produced by the S. Cervisiae during fermentation, in a certain time, is affected by varying wavelengths <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> spectrum. Thereupon, fixed masses of yeast were put into glucose solutions in respiration chambers illuminated by different wavelengths <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> for ten minutes and the alteration in the concentration of carbon dioxide were noted. It was found that as wavelength <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> increase the carbon dioxide formation of S. Cerevisiae cells increase. However it was as the wavelength <b>of</b> the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> increases its affect on the ethanol fermentation decreases. The highest carbon dioxide formation rate is achieved by the cells which were put in respiration chambers lighted by the wavelength of 460 nanometers with an average of 29154 ppm. The maximum wavelength which was applied was 650 nanometers and the result acquired was 17646 ppm. Overall, the fit of the data was a negative correlation supporting the hypothesis that the increase in wavelength will decrease the fermentation rate. Possibly, the reason of this effect that increasing wavelength <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> has on this species is that it hastens the process by giving energy to the specie...|$|R

The responses to near-ultraviolet were interrelated with intensity <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light.</b> The presence <b>of</b> near-ultraviolet (which accounted for less than 4 % of the total light energy) along with <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> resulted in component concentration differences similar to those caused by much greater increases <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> without near-ultraviolet...|$|R
50|$|When light strikes an object, {{it usually}} has {{not just a}} single {{frequency}} (or wavelength) but many.

This oversight is important considering that during outdoors activities skin is exposed to the full solar spectrum, including <b>visible</b> <b>light,</b> and to multiple exposures at different times and doses. Although the contribution of the UV component of sunlight to skin damage has been established, few studies have examined the effects of non-UV solar radiation on skin physiology in terms of inflammation, and limited information is available regarding the role <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> on pigmentation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect <b>of</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> on the pro-pigmentation pathways and melanin formation in skin. Exposure to <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> in ex-vivo and clinical studies demonstrated an induction of pigmentation in skin by <b>visible</b> <b>light.</b> Results showed that a single exposure to <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> induced very little pigmentation whereas multiple exposures with <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> resulted in darker and sustained pigmentation.
