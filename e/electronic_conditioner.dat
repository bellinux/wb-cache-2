5000|$|A TWTA {{consists}} of a traveling-wave tube coupled with its protection circuits (as in klystron) and regulated power supply <b>electronic</b> power <b>conditioner</b> (EPC), which may be supplied and integrated by a different manufacturer. The main difference between most power supplies and those for vacuum tubes is that efficient vacuum tubes have depressed collectors to recycle kinetic energy of the electrons, so the secondary winding of the power supply needs up to 6 taps of which the helix voltage needs precise regulation. The subsequent addition of a linearizer (as for inductive output tube) can, by complementary compensation, improve the gain compression and other characteristics of the TWTA; this combination is called a linearized TWTA (LTWTA, [...] "EL-tweet-uh").|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Resonant mode {{conversion}} techniques are used nowadays to improve pulse width modulated dc- dc converters. Moreover {{the quest for}} ever smaller 50 to 500 watts dc-dc switching supplies {{has led to the}} development of circuits that operates in 500 KHz- 1 MHz range and above. Since the parasitic elements that normally present in a power circuit can be very significant at this frequency, most of the work is focused on resonant topologies. The topology enables to advantageously employ transformer leakage inductance, MOSFET output capacitance and the MOSFET body diode, to easily move their designs upwards in frequency. The topology offers additional advantages like zero voltage switching at a constant switching frequency, which substantially reduces switching losses. The ability to move upwards in frequency will ultimately reduce the overall size of the power supply. A resonant transition converter is selected for developing a compact 30 W power supply for power requirements of an advanced <b>electronic</b> power <b>conditioner.</b> The switching frequency considered is 500 kHz for achieving the required power conversion density. At this switching frequency it is possible to take advantage of lead inductances and parasitic capacitance of switching MOSFETs to either eliminate or substantially reduce the resonant tank elements required for achieving a resonant transition conversion to improve efficiency...|$|R
40|$|A low cost, {{small size}} and mass, low heater power, durable {{high-performance}} barium dispenser thermionic cathode {{has been developed}} that offers significant advancements in the design, manufacture, and performance of the electron sources used in vacuum electronic devices [...] such as microwave (and millimeter wave) traveling-wave tubes (TWT's) [...] and in display devices such as high-brightness, high-resolution cathode ray tubes (CRT's). The lower cathode heater power and the reduced size and mass of the new cathode {{are expected to be}} especially beneficial in TWT's for deep space communications, where future missions are requiring smaller spacecraft, higher data transfer rates (higher frequencies and radiofrequency output power), and greater electrical efficiency. Also expected to benefit are TWT's for commercial and government communication satellites, for both low and geosynchronous Earth orbit, with additional benefits offered by lower cost and potentially higher cathode current loading. A particularly important TWT application is in the microwave power module (MPM), which is a hybrid microwave (or millimeter wave) amplifier consisting of a low-noise solid state driver, a vacuum power booster (small TWT), and an <b>electronic</b> power <b>conditioner</b> integrated into a single compact package. The attributes of compactness and potentially high electrical efficiency make the MPM very attractive for many commercial and government (civilian and defense) applications in communication and radar systems.

However, for the MPM to become competitive and commercially successful, a major reduction in cost must be achieved...|$|R
40|$|The high {{temperature}} of the surface of Venus poses many difficulties. Previous Venus landers have only operated for short durations before succumbing to the heat. NASA Glenn Research Center conducted a study on communications for long duration Venus surface missions. I report the findings in this presentation. Current technology allows production of communications transceivers that can operate {{on the surface of}} Venus, at temperatures above 450 C and pressures of over 90 atmospheres. While these transceivers would have to be relatively simple, without much of the advanced signal processing often used in modern transceivers, since current and near future integrated circuits cannot operate at such {{high temperature}}s, the transceivers will be able to meet the requirements of proposed Venus Surface mission. The communication bands of interest are High Frequency or Very High Frequency (HFNHF) for communication between Venus surface and airborne probes (including surface to surface and air to air), and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) to Microwave bands for communication to orbiters. For HFNHF, transceivers could use existing vacuum tube technology. The packaging of the vacuum tubes may need modification, but the internal operating structure already operates at high temperatures. Using metal vacuum structures instead of glass, allows operation at high pressure. Wide bandgap transistors and diodes may be able to replace some of the thermionic components. VHF communications would be useful for line-of- sight operations, while HF would be useful for short-wave type communications using the Venusian ionosphere. UHF and microwave communications use magnetically focused thermionic devices, such as traveling wave tubes (TWTs), magnetron (M-type) amplifiers, and klystrons for high power amplifiers, and backward wave oscillators (BWOs) and reflex klystrons for oscillators. Permanent magnets are already in use in industry that can operate at 500 C. These magnets could focus electron beam tubes on the surface of Venus. While microwave windows will need to be designed for the high pressure, diamond windows have already been demonstrated, so high-pressure microwave windows can be designed and built. Thus, all of these devices could be useful for Venus surface missions. Current <b>electronic</b> power <b>conditioners</b> to supply the high voltages used in these microwave devices cannot operate at high temperatures, but earlier <b>electronic</b> power <b>conditioners</b> that used vacuum tubes can be modified to work at high temperature. Evaluating the various devices in this study, the M-type traveling wave tube (where a traveling wave structure is used in a crossed-field device, similar to the Amplitron used on the Apollo missions) stood out for the high power amplifier since it requires a single high voltage, simplifying the power supply design. Since the receiver amplifier is a low power amplifier, the loss of efficiency in linear beam devices without a depressed collector (and thus needing a single high voltage) is not important; a low noise TWT is a possible solution. Before solid-state microwave amplifiers were available, such TWTs were built with a 1 - 2 dB noise figure. A microwave triode or transistor made from a wide bandgap material may be preferable, if available. Much of the development work needed for Venusian communication devices will need to focus on the packaging of the devices, and their connections, but the technology is available to build transceivers that can operate on the surface of Venus indefinitely...|$|R
40|$|New {{concepts}} of telecommunication satellites request very small, highly integrated and linearised travelling wave tube amplifiers (LTWTA). A linearised channel amplifier (LCAMP) and an <b>electronic</b> power <b>conditioner</b> (EPC) {{was developed to}} be integrated together building one unit for the C- and Ku-Band. The LCAMP was designed for a short travelling wave tube (STWT) and optimised mechanically for the integration with the developed EPC regarding best electrical performance, volume and weight. This could be realised by applying new components (like SMD-parts, ASIC and MMIC) {{and the development of}} a new housing. One major task was the selection of a MMIC-manufacturer, the designing of MMIC and the final testing for the LCAMP. A potential high-rel manufacturer (UMS- united microwave semiconductor) has been selected and the measured results of the MMIC are close to the calculated. An ESA-evaluation was performed in the frame of LVS-Study at UMS successfully. Bosch evaluated the market for microwave packages and selected finally Kyocera who provides packages for applications up to 20 GHz. The experience during procurement of packages was important for integration of MMIC into LCAMP. The LCAMP was integrated with the EPC in C- and Ku-band and finally tested with the STWT. Particular good results were measured for intermodulation products and phase shift behaviour. All other requirements of the integrated LTWTA were fulfilled, if they are in the nature of the LCAMP and EPC only. The achieved size of the EPC is 198 x 110 x 60, 5 mm and the total weight of the LTWTA is about 2300 grams (including channel amplifier, lineariser, EPC, STWT and connecting cables). (orig.)

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to conventional tubing instrumentation for measuring airflow, designers and technicians at the NASA Glenn Research Center have been fabricating packaging components and assembling a set of unique probes using commercial-off-the-shelf microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) integrated circuits (computer chips). Using MEMS as {{an alternative}} has some compelling advantages over standard measurement devices. Sensor technologies have matured through high-production usage in industries such as automotive and aircraft manufacturers. Currently, MEMS are the choice in applications such as tire pressure monitors, altimeters, pneumatic controls, cable leak detectors, and consumer appliances. Conventional instrumentation uses tubing buried in the model aerodynamic surfaces or wind tunnel walls. The measurements are made when pressure is introduced at the tube opening. The pressure then must travel the tubing for lengths ranging from 20 to hundreds of feet before reaching an <b>electronic</b> signal <b>conditioner.</b> This condition causes {{a considerable amount of}} damping and requires measurements to be made only after the test rig has reached steady-state operation. The electronic MEMS pressure sensor is able to take readings continuously under dynamic states in nearly real time. The use of stainless steel tubing for pressure measurements requires many tubes to be cleaned, cut to length, carefully installed, and delicately deburred and spliced for use. A cluster of a few hundred 1 / 16 -in. - (0. 0625 -in. -) diameter tubes (not uncommon in research testing facilities) can be several inches in diameter and may weigh enough to require two men to handle. Replacing hard tubing with electronic chips can eliminate much of the bulk. Each sensor would fit on the tip of the 1 / 16 -in. tubing with room to spare. The P 592 piezoresistive silicon pressure sensor (Lucas NovaSensor, Fremont, CA) was chosen for this project because of its cost, availability, and tolerance to extreme ambient conditions. The chip is 1 mm square by 0. 6 mm thick (0. 039 by 0. 023 in.) with 0. 12 -mm (0. 005 -in.) wire connection tabs. Three MEMS chips were used to build the first type of flow-angularity probe. This MEMS probe will be demonstrated as {{an alternative to}} a standard tube type "Cobra Probe" now used routinely in wind tunnel and aeronautical hardware applications. The response time and accuracy would allow the probe to be translated on an actuator across a flow field, yielding precision dynamic measurements not possible with conventional instrumentation. The low profile, the minimal power requirement, the rugged construction, and the moderate cost all contribute to making MEMS sensors the enticing choice instrument in future research measurement needs. The MEMS probe efforts are a continuation of work initiated by Brian Willis, without whose foresight and efforts this project would never have been realized. This task was funded through cooperation with the NASA Electronic Parts and Packaging (NEPP) program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory...|$|R
40|$|A low-cost, low-mass, {{electrically}} efficient, modular cathode/electron gun assembly {{has been}} developed by FDE Inc. of Beaverton, Oregon, under a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field. This new assembly offers significant improvements {{in the design and}} manufacture of microwave and millimeter wave traveling-wave tubes (TWT's) used for radar and communications. It incorporates a novel, low-heater-power, reduced size and mass, high-performance barium dispenser type thermionic cathode and provides for easy integration of the cathode into a large variety of conventional TWT circuits. Among the applications are TWT's for Earth-orbiting communication satellites and for deep space communications, where future missions will require smaller spacecraft, higher data transfer rates (higher frequencies and radiofrequency output power), and greater electrical efficiency. A particularly important TWT application is in the microwave power module (a hybrid microwave/millimeter wave amplifier consisting of a low-noise solid-state driver, a small TWT, and an <b>electronic</b> power <b>conditioner</b> integrated into a single compact package), where electrical efficiency and thermal loading are critical factors and lower cost is needed for successful commercialization. The design and fabrication are based on practices used in producing cathode ray tubes (CRT's), {{which is one of the}} most competitive and efficient manufacturing operations in the world today. The approach used in the design and manufacture of thermionic cathodes and electron guns for CRT's has been optimized for fully automated production, standardization of parts, and minimization of costs. It is applicable to the production of similar components for microwave tubes, with the additional benefits of low mass and significantly lower cathode heater power (less than half that of dispenser cathodes presently used in TWT s). Modular cathode/electron gun assembly. The modular cathode/electron gun assembly consists of four subassemblies the cathode, the focus electrode, the header (including the electrical feedthroughs), and the gun envelope (including the anode) a diagram of which is shown. The modular construction offers a number of significant advantages, including flexibility of design, interchangeability of parts, and a drop-in final assembly procedure for quick and accurate alignment. The gun can accommodate cathodes ranging in size from 0. 050 to 0. 250 -in. in diameter and is applicable to TWT's over a broad range of sizes and operating parameters, requiring the substitution of only a few parts: that is, the cathode, focus electrode, and anode. The die-pressed cathode pellets can be made with either flat or concave (Pierce gun design) emitting surfaces. The gun can be either gridded (pulse operation) or ungridded (continuous operation). Important factors contributing to low cost are the greater use of CRT materials and parts, the standardization of processes (welding and mechanical capture), and tooling amenable to automated production. Examples are the use of simple shapes, drawn or stamped metal parts, and parts joined by welding or mechanical capture. Feasibility was successfully demonstrated in the retrofit and testing of a commercial Kaband (22 -GHz) TWT. The modular cathode/electron gun assembly was computer modeled to replicate the performance of the original electron gun and fabricated largely from existing CRT parts. Significant test results included demonstration of low heater power (1. 5 -W, 1010 C brightness temperature for a 0. 085 -in. -diameter cathode), mechanical ruggedness (100 g shock and vibration tests in accordance with military specifications (MIL specs)), and a very fast warmup. The results of these tests indicate that the low-cost CRT manufacturing approach can be used without sacrificing performance and reliability...|$|R
