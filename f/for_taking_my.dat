25|$|My {{sister was}} slim and {{beautiful}} and friendly, and my mother always preferred her. I was the ugly duckling, fat and clumsy and unpopular. It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted... I'll never forgive her <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> childhood away. During all the years I should have been playing and growing up, I was singing or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.|$|E

Yes, {{it makes}} me {{impatient}} to hear you: but, however, you have suffered, {{and are likely to}} suffer enough <b>for</b> not <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> advice; so I'll say no more. Carter--hurry!--hurry! The sun will soon rise, and I must have him off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind, then; for I have {{a reason}} <b>for</b> not <b>taking</b> up <b>my</b> old cudgels against you, Elfie. Can you guess what the reason is?' ...|$|R
5000|$|... “My {{dear friend}} Osbald … I am {{disappointed}} in you <b>for</b> not <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> advice. I urged {{you in my}} letter that you should give up this way of life. Do not add sin to sin by ruining your country and shedding blood. Think how much blood of emperors, princes, and people has been shed through you and your clan.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will help}} you all I can, Upton. You have done me a great service, and I {{certainly}} owe the young lady much <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> child in and caring for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An {{excellent}} reason, then, <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> advice, and marrying me instantly! But you wander {{from the}} question. Where are you going? That {{is the issue}} now before the house. You persist in evading it." ...|$|E
6000|$|BUILDER. [In a voice {{different}} from any we have heard from him] Say! What business had he to touch me, a magistrate? I gave my daughter two taps with a cane in a private house, for interfering with me <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> wife home-- ...|$|E
60|$|My fair friend, Miss Clack, having {{laid down}} the pen, {{there are two reasons}} <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>taking</b> it up next, in my turn.|$|R
60|$|THE MAN [ignoring the interruption] Bless you <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> him off <b>my</b> hands! I {{have had}} as much of him as I can bear. [He goes {{down the steps and}} disappears].|$|R

60|$|She {{threw her}} lapful of flowers {{away from her}} {{on the table at}} which she was sitting. She became {{perfectly}} furious with him <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> side. I permitted myself (the poor child could not see it, remember), the harmless indulgence of a smile.|$|E
60|$|I {{had just}} given a porter the {{necessary}} directions <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> portmanteau to Mr. Keller's house, when I heard a woman's voice behind me asking {{the way to}} the Poste Restante--or, in our roundabout English phrase, the office of letters to be left till called for.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think we}} ever would have {{hit it off}} together; and I can't help a fancy that, after all, he didn't blame me very much <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> own way in spite of him," [...] he said.

5000|$|When Sir Stanley died in 1968, Unwin {{became the}} new {{chairman}} of the firm. His father had been preparing him for the role during his time at the firm; Rayner's older brother David had decided to pursue a career as a children's author instead. David Unwin later wrote in his memoirs: [...] "I have always felt guilty at <b>my</b> defection, <b>for</b> by <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> place Rayner sacrificed his own promising career as an author".|$|R
5000|$|The company's logo is {{the record}} symbol, which Gordon-Levitt {{can be seen}} wearing {{frequently}} in interviews, at events and appearances. The actor/founder says [...] "that round REC button became a symbol, a metaphor <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> things into <b>my</b> own hands and doing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you'll {{have to do}} {{what you}} can to cheer up both of them." [...] Dave drew a long breath. [...] "I do wish {{somebody}} would catch those two rascals, not only on your account but on my account also. I'd like to settle matters with Porton, for having impersonated me at those stores, and <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> cap and overcoat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One cannot do everything, and I'm not insatiable. I'm {{getting too}} old to stand the shaking in the hot and dusty cars, and I can't accustom myself to going to bed in public, without undressing. No doubt, it's a matter of prejudice, but I've been used to more room <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> clothes off than they give you behind the {{flapping}} curtain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, {{or any of}} {{the fifty}} men who have good reason <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> life, how long could I survive against my own pursuit? A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be over. It is well they don't have days of fog in the Latin {{countries}}--the countries of assassination. By Jove! here comes something at last to break our dead monotony." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but one moment," [...] said Peter. [...] "If I'm a vegetarian, {{how did you}} account <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>taking</b> all {{the chicken}} I could get at dinner last night, and looking as if I wanted more?" ...|$|R
30|$|And then {{everybody}} encouraged me <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of <b>my</b> dad and everybody persuaded {{me and said}} now you see you’re the older son of your dad and now he sees you here, and now he’s no longer sick, so… And I was really happy for that.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, my good woman," [...] said I, {{while the}} Bailie groaned and {{remained}} undecided, [...] "it is six hours since we dined, {{and we have}} not taken a morsel since. I am positively dying with hunger, and I have no taste <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> up <b>my</b> abode supperless among these mountains of yours. I positively must enter; and make the best apology you can to your guests for adding a stranger or two to their number. Andrew, you will see the horses put up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Danvers and I {{were both}} of opinion, Mr. Hawtrey, that by his tone and manner {{when he spoke}} to you about payment of debts, that he had already done you some injury or had some {{distinct}} plan in his head. At that time your daughter was not engaged to Lord Halliburn, and his ideas may have been vague ones until the public notice of the engagement met his eye, when he may have said to himself, [...] "This is my opportunity <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> revenge, by annoying both father and daughter."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will; I will; {{it looks}} {{brighter}} and better already, and I won't lose my one comfort by any fault of my own. Thank you so much, Mother Bhaer, <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> side. I felt so ungrateful and mean and crushed when I thought you all considered me a sneak {{who had no}} business to love such a precious girl as Daisy. No one said anything, but I knew how you felt, and that Mr Laurie sent me off partly {{to get me out}} of the way. Oh dear, life is pretty tough sometimes, isn't it?' And Nat took his head in both hands as if it ached with the confusion of hopes and fears, passions and plans that proved boyhood was past and manhood had begun.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Louisa!' said Mr Dombey. 'It is not {{necessary}} to prolong these observations. The woman is discharged and paid. You leave this house, Richards, <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> son--my son,' said Mr Dombey, emphatically repeating these two words, 'into haunts and into society which are not to be thought of without a shudder. As to the accident which befel Miss Florence this morning, I regard that as, in one great sense, a happy and fortunate circumstance; inasmuch as, but for that occurrence, I never could have known--and from your own lips too--of what you had been guilty. I think, Louisa, the other nurse, the young person,' here Miss Nipper sobbed aloud, 'being so much younger, and necessarily influenced by Paul's nurse, may remain. Have the goodness to direct that this woman's coach is paid to'--Mr Dombey stopped and winced--'to Staggs's Gardens.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he retorted, [...] "what do you expect, Percy, if {{you talk}} to them like that? But I want to thank you and your partner <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of <b>my</b> girl when she went to see the wreck. Fellow on the cars told me--said you were a gritty pup!" ...|$|R
30|$|The biggest {{saying is}} you’re the man. It’s the money but it’s also identity, who you are, your status, your values, {{integrity}} you know, …if I’m caught gambling, {{trying to put}} money on the – try to win money – I don’t try to win the money just <b>for</b> me. I’m <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> family and everything on my shoulder…so when I put money there, it’s to win the money for my family. You imagine that I lose that amount of money and I’ve {{ended up in a}} very devastating status, the amount of shame.|$|R
6000|$|They {{had heard}} of me. In the few days in which I {{had been with the}} Larramies, Miss Willoughby had written of me. They insisted that I should stay to supper, for what good reason could there be <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>taking</b> that meal at the hotel--not a very good one--when they would be so glad to have me sup with them and talk about our mutual friends? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a miserable}} fool I was!" [...] said he. [...] "I {{might have had}} that very ticket. He as good as offered to {{exchange}} with me. Such a stupid dolt as I was, not to know when it was upside down! Then, besides, I was offered two pounds for my ticket, sure--and I believe I should have taken it, if my father had not advised me not to do it. That would have come to almost fifteen dollars, and that I should have been sure of. So much <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> father's advice. I hope they'll get up another lottery to-morrow, and then I'll buy a ticket and do just as I please with it, and not take any body's advice. I shall be sure to make fifteen dollars, at least, if I don't do any better than I might have done to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My child," [...] {{she said}} to Cicely, [...] "I am about to put my life into thy keeping and that of this Talbot lad. If what he saith of this Langston be sooth, I am again betrayed, fool that I was to expect aught else. My life is spent in being betrayed. The fellow hath been a go-between in all that hath passed between Babington and me. If he hath uttered it to Walsingham, all is over with our hopes, and the window in whose {{sunlight}} I have been basking is closed for ever! But something may yet be saved. Something? What do I say?--The letters I hold here would give colour <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> life, ay, and Babington's and Curll's, and many more. I trusted to have burnt them, but in this summer time there is no coming by fire or candle without suspicion, and if I tore them they might be pieced together, nay, and with addition. They must be carried forth and made away with beyond the ken of Paulett and his spies. Now, this lad hath some bowels of compassion and generous indignation. Thou wilt see him again, alone and unsuspected, ere he departs. Thou must deal with him to bear this packet away, and when he is far out of reach to drop it into the most glowing fire, or the deepest pool he can find. Tell him it may concern thy life and liberty, and he will do it, but be not simple enough to say ought of Babington." ...|$|E
60|$|And here it may, perhaps, {{divert the}} curious reader, {{to give some}} account of my domestics, and my manner of living in this country, during a {{residence}} of nine months, and thirteen days. Having a head mechanically turned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had made for myself a table and chair convenient enough, out of the largest trees in the royal park. Two hundred sempstresses were employed to make me shirts, and linen for my bed and table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind they could get; which, however, {{they were forced to}} quilt together in several folds, for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn. Their linen is usually three inches wide, and three feet make a piece. The sempstresses took my measure as I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and another at my mid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the end, while a third measured the length of the cord with a rule of an inch long. Then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a mathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the wrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the help of my old shirt, which I displayed on the ground before them for a pattern, they fitted me exactly. Three hundred tailors were employed in the same manner to make me clothes; but they had another contrivance <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> measure. I kneeled down, and they raised a ladder from the ground to my neck; upon this ladder one of them mounted, and let fall a plumb-line from my collar to the floor, which just answered the length of my coat: but my waist and arms I measured myself. When my clothes were finished, which was done in my house (for the largest of theirs {{would not have been able}} to hold them), they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in England, only that mine were all of a colour.|$|E
60|$|At {{the time}} when I formed the plan which I have the honor to {{transmit}} to you, an abolition {{of the slave trade}} would have appeared a very chimerical project. My plan, therefore, supposes the continued existence of that commerce. <b>Taking</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> basis that I had an incurable evil to deal with, I cast about how I should make it as small an evil as possible, and draw out of it some collateral good.|$|R
6000|$|But Albinia {{was already}} exclaiming, 'Here's a {{champion}} {{wanting to do}} battle with Louisa Osborn in our cause. Oh, Edmund! our neighbours could find no way of accounting <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>taking</b> French leave, but by supposing that I took advantage of being shut in there, while poor little Maurice was squalling so furiously, to rifle your secrets, and detect something so shocking, that away I was fleeing to William in Canada.' ...|$|R
60|$|Gosse has writ {{to offer}} me £40 for a Christmas number ghost {{story for the}} Pall Mall: eight {{thousand}} words. I have, with some conditions, accepted; I pray Heaven I {{may be able to}} do it. But I am not sure that my incapacity to work is wholly due to illness; I believe the morphine I have been <b>taking</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> bray may have a hand in it. It moderates the bray, but, I think, sews up the donkey.|$|R
