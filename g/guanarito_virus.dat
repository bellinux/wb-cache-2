40|$|AbstractSabiá virus, {{one of five}} arenaviruses from South America {{known to}} cause hemorrhagic fever in humans, emerged in 1990 when it was {{isolated}} from a fatal case in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Subsequently, it has caused two laboratory-acquired infections. Its natural distribution and host are still unknown. Using viral RNA and multiple polymerase chain reaction products as templates, the nucleotide sequence of the small (S) RNA segment of Sabiá virus, which codes for the nucleocapsid (N) and glycoprotein precursor, was determined. This virus shares an ambisense genome in common with other arenaviruses, although it has a unique predicted three stem–loop structure in the S RNA intergenic region. Phylogenetic analysis of {{a portion of the}} N gene sequence confirmed that Sabiá virus is distinct from all other members of the Arenaviridae and shares a progenitor with Junin, Machupo, Tacaribe, and <b>Guanarito</b> <b>viruses...</b>|$|R
50|$|Later {{that decade}} while at YARU, he characterised novel arboviruses from birds in Egypt. In 1969, his {{research}} turned to outbreaks of Lassa and yellow fever in Nigeria. The following year, with Frederick A. Murphy, he discovered Duvenhage, Lagos bat and Mokola viruses, {{which were the}} first viruses shown {{to be related to}} rabies. He characterised Thottapalayam virus, later shown to be the first hantavirus, from an Indian shrew in 1971. With Murphy and others, he discovered multiple viruses related to bluetongue, including bluetongue 20 virus, the first bluetongue-like virus from Australia. In the late 1970s, with Jim Meegan, he showed that Rift Valley fever virus - previously believed to be restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, and mainly to infect livestock - was the cause of an epidemic in Egypt in which around 200,000 people were infected. With Allan Steer, {{he was the first to}} describe Lyme disease, a tick-borne bacterial disease, in the US. He subsequently worked on viral hemorrhagic fevers, discovering Sabiá and <b>Guanarito</b> <b>viruses,</b> the causative agents of Brazilian and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fevers. He also researched dengue and its vaccines.|$|R
50|$|Arenaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, bisegmented RNA viruses with {{antisense}} genomes. Based {{on their}} antigenic properties, arenaviruses have been classified into two major groups: the Old World arena viruses, and the New World arenaviruses. Old World arena viruses include lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and Lassa virus. New world arena viruses are further {{broken down into}} three clades, A, B, and C. The <b>Guanarito</b> arena <b>virus</b> belongs to clade B and {{is the cause of}} VHF. On the biosafety level scale of one to four, with four causing the most risk, the viruses causing hemorrhagic fevers have been assigned a four by the CDC.|$|R
50|$|Brazilian {{hemorrhagic fever}} (BzHF) is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} Sabiá virus, an Arenavirus. The Sabiá virus {{is one of the}} arenoviruses from South America to cause hemorrhagic fever. It shares a common progenitor with the Junin virus, Machupo virus, Tacaribe virus, and <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus.</b> It is an enveloped RNA virus and is highly infectious and lethal. Very little is known about this disease, but it is thought to have be transmitted by the excreta of rodents.|$|E
50|$|An arenavirus is a virus {{which is}} a member of the family Arenaviridae. These viruses infect rodents and {{occasionally}} humans; arenaviruses have also been discovered which infect snakes. At least eight arenaviruses are known to cause human disease. The diseases derived from arenaviruses range in severity. Aseptic meningitis, a severe human disease that causes inflammation covering the brain and spinal cord, can arise from the Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. Hemorrhagic fever syndromes are derived from infections such as <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> (GTOV), Junin virus (JUNV), Lassa virus (LASV), Lujo virus (LUJV), Machupo virus (MACV), Sabia virus (SABV), or Whitewater Arroyo virus (WWAV). Arenaviruses are divided into two groups: the Old World and the New World viruses. The differences between these groups are distinguished geographically and genetically. Because of the epidemiological association with rodents, some arenaviruses and bunyaviruses are designated as roboviruses.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} {{analyses}} of Z, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, glycoprotein precursor, and nucleocapsid protein gene sequence data suggested that <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> {{was the most common}} cause of Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever in a 7 -year period in the 1990 s and that the evolution of Pirital virus in association with Sigmodon alstoni (Alston's cotton rat) has occurred at a significantly higher rate than the evolution of <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> in association with Zygodontomys brevicauda (short-tailed cane mouse) on the plains of western Venezuela. The {{results of analyses}} of the primary structures of the glycoproteins of the 8 strains of <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> isolated from humans suggested that these strains would be highly cross-reactive in neutralization assays.

40|$|UnrestrictedFive arenaviruses {{can cause}} hemorrhagic fever in humans. They are {{classified}} by the CDC as category A pathogens {{because of the}} possibility to be manipulated into biological weapons. Of interest, the New World clade B group of the arenaviruses contains both pathogenic and non-pathogenic members, including the closely related Amapari (AMAV) and <b>Guanarito</b> (GTOV) <b>viruses.</b> In our recent study, we determined that pathogenic viruses have a specific tropism {{and are able to}} transduce human T-lymphocytes and use the human transferrin receptor 1 for cell entry. By dividing the GP 1 protein, the subunit that promotes cell binding and entry, into five domains based upon conserved cysteine residues, we generated a series of AMAV and GTOV chimeras to map the region of the GP 1 subunit that correlates to pathogenic tropism. We have found a valine in the domain five of the GTOV GP 1 that is necessary for pathogenic tropism in arenavirus...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} New World arenaviruses (Junín [JUNV], Machupo [MACV], and <b>Guanarito</b> [GTOV] <b>viruses)</b> can cause human disease ranging from mild febrile illness to a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever syndrome. These highly {{pathogenic}} viruses and the Old World Lassa fever virus pose a significant threat {{to public health}} and national security. The only licensed antiviral agent with activity against these viruses, ribavirin, has had mixed success in treating severe arenaviral disease and is associated with significant toxicities. A novel pyrazine derivative currently in clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} influenza virus infections, T- 705 (favipiravir), has demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against a number of RNA viruses, including arenaviruses. T- 705 has also been shown to be effective against Pichinde arenavirus infection in a hamster model. Here, we demonstrate the robust antiviral activity of T- 705 against authentic highly pathogenic arenaviruses in cell culture. We show that T- 705 disrupts an early or intermediate stage in viral replication, distinct from absorption or release, and that its antiviral activity in cell culture is reversed by the addition of purine bases and nucleosides, but not with pyrimidines. Specific inhibition of viral replication/transcription by T- 705 was demonstrated using a lymphocytic choriomeningitis arenavirus replicon system. Our findings indicate that T- 705 acts to inhibit arenavirus replication/transcription and may directly target the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo date, the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses {{recognizes that}} the family {{contains}} a unique genus that includes 22 viral species. There are 9 additional arenaviruses that either have been discovered recently, or which taxonomic status remains pending. Arenaviruses have been classified according to their antigenic properties into two groups, the Lassa-Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) serocomplex and the Tacaribe serocomplex which has been further divided into four evolutionary lineages. Each arenavirus {{is more or less}} tightly associated with a mammal host. The distribution of the host dictates the distribution of the virus. Humans may become infected by arenaviruses through direct contact with infected rodents, including bites, or through inhalation of infectious rodent excreta and secreta. Lassa, Junin, Machupo, <b>Guanarito,</b> and Sabia <b>viruses</b> are known to cause a severe hemorrhagic fever, in western Africa, Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Brazil, respectively. Infection by LCM virus can result in acute central nervous system disease, congenital malformations, and infection in organ transplantation recipients. Detection of arenaviruses in their animal host can be achieved by virus isolation, and has recently taken advantage of PCR-based techniques.

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to elucidate the natural rodent host relationships of Guanarito and Pirital viruses (family Arenaviridae) in the plains of central Venezuela. Ninety-two arenavirus isolates from 607 animals, representing 10 different rodent species, were characterized to the level of serotype. The 92 isolates comprised 19 <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> strains and 73 Pirital virus strains. The 19 <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> isolates were from Zygodontomys brevicauda; 72 (98. 6 %) of the 73 Pirital virus isolates were from Sigmodon alstoni. These results indicate that the natural rodent associations of these 2 sympatric arenaviruses are highly specific and that Z. brevicauda and S. alstoni are the principal rodent hosts of Guanarito and Pirital viruses, respectively. Guanarito (GTO) virus (family Arenaviridae) is the etiologic agent of Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever (VHF), a rodent-borne zoonosis that is endemic in the plains of central Venezuela. 1, 2 In the first large-scale study on the epidemiology of VHF, 3 31 arenavirus isolates (all presumed to be strains of GTO virus) were recovered from 206 wild rodents collected in 1992 from the Municipality of Guanarito, State of Portuguesa.

40|$|Samples from rodents {{captured}} {{on a farm}} in Venezuela in February 1997 were tested for arenavirus, antibody against <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> (GTOV), and antibody against Pirital virus (PIRV). Thirty-one (48. 4 %) of 64 short-tailed cane mice (Zygodontomys brevicauda) were infected with GTOV, 1 Alston’s cotton rat (Sigmodon alstoni) was infected with GTOV, and 36 (64. 3 %) of 56 other Alston’s cotton rats were infected with PIRV. The results of analyses of fi eld and laboratory data suggested that horizontal transmission is the dominant mode of GTOV transmission in Z. brevicauda mice and that vertical transmission is an important mode of PIRV transmission in S. alstoni rats. The results also suggested that bodily secretions and excretions from most GTOV-infected short-tailed cane mice and most PIRVinfected Alston’s cotton rats may transmit the viruses to humans. The Tacaribe serocomplex viruses (family Arenaviridae, genus Arenavirus) known to occur in Venezuela are <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> (GTOV) and Pirital virus (PIRV) (1, 2). GTOV is the etiologic agent of Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever (VHF) (1). The human health significance of PIRV has not been rigorously investigated (3).

Efficient cleavage of <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> GP, whose protease recognition sites deviate from the reported S 1 P consensus sequence, indicates a broader specificity of S 1 P than anticipated. Lack of GP processing of Junin virus dramatically reduced production of infectious virus and prevented cell-to-cell propagation.

In this study, we produced three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of JUNV, designated C 6 - 9, C 11 - 12, and E 4 - 2. The specificity of these MAbs was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence assay, and an epitope-mapping method.

30|$|Lassa virus (LASV) {{belongs to}} the Mammarenavirus genus, Arenaviridae family. Arenaviruses are {{classified}} into two main groups—Old World (OW) and New World (NW)—based on virus genetics, serology, antigenic properties and geographical relationships. The OW LASV and Lujo virus (LUJV), as well as NW Junín virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> (GTOV), Sabiá virus (SABV) and Chapare virus (CHAPV), are known to cause severe hemorrhagic fever and are listed as biosafety level 4 (BSL- 4) agents. The arenavirus glycoprotein complex (GPC) contains three subunits—the retained stable-signal peptide (SSP), the receptor-binding subunit GP 1, and the membrane fusion subunit GP 2 (Lenz et al., 2001). Notably, the proximate external membrane region and TM of GP 2, together with the ectodomain loop and TMs of SSP, form an SSP-GP 2 interface, playing essential roles in regulating membrane fusion, and providing targets for distinct fusion inhibitors (Larson et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008; York et al., 2008; York and Nunberg, 2009; Thomas et al., 2011; Burgeson et al., 2013 a; Shankar et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018).|$|E
40|$|Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a {{group of}} {{infectious}} diseases with similar symptoms in people; the causative viruses affect the vascular system and can produce a severe multisystemic illness in some patients. Arenaviruses known to cause VHF include Lassa virus (Lassa fever), Junin virus (Argentine hemorrhagic fever), Machupo and Chapare viruses (Bolivian hemorrhagic fever), <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> (Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever), Sabia virus and Lujo virus. Some of the causative arenaviruses have probably not been identified yet; the South American arenaviruses emerged as agents of VHF within the last 60 years, and Lujo virus was discovered in Africa in 2008. Arenavirus-associated VHFs are zoonotic diseases, with humans acting as accidental hosts. The viruses are carried in asymptomatic animal reservoirs, typically rodents.

40|$|The retinoic acid-inducible gene I product (RIG-I) is a {{cellular}} sensor of RNA virus infection that regulates the cellular beta interferon (IFN-) response. The nucleoproteins (NP) of arenaviruses {{are reported to}} antagonize the IFN response by inhibiting interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF- 3). Here, we demonstrate that the Z proteins of four New World (NW) arenaviruses, <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> (GTOV), Junin virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MAVC), and Sabia virus (SABV), bind to RIG-I, resulting in downregulation of the IFN- response. We show that expression of the four NW arenavirus Z proteins inhibits IFN- mRNA induction in A 549 cells in response to RNA bearing 5 phosphates (5 pppRNA). NW arenavirus Z proteins interact with RIG-I in coimmunoprecipitation studies and colocalize with RIG-I. Furthermore, expression of Z proteins interferes with the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS. Z expression also impedes the nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) and IRF- 3 activation. Our results indicate that NW arenavirus Z proteins, but not Z protein of the Old World (OW) arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or Lassa virus, bind to RIG-I and inhibit downstream activation of the RIG-I signaling pathway, preventing the transcriptional induction of IFN-.

40|$|Several {{members of}} the Arenaviridae can cause acute febrile {{diseases}} in humans, often resulting in lethality. The use of convalescent-phase human plasma is an effective treatment in humans infected with arenaviruses, particularly species found in South America. Despite this, little work has focused on developing potent and defined immunotherapeutics against arenaviruses. In the present study, we produced arenavirus neutralizing antibodies by DNA vaccination of rabbits with plasmids encoding the full-length glycoprotein precursors of Junín virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), and <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> (GTOV). Geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers, {{as measured by the}} 50 % plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT 50), exceeded 5, 000 against homologous viruses. Antisera against each targeted virus exhibited limited cross-species binding and, to a lesser extent, cross-neutralization. Anti-JUNV glycoprotein rabbit antiserum protected Hartley guinea pigs from lethal intraperitoneal infection with JUNV strain Romero when the antiserum was administered 2 days after challenge and provided some protection (∼ 30 %) when administered 4 days after challenge. Treatment starting on day 6 did not protect animals. We further formulated an IgG antibody cocktail by combining anti-JUNV, -MACV, and -GTOV antibodies produced in DNA-vaccinated rabbits. This cocktail protected 100 % of guinea pigs against JUNV and GTOV lethal disease. We then expanded on this cocktail approach by simultaneously vaccinating rabbits with a combination of plasmids encoding glycoproteins from JUNV, MACV, GTOV, and Sabia virus (SABV). Sera collected from rabbits vaccinated with the combination vaccine neutralized all four targets.

40|$|Dystroglycan (-DG) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a major receptor for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Lassa virus, two Old World arenaviruses. The situation with New World arenaviruses is less clear: previous studies demonstrated that Oliveros virus also exhibited high-affinity binding to -DG but that <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> did not. To extend these initial studies, several additional Old and New World arenaviruses were screened for entry into mouse embryonic stem cells possessing or lacking -DG. In addition, represen-tative viruses were further analyzed for direct binding to -DG by means of a virus overlay protein blot assay technique. These studies indicate that Old World arenaviruses use -DG as a major receptor, whereas, of the New World arenaviruses, only clade C viruses (i. e., Oliveros and Latino viruses) use -DG as a major receptor. New World clade A and B arenaviruses, which include the highly pathogenic Machupo, Guanarito, Junin, and Sabia viruses, appear to use a different receptor or coreceptor for binding. Previous studies with LCMV have suggested the need for a small aliphatic amino acid at LCMV GP 1 glycoprotein amino acid position 260 to allow high-affinity binding to -DG. As reported herein, this requirement appears to be broadly applicable to the arenaviruses as determined by more extensive analysis of -DG receptor usage and GP 1 sequences of Old and New World arenaviruses. In addition, GP 1 amino acid position 259 also appears to be important, since all arenaviruses showing high-affinity -DG binding possess a bulky aromatic amino acid (tyrosine or phenylal...|$|E
40|$|The {{infectious}} syndromes {{associated with}} arenaviruses in South America are four: febrile syndrome of viral origin; Haemorrhagic fevers {{with or without}} neurological involvement; Aseptic meningitis and meningo-encephalitis. Among the Arenavirus {{of the new world}} is the Tacaribe complex where the viruses are found: Junín (Argentina), Guanarito (Venezuela), Machupo (Bolivia) and Sabiá (Brazil), which are characterized by hemorrhagic fevers. In Colombia the arenavirus Pichindé was isolated in 1965, from the rodent Oryzomys albigularis, in the valley of Pichindé (Valle del Cauca). This arenavirus produces a persistent infection in its host and is not pathogenic for the man. There is evidence of the circulation of the <b>Guanarito</b> <b>virus</b> in rodents from Córdoba, but there are no cases diagnosed in humans; In Colombia, the genome of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus was detected in the brains of rodents Mus musculus. The diagnosis is based on the knowledge of local epidemiology and the suspicion of a patient with fever in endemic areas, where infections such as malaria, dengue and leptospirosis, sepsis of bacterial origin and rickectomy have been excluded. Virus isolation in the feverish period is the gold standart, but it implies contact with the virus that is highly infectious, which represents a public health problem. Serology has been used for diagnosis, but there is no commercial evidence and only research groups and large public health laboratories have these tests. Most of the patients present a moderate severity, which needs adequate hydration, antipyretics and anti-inflammatories. All patients with severe signs should be aggressively treated.

Cellular immunity, chiefly the CD 8 + T-cell response, plays {{a critical role in}} providing protective immunity following infection with the Old World arenaviruses LASV and LCMV. In the current study, we evaluated whether HLA class I-restricted epitopes that are cross-reactive among pathogenic arenaviruses could be identified for the purpose of developing an epitope-based vaccination approach that would cross-protect against multiple arenaviruses. We were able to identify a panel of HLA-A* 0201 -restricted peptides derived from the same region of the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) of LASV (GPC spanning residues 441 to 449 [GPC 441 - 449]), LCMV (GPC 447 - 455), JUNV (GPC 429 - 437), MACV (GPC 444 - 452), GTOV (GPC 427 - 435), and WWAV (GPC 428 - 436) that displayed high-affinity binding to HLA-A* 0201 and were recognized by CD 8 + T cells in a cross-reactive manner following LCMV infection or peptide immunization of HLA-A* 0201 transgenic mice. Immunization of HLA-A* 0201 mice with the Old World peptide LASV GPC 441 - 449 or LCMV GPC 447 - 455 induced high-avidity CD 8 + T-cell responses that were able to kill syngeneic target cells pulsed with either LASV GPC 441 - 449 or LCMV GPC 447 - 455 in vivo and provided significant protection against viral challenge with LCMV.
