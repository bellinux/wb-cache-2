Higgins explained that Polydor were not going to continue with the group's contract unless he produced songs for the album. He continued, saying that his initial reaction was that he thought he would only be required to produce a couple of songs, however Polydor insisted that he produce the album in its entirety and that they thought only <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> they wanted.

[...] Favreau insisted on having Downey as he repeatedly claimed that Downey would be to Iron Man what Johnny Depp is to the Pirates of the Caribbean series, a lead actor that could both elevate the quality of the film and increase the public's interest in it.

Roberts also revealed that the band initially was in disagreement with Polydor regarding its release as a single, with Sarah Harding adding that all the girls wanted to release [...] "Deadlines & Diets" [...] instead. Kimberley Walsh and Nadine Coyle in particular voiced their disapproval of the single release, Coyle stating it would be [...] "career suicide" [...] and that she thought the group would be known as laughing stocks if the song came out.|$|E

For the lead single from What Will the Neighbours Say?, Polydor presented the band four singles choices, including [...] "The Show", [...] "Wake Me Up", [...] "Graffiti My Soul", and [...] "Androgynous Girls". Although [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] was the preferred choice, it was deemed too hard sounding and the record company didn't want to take the risk, and they also added [...] "Androgynous Girls" [...] as a b-side to the album's second single three months later. [...] "The pressure to come up with singles was, as always, immense.

500|$|The {{following}} year Affleck played a romantic lead in Terrence Malick's experimental drama To the Wonder. Malick, {{a close friend}} of Affleck's godfather, had first met with the actor in the 1990s to offer advice about the plot of Good Will Hunting. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian enjoyed [...] "a performance of dignity and sensitivity," [...] while The New Yorker 's Richard Brody described Affleck as [...] "a solid and muscular performer" [...] who [...] "conveys a sense of thoughtful and willful individuality". Affleck's performance as a poker boss was considered a highlight of the poorly-reviewed thriller Runner Runner (2013). Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times remarked that it was [...] "one killer of a character, and Affleck plays him like a Bach concerto—every note perfectly played." [...] Also in 2013, Affleck hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live for the fifth time since 2000, becoming a member of the Five Timers Club. He then pushed back production on his own directorial project to star as a husband accused of murder in David Fincher's psychological thriller Gone Girl (2014). Fincher cast him partly because <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> it felt like to be misrepresented by tabloid media: [...] "What many people don’t know is that he's crazy smart, but since he doesn’t want that to get awkward, he downplays it. I think he learned how to skate on charm." [...] David Edelstein of New York Magazine noted that Fincher's controlled style of directing had a [...] "remarkable" [...] effect on Affleck's acting: [...] "I never thought I’d write these words, but he carries the movie. He's terrific." [...] Justin Chang of Variety found Affleck [...] "perfectly cast": [...] "It's a tricky turn, requiring a measure of careful underplaying and emotional aloofness, and he nails it completely." [...] In 2015, Affleck and Damon's Project Greenlight was resurrected by HBO for one season.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times {{described}} {{the film as}} being an [...] "extraordinary documentary," [...] and stated that the film was [...] "nothing at all like what" [...] he was expecting to see. Ebert dismissed reports that Jackson was in poor health and was underperforming, stating that the film did not show a [...] "sick and drugged man forcing himself through grueling rehearsals, but a spirit embodied by music" [...] and referred to Jackson's rehearsal performance(s) as having been [...] "something else." [...] Kirt Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film for being [...] "strange yet strangely beguiling" [...] for capturing Jackson in [...] "feverish grips of pure creativity" [...] and stated that while the film presents that audience with a screen filled with everyone ranging from [...] "performers, musicians, choreographers, crew members, craftsmen," [...] she took notice that the film had primarily focused on Jackson. Honeycutt perceived {{based on what he}} had seen from the behind-the-scenes look of rehearsals that <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> it takes to [...] "attain such dizzying heights in entertainment" [...] and that he understood why Jackson [...] "chose to stay away" [...] from performing [...] "for a decade" [...] and, based on what he saw from footage from rehearsals that it [...] "looks like the world has missed one helluva concert." [...] Honeycutt cited that the only thing that frustrated him more than knowing the [...] "tragedy" [...] that prevented the concert from happening was [...] "not knowing what you're looking at" [...] and commented that the film did not feel like a complete concert film because it had a grip on the audience, stating: [...] "Where are Jackson and his conspirators at any given moment in the creative process? The film tries to be a concert film without having the actual footage. So when everything comes to a halt, audiences get thrown." [...] Peter Travers, of Rolling Stone described watching Jackson's [...] "struggle" [...] as being [...] "illuminating, unnerving and unforgettable" [...] and felt that the film was a great [...] "transcendent tribute" [...] to Jackson because it did not have, nor need, a [...] "safety net." ...|$|E

2500|$|Series creator Alan Ball had {{previously}} {{worked with the}} cable channel HBO on Six Feet Under, which ran for five seasons. In October 2005, after Six Feet Under wrapped, Ball signed a two-year agreement with HBO to develop and produce original programming for the network. True Blood became the first project under the deal, after Ball became acquainted with Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Mystery books. One day, while early for a dental appointment, Ball was browsing through a Barnes & Noble bookshop and came across Dead Until Dark (2001), the first installment in Harris' series. He read the entries that followed and became interested in [...] "bringing [...] vision to television". However, Harris already had two other adaptation options for the books. She said she chose to work with him, though, because [...] " [...] really 'got' me. That's how he convinced {{me to go with}} him.

He lived and died with the audience in his shows, and he gave them something to remember when they left the theater, because he meant every single word of every song as he performed it. Europeans like that. In this jingoistic age of American pride, perhaps we can revisit our own true love of rock and roll by discovering Willy DeVille for the first timeor, at the very least, remember him for what he really was: an American original. The mythos and pathos in his songs, his voice, and his performances were born in these streets and cities and then given to the world who appreciated him much more than we did." ...|$|E

May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We Pakistanis may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{forefront}} of the bowling attack was Ray Lindwall, who became a fast bowler after watching Harold Larwood in 1932-33. His whose smooth run up and perfect delivery produced swing and control and bouncers at a lethal pace, though he dropped the ball short less than Miller. Neville Cardus later wrote that [...] "He has so many brains it's a wonder why he ever went in for fast bowling" [...] and working hand-in-glove with his captain Don Bradman he would think batsman out and catch them in carefully selected field-placings. A. P. Herbert was moved to poetry to describe his bowling action and Trevor Bailey wrote [...] "Watching him bowl {{was one of the most}} satisfying spectacles the game has ever produced". Even so, his arm was thought to be too low (Frank Tyson thought him almost a round-arm bowler) and his long drag could have produced numerous no balls, though he was rarely called for this. His partner Keith Miller had been a batsmen, but in the Victory Tests the Australian Services XI were short of bowlers and Hassett used Miller initially as a change bowler and then gave him the new ball. To everyone's surprise he picked up wickets and soon his strength and natural talent made him into a genuine fast bowler. Bradman knew Australia needed this more than another batsman and encouraged Miller to develop his new talent, though his back injury limited him to short spells. Unlike his new-ball partner Miller liked to drop the ball short and lacked consistency, sometimes bowling leg-breaks or off-spin. Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "The value of Miller's bowling lies wholly and solely in its surprise element. Just when he appears to be well under the control of the batsman he comes to light with a ball that can upset anyone". Together they formed the best fast bowling duo in post-war cricket, perhaps the greatest of any era, and were the spearhead of Australia's success. Ernie Toshack was a left-arm medium pace bowler who bowled with a packed leg-side field and tied up the batsmen when Lindwall and Miller were resting. In the First Test he had the perfect pace to unhinge the English batting on a Brisbane sticky, but failed to understand Bradman's instructions. In the end Bradman took him to the middle, pointed to the spot where he wanted Toshack to bowl, and made him practice alongside the wicket until <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> was required. Once this was done 9 of the last 15 wickets fell to his bowling and Australia won by an innings. Fred Freer was a steady fast-medium swing bowler who liked to drop the ball short and replaced Ray Lindwall in the Second Test when the fast bowler had chickenpox.|$|E
