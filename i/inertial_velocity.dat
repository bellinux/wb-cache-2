In this paper, a double-vortex-ring {{method is adopted}} to generate a three-dimensional microburst wind field. This model incorporates a flight dynamics module and three flight simulations based on various forms of nonlinear equations. In addition, four primary wind gradients are considered to compute the aerodynamic coefficients.

40|$|A novel, {{efficient}} air data {{calibration method}} is proposed for aircraft with limited envelopes. This method uses output-error optimization on three-dimensional <b>inertial</b> <b>velocities</b> to estimate calibration and wind parameters. Calibration parameters {{are based on}} assumed calibration models for static pressure, angle of attack, and flank angle. Estimated wind parameters are the north, east, and down components. The only assumptions needed for this method are that the <b>inertial</b> <b>velocities</b> and Euler angles are accurate, the calibration models are correct, and that the steady-state component of wind is constant throughout the maneuver. A two-minute maneuver was designed to excite the aircraft over the range of air data calibration parameters and de-correlate the angle-of-attack bias from the vertical component of wind. Simulation of the X- 48 B (The Boeing Company, Chicago, Illinois) aircraft was used to validate the method, ultimately using data derived from wind-tunnel testing to simulate the un-calibrated air data measurements. Results from the simulation were accurate and robust to turbulence levels comparable to those observed in flight.

After assuming 2 -D thin-airfoil aerodynamics on the wing sections, it is shown that the equations of motion can be written in canonical state-space form on the intrinsic modal coordinates without any matrix inversion and including only quadratic nonlinearities.

50|$|However, by {{tracking}} {{both the}} current angular {{velocity of the}} system and the current linear acceleration of the system measured relative to the moving system, it is possible to determine the linear acceleration of the system in the inertial reference frame. Performing integration on the inertial accelerations (using the original velocity as the initial conditions) using the correct kinematic equations yields the <b>inertial</b> <b>velocities</b> of the system, and integration again (using the original position as the initial condition) yields the inertial position. In our example, if the blindfolded passenger knew how the car was pointed and what its velocity was before he was blindfolded, and if they are able to keep track of both how the car has turned and how it has accelerated and decelerated since, they can accurately know the current orientation, position, and velocity of the car at any time.|$|R

The achieved model estimates GPS signals during its outage to virtually aid integration filter to develop more accurate navigation results and overcome updating shortage. Employing mechanized <b>inertial</b> <b>velocities</b> as model candidates, support vector machine (SVM) was proposed to model GPS velocities to provide its estimates for unscented KF updates during GPS denied conditions (Jiang et al. 2013; Xu et al. 2012). SVM has been used widely as a regression algorithm for both linear and nonlinear modeling but this approach neglects that the filter is derived by errors which {{may lead to a}} growth of the overall system errors. SVM is able to define a model based on small training data (Xu et al. 2012) with little training time and hence it is suitable for real time implementation. It shows robustness against overfitting problems (Jiang et al. 2013) and does not need priori knowledge of the noise model.|$|R

Each UAV is modeled as a constant-speed particle {{moving in a}} plane, equipped with steering control and a downward-looking intruder sensor. The feedback framework enables a UAV team flying in a steady, uniform wind to (1) cooperatively patrol a convex perimeter and (2) optimally prosecute intruder alerts. The coordination of patrolling UAVs minimizes coverage gaps in space and time. Each intruder alert is prosecuted by a nearby UAV on a time-optimal path that minimizes response time. After passing over an alert site, the prosecuting UAV resumes the coordinated patrol. This algorithm provides continuous monitoring of a base perimeter and prompt response to intruder alerts with minimal human intervention.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a procedure to construct 1 -D geometrically-nonlinear structural dynamics models from built-up 3 -D linear finite-element solutions. The non-linear 1 -D model {{is based on}} an intrinsic form of the equations of motion, which uses sectional <b>inertial</b> <b>velocities</b> and stress resultants as primary degrees of freedom. It is further written in modal coordinates, which yields an finite-dimensional approximation of the geometrically-exact beam dynamics through ordinary differential equations with quadratic nonlinearities. We show that the evaluation of the coefficients in the resulting equations of motion does not actually require the generation of a finite-element model with beam elements. Instead, they are directly identified in the 3 -D model through a process of static condensation on nodes defined along spanwise stations, as it is typically done in aircraft dynamic load analysis. In fact, the method exploits the multi-point constraints of linear load models that are normally used to obtain sectional loads. We illustrate the approach on simple aircraft-type structures modelled using shell elements. NOMENCLATURE C(s) cross-sectional compliance matri...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a semi-active device for the reduction of mechanical structure vibration through energy dissipation by dry friction contact surfaces. The prototype presented incorporates two piezoelectric stack actuators used to apply a normal force between a mobile inertial component and two friction pads. This force is controlled so that the distance between the two surfaces is neither too small (to avoid shock and stiction that can cancel the slip between the two surfaces and then the friction effect) or too large (loss of contact surfaces). Second order mass-spring-damper system is adopted as friction device dynamic model and LuGre friction model as friction force model. So, semi-active friction device characteristics, friction model parameters and stack actuator characteristics are experimentally identified. Two control strategies are used in order to maximize the energy dissipated by the device. The first one is the Lyapunov method leading to the nonlinear bang-bang controller law, and the second is the feedback linearization approach leading to the derivative feedback gain controller equivalent with the viscous friction. Both bang-bang and feedback linearization controllers laws are based on the mobile <b>inertial</b> component <b>velocity</b> for piezoelectric stack actuators command signal synthesis. A compensator, consisting of a filter with narrow band and a dephasor of the mobile <b>inertial</b> component <b>velocity</b> is used to compensate delays of the closed-loop scheme and {{in order to keep the}} fundamental sine in the excitation force. The approaches are experimentally assessed using a clamped-free beam with semiactive device attached to the beam. The experimental control results show the influence of controller laws parameters on the energy dissipation and the vibration of the beam. Optimal controller parameters lead to a gain on energy dissipation in comparison with the case where the normal force is constant. An improper choice of controller parameter can lead to the instability of the piezoelectric stack actuators command signal. That issue is solved by a proper choice of the parameters for the compensator on the mobile <b>inertial</b> component <b>velocity...</b>|$|R

This paper discusses {{the development of an}} optimal state estimator for sensing <b>inertial</b> <b>velocity</b> using low-cost micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors. A low-bandwidth gyroscope is used alone with two low-performance accelerometers to obtain the estimation.

The accelerometers have inherent biases and mainly contribute to the high-frequency components of the estimation. Extensive experimental results show that the state estimator can achieve high-performance signals over a wide range of velocities without drifts in both the t- and s-domains. Furthermore, with applications in miniature inertially stabilized platforms, the control characteristic presents a significantly improvement over the existing methods.
