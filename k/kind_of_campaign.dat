40|$|Ozone {{levels in}} {{southern}} European {{countries have been}} particularly high in last Summers. New European legislation will enter into force obliging Member States to develop abatement measures in case of alert thresholds exceedances. Therefore, {{it is crucial to}} implement an effective air quality assessment, {{in order to ensure that}} abatement measures are successful. In this context, several diffusive sampling campaigns were performed, aiming both to complement monitoring stations results and to analyze distribution patterns under different meteorological conditions. Different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>campaigns</b> took place: two at national level, and two at a regional level. Passive samplers were exposed during one-week period. In the case <b>of</b> the national <b>campaigns</b> samplers were distributed throughout background locations only while in the second set <b>of</b> <b>campaigns</b> tubes were exposed in all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> locations. In parallel with these measurements, 5 -years datasets from the official air quality monitoring network were used in order to establish trends and correlations with meteorological parameters such as temperature, global solar radiation, wind directions, and wind velocities. Several statistical analyses such as principal component analysis were performed, particularly for interpreting peak episodes. Passive samplers results pointed out very high average levels situated far from the coast, where no monitoring network currently exists. The statistical analyses focused particularly for the Lisbon area. Preliminary results show the strongest correlation between temperature and ozone levels...|$|R

50|$|W. Lance Bennett also {{highlights}} the agility provided by technology in his exploration of digital social movements. Bennett interprets ideas of transnational advocacy developed by Keck & Sikkink and places {{them in the}} context of a world with low information costs, and high state consolidation. “Large-scale transnational activism, framed loosely around social justice issues, has displayed remarkable organizational capacities in recent years to wage sustained protests against corporations and transnational organizations at the core of global economic trade and development.” Bennett observes that in the digital age, transnational protests have begun to exhibit a movement toward (1) inclusive organization models, (2) social technologies that allow for decentralized, networked activism, and (3) the leveraging of political capabilities of network members to form effective relationships with targets. Inclusive organization models allow organizations greater fluid movement between issues and targets without being restrained by limited ideologies that restrict collaboration. The ability to easily slide between issues leads to a proliferation <b>of</b> multi-issue <b>campaigns</b> and allegiances with different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> organizations and groups. The utilization of social technologies combines online and offline relationships to establish trust, credibility and loyalty among participants at the individual level.|$|R

40|$|We model {{political}} campaigns as a costly information structure in a two-type signaling game. A candidate’s type consists of private {{information about his}} own qualifications and that about his rival, and chooses both the target {{and the level of}} an information campaign, with a higher positive (negative) campaign generating a more accurate public signal about his (the rival’s) qualifications. We consider both the expected-margin payoff structure, where the candidate’s payoff depends on the difference in the median voter’s posterior beliefs about himself and about the rival, and the winner-take-all payoff structure. Under both payoff structures, the high-type candidate has favorable information about his own qualifications and/or unfavorable information about his rival. Under expected-margin, the high type chooses the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> that he has relative advantage in to separate from the low type. The required separating level is higher when the relative advantage is smaller. Under winner-takeall, separation can occur only through different kinds of campaign. The required separating level is independent of the high type’s private information, and is higher when the low type has a weaker preference between positive and negative campaigns...|$|E

40|$|Different times {{call for}} a {{different}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>campaign</b> strategy John Hewson wanted to run a totally positive election campaign. But when he put it to a vote of his shadow cabinet, he found himself the lone supporter. The Liberal Party went ahead with negative television advertisements and Hewson spent the last weeks of the 1993 campaign at rowdy rallies, spruiking his Fightback! policies. In the dying days of the campaign, amid a light shower of squishy foodstuffs, Hewson had “the catch of the series”: an egg on the fly, just before it could splatter all over his white shirt. Hewson saved the egg but lost the election, and the Coalition joined the Labor Party in its less-is-more approach to campaigning. Policy as political communication, which had broadly defined the Liberal Party’s approach between 1985 and 1993, was largely abandoned by both sides. That kind of detail wasn’t the way to win elections; it exposed oppositions needlessly to the scrutiny {{of the media and}} the vast resources of government. Despite the rise of small-target strategies, though, oppositions still liked to boast that they have “the most comprehensive policy plan in living memory,” often with little evidence and a lot of wilful ignorance of their own party’s history.
