5|$|The primary food of Galapagos {{sharks are}} benthic bony fishes (including eels, sea bass, flatfish, flatheads, and triggerfish) and octopuses. They also {{occasionally}} take surface-dwelling prey such as mackerel, flyingfish, and squid. As the sharks grow larger, they consume {{increasing numbers of}} <b>elasmobranchs</b> (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage. At the Galapagos Islands, this species has been observed attacking Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), and marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). While collecting fishes at Clipperton Island, Limbaugh (1963) noted that juvenile Galapagos sharks surrounded the boat, with multiple individuals rushing at virtually anything trailing {{in the water and}} striking the boat bottom, oars, and marker buoys. The sharks were not slowed by rotenone (a fish toxin) or shark repellent, and some followed the boat into water so shallow that their backs were exposed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Elasmobranch</b> {{populations are}} declining worldwide, calling for urgent {{assessment}} of fishery exploitation {{and application of}} effective conservation strategies. Here, we applied a novel approach, integrating long-term time-series of landings (1945 – 2012) and extensive surveys at the fishmarket of Chioggia, Italy, home of themajor fishing fleet of the northern Adriatic Sea, to evaluate the status of <b>elasmobranch</b> populations and fisheries in {{the one of the}} most fished Mediterranean basins. The time-series highlight a dramatic decline in <b>elasmobranch</b> landings, particularly for skates and catsharks (Scyliorhinus spp.), whose current catch rates are 2. 4 and 10. 6...|$|R
25|$|Because {{the common}} skate is {{long-lived}} and slow to mature, {{it is difficult}} for it to repopulate quickly. Coupled with overfishing, this means that the common skate's population has drastically decreased and it is likely it will disappear entirely unless more is done to preserve it. It is strictly protected within the EU, making it illegal for commercial fishers to actively fish for it or keep it if accidentally landed. Like other <b>elasmobranchs,</b> it is believed to {{have a good chance of}} surviving if released after being caught.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{alimentary}} {{system of}} Bothriolepis –which includes the organs involved in ingestion, digestion and removal of waste– {{can be described}} as simple and straight, unlike that of humans. It begins at the anterior end of the organism with a small mouth cavity located over the posterior area of the upper jaw plates. Posteriorly from the mouth, the alimentary system extends into a wider and dorso-ventrally flattened region called the pharynx, from which both the gills and lungs arise. The esophagus, which is also characterized as a dorso-ventrally flattened tube, extends from the mouth into the stomach and leads to a flattened ellipsoidal structure. This structure may be homologous to the anterior end of the intestine found in other fish. It must be noted that the flatness of these structures may have been exaggerated when the fossil specimens experienced tectonic deformation through geologic time. The intestine begins narrowly on the anterior end, expands transversely and then again narrows posteriorly towards the cylindrical rectum, which terminates just within the posterior end of the trunk carapace. While the alimentary system is primitive in nature and lacks an expanded stomach region, it is specialized by an independently acquired complex spiral valve, comparable to that in <b>elasmobranchs</b> and many bony fish and similar to that found in some sharks. A single fold of tissue rolled upon its own axis forms this specialized spiral valve.|$|E
25|$|A common predatory {{technique}} {{that has been}} observed among benthic <b>elasmobranchs</b> is ambushing behavior. As it pertains to rays, skates, carpet sharks, and angel sharks, the predator searches for suitable hiding environments such as sand, pebbles, coral, or algae that match its coloration or patterning, which {{is also known as}} aggressive mimicry. Ambushing is a behavior in which a predator relies on its coloring, body structure, or the environment as an advantage in concealing itself while waiting on unsuspecting prey to enter its striking range. There have been recorded occasions where this form of ambushing behavior of stingrays and related benthic sharks has been directed towards a common prey type. One example of this occasion involves the chokka squid, (Loligo vulgaris reynaudii), which spawns in the inshore coastal habitats around South Africa. The diamond ray (Gymnura natalensis) frequently relies on aggressive mimicry as it blends into sandy habitats waiting for preoccupied female chokka squids who are busy spawning. Diamond rays then shoot off from the bottom substrates and use suction feeding to ingest the spawning squids and their eggs. Suction feeding works in conjunction and is aided by ram filter feeding, which is demonstrated by pelagic rays including the manta ray (Manta birostris) and the closely related devil rays (Mobula sp.). Many of the pelagic rays have external mouth structures called cephalic lobes that assist in siphoning in water and planktonic organisms as the rays swim in acrobatic patterns in these patches of food. A stingray's diet includes small fish, snails, clams, and shrimp, and some other small sea creatures.|$|E

25|$|Elasmobranchs' {{ability to}} enter fresh water is limited because their blood is {{normally}} {{at least as}} salty (in terms of osmotic strength) as seawater through the accumulation of urea and trimethylamine oxide, but bull sharks living in fresh water show a significantly reduced concentration of urea within their blood. Despite this, the solute composition (i.e. osmolarity) of a bull shark in fresh water is still much {{higher than that of}} the external environment. This results in a large influx of water across the gills due to osmosis and loss of sodium and chloride from the shark's body. However, bull sharks in fresh water possess several organs with which to maintain appropriate salt and water balance; these are the rectal gland, kidneys, liver, and gills. All <b>elasmobranchs</b> have a rectal gland which functions in the excretion of excess salts accumulated as a consequence of living in seawater. Bull sharks in freshwater environments decrease the salt-excretory activity of the rectal gland, thereby conserving sodium and chloride./K+-ATPase activity in gill, rectal gland, kidney and intestine|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B|year=2005|volume=175 |issue=1 |pages=37–44 |pmid=15565307|url=http://www.sciencecollege.com/sharklab/courses/elasmobiology/readings/pillans.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00360-004-0460-2}} The kidneys produce large amounts of dilute urine, but also {{play an important role in}} the active reabsorption of solutes into the blood. The gills of bull sharks are likely to be involved in the uptake of sodium and chloride from the surrounding fresh water, whereas urea is produced in the liver as required with changes in environmental salinity. Recent work also shows that the differences in density of fresh water to that of marine waters result in significantly greater negative buoyancies in sharks occupying fresh water, resulting in increasing costs of living in fresh water. Bull sharks caught in freshwater have subsequently been shown to have lower liver densities than sharks living in marine waters. This may reduce the added cost of greater negative buoyancy.|$|E

Great whites {{have also been}} known to eat objects that {{they are unable to}} digest. Juvenile white sharks predominantly prey on fish including other <b>elasmobranchs,</b> as their jaws are not strong enough to withstand the forces required to attack larger prey such as pinnipeds and cetaceans until they reach a length of [...] or more, at which point their jaw cartilage mineralizes enough to withstand the impact of biting into larger prey species. Upon approaching a length of nearly , great white sharks begin to target predominately marine mammals for food, though individual sharks seem to specialize in different types of prey depending on their preferences. They seem to be highly opportunistic. These sharks prefer prey with a high content of energy-rich fat.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the longevity and low fecundity of sharks makes them particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation.
