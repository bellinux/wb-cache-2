50|$|Siegmann began carving {{wood in the}} 1970s {{and worked}} with it for about twenty years. In the 1990s, she began to {{experiment}} with metal, working with <b>discarded</b> <b>molds</b> from a local factory along with another artist named Inmaculada Barca. The switch was not only prompted by interest in other materials, but also because she was concerned that her use of wood contributed to deforestation. Since this time she has worked with bronze, steel and paper and more recently with recycled and found materials. Much of her work since the 2000s {{has been working with}} plants and trees, stemming from thoughts about ecology and human survival.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} aims at reutilizing <b>discarded</b> plaster <b>molds</b> {{by using}} waste gypsum obtained from these molds as an inert filler in natural rubber. Its effects on curing characteristics were investigated {{in comparison with}} commercial gypsum and calcium carbonate. These fillers were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer before being mixed with natural rubber at various amounts. Several ingredients necessary for curing via sulfur system were also incorporated. The rubber compounds were then tested for their curing behaviors using a moving die rheometer to investigate {{the effects of the}} fillers. The results show that when filler loadings increased the maximum and minimum torques of the compounds increased accordingly while the scorch time and 90 % cure time steadily decreased. The cure rate index of the NR-filled compounds was clearly affected by the filler especially when commercial and waste gypsums were used...|$|R
5000|$|The Finlandia line of [...] "bark glass" [...] vases {{produced}} by Iittala in 1964-1970 brought about another innovation, mass-produced household objects {{each of which}} was, in a way, exclusive. The collection was distinguished {{by the presence of}} thick glass with a rough surface that brought to mind snow and ice, replacing in one blow the smooth, thin, streamlined colored glass of the 1950s. Sarpaneva recalled:I found a heap of <b>discarded</b> wooden <b>molds</b> used for making polished glass and decided to make a different kind of glass with them. Each piece was slightly different in its shape and surface.Glass was poured or blown into the molds and allowed to remain long enough for the molds to burn, thereby roughening the surfaces. Each time the mold was blown into, the grain texture changed causing each object in the Finlandia series to be unique although mold-blown. The molds were gradually, and intentionally, destroyed through repeated contact with glass heated to 500 Â°C (932 F). The changing surface gave each piece a natural randomized [...] "bark" [...] effect created by the carbonized wood, which could not otherwise be convincingly created by an artist.|$|R
