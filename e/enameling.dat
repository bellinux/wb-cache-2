5|$|The Human Resources and Research and Development {{buildings}} were originally constructed around 1912 by the MacKay Copper Process Company. The property was acquired in 1923 by the Thermos Company following the foreclosure of the MacKay company. The Human Resources building {{was used by}} the <b>enameling</b> department until its conversion in 1948. The Research and Development building was previously the Engineering building. A one-story hipped frame gatehouse was constructed in the 1920s. The Carpenter Shop (Building 62) was constructed in 1926. The Thermos factory completed construction of a storage building in 1929 (Building 2) and another storage building in 1941 (Building 1). Glass House 1 (Building 5) was constructed in 1939 and incorporates a warehouse dating from 1930 into its construction. Glass House 2 was constructed in 1951 and is connected to the Manufacturing Building by a conveyor.|$|E

Kurtas worn on formal occasions might feature decorative metal buttons, {{which are not}} sewn to the fabric, but, like cufflinks, are fastened into the cloth when needed. Such buttons can be decorated with jewels, <b>enameling,</b> and other traditional jewelers' techniques.|$|E

In Jean Dunand's studio his interested turned towards metal panel-beating, <b>enameling</b> and rock-crystals. During {{this time he}} associated with the Paresian avant-garde. Subsequently, Miklos devoted {{most of his time}} to sculpture, a medium in which his style became less convoluted, purist in nature, retaining an element of mystery. Miklos personally supervised the casting of his bronzes and the application of various patinas, so that light would reflect desirably off their surfaces.|$|E

25|$|Charles Street {{begins at}} a dead end one block south of Wells Street in the South Baltimore {{neighborhood}} of Baltimore. The terminus is immediately {{to the north of}} CSX's Locust Point Branch of the Baltimore Terminal Subdivision and I-95 and two blocks {{to the west of the}} historic National <b>Enameling</b> and Stamping Company factory complex. Charles Street heads north as a two-lane street through residential South Baltimore. The street becomes commercial as it passes between the Federal Hill and Sharp Leadenhall neighborhoods. Federal Hill contains the Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church on West Street and the Cross Street Market on the eponymous street. Sharp Leadenhall contains the Little Montgomery Street Historic District. At the north end of the two neighborhoods, Charles Street intersects MD 2, which follows Montgomery Street east and Hughes Street west on its two-block transfer from Hanover Street, which the route follows south toward the Hanover Street Bridge over the Patapsco River, to Light Street at the southwest corner of the Inner Harbor. Charles Street enters the Otterbein neighborhood, where it becomes one-way northbound at Lee Street. At the northern end of the neighborhood, Charles Street intersects Conway Street, a four-block boulevard that passes the Otterbein Church and connects Light Street at the Inner Harbor with I-395 and Howard Street just east of the B Warehouse and Oriole Park at Camden Yards.|$|E
500|$|When {{the company}} began to make watches again in the 1990s it {{produced}} a unique style of watch which incorporated various elements of the pocket watch form in its construction, such as at the lugs, and won awards after its introduction in 1997. [...] Most Bovet watches use this trademark style today. [...] The watches are unique for their high-quality <b>enameling</b> (such as the Fleurier Miniature Painting models), engraving, and a seven-day self-winding tourbillon. [...] Bovet watches are also unique for the company's tradition of employing women artisans, which is rare for traditional watch making companies in Europe. [...] Some of the limited edition modern Bovet watches can cost more than US$1 million, and the purchaser of such a watch is usually flown out to the manufacturing facility in Switzerland by the company to witness the production process and meet the artisans.|$|E
500|$|Censorship during World War One {{included}} {{restrictions on}} sketching and painting around the British coastline. This caused problems for Laura Knight, particularly when painting Spring, which was {{shown at the}} Royal Academy in 1916 but which she later reworked. Also in 1916 Knight received a Â£300 commission to paint a canvas for the Canadian Government War Records office {{on the theme of}} Physical Training in a Camp, and produced a series of paintings of boxing matches at Witley in Surrey. Knight worked with Ella Naper, who was experienced in <b>enameling</b> techniques, to produce a set of small enamel pieces featuring several ballet dancers, which were shown at the Fine Art Society in London in 1915. Special painting and sketching permits available after 1915 allowed Knight to continue her paintings of cliff-top landscapes. Several of these were completed from studies in the Knights' first London studio after the couple moved to the capital in 1919. During the war, in 1916, Harold Knight had registered as a conscientious objector and was eventually required to work as a farm labourer.|$|E

2500|$|In silversmithing or jewelry making, special hard solders {{are used}} that will pass assay. They contain a high {{proportion}} of the metal being soldered and lead is not used in these alloys. These solders vary in hardness, designated as [...] "enameling", [...] "hard", [...] "medium" [...] and [...] "easy". <b>Enameling</b> solder has a high melting point, close to that of the material itself, to prevent the joint desoldering during firing in the <b>enameling</b> process. The remaining solder types are used in decreasing order of hardness during the process of making an item, to prevent a previously soldered seam or joint desoldering while additional sites are soldered. Easy solder is also often used for repair work for the same reason. Flux or rouge is also used to prevent joints from desoldering.|$|E

6000|$|... 114. We may {{pause to}} {{consider}} {{for a moment}} what effect upon the mental habits of these earlier schools might result from this separate and previous completion of minor details. It is to be remembered that the painter's object in the backgrounds of works of this period (universally, or nearly so, of religious subject) was not the deceptive representation of a natural scene, but the adornment and setting forth of the central figures with precious work--the conversion of the picture, as far as might be, into a gem, flushed with color and alive with light. The processes necessary for this purpose were altogether mechanical; and those of stamping and burnishing the gold, and of <b>enameling,</b> were necessarily performed before any delicate tempera-work could be executed. Absolute decision of design was therefore necessary throughout; hard linear separations were unavoidable between the oil-color and the tempera, or between each and the gold or enamel. General harmony of effect, aÃ«rial perspective, or deceptive chiaroscuro, became totally impossible; and {{the dignity of the}} picture depended exclusively on the lines of its design, the purity of its ornaments, and the beauty of expression which could be attained in those portions (the faces and hands) which, set off and framed by this splendor of decoration, became the cynosure of eyes. The painter's entire energy was given to these portions; and we can hardly imagine any discipline more calculated to insure a grand and thoughtful school of art than the necessity of discriminated character and varied expression imposed by this peculiarly separate and prominent treatment of the features. The exquisite drawing of the hand also, at least in outline, remained for this reason even to late periods one of the crowning excellences of the religious schools. It might be worthy the consideration of our present painters whether some disadvantage may not result from the exactly opposite treatment now frequently adopted, the finishing of the head before the addition of its accessories. A flimsy and indolent background is almost a necessary consequence, and probably also a false flesh-color, irrecoverable by any after-opposition.|$|E
