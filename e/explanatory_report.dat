2500|$|In recent decades, {{there has}} been a call for the end of legal {{impunity}} for domestic violence, an impunity often {{based on the idea that}} such acts are private. The Istanbul Convention is the first legally binding instrument in Europe dealing with domestic violence and violence against women. The convention seeks to put an end to the toleration, in law or in practice, of violence against women and DV. In its <b>explanatory</b> <b>report</b> it acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring, de jure or de facto, these forms of violence. At para 219, it states: [...] "There are many examples from past practice in Council of Europe member states that show that exceptions to the prosecution of such cases were made, either in law or in practice, if victim and perpetrator were, for example, married to each other or had been in a relationship. The most prominent example is rape within marriage, which for a long time had not been recognised as rape because of the relationship between victim and perpetrator." ...|$|E

2500|$|To relieve {{bottlenecks}} in {{the subway}} system, a series of major works were {{carried out in the}} 1960s. One of them, the [...] Chrystie Street Connection in Chinatown, Manhattan, had a major impact on the subway map, as it unified the BMT and IND divisions of the subway, thereby rendering obsolete the three-colored network maps that been used since the 1930s. The Transit Authority had to devise a new map design by the time the Chrystie Street Connection opened, so in 1964, they opened the Subway Map Competition to the general public. There were three winners; one of them, R. Raleigh D'Adamo, submitted an <b>explanatory</b> <b>report</b> with his map, which detailed his innovative proposal to color-code the subway by individual routes rather than by historic operating company. This concept was implemented by Dr Stanley Goldstein of Hofstra University, working as a consultant to the TA, and by Dante Calise, art director at Diamond Packaging, the firm that printed the subway map. On November 26, 1967, when the new connections opened, the new map came into use. There was also a map to explain all the newly rerouted services.|$|E

50|$|The Prussian {{government}} {{rejected the}} project on 8 June 1879, as it was first focussing {{on the construction of}} main lines. The <b>explanatory</b> <b>report</b> continued to serve as a template for its possible construction. On 10 May 1880, a railway committee was founded in Bad Oeynhausen to campaign {{for the construction of a}} railway from Osnabrück to Brackwede. It basically adopted the route of the <b>explanatory</b> <b>report,</b> but the line would be able to be extended to Detmold and Bergheim. Eleven people were constantly involved with the railway committee, including Mayor Brüning of Osnabrück and Mayor Huber of Bielefeld. On the very day of the founding of the committee, it wrote a letter to the Royal Ministry of Public Works (Königliche Staatsministerium für öffentliche Arbeiten). In this letter, it again described the necessity of building the railway. The responsible railway administration now endorsed the project but demanded a grant of 10,000 marks per kilometre for the construction of the line. It was subsequently agreed that the payment would be 3,000 marks per km, with the municipalities and companies agreeing to participate in the payment.|$|E

50|$|A railway halt at Breese am Seißelberge {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in August 1869 in an <b>explanatory</b> <b>report</b> about {{preparations for the}} construction of the Wittenberge-Buchholz branch. At the time only a halt was planned - {{and it would have been}} the only one on the line; all the other stopping points were stations. When the construction of the line was already well under way and the opening of the section to Hitzacker was imminent in October 1873, the first designs for a station at Breese were unfolded by the Berlin-Hamburg Railway. It was intended from the outset as the reception station for the emperor's hunting parties and was built in the following year, 1874. The station was ceremonially opened on 26 November 1874 on the occasion of the first visit by the German Emperor.|$|E
