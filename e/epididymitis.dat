25|$|<b>Epididymitis,</b> {{a painful}} {{inflammation}} of the epididymis or epididymides frequently caused by bacterial infection but sometimes of unknown origin.|$|E
25|$|Amiodarone is {{sometimes}} responsible for <b>epididymitis,</b> {{a condition of}} the epididymis, and is normally associated with bacterial infections but which can also occur as a non-bacterial inflammatory condition. Amiodarone accumulates in {{the head of the}} organ and can cause unilateral or bilateral inflammation. It tends to resolve if amiodarone is stopped.|$|E
25|$|In wildlife, {{exposure}} to EDCs {{can result in}} altered fertility, reduced viability of offspring, impaired hormone secretion or activity and modified reproductive anatomy. The reproductive anatomy of offspring can particularly be affected if maternal exposure occurs. In females, this includes mammary glands, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina. In males, this includes the prostate, seminal vesicles, <b>epididymitis</b> and testes. Exposure of fish to EDCs has also been associated with abnormal thyroid function, decreased fertility, decreased hatching success, de-feminization and masculinization of female fish and alteration of immune function.|$|E

50|$|Any form of <b>epididymitis</b> can {{be caused}} by genito-urinary surgery, {{including}} prostatectomy and urinary catheterization. Congestive <b>epididymitis</b> is a long-term complication of vasectomy. Chemical <b>epididymitis</b> may also result from drugs such as amiodarone.|$|E
50|$|Chronic <b>epididymitis</b> is <b>epididymitis</b> that {{is present}} {{for more than}} 3 months. Chronic <b>epididymitis</b> is {{characterized}} by inflammation even {{when there is no}} infection present. Tests are needed to distinguish chronic <b>epididymitis</b> from a range of other disorders that can cause constant scrotal pain including testicular cancer (though this is often painless), enlarged scrotal veins (varicocele), and a possible cyst within the epididymis. Some research has found that as much as 80% of visits to a urologist for scrotal pain are for chronic <b>epididymitis.</b> As a further complication, the nerves in the scrotal area are closely connected to those of the abdomen, sometimes causing abdominal pain similar to a hernia (see referred pain).|$|E
5000|$|It is {{generally}} believed that most cases of chronic <b>epididymitis</b> will eventually [...] "burn out" [...] of patient's system if left untreated, though this might take years or even decades. [...] However, some prostate-related medications have proven effective in treating chronic <b>epididymitis,</b> including doxazosin.|$|E
5000|$|Testicular Pain- Evaluation for {{testicular}} torsion, orchitis, <b>epididymitis,</b> hernia ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of testicular pain is broad and involves conditions from benign to life-threatening. The most common causes {{of pain in}} children presenting {{to the emergency room}} are testicular torsion (16%), torsion of a testicular appendage (46%), and <b>epididymitis</b> (35%). [...] In adults, the most common cause is <b>epididymitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Doxazosin {{has also}} shown some {{efficacy}} in treating chronic <b>epididymitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{symptoms}} are similar to <b>epididymitis</b> though <b>epididymitis</b> may be characterized by discoloration and swelling of the testis, often with fever, while the cremasteric reflex is usually present. Testicular torsion, or more probably impending testicular infarction, can also produce a low-grade fever.There is often an absent or decreased cremasteric reflex.|$|E
50|$|Untreated, acute epididymitis's major {{complications}} are abscess {{formation and}} testicular infarction. Chronic <b>epididymitis</b> {{can lead to}} permanent damage or even destruction of the epididymis and testicle (resulting in infertility and/or hypogonadism), and infection may spread to any other organ or system of the body. Chronic pain is also an associated complication for untreated chronic <b>epididymitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Actinobacillus seminis is a bacterium. It is {{associated}} with <b>epididymitis</b> of sheep.|$|E
50|$|<b>Epididymitis</b> can be {{classified}} as acute, subacute, and chronic, depending on the duration of symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Prehn's sign (named after {{urologist}} Douglas T. Prehn) is {{a medical}} diagnostic indicator that was once believed to help determine whether the presenting testicular pain is caused by acute <b>epididymitis</b> or from testicular torsion. Although elevation of the scrotum when differentiating <b>epididymitis</b> from testicular torsion is of clinical value, Prehn's sign {{has been shown to}} be inferior to Doppler ultrasound to rule out testicular torsion.|$|E
5000|$|The cremaster reflex (elevation of the {{testicle}} {{in response}} to stroking the upper inner thigh) is typically present in <b>epididymitis</b> but absent in testicular torsion as the testis is already elevated. [...] Prehn's sign ( [...] the relief of pain with elevation [...] ) though a classic physical exam finding has not {{been found to be}} reliable in distinguishing torsion from other causes of testicular pain such as <b>epididymitis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Positive Prehn's sign {{indicates}} {{there is}} pain relief with lifting the affected testicle, which points towards <b>epididymitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{inflammation}} of the epididymis is called <b>epididymitis.</b> It is much more common than testicular inflammation, termed orchitis.|$|E
5000|$|... genital ulcers (including anal ulcers and {{spots in}} the genital region and swollen {{testicles}} or <b>epididymitis</b> in men) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Epididymitis,</b> {{a painful}} {{inflammation}} of the epididymis or epididymides frequently caused by bacterial infection but sometimes of unknown origin.|$|E
50|$|According to Prehn's sign, the {{physical}} {{lifting of the}} testicles relieves the pain of <b>epididymitis</b> but not pain caused by testicular torsion.|$|E
50|$|If left untreated, {{complications}} include <b>epididymitis</b> and infertility. Consistent {{and correct}} use of latex condoms during sexual activity greatly reduces {{the likelihood of}} infection.|$|E
50|$|Another way to {{differentiate}} between <b>epididymitis</b> and torsion on physical examination is checking for the cremaster reflex which is absent {{in the case of}} torsion.|$|E
50|$|A doppler {{ultrasound}} {{scan of the}} scrotum is nearly 90% accurate in diagnosis identifying the absence of blood flow in the twisted testicle, which distinguishes torsion from <b>epididymitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The history {{should include}} prior {{testicular}} or penile insults (torsion, cryptorchidism, trauma), infections (mumps orchitis, <b>epididymitis),</b> environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation, medications, {{and drug use}} (anabolic steroids, alcohol, smoking).|$|E
50|$|Up to 20% {{of cases}} can have {{genitourinary}} involvement; orchitis and <b>epididymitis</b> are most common. Neurological symptoms include depression and mental fatigue. Cardiovascular involvement can include endocarditis resulting in death.|$|E
50|$|They {{are also}} {{believed}} {{to result from}} <b>epididymitis,</b> physical trauma, or vasectomy. Scarring of {{any part of the}} epididymis can cause it to become obstructed and in turn form a spermatocele.|$|E
50|$|<b>Epididymitis</b> {{makes up}} 1 in 144 visits {{for medical care}} (0.69 percent) in men 18 to 50 years old or 600,000 cases in males between 18 and 35 in the United States.|$|E
50|$|In children, fluoroquinolones and {{doxycycline}} {{are best}} avoided. Since bacteria that cause urinary tract infections {{are often the}} cause of <b>epididymitis</b> in children, co-trimoxazole or suited penicillins (for example, cephalexin) can be used.|$|E
50|$|Odynorgasmia, or painful ejaculation, is a {{physical}} syndrome described by pain or burning sensation of the urethra or perineum during or following ejaculation. Causes include infections associated with urethritis, prostatitis, <b>epididymitis,</b> as well as use of anti-depressants.|$|E
50|$|Epididymotomy is the placing of an {{incision}} {{into the}} epididymis and is sometimes {{considered as a}} treatment option for acute suppurating epididymitis.Epididymectomy is the surgical removal of the epididymis sometimes performed for post-vasectomy pain syndrome and for refractory cases of <b>epididymitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Extracts of Pulsatilla {{have been}} used to treat {{reproductive}} problems such as premenstrual syndrome and <b>epididymitis.</b> Additional applications of plant extracts include uses as a sedative and for treating coughs. It is also used as an initial ingredient in homeopathic remedies.|$|E
5000|$|Household {{remedies}} such as {{elevation of}} the scrotum and cold compresses applied regularly to the scrotum may relieve the pain in acute cases. Painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs are often used for treatment of both chronic and acute forms. Hospitalisation is indicated for severe cases, and check-ups can ensure the infection has cleared up. Surgical removal of the epididymis is rarely necessary, causes sterility, and only gives relief from pain in approximately 50% of cases. [...] However, in acute suppurating <b>epididymitis</b> (acute <b>epididymitis</b> with a discharge of pus), a epididymotomy may be recommended; in refractory cases, a full epididymectomy may be required. In cases with unrelenting testicular pain, removal of the entire testicle—orchiectomy—may also be warranted.|$|E
50|$|Chlamydia causes {{more than}} 250,000 cases of <b>epididymitis</b> in the U.S. each year. Chlamydia causes 250,000 to 500,000 cases of PID {{every year in}} the United States. Women {{infected}} with chlamydia are up to five times more likely to become infected with HIV, if exposed.|$|E
50|$|Though {{urinary tract}} infections in men are rare, {{bacterial}} infection {{is the most}} common cause of acute <b>epididymitis.</b> The bacteria in the urethra back-track through the urinary and reproductive structures to the epididymis. In rare circumstances, the infection reaches the epididymis via the bloodstream.|$|E
50|$|The {{condition}} can {{be detected}} with sonography. It is commonly associated with epididymal abnormalities, such as spermatocele, epididymal cyst, and <b>epididymitis.</b> The condition shares a common location with cystic dysplasia of the testis and intratesticular cysts. Unlike cystic neoplasms, they don't present specific tumor markers.|$|E
