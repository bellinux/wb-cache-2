5|$|Locomotor {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> Mesopropithecus; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, {{seen in the}} ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus; and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> many of the sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even {{been reported to be}} a good swimmer. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E
5|$|A 1982 {{study of}} {{subjects}} who underwent computer-based visual training concluded that any perceived resulting improvement in visual acuity is best explained as a contact lens-like effect of moisture on the eye, based on increased tear action <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> 15 out of 17 subjects who experienced such improvement.|$|E

5|$|A {{paternity}} {{analysis of}} yellow-faced honeyeater nestlings found that 10 of 18 nestlings were fathered by the male of the nesting pair, with clear evidence for extra-pair paternity {{in the case}} of the remaining 44%. This conflicts with the usual pattern, where genetic monogamy is linked to the characteristics of strong social pairing, essential paternal contributions to brood rearing, and to sexual monomorphism; characteristics <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> the yellow honeyeater.|$|E
5|$|A {{print of}} the film survives in the {{archives}} of the Museum of Modern Art. The complete film as intended for its release is 13 minutes and 39 seconds long. As the original film did not have official musical accompaniment, a new original music score was composed and performed by Ben Model. The film was <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> The Museum of Modern Art on October 29, 2009, it was organized by Charles Silver and film historians Ben Model and Steve Massa. The film was released in Volume 10 of the Thanhouser Collection.|$|E
5|$|Eyes: Kayser–Fleischer rings (KF rings), a {{pathognomonic}} sign, may {{be visible}} in the cornea of the eyes, either directly or on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper in a ring around the cornea. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane. They do not occur in all people with Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Neither cause significant visual loss. KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).|$|E

5|$|Interest in the Volunteer Corps' {{activity}} was only revived after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Among the relics {{left behind by}} the Corps is Dimitrie Lăzărel's banner, probably the only one of seven to have survived. In 1923, Lăzărel paraded it at the Volunteers' Union reunion in Arad. Referred to as the Darnița Banner, it was donated to a local church, then <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> the Museum of Banat, Timișoara. The Kishinev flag was donated by the Corps to ASTRA National Museum Complex of Sibiu.|$|E
5|$|It is {{relatively}} {{difficult to separate}} ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. The solution is then applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to {{the different types of}} bonding <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> the different lanthanides, it is possible to isolate the compounds.|$|E
5|$|Middle Mongol had a {{slightly}} larger set of declarative finite verb suffix forms {{and a smaller}} number of participles, which {{were less likely to be}} used as finite predicates. The linking converb -n became confined to stable verb combinations, while the number of converbs increased. The distinction between male, female and plural subjects <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> some finite verbal suffixes was lost.|$|E

Wells, Irvine Garland Penn, and Ferdinand Lee Barnet coauthored a {{pamphlet}} entitled [...] "The Reason Why the Colored American {{is not in the}} World's Columbian Exposition - The Afro-American's Contribution to Columbian Literature" [...] addressing the issue. The exhibition included a number of <b>exhibits</b> put on <b>by</b> black individuals and approved by white organizers of the fair, including <b>exhibits</b> <b>by</b> the sculptor Edmonia Lewis, a painting <b>exhibit</b> <b>by</b> scientist George Washington Carver, and a statistical <b>exhibit</b> <b>by</b> John Imogen Howard.

5|$|Northern mockingbirds are altricial, meaning that, when hatched, {{they are}} born {{relatively}} immobile and defenseless and therefore require nourishment for a certain duration from their parents. The young have a survival bottleneck at the nestling stage because there are higher levels of nestling predation than egg predation. The levels of belligerence <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> parents therefore increase once eggs hatch {{but there is no}} increase during the egg stage.|$|E
5|$|Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball was one {{of eight}} works <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> Etty at the 1835 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, the others being The Bridge of Sighs, Phaedria and Cymochles on the Idle Lake, Study from a Young Lady: A York Beauty, Study of the Head of a Youth, Venus and her Satellites, The Warrior Arming and Wood Nymphs Sleeping: Satyr Bringing Flowers. Art {{historian}} Sarah Burnage believes Etty's choice of Venus and her Satellites may have been {{to draw attention to}} similarities with Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball and possibly to link the Williams-Wynn sisters' beauty with the legendary Venus.|$|E
5|$|Priapic worship {{amongst the}} women of Sicily {{continued}} into the 18th century; worshiping phallic votive objects and kissing such offerings before placing them upon the altar in the churches. Fetishism with the phallus architecturally and in smaller implements was also <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> certain Christian sects in medieval times, such as the Manichaeans, and was connected with masochism and sadism, a form of religious flagellantism. Smaller phallic shaped monuments {{in the form of}} idols, even vases, rings, drinking vessels and jewellery have been well-documented and could be found within medieval churches of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian sparrowhawk's pale underparts {{and darker}} upperparts are {{an example of}} countershading, which helps {{to break up the}} bird's outline. Countershading is <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> birds of prey which hunt birds and other {{fast-moving}} animals. The horizontal barring seen on adult Eurasian sparrowhawks is typical of woodland-dwelling predatory birds, while the adult male's bluish colour is also seen in other bird-eating raptors, including the peregrine falcon, the merlin and other Accipiters.|$|E
5|$|The gentry {{distinguished}} {{themselves in}} society through their intellectual and antiquarian pursuits, while {{the homes of}} prominent landholders attracted a variety of courtiers, including artisans, artists, educational tutors, and entertainers. Despite the disdain for trade, commerce and the merchant class <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> the highly cultured and elite exam-drafted scholar-officials, commercialism played {{a prominent role in}} Song culture and society. A scholar-official would be frowned upon by his peers if he pursued means of profiteering outside of his official salary; however, this did not stop many scholar-officials from managing business relations through the use of intermediary agents.|$|E
5|$|The most {{familiar}} condensed phases are solids and liquids while more exotic condensed phases include the superconducting phase <b>exhibited</b> <b>by</b> certain materials at low temperature, the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on crystal lattices of atoms, and the Bose–Einstein condensate found in ultracold atomic systems. The study of {{condensed matter physics}} involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using methods of theoretical physics to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior.|$|E
