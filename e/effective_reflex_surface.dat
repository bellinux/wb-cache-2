40|$|AbstractOrthostatic (postural) {{hypotension}} (OH) is {{a clinical}} feature commonly seen in {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) subjects with cervical and high thoracic lesions. It usually gets worse during head-up tilt postural change and is relieved by lying flat. The mechanisms of regulating the arterial blood pressure (BP) are complex. Normally, BP is maintained through a rapid and <b>effective</b> <b>reflex</b> adjustment of the autonomic nervous system, and with slower humoral compensatory changes to counteract the gravitational forces on blood. The leg muscle pumping mechanism also helps to facilitate venous return and improves BP. Failure of these mechanisms may lead to OH and orthostatic intolerance symptoms. The occurrence of OH may limit active participation in intense physical rehabilitation programmes by people with SCI, and facilitate the deterioration effects of immobilization and development of undesirable secondary medical complications. Advances in understanding the pathophysiology of OH are crucial for success in combating OH. Treatment usually includes both non-pharmacological and pharmacological measures. This article provides {{a review of the}} mechanisms of normal regulation of arterial BP, the pathophysiology of OH in SCI, and the common clinical management of OH...|$|R

The animals, a total of 75, were divided into three experimental groups, iobitridol, iohexol and cerebral artificial fluid (control group), with 25 animals per group. Then, these were divided into five subgroups of five animals each, and given doses of 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg kg- 1, while the control group received the equivalent volumes of contrast media tested. The animals were evaluated after 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min of intracisternal administration of these substances, for signs of depression and excitement, tactile palmar grasp, flexor, extensor, palpebral, papillary and pinna <b>reflexes,</b> <b>surface</b> righting and placing reactions, and with an auditory startle test.

Teaching practice was developed in Francisco Rodrigues Lobo High School in Leiria, with a 12 th grade class of pupils with good behavior and good school results, but with few aesthetic references and untrained critical thinking. This visual culture shortage was the starting point for the development of our work, once we thought that it was the main obstacle to work development with even more quality, not just technical, but also aesthetics. There is also a lack of motivation in most students, which could as well be surpassed through the visual culture development. The selected unit was the 'Illustration' and our main objective was to ascertain whether a teaching practice based on the presentation of several examples, organization of study visits, developing workshops, and others, had <b>effective</b> <b>reflexes</b> in improving results obtained in Drawing discipline. In parallel, we analyzed the existing conditions and the major difficulties encountered in the development of this type of teaching.

ResultsDespite this limitation, we find that larval zebrafish perform an <b>effective</b> vestibulo-ocular <b>reflex</b> (VOR) that serves to stabilize gaze in response to pitch and roll tilts. By using single-cell electroporations and targeted laser ablations, we identified a specific class of central vestibular neurons, located in the tangential nucleus, that are essential for the utricle-dependent VOR.

40|$|The {{air-breathing}} mangrove crab Goniopsis cruentata ventilates the branchial chambers {{with its}} scaphognathites (SG). Ventilation is predominantly {{in the forward}} direction, but is punctuated by bouts of reversed pumping. Reversals are more frequent when crabs are in air than in water, and yet more frequent during respiratory stress (hypoxia or exercise). Reversed SG pumping is tightly coupled with bursts of impulses to the dorsal-ventral muscles (DVM) which span the anterolateral thorax. Phasic contractions of the DVMs increase the hemolymph pressure in the dorsal sinuses. These pressure pulses help drive hemolymph through the lungs. The coupled SG reversed ventilation and DVM-assisted increases in lung perfusion {{appear to be an}} adaptation to increase gas exchange at the lungs.

40|$|The {{manner in}} which {{activation}} levels influence intrinsic muscular properties and contributions of the stretch reflex were studied in homogeneous soleus (SOL) and heterogeneous gastrocnemius (G) muscles in the decerebrate cat. Intrinsic mechanical properties were represented by the initial stiffness of the muscle, measured prior to reflex action, and by the tendency of the muscle to yield during stretch {{in the absence of}} the stretch reflex. Stiffness regulation by the stretch reflex was evaluated by measuring the extent to which reflex action reduces yielding and the extent to which stiffness depends on background force. Intrinsic mechanical properties were measured in muscles deprived of <b>effective</b> autogenic <b>reflexes</b> using the method of muscular reinnervation. Reinnervated muscles were recruited to force levels comparable to those achieved during natural locomotion. As force declined during crossed-extension reflexes in reinnervated and intact muscles, initial stiffness declined according to similar convex trajectories. The data did not support the hypothesis that, for a given force level, initial stiffness is greatest in populations of predominantly type I motor units. Incremental stiffness (Δf/Δl) of both G and SOL increased in the presence of the stretch reflex. Yielding of SOL (ratio of incremental to initial stiffness) substantially decreased in the presence of the stretch reflex over the full range of forces. In reflexive G, yielding significantly decreased for low to intermediate forces, whereas at higher forces, yielding was similar irrespective of the presence or absence of the stretch reflex.

Reflex and action jerks often consisted {{of a series of}} EMG bursts, some of which were polyphasic. The interval between repetitive EMG bursts was most commonly approximately 20 ms. The first EMG burst following median nerve stimulation varied in latency by a few milliseconds. Needle recordings of this reflex response showed more than one peak in half of the post-stimulus time histograms (PSTH) collected. Multiple peaks were narrow and separated by as little as 4 ms. Single trials of the EEG activity over the sensorimotor cortex were recorded during stimulation or voluntary movement of the contralateral limb in five patients. Activity typically consisted of a rhythmic series of giant positive spike-slow negative wave complexes. Intervals between spikes tended to cluster at approximately 20 ms. Frequency histograms of spike to EMG burst intervals confirmed that spikes preceded muscle discharges but they showed more than one peak. These peaks were narrow and separated by as little as 3 ms.

For example, instead of cre-ating separate grammar symbols to mark the definiteness of an NP, our parser might instead capture the same information from the first word of the NP.

Conventional methods for detecting dysfunction (radiologic and manometric examinations) often fail to detect abnormality in these patients. Radionuclide transit (RT), a new method for detecting esophageal motor dysfunction, was used to prospectively assess function in 29 patients with symptomatic GER uncomplicated by stricture before and three months after antireflux surgery (HILL). The preoperative incidence of dysphagia and esophageal dysfunction was 73 % and 52 %, respectively. During operation (Hill repair), intraoperative measurement of the lower esophageal sphincter pressure was performed and the LESP raised to levels between 45 and 55 mmHg. The preoperative lower esophageal sphincter pressure was raised from a mean of 8. 6 mmHg, to mean of 18. 5 mmHg after operation. No patient has free reflux after operation. Postoperative studies on 20 patients demonstrated persistence of all preoperative esophageal dysfunction despite loss of dysphagia.

40|$|Stroke causes paresis in leg muscles, such as {{the knee}} extensors, that {{significantly}} impairs motor control and function during tasks such as walking. Reduced endurance and increased kinematic asymmetries during walking over time indicate paretic musculature may fatigue more quickly than non-paretic musculature. The primary {{purpose of this study}} was to identify abnormalities in neuromuscular fatigue (reduction in force over time) of the paretic knee extensors and associate them with motor performance. We investigated the effects of repeated six second isometric submaximal (30 % of maximum voluntary contraction) knee extensor fatiguing contractions on task failure and motor performance in ten chronic stroke subjects and compared them to ten, healthy controls. A systematic criterion determined task failure. We recorded knee extensor torque, stretch <b>reflex</b> responses, <b>surface</b> electromyography (EMG) of agonist (rectus femoris and vastus medialis) and antagonist (medial hamstring) knee extensor muscles, and muscle fiber conduction velocity (CV) of the vastus lateralis muscle as interpretive measures of neuromuscular fatigue. A power spectral density analysis of the intermittent target torque estimated the effect of fatigue on force fluctuations. Two isometric submaximal torque tracking tasks performed before and after fatigue provided direct measures of fatigue on force variability and error. Stroke subjects failed the fatiguing task significantly sooner than control subjects. In controls, averaged rectified EMG amplitude significantly increased and CV significantly reduced with fatigue, while no changes occurred in stroke. Fatigue caused a spectral shift toward higher force fluctuation frequencies in control but not stroke subjects. Time to task failure in stroke subjects negatively correlated with their walking speed. Additionally, pre-fatigue torque variability and error was greater in stroke than control subjects, and increased significantly with fatigue. In summary, paretic knee extensors have increased neuromuscular fatigability of the paretic knee extensors which relates to walking speed. The interpretative measures suggest that central factors may contribute more to time-to-task failure as compared to peripheral (muscular factors) in stroke survivors. Performance data demonstrate pre and post-fatigue impairments in sub-maximal force regulation.

Phenomena like adverb placement, short verb movement and verb second, which form core cases in support of contemporary notions of CP-fields and IP-fields in the clause, are better handled in other ways which do not resort {{to the notion of}} arbitrary selectional sequences of (functional) syntactic heads. Constraints on the relative ordering with which sentential adverbs can co-occur are treated as a polarity phenomenon. Speaker-oriented adverbs are excluded from monotone decreasing environments, and hence, cannot be outscoped by adverbs like never. Apart from such requirements, adverb placement is argued to be free. The standard analysis of verb-second in terms of the selectional sequence C,I,V and headmovement of the finite verb to C with subsequent topicalization is shown to run into a series of problems which are taken to show that verb-second does not involve head movement, and that it should not be characterized in terms of a selectional sequence of heads. The proposed accound treats topicalization, verb movement and argument shift as <b>surface</b> <b>reflexes</b> of one movement operation to the first position. This is argued to explain a number of puzzling phenomena, including Holmberg s Generalization concerning the constraints on Object Shift in Scandinavian. Finally, (short) verb movement phenomena, as witnessed in italian, are analuzed as a scrambling phenomenon, driven by stress/focus and scope considerations. This explains the optionality of such verb movements and resolves a some paradoxical properties of the standard treatment by removing the need to postulate specific functional heads to attract the verbs...|$|R
40|$|When a voluntarily {{contracting}} human {{muscle is}} stretched its <b>surface</b> <b>reflex</b> electromyographic response has both short-latency (M 1) and long-latency (M 2) components. The M 1 component occurs at a latency compatible with monosynaptic reflex activation. The long-latency component results from stimulation {{of skin and}} other subcutaneous receptors. In the initial experiment, using the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) of the hand, the reflex sensitivity in normal human subjects was studied by comparing the various components of the electromyographic response generated by briefly stretching the voluntarily contracting muscle in subjects of various ages. It was found that age-related changes occur in the reflex response of human subjects. Although it is already known that the reflex response in human muscle slows with age, {{the result of the}} experiment showed that the size of that reflex response becomes smaller. The evidence suggests an impaired reflex sensitivity in older people which could be reflected in other motor control systems within the body. A detailed investigation was then undertaken to discover the causes of this change. Although the reflex response (M 1) was found to alter with age the M 2 component did not. This would seem to rule out neuromuscular block (NMB). NMB as a cause of the change was investigated and was found not to occur in the paradigm employed in this investigation. Possible changes in the mechanical properties of muscles and joints were looked for in a series of experiments using an accelerometer. No changes large enough to account for the reflex impairment could be found. In a further series of experiments the effects of fatigue and the effects of training on the electrical response of the FDI were studied. In a final series of experiments the changes with age, in the effects of coffee upon blood pressure were investigated. <p...|$|R
40|$|Perioral {{electrical}} stimuli cause inhibitory reflex {{responses in}} single motor-units (SMU) and surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings from voluntary contracted human jaw-closing muscles. Tonic experimental masseter pain {{has recently been}} shown to reduce the inhibitory <b>reflex</b> response in <b>surface</b> EMG recordings but the effect on SMU activity has not been described. In this study, motor-unit action potentials were recorded with wire electrodes inserted into the left masseter in eleven subjects. The subjects kept the SMU firing rate around 10 Hz by feedback. Ninety-nine electrical stimuli were applied sequentially to the left mental nerve with increasing stimulus delays in steps of 1 ms after the preceding motor unit action potential. The inhibitory reflex in SMU was recorded before, during and after infusion of hypertonic saline (5 %) into the ipsilateral masseter muscle. Spike train data were used to calculate (1) the mean pre- and post-stimulus inter-spike-intervals (ISI) {{in all of the}} 99 trials, (2) cumulative changes in firing probability, and (3) estimation of the compound inhibitory post- synaptic potential (IPSP) in the masseter motoneuron. Tonic masseter pain did not change pre-stimulus SMU firing characteristics but the mean ISI for the first post-stimulus discharge (158. 2 ± 9. 2 ms) was significantly decreased compared to the pre-pain (175. 8 ± 11. 3 ms, P ≤ 0. 05) and post-pain conditions (172. 6 ± 11. 6 ms, P ≤ 0. 05). The post-stimulus firing probability was significantly increased and the relative amplitude of the estimated IPSP significantly decreased during tonic masseter pain compared to pre-pain and post-pain conditions. In conclusion, this study indicates that tonic masseter pain has a net excitatory effect on the inhibitory jaw- reflexes, which could be mediated by presynaptic mechanisms on the involved motoneurons. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Presynaptic {{inhibition}} of transmission between Ia afferent terminals and alpha motoneurons (Ia PSI) {{is a major}} control mechanism associated with soleus H-reflex modulation during human locomotion. Rhythmic arm cycling suppresses soleus H-reflex amplitude by increasing segmental Ia PSI. There is a reciprocal organization in the human nervous system such that arm cycling modulates H-reflexes in leg muscles and leg cycling modulates H-reflexes in forearm muscles. However, comparatively {{little is known about}} mechanisms subserving the effects from leg to arm. Using a conditioning-test (C-T) stimulation paradigm, {{the purpose of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that changes in Ia PSI underlie the modulation of H-reflexes in forearm flexor muscles during leg cycling. Subjects performed leg cycling and static activation while H-reflexes were evoked in forearm flexor muscles. H-reflexes were conditioned with either electrical stimuli to the radial nerve (to increase Ia PSI; C-T interval  =  20 ms) or to the superficial radial (SR) nerve (to reduce Ia PSI; C-T interval  =  37 - 47 ms). While stationary, H-reflex amplitudes were significantly suppressed by radial nerve conditioning and facilitated by SR nerve conditioning. Leg cycling suppressed H-reflex amplitudes and the amount of this suppression was increased with radial nerve conditioning. SR conditioning stimulation removed the suppression of H-reflex amplitude resulting from leg cycling. Interestingly, these effects and interactions on H-reflex amplitudes were observed with subthreshold conditioning stimulus intensities (radial n., ∼ 0. 6 ×MT; SR n., ∼ perceptual threshold) that did not have clear post synaptic effects. That is, did not evoke <b>reflexes</b> in the <b>surface</b> EMG of forearm flexor muscles. We conclude that the interaction between leg cycling and somatosensory conditioning of forearm H-reﬂex amplitudes is mediated by modulation of Ia PSI pathways. Overall our results support a conservation of neural control mechanisms between the arms and legs during locomotor behaviors in humans...|$|R

Sports Exerc., Vol. 43, No. 1, pp. 108 - 114, 2011. Decreased core {{stability}} {{has been}} suggested {{to be associated with}} a higher occurrence of lower extremity injuries and low back pain. In a physical contact sport like soccer, direction-specific muscle reflex responses are crucial in maintaining core stability. Delayed core muscle response times repeatedly have been reported in patients with low back pain, but no study has compared core muscle reflex latencies and postural control between soccer players and less active nonplayers. Purpose: The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate whether soccer players will exhibit shorter average core muscle reflex latencies along with less postural sway in response to a sudden trunk perturbation compared with nonplayers. A second goal was to see whether postural control measures are a valid, more practical alternative for the use of surface EMG in measuring reflexive core neuromuscular control. Methods: Sudden trunk loading in the frontal and sagittal plane was used in 10 high-level amateur soccer players and 11 less active nonplayers to study core muscle <b>reflex</b> latencies, using <b>surface</b> EMG of six major trunk muscles. Simultaneously, kinematic response data of a balance seat were obtained using gyroscopes measuring seat angular velocity. Results: Soccer players demonstrated shorter reflex latencies compared with nonplayers for the rectus abdominis, erector spinae, and externus obliquus muscles in response to sagittal plane perturbations. These shorter reflex latencies went along with greater seat movement in response to sudden trunk loading, with moderate correlations between the two measures. Conclusions: The results showing shorter reflex latencies and greater balancing movements for soccer players add to the debate whether more postural sway is an appropriate indicator of having less neuromuscular control...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{depressive}} disorder is associated with impaired baroreceptor or baroreflex sensitivity, which is proposed to be a predisposing factor for sudden death in patients with manifest cardiac disease. These studies have not evaluated the afferent and efferent components of the cardiac baroreflex loop or other baroreflex mechanisms that regulate target processes (cardiac metabolism and blood pressure variability) related to the impairment. The objective {{of this study was to}} gain more insight into autonomic functioning in depressive disorder to more fully examine the potential basis for increased cardiac mortality. METHODS: The subjects were 28 women and men with unipolar major depression who were taking antidepressant medications and who were in partial remission and free of cardiovascular or other serious disease, and 28 healthy control subjects matched for sex, age, and ethnicity. The two samples were compared for negative affective dispositions (anger expression, hostility, defensiveness, anxiety), spontaneous (closed-loop) baroreflex activity, heart rate, heart rate variability, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate-systolic blood pressure double product under resting conditions. RESULTS: Depressed patients showed a general disposition to anger suppression coupled with higher hostility and anxiety, and lower defensiveness. The patients showed higher general sympathetic activity (high levels of blood pressure, low-frequency heart rate variability) and lower parasympathetic-related activity (high heart rate and reduced high frequency heart rate variability) with affected cardiac metabolism estimated by the double product. Depressed patients had lower baroreflex sensitivity related to a higher gain of the afferent component of the baroreflex without respective gain adjustment of its efferent component (reflex gain 'de-afferentation'). It was coupled with a compensatory higher number of <b>effective</b> baroreflex reactions (<b>reflex</b> gating 're-afferentation'). Antidepressant agents and depressed mood had additional independent effects on baroreflex sensitivity through the efferent component of the cardiac baroreflex loop. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that different baroreflex components and mechanisms may be impaired in patients with depression and may contribute to their increased cardiac risk...|$|R
