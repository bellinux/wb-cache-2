Cambridge's ass. Even if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home and bring the whole US squad with me."

500|$|I {{really started}} second-guessing myself. And then I realized, like, all right, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with my gut.

Then they're like, 'We {{want to hear a}} hip-hop record.' 'Why is she dressing like this? She should show less skin.' 'She should show more.' You know what I mean?

500|$|In January 2003, riots {{broke out}} in Phnom Penh after a Cambodian {{newspaper}} incorrectly reported that a Thai actress had stated Angkor Wat properly belonged to Thailand. On 29 January, the Thai embassy was burned, and hundreds of Thai immigrants fled the country to avoid the violence. During the riots, a caller to Beehive Radio claimed incorrectly that Cambodian embassy officials were killed in Bangkok. On 31 January, Sonando was arrested and accused of [...] "relaying false information", [...] "inciting discrimination", and [...] "inciting crime". He stated to reporters, [...] "They blame me for broadcasting an opinion of a listener {{which turned out to}} be untrue.

500|$|As {{part of its}} {{marketing}} campaign for The Girl, HBO released a 30-second trailer in August 2012. During a Television Critics Association press tour promoting the film, Hedren said [...] "I {{have to say that}} when I first heard Toby's [...] voice as Alfred Hitchcock, my body just froze". Hedren's daughter, Melanie Griffith, attended a screening; when the film ended, the audience was silent until Griffith said [...] "Well, now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back into therapy again!"

500|$|Throughout his life, Rudolph {{suffered}} from a gambling problem and was labeled a [...] "compulsive gambler". [...] He would often spend his leisure time placing bets at race tracks and Las Vegas, Nevada and Puerto Rico casinos. At that time, NBA referees were allowed to gamble, but this practice has since been prohibited. [...] As he incurred gambling losses, Rudolph was once offered by a Las Vegas gambler to erase his outstanding debt by participating in point shaving. [...] However, he {{refused to accept the}} offer and said to his wife, [...] "It goes against all my principles. I love the game too much, respect it too much. I couldn't do it to you. I couldn't do it to the memory of my father, and I couldn't do it to myself. If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into bankruptcy, something I'd hate to do, I'd do it," [...] according to in a 1992 New York Times interview with Susan Rudolph. [...] Rudolph had cashed in his $60,000 pension fund to pay debts and he still owed an additional $100,000. [...] While he refused to seek professional help, Rudolph cut back on his gambling habit later in his life.|$|E
500|$|At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Peirsol won two gold medals. [...] In {{his first}} event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol {{surprised}} many after {{he failed to}} make the final, which he attributed to a miscalculation of his own position in the semi-finals. [...] Peirsol said, [...] "I thought I was going faster. [...] I am very disappointed. I completely misjudged my race. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on, pick myself up and focus on my next events." [...] But Peirsol's world record in the 100-meter backstroke would stay in place after the final. In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won the gold in a time of 1:51.92, breaking his own world record of 1:53.08 by more than a second. Peirsol then competed in the 50-meter backstroke but did not advance past the heats. In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Eric Shanteau, Michael Phelps, and David Walters to win gold in a world record time of 3:27.28, lowering the old mark of 3:29.34 set a year ago in Beijing. While leading off the relay, Peirsol broke the championship record in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 52.19, bettering the previous mark of 52.26 set by Junya Koga.|$|E

500|$|The {{session was}} stopped while doctors {{attended}} to Ratzenberger. After initially being taken by ambulance to the on-circuit medical centre, he was airlifted to Maggiore Hospital shortly after, the second driver {{to be admitted}} there during the weekend. The session was restarted approximately 25minutes later, but several teams—including Williams and Benetton—took no further part. Later in hospital, {{it was announced that}} Ratzenberger had {{died as a result of}} his multiple injuries. His death marked the first Formula One race weekend fatality since the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix when Riccardo Paletti was killed. It had been eight years since Elio de Angelis died testing a Brabham car at the Circuit Paul Ricard. Professor Sid Watkins, then head of the Formula One on-track medical team, recalled in his memoirs Ayrton Senna's reaction to the news, stating that [...] "Ayrton broke down and cried on my shoulder." [...] Watkins tried to persuade Senna not to race the following day, asking [...] "What else do you need to do? You have been world champion three times, you are obviously the quickest driver. Give it up and let's go fishing." [...] Senna replied, [...] "Sid, there are certain things over which we have no control. I cannot quit, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on." ...|$|E
500|$|A.G. Gaston, who {{was appalled}} {{at the idea of}} using children, {{was on the phone with}} white {{attorney}} David Vann trying to negotiate a resolution to the crisis. [...] When Gaston looked out the window and saw the children being hit with high-pressure water, he said, [...] "Lawyer Vann, I can't talk to you now or ever. My people are out there fighting for their lives and my freedom. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> help them", and hung up the phone. Black parents and adults who were observing cheered the marching students, but when the hoses were turned on, bystanders began to throw rocks and bottles at the police. [...] To disperse them, Connor ordered police to use German shepherd dogs to keep them in line. James Bevel wove in and out of the crowds warning them, [...] "If any cops get hurt, we're going to lose this fight." [...] At 3p.m., the protest was over. [...] During a kind of truce, protesters went home. Police removed the barricades and re-opened the streets to traffic. That evening King told worried parents in a crowd of a thousand, [...] "Don't worry about your children who are in jail. The eyes of the world are on Birmingham. We're going on in spite of dogs and fire hoses. We've gone too far to turn back." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through the windshield, and she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in, lay in the same position, so they can get a close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{completing}} The Way I See It, Saadiq previewed its {{songs in}} May 2008 to music industry associates and journalists at the Sony Club in New York City. He also planned a grassroots marketing {{strategy for the}} record, which evolved from his difficulty with Columbia executives to promote the album and their idea of issuing its songs as vinyl records. He felt that [...] "nobody at the label knew" [...] him {{in an interview with}} The Dallas Morning News: [...] "They had this record that I turned in that sounded like a '60s record. 'What the hell do we do with this record?' It was quality. There was not a lot of marketing and promotion, but they knew I had the credibility so you don't just throw it in the garbage ... I don't mind being a [...] because that's actually a better road to take. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in one more time and prove myself again because I am starting over again." [...] In the week leading up to its release, Saadiq made promotional appearances at V-103's For Sisters Only, the International Soul Music Summit, and the Uptown Restaurant & Lounge in Atlanta. He also performed songs from the album on VH1 Soulstage. Columbia released the album both on CD and as a collector's edition box set with 7-inch vinyl singles. In the United Kingdom, it was issued with two bonus tracks—a [...] "Euro version" [...] of [...] "Big Easy" [...] and the song [...] "Come On Home".|$|E
500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E
