The council {{has the authority to}} suspend or <b>dismantle</b> the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> {{the board of directors of}} the regional water and wastewater services providers. The members of the council include the main Palestinian ministries. The Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) acts as regulatory authority, responsible for the legislation, monitoring and human resources development in the sector. The PWA is also in charge of water resources management. It has the mandate to carry out regular inspections and to keep a register of all water related data and information. The authority shares responsibility for irrigation with the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and for environmental protection with the Environment Quality Authority (EQA).|$|R

He began an extensive citywide street improvement program financed though a bond issue, and located funding sufficient to construct numerous street overpasses and underpasses, eliminating most at-grade railway crossings within the city limits. Morrison acquiesced in New Orleans Public <b>Service's</b> <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> the city's extensive streetcar network in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|HMAS AE1 (originally {{known as}} just AE1) was an E-class {{submarine}} of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

5000|$|In November 1910, {{the monitor}} Puritan was wrecked by an {{explosion}} of four hundred pounds of gelatin during ordnance tests being conducted under Knight's direction. The board of inquiry reported that the monitor {{had been allowed to}} sink into the mud despite having remained afloat for twenty-two hours, subsequently requiring the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> a <b>wrecking</b> company to raise. Congress blamed Knight for this perceived lapse and ordered that he be prosecuted for [...] "culpable negligence and inefficiency in the performance of duty". A court-martial of seven rear admirals convened at the Norfolk Navy Yard, and honorably acquitted Knight. Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer disapproved the finding and referred the case back to the court for reconsideration, but the court reaffirmed Knight's acquittal and he was restored to active duty.|$|R

500|$|For instrumentation, Wilson {{employed}} the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> [...] "the <b>Wrecking</b> Crew", the nickname for a conglomerate of session musicians active in Los Angeles at that time. Production for [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] spanned {{more than a}} dozen recording sessions at four different Hollywood studios, {{at a time when most}} pop singles were typically recorded in a day or two. It was reported to have used over 90 hours of magnetic recording tape, with an eventual budget estimated between $50,000 and $75,000 (equivalent to $ and $ in [...] ), at that time the largest sum spent on a single. In comparison, the whole of Pet Sounds had cost $70,000 ($), itself an unusually high cost for an album. According to Wilson, the Electro-Theremin work alone cost $15,000 ($). It is said that Wilson was so puzzled by [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] that he would often arrive at a session, consider a few possibilities, and then leave without recording anything, which exacerbated costs.|$|R
