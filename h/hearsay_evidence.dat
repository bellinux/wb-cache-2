The prosecution had relied upon three pieces of evidence to prove Brown's culpability. These were the testimony of Mark Burcombe, who had witnessed McIlwaine's killing and had been present at Robb's killing; the forensic material found by the RUC at the crime scene (including DNA samples found on McIlwaine's jacket which matched Brown's); the <b>hearsay</b> <b>evidence</b> of Brown's former girlfriend who claimed he had admitted to her that he had killed McIlwaine. Burcombe declared that McIlwaine was murdered because he had witnessed Robb's killing.|$|E
500|$|The Grand Jury Clause does very little, if anything, to {{regulate}} the procedures of the grand jury. For example, the Clause does not prohibit a grand jury indictment based solely on <b>hearsay</b> <b>evidence.</b> Non-fundamental flaws with the grand jury, such {{as a violation of}} the defendant's self-incrimination rights or a violation of grand jury secrecy do not trigger a right not to be tried. In United States v. Williams (1992), where the Court rejected a rule that would have required [...] "substantial exculpatory evidence" [...] to be presented to the grand jury, the defendant did not even argue a Fifth Amendment violation. The lack of a grand jury does not deprive the court of jurisdiction, and the defendant may waive the grand jury right.|$|E

While the provisions serve similar purposes, they do not always produce the same result. Two sorts of cases are discussed: cases where the <b>hearsay</b> rule admits <b>evidence</b> that should be excluded because it violates the defendant's right to examine or have examined the witnesses against him, and cases where the <b>hearsay</b> rule excludes <b>evidence</b> that should be admitted to protect the defendant's right to a fair trial. The treatment of these cases is contrasted to the treatment of similar cases under the Sixth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution. © 2012 De Gruyter. All rights reserved...|$|R

Citing a lack of evidence without Jordan's testimony, the state closed its investigation on September 22, 1994. According to the grand juries, the evidence presented by the Santa Barbara police and the LAPD was not convincing enough to indict Jackson or subpoena him, even though grand juries can indict the accused purely on <b>hearsay</b> <b>evidence.</b> According to a 1994 report by Variety, a source in contact with the grand juries stated, [...] "none of the witnesses so far have offered anything that would directly implicate the singer."

The applicant could rely on <b>hearsay</b> <b>evidence.</b> However, the Court of Appeal has stated that it does not expect a court to find that the criminal standard has been reached by relying solely on <b>hearsay</b> <b>evidence.</b> The Civil Evidence Act 1995 itself makes clear that courts should consider what weight, if any at all, attaches to hearsay material. In Cleary, the Court of Appeal again restated that courts should consider attaching no weight at all to such material, in accordance with the words of the statute.|$|E

Yet <b>hearsay</b> <b>evidences</b> point out that this temple is about 2000 years old.According to a legend this temple was consecrated by a sage named Swetharshi. The legend says Agasthya Muni on his way to River for offering his customary ablution was confronted by two demons named Neela and Swetha. Agasthya Muni cursed them. On their request for penance, Agasthya Muni advised them to perform Tapas at two Shiva Temples. The place where Neela performed Tapas {{came to be known as}} Neeleswaram. Swetha performed his Tapas at Thiruvangad (Tiru-van-kad, meaning the sacred dense forest). They were later known as Neelarshi and Swetharshi. It is said that Swetharshi consecrated a Shiva temple & Vishnu temple at the place where he performed his Tapas. It is believed that the Shiva installed by Swetharshi was very fierce, hence to calm its fury another Shiva temple was consecrated just opposite. Now the temple complex consists of two Shiva temples facing each other on the north side and the Big Sri Rama temple on the South. There is also a slightly different version of the legend, Which says that Shiva Temple was consecrated by Neelarshi - a Shiva Bhakta and Sree Rama temple was consecrated by Swetharshi - a Vishnu Bhakta.|$|R
