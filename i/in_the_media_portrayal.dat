Även om spår av dessa konflikter och oegentligheter har funnits där sedan idrottens ursprung argumenterar sport managementforskning av nyare datum för en ökad förekomst, hand i hand med ökat politiskt, medialt, sponsor och ekonomiskt intrång. Trots dessa negativa uttrycks relativt höga angelägenhet för idrottens styrning har det vetenskapliga intresset varit begränsat. I ett försök att reducera detta glapp i litteraturen försöker detta kapitel summera existerande kunskap om fenomenet samtidigt som det försöker förutse möjlig utveckling inom idrottslig styrning. Conflicts of interest, financial irregularities, {{misuse of}} power, lack of transparency, manipulation of trust, ideological struggles, social exclusion; these are different {{examples of the}} dark sides challenging contemporary sport governance. Although the emergence of various dark sides has been inherent to sports associations since their origins, recent literature on sport management has argued that their frequency has increased, {{hand in hand with}} the growing encroachment of sport with politics, mass media, sponsorship and business. Notwithstanding the relatively high importance of the dark sides in contemporary sport governance, academic attention on this phenomenon has rather limited. To reduce this gap in the literature, this chapter summarizes existing scholarship about the phenomenon and considers potential future developments within SGBs in relation to their dark sides. We define as the dark sides of sport governance those behaviours that are detrimental for sport, sport associations and their civil and democratic nature, or those behaviours violating legal or organizational norms, or those that are deliberately harmful for sporting people, specific social groups or even for the whole society. Frequently, the dark sides of sport governance are expressed through power games, allegiances or various forms of corruption. On the other hand, the dark sides of sport governance shall not be confused with any form of struggle and conflict, which can be an inherent part of sport governance and democratic discussion among members and governance boards. Throughout this chapter we emphasize also that an emergence of the dark sides in sport governance cannot be grasped solely in terms of mere personal and isolated scandals as it is frequently represented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>portrayal</b> of single scandals and affairs related to sport management. Additionally, the dark sides of sport governance must be viewed as a product of structural and systematic developments of contemporary sport, governance and overall society. In other words, the dark sides of sport governance must not be perceived exclusively as particular conflicts, struggles or plots organized by single persons or small groups, but rather as the results of more general social processes and developments, the increasing interconnection of sport business, media and sponsorship and encroachment with politics. This happens not only at a global level of sport governance and management related to professional and elite sport, but also at national levels of sport governance and management of amateur sport...|$|E
40|$|Summary This study {{examines}} {{the interplay between}} media portrayal and identity construction for Moroccan minorities in Belgium and the Netherlands. Immigration and integration, as well as religious and ethnic minorities are often depicted negatively in the news. Especially the events related to the young people from various countries departing as foreign fighters to Syria (so-called 'Syria fighters’) and terrorist attacks in France and Belgium have {{caused a lot of}} negative news about Muslims and Moroccan minorities. This type of media portrayal can influence feelings of belonging in the Netherlands and Belgium, and can thus affect feelings of national commitment and identification. The case of the 'Syria fighters' is used as an illustrative example of the media portrayal of Moroccan minorities in the current social context. We chose a mixed method approach to study the integration debate, news Moroccan minority, news reception and impact of integration related news and social networks on social identifications, feelings of belonging, and online and offline social interactions. Several types of data have been used: newspapers, forums, interviews and a cross-national survey. Additionally, various types of analysis have been used: relational discourse analysis, inductive and deductive media framing, online ethnography, social network analysis, and qualitative content analysis. The results indicate that the public debate on minority integration debate is more intensely debated in the Netherlands than in Flanders (2006 - 2012) and that anti-immigration views have become more common in the public debate in the Low Countries. The Syria fighter case study confirms findings from previous research that framing with respect to Muslims is relatively one-sided and negative. Various frames were used in the news articles, but the positive frames were mostly invalidated by hints of the journalists such as quote marks or co-occurrence with negative frames. In mainstream forums in Belgium and the Netherlands there was less space for nuance: the negative frames were dominant. Only the Moroccan forum showed more variance, with the greatest diversity of frames on the Syria fighters. The online forum discussions reflected perceived tensions between communities (Muslims and/or Moroccan minority versus majority groups in Belgium and the Netherlands), including through the regular occurrence of slurs that referred to religion or origin. Media portrayal, social networks and identity construction have been discussed with Moroccan Belgians and Moroccan Dutch in a series of semi-structured in-depth interviews. The results show that the participants do not recognize themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>portrayal</b> in Belgium and the Netherlands, which is perceived as one-sided and overly negative for both their ethnic and religious background. The media portrayal also had an impact on their interpersonal relationships with people of the majority groups, who incorporate elements and interpretations of the media coverage about Moroccan minorities and Muslims in their worldviews. Most participants identified with a mix of their national, ethnic and religious background. A small group of participants repeatedly experienced that people from the majority group do not affirm their expression of national identity and treat them invariably and exclusively as Moroccans and/or Muslims. In reaction, these participants solely value their ethnic or religious identities. This is reflected in their social network, which consists of mostly people with a Moroccan and/or Muslim background. The results of these interview studies are examined on a larger scale in a survey, analyzing the relationship between perceived discrimination, media use and identity construction. These results indicate that Moroccan minorities perceived high levels of discrimination and that the perceived discrimination is positively related to their ethnic and religious identifications. The more discrimination they perceive, the more value they attach to their ethnic and religious identifications. The perceived discrimination was independent of the national identification of the participants. It was also clear that there is no link between the ethnic and religious identifications {{on the one hand and}} national identification on the other. Identification as a Muslim and as a Moroccan does not impede identification as Belgian or Dutch. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 PURPOSE: Teen dating {{violence}} (TDV) {{continues to}} be a significant social justice issue. The prevention of TDV requires an attention to risk and protective factors across ecological system levels. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> is one of the primary cultural drivers of societal-level social scripts about the causes, consequences, and lived experiences of TDV. Framing theory asserts that <b>the</b> <b>media’s</b> <b>portrayal</b> of social issues, including what contextual information is included and/or excluded, impacts individual-level attitudes about TDV and potential policy responses. Through an interrogation of the discursive properties of young adult (YA) novels, this study investigates the representation of TDV in YA literature, a media genre that is marketed to adolescent audiences. METHODS: Data include all young adult novels (n= 8) published between 2004 - 2013 that have a primary focus on TDV. Texts were analyzed systematically using Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) methods. RESULTS: Victimology, pop-psychology, and postfeminist discourses were used to describe victims’ entry and experience of TDV victimization, the antecedents of TDV, and perpetrators’ use of abusive behaviors. Victimology discourses shape our social understanding of the victims’ characteristics of victims that predispose individuals to becoming crime victims. Victims were framed as inherently vulnerable due to their inexperience in relationships, enduring a significant family tragedy, and having low self-esteem. Pop-psychology discourses, which are commonsense understandings of mental health issues that have been derived from more nuanced psychological theories, were enacted through portraying the perpetration of TDV as originating from perpetrators’ family and mental issues. Postfeminist discourses, which are inclusive of neoliberal ideologies, employ a rhetoric of personal responsibility, choice, and individualism and render second-wave feminism anachronistic. Postfeminist discourses represented TDV as an individual-level issue, where victims are agentic participants in abusive relationships. External social systems were underrepresented, and victims were positioned as responsible for independently ending their relationships. Rather than framing TDV as a violation of a victim’s human rights, or as a systemic issue related to gender norms, it was depicted as negatively impacting victims’ future trajectories, ability to maintain their physical appearance, and individual self-concept. DISCUSSION & IMPLICATIONS: The structural determinants of TDV have been overshadowed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>media’s</b> <b>portrayal</b> of TDV, <b>in</b> favor of narrow portrayals of victimization that focus on victims and individual-level family histories and personal characteristics. Rather than underscoring how societal-level factors contribute to TDV, perpetration was seen as stemming from family dysfunction and mental health issues. The language of gender inequality has been supplanted by a postfeminist rhetoric of choice, personal responsibility, and vulnerability. These findings underscore how victimology, pop-psychology and postfeminist discourses have permeated the public vernacular about the causes and consequence of TDV. Implications for TDV prevention programs including <b>the</b> importance of <b>media</b> literacy will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 In fall of 2014, the College Board {{released}} a new Advanced Placement United States History (APUSH) framework written {{over seven years}} {{by a panel of}} professional historians. By shifting the focus of the framework from content mastery to critical inquiry, the authors hoped to bring <b>the</b> course more <b>in</b> line with college level expectations. Prominent Conservatives, however, condemned the 2014 framework and accused the College Board of seeking to indoctrinate students with leftist identity politics. Conservative pushback caused the College Board to reevaluate the 2014 framework, resulting in an updated 2015 edition. This caused an angry outpouring from <b>media</b> on <b>the</b> Left accusing the College Board of caving to Conservative pressure and white washing the United State’s checkered past.

40|$|Depression is {{a common}} mental health problem in primary health care. One third of the Swedish {{population}} is expected to experience depression at some point <b>in</b> their lives. <b>The</b> understanding of depression has expanded, both from a lay and primary health care perspective. The number of persons considering themselves as depressed, receiving the diagnosis, and getting treatment for it has increased steadily over the last decades. Unchanged, however, is that depression is diagnosed twice as often in women as in men, while twice as many men as women commit suicide. These gender differences appear in adolescence. In earlier research biomedical, psychological, and social-cultural explanations of gender differences have been discussed. Patient’s own perspectives have more seldom stood in focus, and men’s narratives in particular are still scarce. In this thesis, gender, i. e. {{how to be a}} woman or a man, is considered as a construct, formed and negotiated <b>in</b> social interaction. <b>The</b> aim of the study is to explore the gendered face of depression from a patient perspective: How is depression expressed and explained by patients in primary health care, by women and men, adults and adolescents? How are depressed women and men portrayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>media?</b> How do patient and media accounts of depression compare with <b>the</b> perspective offered <b>in</b> medical research articles? Method and material The analyses are based on data from three different sources: patient narratives, newspaper portrayals and scientific medical articles. – 37 in-depth interviews were undertaken with primary health care patients diagnosed with depression. Informants were chosen to include both men and women, grown-ups (Studies I + II) and young adults (Study V) of varying occupational and social class backgrounds. Data were analyzed according to grounded theory. – 26 articles portraying lay informants with depression (Study III) were drawn from three major Swedish daily newspapers by a search of database Mediearkivet 2002. The articles were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. – 82 scientific articles concerning depression in relation to gender were identified in a PubMed search 2002. The understanding of depression in these articles was explored and compared with findings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grown-up patient narratives and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>portrayals</b> by means of discourse analysis (Study IV). Findings Study I captured women’s and men’s formulations of their experiences of depression. To be marked with demands constituted a central experience for both women and men, but the outward manifestations differed in relation to gender as well as to class. Home and work had different priority. Men talked more about physical distress (often chest pain) than about emotions. Women readily verbalized emotional distress – shame and guilt – while physical symptoms were vague and secondary (often about the stomach). Men dealt with insecurity by aggrandizing their previous competence, women by self-effacement. Study II disclosed gendered trajectories into depression. Four symbolic illness narratives were identified: struck by lightning, nagging darkness, blackout and slowly suffocating. Most of the men considered their bodies suddenly “struck” by external circumstances beyond their control. The stories of women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study were more diverse, reflecting all four illness narratives. However, the women had a tendency to blame their own personality and to describe depression as insidious and originating from the inside. The women expressed feelings of guilt and shame but also conveyed a personal responsibility and concern with relationships. Study III identified four themes in <b>media</b> <b>portrayals</b> of depression: displaying a successful facade, experiencing a cracking facade, losing and regaining control and explaining the illness. The mediated image of depression both upheld and challenged traditional gender stereotypes. The women’s stories were more detailed, relational, emotionally oriented and embodied. The portrayal of men was less emotional and expressive, and described a more dramatic onset of depression. Study IV revealed gaps in how depression in relation to gender is understood by <b>the</b> patients, <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> and <b>the</b> medical research establishment. There were differences in recognition, <b>in</b> understanding of <b>the</b> reasons, and <b>in</b> contextualization of depression. Although women and men described different symptoms and reasons for falling ill, in scientific articles these gendered differences were conceptualized mainly in terms of hormones and other biological markers. Study V elucidated the impact of gender on adolescent depression. The young women and men were all striving to be normal, influenced by demanding media images, confronted by identity trouble, and overwhelmed by feelings. They had dreams of an ordinary family and described normative expectations. Getting a safety net of friends and other adults was a way out. Both the young women and men were eager to communicate their distress when given the opportunity. This seemed especially important to some of the young men, who in talking about their emotional problems transgressed gender norms. Conclusions Patient perspectives enrich the understanding of gendered expressions of depression by making visible transgressions of and breaks with stereotype gender norms. Gender awareness is an important key in clinical consultation. To recognize gendered narratives of illness might have a salutary potential, making depression more visible among men, and relieving self-blame among women. By re-evaluating restrictive gender patterns, the clinician might encourage development of healthier practices of how to be a man or a woman, a development especially important for adolescents. An integrated model for understanding biological, gender and cultural aspects of depression has yet to be developed. As general practitioners we have a unique possibility to see and to study <b>the</b> whole individual <b>in</b> her social and cultural context...|$|R

Although {{there are a number of}} factors that contribute to the occurrence of an eating disorder, one thing is clear: <b>the</b> <b>media’s</b> <b>portrayal</b> of <b>the</b> perfect body shape, adds to the occurrence of eating disorders <b>in</b> adolescent girls. <b>The</b> concept of regulating such advertisements has been examined by researchers, psychologists, and sociologists, all of whom suggest a link between <b>the</b> <b>media’s</b> <b>portrayal</b> of women and eating disorders in adolescent girls. This article will be the first to clearly demonstrate how advertisements in teen magazines fall outside the protections of the First Amendment, thereby legally justifying regulations. As such, this article will be the first of its kind to provide the legal justifications for regulating <b>the</b> <b>media’s</b> <b>portrayal</b> of women...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>portrayal</b> of chongas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> can, however, be problematic, {{sometimes}} even repressive, as powerful negative images contribute to Latinas internalizing pressure to conform which originates from the dominant Anglo-American culture. Stereotypical representations of chongas {{can play a}} role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States' wider culture wars, adding to concerns about the sexuality of some Latina women being [...] "out of control" [...] with their perceived high rate of reproduction. Citing earlier work by Isabel Molina Guzmán, Hernandez relates this to the Elián González affair, where <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>portrayal</b> of Marisleysis González as having the chonga-like characteristic of emotional excess contributed to the degradation of the privileged, [...] "model minority status" [...] that Cuban Americans had previously enjoyed.|$|R
