5|$|Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward {{that it is}} {{a perfect}} {{opportunity}} for his business rival, Plankton to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard so he does not have to pay for a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the <b>freezer</b> where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open <b>freezer</b> door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the <b>freezer.</b> The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that {{there is a way to}} escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system. While finding their way through the maze of air vents, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.|$|E

40|$|Technological Institute, {{manufactured}} {{and tested}} 50 ice cream <b>freezers</b> using hydrocarbon (HC) as refrigerant (propane – R 290) and 25 standard ice cream <b>freezers</b> using R 404 A as refrigerant. Both types of <b>freezers</b> {{use the same}} cabinet and the same components in the refrigeration system. The only {{difference between the two}} types of <b>freezers</b> is the refrigerant. These 75 <b>freezers</b> have been field tested in Australia; first during the 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Sydney and afterwards in service stations, shops and supermarkets in Sydney and Brisbane. During the field tests, each cabinet was fitted with two temperature data loggers to record the temperature inside and outside the cabinet, as well as a power meter to record energy consumption. This paper presents the results from the two field tests. Based on the two field tests, it can be concluded that the new HC <b>freezers</b> operate satisfactorily. Based on the measurements from the two field tests, it can furthermore be concluded that the new HC <b>freezers</b> use approximately 9 % less energy than the standard R 404 A <b>freezers...</b>|$|R

It is also sometimes served at room temperature. Clam dip can be served in a hollowed-out loaf of bread, such as sourdough. It can be garnished with ingredients such as parsley, scallions and paprika. Crudités to accompany the dish can include red peppers, carrots, radishes, and cauliflower, among others. Prepared clam dip can be preserved by storing it in a <b>freezer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Babe {{is invited}} {{to return to work}} by Linda and is pleased when Abi is sacked after making an error. Babe visits Sylvie, who now lives with Tina, and belittles her. Later in the evening, Babe is locked in the Vic's kitchen <b>freezer</b> by an unknown assailant, {{although}} Linda and Whitney discover Babe and she makes a quick recovery. Linda accuses Claudette of being the culprit so Claudette exposes Babe's blackmailer secret to her. Mick and Linda are mortified, but forgive Babe. She later informs her family that Sylvie locked her in the <b>freezer,</b> but it transpires that Abi is the culprit and Babe realises this, but wants to readmit Sylvie into a care home. Linda later demands Babe return the money to the Cokers to avoid police interference, but Babe neglects the task so Mick warns her. She tries to earn the money by gambling and blackmailing Abi, but she mocks Babe's desperation. Linda issues Babe with a final warning so Babe decides to go to the bank, however she is delayed by Lee. Linda grows tired and evicts Babe, despite her returning all of the money. They later have a heart-to-heart where Babe explains that the money was placed into a bank account for Linda's infant son, Ollie Carter (Charlie) and says how she is cruel because it makes her feel better. Linda subsequently allows Babe to move back into the Vic.|$|E

40|$|Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and {{freezing}} of gait (FOG) (<b>freezers)</b> demonstrate high gait variability. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine whether <b>freezers</b> display a higher variability of upper limb movements and elucidate if these changes correlate with gait. We were the first group to compare directly objectively measured gait and upper limb movement variability of <b>freezers</b> between freezing episodes. Patients with objectively verified FOG (n = 11) and PD patients without FOG (non-freezers) (n = 11) in a non-randomized medication condition (OFF/ON) were analyzed. Uncued antiphasic finger tapping and forearm diadochokinetic movements were analyzed via three-dimensional ultrasound kinematic measurements. Gait variability of straight gait was assessed using ground reaction forces. <b>Freezers</b> had shorter stride length (p = 0. 004) and higher stride length variability (p = 0. 005) in the medication OFF condition. Movement variability was not different during finger tapping or diadochokinesia between the groups. There was a trend towards more freezing of the upper limb during finger tapping for the <b>freezers</b> (p = 0. 07). Variability in stride length generation and stride timing was not associated with variability of upper limb movement in <b>freezers.</b> Our findings demonstrate that: (1) <b>freezers</b> have a higher spatial gait variability between freezing episodes; (2) freezing-like episodes of the upper limb occur in PD patients, and tend to be more pronounced among <b>freezers</b> than non-freezers for finger tapping; (3) spatial and temporal upper extremity variability is equally affected in <b>freezers</b> and non-freezers in an uncued task. Upper limb freezing is not correlated to lower limb freezing, implicating a different pathophysiology...|$|R

When the police squad arrives, LaGuerta confirms that Doakes' case was indeed a crime of passion. Dexter arrives at Rita's apartment, where she expresses interest in taking their relationship to a more intimate level, under the impression that this is what Dexter wants. Dexter feels uncomfortable and is saved when Rita's son, Cody, gets sick next door and needs his mother to pick him up. When Dexter arrives home, he finds a doll's head on his refrigerator door. Inside the <b>freezer,</b> he finds the other parts of the doll, severed just like the bloodless bodies of the dead women. Dexter views the doll as an invitation to play, which he accepts gladly.|$|E
5|$|Porcini {{are sold}} fresh in markets {{in summer and}} autumn in Central and Southern Europe, and dried or canned at other times of the year, and {{distributed}} worldwide to countries where they are not otherwise found. They are eaten and enjoyed raw, sautéed with butter, ground into pasta, in soups, and in many other dishes. In France, they are used in recipes such as cèpes à la Bordelaise, cèpe frits and cèpe aux tomates. Porcini risotto is a traditional Italian autumn dish. Porcini are a feature of many cuisines, including Provençal, and Viennese. They are used in soups and consumed blanched in salads in Thailand. Porcini can also be frozen—either raw or first cooked in butter. The colour, aroma, and taste of frozen porcini deteriorate noticeably if frozen longer than four months. Blanching or soaking and blanching as a processing step before freezing can extend the <b>freezer</b> life up to 12 months. They are {{also one of the}} few mushroom species pickled and sold commercially.|$|E

40|$|The {{environmental}} footprint of ultra-low temperature (ULT) <b>freezers</b> {{as used in}} bio-repositories, universities and other research organizations is investigated. These <b>freezers,</b> employing the cascade refrigeration system, use between 10 and 20 times the energy of an average household refrigerator/freezer. In addition, they often require high greenhouse gas potential (GWP) refrigerants. A new technology employing the Stirling cycle machine promises to reduce energy consumption of ULT <b>freezers</b> by 50 % or more. The cascade and Stirling systems are compared for equivalent sized <b>freezers</b> in terms of embodied energy and equivalent CO 2 production from cradle to gate and use, including total equivalent warming impact (TEWI) estimations.

5|$|Abi {{gets her}} job back at The Queen Vic and celebrates with Lauren and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Lee's {{pregnant}} fiancée. Abi drunkenly confesses to Lauren about her one-night stand with Lee, so she urges Abi {{to confess to}} Whitney, as Whitney has caught chlamydia from Lee. Abi does so but this results in much resentment. Babe emotionally blackmails Abi, forcing her to resign. Abi exposes Babe's secrets to the pub's landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) with Whitney defending her, so he tells Abi that she can keep her job, but this causes tension when she is later threatened by Babe. However Abi struggles to work on her own and so Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) is forced to ask Babe back to help her. Abi then persistently bickers about an order and lack of hygiene so blames it on Babe. Angry with Abi's behaviour, Linda sacks her. Abi locks Babe in the kitchen <b>freezer</b> room {{as an act of}} revenge, although Babe frames her sister Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) who she strongly dislikes and has Alzheimer's disease. Abi is then reinstated at the Vic by a seemingly apologetic Babe but her behaviour, when alone in the kitchen with Abi, is threatening. Babe later leaves Walford after being thrown out by her family, so Abi runs the kitchen alone. Abi forms a friendship with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) when she moves in with Ben and Jay, and Donna convinces Abi to move in as well, though she feels bad about leaving Dot on her own, but Dot gives her blessing when Donna reveals that Abi wants to move out. Abi is inwardly resentful of Lauren's success and, following Lauren's secret abortion of which Abi was made aware, Abi tells Lauren's partner, Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) that they would make a good couple during a heart-to-heart, but he tells her she is too young to be a mother. On Father's Day, feeling second best to Lauren and wound up during an argument with Steven, Abi reveals the abortion. Lauren is jealous when her boss, Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), flirts with Abi, which leads to an argument, with Abi throwing a drink over her sister and then evicting her from the party. Later, the tension simmering between Abi and Steven leads to them having sex, even though he warns her it will mean nothing. Abi and Steven continue an affair and Abi learns that Steven is lying about having a brain tumour so that Lauren will not leave him. Despite being against the idea, Abi does not tell Lauren as Steven promises Abi he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. Then Abi is stunned by Steven's public marriage proposal to Lauren. Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) overhears Abi and Steven talking about their relationship and confronts them. Abi then discovers she is pregnant by Steven.|$|E
5|$|Jill {{begins to}} work for {{cosmetics}} company Jabot and its owner, John Abbott (Jerry Douglas), promotes her to head of merchandising, impressed by her work. They become involved, but she cheated on him with his son, Jack Abbott (Terry Lester). John dumped her and she filed a sexual harassment suit worth $10,000 against Jack when {{he will not be}} with her. She reunites with John and they married in 1982. However, Abbott family housekeeper, Mamie Johnson (Veronica Redd), seemed to be a thorn in Jill's new marriage. Mamie, who wants to protect John, kept and eye on Jill, who had another affair with Jack. Katherine gets a hold of pictures of Jack and Jill and showed them to John, who has a stroke. Jill divorced John in 1986 and gets 20% of Jabot in their settlement, and a seat {{on the board of directors}} after threatening to sell her story turning it into a novel or film. Jill strives at her business, but is later found in her shower having been shot, just as her son Phillip returned to town after years away at boarding school. The three main suspects in the shooting are John, Jack, and Katherine. Jack confesses so that his affair with her won't become public. The real culprit is Sven, a masseur at the Genoa City Hotel. He had been rejected by Jill earlier in the night and shot her after getting drunk. Sven kidnaped Jill and locked her in a meat <b>freezer.</b> Jack rescued her and Sven escaped. Jill and Katherine fight over her son Phillip, who is now a teenager and had a past of acting out. Phillip turned to alcoholism but quit with help from Jill and Katherine. Phillip has sex with Nina Webster (Tricia Cast) and she ends up pregnant. He later died after driving under the influence, devastating both women. Jill hired a former con man Rex Sterling (Quinn Redeker) to seduce Katherine. Rex's real name was Brian Romalotti, father of Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian) and Gina Roma (Patty Weaver). He married Katherine, but Jill then wanted Rex for herself and convinced him to divorce Katherine. In reality, Katherine had been replaced by a look alike Marge Cotrooke who pushed Rex away. He divorced her, and married Jill, but the real Katherine finally returned and reunited with Rex. Rex eventually was shot and killed while Jill began romancing John again.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionWe {{asked whether}} {{conflicting}} visual cues influences gait initiation, gait inhibition and postural control in Parkinson’s disease (PD) between <b>freezers,</b> non-freezers and healthy older adults. MethodsTwenty-five PD participants on dopaminergic medication and 17 healthy older adults {{were asked to}} initiate or refrain gait depending on visual cues: green GO (GG), green STOP (GS), red GO (RG), red STOP (RS). Center of pressure (CoP) displacement, variability and mean velocity (VCoP) in the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions and movement time (MT) were measured. ResultsGait initiation: Both <b>freezers</b> and non-freezers were different from controls in GG and GS. In GS, <b>freezers</b> had smaller CoP displacement and velocity in both directions (p< 0. 01), while non-freezers had smaller VCoP in AP and ML (p< 0. 01). AP CoP displacement in GS was smaller in <b>freezers</b> compared to non-freezers (p< 0. 05). <b>Freezers</b> had longer MT compared to controls in GG and compared to both groups in GS (p< 0. 01). Gait inhibition: Controls and <b>freezers</b> had larger CoP displacement variability (p< 0. 05) and velocity (p< 0. 01) in both directions in RG compared to RS. No differences were seen in non-freezers. Three <b>freezers</b> initiated walking during the RG or RS conditions. ConclusionFreezers were in general slower at initiating gait, displayed a more restrictive postural strategy and were more affected by the conflicting conditions compared to both controls and non-freezers. In <b>freezers,</b> the conflicting visual cues may have increased the cognitive load enough to provoke delays in processing the visual information and implementing the appropriate motor program...|$|R
