The League expanded its purview, founding the Group Health Association of America and the National Association of Housing Cooperatives.|$|E

Avro engineers explored swept-wing and tail modifications to the CF-100 known as the CF-103, which had proceeded to wooden mock-up stage. The CF-103 offered improved transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. However, the basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and the advantages were continually eroded. When a CF-100 broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952, interest in the CF-103 waned.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> era, the Haflinger was indiscriminately crossed {{with other}} breeds and some {{observers}} feared the breed was in renewed danger of extinction.

Interest in the breed increased {{in other countries}} and between 1950 and 1974 the population grew, even while the overall European horse population decreased. Population numbers continued to increase steadily and as of 2005, almost 250,000Haflingers existed worldwide. There are breeding farms in several countries, {{although most of the}} breeding stock still comes from Austria. In 2003, a Haflinger became the first horse to be cloned, resulting in a filly named Prometea.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> period, Lawton {{underwent}} tremendous growth {{during the}} late 1940s and 1950s, leading city officials to seek additional water sources to supplement existing water from Lake Lawtonka.

Lake Ellsworth, named for a former Lawton mayor, soft-drink bottler C.R. Ellsworth, was dedicated in the early 1960s. It offered additional water resources, but also recreational opportunities and flood control along Cache Creek.|$|E
5|$|The Regia Marina demobilized {{after the}} end of the war in 1918 and the {{draw-down}} continued into the 1920s in large part due to severe budgetary shortfalls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> period. The engines installed on Nino Bixio and her sister proved to be problematic throughout her time in service, which ultimately cut her career short. She was stricken from the naval register on 15 March 1929 and subsequently broken up for scrap; in contrast, the much more efficient Quarto, which had been built before Nino Bixio, remained in service for another decade.|$|E
