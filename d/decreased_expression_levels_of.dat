In this study we assessed BBB disruption in bEnd. 3 cells after exposure {{to a range of}} OGD periods, and also after OGD + RO. Exposure of bEnd. 3 monolayers to 4, 6, 16, or 24 hours of OGD resulted in a significant increase in permeability. The hyperpermeability after 16 or 24 hours was associated with decreased expression of tight junction proteins (occludin and claudin- 5). Furthermore, there was a decrease in cell viability and increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein, cleaved caspase- 3. Exposure of bEnd. 3 monolayers to 1 hour OGD+ 23 hours RO exacerbated hyperpermeability relative to 1 hour OGD, which was associated with <b>decreased</b> <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> occludin and ZO- 1, but no change in cell viability or caspase- 3. 4 hours OGD + 23 hours RO exacerbated hyperpermeability, <b>decreased</b> <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> tight junction proteins, decreased cell viability, and increased caspase- 3 expression. Thus, bEnd. 3 cells exhibit hyperpermeability, a loss of tight junction proteins, and undergo cell death, after exposure to prolonged periods of OGD. Moreover, they exhibit exacerbated hyperpermeability, a loss of tight junction proteins, and increased expression of caspase- 3 after OGD + RO. These findings will facilitate the use of this cell line in studies of BBB disruption and for the testing of therapeutics...|$|E

Animal models of BPD using MV-O 2 to trigger disease development lead to defective vasculature and alveolar structure accompanied by decreased VEGFA/VEGF-R 2 signaling [28, 29]. According to the “vascular hypothesis of lung development,” endothelial cell signaling is a crucial pre-requisite {{for the formation of}} the alveolar structure [30]. In line with this, the use of a VEGF receptor inhibitor in animal models of BPD hinders both pulmonary angiogenesis and alveolar development, resulting in reduced lung weight [31 – 33]. In this process, VEGF holds an important role impacting on endothelial and epithelial cell signaling [34, 35]. Indicating the severely disturbed signaling process in BPD patients, studies in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of BPD patients show significantly reduced VEGF levels [36], in line with genetic polymorphism in the VEGF gene associated with disease development [37].

Chowiseungcheng-tang (CST), a herbal formulation, is frequently used to treat metabolic disorders. Here, we investigated the anti-obesity effect of CST and its link with brain-gut-adipose axis using C 57 BL/ 6 J mice as a model. The animals were provided with a normal research diet (NRD) or high-fat diet (HFD) in absence or presence of CST or orlistat (ORL) for 12 weeks. CST had a significant anti-obesity effect {{on a number of}} vital metabolic and obesity-related parameters in HFD-fed mice. CST significantly <b>decreased</b> the <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> genes encoding obesity-promoting neuropeptides (agouti-related peptide, neuropeptide Y), and increased the mRNA <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> obesity-suppressing neuropeptides (proopiomelanocortin, cocaine-and amphetamine-regulated transcript) in the hypothalamus. CST also effectively <b>decreased</b> the <b>expression</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> gene encoding obesity-promoting adipokine (retinol-binding protein- 4) and increased the mRNA <b>level</b> <b>of</b> obesity-suppressing adipokine (adiponectin) in visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Additionally, CST altered the gut microbial composition in HFD groups, a phenomenon strongly associated with key metabolic parameters, neuropeptides, and adipokines. Our findings reveal that the anti-obesity impact of CST is mediated through modulation of metabolism-related neuropeptides, adipokines, and gut microbial composition...|$|R

In our study, a <b>decreased</b> <b>expression</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Nhx 1 gene was detected in S. salsa exposed to medium concentration (10  μg L- 1) of cadmium at the first sampling time. It implied that one-week exposure of 10  μg L- 1 of cadmium impaired the normal homeostasis of Na+ around the membrane, and decreased the salt-tolerance ability of S. salsa. But as time elapsed, a normal balance was re-gained in the M group at the second sampling time-point. And significant enhancement of Nhx 1 transcripts occurred in response to high concentration (50  μg L- 1) of cadmium. Previous transgenic studies revealed that overexpression of Nhx gene could significantly enhance the plants’ salt-tolerance ability (Qian and Zhang 2007). Therefore, the result suggested that two-week exposure to 50  μg L- 1 of cadmium induced higher salt-tolerance ability in S. salsa. But this kind of effect disappeared at the third sampling time-point. It was probably another presentation of adaptive response of S. salsa to continuous cadmium exposure.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Saikosaponin-d (Ssd) is a triterpenoid saponin {{derived from}} Bupleurum falcatum L., {{which has been}} shown to exhibit a variety of {{pharmacological}} properties, including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antiviral properties. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of Ssd on the differentiation, maturation and function of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) isolated from condylomata acuminata patients. The results of the present study demonstrated that Ssd reduced the differentiation of DCs, as evidenced by <b>decreased</b> <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cluster of differentiation (CD) 1 a, CD 80 and CD 86 molecules and increased CD 14 expression. Expression levels of the mannose receptor and CD 32 were also significantly elevated, which was associated with enhanced fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran endocytic activity. Furthermore, Ssd treatment promoted DC maturation by increasing the expression levels of CD 40, CD 83, CD 80 and CD 86. In addition, the function of mature DCs, including the secretion of IL- 12 and the stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation, was significantly increased following Ssd administration. In conclusion, the present study indicated that Ssd exhibited immunomodulatory effects and may be a novel potent chemopreventive drug candidate for the treatment of condylomata acuminata...|$|E

Large amounts of MSCs can be obtained from human amnion. Therefore, we investigated the effect of transplantation of human amnion-derived MSCs (hAMSCs) or enema of conditioned medium (CM) from hAMSCs into rats with 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) -induced colitis. In the first experiment, 10 -week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were intravenously injected with hAMSCs (1 × 10 ^ 6 cells) 3 h after rectal administration of TNBS (45 mg/kg). In the second experiment, rats with TNBS-induced colitis received CM by enema into the colon for 3 days. Colitis was investigated by endoscopy, histology, immunohistochemistry, and by measuring mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators. Administration of hAMSCs or CM enema significantly improved the endoscopic score. In addition, these two interventions resulted in significantly decreased infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages and <b>decreased</b> <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> TNF-α, CXCL 1, and CCL 2. In conclusion, transplantation of hAMSCs and CM enema provided significant improvement in rats with TNBS-induced colitis.

40|$|Gut-associated {{lymphoid tissue}} (GALT) {{is an early}} target for human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection and is a site for severe CD 4 + T-cell depletion. HIV-associated enteropathy is well-documented in chronic HIV- 1 infection. However, the initial host responses to HIV infection in GALT and the early molecular correlates of HIV enteropathogenesis have not been characterized during primary HIV infection. In this study, we provide evidence of viral replication in GALT resident CD 4 + T cells and macrophages in primary-stage patients and identify early patterns of host mucosal responses {{and changes in the}} molecular microenvironment through gene expression profiling. High levels of viral replication in GALT and marked CD 4 + T-cell depletion correlated with <b>decreased</b> <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> genes regulating epithelial barrier maintenance and digestive/metabolic functions. These changes coincided with a marked increase in the transcription of immune activation-, inflammation-, and apoptosis-associated genes. Our findings indicate that HIV-induced pathogenesis in GALT emerges at both the molecular and cellular levels prior to seroconversion in primary HIV infection, potentially setting the stage for disease progression by impairing the ability to control viral replication and repair and regenerate intestinal mucosal tissues...|$|E
40|$|The {{atypical}} {{protein kinase}} C (aPKC) -partition-defective (PAR) complex regulates {{the formation of}} tight junctions and apico-basal epithelial polarity. To examine the role of this complex in the epidermis, we generated mutant mice harboring epidermal-specific deletion of aPKCλ (conditional knock-out (cKO)), {{a major component of}} the aPKC-PAR complex. The mutant mice exhibited abnormal hair follicle (HF) cycling, progressive losses of pelage hairs and vibrissae, and altered differentiation into the epidermis and sebaceous gland. We found that in the aPKCλ cKO mice HF stem cell (HFSC) quiescence was lost, as revealed by the <b>decreased</b> <b>expression</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> quiescence-inducing factors (Fgf 18 and Bmp 6) produced in Keratin 6 –positive bulge stem cells. The loss of quiescence dysregulated the HFSC marker expression and led to the increase in Lrig 1 -positive cells, inducing hyperplasia of the interfollicular epidermis and sebaceous glands, and drove an increase in Lef 1 -positive matrix cells, causing a prolonged anagen-like phase. Persistent bulge stem cell activation led to a gradual depletion of CD 34 - and α 6 integrin–positive HFSC reservoirs. These results suggest that aPKCλ regulates signaling pathways implicated in HFSC quiescence...|$|R

Glomerulonephritis was induced in rats by intravenously injecting HSV at 3 mg/kg. Renal tissue was isolated and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for <b>expression</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> type IV collagen, heat shock protein 47 (HSP 47), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and matrix metalloproteinase- 3 (MMP- 3), {{as well as its}} transcription factor Ets- 1. <b>Expression</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> HSP 47, TGF-β, and type IV collagen began to increase in the mesangial area starting from day 14 and peaked on day 21, followed by a gradual <b>decrease.</b> <b>Expression</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> MMP- 3 and Ets- 1 started to increase coinciding with peak production of mesangial matrix on day 21, peaking on day 35, followed by gradual <b>decrease.</b> <b>Expression</b> of MMP- 3 and Ets- 1 persisted until day 63, whereas that of HSP 47 and type IV collagen returned to baseline level at this time point. Time-course changes of extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation in glomeruli in the HSV-induced glomerulonephritis model were correlated with those of factors involved in both ECM production and degradation systems. Continued expression of factors in the degradation system seems particularly important for the repair process. These findings might lead to new therapies that prevent and repair glomerular injury...|$|R
40|$|Plant steroid hormones, {{brassinosteroids}} (BRs), {{are essential}} for normal photomorphogenesis. However, the mechanism by which light controls physiological functions via BRs is not well understood. Using transgenic plants carrying promoter-luciferase reporter gene fusions, we show that in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) the BR-biosynthetic CPD and CYP 85 A 2 genes are under diurnal regulation. The complex diurnal expression profile of CPD is determined by dual, light-dependent, and circadian control. The severely <b>decreased</b> <b>expression</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> CPD in phytochrome-deficient background and the red light-specific induction in wild-type plants suggest that light regulation of CPD is primarily mediated by phytochrome signaling. The diurnal rhythmicity of CPD expression is maintained in brassinosteroid insensitive 1 transgenic seedlings, indicating that its transcriptional control is independent of hormonal feedback regulation. Diurnal changes in the expression of CPD and CYP 85 A 2 are accompanied by changes of the endogenous BR content during the day, leading to brassinolide accumulation at {{the middle of the}} light phase. We also show that CPD expression is repressed in extended darkness in a BR feedback-dependent manner. In the dark the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the bioactive hormone did not increase; therefore, our data strongly suggest that light also influences the sensitivity of plants to BRs...|$|R
