5|$|In {{competitive}} inhibition, {{the substrate}} and inhibitor cannot bind to the enzyme {{at the same}} time, {{as shown in the}} figure on the right. This usually results from the inhibitor having an affinity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>active</b> <b>site</b> of an enzyme where the substrate also binds; the substrate and inhibitor compete for access to the enzyme's active site. This type of inhibition can be overcome by sufficiently high concentrations of substrate (Vmax remains constant), i.e., by out-competing the inhibitor. However, the apparent Km will increase as it takes a higher concentration of the substrate to reach the Km point, or half the Vmax. Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the real substrate (see examples below).|$|E
5|$|In mixed inhibition, the {{inhibitor}} {{can bind to}} {{the enzyme}} {{at the same time}} as the enzyme's substrate. However, the binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate, and vice versa. This type of inhibition can be reduced, but not overcome by increasing concentrations of substrate. Although it is possible for mixed-type inhibitors to bind in the active site, this type of inhibition generally results from an allosteric effect where the inhibitor binds to a different site on an enzyme. Inhibitor binding to this allosteric site changes the conformation (i.e., tertiary structure or three-dimensional shape) of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>active</b> <b>site</b> is reduced.|$|E

30|$|The result {{shows that}} H 2 PO 4 − {{is a more}} {{powerful}} inhibitor than NO 3 −. As the ion concentration increases, the removal efficiency of diazinon decreases from 86 to 48.9 % and from 94.56 to 65.67 %, respectively, with H 2 PO 4 − and NO 3 −. Such behavior {{is due to the}} interaction between the biosorbent surface and added solutes which may compete <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> and consequently block the diazinon biosorption. In addition, the inhibition of these ions is probably due to the existence of repulsive forces anion/diazinon.|$|R

50|$|A {{few of the}} {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as the dextro-enantiomer of citalopram appear to be allosteric reuptake inhibitors of serotonin.

40|$|Abstract. Nickel porphyrins {{serve as}} models <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>active</b> <b>sites</b> of several {{biological}} processes. Crystallographic and EXAFS results for a Ni meso-tetrapropyl porphyrin (NiTPrP) yield different Ni-N distances in solution {{and in the}} solid state. The Ni-N distances determined by single crystal polarized XAS and X-ray diffraction agree well. Polarized XANES experiments further establish that the pre-edge feature observed in square planar Ni(II) complexes is a ls- 4 pz transition. The single crystal and solution EXAFS results demonstrate that conformational variations of the porphyrin macrocycle can readily be imposed by environmental and/or packing forces and can thereby modulate the chemical and physical properties of porphyrinic chromophores and prosthetic groups...|$|R

50|$|The Flp protein, {{much like}} Cre, is a {{tyrosine}} family site-specific recombinase. This family of recombinases performs its function via a type IB topoisomerase mechanism causing the recombination of two separate strands of DNA. Recombination {{is carried out}} by a repeated two-step process. The initial step causes {{the creation of a}} Holliday junction intermediate. The second step promotes the resulting recombination of the two complementary strands. As their family name suggests, a highly conserved tyrosine nucleophile cleaves the DNA strands. The nucleophilic properties of the tyrosine attack and bind to the 3'-phosphate at the point of DNA cleavage. The resulting 5'-hydroxyl group of the cleaved DNA acts as the nucleophile and attacks the 3'-phosphate on the complementarily cleaved DNA strand, resulting in successful recombination. Outside of the tyrosine residue, there is a conserved catalytic pentad. This pentad is made up of a lysine (Lysβ), two arginines (Arg I and II), a histidine (His-II), and a histidine/tryptophan (His/Trp-III) that comprises a mandatory and highly conserved constrellation of residues <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>active</b> <b>site</b> of Flp and Cre (along with other IB topiosomerases). These other residues are crucial to the correct orientation of Flp binding and positioning on the DNA strands.|$|E
