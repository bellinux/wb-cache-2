25|$|The Khmelnytsky Uprising was the {{beginning}} of a long period of internal crisis in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The <b>external</b> <b>situation</b> also deteriorated, because of the increased strength of Sweden, Russia, Prussia and the Ottoman Empire. Being forced to simultaneously fight on the Baltic and Ukrainian fronts, the Commonwealth incurred significant territorial losses, even though for the time being its existence was not realistically threatened. The Commonwealth was regarded by main European states, including France of Louis XIV, as a regional power and valuable partner, necessary component of the European balance of power. This perception was being reinforced by military victories, especially under the Hetman and then King John III Sobieski.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamental}} {{premise of}} REBT is humans {{do not get}} emotionally disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct their views of these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, themselves and others. This concept has been attributed {{as far back as}} the Roman philosopher Epictetus, who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity. In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply this premise by learning the A-B-C-D-E-F model of psychological disturbance and change. The A-B-C model states that it is not an A, adversity (or activating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral Cs, consequences, but also what people B, irrationally believe about the A, adversity. A, adversity can be an <b>external</b> <b>situation,</b> or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.|$|E

40|$|The role {{of emotion}} has been underestimated {{in the field}} of robotics. We claim that {{emotions}} have a twofold aspect relevant to the building of a purposeful active robot: a cognitive aspect and a phenomenological one. We need to understand both these aspects. With regard with the first of them, it is possible to split it by at least two other relevant points. First, emotions could be the basis for binding between internal values and different <b>external</b> <b>situations</b> following the somatic marker theory. Second, emotions could play a crucial role, during development, both for taking difficult decisions whose effects are not immediately verifiable both for the creation of more complex behavioral functions. Thus emotions can be seen, from a cognitive point of view, as a reinforcement stimulus and in this respect, they can be modeled in an artificial being.

60|$|In Tom's <b>external</b> <b>situation,</b> at this time, there was, as {{the world}} says, nothing to {{complain}} of Little Eva's fancy for him--the instinctive gratitude and loveliness of a noble nature--had led her to petition her father {{that he might be}} her especial attendant, whenever she needed the escort of a servant, in her walks or rides; and Tom had general orders to let everything else go, and attend to Miss Eva whenever she wanted him,--orders which our readers may fancy were far from disagreeable to him. He was kept well dressed, for St. Clare was fastidiously particular on this point. His stable services were merely a sinecure, and consisted simply in a daily care and inspection, and directing an under-servant in his duties; for Marie St. Clare declared that she could not have any smell of the horses about him when he came near her, and that he must positively not be put to any service that would make him unpleasant to her, as her nervous system was entirely inadequate to any trial of that nature; one snuff of anything disagreeable being, according to her account, quite sufficient to close the scene, {{and put an end to}} all her earthly trials at once. Tom, therefore, in his well-brushed broadcloth suit, smooth beaver, glossy boots, faultless wristbands and collar, with his grave, good-natured black face, looked respectable enough to be a Bishop of Carthage, as men of his color were, in other ages.|$|E

While Jadid retained the allegiance of most of the civilian Ba'ath apparatus, Assad as defense minister gradually asserted control over the military wing of the party.

5000|$|Trait {{activation}} {{theory is}} a personality theory of work performance {{based on the}} concept of trait activation, that is derived from an integration of trait theory, situationism, and personality-job fit theory. [...] Trait theory is a psychological approach that includes studying personality traits as relatively stable individual differences that describe general predispositions or predictable common patterns of thinking and experiencing emotions that influence behavior. In fact, personality traits have been associated with important life outcomes (see Personality and life outcomes). The most well-known description or categorization of personality traits is called the [...] "Big Five personality traits" [...] which includes five broad personality dimensions: conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, openness, and neuroticism (or emotional stability). In personality psychology there has been a long-standing person-situation debate wherein trait theorists suggested behavior could be predicted by analyzing consistent personalities across situations, but [...] "situationists" [...] disagreed that personalities were as consistent as trait theorists suggested. Situationists argued that the <b>external</b> <b>situation</b> - not general traits - was what influenced behavior. Today, most personality psychologists adhere to an interactionist perspective, where both person and situation contribute to human behavior; as a result, the primary debate no longer exists.|$|E
5000|$|After {{summing up}} this critique, Hume {{develops}} a [...] "more particular" [...] case against rationalism, recalling his system's {{two kinds of}} reasoning: [...] "the comparing of ideas" [...] and [...] "the inferring of matter of fact". Now as for demonstrative reasoning, the four abstract relations from Book 1 seem perfectly irrelevant to morality, and indeed {{it is hard to}} see how any relation could have just the right scope (holding only between someone's psychology and <b>external</b> <b>situation)</b> and the right practical implications as well (somehow it must be certain a priori that no rational being could consider these relations without being motivated accordingly). Consider the immorality of parricide and incest: this cannot consist merely in the abstract relations at play, for the very same relations can be found in perfectly non-moral contexts involving inanimate objects and animals. And as for probable reasoning, Hume famously contends that we observe nothing in an action besides its ordinary non-moral qualities—experience reveals no moral qualities unless one looks to the moral feelings in one's own mind, so that virtue and vice are (like the secondary qualities of modern philosophy) [...] "not qualities in objects, but perceptions in the mind".
