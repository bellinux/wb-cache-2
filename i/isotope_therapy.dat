In many of the patients, with follow-up ranging up to 6 years, there were no recurrences of the tachycardia subsequent to the <b>isotope</b> <b>therapy.</b> Two patients were considered refractory to this therapy. IN THE euthyroid patient, rapid supra-ventricular tachyeardias occur and are often resistant to prophylactic treatment with quinidine or pronestyl. ' In an attempt to evaluate the effect of radioactive iodine in cases of supraventricular tachycardia resist-ant to antiarrhythmnic drugs, the authors treated 25 such patients with radioactive iodine and observed them for periods up to 6 years. 2 In all instances prophylactic treat-ment with antiarrhythmic drugs had failed to prevent recurrent attacks. Twenty-two of these patients had arteriosclerotic heart dis-ease and 3 had rheumatic heart disease. Manv of the patients had recurrent attacks as often as 4 times a day. In many instances, during the paroxysm oe tachycardia, the patient suf-fered severe anginal discomfort. All pa-tients were considered euthyroid {{on the basis of}} clinical examination by 3 physicians and normal laboratory findings, including serum protein-bound iodine and radioactive iodine uptake. The patients with arteriosclerotic heart dis-ease were selected from private practice.

To reduce the frequency of bleeding in the ankle joint of children with hemophilic arthropathy, low dose external beam irradiation was performed for 37 patients. Among them, 35 patients followed-up for longer than 1 yr (median 87 months) were enrolled for analysis. The average number of bleedings per month was 3. 6 during one year prior to radiation therapy. After radiation therapy, it was decreased to 2. 1 during the first year, after then it was maintained {{in the range of}} 1. 0 to 1. 5 until the tenth year. The bleeding frequency was reduced to 42 % at the first year and it was maintained in the range of 58 % to 73 % from the second to the tenth year.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{combined}} {{application of}} potent beta-emitting <b>isotopes</b> for <b>therapy</b> with remitting <b>isotopes</b> for scintigraphy requires a profound regimen concerning team member safety and radionuclide quantification. METHODS: We have developed {{materials and methods}} for a proper and easy manipulation of 90 Y during preparation and administration of 90 Y/ 111 In pharmaceuticals used for radioimmunotherapy. RESULTS: The efficacy of the shielding measures is documented. Protocols for the calibration of gamma-dose calibrators with respect to 90 Y are extended to the assessment of quench-corrected liquid scintillation counting of 90 Y. The contribution of 90 Y backscatter to 111 In counting is quantified. Newly developed shielding equipment allows an adequate administration of relatively large volumes (100 ml) of 90 Y/ 111 In labeled pharmaceuticals to patients.

40|$|Neocytolysis is a {{recently}} described physiologic process effecting selective hemolysis of young {{red blood cells}} in circumstances of plethora. Erythropoietin depression appears to initiate the process, providing rationale to investigate its contributions to the anemia of renal disease. When erythropoietin therapy was withheld, four of five stable hemodialysis patients demonstrated Cr- 51 red cell survival patterns indicative of neocytolysis; red cell survival was short in the first 9 days, then normalized. Two of these patients received oral (13) C-glycine and (15) N-glycine and showed pathologic enrichment of stool porphyrins by the most recently ingested <b>isotope</b> when EPO <b>therapy</b> was held. This confirms selective hemolysis of newly-released red cells. (One patient had chronic hemolysis by isotope studies of blood and stool.)

40|$|IEEE-USA {{believes}} that maintaining an accurate {{record of a}} patient’s cumulative exposure to ionizing radiation can be of substantial value for clinical, health services management and research purposes. Excessive radiation can cause cancer, skin and bone marrow disease {{and a variety of}} other diseases. Radiation exposure can come from a number of sources, both natural and manmade. Over the lifetime of the individual, medical procedures, such as X-rays, Computed Tomography (CT) scans, and <b>isotope</b> radiation <b>therapy,</b> contribute significant radiation dosages. Monitoring the use of radiological procedures, measuring the radiation dose directly, and recording the dose in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) can help assess and reduce the risk posed by excessive radiation while optimizing the diagnostic value of these procedures. With these risks and benefits in mind, IEEE-USA recommends the following: 1. Health Level Seven International (HL 7), the global authority responsible for standards for interoperability of health information technology, should add the appropriate "dose object " radiation parameters, as defined in the IHE Radiology Technical Framework Supplement, Radiation Exposure Monitoring (REM), to HL 7 /CDA format longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), to create a longitudinal record of a patient's exposure to radiation resulting from medical procedures. These records should note both the procedure and estimated radiation dose from each procedure. 2. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONCHIT) should make radiation dose monitoring a part of meaningful use criteria for EHRs. 3. Healthcare accreditation organizations (JCAHO, NCQA and URAC), in collaboration with the American College of Radiologists (ACR), should continu...|$|R
40|$|Preclinical {{research}} into radionuclide therapies based on radiation dosimetry {{will enable the}} use of any LET-equivalent radionuclide. Radiation dose and dose rate have significant influence on dose effects in the tumour depending on its radiation sensitivity, possibilities for repair of sublethal damage, and repopulation during or after the therapy. Models for radiation response of preclinical tumour models after peptide receptor radionuclide therapy based on the linear quadratic model are presented. The accuracy of the radiation dose is very important for observation of dose-effects. Uncertainties in the radiation dose estimation arise from incomplete assay of the kinetics, low accuracy in volume measurements and absorbed dose S-values for stylized models instead of the actual animal geometry. Normal dose uncertainties in the order of 20 % might easily make the difference between seeing a dose-effect or missing it altogether. This is true for the theoretical case of a homogeneous tumour type behaving in vivo {{in the same way as}} its cells do in vitro. Heterogeneity of tumours induces variations in clonogenic cell density, radiation sensitivity, repopulation capacity and repair kinetics. The influence of these aspects are analysed within the linear quadratic model for tumour response to radionuclide therapy. Preclinical tumour models tend to be less heterogenic than the clinical conditions they should represent. The results of various preclinical radionuclide therapy experiments for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy are compared to the outcome of theoretical models and the influence of increased heterogeneity is analysed when the results of preclinical research is transferred to the clinic. When the radiation dose and radiobiology of the tumour response is known well enough it may be possible to leave the current phenomenological approach in preclinical radionuclide therapy and start basing these experiments on radiation dose. Then the use of a gamma ray-emitting radionuclides for a chemically comparable beta-particle-emitting paired <b>isotope</b> for <b>therapy</b> evaluation would be feasible...|$|R

The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate all these calibration methods, compare their performance, and propose a practical and accurate calibration method for SPECT quantitation of therapeutic radioisotopes. Twenty-one phantom experiments (Siemens Symbia SPECT/CT) and 12 Monte Carlo simulations (GATE v 6.1) using three <b>therapy</b> <b>isotopes</b> (131 I, 177 Lu, and 188 Re) have been performed.

Tomographic data were reconstructed using OSEM with CT-based attenuation correction and triple energy window (TEW) scatter correction, and CF was determined using total counts in the reconstructed image, while for planar scans, the photopeak counts, corrected for scatter and background with TEW, were used. Additionally, for simulated data, CF obtained from primary photons only was analyzed.|$|R

LIBO is a RF compact and low cost proton linear accelerator (SCL type) for hadrontherapy. It is conceived by TERA Foundation as a 3 GHz Linac Booster, to be mounted downstream of an existing cyclotron in order to boost the energy of the proton beam up to 200 MeV, needed for deep treatment (~ 25 cm) in the human body. With this solution it is possible to transform a low energy commercial cyclotron, normally used for eye melanoma <b>therapy,</b> <b>isotope</b> production and nuclear physics research, into an accelerator for deep-seated tumours. A prototype module of LIBO has been built and successfully tested with full RF power at CERN and with proton beam at INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Sud (LNS) in Catania, within an international collaboration between TERA Foundation, CERN, the Universities and INFN groups of Milan and Naples. The mid-term aim of the project is the technology transfer of the accumulated know-how to a consortium of companies and to bring this novel medical tool to hospitals.

40|$|Introduction Two current major {{research}} topics in nuclear medicine {{are in the}} development of long-lived positron-emitting nuclides for imaging tracers with long biological half-lives and in theranostics, imaging nuclides which have a chemically analogous <b>therapy</b> <b>isotope.</b> As shown in TABLE 1, the radioisotopes of arsenic (As) are well suited for both of these tasks with several imaging and <b>therapy</b> <b>isotopes</b> of a variety of biologically relevant half-lives accessible through the use of small medical cyclotrons. The five naturally abundant isotopes of germanium are both a boon and challenge for the medical nuclear chemist. They are beneficial in that they facilitate a wide array of producible radioarsenic isotopes. They are a challenge as monoisotopic radioarsenic production requires isotopically-enriched targets that are expensive and of limited availability. This makes it highly desirable that the germanium target material is reclaimed from arsenic isolation chemistry. One major factor which has limited the development of radioarsenic has been difficulties in its incorporation into biologically relevant targeting vectors. Previous studies have labeled antibodies and polymers through covalent bonding of arsenite (As(III)) with the sulfydryl group 1, 2, 3. Recent work in our group has shown the facile synthesis and utility of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle- (SPION-) bound radioarsenic as a dual modality positron emission tomography (PET) /magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) agent 4. Presently, we have built upon previous studies producing, isolating, and labeling untargeted SPION with radioarsenic 4, 5. We have incorp-rated the use of isotopically-enriched 72 GeO 2 for the production of radioisotopically pure 72 As. The bulk of the 72 GeO 2 target material was re-claimed from the arsenic isolation chemical procedure for reuse in future irradiations. The 72 As was used for ongoing development toward the synthesis of targeted, As-SPION-based, dual-modality PET/MRI agents. Material and Methods Targets of ~ 100 mg of isotopically-enriched 72 GeO 2 (96. 6 % 72 Ge, 2. 86 % 73 Ge, 0. 35 % 70 Ge, 0. 2 % 74 Ge, 0. 01 % 76 Ge, Isoflex USA) were pressed into a niobium beam stop at 225 MPa, covered with a 25 µm HAVAR containment foil, attached to a water-cooling target port, and irradiated with 3 µA of 16. 1 MeV protons for 2 – 3 hours using a GE PETtrace cyclotron. After irradiation, the target and beam stop were assembled into a PTFE dissolution apparatus, where the 72 GeO 2 target material was dissolved with the addition of 2 mL of 4 M NaOH and subsequent stirring. After dissolution was completed, the clear, colorless solution was transferred to a fritted glass column and the bulk 72 GeO 2 was reprecipitated by neutralizing the solution with the addition of 630 µL [HCl]conc, filtered, and rinsed with 1 mL [HCl]conc. To the combined 72 As-containing filtrates, 100 µL 30 % H 2 O 2 was added to ensure that 72 As was in the nonvolatile As(V) oxidation state. The ~ 3 mL solution was then evaporated at 115 ˚C while the vessel was purged with argon, followed by a second addition of 100 µL H 2 O 2 after the volume was reduced to 1 mL. When the filtrate volume was ~ 0. 3 mL, the vessel was removed from heat, allowed to cool with argon flow, and the arsenic reconstituted in 1 mL [HCl]conc and loaded onto a 1. 5 mL bed volume Bio-Rad AG 1 × 8, 200 – 400 mesh anion exchange column preconditioned with 10 M HCl. The radioarsenic was eluted in 10 M HCl in the next ~ 10 mL, with 90 % of the activity eluting in a 4 mL fraction. The column was then eluted with 5 mL 1 M HCl. The 72 As-rich 10 M HCl fraction was reduced to As(III) with the addition of ~ 100 mg CuCl, and heating to 60 ˚C for 1 hour. The resulting AsCl 3 was then extracted twice into 4 mL cyclohexane, which were combined and back extracted into 500 µL of water as As(OH) 3. This solution of 72 As in H 2 O was then used directly to label SPION and for subsequent experiments conjugating 72 As-SPION with TRC 105, an angiogenesis-marking monoclonal antibody (MAb) targeting endoglin/CD 105. Several methods were initially attempted involving directly conjugating the surface-modified SPION to the MAb through a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker. More recent studies have investigated the radioarsenic labeling of SPION encapsulated in hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (SPION@HMSN) and its subsequent conjugation to TRC 105. Results and Conclusion Irradiation of pressed, isotopically-enriched 72 GeO 2 resulted in a production yield for 72 As of 17 ± 2 mCi/(µA·hr·g) and for 71 As of 0. 37 ± 0. 04 mCi/(µA·hr·g), which are 64 % and 33 %, of those predicted from literature 6, respectively. However, these production yields are in agreement with those scaled from observed production yields using analagous natGeO 2 targets. The end-of-bombardment 72 As radionuclidic purity can be improved by minimizing the 72 Ge(p, 2 n) 71 As reaction by degrading the beam energy. A 125 µm Nb containment foil would degrade impinging protons to 14. 1 MeV and is predicted to reduce 71 As yield by a factor of three, while only reducing 72 As yield by 1 % 6, improving end-of-bombardment radionuclidic purity from 98 % to greater than 99 %. Overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield of the 72 As isolation procedure from 72 GeO 2 were 51 ± 2 % (n = 3) in agreement with those observed with natGeO 2 57 ± 7 % (n = 14). The beam current was limited to 3 µA as higher cur-rents 4 – 5 µA exhibited inconsistent dissolution and reprecipitation steps, resulting in an overall yield of 44 ± 21 % (n = 6). Dissolution time also {{played an important role in}} overall yield with at least one hour necessary to minimize losses in these first two steps. The separation procedure effectively removed all radiochemical contaminants and resulted in 72 As(OH) 3 isolated in a small volume, pH~ 4. 5 water solution. Over the course of minutes to hours after back extraction, rapid auto-oxidation to 72 AsO 4 H 3 was observed. The bulk 72 GeO 2 target material, which was reclaimed from the isolation procedure, is being collected for future use. The synthesis of a targeted PET/MRI agent based on the functionalization of 72 As-SPION has proved to be a difficult task. Experiments conjugating 72 As-SPION to TRC 105 through a PEG linker were unsuccessful, despite the investigation of a variety bioconjugation procedures. Current work is investigating the use of SPION@HMSN, which have a similar affinity for 72 As as unencapsulated SPION. This new class of 72 As-labeled SPION@HMSN has a hollow cavity for potential anti-cancer drug loading, as well as the mesoporous silica surface, which may facilitate the efficient conjugation of TRC 105 using a well-developed bioconjugation technique. In summary, radioarsenic holds potential in the field of diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine. However, this potential remains locked behind challenges related to its production and useful in vivo targeting. The present work strives to address several of these challenges through the use of enriched 72 GeO 2 target material, a chemical isolation procedure that reclaims the bulk of the target material, and the investigation of new targeted nanoparticle-based PET/MRI agents...|$|R
