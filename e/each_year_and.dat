5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} Earth that orbits at uniform speed around the Sun.

For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of <b>each</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> south of it for about 180 days. The variation of orbital speed accounts for part of the equation of time.|$|E
