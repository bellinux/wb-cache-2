40|$|Understanding and anticipating {{biological}} invasions {{can focus}} either on traits that favour species invasiveness or on {{features of the}} receiving communities, habitats or landscapes that promote their invasibility. Here, we address invasibility at the regional scale, testing whether some habitats and landscapes are more invasible than others by fitting models that relate alien plant species richness to various environmental predictors. We use a multi-model information-theoretic approach to assess invasibility by modelling spatial and ecological patterns of alien invasion in landscape mosaics and testing competing hypotheses of environmental factors that may control invasibility. Because invasibility may be mediated by particular characteristics of invasiveness, we classified alien species according to their C-S-R plant strategies. We illustrate this approach {{with a set of}} 86 alien species in Northern Portugal. We first focus on predictors influencing species richness and expressing invasibility and then evaluate whether distinct plant strategies respond to the same or different groups of environmental predictors. We confirmed climate as a primary determinant of alien invasions and as a primary environmental gradient determining landscape invasibility. The effects of secondary gradients were detected only when the area was sub-sampled according to predictions based on the primary gradient. Then, multiple predictor types influenced patterns of alien species richness, with some types (landscape composition, topography and fire regime) prevailing over others. Alien species richness responded most strongly to extreme land management regimes, suggesting that intermediate disturbance induces biotic resistance by favouring native species richness. Land-use intensification <b>facilitated</b> <b>alien</b> invasion, whereas conservation areas hosted few invaders, highlighting the importance of ecosystem stability in preventing invasions. Plants with different strategies exhibited different responses to environmental gradients, particularly when the variations of the primary gradient were narrowed by sub-sampling. Such differential responses of plant strategies suggest using distinct control and eradication approaches for different areas and alien plant groups...|$|E
40|$|Global {{environmental}} changes can create novel habitats, promoting {{the growth of}} alien plants that often exhibit broad environmental tolerance and high phenotypic plasticity. However, the mechanisms underlying these growth promotory effects are unknown at present. Here, we conducted a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis using data from 111 published studies encompassing the responses of 129 alien plants to global warming, increased precipitation, N deposition, and CO 2 enrichment. We compared {{the differences in the}} responses of alien plants to the four global environmental change factors across six categories of functional traits between woody and non-woody life forms as well as C 3 and C 4 photosynthetic pathways. Our results showed that all four global change factors promote alien plant growth. Warming had a more positive effect on C 4 than C 3 plants. Although the effects of the four factors on the functional traits of alien plants were variable, plant growth was mainly promoted via an increase in growth rate and size. Our data suggest that potential future global {{environmental changes}} could further <b>facilitate</b> <b>alien</b> plant growth...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{introductions}} {{combined with}} favorable growing conditions may enhance {{the presence and}} increase the success of alien plant species in High Arctic settlements. With global warming, the presence and success of alien plants in Polar Regions might expand beyond the confinement of human settlements and cause problems for native species and ecosystems. Presence and abundance of alien and native vascular plant species were recorded, from chosen study sites, in the Svalbard settlements of Barentsburg and Longyearbyen {{during the summer of}} 2011. Soil temperature and soil nutrient concentrations measurements were also conducted in the same study sites. The effect of soil temperature attributes and soil nutrient concentrations on alien species, compared to native species, were investigated. Further, the effects of presence and abundance of alien plant species on the abundance of native plant species was investigated. The results indicated that both high soil temperature and high soil nitrogen concentrations may <b>facilitate</b> <b>alien</b> plants in Svalbard settlements. Further, the results showed that both presence and abundance of alien plant species had a negative effect on native species abundance in the study sites. This may imply that when alien plant species are facilitated, they may constitute a threat to native species abundance in High Arctic settlements. </p...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change may}} <b>facilitate</b> <b>alien</b> species {{invasion}} into new areas. This study uses Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory {{to develop a}} species distribution model (SDM) of Acacia nilotica (L.) Willd. ex Delile. based upon its naturalized distribution to project the potential distribution of A. nilotica throughout tropical environment of Indonesia under current and future climate conditions. Global biodiversity information facility database was utilized to obtain the species occurrences data. The climate factors were precipitation and temperature layers, available in Worldclim current conditions (1950 - 2000) at 2. 5 arcmin. We used Generalized Linear Model. The result was then projected to the year 2045 using RCP 8. 5 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios to influence the climate model (CSIRO Mark 3. 0. with 30 ’’ resolution). Final results show that global climate change {{is likely to increase}} markedly the potential distribution of A. nilotica in Indonesia. By the year 2045, A. nilotica is most likely to spread to eastern parts of Indonesia. In general, our model performance is good (AUC = 0. 82), however, like many other SDMs, it {{does not take into account}} biotic interactions as well as other environmental factors. Nonetheless, climatic suitability is an essential requirement for successful establishment of an invasive species and species distribution models that can disclose general patterns and convey useful estimate...|$|R
40|$|Goat grasses (Aegilops spp.) {{contributed to}} the {{evolution}} of bread wheat and are important sources of genes and alleles for modern wheat improvement. However, their use in alien introgression breeding is hindered by poor knowledge of their genome structure and a lack of molecular tools. The analysis of large and complex genomes may be simplified by dissecting them into single chromosomes via flow cytometric sorting. In some species this is not possible due to similarities in relative DNA content among chromosomes within a karyotype. This work describes the distribution of GAA and ACG microsatellite repeats on chromosomes of the U, M, S and C genomes of Aegilops, and the use of microsatellite probes to label the chromosomes in suspension by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISHIS). Bivariate flow cytometric analysis of chromosome DAPI fluorescence and fluorescence of FITC-labelled microsatellites made it possible to discriminate all chromosomes and sort them with negligible contamination by other chromosomes. DNA of purified chromosomes was used as a template for PCR using COS markers with known positions on wheat A, B and D genomes. Wheat-Aegilops macrosyntenic comparisons using COS markers revealed significant rearrangements in the U and C genomes, while the M and S genomes exhibited structure similar to wheat. Purified chromosome fractions provided an attractive resource to investigate the structure and evolution of the Aegilops genomes, and the COS markers assigned to Aegilops chromosomes will <b>facilitate</b> <b>alien</b> gene introgression into wheat...|$|R
30|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} symbiosis {{in view of}} its central role in plant-rhizosphere interactive dynamics is referred {{as the mother of}} plant root endosymbioses (Parniske 2008). These AMF may act as drivers of various ecological processes (Shah et al. 2009). The different mechanisms through which these fungi influence or are influenced by various ecological processes have been reviewed (Bonfante and Genre 2010). Urbanization and ensuing disturbances generally <b>facilitate</b> invasion by <b>alien</b> species (Dar et al. 2015) thereby causing decline in richness of plant communities.|$|R
40|$|The {{convergence}} of distinct lineages upon interspecific hybridisation, including when accompanied by increases in ploidy (allopolyploidy), is {{a driving force}} in the origin of many plant species. In plant breeding too, both interspecific hybridisation and allopolyploidy are important because they <b>facilitate</b> introgression of <b>alien</b> DNA into breeding lines enabling the introduction of novel characters. Here we review how fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) have been applied to: 1) studies of interspecific hybridisation and polyploidy in nature, 2) analyses of phylogenetic relationships between species, 3) genetic mapping and 4) analysis of plant breeding materials. We also review how FISH is poised {{to take advantage of}} nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) technologies, helping the rapid characterisation of the repetitive fractions of a genome in natural populations and agricultural plants...|$|R
40|$|An {{organizational}} chart is proposed clearly defining {{the role of}} each player {{in the arena of}} implementing the European policies on invasive alien species. The European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN) will work in partnership with European and global data providers to facilitate access to key data and information on alien species and to demonstrate the usefulness of the existing databases. Ultimately, EASIN should facilitate further support to data collection and database maintenance and sustainability. Expected key outputs of the partnership include: (1) The implementation of a data discovery portal that <b>facilitates</b> access to <b>alien</b> species data and links to the original sources of information; (2) Developing tools and web services that allow easy exploration, visualization, and best use of alien species data; (3) Facilitation of the work of national institutions to develop national lists or information compiled for reports, and support individual country’s activities, including reporting under the EU legislative framework and CBD.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of alien fish in dryland rivers potentially obstructs {{the maintenance of}} river health. Modified flow regimes are hypothesised to <b>facilitate</b> invasions by <b>alien</b> fish but in unregulated dryland rivers, large floods provide a recruitment advantage for native over alien species whereas droughts favour alien species. We tested these hypotheses by using data from a 3 -year study (2000 – 2003) of fish populations in the unmodified rivers of the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB) of Australia. Results from a lower reach of Cooper Creek were {{compared with those of}} an earlier study (1986 – 1992). During both periods, large floods occurred, with return periods ranging from 41 in 5 to 41 in 25 years. In the lower Cooper, decreases in the abundance of alien species relative to native species, and dramatic increases in recruitment of native species, were observed during a 1 – 3 -year period following large floods. In two other rivers in 2000 – 2003, there was no statistically significant change in the already low abundances of alien species. We suggest that the naturally variable hydrological regimes and native-dominant fish assemblages of the unregulated LEB rivers afford some resistance to the establishment and {{proliferation of}} alien fish through flood and drought conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{availability}} of suitable patches and {{gaps in the}} landscape is a crucial determinant of invasibility for alien plants. The type and arrangement of patches in the landscape may both <b>facilitate</b> and obstruct <b>alien</b> plant invasions, depending on whether alien species perceive the patches as barriers. In February 2000 tropical weather systems caused an extreme flood with an estimated return interval of 90 to 200  years in the Sabie River, South Africa. The impact of the 2000 flood on the Sabie River landscape provides an array of patches that may provide suitable resources {{for the establishment of}} alien plants. This study examines the distribution of alien plants in relation to patchiness of the Sabie River landscape. Our hypothesis was that if certain patches in the river landscape do not represent environmental barriers to alien plant invasion, alien species will occur preferentially in these patch types. The Sabie River within Kruger National Park [KNP] was divided into six patch types (zones, channel types, elevations, geomorphic units, substrates and flood imprint types). We then examined the distribution of native and alien woody and herbaceous density and species richness in patches. The density and species richness of alien plants in the Sabie River in KNP is very low when compared to the density and species richness of native plants. Some patches (bedrock distributary and braid bar geomorphic units) contained higher density and richness of alien plants compared to the other patches examined, indicating that these locations in the river landscape offer the resources necessary for alien plant establishment. Individual alien species are also associated with different parts of the river landscape. Failure of large numbers of alien plants to establish after the 2000 flood is most likely due to a combination of factors—the plant specific barriers imposed by landscape patchiness, the high abundance and richness of native vegetation leading to competition, and for some species certainly, the clearing by the management (Working for Water) programme...|$|R
