5|$|The main predators of the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> are Eurasian sparrowhawks and {{domestic}} cats. Some falcons will also take adults, and the Eleonora's falcon hunts the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> {{and many other}} small passerines as they migrate across the Mediterranean. Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take the eggs and young of warblers, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels. The <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The blackcap has a much lower level of parasitism than its relative because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected.|$|E
5|$|In his History of Animals, Aristotle {{considered}} that the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> eventually metamorphosed into a blackcap. The composer Olivier Messiaen used {{the song of}} the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> as the basis for his 1971 solo piano piece La fauvette des jardins, the title being the French name of the species. His Turangalîla-Symphonie, a major work inspired by the legend of Tristan and Iseult, has a summer garden scene as its sixth movement. This features {{the song of the}} warbler, along with those of the nightingale and blackbird.|$|E
5|$|The genus Sylvia, {{the typical}} warblers, forms {{part of a}} large family of Old World warblers, the Sylviidae. The {{blackcap}} and its nearest relative, the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler,</b> are an ancient species pair which diverged very early {{from the rest of the}} genus at between 12 and 16million years ago. In the course of time, these two species have become sufficiently distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera, with the blackcap in subgenus Sylvia and the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> in Epilais. These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other Sylvia species except the lesser whitethroat and common whitethroat. The nearest relatives of the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> outside the sister group are believed to be the African hill babbler and Dohrn's thrush-babbler, both of which should probably be placed in Sylvia rather than their current genera, Pseudoalcippe and Horizorhinus respectively.|$|E
5|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> is hunted by Eurasian sparrowhawks and {{domestic}} cats, and its eggs and nestlings are {{taken by a}} variety of mammalian and avian predators. It may be host to various fleas, mites and internal parasites, and it is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The large and fairly stable numbers and huge range of the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> mean that it is classed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Despite a small population decline in much of its European range, the bird's breeding distribution is expanding northwards in Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|External parasites of the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> {{include the}} fleas Ceratophyllus gallinae and Dasypsyllus gallinulae and the mite Syringophilosis borini, named after its host. Two species of {{protozoan}} parasites in the genus Isospora occur in garden warblers, I. sylvianthina and I. sylviae. Samples from two sites showed infection levels above 74% and 28% respectively {{for the two}} species. The extent of infection does not impact on the bird's body mass or the amount of body fat. Three strains of another protozoan, Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi are found only in the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler,</b> and form a monophyletic group. Seventeen further members of that group are found only in the blackcap, and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species.|$|E
5|$|The genus Sylvia, {{the typical}} warblers, forms {{part of a}} large family of Old World warblers, the Sylviidae. Fossils from France show that the genus dates back at least 20million years. The <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> and its nearest relative, the blackcap, are an ancient species pair which diverged very early {{from the rest of the}} genus, between 12 and 16million years ago. In the course of time, these two species have become {{sufficiently}} distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera, with the blackcap in subgenus Sylvia and the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> in Epilais. These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other Sylvia species except the lesser whitethroat and common whitethroat.|$|E
5|$|The male's song {{is a rich}} musical warbling, often {{ending in}} a loud high-pitched crescendo, which is given in bursts of up to 30seconds. The song is {{repeated}} for about two-and-a-half minutes, with a short pause before each repetition. In some geographically isolated areas, such as islands, peninsulas and valleys in the Alps, a simplified fluting song occurs, named the Leiern (drawling) song by the German ornithologists who first described it. The song's introduction is like that of other blackcaps, but the final warbling part is a simple alternation between two notes, as in a great tit's call but more fluting. The main song is confusable {{with that of the}} <b>garden</b> <b>warbler,</b> but it is slightly higher pitched than in that species, more broken into discrete song segments, and less mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is even more difficult to separate. The blackcap occasionally mimics the song of other birds, the most frequently copied including the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> and the common nightingale. The main call is a hard tac-tac, like stones knocking together, and other vocalisations include a squeaking sweet alarm, and a low-pitched trill similar to that of a <b>garden</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E
5|$|The nearest {{relatives}} of the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> outside the sister group {{are believed to be}} the African hill babbler and Dohrn's thrush-babbler, both of which should probably be placed in Sylvia rather than their current genera, Pseudoalcippe and Horizorhinus respectively.|$|E
5|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> has a {{very large}} range of 9,650,000km2 (3,700,000mi2), and its {{population}} in Europe is estimated at 17–31million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Asia, the total population is between 54–124million individuals. There {{is no evidence of}} any serious decline in numbers, so it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> {{was given}} the {{binomial}} name Motacilla borin by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert in 1783. The current genus name is from Modern Latin silvia, a woodland nymph, related to silva, a wood. The specific borin is derived from a local name for the bird in the Genoa area of Italy; it derives from the Latin bos, ox, because the warbler was believed to accompany oxen.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} a slight decline in numbers in Europe since 1980, {{although}} the Scandinavian population is growing. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.|$|E
5|$|Sylvia warblers are {{unusual in}} that they vigorously defend their territories against other members of their genus as well as conspecifics. Blackcaps and garden warblers use {{identical}} habits in the same wood, yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap. Similar songs are {{a feature of the}} Sylvia warblers as a group, and {{it has been suggested that}} this promotes interspecific competition and helps to segregate territories between related species. It appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species, other than the blackcap and <b>garden</b> <b>warbler,</b> is due to subtle habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{blackcap}} (Sylvia atricapilla) usually known {{simply as}} the blackcap, is a common and widespread typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, and differences between the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, black in the male and reddish-brown in the female. The male's typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the Alps. The blackcap's closest relative is the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler,</b> which looks quite different but has a similar song.|$|E
5|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> (Sylvia borin) is {{a common}} and {{widespread}} small bird that breeds in most of Europe and in western Asia. It is a plain, long-winged and long-tailed typical warbler with brown upperparts and dull white underparts; the sexes are similar and juveniles resemble the adults. Its two subspecies differ only slightly and interbreed where their ranges overlap. Due to its lack of distinguishing features, this species can be confused {{with a number of}} other unstreaked warblers. The garden warbler's rich melodic song {{is similar to that of}} the blackcap, its closest relative, which competes with it for territory when nesting in the same woodland.|$|E
5|$|The plain {{appearance}} of the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> means {{that it can be}} confused with several other species. The melodious and icterine warblers usually have long bills and a yellowish tint to their plumage. The booted warbler is similar in colour, although it is smaller, more delicately built and has a flesh-coloured bill. Western and eastern olivaceous warblers are also relatively small, and have white outer tail feathers as well as a pinkish bill. Juvenile barred warblers, which lack the obvious barring of adults, are much larger than garden warblers and have a pale double wingbar.|$|E
5|$|The only blood parasites {{found in}} a study of blackcaps trapped on {{migration}} were protozoans from the genera Haemoproteus and Plasmodium. Of those affected, 45.5% were males and 22.7% were females, but the number of parasites was small, and the ability to store fat for the migration flight was unimpaired. Seventeen strains of H. parabelopolskyi are found only in the blackcap, and form a monophyletic group; three further members of that group are found only in the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler,</b> and another three occur in the African hill babbler, supporting the shared ancestry of the three bird species. The protozoan Isospora ashmoonensis was first identified in a blackcap in Egypt. Blackcaps may carry parasitic worms that sometimes kill their hosts. External parasites include chewing lice and feather mites. The latter do little damage, although heavy infestations cause individual tail feathers to develop asymmetrically.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} breeding {{habitat in}} Eurasia is open woodland with dense low cover for nesting; despite its name, gardens are rarely occupied by this small passerine bird. The clutch {{of four or}} five blotched cream or white eggs is laid in a robust cup-shaped nest built near the ground and concealed by dense vegetation. The eggs are incubated for 11–12days. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 10days after hatching. Only about a quarter of young birds survive their first year. The <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> is strongly migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. A wide range of habitats are used in Africa, but closed forest and treeless Sahel are both shunned. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, although fruit predominates when birds are fattening prior to migration, figs being a particular favourite where available. These warblers have a mixed diet of insects and fruit in their African wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|There is a migratory {{divide in}} Europe at {{longitude}} 10–11°E. Birds {{to the west}} of this line head southwest towards Iberia or West Africa, whereas populations to the east migrate to the eastern Mediterranean and on to East Africa. Cross-breeding in captivity of birds from the resident population on the Canary Islands with migratory blackcaps from Germany showed the urge to migrate is genetically controlled, the offspring showing intermediate behaviour in terms of restlessness at migration time. Similar experiments using birds from southern Germany and eastern Austria, {{on opposite sides of the}} migratory divide, demonstrated that the direction of migration is also genetically determined. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.|$|E
500|$|Old {{names for}} the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler,</b> such as strawsmear, small straw and haychat, are often derived from its choice of nesting material, {{although}} the commonest of the English folk names was [...] "pettychaps". These names were often shared with other warblers including the blackcap, common whitethroat and common chiffchaff.|$|E
500|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> is prized as a gastronomic {{delicacy}} in Mediterranean countries. French epicure Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin {{said of the}} warbler when cooked like {{ortolan bunting}} [...] "if it were {{the size of a}} pheasant, it would be worth an acre of land". An Italian stuffed sardine dish sarde a beccafico derives its name from its supposed resemblance to the cooked birds, known in that country as beccafico, fig-pecker.|$|E
500|$|The male's song, usually {{delivered}} by birds in dense cover, {{is a rich}} musical warbling usually delivered in bursts of a few seconds duration, but sometimes for longer periods. The song is confusable {{with that of the}} blackcap, although compared to that species it is slightly lower-pitched, less broken into discrete song segments and more mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is much more difficult to separate. The most frequent call of the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> is a sharp kek-kek, which is repeated rapidly when the bird is alarmed. A quiet rasping tchurr-r-r-r resembling the main call of the common whitethroat is also sometimes heard. [...] The juvenile has a quia alarm vocalisation. The <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> will occasionally mimic other birds, and is itself frequently mimicked by the blackcap. Both Sylvia warblers will also sing against common nightingales, which have a similar song despite being unrelated. Subsong may be heard on the wintering grounds in Africa, developing into the full song in March and April prior to the return to Europe.|$|E
500|$|Aristotle, in his History of Animals, {{considered}} that the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> eventually metamorphosed into a blackcap. The blackcap's song {{has led to}} it being described as the [...] "mock nightingale" [...] or [...] "country nightingale", and John Clare, in [...] "The March Nightingale" [...] describes the listener as believing that the rarer species has arrived prematurely. [...] "He stops his own and thinks the nightingale/Hath of her monthly reckoning counted wrong". The song is also the topic of Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli's [...] "La Capinera" [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat of}} the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> is open areas with dense bushes, including thickets and woodland edges. Shady areas and a bushy or herbaceous undergrowth are preferred, as are woods adjacent to rivers or reed beds. A tolerance of willow, alder and birch {{allows it to}} breed farther north and at higher altitudes than any other European Sylvia warbler. Mature conifers and dense plantations are avoided, although young conifer plantations with thick undergrowth are suitable for nesting. Despite its name, {{it is not a}} bird of gardens. In Africa, a wide range of habitats with trees are used, although closed forests and arid areas are again avoided. This warbler occurs at altitudes of up to [...] in suitable mountain woodland, although in East Africa it is usually found at a lower altitude than the blackcap, and in moister areas than the common whitethroat.|$|E
500|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> feeds {{mainly on}} insects in the {{breeding}} season, although other small invertebrates such as spiders are also eaten. It picks its prey off leaves and twigs, sometimes hovering to do so. It normally forages {{at less than}} [...] above the ground. After nesting, there is a genetically controlled switch to a fruit diet, although insects are still consumed while the birds fatten prior to migration; birds gain weight more rapidly from a diet containing both fruit and insects than either alone. Berries and other soft fruit are preferred, and figs are particularly important for birds preparing to migrate. This predilection {{gives rise to the}} Italian beccafico (fig pecker) and Portuguese felosa-das-figueiras (fig-tree warbler) as names for this species. On this diet a bird can gain weight quickly and the liver increases the rate at which it produces fatty acids for storage in adipose tissue.|$|E
500|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> breeds {{in most of}} Europe {{between the}} [...] isotherms and east across {{temperate}} Asia to the Yenisei River in Siberia. Its range extends further north than any other Sylvia warbler. All populations are migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa {{as far south as}} South Africa. Birds from central Europe initially migrate to the southwest, reorientating to the south or southeast once in Africa, although Scandinavian migrants may head south through the Alps and across the Mediterranean Sea. S. b. woodwardi reaches Africa by a more easterly route, many birds passing through the Arabian Peninsula. When garden warblers cross the Sahara, they fly at night, resting motionless and without feeding in suitable shade during the day. During their journey, they can metabolise not only body fat but also up to 19% of their breast and leg muscles and 39% of their digestive tract. Many birds pause for a few days to feed after the desert crossing before continuing further south.|$|E
500|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> is [...] {{long with}} a [...] wing length. The weight is {{typically}} , {{but can be}} up to [...] for birds preparing to migrate. It is a plain, long-winged and long-tailed bird with unstreaked olive-brown upperparts and dull white underparts. It has a whitish eyering and a faint pale supercilium, {{and there is a}} buff wash to the throat and flanks. The eye is black, the legs are bluish-grey and the strong bill has a grey upper and paler grey lower mandible. The male and female are indistinguishable by external appearance including size. Juveniles have a looser plumage than an adult, with paler and greyer upperparts and a buff tone to the underparts. The eastern subspecies S. b. woodwardi is slightly larger and paler than the nominate form with a greyer tone to the upperparts and whiter underparts. The subspecies are hard to distinguish visually where they occur together in Africa, but a wing length greater than [...] confirms S. b. woodwardi when birds are trapped.|$|E
500|$|Garden warblers first breed {{when they}} are one year old, and are mainly monogamous, {{although}} the male at least may sometimes deviate from this. [...] When males return to their breeding areas, they establish a territory. Sylvia warblers are unusual in that they vigorously defend their territories against other species in their genus as well as conspecifics. Blackcaps and garden warblers use identical habits in the same woods, yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap. Similar songs are {{a feature of the}} Sylvia warblers as a group, and {{it has been suggested that}} this promotes interspecific competition and helps to segregate territories between related species. However, it appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species, other than the blackcap and <b>garden</b> <b>warbler,</b> is due to subtle differences in habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression. There are typically 3–9 territories per hectare (1.2–3.6 per acre), but in prime habitat, such as moist willow or birch woodland or young deciduous regrowth, there may be more than 10 pairs per hectare (4 per acre). Individual territories are similar in size to those of blackcaps at [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Park {{boasts a}} wealth of bird life, and is of ornithological {{importance}} because it supports a diverse range of birds. 141 bird species have been recorded in the park, including upland, woodland and wintering waterfowl species. Several species which are otherwise rare in Ireland are present, notably the woodland species redstart (1–2 pairs), wood warbler (1–2 pairs), and <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> (possibly up to 10 pairs). The red grouse and ring ouzel are on the IUCN Red List of species of high conservation concern (1–2 pairs each). The Greenland white-fronted goose, merlin, and peregrine are listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive. Other noteworthy species found in the park are the chough, nightjar, and osprey. The osprey sometimes passes through the park as it migrates between northern Africa and Scandinavia. Historical accounts and place names suggest that the osprey bred {{in the area in}} the past. Golden eagles once nested in the park, but were extirpated around 1900 as a result of disturbance, nest robbing, and persecution.|$|E
60|$|And {{what is that}} song, sudden, loud, sweet, yet faltering, as if half ashamed? Is it {{the willow}} wren or the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler?</b> The two birds, though very {{remotely}} allied to each other, are so alike in voice, that {{it is often difficult}} to distinguish them, unless we attend carefully to the expression. For the <b>garden</b> <b>warbler,</b> beginning in high and loud notes, runs down in cadence, lower and softer, till joy seems conquered by very weariness; while the willow wren, with a sudden outbreak of cheerfulness, though not quite sure (it is impossible to describe bird-songs without attributing to the birds human passions and frailties) that he is not doing a silly thing, struggles on to the end of his story with a hesitating hilarity, in feeble imitation of the black-cap's bacchanalian dactyls.|$|E
60|$|East of Wells Cathedral, {{close to}} the moat {{surrounding}} the bishop's palace, there is a beautifully wooded spot, a steep slope, where the birds had their headquarters. There was much to attract them there: sheltered by the hill behind, {{it was a warm}} corner, a wooded angle, protected by high old stone walls, dear to the redstart, masses of ivy, and thickets of evergreens; while outside the walls were green meadows and running water. When going out for a walk I always passed through this wood, lingering a little in it; and when I wanted to smoke a pipe, or have a lazy hour to myself among the trees, or sitting in the sun, I almost invariably made for this favourite spot. At different hours of the day I was a visitor, and there I heard the first spring migrants on their arrival--chiff-chaff, willow wren, cuckoo, redstart, blackcap, white-throat. Then, when April was drawing to an end, I said, There are no more to come. For the wryneck, lesser white-throat, and <b>garden</b> <b>warbler</b> had failed to appear, and the few nightingales that visit the neighbourhood had settled down in a more secluded spot a couple of miles away, where the million leaves in coppice and brake were not set a-tremble by the melodious thunder of the cathedral chimes.|$|E
60|$|In {{the chapter}} on the wood wren, I endeavoured to trace to its source the pleasurable {{feelings}} which the song of that bird produces in me and in many others--a charm exceeding that of many more celebrated vocalists. In that chapter {{the song of the}} willow wren was mentioned incidentally. Now, these two--wood wren and willow wren--albeit nearly related, are, in the character of their notes, as widely different as it is possible for two songsters to be; and when we listen attentively to both, we recognise that the feeling produced in us differs in each case--that it has a different cause. In the case of the willow wren it might be said off-hand that our pleasure is simply {{due to the fact that}} it is a melodious sound, associated in our minds with summer scenes. As much could be said of any other migrant's song--nightingale, tree-pipit, blackcap, <b>garden</b> <b>warbler,</b> swallow, and a dozen more. But it does not explain the individual and very special charm of this particular bird--what I have ventured to call the secret of the willow wren. After all, it is not a deeply hidden secret, and has indeed been half guessed or hinted by various writers on bird melody; and as it also happens to be the secret of other singers besides the willow wren, we may, I think, find in it an explanation of the fact that the best singers do not invariably please us so well as some that are considered inferior.|$|E
