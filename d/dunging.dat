The gard'ner would wisely have rooted him up, To stop the increase of a barbarous crop; But the master forbid him, and after the fashion Of foolish good nature, and blind moderation, Forbore him through pity, and chose as much rather, To ask him some questions first, how he came thither. Kind sir, quoth the nettle, a stranger I come, For conscience compell'd to relinquish my home, 'Cause I wouldn't subscribe to a mystery dark, That the prince of all trees is the Jesuit's bark,[2] An erroneous tenet I know, sir, that you, No more than myself, will allow to be true. To you, I for refuge and sanctuary sue, There's none so renown'd for compassion as you; And, though in some things I may differ from these, The rest of your fruitful and beautiful trees; Though your digging and <b>dunging,</b> my nature much harms, And I cannot comply with your garden in forms: Yet I and my family, after our fashion, Will peaceably stick to our own education.

He welcomes his guest, gives him free toleration In the midst of his garden to take up his station, And into his breast doth his enemy bring, He little suspected the nettle could sting. 'Till flush'd with success, and of strength to be fear'd, Around him a numerous offspring he rear'd. Then the master grew sensible what he had done, And fain he would have his new guest to be gone; But now 'twas too late to bid him turn out, A well rooted possession already was got. The old trees decay'd, and in their room grew A stubborn, pestilent, poisonous crew. The master, who first the young brood had admitted, They stung like ingrates, and left him unpitied. No help from manuring or planting was found, The ill weeds had eat out the heart of the ground. All weeds they let in, and none they refuse That would join to oppose the good man of the house.

50|$|Pigs lack {{functional}} {{sweat glands}} and are almost incapable of panting. To thermoregulate, {{they rely on}} wallowing in water or mud to cool the body. Adult pigs under natural or free-range conditions can often be seen to wallow when air temperature exceeds 20°C. Mud is the preferred substrate; after wallowing, the wet mud provides a cooling, and probably protecting, layer on the body. When pigs enter a wallow, they normally dig and root in the mud before entering with the fore-body ﬁrst. They then wriggle the body back and forth, and rub their faces in the mud so all of the body surface is covered. Before they leave the wallow, they often shake their heads and body, often ﬁnishing with rubbing against a tree or a stone next to the wallow. When indoors and hot, domestic pigs often attempt to wallow on wet ﬂoor surfaces and in the <b>dunging</b> areas.|$|E

Finding that they did not approve of <b>dunging</b> their vineyards, Tull readily adduced the fact in favour of his own favourite theory: that manuring soil is an unnecessary operation. Returning to England, he took into his own hands the farm called Prosperous, at Shalbourne, in Berkshire, where resuming the agricultural efforts he had commenced in Berkshire, he wrote his Horse-hoe Husbandry.At a later period (1730-1740), Jethro Tull devoted all his energies to promote the introduction of this machine, [...] "more especially as it admitted the use of the hoe." ...|$|E

50|$|Thus, {{also from}} the 16th century onwards up until the late 18th century, Körborn shared the same history as the now former County of Veldenz and its {{successor}} state, Palatinate-Zweibrücken. Cörbern still belonged, as before, to the Burgfrieden of Castle Lichtenberg along with the villages of Thallichtenberg, Ruthweiler and Bistert (now vanished). According to Johannes Hoffmann’s 1588 description of the Amt of Lichtenberg, Körborn lay in the ﬁfth Hauptgrund (literally “main ground”): “In this case … herein: The Cörbergrundt is 8,600 feet or 573 roods and 5 feet. In this lies above at the end or the beginning the village of Cörbern. The dell, called Müllenbach, is 5,170 feet or 344 roods and 10 feet long, falls into the Cörpergrundt”. Hoffmann used the word Schuch (in today’s German, Schuh - literally “shoe”) for “foot” and Ruttenn or Rutten for “roods”. He also identiﬁed the “dell” (he used the same word in German) with the brook running through it. According to this report, the Mühlbach was called the Cörbergrundt (or Cörpergrundt) and the Müllbach {{was said to be}} a side valley of this “ground”. It is unlikely that a mill (Mühle in German) ever stood on either of these brooks. During the Thirty Years' War, the nearby Castle Lichtenberg escaped the customary destruction, though the villages all around it suffered heavily under the horrors wrought by the war and also by the Plague. Körborn was likely utterly destroyed in this war and afterwards newly settled. Further hardship and woe came in the late 17th century with French King Louis XIV’s wars of conquest. Only in the 18th century was their steady population growth. From a report by Daniel Hinkelmann that has been preserved to the present day come details about agricultural conditions in those days. The ﬁrst survey of the municipal area known to history was done in 1745 by the Ducal Renovator Gottfried Sundahl from Zweibrücken, who determined the area to be 3,455 Morgen. According to documents from 1777 issued by the Keller (collector) at Castle Lichtenberg, Johann Christoph Gassert, the municipality then had 1,287 Morgen of cropland of which 341 Morgen lay at the municipality’s outermost edges, 245 Morgen of meadowland and 323 Morgen of woodland and grazing land. Produced were, among other things, 5,070 bales of corn straw and 2,845 bales of fodder straw. Of the cropland mentioned above, only 190 Morgen were <b>dunged,</b> which according to Gassert’s calculations yielded 3,420 sheaves of grain, and therefrom all together 213 Malter of actual grain. The 42 Morgen of stubble ﬁelds and boggier land yielded 6 sheaves to a Morgen and therefore 252 sheaves all together, and thus 15 Malter and 3 Fass (“barrels”). Of the 269½ Morgen planted with summer crops, one third with potatoes, the yield for one Morgen was 15 Malter, all together 1,350 Malter of potatoes, while 179 Morgen of barley and oats yielded 3 Malter (roughly 6 hundredweight) to a Morgen, and thus all together 537 Malter. The livestock kept in that year broke down as follows: 1 horse, 48 oxen, 43 cows, 41 other cattle, 473 wethers and other sheep, 190 lambs and 182 pigs.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Among Swedish {{consumers}} and politicians {{there is a}} wish to increase the organic pig production. Therefore, an interdisciplinary research program in organic pig production was initiated with funding primarily from FORMAS and SLU. The project (EKOPIG) {{has been carried out}} involving all of SLU, and both piglet and growing-finishing pig production were studied. Part IV within EKOPIG was carried out at SLU-Alnarp, and focused on housing systems for organic slaughter pigs. A building for organic growing-finishing production was constructed at JBT’s research farm for pig studies. The animal house had space for 128 growing-finishing pigs distributed in 8 pens of 16 pigs each. The pens were designed according to the regulations required by the EU and KRAV (with and without access to pasture). Pasture yards were established adjacent to the animal house. The labour requirements for producing slaughter pigs were documented (Table 1). It was calculated to take 32. 6 min to produce one slaughter pig during summer when the pig was housed in a pen with pasture access, and 25. 6 min where there was no access to pasture. During the winter period, the labour requirement was 26. 5 min per produced slaughter pig (Table 2). The work stress in the experimental stable was investigated using the Borg CR-scale and the EWA method. The working conditions when cleaning the outside areas (Figures 1 - 5) were experienced as requiring a lot of effort (being very strenuous), especially during the winter period. Inside the stable, the lying areas were only cleaned when necessary (Figures 6 and 7). In addition, work operations such as cleaning the alleys (Figures 8 and 9), cleaning using high pressure washing systems (Figures 10 and 11), distribution of straw (Figures 12 - 15) and weighing the animals (Figures 16 - 18) were also studied. The amount of stress experienced by different parts of the body when distributing straw was investigated using biometrical calculations. It was determined that the stress on the back/spine was three times higher when the straw was taken and lifted up from the distribution cart than when it was actually being distributed in the pen (Figures 14 b and 15 b). An estimation of the physical effort needed for the various work operations is given in Figures 19 and 20 for the organic housing system in comparison to a conventional system. The physical effort was also estimated using a checklist provided by Prevent. These results are shown in Table 3. It was determined that it was mainly the work operations involving cleaning that required more effort in the organic pig housing system than in the conventional. Among other things, this was due to the areas to be cleaned being larger. Ventilation and air quality was experienced as being better in the organic stable, whereas personnel considered the climate in the conventional stable to be better. In summary, the work efficiency in the animal house was considered to be good, with a labour requirement per produced slaughter pig being a third of that required for outside organic pig production using huts. The most “troubling” observation from the investigation of work stress was that cleaning the outside concrete areas not only required more time but was also physically harder. The fundamental idea when the stable was built was that the pigs should dung near the culvert when outside and then the pigs themselves via their physical activity should “push” the dung down into the culvert (the floor had a 10 % slant – Straw-flow system). In practice, however, on many occasions the pigs <b>dunged</b> on a much larger area when outside, and they were not active enough to push the dung into the culvert. There are practical solutions for improving this work operation. In Southern Europe slatted floors are used on half of the outside concrete area. In Sweden, however, this would result in the slats being frozen for {{a large part of the}} winter and thus their draining effect would be lost during the winter period. A solution already used in most of the organic pig herds in Sweden, is to scrape the outside concrete floor with a tractor scraper/loader at least once a week. On the other hand, the pigs have to be locked inside in order to scrape the floor clean and this will require large gates which must be opened and closed. This in turn will require a not insignificant amount of work. The concrete yards used with these solutions are often completely covered with a thick layer of dung. This is not especially stimulating or hygienic for the pigs. In addition, these large dirty areas promote a high emission of ammonia. It is a great challenge to design an outside concrete yard for pigs which is stimulating for the animals and will result in a low ammonia emission, better working environment and lower labour requirement! A solution using a peat layer on a large part of the outside floor (also under a protective roof) and a dung alley which can be scraped via machine could be one solution. More studies are needed, however, to develop appropriate solutions to this problem...|$|R
40|$|Hygiene is {{a common}} problem on outdoor runs of growing organic pigs. Manure and urine are mainly {{excreted}} outdoors and tend to spread all over the run. Reducing the soiled surface area may be beneficial to animal welfare, hygiene, ammonia emissions and labour, not only in organic but also in conventional systems. The objective was to reduce the soiled surface area in the pen {{and to make the}} outdoor run more attractive for pigs. Introduction of a rooting area and drinker in the outdoor run was tested in a 2  ×  2 factorial design. In total, four replicates were studied in a room with two rows of four pens containing 14 pigs each. More pigs went outdoors in pens with rooting area access than in pens without a rooting area (11. 2 vs. 8. 5 %, P =  0. 003). This was due to more pigs entering the rooting area and an adjacent slatted floor. Addition of a drinker did not attract more pigs outdoors (P =  0. 53). The rooting area improved the cleanliness of the whole pen (P <  0. 001). However, in some cases the rooting area was also used as a <b>dunging</b> area. The area around the additional outdoor drinker was cleaner, but on the whole, pens were dirtier (P =  0. 011). Introduction of an outdoor drinker resulted in more indoor pen fouling, especially around the indoor drinker (P <  0. 001). An outdoor rooting area makes the outdoor run more attractive for pigs and reduces the <b>dunging</b> area. This study contributes to the knowledge base on how to reduce the <b>dunging</b> surface in pens for organic pig...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{feasibility}} {{to extract the}} proportion of pigs located in different areas of a pig pen by advanced image analysis technique is explored and discussed for possible applications. For example, pigs generally locate themselves in the wet <b>dunging</b> area at high ambient temperatures {{in order to avoid}} heat stress, as wetting the body surface is the major path to dissipate the heat by evaporation. Thus, the portion of pigs in the <b>dunging</b> area and resting area, respectively, could be used as an indicator of failure of controlling the climate in the pig environment as pigs are not supposed to rest in the <b>dunging</b> area. The computer vision methodology utilizes a learning based segmentation approach using several features extracted from the image. The learning based approach applied is based on extended state-of-the-art features in combination with a structured prediction framework based on a logistic regression solver using elastic net regularization. In addition, the method is able to produce a probability per pixel rather than form a hard decision. This overcomes some of the limitations found in a setup using grey-scale information only. The pig pen is a difficult imaging environment because of challenging lighting conditions like shadows, poor lighting and poor contrast between pig and background. In order to test practical conditions, a pen containing nine young pigs was filmed from a top view perspective by an Axis M 3006 camera with a resolution of 640 × 480 in three, 10 -min sessions under different lighting conditions. The results indicate that a learning based method improves, in comparison with greyscale methods, the possibility to reliable identify proportions of pigs in different areas of the pen. Pigs with a changed behaviour (location) in the pen may indicate changed climate conditions. Changed individual behaviour may also indicate inferior health or acute illness...|$|E

We estimated the intensity of herbage removal, dung deposition and trampling after each of three grazing periods on a grid of 25 m × 25 m cells covering an entire paddock in the Swiss Jura Mountains. We found no significant positive correlations between cattle effects. Spatial patterns weakened through the season for grazing and trampling, whereas <b>dunging</b> patterns changed little between grazing periods. Redundancy analysis showed that different cattle effects were correlated with different environmental variables and {{that the importance of}} management-introduced variables was highest for herbage removal. Autocorrelograms and partial redundancy analyses using principal coordinates of neighbour matrices suggested that <b>dunging</b> patterns were more coarse-grained than the others. Systematic differences in the spatial and seasonal patterns of cattle effects may result in complex interactions with vegetation involving feedback effects through nutrient shift, with strong implications for ecosystem management. In heterogeneous environments, such as pasture-woodland landscapes, spatially explicit models of vegetation dynamics need to model cattle effects separately...|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} problem initiated this study. In the Haarlemmermeer, {{a former}} lake reclaimed about 1850, several farmers had difficulties with soil structure. Land, plowed in autumn, was very wet in spring. Free water was sometimes {{present on the}} soil surface. Planting and seeding were long delayed in spring and yields were unsatisfactory because of irregular crop development. Some farmers ascribed it to pressure from the back wheel of the tractor in the open furrow during plowing, compacting the subsoil and severely reducing permeability. Plowing practices were therefore changed. Equipment was used that could be moved by driving the tractor with all four wheels over the normal soil surface. This sometimes needed very old horse ploughs, adapted to tractors. Other farmers tried to improve drainage by laying more tile drains alongside existing systems, but usually the drains did not conduct water. The problems occurred on several soil types, but especially on the somewhat lighter textured sandy loams of the Hoofddorp Complex (Pgb) (Haans, 1954). The Agricultural extension service helped {{in the selection of}} two farms, where a pedon was selected. In one, henceforth called G, no problems occurred. In the other, called B, soil structure had deteriorated. Morphological and physical properties of each pedon were frequently investigated for about 18 months. Soil management was left to each farmer. Profile descriptions, particle size distributions and routine analytical data of each pedon are in Appendix I. Differences in these values between the two profiles are mainly a result of soil management. Originally the carbonate content of Pedon G was very low throughout. The content of 1 %, as found now in the surface soil only, results from the application of lime for 30 years. The subsoil still contains no free carbonates. On Pedon B, decalcification during the formation of the profile, caused by a vegetation (Haans, 1954) was less pronounced. At about 50 cm the profile has much lime deposited as shells and small fragments. The surface soil, however, has been decalcified. It has not been limed as much as Pedon G as is shown by the difference in pH value (Appendix I). Pedon G has been green-manured and <b>dunged</b> for at least 25 years. During the last 10 years every field of the farm has been used for the growth of grass during three years, to be followed by use as arable land for the next three years. When wheat is grown, the soil is always green-manured. The field where Pedon G is found was notoriously bad about 1930. The surface soil had a weak unstable structure. Continued investment in lime and careful management has converted it into a productive soil. Pedon B, however, is on a field whose ownership has changed several times over the last thirty years. It was never green-manured until 1966. The surface soil therefore contains less organic matter and lime than that of Pedon G. The particle size distribution of the two pedons is identical. Average yields, as roughly estimated by the farmers from varying data of several years, were different for both farms. For sugar beet a yield of 50 tons, for wheat of 5. 0 tons per ha was considered normal for farm G. For farm B this was 40 and 4. 5 tons respectively. Such uncontrollable yield values, however, are not satisfying for describing soil quality and suitability. More important therefore was the opinion of the farmers that in general, soil B seemed more susceptible to structure deterioration and offered more problems than soil G. The suitability for agriculture of soil B was therefore considered inferior to that of soil G. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate this general statement and to describe it in quantitative terms. Before discussing the results of the fieldwork and a series of model experiments, the term suitability, as used when comparing both soils, must be explained. The soil is used by the farmer to produce agricultural crops. His profit is determined by a difference between crop value and costs. A low yield may not necessarily be unfavourable, at least not when relatively high prices are being paid, as may be expected when generally low yields are found on other soils. On the contrary, in a year when average yields are high, prices tend to be lower. Then, in spite of higher yield, the amount of cash received for the crop may be lower as well, whereas costs of management will be simular. Prices, however,, not only vary as a function of the amount of supply but also because of differences in quality. Cost figures are governed by the system of management of the farmer. Certain costs are inevitable, like those for seeding or planting and those for fertilization. The procedure followed in practice and its efficiency will determine its magnitude. Others, seem less inevitable. Some tillage practices for example are subject to discussion in this regard. Each farmer will judge the quality of his land considering these factors. He will call a soil suitable when a regular and high production, both in volume and quality, is possible, especially in years when the general productivity level is low. Besides, each crop to be grown is one from a cycle of different crops grown in a specific pattern of rota-lion. His final opinion on suitability will therefore be based on a judgment, considering the degree of financial succes by which certain crops can be grown during the years as a part of a rotation, that seems most lucrative. A farmer will thus be able to give a description of the quality of each of his fields, based on experience of many years and on his own system of management that he considers to be the best. The question of suitability of certain soil types as shown on a soil map will be posed to the soil surveyer, whether he likes it or not. Access to the experience of farmers is then indispensable. A soil scientist however, will have to realize that his pattern of thinking may differ from that of the farmer. He primarly thinks in terms of well described and classified soil types, as expressed on soil maps, that have been formed in a certain parent material under influence of the soil forming factors. He digs a pit and considers one of its vertical walls. The picture obtained then is considered representative for the type of soil. A farmer thinks more in terms of management and economy. and above that in fields of landuse. A certain field will normally be covered by several soil units of the map. This is certainly true when relatively large fields are present, to enable efficient use of machinery. To get a suitability concept for a certain soil type, occurring on different farms, the soil scientist has to normalize as good as possible all factors not directly related to his object of study, the soil profile itself (Vink & van Zuilen, 1967). These factors are: the capability of the farmer, expressed by his management; landshape and accessibility of the land and the type and size of farm, as well as the usual system of crop rotation. Except for these factors it should be realized that each judgement is a clear function of the general economic situation, changing with time. Yields obtain on a certain type of soil usually vary considerably among years on the same field and also in the same year on different farms. Differences in weather during the growing season contribute to the first phenomenon, differences in soil management to the second. Modern agriculture shows many points of agreement with industry, emphasizing an increase in production for each worker. Therefore mechanization developed. In a relatively short period of time concepts of soil productivity and management have changed. Practical problems, often concerning soil structure and soil stability, are submitted ever more frequently to specialists. Their judgment, based on an analysis of farmers experience, can only be given in a rather static agricultural system. When this system changes, as is the case with the present general drive to mechanization, the answers of the past no longer satisfy. Therefore an independant analysis should be made of the soil profile and its soil material only, describing its range of variable properties as a function of soil management. This will be attempted in the next chapters for the two pedons of discussion...|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} {{presented}} at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference. Two alternative paddock rotations for dry sows were established on an organic farm: Rotational (40 x 40 m moved three times per year) and Set Stocked (120 x 40 m in place for one year). Sows showed distinct preferences in the location of <b>dunging</b> and urination within the paddocks (p< 0. 001), but no differences between the paddocks. Vegetation cover under the sows was similar overall in the two paddock systems, but showed differences over the year. Work to model the potential for nutrient leaching in the two paddock systems is ongoing...|$|E
40|$|In organic animal production, {{synthetic}} {{amino acids}} are not allowed. Therefore, {{a higher level}} of crude protein is needed in the diet to pigs, which lead to more nitrogen (N) excreted in the faeces and urine. N can be emitted to the air in the form of e. g. ammonia (NH 3), which contributes to eutrophication and acidification and as nitrous oxide (N 2 O), which is a very potent greenhouse gas. The emission of N can be reduced by e. g. modifying the diet and by reducing the defecated areas in the pens. The aim {{of this study was to}} enrich the outdoor yard in organic pig production with a rooting area filled with peat, and thereby also reduce the emissions of N. The hypothesis was that pigs avoid to dung in areas with high activity, and a rooting area should therefore direct the pigs to dung in a smaller area outside the rooting area. Peat is appreciated as a rooting material by pigs and it has a high potential to bind N, which reduces the emission of NH 3. The complex environment (aerobic and anaerobic) that can occur in peat is not always optimal, which can lead to more N emitted as N 2 O. The study was performed in a stable for organic finishing pigs in Skåne (the most southern part of Sweden). The stable consists of 8 pens, each dimensioned for 16 pigs. Two batches of pigs were studied. Studies of the pigs’ behaviour, measures of the emission of NH 3 and hygiene of the floor in the outdoor yards were included. Furthermore, as a pilot trial in batch 2, the concentration of N 2 O was measured in closed chambers with two different methods. The results showed that the pigs chose to stay outdoor and to lie outdoor to a higher extent when the climate was warmer (batch 2). During batch 1, the hygiene was poorer than in batch 2, but the emission of NH 3 was observed to be lower. The explanation for this result is that the temperature in batch 1 was lower than in batch 2. The rooting area did not stimulate the pigs to root more or be more active, but the pigs directed their rooting to be more frequent outside, and a tendency (p= 0. 097) that the pigs chose to stay outside more was observed (Table 8, 9, 10 and 11). The pigs avoided to dung in the rooting area, and their <b>dunging</b> was mostly concentrated to the <b>dunging</b> area (area C), a result that corresponds to the hypothesis. This behaviour led to better hygiene in the outdoor yard and a lower emission of NH 3 from the rooting area (49. 9 mg/m 2 h) compared to the same area in boxes without rooting area (108. 6 mg/m 2 h). However, from the <b>dunging</b> area (area C), higher emission of NH 3 was detected in pens with the rooting area (134. 8 mg/m 2 h) compared to boxes without it (80. 1 mg/m 2 h) (Table 12 and 13). Because of the few measures of the concentration of N 2 O, conclusions can not really be made. Though, the measures showed altered concentrations of N 2 O (= emission) from outdoor yards with a rooting area, compared to outdoor areas without rooting areas, where no altered concentrations was detected (Figure 12 - 15). The rooting area can be considered positive for the welfare of the pigs since it was popular both for rooting and as a lying area, and it resulted in a better utilization of all areas in the pen. Though, the higher emission of NH 3 from area C and the detected emission of N 2 O from outdoor yards with a rooting area, concludes that more actions than a rooting area are needed to reduce the total emissions of N from outdoor yards. Suggestions for other actions are more frequent cleaning (which is facilitated by concentrated <b>dunging),</b> another type of <b>dunging</b> system and maybe another rooting material or another kind of peat. To reduce the total emissions of N from dung, it is important to take into consideration both NH 3 and N 2 O in future studies...|$|E
