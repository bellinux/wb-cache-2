5|$|Crawley {{was already}} a modest {{industrial}} centre by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>World</b> War.

In 1949, 1,529 people worked in manufacturing: the main industries were light and precision engineering and aircraft repair. Many of the jobs in these industries were highly skilled.|$|E

5|$|After {{some notable}} successes and some early {{failures}} in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. The credibility of the organization was somewhat weakened {{by the fact that}} the United States never officially joined the League and the Soviet Union joined late and only briefly. Germany withdrew from the League, as did Japan, Italy, Spain, and others. The onset of the Second World War showed that the League had failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent any future world war. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations (UN) replaced it after the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>World</b> War and inherited several agencies and organisations founded by the League.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>World</b> War, {{construction}} {{began on}} the second phase, the B Station. The station came into operation gradually between 1953 and 1955. It was nearly identical to the A Station from the outside and was constructed directly to its east as a mirror to it, which gave the power station its now familiar four-chimney layout. The construction of the B Station brought the site's generating capacity up to 509 megawatts (MW), making it the third largest generating site in the UK at the time, providing a fifth of London's electricity needs (with the remainder supplied by 28 smaller stations). It was also the most thermally efficient power station in the world when it opened.|$|E
