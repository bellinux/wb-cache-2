5|$|In {{response}} to a typhus epidemic in the women's camp, Mengele cleared one block of 600 Jewish women {{and sent them to}} the gas chamber. The building was then cleaned and disinfected, and the occupants of a neighboring block were bathed, de-loused, and <b>given</b> <b>new</b> clothing before being moved into the clean block. The process was repeated until all the barracks were disinfected. Similar disinfections were used for later epidemics of scarlet fever and other diseases, but with all the sick prisoners being sent to the gas chambers. For his efforts, Mengele was awarded the War Merit Cross (Second Class with Swords) and was promoted in 1944 to First Physician of the Birkenau subcamp.|$|E
5|$|M-114 was the {{designation}} of a former state trunkline highway and planned beltline in the US state of Michigan around the city of Grand Rapids. It was designated {{by the end of}} 1929 on various streets in adjoining cities and townships. By the 1940s, sections of it on the west and south sides of Grand Rapids were <b>given</b> <b>new</b> designations and the segment along the east side of town was finished. By late 1945 the highway designation was completely decommissioned in favor of other numbers. M-114 split into two branches, one running east–west and the other running north–south. The east–west spur routing is now local streets while the rest is part of state highways.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{characters}} from other games were meant {{to have some of}} their moves changed or removed in order to balance them with KOF's new characters. However, designers focused in adjusting the imbalance of certain characters without removing any move. In the end, creators of the series noted that the Art of Fighting characters were the strongest ones in the game. Nevertheless, other characters such as Terry and Andy Bogard became the ones who got the designers' utmost attention and were <b>given</b> <b>new</b> moves.|$|E
5|$|Paid {{additional}} content was released alongside the games, {{in the form}} of extra levels used to improve the units' strength or gather exclusive resources. A series of additional storylines were also released to expand on the main narrative. The first is Before Awakening, in which the Avatar is transported to Ylisse, the setting of Fire Emblem Awakening, and aids its heroes Chrom, Frederick, and Lissa in fighting off the forces of Valla. The second, Hidden Truths, centers around Awakening characters Owain, Inigo, and Severa as they are contacted by a mysterious figure who asks for their help in saving Valla.

5|$|Su-25SM weapon suite {{has been}} {{expanded}} {{with the addition}} of the Vympel R-73 highly agile air-to-air missile (albeit without helmet mounted cuing and only the traditional longitudinal seeker mode) and the S-13T 130mm rockets (carried in five-round B-13 pods) with blast-fragmentation and armour-piercing warheads. Further, the Kh-25ML and Kh-29L Weapon Employment Profiles have been significantly improved, permitting some complex missile launch scenarios to be executed, such as: firing two consecutive missiles on two different targets in a single attack pass. The GSh-30-2 cannon (250-round magazine) has received three new reduced rate-of-fire modes: 750, 375 and 188 Rounds per Minute.

5|$|The {{general idea}} for the {{restoration}} {{was to make the}} locomotives appear as if they were built in the 1880s. The original, dilapidated boilers of the four locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works were replaced with new, smaller boilers built by Dixon Boiler Works. Their worn-out wood and steel cabs were replaced with new ones made of fiberglass, and they were <b>given</b> <b>new</b> tenders, which used the trucks from the originals. Many of the smaller original parts on the locomotives such as the domes and brass bells on top of the boilers, the wheels, and the side rods were successfully refurbished and retained. The locomotives' fireboxes were also reconfigured to burn diesel oil. Replicas of their builder plates were also made to replace the originals.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel reopened {{to service}} on September 24, 2007, with tunnel routes {{modified}} to group common destinations together. Stations were <b>given</b> <b>new</b> entrance signs, lighting fixtures, electronic passenger information signs, and restored paint. The peak bus-only restrictions on 3rd Avenue remained in {{place after the}} reopening, along with the skip-stop service that Metro implemented on the street. The tunnel was temporarily closed for nine days in December after a computer glitch disrupted the tunnel's new emergency-control system, which was repaired and replaced.|$|E
5|$|With {{the change}} of ownership, NSB also decided to replace the aging El 11 with El 17. The {{locomotives}} had been delivered in 1987 and were intended for express train service, but had been plagued with technical problems and were not considered reliable enough to operate as single locomotives. The six newest trains of the class were painted in a new green livery and branded as Flåmsbana rather than NSB. Older B3 carriages were renovated, <b>given</b> <b>new</b> panorama windows and painted in the same color scheme and taken into use on the line. In October 2000, NSB sold its shares in Flåm Utvikling to Aurland Ressursutvikling. The line received GSM-R from 1 May 2005. The same year, Nærøyfjord, the neighboring fjord to where Flåm is located, was inscribed as a World Heritage Site.|$|E

5|$|Although Buenos Aires had {{suffered}} a difficult period in its war for independence, its prospects were improving by 1812. Even though the defeats of Manuel Belgrano during the Paraguay campaign and Juan José Castelli in the first Upper Peru campaign had generated a political crisis, Belgrano's victory at Tucuman had <b>given</b> <b>new</b> fresh hope to the revolution, which would be strengthened shortly afterwards with the victory at the Battle of Salta. Montevideo, capital of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata since the May Revolution, was under siege by both an army from Buenos Aires led by José Rondeau and an Uruguayan one led by José Gervasio Artigas. The city, however, maintained its naval supremacy over Buenos Aires and their ships raided the coasts of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers to gather supplies, despite the siege. Montevideo organized a navy to destroy the gun batteries at Rosario and Diamante, two population centers along the Parana, but were prevented from doing so as Buenos Aires dismantled them knowing {{that they could not}} defend them.|$|E
5|$|Bellerophon {{returned}} to England in June, before departing {{to patrol the}} Western Approaches until September. She entered Portsmouth Dockyard again in October and underwent a refit costing £8,103. She resumed patrol and blockade duty in the Western Approaches in January 1796, at first under Cranstoun, but from April effectively under the acting-captaincy of Lieutenant John Loring. Cranstoun's replacement, Captain Henry D'Esterre Darby, arrived to take command in September. Blockade duty continued until early January 1797, when news reached the fleet that a French expedition had appeared off Ireland. Caught off guard, the Admiralty ordered Bellerophon {{and a number of}} other ships to patrol off Bantry Bay. By then the French expedition had been dispersed by bad weather, and after three weeks on patrol, Bellerophon put into Cork where she rendezvoused with the Irish squadron under Admiral Robert Kingsmill. Shortly after her return to Spithead in early March, Bellerophon was <b>given</b> <b>new</b> orders by the Admiralty. She sailed on 17 March, bound for Cadiz to join Sir John Jervis's Mediterranean Fleet blockading the port.|$|E
5|$|Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn is a live-action {{film and}} miniseries {{set in the}} Halo universe. Although shot as a feature-length film, Forward Unto Dawn was {{originally}} released as a webseries consisting of five roughly 15-minute episodes, {{the first of which}} was released on October 5, 2012, with the last episode released on November 2, 2012. The series' plot, occurring {{in the early days of}} the Human-Covenant War circa 2526, revolves around Thomas Lasky, a young cadet at Corbulo Academy of Military Science, and how John-117 inspired him to eventually become a leader. Lasky is also a prominent character in Halo 4 as a commander on the UNSC Infinity. The name of the series, aside from being a reference to the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn, is <b>given</b> <b>new</b> significance in the series as part a running motif based on a poem. The film cut was released on Blu-ray and DVD on December 4, 2012.|$|E

5|$|In Fallout Shelter, players {{build and}} {{manage their own}} Vault as an Overseer – the leader and {{coordinator}} of their Vault. Players guide and direct {{the citizens of the}} Vault, and need to keep them happy through meeting their needs such as power, food, and water. They rescue dwellers from the wasteland and assign them to different resource-generating buildings in the Vault, using the SPECIAL statistics system from the other Fallout games. Each character's SPECIAL profile affects their ability to generate different resources, and their statistics can be increased by training them in rooms devoted to each stat. The dwellers can level up over time, increasing their health, and can be <b>given</b> <b>new</b> items and weapons to help with various tasks. The number of dwellers can be increased by waiting for new dwellers from the wasteland to arrive or by pairing a male and a female dweller in living quarters to produce babies.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts II {{features}} well-known voice actors {{for both}} the Japanese and English versions. Many of the original voice actors from the first Kingdom Hearts reprised their roles; Miyu Irino and Haley Joel Osment as Sora, Mamoru Miyano and David Gallagher as Riku, and Risa Uchida and Hayden Panettiere as Kairi. New voice actors included Kōki Uchiyama and Jesse McCartney as Roxas, Iku Nakahara and Brittany Snow as Naminé, and Genzō Wakayama and Christopher Lee as DiZ. A special {{effort was made to}} preserve the official voice actors from the Disney movies used in Kingdom Hearts II. Many actors reprised their Disney roles for the game, including American actors Ming-Na, James Woods, Pat Morita (in his final voice role before his death), Bruce Boxleitner, and Zach Braff, and Japanese actors Takashi Aoyagi, Kōichi Yamadera, Yū Shimaka, and Hiroshi Fujioka. Some voice actors from the related television series or direct-to-video sequels were chosen over original voice actors where applicable, such as Robert Costanzo as Philoctetes rather than Danny DeVito. Some characters were <b>given</b> <b>new</b> voice actors in the English version; Ansem, Aerith, Leon, Sephiroth and Hercules, who were originally voiced by Billy Zane, Mandy Moore, David Boreanaz, Lance Bass, and Sean Astin respectively in the first game, were voiced by Richard Epcar, Mena Suvari, Doug Erholtz, George Newbern, and Tate Donovan (Hercules' original voice actor), and newcomer Tifa was voiced by Rachael Leigh Cook.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August, {{the ships}} were {{formally}} {{integrated into the}} Ottoman Navy while their crews were <b>given</b> <b>new</b> uniforms and formally reenlisted. The British had thought this action was meant to counterbalance their seizure of the Ottoman battleships, {{but this was not}} strictly the case. The Ottomans feared the Entente, particularly Russia, would attempt to partition the empire if they won the war, whereas Germany and Austria-Hungary would not. Once the British became aware of this, they feared that the Ottomans were more likely to enter the conflict in Germany's favour. Following Russia's failures in its operations against Germany in late August, Russian incursion in Ottoman territory seemed unlikely. Meanwhile, the Ottoman officials reached neutrality agreements with the governments of Greece and Romania while Bulgaria displayed pro-German tenancies, alleviating their fears of a Balkan threat. Enver then began to move his defensive policy towards an aggressive one.|$|E
