500|$|Hasta la Raíz is Lafourcade's sixth studio {{album and}} her first album of {{original}} material in seven years, since Hu Hu Hu (2009). It was produced by Argentinean musician Cachorro López, Mexican singer-songwriter Leonel García, and Lafourcade after another record producer became too expensive: [...] "I could not afford a very famous producer who had his fees at exorbitant figures, I won't say his name, so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> refuge on my friends , doing songs with them as accomplices, and they understood".|$|E
500|$|... "Lemme See" [...] is a mid-tempo R {{song that}} heavily {{incorporates}} synthesizers, {{and has a}} running duration of four minutes and 15 seconds. It contains elements of hip hop music, and its production was compared {{to the one in}} Kelly Rowland's [...] "Motivation" [...] (2011). Lyrically, Usher is contemplating on what he is going to do when he [...] "gets a certain female clubgoer into his bedroom", in the line: Hey girl, I’m debating if I should take you home. During the pre-chorus, he comes to the conclusion: <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> my shirt off / and show my chest.|$|E
500|$|Angel was the {{frontman}} for {{the heavy}} metal band Angel and collaborated with industrial rock musician Klay Scott for Angeldust. Angeldust released its debut album Musical Conjurings From the World of Illusion in 1998. He later released the albums System 1, System 2, and System 3. In 2003, he released the album Supernatural. His musical style {{continues to be}} in the heavy metal style, though when describing his musical style he has said, [...] "There are elements where it's more electronic, and there are orchestrated sections. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it in different places because I'm inspired by emotion and by giving people a connection, a sense of a feeling — whether it's excitement or crying or being happy." [...] He also produced soundtracks for his television series Mindfreak, including collaborations with members of Korn and Godsmack.|$|E
6000|$|... "We had a {{few words}} last night," [...] he {{explained}} [...] "and Mr. Morrison left the office with an understanding between us {{that he should not}} return. You will receive a formal intimation of that {{during the course of the}} next day or so. We will revert to the matter presently, if you wish. My immediate business with you is to discuss the fact that I have to provide something like twenty thousand pounds to-day if <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up the purchases of stock which Morrison has made." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peter, can't you {{see that}} I'm serious? <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> matters in my own hands. The {{rest of the time}} you are here, you may come to see me twice a week. I shall {{instruct}} the concierge." ...|$|R
50|$|Today we have {{certainly}} entered {{a period of}} crisis, when the arguments of 'normal times' no longer apply, when considerations of most immediate usefulness come in. That is why <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the opportunity of going to Spain.|$|R
500|$|Henderson {{would not}} accept {{the end of his}} major league career. In May 2005, he was still insisting that he was capable of playing in the major leagues. NBC and ESPN {{reported}} that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but his agent denied the report the following day. On February 10, 2006, he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets, while leaving the door open to returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he'd received to rejoin the SurfDawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he'd had enough. But six weeks later, on August 11, he claimed [...] "It's sort of weird not to be playing, but <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a year off", adding, [...] "I can't say I will retire. My heart is still in it... I still love the game right now, so I'm going to wait it out and see what happens." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by long-time collaborator Melina Matsoukas and Knowles under the alias Bee-Z. The video took two-three weeks of preparation and one day to film in Los Angeles on Mount Olympus. The main set of the video was a house owned by a wealthy 95-year-old man who allowed Knowles and Matsoukas to use his house and collectible cars for the video shoot. During an interview with USA Today on January 28, 2010, Knowles announced {{that she would be}} taking a break from her music career saying [...] "to live life, to be inspired by things again". She was then inspired to shoot a music video for the bonus track. In an interview with People magazine in August 2010, Knowles explained: [...] "I came up with the concept for that video because lately <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a break, and I’ve been home, being a wife. I figured it could be nice to give a little wink toward the things that I’ve been doing, so that’s why I’m a housewife in the video." [...] However, she explained that the video is [...] "an exaggerated, over-the-top version" [...] of what she was doing right then, just living her life, being a woman at home, relaxing and trying to enjoy her life other than performing and creating music. For instance, dusting off her Grammys and getting under the hood of a car while wearing six-inch heels are not regular occurrences for Knowles.|$|E
2500|$|In a November 27, 2006, {{review of}} a {{prototype}} Roadster in Slate, Paul Boutin wrote, [...] "A week ago, I went for a spin in the fastest, most fun car I've ever ridden in—and that includes the Aston Martin I tried to buy once. I was so excited, in fact, that <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{a few days to}} calm down before writing about it. Well, my waiting period is over, I'm thinking rationally, and I'm still unbelievably stoked about the Tesla".|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding this warning, Euphemia and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> in our sign. We {{were not}} to be frightened by a stage-driver. The next day our own driver passed us on the road as he was going down.|$|R
3000|$|... “I was so bored {{repeating the}} same {{exercise}} that <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> stop! <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the motorbike <b>to</b> {{the side of the}} track and stopped! (John, session 12) [...]...|$|R
40|$|This {{keynote speech}} was so well {{received}} that <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{the advice of}} colleagues and friends and leave it almost exactly as I delivered it. Rather than tamper with the text, I have added footnotes and references where appropriate. 1 It is indeed an honor for me to give the keynote address for AATSEEL i...|$|R
2500|$|After much thought, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{this way}} out. It took more thought than anyone can think possible. It started {{about a week}} ago, when I {{began to think of}} a {{way to get out of}} this. Running away would not do any good, the police would find me where ever I went and would bring me back to it all. No, Mother and Daddy are not to blame, it is just me. If I had done what they told to do this would have never happened. Studying instead of playing around, going out with the people in my age group instead of staying home and dreaming...." ...|$|E
60|$|After some reflecting, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> John into my confidence, {{and leave}} {{him to make the}} matter public or not, as he thought fit.|$|E
60|$|I {{also put}} on the bed a few volumes of Goethe, because I {{thought it would be}} so {{pleasant}} to read him in his own country. And <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a sponge, together with a small portable bath, because a cold bath is so refreshing the first thing in the morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "You ask me lightly," [...] he replied, [...] "but, {{if you are}} willing, <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{you into}} my confidence. Our friend Nikasti will be here to-morrow. He was to have sailed for Japan yesterday, but he has {{postponed}} his voyage for a few days. Do you {{know much about the}} Japanese, Miss Pamela?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, unexpectedly, Bob Sidney telephoned {{to her at}} {{her flat}} one evening: [...] "Partner and <b>I</b> have just <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you on, if you'll come at thirty-eight hundred a year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said; [...] "I {{must not}} let you go. In common {{gratitude}} <b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> before you leave me, and <b>I</b> do <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you into my confidence." [...] She hesitated; her color rose a little. [...] "I know how unselfishly you offer me your help," [...] she resumed; [...] "I know you speak {{to me as a}} brother might speak to a sister--" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a franc's {{worth of}} train-journey. So I chose my station. It was one franc twenty, third class. Then my train came, and Emil and I parted, he waving to me till I {{was out of}} sight. I was sorry {{he had to go}} back, he did so want to venture forth.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're not a farmer," [...] Daylight said. The {{young man}} laughed {{and shook his}} head. [...] "No; I'm a {{telegraph}} operator. But the wife and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a two years' vacation, and ... here we are. But the time's about up. I'm going back into the office this fall after I get the grapes off." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{that line}} for the present. I made a few vague affirmatives. [...] "I want help," [...] I said hoarsely. [...] "I {{want to get some}} stuff up the beach--stuff I can't very well leave about." [...] I became aware of three other pleasant-looking young men with towels, blazers, and straw hats, coming down the sands towards me. Evidently the early bathing section of this Littlestone.|$|E
60|$|There {{was no time}} to lose, however; and {{the course}} <b>I</b> {{actually}} <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> will be soonest told by relating things as they occurred. I heard the door open, and was ready for action. Whether the incendiaries intended to retreat by the cliff, or to open the gate, which was barred within, I could not tell; but I was ready for either alternative.|$|R
50|$|I {{had other}} options as well. Professionally, it's an {{experience}} that can only do me good. I {{had the chance to}} sign for three years with AG2R-La Mondiale but I had the feeling that I wasn't going to develop enough. I have always raced in France and, in my heart, some experience abroad has excited me for some time. <b>I</b> therefore <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the step and Patrick Lefévère's advances completely persuaded me.|$|R
40|$|The work of Professor P. C. B. Phillips, {{even if it}} {{is focused}} on the area of linear nonstationary models, is enormous. So it is hard for me to explore the whole of his work in this paper. Therefore <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up only a few results of his work. The topics chosen here are {{applications}} of the martingale approximation and the problem of choosing between stochastic and deterministic trends, which I discuss and, hopefully extend. ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Milly into my confidence, {{and finally}} on the {{strength}} of that I got to sleep. In the morning I went to my hotel, had breakfast, attended to my mail, and then boarded a car to go out to Milly's house. She was waiting for me on the porch, dressed as I liked to see her, in blue and white, and she wore violets that matched the color of her eyes.|$|E
60|$|I was so {{astonished}} at {{the announcement that}} I could hardly conceal my surprise; but the Doña Maria not appearing to notice it, I replied that I {{would be happy to}} serve her; at the same time, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Marjorie and go myself to the hotel. Mrs. Sanderson had urged us to come repeatedly, and I felt that now the invitation was imperative. Mariposilla should not go to the Sandersons' alone. I had instituted myself her guardian, and I would protect her not only from her inexperience, but from unscrupulous attentions, selfishly bestowed.|$|E
60|$|Now was {{come the}} time when I must decide upon what should be done, and, despite the danger, in my perplexity <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the chances of regaining Master Lord's dwelling, saying to myself that the only hope {{remaining}} was to get Seth into that place of refuge which was {{at the same time}} our prison. Once there Hiram Griffin could decide whether we would not be warranted in turning our backs upon the mission which had brought us to Boston town, and make every effort to gain Cambridge with the prisoner.|$|E
50|$|The {{conflict}} ensued {{after the}} end of the War of the League of Cambrai (1508-16), when Francesco Maria <b>I</b> della Rovere <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the situation to recover the Duchy of Urbino, from which he had been ousted in the previous year.|$|R
50|$|They had one child, a {{daughter}} named Kaohelelani. She was verging into maidenhood when he died. His people showed their affection by making his grave {{on the highest}} peak, Kauwiki. When news of his death reaching his half-brother Kamehameha <b>I,</b> he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his fatherless niece into his court and for their brother Kealiimaikai to hold Kaohelelani's land inheritances until she reached majority. However, when Kamehameha conquered Kalanikupule, King of Maui, he partitioned the land out to the chiefs who had aided him.|$|R
2500|$|On May 26, Oswald {{wrote to}} the New York City {{headquarters}} of the pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee, proposing to rent [...] "a small office at my own expense {{for the purpose of}} forming a FPCC branch here in New Orleans." [...] Three days later, the FPCC responded to Oswald's letter advising against opening a New Orleans office [...] "at least not ... at the very beginning." [...] In a follow-up letter, Oswald replied, [...] "Against your advice, <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> an office from the very beginning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing particular, only he is a {{delicate}} boy. At first I refused him, but he is so well-made, though delicate, and such a good-looking child, and so spirited, that <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him; but he {{turns out to be}} too spirited. Nothing that I can do will tame him,--oh, that won't do it," [...] said Yoosoof, observing that Marizano raised the switch he carried in his hand with a significant action; [...] "I have beaten him till there is scarcely a sound inch of skin on his whole body, but it's of no use. Ho! stand up," [...] called Yoosoof, letting the lash of his whip fall lightly on the boy's shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] said Colonel Blaylock, {{pausing to}} arrange the queen's wrap. [...] "I did not invest in Okochee. I have made an {{exhaustive}} study of business conditions, and I regard old settled towns as unfavorable fields in which to place capital that is limited in amount. Some months ago, through the kindness of a friend, there came into my hands a map and description of this new town of Skyland that has been built upon the lake. The description was so pleasing, {{the future of the}} town set forth in such convincing arguments, and its increasing prosperity portrayed in such an attractive style that <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the opportunity it offered. I carefully selected a lot in the centre of the business district, although its price was the highest in the schedule--five hundred dollars--and made the purchase at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|The last Hudson Bay trading steamer was due {{at about}} this time and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> passage to Fort Wrangell with Ladrone, who was almost as fat and {{handsome}} as ever. Two weeks of delicious grass had done wonders for him. I knew that every horse driven through to Teslin Lake would be turned out to freeze and starve {{at the end of}} the trail, and I could not think of abandoning my brave pony to such a fate. He had borne me over mud, rocks and streams. He had starved and shivered for me, and now he was to travel with me back to a more amiable climate at least. [...] "I could never look my readers in the face if I left him up here," [...] I explained to my partners who knew that I intended to make a book of my experiences.|$|E

It has been an unbelievable ride and I am so grateful for the support and love along the way. My last show will be November 23 at Gruene Hall. I look forward to supporting these guys alongside you as they continue down the road.” [...] The band continued performing as a four-piece group.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, I {{think it}} would be best to leave them. They are well {{established}} here now, and have come to be looked upon by those around them as having left the tribe altogether and as intending to work as carriers. I should tell one or other of them to go into the town every day, and see how matters are going on.
