25|$|Liddell {{was chosen}} to speak for Glasgow Students' Evangelistic Union {{by one of the}} GSEU's co-founders, D.P. Thomson, because he was a devout Christian. The GSEU hoped that he would draw large crowds to hear the Gospel. The GSEU would send out a group of eight to ten men to an area where they would stay with the local population. It was Liddell's <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lead speaker and to evangelize to the men of Scotland.|$|E

Alex is prepared {{to give up his}} <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with Kathy but she has second thoughts and considers moving to Cape Town, South Africa to live with her brother Ted Hills (Brian Croucher). Her upcoming departure spurs proposals from not only Alex but Phil's brother Grant, who asks her to elope, and Phil, who tries to reunite with her. Kathy grows confused by so many options but eventually tells Phil she is open to a reunion with him. However, he fails to meet her on the day of her planned departure, so Kathy leaves Walford with Ben.|$|E

It found that while that act was constitutionally protected, the {{balancing}} test established by Pickering v. Board of Education actually improved the MTA's case under Mt. Healthy, since although it was speech on {{a matter of public}} concern it was disruptive to the MTA's operations since it breached the confidentiality the plaintiff was required to maintain about security matters and internal investigations as part of his job duties. Even {{if it had not been}} so disruptive, the court held, his record of insubordination and deception of several of the defendants was enough reason for him to have been disciplined and fired—indeed he had even admitted he believed his <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in jeopardy before he had contacted the Times.|$|E

25|$|Aiken was 6ft tall as a teenager, and {{owing to}} this was elected Lieutenant {{of the local}} Irish Volunteers. He got his first taste of {{politics}} helping Éamon De Valera in the Clare election of July 1917, while an active Sinn Féin officer of Camlough Club. At the rowdy by-election at Bessbrook in February 1918, Aiken was elected a Captain of Volunteers, stewarding electioneering. As Comhairle Ceanntair it was <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> chief fund-raiser for the Dublin Executive, responsible for the Dáil Loan, {{the first to be}} issued by the Dáil Éireann. He was quickly promoted through the ranks, rising to Commandant of Newry and then brigadier of 4th Northern. The area he controlled extended to northern County Louth, southern and western County Down, parts of Counties Tyrone and Antrim, and all of County Armagh, from at least March 1921.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the show}} {{documented}} the housemates as they {{struggled to find}} and maintain jobs and careers in their new locales, with minimal group activities aside from their day-to-day lives {{in the house and}} their socializing in the city. The only group activity engineered by the producers during the first season was a trip for the three females to Jamaica. By the second season, sending the entire cast on a vacation and/or short-term local trip would become the norm for most seasons. By the fifth season, the cast would be given an ongoing, season-long activity, with the Miami cast given startup money and a business advisor to begin their own business. This aspect of the show remained in most subsequent seasons. The assignments are obligatory, with casts assigned to work at an after-school daycare program, a radio station, public-access television station, etc. Beginning with the , a rule was implemented that required a roommate fired from the group <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evicted from the house and dropped from the cast. 's Greg Halstead and 's Joey Rozmus were evicted from their respective houses after they were fired from their group jobs. Beginning in the 28th season, certain jobs in the area were approved by production that the cast had the liberty to apply for independently if desired.|$|E
25|$|Himani Singh {{is played}} by Gurdeep Punj. She is Avatar's wife {{and the mother of}} Rohan, Dolly, Sunny, Nikki, and Bobby. She works as a {{hospital}} nurse and is often portrayed as dutiful, protective, and comedic. She loves her family and does everything to care for and protect them. She appears out of her element when she isn't nurturing them, especially Nikki, but as the series progresses, she begins to feel assured that her youngest children are in good hands and trusts that her husband and three elder children can look after Nikki and Bobby. She is notoriously conceited and enjoys bragging about her accomplishments, be they admirable, real, or otherwise. Himani used to work on the local news team and was also a poet in her high-school days. A running gag on the show is that she was involved in virtually every extracurricular activity at Arya College of Arts and Science, but still earned a nursing degree. She lets special opportunities go to her head, such as being on TV or singing in front of a group. She has a habit of taking any chance at publicity that may shine on her family to focus on her, but this never works out well; usually she ends up being cut from the project or tossed out of certain groups. Himani seldom accepts her children's misbehavior. It is revealed in the third special that she is pregnant again with her fifth child. In the middle of the third season, Himani quit her nursing <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a stay-at-home mother to Nikki and Bobby. Himani is the equivalent of Amy Duncan in Good Luck Charlie, who {{is played by}} Leigh-Allyn Baker.|$|E

Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles), a South Wales Police officer, is recruited into the organisation by its leader, Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), in the premiere episode but due to the pressures of her work keeps it a secret from her boyfriend, trucking manager, Rhys (Kai Owen). He believes reports of alien sightings to be a result of hallucinations induced by psychotropic drugs in the water supply and Gwen's <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> working in [...] "special ops".

Robert later makes an effort to discourage Rocky from fighting, blaming his own personal failings on his father's celebrity shadow, but Rocky rebukes him with some profound advice; that to succeed in life, [...] "it ain't about how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward", and that blaming others won't help him. The next day, father and son meet over Adrian's grave and reconcile; Robert has quit his <b>job</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at Rocky's side. Rocky sets straight to training with Apollo Creed's old trainer, Duke, who quickly surmises that the slow and arthritic Rocky can only compete by building his strength and punching power as much as possible.|$|E
