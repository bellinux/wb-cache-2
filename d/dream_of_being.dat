The competition between the Japanese colonial Government-General and the native Taiwanese elite in the course of its modernization draw many young Taiwanese <b>dream</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> artists in a way of provoking improvement of their social status or cultivation of new knowledge which is more suitable to a modern society.
