5000|$|In 2015 the Regional Schools {{commissioner}} {{wrote to}} Ian Comfort the CEO of Academies Enterprise Trust {{stating that the}} educational standards are unacceptably low at Millbrook Academy. He stated: while the academy has improved aspects of educational provision, further <b>improvement</b> <b>is</b> needed {{and the rate of}} <b>improvement</b> <b>is</b> too slow... it <b>was</b> clear that <b>improvements</b> <b>were</b> being made but significant issues remain and are likely to continue for the foreseeable future...|$|R
50|$|The park {{initially}} {{opened to}} the public in 2003. However, the majority of the athletic fields and other facility <b>improvements</b> <b>were</b> not completed until 2009, after $15 million in <b>improvements</b> <b>were</b> made to the property.|$|R
5|$|In 2017, Network Rail {{proposed}} an upgrade of Marylebone with 1,000 extra seats on trains approaching the station. These <b>improvements</b> <b>are</b> {{planned to be}} complete by 2024. Beyond this, improvements to Old Oak Common station are planned to relieve congestion at Marylebone.|$|E
5|$|The Chickasaw Turnpike {{has been}} fully {{automated}} since shortly after it opened. As Governor Bellmon predicted, {{it has been}} a consistent money loser since opening. <b>Improvements</b> <b>are</b> funded largely through proceeds from the more profitable Turner and Will Rogers Turnpikes.|$|E
5|$|With the {{construction}} of American Dream Meadowlands, several <b>improvements</b> <b>are</b> taking place to Route 120. The interchange with Route 3 is being reconstructed with an overpass between eastbound Route 3 and northbound Route 120 that was completed in May 2009 {{at a cost of}} $38.1 million. Also, a flyover from southbound Route 120 to eastbound Route 3 was completed in early 2010 at a cost of $13 million.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Figures 6, 7, and 8 that our {{proposed}} Algorithm 1 always achieves the highest performance. Compared to RAM-RB, Algorithm 1 enables the primary user to receive higher average revenue (where the maximum <b>improvement</b> <b>is</b> about 43 %). Furthermore, Algorithm 1 also enables the secondary users to achieve higher average sum utilities (where the maximum <b>improvement</b> <b>is</b> about 300 %) and sum capacities (where the maximum <b>improvement</b> <b>is</b> about 32 %) than the other schemes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Improvement</b> <b>is</b> {{the process}} of a thing moving from one state to a state {{considered}} to be better, usually through some action intended to bring about that better state. The concept of <b>improvement</b> <b>is</b> important to governments and businesses, {{as well as to}} individuals.|$|R
5|$|<b>Improvements</b> <b>are</b> {{being made}} to Union Station, which is the busiest {{passenger}} transportation facility in Canada, {{and is expected to}} have its current passenger traffic double in the next 10 to 15 years. Improvements currently underway include a new roof and glass atrium covering the platforms and railway tracks, new passenger concourses, additional staircases and vertical access points and general visual improvements to the station. Other longer term options such as a second downtown station and/or connections to a future Relief Subway Line are also being studied to meet future demand.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, a {{study on}} {{improving}} the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel by either building another tube or by constructing a bypass was carried out. Based on the study, the turnpike commission planned to replace the deteriorating tunnel with a cut through the mountain. The plans were put on hold in 2001 because it would cost $93.7 million. It resurrected the project in 2009. The nearby Mountain Field and Stream Club prefers that the tunnels are improved or a new tube is built rather than building the bypass. These <b>improvements</b> <b>are</b> needed because the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel is narrow and deteriorating, with disintegrating ceiling slabs and outdated lighting and ventilation.|$|E
5|$|The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has {{identified}} the NY146 corridor from Riverview Road to Glen Ridge Road as {{in need of}} future improvements. Intersection <b>improvements</b> <b>are</b> scheduled at the NY146/ Aqueduct Road/ Williams Road and NY146/ Riverview Road intersections. This {{part of the project}} will be built in 2008 and is to include new turn lanes at each intersection. To the south, the Rexford Bridge over the Mohawk River and the surrounding roadway will be improved in stages, with completion expected by 2017. The objective of these projects is to improve highway capacity and safety along the corridor.|$|E
50|$|During the Tudor dynasty, {{continental}} invasion still threatened. During {{the reign}} of Henry VIII <b>improvements</b> <b>were</b> made to Dover's defences, both to the castle and the Moat Bulwark; the king making a personal visit to supervise the work. Further <b>improvements</b> <b>were</b> carried out under Elizabeth I.|$|R
50|$|Phenytoin {{has been}} used in the {{management}} of Australian stringhalt. Two weeks after treatment with phenytoin, significant <b>improvement</b> <b>was</b> observed in the gait abnormality of horses affected with Australian stringhalt at the trot and canter, but no significant <b>improvement</b> <b>was</b> observed at the walk or while turning.|$|R

5|$|The roadway {{remained}} {{open through}} the use of alternate lane closures during the work until April 12, 2014, affecting the 74,000 daily crossings. The rehabilitation project, with an estimated cost of $1.2–1.5billion, is being done in phases and spread out over ten contracts, the first of which began in 2012, and the last, for final painting of the steel structure, planned for completion in 2020. The <b>improvements</b> <b>are</b> expected to extend the life of the bridge until at least 2095.|$|E
5|$|West of Aspen {{the highway}} follows {{the route of}} an early Colorado Midland Railroad route from the city to Glenwood Springs. Paved during the 1930s, this road has been {{gradually}} expanded to four lanes {{over the course of}} the 20th and early 21st centuries. The increased traffic resulting from Aspen's economic rebirth as a resort town has required high-occupancy vehicle lanes, bypasses and the replacement of at least one old bridge. More <b>improvements</b> <b>are</b> planned for both Aspen and Glenwood Springs.|$|E
5|$|MDSHA has {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} east–west corridor between the MD 28–MD 97 intersection at Norbeck and the I-95–MD 198 interchange, a corridor that forms the most direct route from Laurel to Rockville. Plans for the MD 198 portion of the corridor call for expanding the route to a four-lane divided highway from MD 650 to US 29 and widening the highway to six lanes from the Montgomery–Prince George's County line to west of I-95. The proposals also include adding a center turn lane to MD 198 between Old Columbia Pike and the Columbia Pike intersection and constructing roundabouts at Good Hope Road, Thompson Road, and Peach Orchard Road in Spencerville. MDSHA has also {{conducted a study}} concerning MD 198 between the Baltimore–Washington Parkway and Fort Meade. Proposed <b>improvements</b> <b>are</b> associated with the Base Realignment and Closure process that has greatly increased activity at Fort Meade. The preferred alternative {{that came out of the}} study was to expand MD 198 from the Baltimore–Washington Parkway to MD 32 to a four-lane divided highway and to construct a flyover ramp from westbound MD 32 to westbound MD 198 to supplement the existing dumbbell interchange.|$|E

5|$|Only {{recently}} have attempts to improve {{health in the}} developing world concentrated on not only physical illness but also mental health. Deliberate self-harm is common {{in the developing world}}. Research into self-harm in the developing world is however still very limited although an important case study is that of Sri Lanka, which is a country exhibiting a high incidence of suicide and self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons. Many people admitted for deliberate self-poisoning during a study by Eddleston et al. were young and few expressed a desire to die, but death was relatively common in the young in these cases. The improvement of medical management of acute poisoning in the developing world is poor and <b>improvements</b> <b>are</b> required in order to reduce mortality.|$|E
