5|$|The nerve {{dysfunction}} in Guillain–Barré {{syndrome is}} caused by an <b>immune</b> <b>attack</b> on the nerve cells of the peripheral nervous system and their support structures. The nerve cells have their body (the soma) in the spinal cord and a long projection (the axon) that carries electrical nerve impulses to the neuromuscular junction where the impulse is transferred to the muscle. Axons are wrapped in a sheath of Schwann cells that contain myelin. Between Schwann cells are gaps (nodes of Ranvier) where the axon is exposed. Different types of Guillain–Barré syndrome feature different types of <b>immune</b> <b>attack.</b> The demyelinating variant (AIDP, see below) features damage to the myelin sheath by white blood cells (T lymphocytes and macrophages); this process is preceded by activation {{of a group of}} blood proteins known as complement. In contrast, the axonal variant is mediated by IgG antibodies and complement against the cell membrane covering the axon without direct lymphocyte involvement.|$|E
25|$|New {{infectious}} progeny virus are {{assembled in}} the cell nucleus. Papillomaviruses have evolved a mechanism for releasing virions into the environment. Other kinds of non-enveloped animal viruses utilize an active lytic process to kill the host cell, allowing release of progeny virus particles. Often this lytic process is associated with inflammation, which might trigger <b>immune</b> <b>attack</b> against the virus. Papillomaviruses exploit desquamation as a stealthy, non-inflammatory release mechanism.|$|E

2500|$|One {{group of}} {{researchers}} applied {{the field of}} neuroproteomics to examine how different proteins affect the initial growth of neuritis. [...] The experiment compared the protein activity of control neurons with the activity of neurons treated with nerve growth factor (NGF) and JNJ460, an “immunophilin ligand.” [...] JNJ460 is an offspring of another drug {{that is used to}} prevent <b>immune</b> <b>attack</b> when organs are transplanted. [...] It is not an immunosuppressant, however, but rather it acts as a shield against microglia. [...] NGF promotes neuron viability and differentiation by binding to TrkA, a tyrosine receptor kinase. [...] This receptor is important in initiating intracellular metabolic pathways, including Ras, Rak, and MAP kinase.|$|E

40|$|Autoimmune {{diseases}} {{are characterized by}} the body's ability to mount <b>immune</b> <b>attacks</b> on self. This results from recognition of self-proteins and leads to organ damage due to increased production of pathogenic inflammatory molecules and autoantibodies.

40|$|Regulation of {{immune system}} is of {{paramount}} importance to prevent <b>immune</b> <b>attacks</b> against self-components. Mice deficient in the interleukin (IL) - 2 /IL- 15 receptor � chain, CD 122, are model animals of such <b>immune</b> <b>attacks</b> and characteristically have a high number of abnormally activated T cells. Here, we show that the transfer of CD 8 �CD 122 � cells into CD 122 -deficient neonates totally prevented the development of abnormal T cells. Furthermore, recombination activating gene– 2 �� � mice that received wild-type mice–derived CD 8 �CD 122 � cells died within 10 wk after cell transfer, indicating that normal CD 8 �CD 122 � cells become dangerously activated T cells in the absence of CD 8 �CD 122 � T cells. CD 8 �CD 122 � cells could control activated CD 8 � or CD 4 � T cells both in vivo and in vitro. Our results indicate that the CD 8 �CD 122 � population includes naturally occurring CD 8 � regulatory T cells that control potentially dangerous T cells.

40|$|Using gene {{microarray}} technology, {{we found}} that inflammation in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) not only induced the expression of many immune-related genes, but also significantly altered the gene expression profile of neural cells. Two unique groups of CNS genes were identified. The first group includes genes encoding ion channels, neural transmitters and growth factors. The second group includes genes that are important for nervous tissue regeneration. Additionally, a distinct pattern of gene expression was also identified in recovering animals. Thus, during autoimmune inflammation, the CNS actively responds to <b>immune</b> <b>attacks</b> by activating its own defense and repair genes...|$|R
