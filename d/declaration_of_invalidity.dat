25|$|In 2006, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, then Peter MacKay, again denied Khadr's application, {{this time}} invoking section 10.1 of the amended Canadian Passport Order. Section 10.1 was later {{challenged}} in Federal Court by Fateh Kamel, whose passport {{had also been}} refused for national security reasons. On March 13, 2008, the Federal Court declared section 10.1 of the Canadian Passport Order to be unconstitutional and therefore invalid, though the court suspended its <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> for six months {{in order to allow}} the government time to amend the order. The federal government launched an appeal at the Federal Court of Appeal and a ruling handed down on January 29, 2009 overturned the lower court decision. The court unanimously agreed the denial of passport service on national grounds is in compliance with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, citing the limitation clause (Section 1) as its main decision point. Kamel launched an appeal in 2009 to the Supreme Court of Canada but the court declined to hear his case and thus ended the legality challenge to the Canadian Passport Order.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the powers}} of law {{enforcement}} officers to conduct covert surveillance had been largely unchecked before 2005. The legal basis for covert surveillance first came under scrutiny in two criminal cases in the District Court in 2005. To plug the loophole, the Chief Executive promulgated the Law Enforcement (Covert Surveillance Procedure) Order in August 2005. Leung Kwok-hung and Koo Sze Yiu, two political activists who claimed they had probably been targets of covert surveillance, brought an action to challenge {{the constitutionality of the}} practice of covert surveillance. They succeeded at the Court of First Instance, which held that section 33 of the Telecommunication Ordinance and the Order were both unconstitutional. The former created the power to intercept communications without adequate safeguards against abuse. The later failed to comply with the procedural requirement in the Basic Law. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal. The Court of Final Appeal suspended for six months the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> of the unconstitutional provisions, so that new legislation can be introduced to regulate covert surveillance. The Interception of Communications and Surveillance Ordinance (Cap. 589) was passed by the Legislative Council on 6 August 2006 after a 58-hour debate.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was some}} {{disagreement}} about the remedy: the majority (eight of the justices) {{ruled that the}} <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> should be suspended for a year to allow Parliament to correct the situation, as there were {{different ways in which}} this could be done, and the Law Reform Commission had already investigated several proposals. If Parliament did not end the inequality by 1 December 2006, then words would automatically be [...] "read in" [...] to the Marriage Act to allow same-sex marriages. Justice Kate O'Regan dissented, arguing that these words should be read in immediately.|$|E

40|$|Under the {{traditional}} “Blackstonian” approach, a section 52 (1) <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> constitutional <b>invalidity</b> is {{deemed to be}} fully retroactive based on the the ory that a government does not have authority to enact an unconstitutional law. Without abandoning this traditional approach, the Supreme Court of Canada has held that a fully retroactive declaration {{is not always a}} practical solution and for this reason, among others, has strayed from {{the traditional}} approach and limited the retroactive nature <b>of</b> <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> in many cases. This paper examines {{the ways in which the}} Supreme Court has limited the fully retroactive nature <b>of</b> <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity,</b> namely (i) temporary suspensions; (ii) prospective overrulings accompanied by transition periods; (iii) the doctrine of qualified immunity; (iv) the general rule limiting individual remedies in combination with a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> invalidity; and (v) res judicata and the de facto doctrine. It the n proceeds to analyze the Court’s decision in Hislop v. Canada, in which the Court attempts to reconcile its previous rulings on the retroactive nature <b>of</b> <b>declarations</b> with the traditional the oretical approach. Finally, this paper critically analyzes the new test developed in Hislop to determine whether a section 52 declaration has retroactive effect...|$|R
2500|$|An {{administrative}} tribunal may {{qualify as a}} {{court of competent jurisdiction}} where it has been granted statutory jurisdiction over the parties, subject matter, and remedy sought. It {{is important to note that}} the jurisdiction over [...] "remedy sought" [...] means the jurisdiction as granted by statute, irrespective of the total remedies available under section 24(1) that may be applied by other courts. Even where a tribunal is not found to be a court of competent jurisdiction it is still nonetheless capable of applying the Charter. Where a tribunal has been given the power to decide questions of law it must conform to the Constitution in all of its application of law and so invalid laws must be treated as having no force or effect. However, even if the tribunal is a court of competent jurisdiction it cannot make a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> for any invalid law, it can only treat it as no force or effect.|$|E

5000|$|The next {{question}} to be considered was {{whether or not the}} <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity,</b> referred to the Constitutional Court in terms of section 172(2)(a), should be confirmed. In deciding whether to develop the definition of rape, noted Nkabinde J, the Court was obliged to confine itself to the facts of the case: [...] "It follows therefore that the Court cannot confirm the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> {{to the extent that it}} is based on conclusions relating to the gender-neutral nature of the crime, an issue that does not arise on the facts of this case." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{court held}} that the {{application}} was in substance an application for direct access. The court had stressed {{on more than one occasion}} that applications for direct access should be granted only in exceptional circumstances. In effect the Minister was asking for an order to suspend the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity.</b> This is an order that should be made, as the Constitution contemplates in section 172(1)(b), by the court making the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity.</b> In this case, the order could have been made by the SCA. It was best placed to determine what was just and equitable in the circumstances.|$|E

However, on June 10, 2003, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled on an appeal in the Halpern case. The Court agreed with the lower court that the traditional definition of marriage was discriminatory and that same-sex marriage was legally permitted. However, unlike the previous three court decisions, the Court of Appeal did not suspend its decision to allow Parliament to consider the issue. Instead, it ruled that the 2001 marriages were legal and same-sex marriage was available throughout Ontario immediately: Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)., [...] O.J. No. 2268, [...] (Ont.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this paper {{outlines}} three different approaches to the exercise of remedial discretion under the Charter, namely the exercise of strong discretion, rule-based discretion and principled discretion. The Supreme Court’s decision in Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia is next examined {{as an example of how}} remedial discretion can be guided by general principles such as the need for an effective remedy and respect for institutional roles. The Court’s advance costs decision in British Columbia v. Okanagan Indian Band is examined from the perspective of all three models of discretion with an emphasis on the dangers of strong discretion that is not guided by law. Finally, decisions on suspended <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity,</b> in particular Schachter v. Canada, are examined with an emphasis on the dangers of rule-based discretion that reduces remedial discretion to self-executing categories...|$|R

The Supreme Court issued a 12-month suspended <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{church does}} not {{recognise}} divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state-recognised divorce {{only as a}} means of protecting the property and well being of the spouses and any children. However, consideration of particular cases by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal can lead to <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>invalidity</b> <b>of</b> a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an annulment. Remarriage following a divorce is not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid.|$|R
50|$|Bastarache J for the Supreme Court, because unjust {{enrichment}} principles are ill-suited to determine constitutional issues of ultra vires taxes, {{that is the}} wrong approach. There should be a remedy as of constitutional right. When governments collect taxes ultra vires it undermines the rule of law. So {{there must be a}} right to restitution. Parliament can prevent fiscal chaos by suspending <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> and enacting valid taxes and applying them retroactively. The passing on defence is inconsistent with restitution law, it confuses compensation matters, and is not concerned with the possibility that the claimant may receive a windfall. It is economically misconceived and creates difficulties of proof. There is no need to consider the counter arguments to passing on, of protest and compulsion. The six year limitation in the New Brunswick Limitation of Actions Act s 9 applied. There was no right to compound interest, which might be warranted to express a moral sanction.|$|R
5000|$|Canon law {{presumes that}} all marriages are valid until proven otherwise. Annulment {{respondents}} {{who want to}} use canon law to defend their marriage against <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> {{have the right to}} have a competent advocate assisting them. An advocate is like a lawyer. Respondents have the right to read the petition (called libellus, meaning [...] "little book") of the petitioner. The petition must describe, in a general way, the facts and proofs that the petitioner is using as the basis for alleging that parties' marriage is invalid. It is necessary that tribunal judges study the jurisprudence of the Roman Rota, since the rota is responsible to promote the unity of jurisprudence and, through its own sentences, to be of assistance to lower tribunals (Dignitas Connubii, art. 35, citing Pastor bonus, art.126). Annulment respondents can use case law from the Roman Rota to support their defense of marriage. Roman Rota decisions are available at Msgr. Cormac Burke's website.|$|R
50|$|R. v. Parker was the {{landmark}} decision that first invalidated the cannabis prohibition. However the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> {{was suspended for}} one year.

The Court found that the prohibition on cannabis was unconstitutional as it did not contain any exemption for medical use.|$|E

40|$|The author argues that, {{since the}} early 1980 s, the Supreme Court of Canada has {{followed}} the path of judicial restraint when adjudicating federalism disputes {{to a degree that}} is unprecedented in the Court 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 s history. The Court has almost entirely abandoned, for more than two decades, the use <b>of</b> <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> to police the federal division of legislative powers. Over the same period, however, the Court has demonstrated an increased willingness to invoke the interjurisdictional immunity doctrine and the paramountcy doctrine to limit the application and operation of provincial statutes. The combined effect of these trends has been to increase the legal potential for federal dominance and provincial subordination. The jurisprudence makes the exercise of provincial legislative autonomy increasingly conditional upon securing federal consent or forbearance. So long as the provincial pursuit of distinct policies in the growing areas of shared jurisdiction is conditional upon a permissive federal posture, the provinces cannot be confident that their autonomy will be safeguarded in the future...|$|R
50|$|The Constitutional Court {{held that}} the purpose of section 172(2)(a) was to ensure that the Constitutional Court, as the highest court in {{constitutional}} matters, controls <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> constitutional <b>invalidity</b> made against the highest organs of state. This purpose would be defeated, the court found, if the issue in casu, concerning the legality of the President's conduct (a matter of considerable importance), were characterised as not falling within section 172(2)(a); that would be to remove it from the controlling power of the Constitutional Court. The section was, therefore, to be given a wide meaning as far as the President's conduct was concerned.|$|R
5000|$|The nine judges {{hearing the}} case agreed {{unanimously}} that same-sex couples {{were entitled to}} marry, accordingly declared the common-law definition of marriage to be inconsistent with the Constitution and invalid {{to the extent that}} it did not permit same-sex couples to enjoy the status and the benefits coupled with responsibilities it accorded to heterosexual couples. They disagreed as to the remedy. The majority suspended the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> for a period of a year to allow Parliament time to correct the defect. It also declared the omission from section 30(1) of the Marriage Act after the words [...] "or husband" [...] of the words [...] "or spouse" [...] to be inconsistent with the Constitution, and invalid to the extent of the inconsistency. Again, the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> was suspended for a year to allow Parliament time to correct the defect. Justice Kate O'Regan, the lone dissenter in part, thought the statute should be altered immediately.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the alleged}} {{uncertainty}} created by the High Court's <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity,</b> the Road Accident Fund (the third respondent) sought {{direct access to the}} CC for an order declaring Proclamation R32 of 2006, issued by the President in substitution for the first proclamation, before 31 July 2006, to have brought lawfully into operation sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Amendment Act with effect from 31 July 2006.|$|E
50|$|Section 172(1)(b) of the Constitution conferred a {{discretion}} on the Constitutional Court to {{make any}} order that is just and equitable. Having found that the common-law definition of rape was not constitutionally invalid, but merely falls short of the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights, the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity</b> {{of the definition of}} rape was therefore set aside, to be replaced with an appropriate order.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between interpreting legislation in a way which “promotes the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights” as required by s 39(2) of the Constitution and the process of reading words into or severing them from a statutory provision which is a remedial measure under s 172(1)(b), following upon a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> constitutional <b>invalidity</b> under s 172(1)(a) .... The first process, being an interpretative one, is limited to what the text is reasonably capable of meaning. The latter can only take place after the statutory provision in question, notwithstanding the application of all legitimate interpretative aids, is found to be constitutionally invalid.|$|R
40|$|The {{jurisprudence}} of the Supreme Court of Canada on {{the constitutionality}} of mandatory minimum sentences, from R. v. Smith to R. v. Latimer, is reviewed and assessed in light of relevant developments in constitutional law and sentencing. These include the Supreme Courts increasing interest in constitutional minimalism and corresponding reluctance to rely on hypothetical offenders and facial <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>invalidity.</b> The {{manner in which the}} Court 2 ̆ 7 s increasing concern for crime victims and fault levels has been used to justify upholding mandatory sentences is examined. The author also relates this jurisprudence to trends in sentencing, including an increasing acceptance of mandatory sentences as deserved punishment relative to the fault of offenders. Also explored is the possibility that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision to uphold mandatory penalties as not being grossly disproportionate may require a ratcheting up of the sentencing tariff to maintain ordinal proportionality. The impact of enacting mandatory minimum sentences on the Court 2 ̆ 7 s dichotomy between the punitive and restorative purposes of sentencing is also addressed. Finally, the author concludes that the Supreme Court has abandoned many of the premises of Smith giving Parliament the dominant role in deciding whether to enact mandatory minimum sentences. The author argues that a return to the activism of Smith would produce a strong judicial voice in favour of individualized punishment utile not providing the final word in dialogues between the Court and Parliament on the subject of punishment...|$|R
