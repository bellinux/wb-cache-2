5|$|As {{the show}} progressed through tryouts, Hammerstein {{repeatedly}} revised it, obscuring Suzy's profession {{and the nature}} of Fauna's <b>house.</b> <b>Pipe</b> Dream met with poor reviews, and rapidly closed once it exhausted its advance sale. It had no national tour or London production, and has rarely been presented since. No movie version of the show was made; the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization (which licenses their works) once hoped for a film version featuring the Muppets with Fauna played by Miss Piggy.|$|R

25|$|The Fukushima Daiichi NPS {{has several}} {{seawater}} piping trenches which were {{originally designed to}} <b>house</b> <b>pipes</b> and cables running from the Unit 24 turbine buildings to their seaside, which doesn't directly connect to the sea. Inside the trench, radioactive contaminated water has been accumulating since the accident. Due {{to the risk of}} soil or ocean contamination from these trenches, TEPCO has been trying to remove the accumulated water in the trenches by pumping it back into the turbine buildings, as well as backfilling the trenches to reduce or prevent further incursion of contaminated water.|$|R
50|$|Pipes {{announced}} that he would run as a Republican against Democratic State Representative James R. Domengeaux of Lafayette for a seat in the U.S. <b>House.</b> <b>Pipes</b> had scant chance of victory, but he was making a political statement for the long-term future of Louisiana politics. Pipes became a Republican about the time that Charles deGravelles and his wife, the former Virginia Wheadon, had become the first whites in decades to register with the GOP in Lafayette Parish. The deGravelleses would later serve as party chairman and national committeewoman, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea for}} SmartThings was {{conceived}} by co-founder and CEO Alex Hawkinson {{in the winter}} of 2011 when his family's mountain house in Colorado was extensively damaged after a power outage caused the <b>house's</b> <b>pipes</b> to freeze and burst. When power was restored, water flowed through the unoccupied house causing approximately $80,000 in damages. Hawkinson noted that he could have prevented the damages if he had known what was happening inside the house. After failing to find a suitable solution to the problem, Hawkinson and co-founders began to build a SmartThings working prototype.|$|R

50|$|The current {{layout of}} the organ was Emerson Richards' third design. The first design was to <b>house</b> 43,000 <b>pipes</b> in six {{chambers}} (all mentioned above without the two Forward chambers), but the quoted cost greatly exceeded the allocated $300,000, and there wasn't enough space to <b>house</b> all the <b>pipes.</b> The numbers of pipes was then reduced to 29,000. Later, when the Forward Chambers were also used, some stops from the original plan were reinstated, raising the numbers of pipes to the present official number of 33,114 (see also below). The contract price was $347,200.|$|R
50|$|As {{the station}} {{had to be}} built into the {{existing}} tunnel path, it was deemed too expensive and impractical to alter {{the path of the}} tunnels. This resulted in the track construction continuing as planned, while a station pit was built around them. As a result, Vyrlytsia opened half a year after Boryspilska. The curvature of the platform is a merit to this. The other visible sign is the central pillar span that separates the paths. Like {{in the rest of the}} stretch this was to <b>house</b> <b>pipes</b> and tubes with communication cables, again for reasons of cost-saving, these were left and instead coated with metallic planes, which were also used for the ceiling of the station.|$|R

5000|$|The CAP project brought {{river water}} to Tucson successfully, but the initial {{implementation}} was a [...] "debacle." [...] The river water {{had a different}} mineral mixture and flow pattern from the aquifer water, stirring up and dislodging rust in city water mains and <b>house</b> <b>pipes.</b> By the end of 1993, the city of Tucson paid about $145,000 to install filters in 925 homes, lost about $200,000 in revenues by adjusting water bills, and paid about $450,000 in damages claimed by homeowners for ruined pipes, water heaters, and other appliances. The city returned some houses to ground water, but problems remained. Zinc orthophosphate was added to coat the pipes and prevent the rust from dislodging, but the return to groundwater removed the zinc orthophosphate. The solution was an EPA-funded 'blended' water system, including automatically monitoring water quality throughout the city, and a website to report the water quality to the public without intervention by the City Water Department.|$|R
5000|$|Villa Aurora {{was part}} of a {{building}} project initiated by Arthur Weber and George Ley in cooperation with the Los Angeles Times, which reported routinely on the construction of this [...] "demonstration house". Weber hired architect Mark Daniels and interior designer Rodney Benso. The <b>house</b> <b>pipe</b> organ was built by Santa Monica Artcraft. Villa Aurora was inspired by the Teruel Cathedral outside Sevilla, Spain. The wood for the ceilings was brought in from Spain and the fountains came from Italy. The Malibu Tile Company supplied the decorative tiles throughout the entire house. When Villa Aurora was finished in 1928, it featured the latest technological inventions and novelties in domestic design such as an electric garage openers, a dishwasher, a fridge and a gas range. Due to the depression, it was not sold, and the developer Weber and his family were forced to move in themselves in 1931. Financial problems forced Weber to leave the house in 1939 and the property sat idle.|$|R
