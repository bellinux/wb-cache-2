50|$|Blastomyces dermatitidis {{is one of}} {{the most}} ecologically mysterious organisms causing human and animal disease. Prediction of disease risk and {{prevention}} of disease are both made extraordinarily difficult by our very poor understanding of where and how this organism normally grows in nature. Despite decades of attempts at isolating organisms from epidemiological foci, B. dermatitidis has only been isolated from the environment 21 times. Most of these isolations have been based on the arduous isolation techniques involving the suspension of soil or other environmental materials in aqueous medium with antibacterial antibiotics, and injection of mice with these materials, followed by sacrifice of the animals when they appear ill or at the end of six weeks. The internal organs of the mice are then checked microscopically for evidence of blastomycosis. Needless to say, the cost and complexity of performing such studies is imposing, especially as the ethical clearance procedures for work involving animals become ever more involved. More direct and economical mycological techniques for environmental isolation, such as <b>dilution</b> <b>plating,</b> have never yielded positive results for Blastomyces growth. Since B. dermatitidis will grow readily from clinical samples on common laboratory media, the lack of success in isolating it from environmental materials is generally ascribed to the inhibitory effects of co-occurring common molds and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.|$|E

In this study, we assessed the ability of serial <b>dilution</b> <b>plating</b> and leaf imprint methods to elucidate population abundance on the phyllosphere of eight plant species co-occurring in the same area in mediterranean ecosystem (northern Greece). The serial <b>dilution</b> <b>plating</b> method outweighed the leaf imprint method in determining the total epiphytic bacterial population and the estimates were significantly higher. However, the ability to detect presence of bacterial colony on leaf surface is higher for the leaf imprints, suggesting specific use of this method for practical purposes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increased}} temperature on Staphylococcus aureus during the inoculation {{step of the}} agar <b>dilution</b> <b>plate</b> count method was investigated as a possible cause of artificially high persister counts. For some isolates, exposure of the inoculum to increased temperature resulted in higher persister counts and diminution or loss of the paradoxical effect. The persister patterns for three representative S. aureus isolates are presented to illustrate the strain- and temperature-dependent nature of the phenomenon.

The effect of farming history on microbial soil properties was assessed by analysing soil samples from two organic and conventionally managed sites. Cmic and Nmic, enzyme activities, bacterial community composition (PCR-DGGE) and total numbers of fungi and bacteria (soil <b>dilution</b> <b>plating)</b> were determined. Results suggested that organic farming practices {{did not have a}} clear positive effect on soil microbial biomass and activity; distinct differences in bacterial community composition were detected by PCR-DGGE but not by soil <b>dilution</b> <b>plating.</b> Findings indicate that practices commonly associated with conventional farming (application of mineral fertilisers or pesticides) have a less pronounced effect on the soil microbial community than other management techniques (e. g. manure application and crop rotation) ...|$|E

40|$|Interactions between Serratia plymuthica A 30 and a blackleg-causing biovar 3 Dickeya sp. were examined. In {{a potato}} slice assay, S. plymuthica A 30 {{inhibited}} tissue maceration caused by Dickeya sp. IPO 2222 when co-inoculated at a density at least 10 {{times greater than}} that of the pathogen. In glasshouse experiments, population dynamics of the antagonist and of the pathogen in planta were studied by <b>dilution</b> <b>plating</b> and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) using fluorescent protein-tagged strains. Pathogen-free minitubers were vacuum-infiltrated with DsRed-tagged Dickeya sp. IPO 2222 and superficially treated during planting with a water suspension containing GFP-tagged S. plymuthica A 30. A 30 reduced the blackleg incidence from 55 % to 0 %. Both the pathogen and the antagonist colonized the seed potato tubers internally within 1 day post-inoculation (dpi). Between 1 and 7 dpi, the population of A 30 in tubers increased from 101 to c. 103 CFU g- 1 and subsequently remained stable {{until the end of the}} experiment (28 dpi). Populations of A 30 in stems and roots increased from c. 102 to c. 104 CFU g- 1 between 7 and 28 dpi. <b>Dilution</b> <b>plating</b> and CLSM studies showed that A 30 decreased the density of Dickeya sp. populations in plants. <b>Dilution</b> <b>plating</b> combined with microscopy allowed the enumeration of strain A 30 and its visualization in the vascular tissues of stem and roots and in the pith of roots, as well as its adherence to and colonization of the root surface.

40|$|A DNA array {{containing}} 172 oligonucleotides complementary {{to specific}} diagnostic regions of internal transcribed spacers (ITS) {{of more than}} 100 species was developed for identification and detection of Pythium species. All of the species studied, {{with the exception of}} Pythium ostracodes, exhibited a positive hybridization reaction with at least one corresponding species-specific oligonucleotide. Hybridization patterns were distinct for each species. The array hybridization patterns included cluster-specific oligonucleotides that facilitated the recognition of species, including new ones, belonging to groups such as those producing filamentous or globose sporangia. BLAST analyses against 500 publicly available Pythium sequences in GenBank confirmed that species-specific oligonucleotides were unique to all of the available strains of each species, of which there were numerous economically important ones. GenBank entries of newly described species that are not putative synonyms showed no homology to sequences of the spotted species-specific oligonucleotides, but most new species did match some of the cluster-specific oligonucleotides. Further verification of the specificity of the DNA array was done with 50 additional Pythium isolates obtained by soil <b>dilution</b> <b>plating.</b> The hybridization patterns obtained were consistent with the identification of these isolates based on morphology and ITS sequence analyses. In another blind test, total DNA of the same soil samples was amplified and hybridized on the array, and the results were compared to those of 130 Pythium isolates obtained by soil <b>dilution</b> <b>plating</b> and root baiting. The 13 species detected by the DNA array corresponded to the isolates obtained by a combination of soil <b>dilution</b> <b>plating</b> and baiting, except for one new species that was not represented on the array. We conclude that the reported DNA array is a reliable tool for identification and detection of the majority of Pythium species in environmental samples. Simultaneous detection and identification of multiple species of soilborne pathogens such as Pythium species could be a major step forward for epidemiological and ecological studies...|$|E

Cell concentrations of Xap between 103 - 107 CFU/mL were added to healthy bean seed extracts. A flow cytometry sorting procedure was developed to separate immuno-stained Xap cells from crude seed extracts and confirming by PCR. FCM was evaluated for direct viable counting (DVC) of Xap using combinations of propidium iodide (PI) and carboxy fluorescein diacetate (cFDA) or PI and SYTO 9 and also the combination of immuno-FCM and PI. <b>Dilution</b> <b>plating</b> and IF allowed detection of Xap in bean seed extracts {{in a range of}} 103 - 106 CFU/mL and immuno-FCM from 104 - 106 CFU/mL.

40|$|Clonostachys rosea strain IK 726 and Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain MA 342 are two {{promising}} biocontrol microbes {{which both}} has various biocontrol mechanisms to control many seed and soil-borne plant diseases. Because a potential additive effect may exist {{between these two}} biocontrol microbes, like an expanded antagonistic spectrum and enhanced persistence of biocontrol effect, we expected to get a more competitive biocontrol {{with a mixture of}} IK 726 and MA 342. Strong colonization and high persistence ability on seed and root is one important trait of a potential biocontrol agent. This study was aimed to estimate the colonization ability on seed and root under the circumstances of joint and alone applications of IK 726 and MA 342 as seed-dressing on spring wheat cultivar Dacke. By comparing the <b>dilution</b> <b>plating</b> results of joint and alone inoculated treatments, we observed that IK 726 slightly reduced the initial seed inoculum of MA 342.

40|$|Fusarium {{species are}} among most common fungal {{pathogens}} of maize, causing root rot, stalk rot, stalk lodging and ear rot. Fusarium verticillioides and F. graminearum {{are two of}} the most prevalent stalk rot fungi in Nebraska and Iowa. Corn root worms (CRW) are the most costly pests of maize plants, causing damage to both above- and below-ground parts of the plant. CRW feeding on roots creates good invading sites for different fungal species. The goal of this research was to determine whether use of transgenic CRW-resistant maize hybrids will have reduced levels of Fusarium colonization of roots and stalks compared to their near-isogenic susceptible hybrids. Experiments were conducted at two locations each in 2007 and 2008 in fields with high populations of Western corn root worms, (Diabrotica virgifera LeConte) : Bruner farm near Ames, IA (2007), ISU Southeast Research Farm near Crawfordsville, IA (2007 - 2008), and Agricultural Research and Development Center, Univ. of NE near Mead, Nebraska (2007 - 2008). Commercially available hybrids with CRW-resistance transgenes along with their near-isogenic CRW-susceptible hybrids were planted. The CRW events include DAS- 59122 (Herculexy Xtra), MON 863 (Yieldgard Plusy), MON 88107 (Yieldgard VT Tripley) and MIR 604 (Agrisurey RW/CB/LL). In 2008, insecticidal seed treatment also was tested for its effect on CRW feeding and subsequent Fusarium colonization. Sampling was done on roots in mid-July and stalks in mid-September in 2007 and in 2008 mid-September roots were also sampled. Root colonization was assessed by <b>dilution</b> <b>plating</b> of dried ground tissue, and by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). v Primers and fluorogenic probes, specific to mycotoxin biosynthesis genes in F. verticillioides and F. graminearum were used to quantify root and stalk colonization. Standard calibration curves of both species showed linear correlation (r 2 = 0. 99) between the fungal genomic DNA and the threshold cycle values. There were highly significant differences in colonization between resistant and near isogenic susceptible hybrids for events MON 88017 and MIR 604 in Nebraska July roots in 2007. F. verticillioides was at high levels in Nebraska whereas F. graminearum was more common in Iowa. Stalks from both locations were highly colonized with F. graminearum. The PCR results were compared to a microbiological <b>dilution</b> <b>plating</b> method. In 2007 the results of the two methods correlated well but in 2008 they did not follow the same pattern. In <b>dilution</b> <b>plating</b> results we could consistently see significantly lower Fusarium CFU/g tissue in hybrids with CRW resistance than in near-isogenic CRW susceptible hybrids. Insecticidal seed treatment did not {{have a significant effect on}} level of colonization of fungal species measured by PCR or <b>dilution</b> <b>plating</b> results. CRW feeding on maize roots sometimes enhanced the infection of roots by Fusarium species and transgenic CRW resistant hybrids suffered less colonization than susceptible hybrids in CRW infested fields. However, the interaction between Fusarium spp and CRW varied in their degree among Fusarium species. Known maize pathogens F. verticillioides and F. graminearum were not consistently affected by CRW resistance as much as the total Fusarium population. The impact of this interaction on stalk rots is not clearly demonstrated...|$|E

The culturable endophytic bacterial communities detected in potato stem bases as well as in roots were in most cases on the order 103 to 105 CFU g? 1 of fresh plant tissue. <b>Dilution</b> <b>plating</b> revealed that a range of bacterial types dominated these populations. Dominant isolates fell into the a and g subgroups of the Proteobacteria, {{as well as in the}} Flavobacterium/Cytophaga group. Different representatives of the Firmicutes were also found. The most frequently isolated strains (> 5 % of the total) were characterized as different Pseudomonas spp. (including P. aureofaciens, P. corrugata, and P. putida), Agrobacterium radiobacter, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Flavobacterium resinovorans, using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis and/or sequencing of their partial 16 S ribosomal RNA genes. Other Proteobacteria or Firmicutes were also found, albeit infrequently, and mainly in potato stem tissue. The fate of three putative potato endophytes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacillus sp., and Sphingomonas paucimobilis, was monitored following their release into potato plants via injection, via root dipping, or via the soil. Following stem injection, the S. maltophilia and Bacillus inoculants could be tracked over time periods of, respectively, 22 and 1 day(s) by <b>dilution</b> <b>plating</b> as well as via PCR-DGGE. However, only S. maltophilia was able to colonize, and persist in, plant tissue from soil or dipped roots. S. paucimobilis was never recovered from the plant irrespective of the mode of introduction. The {{diversity of}} the indigenous bacterial flora associated with potato was then monitored via PCR-DGGE. The patterns obtained revealed the existence of bacterial communities of limited complexity, with communities from potato stems typically differing from those from stem peel and roots. Evidence was obtained for the endophytic occurrence of a range of organisms falling into the a, b, and g subgroups of the Proteobacteria as well as in the Firmicutes.
