5|$|The <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> was {{developed}} to monitor the trade in rough diamonds and prevent their being used to fund violence. Before exporting, rough diamonds are certificated {{by the government of}} the country of origin. Some countries, such as Venezuela, are not party to the agreement. The <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> does not apply to local sales of rough diamonds within a country.|$|E
5|$|Players control {{one of two}} diamond trading companies: the eponymous Diamond Trust of London or {{an unnamed}} Antwerp-based competitor. The game is set in 2000 and {{the aim is to}} extract {{diamonds}} from Angola before the <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> Certification Scheme is put in place. The winner is the one who finishes the game with the most diamonds after nine turns. Each turn, players decide where to send their three agents. They can be sent to six different Angolan regions to extract diamonds, or recalled to the player's headquarters to deposit extracted diamonds. Players make decisions in secret, and both sets of decisions are resolved on the game board simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|This work investigates how the {{delimitation}} {{of rights}} of ownership influences economic and political stabilities of the country which is characterized by large mineral riches, particularly by diamonds. Theoretical {{part of the work}} is summarizing actual knowledge of several important economists in a spere of juridical delimitation of the private ownership and its subsequent protection. Precisely existence of this two elements is a condition for stability of economy, its long-term qrowth and entire welfare of society. In a practical part of the work these theoretical conclusions are applied to problems of so-called blood diamonds, existence of which was caused patricularly by absence of private ownership and its protection in quite a number of African countries. The closing part of the work is answering the query if a <b>Kimberley's</b> <b>process,</b> which tried to solve problems of blood diamonds, can from the long-term point of view represent an insurance against their prospective further revert to the world-wide markets...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Easily concealed and transported, and virtually untraceable to their original source, diamonds are often used in lieu of currency in arms deals, money laundering, and other criminal activity. U. S. controls over diamond imports only require certification from the country of last import [...] and thus cannot identify diamonds from conflict sources. Although the United States bans diamonds documented as coming from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone, and Liberia [...] {{all of which are}} subject to U. N. sanctions [...] this does not prevent such diamonds from being shipped to a second country and mixed into parcels destined for the United States. GAO found that the <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process's</b> proposal for international diamond certification incorporated some elements of accountability. However, it is not based on a risk assessment, and some high-risk activities are subject only to "recommended" controls. Also, from the time when rough diamonds enter the first foreign port until the final point of sale, there exists only a voluntary industry participation and self-regulated monitoring and enforcement system. These and other shortcomings significantly undermine efforts to deter trade in questionable diamonds. ...|$|R
25|$|The company's founder, Martin Rapaport, {{as well as}} <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> {{initiators}} Ian Smillie and Global Witness, {{are among}} several industry insiders and observers who have called for greater checks and certification programs among many other programs that would ensure protection for miners and producers in developing countries. Smillie and Global Witness have since withdrawn support for the <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process.</b> Other concerns in the diamond industry include working conditions in diamond cutting centers {{as well as the}} use of child labor. Both of these concerns come up when considering issues in Surat, India.|$|E
25|$|The {{implementation}} of the KPCS is coordinated by the State Department’s Office of Threat Finance Countermeasures in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs. A <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> Implementation Coordinating Committee was also established in 2003 to implement the act, including officials from the Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative.|$|E
25|$|The film's ending, {{in which}} a conference is held {{concerning}} blood diamonds, refers to a historic meeting {{that took place in}} Kimberley, South Africa, in 2000. It led to development of the <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> Certification Scheme, which sought to certify the origin of rough diamonds in order to curb the trade in conflict diamonds, but has since been mostly abandoned as ineffective.|$|E
25|$|The United States also lacks {{an agency}} {{in charge of}} diamond import confirmations, which allows traders to bypass the {{requirement}} of reporting the receipt of the diamond shipment within 15 days of the arrival. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the agency in charge of overseeing incoming diamond shipments and conducting examinations of shipments. There is also little oversight of the U.S. <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> Authority (USKPA), {{who are responsible for}} issuing <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> certificates, so no one supervises the company making sure that USKPA adheres to KPCS standards. The closest oversight comes from the Department of State, who “convene periodic teleconferences with the USKPA”. The CDTA also does not directly deal with the retail diamond sector, as the Act only applies to rough diamonds as opposed to cut and polished diamonds. While some retailers take strong initiatives to avoid conflict diamonds, many do not, so the effectiveness of the Act to completely eliminate the trade of conflict diamonds is often questioned. It has also been suggested that other countries have similarly struggled with the implementation of the KPCS.|$|E
25|$|While {{official}} commodity exports declined {{during the}} 1990s as many investors fled the civil war, Liberia's wartime economy featured {{the exploitation of}} the region's diamond wealth. The country acted as a major trader in Sierra Leonian blood diamonds, exporting over US$300 million in diamonds in 1999. This led to a United Nations ban on Liberian diamond exports in 2001, which was lifted in 2007 following Liberia's accession to the <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> Certification Scheme.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to public concerns that their diamond purchases were contributing {{to war and}} human rights abuses in central and western Africa, the United Nations, the diamond industry and diamond-trading nations introduced the <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> in 2002. The <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> aims to ensure that conflict diamonds do not become intermixed with the diamonds not controlled by such rebel groups. This is done by requiring diamond-producing countries to provide proof that the money they make from selling the diamonds is not used to fund criminal or revolutionary activities. Although the <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> has been moderately successful in {{limiting the number of}} conflict diamonds entering the market, some still find their way in. According to the International Diamond Manufacturers Association, conflict diamonds constitute 2–3% of all diamonds traded. Two major flaws still hinder the effectiveness of the Kimberley Process: (1) the relative ease of smuggling diamonds across African borders, and (2) the violent nature of diamond mining in nations that are not in a technical state of war and whose diamonds are therefore considered [...] "clean".|$|E

2500|$|On 28 November 2000, in Gaborone, Botswana, negotiators {{for dozens}} of diamond {{exporting}} and importing countries ended over a year of negotiations and agreed on the elements of an international certification program, which would become the <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> Certification Scheme, adopted by the UN at their 79th plenary meeting on 1 December. The Washington Times wrote, [...] "If the White House fails to immediately shore up the legislation, blood diamonds will symbolize Mr. Clinton's stained legacy in Africa"; especially because, as [...] "the world's largest diamond jewelry market", the United States had more of a responsibility to take initiative in supporting the KPCS and in the CDTA legislation.

[...] The U.S. government, which had never recognized the legitimacy of the MPLA, finally recognized the Angolan government, further alienating Savimbi. [...] After failed talks in 1993 to end the conflict, another agreement, the Lusaka Protocol, was implemented in 1994 to form a government of national unity. [...] In 1995, U.N. peacekeepers arrived. [...] But Unita broke away from the Lusaka agreement in 1998, citing violations of it by the MPLA. [...] In late 1998, a militant group calling itself Unita Renovada broke away from mainstream Unita, when several Unita commanders dissatisfied with the leadership of Jonas Savimbi ended their allegiance to his organization.

5000|$|The New York Times {{reported}} on Monday, 5 December 2011 that Global Witness had {{withdrawn from the}} <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> coalition, saying that it felt the effort no longer effectively ensured that conflict diamonds did not make their way onto retail markets. The organization is the first advocacy group to leave the program. While the organization had expressed concerns over {{the operation of the}} <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> for some time, the final straw leading to its withdrawal was the decision to allow Zimbabwe to export diamonds from the Marange fields, where there have been reports of widespread human rights abuses by government security forces. “It’s the most egregious situation that we’ve seen since the <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> was launched, where diamonds have been fueling violence and human rights violations, and the Kimberley has really failed to deal with that effectively,” said Annie Dunnebacke, the senior campaigner for Global Witness. The diamond industry was “hiding behind the Kimberley Process,” Ms. Dunnebacke said, adding that many traders and dealers did not perform due diligence in checking the actual source of the diamonds they were dealing. “They’ve just been saying, ‘We have the <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process</b> for diamonds, so that’s that. We’ve solved the problem of blood diamonds.’” Farai Maguwu, the director of the Zimbabwe-based Centre for Research and Development, which {{is also a member of}} the <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process,</b> said he believed Global Witness’s withdrawal was not enough to bring down the entire <b>Kimberley</b> <b>Process.</b> But, he said, “it’s a very big blow.
