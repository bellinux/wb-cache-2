5|$|On October 15, 1966, the <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> Act {{created the}} National Register of Historic Places and the {{corresponding}} State <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> Offices (SHPO). Initially, the National Register consisted of the National Historic Landmarks designated before the Register's creation, {{as well as any}} other historic sites in the National Park system. Approval of the act, which was amended in 1980 and 1992, represented the first time the United States had a broad-based <b>historic</b> <b>preservation</b> policy. The 1966 act required those agencies to work in conjunction with the SHPO and an independent federal agency, the Advisory Council on <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> (ACHP), to confront adverse effects of federal activities on <b>historic</b> <b>preservation.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1977, the church, rectory, {{and schools}} were {{recorded}} by a <b>historic</b> <b>preservation</b> program {{run by the}} Ohio Historical Society, known as the Ohio Historic Inventory. This survey found the church in excellent condition, the elementary school in fair condition, and {{the high school and}} rectory in good condition. Although no <b>historic</b> <b>preservation</b> program was in effect, no threats to historic integrity were identified for any of the buildings, except for the elementary school, which was deemed to be in danger from being outdated.|$|E

5|$|The 1966 National <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> Act, {{which created}} the National Register of Historic Places, {{empowered}} individual states to create review boards to function {{with the state}} historical preservation officer. Illinois did not create its <b>historic</b> <b>preservation</b> program until the early 1970s, {{under the direction of}} the Illinois Department of Conservation. The Department of Conservation dispatched field surveyors to all Illinois counties to find anything that might qualify for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Urban renewal {{programs}} are funded {{in part by}} federal grants. The National <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> Act of 1966, which created the NRHP, requires that federal agencies give consideration to the opinions of the Advisory Council on <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> in assessing the impact their actions will have on listed properties and consider alternatives to any action that would destroy or significantly affect them. The listings of downtown Troy's districts and buildings therefore had the practical effect of preventing their demolition for urban renewal.|$|E

5|$|Owners of income-producing {{properties}} listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or {{of properties}} that are contributing resources within a National Register Historic District may {{be eligible for}} a 20% investment tax credit for the rehabilitation of the historic structure. The rehabilitation may be of a commercial, industrial, or residential property, for rentals. The tax incentives program is operated by the Federal <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> Tax Incentives program, which is managed jointly by the National Park Service, individual State <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> Offices, and the Internal Revenue Service. Aside from the 20% tax credit, the tax incentive program offers a 10% tax credit for rehabilitation to owners of non-historic, non-residential buildings constructed before 1936.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{has been}} threatened by erosion for decades. In the 1930s, {{as a response}} to the erosion, a breakwater was constructed to protect the boat landing area. In 1996, the Connecticut Trust for <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> and the National Trust for <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> assisted the task of obtaining funding for a $4.5 million erosion-control project. The funds were approved in 1998 with the help of Connecticut Senators, Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd and New Haven's Congressional Representative Rosa DeLauro. In 2001, the construction of a stone wall and creation of a buffer zone was completed. The second phase of the project calls for protective revetment on the south side of the island.|$|E

5|$|To {{administer}} {{the newly created}} National Register of Historic Places, the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior, with director George B. Hartzog Jr., established an administrative division named the Office of Archeology and <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> (OAHP). Hartzog charged OAHP with creating the National Register program mandated by the 1966 law. Ernest Connally was the Office's first director. Within OAHP new divisions were created {{to deal with the}} National Register. The division administered several existing programs, including the Historic Sites Survey and the Historic American Buildings Survey, as well as the new National Register and <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> Fund.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} area {{residents}} initiated {{an effort to}} have the former West Michigan Pike designated {{what is now called}} a Pure Michigan Byway. The designation would prioritize the area for <b>historic</b> <b>preservation</b> grants. A Preserve America grant funded a survey from June 2007 through September 2010, the results of which were a set of reports through the Michigan State <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> Office on the historical nature of the West Michigan Pike. In 2011, the group {{was in the process of}} securing resolutions from municipalities along the highway in support of the designation. According to officials working on the byway, it can take up to seven years to complete the process. The initial proposals had the byway continuing to Mackinaw City, but as approved in 2016, it runs from New Buffalo on I-94 to Ludington, following US31 except between business loops at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehall–Montague and Pentwater.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, as part {{of urban}} renewal, the city razed about 200 {{buildings}} across 25 city blocks (roughly 40% of downtown), destroying the Gateway District and many buildings with notable architecture, including the Metropolitan Building. Efforts to save the building failed but are credited with sparking interest in (but not always succeeding in) <b>historic</b> <b>preservation</b> in the state.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, {{the tribe}} {{filed suit in}} the United States Court of Federal Claims, seeking $14,000,000 in damages for breach of trust by DOI. The tribe argued that the United States had {{exclusive}} control over the buildings and allowed them to fall into disrepair, {{a violation of the}} trust relationship established by the 1960 statute. Additionally, the tribe claimed that the Snyder Act and the National <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> Act applied in this case. The Snyder Act deals with appropriations to the BIA, and the National <b>Historic</b> <b>Preservation</b> Act discussed federal assistance for preservation programs. The United States moved for dismissal on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. In addition, the United States claimed that the statute of limitations had run under both the Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act, the acts governing claims in the Federal Court of Claims. The trial court dismissed the suit on the failure to state a claim.|$|E
