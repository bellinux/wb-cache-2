In addition, the alkalinity of wood ash was determined by titration. The ash was prepared by combustion at low (600 degrees C), middle (800 degrees C) and high temperatures (1000 degrees C). The ash composition is very important because thousands of hectares of wildlands are burned annually in Greece. The resulting deposits affect soil properties (i. e., pH) and provide a source of inorganic constituents (i. e., Ca, K, Na, Mg, etc.), while the most soluble compounds (i. e., sodium and potassium hydroxides and carbonates) do not persist through the wet season.

40|$|A {{simple method}} was {{developed}} to determine the relative particle foliar flammability and heat content of forest fuels. The apparatus used {{was similar to the}} one described by the 79 / 831 European Commission Directive for measuring the relative self-ignition temperature (minimum ambient temperature at which a certain volume of a substance ignites under defined conditions). The forest materials examined were: Cupressus sempervirens (<b>Italian</b> <b>cypress),</b> Olea europaea (Olive tree), Pinus brutia (Calabrian pine), Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine), Pistacia lentiscus (Mastic tree), Quercus coccifera (Holly oak). These species are very common in the Mediterranean region and frequently devastated by forest fires. The relative data determined (self-ignition temperature, ignition delay times, combustion duration, etc.) provide a simple screening test on the fire hazard properties of forest species, which could be used for comparison purposes. Among the forest species examined, Pinus brutia had the highest relative ignition temperature and the longest ignition delay time, while Pistacia lentiscus had the lowest and shortest ones. Also, Quercus coccifera and Pistacia lentiscus had the highest heat content and Olea europaea the lowest one.

The phloem surrounding the inoculation point exhibited de novo production of four oxygenated monoterpenes and two unidentified terpenes. The concentrations of several constitu-tive mono- and diterpenes increased strongly (especially α-thujene, sabinene, terpinolene, terpinen- 4 -ol, oxygenated monoterpenes, manool, and two unidentified diterpenes) as the infection progressed.

40|$|This study {{represents}} the first large-scale analysis using nuclear molecular markers to assess genetic diversity {{and structure of}} Cupressus sempervirens L [...] Genetic and fossil data were combined to infer the possible role of human activity and evolutionary history in shaping the diversity of cypress populations. We analysed 30 populations with six polymorphic nuclear microsatellite markers. Dramatic reductions in heterozygosity and allelic richness were observed {{from east to west}} across the species range. Structure analysis assigned individuals to two main groups separating central Mediterranean and eastern populations. The two main groups could be further divided into five subgroups which showed the following geographical distributions: Turkey with the Greek islands Rhodes and Samos, Greece (Crete), Southern Italy, Northern Italy, Tunisia with Central Italy. This pattern of genetic structure is also supported by samova and Barrier analyses. Palaeobotanical data indicated that Cupressus was present in Italy in the Pliocene, Pleistocene and Holocene. Furthermore, our molecular survey showed that <b>Italian</b> <b>cypress</b> populations experienced bottlenecks that resulted in reduced genetic diversity and allelic richness and greater genetic differentiation. Recent colonization or introduction may also have influenced levels of diversity detected in the Italian populations, as most individuals found in this range today have multilocus genotypes that are also present in the eastern range of the species. The data reveal a new interpretation of the history of cypress distribution characterized by ancient eastern populations (Turkey and Greek islands) and a mosaic of recently introduced trees and remnants of ancient, depauperate populations in the central Mediterranean range...|$|E

Effects of three levels of irrigation frequency; five levels of increasing NaCl (max 8000 ppm) in the irrigation water; and, two different soil types on the growth and survival of <b>Italian</b> <b>Cypress</b> Cupressus sempervirens, Oriental Arborvitae Thuja orientalis, and She-Oak Casuarina equisetifolia tree seedings were studied under greenhouse conditions. There were {{significant differences between the}} species throughout the stress period with regard to the evaluated parameters. Height, diameter growth, and leaf water potential in all species were reduced by increasing water and salt stress throughout the stress period. Reductions in total, shoot and root dry weight by water and salt stress were significant. Higher reductions were associated with higher water or salinity stress level. However, the species differed in their response to the stress treatments. Thuja had the lowest reductions in all measured growth parameters, followed by Casuarina and Cupressus. Water and salt stress treatments affected foliage tissue ion concentrations in all seedlings. N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, and Cl decreased as water stress level increased (except for, Na and Cl in Brazito soil). However, Ca, Mg, Na and Cl ion concentrations increased as the salinity level in the irrigation water increased. N and P decreased with increasing salinity and K was selectively accumulated. The seedlings' health declined with increasing stress treatment level. NaCl treatments caused foliar injury, which increased as the concentration of NaCl in the irrigation water increased. Thuja showed the least injury followed by Casuarina. Mortality was limited to Cupressus seedlings on both soil types. More mortality was noted with the increase in irrigation frequency and salinity level of the irrigation water. Thuja and Casuarina seedlings survived to the highest salinity level (8000 ppm NaCl), but with visible injury. Soil types affected all seedlings morphological parameters, total water potential, and foliage ion concentrations, except for P and Ca. All seedlings (except for Casuarina root dry weight) planted in Pima soil maintained higher growth and better overall health condition than on Brazito soil. Also, total water potential reached lower values in all species planted in Brazito soil rather than on Pima soil. Foliage Na and Cl concentrations on Brazito soil exceeded those on Pima soil. Survival of Cupressus seedlings was less on Brazito soil than on Pima soil. Overall, Cupressus growth was reduced the most on Brazito soil as compared with Pima soil.

40|$|Cypress (Cupressus sp. pl) is a genus {{within the}} Cupressaceae family. This family covers {{all of the}} Earth's continents except for Antarctica, and it {{includes}} about 160 species. The most important taxa for allergic diseases belong to five different genera: Cupressus, Hesperocyparis, Juniperus, Cryptomeria, and Chamaecyparis. Cupressaceae species share a common pollen type that can even include the genus Taxus (Taxaceae) when this plant is also present. As Juniperus oxycedrus pollinates in October, Cupressus sempervirens in January and February, Hesperocyparis arizonica (prev. Cupressus arizonica) in February and March, and Juniperus communis in April, the symptomatic period is long-lasting. Due to global warming, the pollination period tends to last longer, {{and there is a}} trend for Cupressaceae bioclimate niches to migrate north. In Mediterranean areas, C. sempervirens (<b>Italian</b> <b>cypress</b> or Mediterranean cypress) {{is by far the most}} common pollinating species. It accounts for half of the total pollination level. The group 1 major allergens belong to the pectate-lyase family, and members share 70 to 97 % sequence homology within the different Cupressaceae. Group 2 allergens correspond to the polygalacturonase protein family, while group 3, a minor allergen, belongs to the family of "thaumatin-like proteins," a pathogenesis-related protein 5. Group 4 allergens are Ca++-binding protein (4 EF-hands). Aside from these four groups, about 15 other allergens have been reported. Prominent among these is a basic low-molecular mass cross-reactive allergen that was identified recently, and which is suspected to be involved in pollen food syndromes which are common with peach and citrus. The prevalence of cypress allergy in the general population ranges from 0. 6 to 3 %, depending on the degree of exposure to the pollen. Depending on the geographic area and the studied population, 9 to 65 % of outpatients consulting an allergist may have sensitization to cypress pollen. Repeated cross-sectional studies performed at different time intervals have demonstrated a threefold increase in the percentage of cypress allergy around the Mediterranean area. Risk factors include a genetic predisposition and/or a strong exposure to pollen, and the natural history of cypress allergy allows identification of a subgroup of patients as allergic rather than atopic. Concerning the clinical expression, rhinitis is the most prevalent symptom, while conjunctivitis is the most disabling. Pharmacological treatment of cypress allergies is not different from that of other seasonal allergies. Immunotherapy has been used, initially by subcutaneous injections, but currently mostly through the sublingual route. Although clinical trials have included only a limited number of patients, it has proven effective and safe. Avoidance can be implemented at the individual level, as well as at the community level, through the use of alternative plants, low-pollinating cypresses, or by trimming hedges before pollination...|$|E
40|$|In this study, was {{investigated}} the elemental and chemical wood ash compositions of six dominant Greek fuels, {{before and after}} treatment with chemical retardants. A variety of techniques were used, including thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), Inductive coupled plasma emission spectroscopy, (ICP-AES), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDAX). In addition, the alkalinity of wood ash was determined by titration. The ash was prepared by combustion at low (600 °C), middle (800 °C) and high temperatures (1000 °C), following the Standard Methods. The ash composition is very important because thousands of hectares of wildlands are burned annually all over the world, producing tons of ash. The resulting deposits affect soil properties (i. e., pH) and provide a source of inorganic constituents (i. e., Ca, K, Na, Mg, etc.), while the most soluble compounds (i. e., sodium and potassium hydroxides and carbonates) do not persist through the wet season. The examined forest species were: Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine), Pinus brutia (Calabrian pine), Olea europaea (Olive), Cupressus sempervirens (<b>Italian</b> <b>cypress),</b> Pistacia lentiscus (Mastic tree), Quercus coccifera (Holly oak). The ash properties of Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine) needles before and after treatment with chemical retardants (i. e., diammonium phosphate (NH 4) 2 HPO 4 well-known as DAP), have been investigated, using the same methods. DAP is extensively used as active component in wildland fire retardants. The following crystalline compounds {{have been identified in}} ashes prepared at 600 °C before treatment with DAP: KCl, Ca(OH) 2, MgO, (CaMg) CO 3, K 2 CO 3 ·CaCO 3, K 2 CO 3, K 2 SO 4, CaO and CaCO 3, whereas CaO, MgO, K 2 SO 4, K 2 CO 3, CaCO 3, KCl and CaO, MgO, K 2 SO 4 and K 2 CO 3 at 800 and 1000 °C, respectively. The presence of DAP alters the composition of ashes converting, almost completely at high temperatures, the metallic oxides into phosphate salts. Thus, their alkalinity was decreased. The micrographs obtained by SEM indicate that pine needles ashes contain large porous particles of carbon compounds and several inorganic particles of irregular shape < 1. 0 mm, whereas after treating the needles with DAP an amorphous rigid structure was formed. To facilitate our investigation model mixtures of CaCO 3 + DAP, MgCO 3 + DAP, K 2 CO 3 + DAP were heat treated under the same conditions used for preparing the ashes. The chemical transformations taken place during heating were studied by analysing the reaction products using thermal analysis and XRD. The physical, mineralogical and chemical forest ash properties determined could be used to evaluate the environmental risk of the use of fire retardants on soils, plants and aquatic systems as well as to investigate the mechanism of combustion of forest fuels in the presence of DAP...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{numerous}} studies have been initiated {{in order to understand}} what are the microorganisms involved in forest plants diseases and the role played by phytotoxins produced in the pathogenesis processes. The aim of the present thesis was to study the fungi and the phytotoxins associated with canker disease of the <b>Italian</b> <b>cypress</b> (Cupressus sempervirens L.) and the branch dieback of juniper (Juniperus phoenicea L.) which are plant diseases with noteworthy social and economical implications. Two phytotoxic dihydrofuropyran- 2 -ones, named afritoxinones A and B, were isolated from liquid culture of Diplodia africana, a fungal pathogen responsible for branch dieback of Juniperus phoenicea L. in Italy. Additionally, six others known metabolites were isolated from the same fungus and identified as: oxysporone, sphaeropsidin A, episphaeropsidone, R-(-) -mellein, (3 R, 4 R) - 4 -hydroxymellein and (3 R, 4 S) - 4 -hydroxymellein. The structures of afritoxinones A and B were established by spectroscopic and optical methods and determined to be as (3 aS*, 6 R*, 7 aS) - 6 -methoxy- 3 a, 7 a-dihydro- 3 H, 6 H-furo[2, 3 -b]pyran- 2 -one and (3 aR*, 6 R*, 7 aS) - 6 -methoxy- 3 a, 7 a-dihydro- 3 H, 6 H-furo[2, 3 -b]pyran- 2 -one, respectively. The phytotoxic activity of afritoxinones A and B and oxysporone was evaluated on host and non-host plants by cutting and leaf puncture assay. Oxysporone proved to be the most phytotoxic compound. Sphaeropsidone is a phytotoxic dimedone methyl ether produced by Diplodia cupressi the causal agent of a canker disease of cypress in the Mediterranean area together with episphaeropsidone which was also isolated from D. africana. Eight derivatives obtained by chemical modifications and two natural analogues were assayed for phytotoxic and antifungal activities, and a structure-activity relationship was examined. Each compound was tested on non-host plants and on five fungal pathogenic species belonging to the genus Phytophthora. The results provide insights into structure-activity relationships within these compounds. It was found that the hydroxy group at C- 5, the absolute C- 5 configuration, the epoxy group, and the C- 2 carbonyl group appear to be structural features important in conferring biological activity. The conversion of sphaeropsidone into the corresponding 1, 4 -dione derivative led to a compound showing greater antifungal activity than its precursor. Furthermore white block shaped single crystals of sphaeropsidone were obtained and an X-ray diffraction study was carried out. From Diplodia cupressi were also isolated some unrearranged pimarane diterpenes named sphaeropsidins A-C. These latter and 14 derivatives obtained by their chemical modifications were assayed for antibacterial activity against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, Pseudomonas fuscovaginae, and Burkholderia glumae, the causal agents of severe bacterial rice diseases. The results showed a strong and specific activity of sphaeropsidin A against X. oryzae pv. oryzae, while no activity was observed against the other two pathogens. The results of structure-activity relationships study showed that structural features important to impart this antibacterial activity are the presence of the C- 7 carbonyl group and the hemiketalic lactone functionality. The C- 13 vinyl group, the double bond of ring C and/or the tertiary C- 9 hydroxyl group, as well as the pimarame arrangement of the tricylic carbon skeleton were also important for the antibacterial activity. This findings may be useful in devising novel compounds for practical application in agriculture...|$|E
