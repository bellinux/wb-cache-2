5|$|Ever 17 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the game's story. At certain points, they get to make a choice, which affects the {{direction}} of the story, leading to eleven possible different endings. The whole plot is not revealed in just one ending; instead, the player has to play through the game multiple times, with each playthrough revealing new information. After playing through the game once, the player is able to fast-forward past text to decision points; they can also choose to start from a point further into the game, so that they do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the beginning of the game for each playthrough.|$|E
5|$|Stan {{leads the}} kids to Terrance and Phillip, who have been cornered by the US army. La Resistance forms a human shield while Kyle tries to persuade the army and his mother against killing the two. Sheila refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip, which results in Satan, his minions, and Saddam attacking Earth. As a result, Sheila regrets everything. Saddam tries to usurp Satan's authority, but is sent back to Hell and killed, thanks to Cartman's {{malfunctioning}} V-Chip and Kenny's encouragement. Satan then grants Kenny a wish; Kenny asks for everything to return to how {{it was before the}} war, even though it means he will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Hell. He takes off his hood to say goodbye to his friends, but instead of returning to Hell, Kenny ascends to Heaven due to his act of sacrifice. Everything returns to normal in South Park.|$|E

25|$|On 2 May 2008, US President George W. Bush said he {{was asking}} Congress to approve an extra $770million funding for {{international}} food aid. On 16 October 2008, in a speech at a United Nations gathering on World Food Day, former US president Bill Clinton criticized the bipartisan coalition in Congress that blocked efforts to make some aid donations in cash rather than in food. Referring in part to policies that had pressured African governments to reduce subsidies for fertilizer and other agricultural inputs, Clinton also said:We need the World Bank, the IMF, all the big foundations, and all the governments to admit that, for 30 years, we all blew it, including me when I was President. We were wrong to believe that food was like some other product in international trade, and we all <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a more responsible and sustainable form of agriculture.The release of Japan's rice reserves onto the market may bring the rice price down significantly.

Amir eventually manages to take him back to the United States. After his adoption, Sohrab refuses to interact with Amir or Soraya until the former reminisces about Hassan and kites and shows off some of Hassan's tricks. In the end, Sohrab only gives a lopsided smile, but Amir takes it with all his heart as he runs the kite for Sohrab, saying, [...] "For you, a thousand times over." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{screenplay}} did not {{yet have}} a satisfactory ending, and, despite the producers and studio executives worried about starting filming without a set conclusion, Liman opted to finish the script during principal photography. McQuarrie at one point suggested adding a twist involving the Mimics figuring out Cage's attack on Paris and resetting time during his strike, but discarded it as [...] "you were so exhausted by the time you got to that point." [...] Eventually, McQuarrie considered that focusing on the comedic aspects meant [...] "it needed to end in a way that wasn't harsh", and thus opted to end the plot where it started, on the helicopter bringing Cage to London, fulfilling the notion that [...] "comedies generally <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the way things were".|$|E

Reviewing Chori Chori Chupke Chupke for Hindustan Times, Vinayak Chakravorty noted that [...] "there is an admirable zest that Preity pumps into every role she does". Farhan Akhtar, who directed her in two movies, believes she is an actress who [...] "can mould herself—the way she speaks, works and her body language—and adapt herself to roles," [...] while Vidhu Vinod Chopra (director of Mission Kashmir) credits her {{with the ability to}} [...] "make the viewer believe even in the most convoluted situation." [...] In a review of Salaam Namaste, Australian film critic Jake Wilson observed, [...] "While Preity Zinta isn't the subtlest actress, she's quite a comedienne– for a Hollywood equivalent to her combination of beauty, high-strung emotion and facial gymnastics you might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Natalie Wood."

500|$|Despite other R-rated horror films having {{centered}} around teenagers, {{some such as}} Scream having been successful, Bock said the second reason Jennifer's Body under-performed {{at the box office}} is the R-rating, which he described as a [...] "killer" [...] for the film. He said the film is set in high school and [...] "sounds like the perfect package for teens" [...] but that [...] "the R rating banned many teens from the theaters" [...] and the studio was left with [...] "an R-rated film marketed to whom, exactly?" [...] Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly felt that it was a slow and disappointing weekend for the box office in general; 3D animated film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was steep competition, and with low box office performances by the Matt Damon film The Informant! and Jennifer Aniston film Love Happens, she concluded that this may support [...] "the current hypothesis floating around Hollywood, that movie stars no longer matter" [...] and that it takes more than a name to open a film. S.T. VanAirsdale of Movieline echoed Sperling's sentiment about the weekend, as [...] "some of the stinkiest high-profile openings in recent memory". He concluded five reasons for Jennifer's Bodys underperformance at the box office. The first, he said, is the distributor. [...] "20th Century Fox's genre wing, Fox Atomic, had Jennifer's Body in the can by the time the mother ship shut it down last spring", he said. [...] "Instead of offloading the film to Fox Searchlight, which nimbly maneuvered Diablo Cody's previous brainchild Juno to awards-season lucre in 2007, a decision was somehow reached to fill a gap in Big Fox's early fall slate with a gory" [...] and [...] "post-feminist horror romp starring Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried". VanAirsdale classified this as a [...] "ig mistake" [...] and that [...] "ou'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> The Devil Wears Prada to find an example of a Fox release that worked without a genuine male lead; you’d probably <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Aliens to find a genre example of such that they pulled off successfully." [...] He named the second reason as the marketing, stating that the film was not well-marketed (whether by billboards, transit posters, lobby standees, or other promotional venues), even in New York.|$|E

500|$|... "Listen to the Rain on the Roof" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Marc Cherry and series writer Jeff Greenstein and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. Cherry's decision to advance the storylines by six months for the third season premiere came {{as a response to}} the series' problematic second season. Cherry stated that he regretted most of the second season, as scheduling problems made it difficult to plan the season's storylines. [...] "One of the problems I had with Season 2 was that I had to keep going with the previous year's stuff," [...] he explained. [...] "I learned you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> square one to build up the tension again." [...] The cast also expressed disappointment in the second season; James Denton considered leaving the show and Marcia Cross confessed: [...] "I've been at Marc's door plenty of times [...] going, 'You've got to be kidding.'" [...] Cherry stated that the six-month time jump would help the storylines develop quicker, as the second season's storylines lagged. He added: [...] "And I'm going to work much harder to criss-cross all the women's stories so that their lives bump up against each other." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, Hendrix {{received a}} phone call from one of his girlfriends, Devon Wilson, who had become jealous after hearing rumors that he was dating another woman, Kirsten Nefer. Nefer recalled: [...] "I heard Jimi talk to Devon... she was mad... she went into fits... Jimi said 'Devon, get off my back'". Hendrix was scheduled to perform in Rotterdam on September 13, but the show, along with three others, was cancelled due to Cox's incapacitation. During the evening of September 13, Nefer visited Hendrix at the Cumberland. After informing him that she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> work that evening, he convinced her to phone her boss, actor George Lazenby, and ask for the night off. Lazenby became angry and shouted over the phone to Nefer: [...] "You're nothing but a fucking groupie", which Hendrix overheard. The exchange upset him, and he told Nefer: [...] "Don't you ever go out to that guy again". Nefer explained to him that she had spent six months working on a film with Lazenby and that she did not want to quit her job; Hendrix eventually agreed. Nefer spent the night with him and left in the morning.|$|E
500|$|Cut {{into the}} western wall of the debating chamber are {{laminated}} glass panels, of different shapes, intended to give a human dimension to the chamber. At night, light is shone through the glass panels and is projected onto the MSPs' desks to create {{the impression that the}} chamber is never unoccupied. Natural light diffuses into the chamber and is provided by [...] "glass fins" [...] which run down from light spaces in the ceiling. Glimpses out of the chamber are given to the landscape and city beyond, intentionally, to visually connect the MSPs to Scotland. The necessities of a modern parliament, banks of light, cameras, electronic voting and the MSPs' console have all been transformed into works of craft and art, displaying the sweeping curves and leaf motifs that inform the rest of the building. Such is the level of craftsmanship, a result of the union of Miralles' inventive designs, superb detailing by RMJM and excellent craftsmanship in execution, that Jencks was prompted to state that the [...] is [...] "an arts and crafts building, designed with high-tech flair.

500|$|A major {{point of}} {{criticism}} the film faced was regarding {{the possibility of}} Army attacking students in a radio station. When Rakeysh was questioned about the same in a scriptwriter's conference conducted by the Film Writers Association in the year 2008, he said the following, [...] "So, in 2005, in Allahabad, a bunch of 4 students took the TV station there, and they were shot dead. Everything I did, {{it was kind of}} was kind of borrowed, as I said right here. Obviously, what I am also learning is the way I tell a story is not real; you can term it as a-real. For maximum impact, for the message to go through, I felt—since the story was against the establishment—let the establishment do it. After all, the establishment did hang Bhagat Singh. After all, the establishment did come down on the innocent, innocent students in Mandal Commission. After all the establishment did come down on Tiananmen Square. After all the establishment did come down when the whole concept of Flower Power emerged in America. So it's all there. It's borrowed, maybe not as realistically, but it is definitely there in the society. During emergency, there are horror stories. If we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Kriplani and his movement in Bihar, the stories are absolutely horrific." ...|$|E
500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, welcome to my life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E

[...] "Michelle was young and naive. I'm sure I'm still a little naive, but it's hard for an actor who's older to play younger," [...] said Budig. [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> being somewhat innocent, and it's hard once you're not {{to go back to}} being that way.

2500|$|Writing for Religion Dispatches, Austin Dacey {{compared}} the protest movement to Martin Luther, stating, [...] "Forget the South Park dust up; forget Everybody Draw Muhammad Day. If {{you want to}} see truly shocking anti-religious cartoons, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the sixteenth century. Near the end of Luther’s life, his propaganda campaign against Rome grew increasingly vitriolic and his language grotesquely pungent." [...] Dacey argued, [...] "The debate over cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad is often framed as a clash between free speech and religious attitudes. But it is just as much a clash between conflicting religious attitudes, and the freedom at stake is not only freedom of expression but freedom of religion. For while Luther was surely engaging in offensive speech, he was also exercising a right of freedom of conscience, which included the right to dissent from Catholic orthodoxy." ...|$|E
