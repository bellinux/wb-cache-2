5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although {{for a while}} he and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted him, {{even to the point of}} being partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as Mayor was probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding parties. On the other hand, he appears to have personally profited from the Appellants' period of rule, and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to have married at least twice, he seems to have had no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E

Until 2006, geneticists attributed most often the origin of Jewish populations to male individuals who emigrated from the Middle East and took women as wives in the indigenous populations, who later converted to Judaism.

25|$|Newcome and {{his friend}} Adam Martindale were among the Presbyterian ministers who knew of the {{preparations}} for Booth's Rebellion of August 1659 and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a wide circle of supporters among the ministers, although no specific evidence of Fisher's position. Although Fisher's patron played an initially farcical role in the events that brought about the Restoration of the monarchy, {{he was the first}} chosen of the MPs deputed to carry the Convention Parliament's response to the Declaration of Breda to Charles II. Despite all the hopes of a Presbyterian establishment, Fisher and Edgley were turned out of Thornton in the Great Ejection of 1662. The living was taken by a Mr Shaw, who had been Booth's chaplain but decided to conform to the Act of Uniformity 1662.|$|E
25|$|In 871, the Great Summer Army {{arrived from}} Scandinavia, led by Bagsecg. The {{reinforced}} Viking army turned {{its attention to}} Wessex, but the West Saxons, led by King Æthelred's brother Alfred, defeated them on 8 January 871 at the Battle of Ashdown, slaying Bagsecg in the process. Three months later, Æthelred died and was succeeded by Alfred (later known as Alfred the Great), who bought the Vikings off to gain time. During 871–72, the Great Heathen Army wintered in London before returning to Northumbria. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> had been a rebellion against the puppet ruler in Northumbria, so they returned to restore power. They then established their winter quarters for 872-73 at Torksey in the Kingdom of Lindsey (now part of Lincolnshire). The Mercians again paid them off in return for peace, {{and at the end}} of 873 the Vikings took up winter quarters at Repton in Derbyshire.|$|E

25|$|As the {{language}} of the ruling ethnicity, some type of Nubian dialect would have been the most important language. Just like in Makuria, this language was written in a variant of the Coptic alphabet. However, while this topic is still understudied <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were differences between the Old Nubian and Alodian alphabet. Erman, who studied several Alodian inscriptions, suggested that the Alodian script had five unique letters, while Monneret states that it had six. The latter also assumes that those derived from Meroitic letters. The fact that Alodia used its own dialect for writing and even developed new letters for it differs it from Makuria, where the spoken language, Old Dongolawi, was never put into writing. Except of Nubian, Greek played an important role as well. Just as it was for Alodia's northern cousin, Greek was probably a very prestigious language, used predominantly for liturgy and other religious matters. Both is spectaculary proven by the tomb stone of king David, which was written in surprisingly accurate Greek. Due to the sparse sources it's not possible to say much definite about the niveau of the Greek language among the common people. Perhaps one can draw parallels to Makuria though: There the niveau decayed over the centuries, leading to a hybrid language with a mixture of Greek and Nubian words, structured into one sentence after Nubian grammar rules. Coptic, as a language of communication with Christian Egypt, was only of limited relevance due to geographic reasons, but nevertheless do sparse written remains exist.|$|E
500|$|Children {{generally}} {{remained in}} the direct care of their mothers {{until the age of}} about eight years old, after which time it was not uncommon for the child to be placed in the foster care of another family. There were any number of reasons for a child to be [...] "put-out" [...] in this manner. Some children were placed into households to learn a trade, others to be taught to read and write. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a theological reason for fostering children, as with almost every decision in the colony. It was assumed that children's own parents would love them too much and would not properly discipline them. By placing children in the care of another family, there was little danger of them being spoiled.|$|E

2500|$|Both the Joint Planning Staff and the Chiefs of Staff Committee {{failed to}} find any virtue in Churchill's revised plan.
