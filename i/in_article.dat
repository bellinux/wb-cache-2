40|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of {{different}} chemicals used <b>in</b> common <b>articles.</b> Many hazardous substances are being spread to the environment besides from the use of articles, also from their production and disposal. Management of chemicals <b>in</b> <b>articles</b> is included <b>in</b> EU legislation concerning product safety, waste management, product design and chemicals. There are also other instruments for the management of chemicals <b>in</b> <b>articles,</b> e. g. environmental labelling, international co-operation, industry initiatives, work of the non-governmental organizations as well as national programmes and registers. According to the recommendations of the National Programme on Dangerous Chemicals, more information is needed about chemicals <b>in</b> <b>articles.</b> The aim of this preliminary report is to review how hazards and risks from chemicals <b>in</b> <b>articles</b> could be controlled, through out the life cycles of the articles. This report describes the current legislative situation and voluntary management measures, as well as their possible need for further development. Articles are regarded as e. g. textiles, toys, electrical and electronic equipment, batteries and accumulators as well as packaging. Cosmetics are also included in this report, because they present possible significant source of chemical releases to the environment. On the basis of this preliminary report, the legislation concerning chemicals <b>in</b> <b>articles</b> is very scattered, targeted to certain product groups and substances. EU’s new chemicals regulation, REACH, is the most comprehensive legislation on chemicals <b>in</b> <b>articles,</b> because it is applied to all chemicals. There is a general lack of information on the content of chemicals <b>in</b> <b>articles</b> as well as the environmental effects and risks of those chemicals. The lack of labelling requirement is affecting to the consumers’, manufacturers’ and importers’ level of knowledge about chemicals <b>in</b> <b>articles.</b> The surveillance by the authorities is based on notifications of dangerous articles and spot checks. These however only reveal a small proportion of articles on the market containing hazardous chemicals. The management of chemicals <b>in</b> <b>articles</b> could be enhanced e. g. by adding more restricted chemicals or product groups to individual legislation, by including more environmental aspects in product safety legislation or by adding more restrictions concerning chemicals <b>in</b> <b>articles</b> to the REACH Regulation. In order to supervise the compliance with chemicals legislation, more resources are needed, especially on imported articles coming outside EU. The new Waste Framework Directive and the reform of national waste legislation will enhance the control of chemicals <b>in</b> <b>articles,</b> but the collection, recycling and re-use should be further developed. Information on chemicals <b>in</b> <b>articles</b> could be increased by e. g. developing information systems covering the whole supply chain. The role of product design should be highlighted in the future when aiming to substitute the current use of hazardous chemicals <b>in</b> <b>articles...</b>|$|R

40|$|The use {{of toxic}} {{chemicals}} <b>in</b> <b>articles</b> {{is a growing concern}} for public health and the environment. International trade results in substances being transported among regions. From toys and household items to electronic equipment and automobiles, toxic substances <b>in</b> <b>articles</b> are an increasingly important factor contributing to the global burden of toxic substances. Toxic substances <b>in</b> <b>articles</b> may pose threats at every stage of the product life cycle - production, use, and disposal or recycling. In this report, we consider a factor that is critical for the sound management of substances in articles: the availability of information. At present, there is no global system for provision of information about substances {{in a wide range of}} articles. First, the report describes the problem of toxic substances <b>in</b> <b>articles,</b> with detailed case studies of selected examples and considers the advantages that would result from better information management systems. Second, the report considers existing efforts to generate and disseminate information about substances <b>in</b> <b>articles,</b> both regulatory requirements and voluntary initiatives. Third, the report offers suggestions as to the questions and themes that would need to be considered in order to improve management of information about substances <b>in</b> <b>articles...</b>|$|R

5|$|A key {{distinction}} between the bills of rights of the Commonwealth jurisdictions referred to above and the Singapore Constitution {{is that in the}} latter document, the grounds set out <b>in</b> <b>Article</b> 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in a democratic society. One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E
5|$|A {{permanent}} {{resolution of}} the capital location issue came in 1864. In 1860, the legislature put the question once again to a popular vote.
