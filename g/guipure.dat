60|$|The tall young Queen was in crimson satin with cunningly-wrought silver embroideries, {{trimmed with}} tufted silver fringe, her stomacher stiff with silver bullion studded with gold rosettes and Roman pearls, her bodice cut low to display her splendid neck, decked by a carcanet of pearls and rubies, and surmounted by a fan-like cuff of <b>guipure,</b> high behind and sloping towards the bust. Thus she {{appeared}} to the sentinel as the rays of the single lamp behind him struck fire from her red-gold hair. As if by her very gait to express the wantonness of her mood, she pointed her toes and walked with head thrown back, smiling up into the gipsy face of her companion, who was arrayed {{from head to foot}} in shimmering ivory satin, with an elegance no man in England could have matched.|$|E
60|$|The American consul at St. Kentigern stepped gloomily {{from the}} train at Whistlecrankie station. For the last twenty minutes his spirits had been slowly sinking before the {{drifting}} procession past the carriage windows of dull gray and brown hills--mammiform in shape, but so cold and sterile in expression that the swathes of yellow mist which lay in their hollows, like soiled <b>guipure,</b> seemed a gratuitous affectation of modesty. And when the train moved away, mingling its escaping steam with the slower mists of the mountain, he found himself alone on the platform--the only passenger and apparently the sole occupant of the station. He was gazing disconsolately at his trunk, which had taken upon itself a human loneliness in the emptiness of the place, when a railway porter {{stepped out of the}} solitary signal-box, where he had evidently been performing a double function, and lounged with exasperating deliberation towards him. He was a hard-featured man, with a thin fringe of yellow-gray whiskers that met under his chin like dirty strings to tie his cap on with.|$|E
60|$|The sea-fog had vanished, and {{the south}} of Scotland lay spread beneath us from sea to sea, like a map in monotint. Nay, yonder was England, with the Solway {{cleaving}} the coast--a broad, bright spearhead, slightly bent at the tip--and the fells of Cumberland beyond, mere hummocks on the horizon; all else flat as a board or as {{the bottom of a}} saucer. White threads of high-road connected town to town: the intervening hills had fallen down, and the towns, as if in fright, had shrunk into themselves, contracting their suburbs as a snail his horns. The old poet was right who said that the Olympians had a delicate view. The lace-makers of Valenciennes might have had the tracing of those towns and high-roads; those knots of <b>guipure</b> and ligatures of finest r√©seau-work. And when I considered that what I looked down on--this, with its arteries and nodules of public traffic--was a nation; that each silent nodule held some thousands of men, each man moderately ready to die in defence of his shopboard and hen-roost; it came into my mind that my Emperor's emblem was the bee, and this Britain the spider's web, sure enough.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1870s {{the second}} French empire collapsed, {{concurrently}} fashion changed. The cheaper <b>guipures</b> were affected but the better Brussels laces stayed {{in demand for}} wedding trousseaux. Designs and technique however remained much the same. [...] Individuality of lace types decreased and interest for making lace as a hobby increased. In the 1880s the lace industry revived with imitations of old laces. Aalst developed a lace with a technique based on Duchesse lace. The frequent little roses gave the lace its name: Rosaline. The same name {{has been used for}} a seventeenth century Venetian needle lace with similar design. The Belgian Rosaline was produced until the 1950s and rediscovered in 1980s. The lace is flexible to changing fashion. Worn and unsold pieces could be reassembled.|$|R
60|$|Blue {{skies and}} shining sun, but far {{down on the}} horizon one dark cloud gathers and drifts slowly upwards unobserved. Frank Crosse was aware of its shadow when coming down to breakfast he saw an {{envelope}} with a well-remembered handwriting beside his plate. How he had loved that writing once, how his heart had warmed and quickened {{at the sight of}} it, how eagerly he had read it--and now a viper coiled upon the white table-cloth would hardly have given him a greater shock. Contradictory, incalculable, whimsical life! A year ago how scornfully he would have laughed, what contemptuous unbelief would have filled his soul, if he had been told that any letter of hers could have struck him cold with the vague apprehension of coming misfortune. He tore off the envelope and threw it into the fire. But before he could glance at the letter there was the quick patter of his wife's feet upon the stair, and she burst, full of girlish health and high spirits, into the little room. She wore a pink crepon dressing-gown, with cream <b>guipure</b> lace at the neck and wrists. Pink ribbon outlined her trim waist. The morning sun shone upon her, and she seemed to him to be the daintiest, sweetest tiling upon earth. He had thrust his letter into his pocket as she entered.|$|E
60|$|But {{to go back}} to the forest. I sauntered {{forth with}} cutlass and collecting-box, {{careless}} whither I went, and careless of what I saw; for everything that I could see would be worth seeing. I know not that I found many rare or new things that day. I recollect, amid the endless variety of objects, Film-ferns of various delicate species, some growing in the moss tree-trunks, some clasping the trunk itself by horizontal lateral fronds, while the main rachis climbed straight up many feet, thus embracing the stem in a network of semi-transparent green <b>Guipure</b> lace. I recollect, too, a coarse low fern {245} on stream-gravel which was remarkable, because its stem was set with thick green prickles. I recollect, too, a dead giant tree, the ruins of which struck me with awe. The stump stood some thirty feet high, crumbling into tinder and dust, though its death was so recent that the creepers and parasites had not yet had time to lay hold of it, and around its great spur-roots lay what had been its trunk and head, piled in stacks of rotten wood, over which I scrambled with some caution, for fear my leg, on breaking through, might be saluted from the inside by some deadly snake. The only sign of animal life, however, I found about the tree, save a few millipedes and land snails, were some lizard-eggs in a crack, about the size of those of a humming-bird.|$|E
60|$|She {{smiled to}} the woman, who {{smiled back at}} her; and a fat Jewish youth in a shop doorway, seeing them smile, smiled too, as though he found them charming. Mrs. Pendyce {{had a feeling that}} the town was saying pretty things to her, and this was so strange and {{pleasant}} that she could hardly believe it, for Worsted Skeynes had omitted to say that sort of thing to her for over thirty years. She looked in the window of a hat shop, and found pleasure in the sight of herself. The window was kind to her grey linen, with black velvet knots and <b>guipure,</b> though it was two years old; but, then, she had only been able to wear it once last summer, owing to poor Hubert's death. The window was kind, too, to her cheeks, and eyes, which had that touching brightness, and to the silver-powdered darkness of her hair. And she thought: 'I don't look so very old!' But her own hat reflected in the hat-shop window displeased her now; it turned down all round, and though she loved that shape, she was afraid it was not fashionable this year. And she looked long in the window of that shop, trying to persuade herself that the hats in there would suit her, and that she liked what she did not like. In other shop windows she looked, too. It was a year since she had seen any, and for thirty-four years past she had only seen them in company with the Squire or with her daughters, none of whom cared much for shops.|$|E
