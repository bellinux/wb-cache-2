40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new logical mechanism called as Cluster Based Hierarchical Routing (CBHR) {{to improve the}} efficiency of NoC. This algorithm comprises the following steps: 1) the network is segmented logically into clusters with same size or different sizes; 2) algorithms are assigned for internal and global routing; 3) routers working functions are modified logically to support local and <b>global</b> <b>communication.</b> The <b>experiments</b> have conducted for CBHR algorithm for two dimensional mesh and torus architectures. The performance of this mechanism is analyzed and compared with other deterministic and adaptive routing algorithms in terms of energy, throughput with different packet injection ratios. </p...|$|R

In {{order to provide}} well-controlled global wire delay and efficient <b>global</b> <b>communication,</b> a packet switched Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture was proposed by different authors. In this paper, the NoC system parameters constrained by the interconnections are studied. Predictions on scaled system parameters such as clock frequency, resource size, <b>global</b> <b>communication</b> bandwidth and inter-resource delay are made for future technologies. Based on these parameters, a global wire planning scheme is proposed...|$|R
