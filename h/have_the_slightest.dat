In one report, Kubizek wrote that Stefanie loved to dance and had taken lessons.

500|$|Of {{the seven}} major New York {{newspaper}} drama reviewers, five gave the show very positive reviews. [...] For example, New York Journal American critic John McClain stated, [...] "Flower Drum Song {{is a big}} fat Rodgers and Hammerstein hit, and nothing written here will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> effect on the proceeds." [...] The New York Daily Mirror termed it, [...] "Another notable work by the outstanding craftsmen of our musical theatre... a lovely show, an outstanding one in theme and treatment." [...] Less enthusiastic, however, was the longtime New York Times critic, Brooks Atkinson, who repeatedly described it as merely [...] "pleasant". [...] UPI's drama critic, Jack Gaver, scored it as [...] "well north of Me and Juliet and Pipe Dream" [...] but [...] "well south" [...] of Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific and even the team's first flop, Allegro. [...] Ward Morehouse applauded Suzuki for having [...] "a brassy voice and the assurance of a younger Ethel Merman" [...] and termed the production [...] "an excellent Broadway show" [...] though [...] "erhaps it doesn't belong in the same world... as The King and I and Carousel." [...] Critic Kenneth Tynan, in The New Yorker magazine, alluded to the show The World of Suzie Wong in dismissing Flower Drum Song with the spoonerism, [...] "a world of woozy song".|$|E

Turkish media commented that [...] "perhaps it can explain why this money apparently failed to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> effect on efforts to prevent the deterioration of democracy in this country." ...|$|E

One day, Pu Tong Seal stood on a higher elevation at the northern part of Theizang and shouted {{at the top of his}} voice saying, [...] "If you do not give me back my captive, I will destroy your entire village." [...] Believing the threat, Theizang people returned La King into the hands of Pu Tong Seal. His father-in-law, commented, [...] "Tong Seal might really make a blunder as he has threatened us; after all, he never seems to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> remorse for what he does, nor does he seem to care about the consequences of his actions." ...|$|E

2500|$|Yet The Watchtowers public {{coverage}} of the same series of conventions was notable for its far more cautious tone. In its summary of the convention talks, the magazine reiterated the teaching that Bible chronology showed 6000 years of human existence would be completed in the mid-1970s, then pointed out: [...] "These publications have never said that the world's end would come then. Nevertheless, there has been considerable individual speculation on the matter." [...] What was certain, the magazine said, was that the end would come within the generation of those who saw the beginning of world tribulations in 1914. [...] "So we can be confident that the end is near; we do not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> doubt that God will bring it about ... {{we have to wait}} and see exactly when, in the meantime keeping busy in God's service." ...|$|E
2500|$|Members of PMP and PNL {{expressed}} {{outrage over}} the announced distribution of 18kg of food to more than 6.5 million people during the electoral campaign, in October and November. In a press release, PNL stated that [...] "in the mad rush for votes for presidential candidate Victor Ponta, PSD doesn't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> reluctance to use EU funds for masked electoral bribe". This initiative was endorsed by the Ministry of European Funds, who published on 20 September a notice of auction in which the Romanian government said it wants to provide 6,652,986 food packages within the Fund of European aid for the most deprived persons. More specifically, over 150,000 food packages {{would be sent to}} each county, totaling 100 million euros. PNL argues that the way this auction is organized raises serious questions about its legality. The Minister for European Funds, Eugen Teodorovici, said that EU funds are not used for electoral purposes and any claims of their diversion is [...] "misinformation".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{members of}} ultra-nationalist National Armed Forces (NSZ, or Narodowe Siły Zbrojne), participated in executions of Jews during wartime, {{according}} to Stefan Korboński. Other NSZ units rendered assistance {{to them and}} included Jews in their ranks as well as Polish Righteous Among the Nations. The NSZ Holy Cross Brigade rescued 280 Jewish women among some 1,000 persons from the concentration camp in Holýšov. A Jewish partisan from NSZ, Feliks Parry, suggested {{that most of them}} [...] "didn't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> notion of the ideological underpinnings of their organization" [...] and didn't care, focused only on resisting the Nazis. In postwar Poland, the communist secret police routinely tortured the NSZ insurgents in order to force them to confess to killing Jews among other alleged crimes. This was most notably the case with the 1946 trial of 23 officers of the NSZ in Lublin. The torture of political prisoners by the Ministry of Public Security did not stop automatically when the interrogations were concluded. Physical torture was also ordered if they retracted in court their confessions of [...] "killing Jews".|$|E

2500|$|On July 8, 1955, Rushmore {{appeared}} on The Tom Duggan Show in Chicago. He claimed on air {{that he was}} on a secret mission to uncover the communist assassins of former Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. Rushmore told the viewers that the leader of the [...] "Chicago Communist Party," [...] whose name was given as [...] "Lazarovich," [...] was in hiding and that Rushmore needed their help in locating him. Rushmore later disappeared from his hotel room, leading to a nationwide manhunt by the FBI. As the nation speculated that Rushmore was either kidnapped or murdered by communists, he was discovered hiding under the name [...] "H. Roberts" [...] at the Hotel Finlen in Butte, Montana. Meanwhile, news reporters found [...] "Lazarovich" [...] living in Manhattan under his real name of William Lazar. Lazar said [...] "It's a simple fact that I live quite normally in Manhattan and that any green cub reporter would not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> difficulty in locating me if he honestly wanted to." [...] Associate Director of the FBI, Clyde Tolson, wrote in the margin of a report on the disappearance: [...] "Rushmore must be a 'nut.' We should {{have nothing to do with}} him." [...] J. Edgar Hoover added: [...] "I certainly agree." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{continued}} {{being an}} outspoken observer of Serbian politics and Serb society in general. In a May 2008 interview, following the Serbian parliamentary election, {{he used the}} fact that the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of Vojislav Šešelj, Tomislav Nikolić, and Aleksandar Vučić received 1.2 million votes {{as a starting point for}} a wider comment on Serbian society: [...] "Political parties aren't the problem in Serbia. The problem here is the society that votes for those parties. I can't even begin to image what those million people that voted for SRS are like. We need to face the fact we live in a country where 50% of the population is semiliterate, uninformed, and poisoned by the media outlets with nontransparent ownership structure so that we don't know who's financing them. When a person like that gets out to vote, I'm convinced they don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> clue who it is they're really voting for. Democracy makes sense only when you've got an economically independent and well informed voter, someone who has the information and is capable of thinking. Simply counting up the votes without really knowing what's behind them is stupidity. I'm sorry, but in Serbs we have the same people that elected Slobodan Milošević on multiple occasions. Big electoral numbers do not impress me at all".|$|E
