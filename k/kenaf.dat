2500|$|Bleaching of {{wood pulp}} is the {{chemical}} processing {{carried out on}} various types of wood pulp to decrease {{the color of the}} pulp, so that it becomes whiter. The main use of wood pulp is to make paper where whiteness (similar to but not exactly the same as [...] "brightness") is an important characteristic. The processes and chemistry described in this article are also applicable to the bleaching of non-wood pulps, such as those made from bamboo or <b>kenaf.</b>|$|E
2500|$|BMW {{explained}} that {{taking advantage of}} the fact that the vehicle does not need an internal combustion engine up front, the i3 is being designed from the ground up, but avoiding to look podlike, with a dynamic sweep of the roof and the beltine to make it look sportier than most electrics. In order to achieve a lightweight car, the i3 will be the first mass production car to have most of its internal structure and body being made of carbon-fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP). [...] Like other BMW models before it, the i3 features door panels made of hemp, which mixed with plastic helps lower the weight of each panel by about 10%. Hemp fibers, left exposed, also form a design element of the car's interior. Benoit Jacob, BMW i Head of Design, said the use of natural materials like hemp and <b>kenaf</b> makes the i3's interior feel like [...] "a small loft on wheels." [...] As of November 2010, BMW had demonstrated only the light weight of the passenger compartment, and the automaker's chief executive said they had already decided on the basic design of the car and that road-testing prototypes began soon after.|$|E

50|$|The use of <b>kenaf</b> {{in paper}} {{production}} offers various environmental advantages over producing paper from trees. In 1960, the USDA surveyed more than 500 plants and selected <b>kenaf</b> {{as the most}} promising source of tree-free newsprint. In 1970, <b>kenaf</b> newsprint produced in the International Paper Company's mill in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, was successfully used by six U.S. newspapers. Printing and writing paper made from the fibrous <b>kenaf</b> plant has been offered in the United States since 1992. Again in 1987, a Canadian mill produced 13 rolls of <b>kenaf</b> newsprint which were used by four U.S. newspapers to print experimental issues. They found that <b>kenaf</b> newsprint made for stronger, brighter and cleaner pages than standard pine paper with less detriment to the environment. Due partly to <b>kenaf</b> fibres being naturally whiter than tree pulp, less bleaching is required to create a brighter sheet of paper. Hydrogen peroxide, an environmentally-safe bleaching agent that does not create dioxin, has been used with much success in the bleaching of <b>kenaf.</b>|$|E

50|$|Various reports {{suggest that}} the energy {{requirements}} for producing pulp from <b>kenaf</b> are about 20 percent less than those for wood pulp, mostly due to the lower lignin content of <b>kenaf.</b> Many of the facilities that now process Southern pine for paper use {{can be converted to}} accommodate <b>kenaf.</b>|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{as part of}} {{its overall}} effort to make {{vehicles}} more sustainable, Ford and BMW are making the material for the automobile bodies in part from <b>kenaf.</b> The first implementation of <b>kenaf</b> within a Ford vehicle was in the 2013 Ford Escape.

50|$|The Kenaf-planting project, that {{is capable}} of {{producing}} 15,000 tonnes of <b>Kenaf</b> per hectare, provides the tobacco farmers an alternative source of income when the AFTA is enforced. Under the projects initial phase, some 1,000 hectares of land would be planted with <b>Kenaf</b> including 700 hectares in Kelantan. Two Kenaf-processing mills were constructed at Air Tawar in Pasir Puteh and Beris Lalang (Bachok).The mill which is equipped with RM600,000 worth of machinery is able to process 10 tonnes of <b>Kenaf</b> during eight hours of operations daily. The processed <b>Kenaf</b> is exported to Germany and Korea.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kenaf</b> seeds yield an edible {{vegetable}} oil. The <b>kenaf</b> {{seed oil}} {{is also used}} for cosmetics, industrial lubricants and for biofuel production. <b>Kenaf</b> oil is high in omega polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which are expected {{to play a role}} in cardiovascular health. <b>Kenaf</b> seed oil contains a high percentage of linoleic acid (Omega-6) a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). Linoleic acid (C18:2) is the dominant PUFA, followed by oleic acid (C18:1). Alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3) is present in 2 to 4 percent. The PUFAs are essential fatty acids for normal growth and health. Furthermore, they are important for reducing cholesterol and heart diseases.|$|E
