5|$|A.× cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), {{a hybrid}} between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, was first {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845. Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings {{are known to}} have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> it was regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it is very similar to A.sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the early}} workers in Alberta did not {{recognize}} <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> they were finding the remains of juvenile Lambeosaurus as well. These fossils of small-bodied crested duckbills were interpreted as adults of a distinct lineage of hadrosaurids, the subfamily Cheneosaurinae. The first such animal to be named was Trachodon altidens, a left upper jaw (GSC 1092) from the Dinosaur Park Formation described by Lawrence Lambe in 1902. In the same volume, Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested T. altidens could belong to a new genus, which he labelled Didanodon without further discussion. In 2006, Lund and Gates stated that Didanodon altidens was a nomen nudum, without further discussion.|$|E
5|$|Basset's {{rewards for}} his royal service {{included}} {{a number of}} manors. Basset was granted the manor of Mixbury by the king, after the family that held <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of Domesday Book died out and it escheated to the king. Other lands held by Basset were probably royal rewards also. One was Quiddenham, which had been held in 1086 by crown. Another was Stoney Stanton, originally held in 1086 by Robert Despenser.|$|E

Vijayan (editing), Sabu Cyril (production design), and Peter Hein (stunt choreography), and the soundtrack was composed by Harris Jayaraj, who was in his first collaboration with the director. The film was touted as the director's magnum opus and was budgeted at 263.8 million, making <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of its release the most expensive South Indian film ever made. Notably, {{it was the first}} South Indian film to obtain institutional finance, and it had the highest insurance coverage available for films at that time.|$|E
5|$|Goldman pursued an {{independent}} education on her own, however, and {{soon began to}} study the political turmoil around her, particularly the Nihilists responsible for assassinating Alexander II of Russia. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> When she read Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is to Be Done? (1863), she found a role model in the protagonist Vera, who adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing cooperative. The book enthralled Goldman and remained {{a source of inspiration}} throughout her life.|$|E

5|$|The historians David Glantz and Jonathan House {{asserted}} that the original intention of the 4th Panzer Army command was to drive northwards, with its two panzer corps driving abreast, toward Oboyan and then Kursk; but that on 9 July, due to heavy Soviet resistance {{along the road to}} Oboyan, Hoth was forced to disastrously, although not knowing <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> alter his plan by ordering the II SS-Panzer Corps to swing from the northwesterly direction to the northeast toward Prokhorovka. Therefore, according to Glantz and House, the Battle of Prokhorova was not a result of original intention nor planned for, but was rather engendered by tactically flawed, late improvisations to the original German plan.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the east}} coast of the United States, Hurricane Bob {{produced}} moderate rainfall and substantial damage. Damage totaled about $1.5billion (1991USD). That included about $700million through cleanup costs, uninsured losses, and food claims. That made <b>it,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> one of the costliest United States hurricanes, although the total was due to the storm passing through a densely populated region. As of 2010, Hurricane Bob ranked as the 22nd costliest tropical cyclone in the United States mainland. Across its track, the hurricane left 2.1million people without power. There were six confirmed tornadoes, along with thirteen unconfirmed tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E

5|$|Avatar—one of {{the main}} {{developers}} of Poinciana—had long planned to connect Kinney Harmon Road with the Cypress Parkway in order to relieve congestion along Poinciana and Pleasant Hill Boulevards. However, the highway would not be built until the company was able to develop the community according to plan. Despite being included in the comprehensive land use plans of both Polk and Osceola Counties, the Polk County Commission voted in 1997 to vacate right-of-way along Kinney Harmon Road to a developer to build a 495-lot mobile home park, {{a move that would}} effectively block construction of the Poinciana Parkway. The commissioners noted that the road had been discussed for years, but there were still no plans to build <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Avatar sued the county and the 10th Judicial Circuit ruled that the commissioners did not explain why vacating the right-of-way would be in the public interest when making their decision. Osceola County had objected the commissioners' decision and helped Avatar in the case, but did not join the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|Be Here Now was {{released}} in the UK on 21 August 1997. The release date had been brought forward out of Ignition's fear that import copies of the album from the United States would arrive in Britain before that country's designated street date. Worrying that TV news cameras would interview queuing fans at a traditional midnight opening session, Ignition forced retailers to sign contracts pledging not to sell the record earlier than 8:00am. However, when the album did go on sale, the cameras showed up regardless, {{just in time to}} record the initially slow trade. It was not until lunch time that sales picked up. By {{the end of the first}} day of release, Be Here Now sold over 424,000 units and by the end of business on Saturday of that week sales had reached 663,389, making <b>it,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> the fastest-selling album in British history. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard charts in the United States kept off the #1 spot by Puff Daddy's No Way Out, but its first week sales of 152,000—below expected sales of 400,000 copies—were considered a disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him for a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the {{use of nuclear weapons}}. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E
