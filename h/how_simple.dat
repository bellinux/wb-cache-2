25|$|Still other theorists are {{developing}} a resurgence of interest in complexity theory and organizations, and have focused on <b>how</b> <b>simple</b> structures {{can be used to}} engender organizational adaptations. For instance, Miner et al. (2000) studied <b>how</b> <b>simple</b> structures could be used to generate improvisational outcomes in product development. Their study makes links to simple structures and improviser learning. Other scholars such as Jan Rivkin and Sigglekow, and Nelson Repenning revive an older interest in how structure and strategy relate in dynamic environments.|$|E
25|$|A protocell is a self-organized, self-ordered, spherical {{collection}} of lipids proposed as a stepping-stone to {{the origin of}} life. A central question in evolution is <b>how</b> <b>simple</b> protocells first arose and differed in reproductive contribution to the following generation driving the evolution of life. Although a functional protocell {{has not yet been}} achieved in a laboratory setting, there are scientists who think the goal is well within reach.|$|E
25|$|Simon was {{interested}} in how humans learn and, with Edward Feigenbaum, he developed the EPAM (Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer) theory, {{one of the first}} theories of learning to be implemented as a computer program. EPAM was able to explain a large number of phenomena in the field of verbal learning. Later versions of the model were applied to concept formation and the acquisition of expertise. With Fernand Gobet, he has expanded the EPAM theory into the CHREST computational model. The theory explains <b>how</b> <b>simple</b> chunks of information form the building blocks of schemata, which are more complex structures. CHREST has been used predominantly, to simulate aspects of chess expertise.|$|E

500|$|When Rejewski {{had been}} working on reconstructing the German {{military}} Enigma machine in late 1932, he had ultimately solved a crucial element, the wiring of the letters of the alphabet into the entry drum, with the inspired guess that they might be wired in simple alphabetical order.

500|$|Lee was a {{character}} actor and acting instructor {{with a range}} of roles in the theater and who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. [...] According to writer Michael Davis, Lee played Mr. Hooper, known for his bowtie and hornrimmed glasses, [...] "with such certainty and naturalness he made adults suspend their sense of disbelief". [...] Writer Louise A. Gikow stated that Lee was [...] "perfectly cast" [...] as Mr. Hooper. [...] According to fellow cast member Bob McGrath, who also appeared in Sesame Streets first episode with Lee, [...] "Will had a broader dimension to his character than perhaps the rest of us did... He convinced me that no matter <b>how</b> <b>simple</b> the scene was with a child, you had to bring a tremendous integrity and an honesty and credibility to it". [...] Joan Ganz Cooney, Sesame Street co-creator and president of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), said, [...] "He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have a lot to say to each other". [...] The New York Times reported that Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers.|$|E

500|$|The CSI {{effect may}} alter how crimes are committed. In 2000, {{the year that}} CSI: Crime Scene Investigation debuted, 46.9 percent of all rape cases in the United States were {{resolved}} by police. By 2005, the rate had fallen to 41.3 percent. [...] Some investigators attributed this decline to the CSI effect, as crime shows often explain in detail how criminals can conceal or destroy evidence. Several rape victims have reported that their assailants forced them to shower or clean themselves with bleach after their assaults. In December 2005, Jermaine McKinney broke into a home in Trumbull County, Ohio, where he murdered two women. [...] A fan of CSI, McKinney went to unusual lengths to remove evidence of his crime: he cleaned his hands with bleach, burned the bodies and his clothing, and attempted {{to dispose of the}} murder weapon in a lake. McKinney was eventually apprehended. Ray Peavy, head of the Los Angeles County homicide division, commented that, in addition to teaching criminals how to conceal evidence, crime shows may even [...] "encourage them when they see <b>how</b> <b>simple</b> it is to get away with [...] on television." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Marian Rejewski, the Polish {{cryptographer}} and mathematician who {{solved the}} plugboard-equipped Enigma used by Nazi Germany, approached the problem through permutation theory (whereas Knox applied linguistics) a good personal relationship was quickly {{established at the}} conference.

2500|$|While {{he did not}} {{originate}} the term, Charles Darwin {{identified the}} argument as a possible way to falsify a prediction {{of the theory of}} evolution at the outset. In The Origin of Species (1859), he wrote, [...] "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case." [...] Darwin's theory of evolution challenges the teleological argument by postulating an alternative explanation to that of an intelligent designer—namely, evolution by natural selection. By showing <b>how</b> <b>simple</b> unintelligent forces can ratchet up designs of extraordinary complexity without invoking outside design, Darwin showed that an intelligent designer was not the necessary conclusion to draw from complexity in nature. The argument from irreducible complexity attempts to demonstrate that certain biological features cannot be purely the product of Darwinian evolution.|$|E

[...] They attended The Bolles School, in Jacksonville, Florida, together. [...] There they were roommates for two years, swim team teammates, and became best friends. [...] Qupty's father, commenting on the friendship and teamwork between his Christian Arab Israeli son and his son's Jewish Israeli roommate/teammate, said: [...] "Just to see them together after the race jumping and hugging each other; they were so happy. I was looking at them through my tears. Coming from our part of the world, you don't see that." [...] The younger Qupty observed that [...] "people were amazed all the time" [...] that he – a Palestinian – and a Jew could coexist, and Shapira Bar-Or said: [...] "It shows <b>how</b> <b>simple</b> the situation is. If I can live with a Palestinian guy, I'm sure in our country we can live with a couple millions of Palestinians and Israelis together." ...|$|E
