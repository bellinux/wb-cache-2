In this paper, we argue that theories of <b>environmental</b> <b>democracy</b> lack the explanatory power to address real-life relations between people and their environment. Drawing on empirical material from recent research in the forested communities of the former coalfields of the South Wales Valleys, we identify significant rigidities, inertia and barriers that {{stand in the way}} of community participation in <b>environmental</b> <b>democracy.</b> We do this by constructing a framework for critical analysis that postulates a connection between recent shifts towards post-productivism in British forestry policy and theories of <b>environmental</b> <b>democracy.</b> Our findings point to a dissonance between, on the one hand, post-productivist forestry policy and theoretical discourses of governance, participation and <b>environmental</b> <b>democracy,</b> and, on the other hand, the actual situation of people living in the communities of the Valleys forest in South Wales...|$|E

These rights and obligations apply both to individuals and governments through constitutional, civil, administrative, commercial and even criminal legal rules. Environmental law has become an essential tool for governance and administration of sustainable development while <b>environmental</b> <b>democracy</b> and its elements are becoming essential for a safe and sound planetary cohabitation. <b>Environmental</b> <b>democracy</b> provides {{the basis for the}} policies and government actions that may ensure that the use of natural resources is equitable and sustainable at a time.

40|$|International {{environmental}} law has exerted, {{and continues to}} exert, a significant influence over the development of domestic {{environmental law}}s in Australia. Instruments such as the Rio Declaration and the Aarhus Convention are widely accepted by stakeholders as providing international standards of best practice for environmental governance. During the past, however, {{it has often been}} difficult for commentators to assess the effectiveness of domestic efforts at implementing these international standards of best practice with any degree of precision. With this in mind, The Access Initiative and the World Resources Institute have recently attempted to address this problem by creating a tool that tests the extent to which domestic environmental laws at the national level have been harmonised with international standards of best practice for access to information, public participation and access to justice in areas related to the environment as reflected in the UNEP Bali Guidelines. The tool also offers a snapshot of a nation's performance in key practice areas of environmental governance. This tool is known as the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Democracy</b> Index.

40|$|Many green {{theorists and}} policy analysts {{advocate}} democratizing environmental politics. However, despite increased attention {{to issues of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>democracy,</b> few people explain {{that there are many}} ways to be democratic, some of which serve environmental goals better than others do. This dissertation explores two key questions. First, can participatory, discursive, and communicative democratic theories be used to explain how inclusive, discussion-based environmental politics might work in practice? Second, what are the relationships among participation, issue framing, and policy design and how do these relationships influence the practical realities of environmental politics? Participatory, discursive, and communicative democratic theories provide the best normative vision for achieving fair and long-lasting solutions to environmental problems. Yet they insufficiently address several practical considerations, such as process manageability, flexibility, and the role of professional neutrals. This study opens a dialogue between democratic theories and the practical techniques of facilitation, which offers tools for identifying interests, fostering open communication, and satisfying diverse needs simultaneously. At the same time, this dialogue identifies an underdeveloped point in the facilitation literature: the importance of public participation and its relationships to framing and policy design. In order to explore these relationships, this project examines the decision-making processes of the Northwest Indiana Brownfields Redevelopment Project. Using data collected through in-depth interviews, participant observation, and document analysis, this investigation shows how participation, framing, and policy design are interconnected and reciprocal: participation shapes framing which in turn shapes policy designs, and policy designs reinforce patterns of participation and issue framing. This case study also illustrates how the values of dominant groups become the driving force behind discussions and eventual policy designs, thereby shedding new light on how political power operates within discussion-based politics. However, despite initial expectations that the case would foster democratic policymaking, its inability to foster broad stakeholder participation undermined its ability to uphold the principles of <b>environmental</b> <b>democracy.</b> ...|$|E

It presupposes and requires an “effective policy” of the rights and, particularly, the right to a suitable and ecologically balanced environment, through popular and social participation. Doctrinal guidelines and the international community have identified as environmental pillars of democracy the triple right to access: to information, to participation and to justice. This study evaluates the importance and worthlessness of the access to justice in this process. Theoretical considerations are examined in the context of constitutional and legal positivation of this right in Spain and Brazil.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{emergence}} of one particular ‘new’ environmental policy instrument: disclosure of emission and pollution data. Disclosure {{is part of a}} relatively new sub‐set of regulatory measures, based on monitoring, transparency, citizen‐empowerment and accountability. It originated in the United States but has recently attracted international attention. The attractiveness of disclosure is obvious; it promises environmental improvement combined with strengthened <b>environmental</b> <b>democracy</b> and community empowerment. By analysing the experiences in the US, and the developments in the Netherlands, this paper seeks to assess the functioning and effectiveness of disclosure. The available empirical evidence suggests that disclosure has a positive impact on the environmental performance of industrial facilities as well as a democratising effect. It is argued that Dutch policy makers wrongfully assume that disclosure cannot work in the Netherlands. The consequence is that citizens are provided with little specific information that cannot be used to put pressure on polluters...|$|E

40|$|In modern {{societies}} {{dealing with}} environmental issues {{has become a}} part of everyday life. Making decisions on waste- or water-related issues is part of the public discourse in Hungary as well. The Hungarian literature on public participation dis-cusses different participatory tools applied in particular policy fields. Public participation seems to have greater significance in environmental decisions than any other kind of democratic de-cision making processes. These experiences raise the question of ‘why should the public participate in making environmental decisions? ’ In this paper we are looking for the answers to this question analysing the literature on public participation and ex-ploring the relevant theoretical approaches. Arguments based on democracy theories, communication theory, sustainability, <b>environmental</b> <b>democracy,</b> risk research and behavioural eco-nomics will be summarized. The paper presents an analysis of how these different theoretical approaches treat public partici-pation in environmental decision making and what arguments they present for its justification.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} 35 {{years of}} Japanese environmental policy {{with reference to}} the results of the past three Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) environmental performance reviews and a policy stage analysis. A comparison with European Union (EU) and US environmental policies is used to evaluate current policy designed to attain the targcts sct by the Kyoto Protocol and consider future options for creating a Japanese society capable of meeting the challenges of climate change. In the 1980 s, Japanese policy measures to decouple economic growth and the emission of pollutants met with great success, particularly in the case of sulphur dioxide emissions. However, this decoupling trend ceased in the 1990 s and the emission of major greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide continued to rise. This paper, therefore, advocates substantial structural changes in environmental policy that go far beyond the technological and voluntary measures employed in the 1970 s and 1980 s. These include wide-ranging incentives such as ecological tax reforms and domestic emissions trading, as well as calls for the empowering of local initiatives and the realization of <b>environmental</b> <b>democracy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Democracy is {{not just}} a set of values by which we might want to assess the {{adequacy}} of any environmental governance arrangements. Rather, democracy proves integral to effective earth system governance. Thinking effectively about democracy here requires moving beyond the ecologically problematic history of the liberal democratic states that currently populate {{a large part of the}} world, and a still larger part of the imagination of many of those who think about democracy. But even if it supplies no compelling normative models, this history does hold many lessons. After looking at some of these lessons, I will undertake a more analytical treatment of democracy and earth system governance, with some applications to climate change. Earth systems need to be matched by deliberative systems; it is in connection with deliberative democracy that <b>environmental</b> <b>democracy</b> can most profitably be pursued. There is now a substantial literature on deliberative democracy and the environment (Smith 2003; Baber and Bartlett 2005).
