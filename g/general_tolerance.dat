25|$|Some Donatists {{sought to}} become martyrs by provocative acts. A disorderly, rural extremist group became {{associated}} with the Donatists, the circumcellions, who opposed taxes, debt collection, and slavery, and would obstruct normal commerce {{in order to protect}} the poor. The Donatist schism also became later linked to two revolts led by the Berber half-brothers, Firmus (372–375), and then Gildo (395–398). As a bishop Augustine came to condemn the Donatists throngs for rioting; at one time there were Imperial persecutions. Church negotiations lasted about a century until finally the Catholics declared Donatism a heresy in 405, though <b>general</b> <b>tolerance</b> persisted until the ban became enforced late in the 6th century.|$|E
25|$|While fear of rape is {{typically}} associated with being outside the home, {{the great majority of}} sexual violence actually occurs in the home of the victim or the abuser. Nonetheless, abduction by a stranger is quite often the prelude to a rape and the opportunities for such an abduction are influenced by the physical environment. The social environment within a community is, however, usually more important than the physical surrounding. How deeply entrenched in a community beliefs in male superiority and male entitlement to sex are will greatly affect the likelihood of sexual violence taking place, as will the <b>general</b> <b>tolerance</b> in the community of sexual assault and the strength of sanctions, if any, against perpetrators. For instance, in some places, rape can even occur in public, with passersby refusing to intervene. Complaints of rape may also be treated leniently by the police, particularly if the assault is committed during a date or by the victim's husband.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} salient {{differences}} between European and Brazilian Portuguese is their prosody. European Portuguese is a stress-timed language, with reduction, devoicing or even deletion of unstressed vowels and a <b>general</b> <b>tolerance</b> of syllable-final consonants. Brazilian Portuguese, on the other hand, is of mixed characteristics, and varies according to speech rate, sex and dialect. At fast speech rates, Brazilian Portuguese is more stress-timed, while in slow speech rates, it can be more syllable-timed. The accents of rural, southern Rio Grande do Sul and the Northeast (especially Bahia) are considered to sound more syllable-timed than the others, while the southeastern dialects such as the mineiro, in central Minas Gerais, the paulistano, of the northern coast and eastern regions of São Paulo, and the fluminense, along Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and eastern Minas Gerais as well the Federal District, are most frequently essentially stress-timed. Also, male speakers of Brazilian Portuguese speak faster than female speakers and speak in a more stress-timed manner, and with a lighter reduction of unstressed vowels, less raising of pre-stress vowels, less devoicing and fewer deletions.|$|E

500|$|The {{main problem}} of the chronic use of benzodiazepines is the {{development}} of tolerance and dependence. Tolerance manifests itself as diminished pharmacological effect and develops relatively quickly to the sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant actions of benzodiazepines. Tolerance to anti-anxiety effects develops more slowly with little evidence of continued effectiveness beyond four to six months of continued use. In <b>general,</b> <b>tolerance</b> to the amnesic effects does not occur. However, controversy exists as to tolerance to the anxiolytic effects with some evidence that benzodiazepines retain efficacy and opposing evidence from a systematic review of the literature that tolerance frequently occurs and some evidence that anxiety may worsen with long-term use. The question of tolerance to the amnesic effects of benzodiazepines is, likewise, unclear. Some evidence suggests that partial tolerance does develop, and that, [...] "memory impairment is limited to a narrow window within 90 minutes after each dose".|$|E
2500|$|Accounts of StFagan and his {{companion}} Deruvian joined a long-standing narrative concerning KingLucius of Britain and his conversion to Christianity {{around the time}} of the Roman Emperors Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, a time of <b>general</b> <b>tolerance</b> towards the religion. StGildas had described the first apostles as arriving during the reign of the emperor Tiberius. William of Malmesbury's cautious account in the Deeds of the Kings of the English allows that StPhilip may have reached the island but quickly leaves such [...] "vain imaginations" [...] in favor of praising the ancient wattle chapel of StMary erected by Pope Eleutherius's nameless missionaries, which he called [...] "the oldest I am acquainted with in England". (The precise antiquity of the church was part of a bitter dispute over seniority between the abbey and Westminster over the primacy of their foundations.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Donatist schism {{was a major}} disruption; it {{followed}} a severe Roman persecution of Christians ordered by the Emperor Diocletian (r.284–305). An earlier persecution had caused divisions over whether or how to accept back into the church contrite Christians who had apostatized under state threats, abuse, or torture. Then in 313 the new Emperor Constantine by the Edict of Milan had granted tolerance to Christianity, himself becoming a Christian. This turnabout led to confusion in the Church, which in North Africa accentuated the divide between wealthy urban members aligned with the Empire, and the local rural poor whose beliefs included social and political dissidence. Christian Berbers tended to be Donatists, although some more assimilated Berbers were Catholic. [...] The Donatists became centered in southern Numidia, the Catholics in Carthage. One issue was whether a priest could perform his spiritual office if not personally worthy. The Donatist schismatics set up parallel churches in order to practice a ritual purity not required by the Catholic Church. Augustine the Bishop came to condemn the Donatists throngs for rioting; at one time there were Imperial persecutions. Long negotiations lasted until finally the Catholics declared Donatism a heresy in 405, though <b>general</b> <b>tolerance</b> persisted until the ban became enforced late in the 6th century.|$|E

50|$|The Automation {{process is}} a widely {{accepted}} form of production that has made great leaps and bounds in the production process as a whole.

These drivers are often running languages that support 6, 7, and 8 axis controls for sophisticated robotics.|$|R

6000|$|As to {{the mythical}} {{habits of the}} Aztec Olympians in general, Sahagun observes that [...] "they were friends of disguise, and changed {{themselves}} often into birds or savage beasts". Hence he, or his informants, infer that the gods have originally been necromancers or medicine-men, now worshipped after death; a natural inference, as magical feats of shape-shifting are commonly ascribed [...] "everywhere to witches and warlocks". As a matter of fact, the Aztec gods, though bedizened with the attributes of mortal conjurors, and with the fur and feathers of totems, are, for the most part, the departmental deities of polytheism, each ruling over some province of nature or of human activity. Combined with these are deities who, in their origin, were probably ideal culture-heroes, like Yehl, or Qat, or Prometheus. The long and tedious myths of Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca appear to contain memories of a struggle between the gods or culture-heroes of rival races. Such struggles were natural, and necessary, perhaps, before a kind of syncretism and a <b>general</b> <b>tolerance</b> could unite in peace the deities of a realm composed of many tribes originally hostile. In a cultivated people, made up out of various conquered and amalgamated tribes, we must expect polytheism, because their Olympus {{is a kind of}} divine representative assembly. Anything like monotheism, in such a state, must be the result of philosophic reflection. [...] "A laughable matter it is," [...] says Bernal Diaz, [...] "that in each province the Indians have their gods, and the gods of one province or town are of no profit to the people of another. Thus have they an infinite number of idols, to each of which they sacrifice."* ...|$|E
