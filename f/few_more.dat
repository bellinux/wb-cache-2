5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} crossed Central America organized and {{developed into a}} tropical depression on June 27. Contrary to forecasts, the depression did not strengthen further because of strong wind shear. By June 29, the depression had become a remnant low, which was observed as a swirl of clouds for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> days before dissipating.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{advances}} in vehicle electronics {{have led to}} a move towards <b>fewer,</b> <b>more</b> capable computer processors on a vehicle. A typical vehicle in the early 2000s would have between 20 and 100 individual networked microcontroller/Programmable logic controller modules with non-real-time operating systems. The current trend is toward <b>fewer,</b> <b>more</b> costly microprocessor modules with hardware memory management and real-time operating systems. The new embedded system platforms allow for more sophisticated software applications to be implemented, including model-based process control, artificial intelligence, and ubiquitous computing. Perhaps {{the most important of these}} for Intelligent Transportation Systems is artificial intelligence.|$|R

5|$|M-34 was {{designated}} and {{signed with the}} beginning of the state highway system around July1, 1919, along a route that extended to either end of its current routing. These western and eastern extensions were added to other highways during the 1920s, shortening M-34 to roughly its current length. A <b>few</b> <b>more</b> changes were made in the mid-1950s and 1960s resulting in the modern routing. M-34 has a short, unsigned sibling, Connector 34, which is better known as Industrial Drive in the Adrian area.|$|E

5|$|The French did {{not pursue}} the Austrians {{immediately}} {{because they were}} exhausted from two straight days of vicious fighting. After recuperating, they chased the Austrians and caught up with them at Znaim in mid-July. Here Charles signed an armistice with Napoleon and agreed to end the fighting. Military conflict between France and Austria was effectively ended, although a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> months of diplomatic wrangling were required to make the result official.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} published {{discovery of}} a moon other than the Earth's was by Galileo Galilei, who discovered the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. Over the following three centuries only a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> moons were discovered. Missions to other planets in the 1970s, most notably the Voyager 1 and 2 missions, saw a surge {{in the number of}} moons detected, and observations since the year 2000, using mostly large, ground-based optical telescopes, have discovered many more, all of which are irregular.|$|E

5|$|The {{season ended}} with a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> matches against English counties. Miller struck {{aggressive}} half-centuries in wins against Nottinghamshire and Leveson-Gower's XI. In first-class matches, Miller had scored 725 runs at 72.50 for the season, finishing second in both averages and aggregates. The success of the Australian Services prompted a fundraising tour of India and Ceylon on their return to Australia.|$|E

5|$|While doing {{research}} for his decorations, he read in an American magazine the article Comics in your Life. Fascinated, Vandersteen searched {{for more information}} on the subject. He rediscovered Hergé with The Adventures of Tintin in Le Petit Vingtième, but also the realistic work of Hal Foster in Prince Valiant. But it took a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> years before this fascination translated into steady publication of his own comics. Meanwhile, his first published drawings appeared in Entre Nous, the internal magazine of L'Innovation.|$|E

The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E
5|$|A third {{milestone}} in Wodehouse's life came {{towards the end}} of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, Very Good Eddie, running at the Princess Theatre in New York. The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was Miss Springtime (1916), which ran for 227 performances—a good run {{by the standards of the}} day. The team produced several more successes, including Leave It to Jane (1917), Oh, Boy! (1917–18) and Oh, Lady! Lady!! (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse's lyrics won high praise from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as Ira Gershwin.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 26. It was {{upgraded to}} {{a tropical storm}} and named Genevieve the next day. It moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane, peaking in intensity on August 28. At that point, the cyclone encountered cooler waters, which caused it to weaken slowly, weakening to a depression on August 30. The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2. A swirl of remnant clouds persisted for a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> days. Genevieve had no impact on land, with no reports of casualties or damage being received by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cunégonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.|$|E

When they had {{exhausted}} their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked arrows off {{the ground in front}} of them—arrows loosed by their foes—and continued loosing. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position to engage the Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers shot a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> volleys before retreating behind their ranks of men-at-arms, leaving thousands of arrows in the ground to hinder the Lancastrian attack.|$|E
