5|$|The diamond can {{be split}} by a single, well {{calculated}} blow of a hammer to a pointed tool, which is quick, but risky. Alternatively, {{it can be}} cut with a <b>diamond</b> <b>saw,</b> which is a more reliable but tedious procedure.|$|E
5|$|Thin {{sectioning}} was {{an early}} procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. The process required cutting a coal ball with a <b>diamond</b> <b>saw,</b> then flattening and polishing the thin section with an abrasive. It would be glued to a slide and placed under a petrographic microscope for examination. Although the process could be done with a machine, {{the large amount of}} time needed and the poor quality of samples produced by thin sectioning gave way to a more convenient method.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Heterodontosaurus tucki (SAM-PK-K337) was discovered during the British-South African expedition to South Africa and Basutoland (former name of Lesotho) in 1961-1962. Today, it {{is housed in}} the Iziko South African Museum. It was excavated on a mountain {{at an altitude of}} about , at a locality called Tyinindini, in the district of Transkei (sometimes referred to as Herschel) in the Cape Province of South Africa. The specimen consists of a crushed but nearly complete skull; associated postcranial remains mentioned in the original description could not be located in 2011. The animal was scientifically described and named in 1962 by palaeontologists Alfred Walter Crompton from South Africa and Alan J. Charig from the United Kingdom. The genus name refers to the different-shaped teeth, and the specific name honors George C. Tuck, a director of Austin Motor Company, who supported the expedition. The specimen was not fully prepared by the time of publication, so only the front parts of the skull and lower jaw were described, and the authors conceded that their description was preliminary, serving mainly to name the animal. It was considered an important discovery, as few early ornithischians were known at the time. The preparation of the specimen, i.e. the freeing of the bones from the rock matrix, was very time consuming, since they were covered in a thin, very hard, ferruginous layer containing haematite. This could only be removed by a <b>diamond</b> <b>saw,</b> which damaged the specimen.|$|E

500|$|On November 12, 2014, the {{supporting}} wire rope cables of a suspended working platform slacked. The cables were manufactured by Tractel, {{and they were}} used to hold workers who performed maintenance on the building's exterior. At the time, the platform was holding a two-man, SEIU-affiliated window washing team. The slack caused the platform to hang almost vertically near the 68th floor of the tower. The workers were rescued by over 100 FDNY firefighters, who used a <b>diamond</b> <b>saw</b> to cut through the glass. After the incident, the workers suffered from a slight case of hypothermia, and were taken to the hospital.|$|E
500|$|The {{thin section}} {{technique}} was superseded by the now-common liquid-peel technique in 1928. In this technique, peels are obtained by cutting {{the surface of}} a coal ball with a <b>diamond</b> <b>saw,</b> grinding the cut surface on a glass plate with silicon carbide to a smooth finish, and etching the cut and the surface with hydrochloric acid. The acid dissolves the mineral matter from the coal ball, leaving a projecting layer of plant cells. After applying acetone, a piece of cellulose acetate is placed on the coal ball. This embeds the cells preserved in the coal ball into the cellulose acetate. Upon drying, the cellulose acetate can be removed from the coal ball with a razor and the obtained peel can be stained with a low-acidity stain and observed under a microscope. Up to 50peels can be extracted from [...] of coal ball with this method.|$|E

The process of wire saw manufacturing and the selection of optimal parameters are introduced. The experiments of the slicing marble are carried out using different <b>diamond</b> wire <b>saws.</b> The effects of wire saw running speed, work-piece in-feed speed, work-piece rotation frequency on the material removal rate, and surface roughness were investigated.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the basic rule of <b>diamond</b> wire <b>saw</b> slicing SiCp-Al composites, the {{theoretical}} analysis and experiments were carried out. The influences of <b>diamond</b> wire <b>saw</b> slicing speed and workpiece feed speed on surface quality and machining efficiency were discussed. The analysis {{results show that the}} machined surface gets smoother when <b>diamond</b> wire <b>saw</b> slicing speed changes from 2 m/s to 3. 5 m/s, but gets rougher when <b>diamond</b> wire <b>saw</b> slicing speed changes from 3. 5 m/s to 4 m/s. And the surface gets rougher when workpiece feed speed changes from 0. 5 m/s to 1 m/s. The machining efficiency gets higher when <b>diamond</b> wire <b>saw</b> slicing speed and workpiece feed speed increase. These results provide guidance for selecting reasonable parameters in future research...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>diamond</b> gang <b>saw</b> blade {{is a long}} {{steel plate}} with diamond {{segments}} welded onto it. Normally, tens or hundreds of <b>diamond</b> gang <b>saw</b> blades are used together to saw raw stone blocks.|$|R
5000|$|Choosing {{a proper}} <b>diamond</b> <b>saw</b> blade for the {{concrete}} saw {{is a necessary}} condition to perform a cutting task well.

5000|$|The {{match between}} the <b>diamond</b> <b>saw</b> blade's {{features}} and the concrete/asphalt's type. For example, some concretes have steel bars in them (reinforced concrete) {{and some do}} not have. Some concretes' stone aggregate is pebbles and some is crushed rocks. Some concretes' curing time is long (cured concrete) and some is short (green concrete). The <b>diamond</b> <b>saw</b> blades should have different design to fit these concrete and asphalt.|$|E
40|$|It is a {{currently}} dominant {{method to}} use wire saws for cutting silicon material {{because of its}} production efficiency and energy efficiency. <b>Diamond</b> wire <b>saws,</b> or fixed abrasive wire saws, have attracted much attention to researchers and engineers due to many advantages, including high cutting efficiency and low environmental pollution. This paper develops a novel <b>diamond</b> wire <b>saw</b> using ultraviolet curing technology. High-strength piano wires and polyethylene wires are selected as wire cores, and photosensitive resin is used as the binder. The problem of wire saw strength is mathematically formulated, and the effective parameters are analyzed. The surface morphology is analyzed for the developed <b>diamond</b> wire <b>saw.</b> A series of cutting experiments with different saws of varying manufacturing parameters are carried out. The slicing performance of such <b>diamond</b> wire <b>saws</b> is evaluated and compared. The experimental {{results show that the}} developed saw using the photosensitive resin has a very good performance in slicing silicon ingots. By the comparison between the developed <b>diamond</b> wire <b>saw</b> and the electroplated <b>diamond</b> wire <b>saw,</b> the surface smoothness of the workpiece is better than that by the latter...|$|R
25|$|Quarries {{that produce}} {{dimension}} stone or crushed stone (used as construction aggregate) are interconvertible. Since most quarries can produce either one, a crushed stone quarry {{can be converted}} to dimension stone production. However, first the stone shattered by heavy and indiscriminate blasting must be removed. Dimension stone is separated by more precise and delicate techniques, such as <b>diamond</b> wire <b>saws,</b> <b>diamond</b> belt <b>saws,</b> burners (jet-piercers), or light and selective blasting with Primacord, a weak explosive.|$|R

50|$|Diamond: Fixed {{onto the}} saw blade's base to form <b>diamond</b> <b>saw</b> blades. As diamond is a superhard material, <b>diamond</b> <b>saw</b> blades {{can be used}} to cut hard brittle or {{abrasive}} materials, for example, stone, concrete, asphalt, bricks, ceramics, glass, semiconductor and gem stone. There are many methods used to fix the diamonds onto the blades' base and there are various kinds of <b>diamond</b> <b>saw</b> blades for different purposes. High speed steel (HSS): The whole saw blade is made of High Speed Steel (HSS). HSS saw blades are mainly used to cut steel, copper, aluminum and other metal materials. If high-strength steels (e.g., stainless steel) are to be cut, the blades made of cobalt HSS (e.g. M35, M42) should be used.|$|E
