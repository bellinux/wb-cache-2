50|$|Opposite {{potentials}} are induced in {{the secondary}} when the interrupter 'breaks' the circuit and 'closes' the circuit. However, the current change in the primary is much more abrupt when the interrupter 'breaks'. When the contacts close, the current builds up slowly in the primary because the supply voltage has a limited ability to force current through the coil's inductance. In contrast, when the interrupter contacts open, the current falls to zero suddenly. So the pulse of voltage induced {{in the secondary}} at 'break' is {{much larger than the}} pulse induced at 'close', it is the 'break' that generates the coil's <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E

50|$|High {{voltage power}} {{supplies}} typically apply {{the bulk of}} their input energy to a power inverter, which in turn drives a voltage multiplier or a high turns ratio, high voltage transformer, or both (usually a transformer followed by a multiplier) to produce high voltage. The high voltage is passed out of the power supply through the special connector, and is also applied to a voltage divider that converts it to a low voltage metering signal compatible with low voltage circuitry. The metering signal is used by a closed-loop controller that regulates the high voltage by controlling inverter input power, and it may also be conveyed out of the power supply to allow external circuitry to monitor the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
50|$|An arc forms at the {{interrupter}} contacts at 'break' which consumes {{energy stored}} in the coil, slowing {{the rate of change}} of primary current, reducing the output voltage. To prevent this a capacitor (C) of 0.5 to 15 μF is connected across the contacts to increase the speed of switching on 'break', producing much higher voltages. It also prevents damage to the contacts by the arc. The capacitor and primary winding together form a tuned circuit, so on break an oscillating decaying sinusoidal current flows in the primary. This induces a sinusoidal voltage in the secondary. As a result: the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>output</b> pulse at each break actually consists of a rapidly alternating series of positive and negative pulses (left) which decay rapidly to zero.|$|E
5000|$|An Oudin coil, {{also called}} an Oudin {{oscillator}} or Oudin resonator, is a resonant transformer circuit that generates very high voltage, high frequency alternating current (AC) electricity at low current levels, [...] {{used in the}} obsolete medical field of electrotherapy {{around the turn of}} the 20th century. [...] It is very similar to a Tesla coil, with the difference being that the Oudin coil was connected as an autotransformer.

5000|$|The tube is {{attached}} to a manifold which is itself attached to a high-quality vacuum pump. The tube is then evacuated of air until it reaches a vacuum level of a few torr. The evacuation is paused, and a high current is forced through the low-pressure air in the tube via the electrodes (in a process known as [...] "bombarding"). This current and voltage is far above the level that occurs in final operation of the tube. The current depends on the specific electrodes used and the diameter of the tube, but is typically in the 150 mA to 1500 mA range, starting low and increasing {{towards the end of the}} process to ensure that the electrodes are adequately heated without melting the glass tube. The bombarding current is provided by a large transformer with an open-circuit voltage of roughly 15,000VAC to 23,000VAC. The bombarding transformer acts as an adjustable constant current source, and the actual voltage during operation depends on the length and pressure of the tube. Typically the operator will maintain the pressure as high as the bombarder will allow to ensure maximum power dissipation and heating. Bombarding transformers may be specially made for this use, or may be repurposed electrical utility distribution transformers (the type seen mounted on utility poles) operated backwards to produce a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
