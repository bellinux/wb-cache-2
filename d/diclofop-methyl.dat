40|$|Lolium rigidum biotype SR 4 / 84 is {{resistant}} to the herbicides <b>diclofop-methyl</b> and chlorsulfuron when grown in the field, in pots, and in hydroponics. Similar extractable activities and affinities for acetyl-coenzyme A of carboxylase (ACCase), an enzyme inhibited by <b>diclofop-methyl,</b> were found for susceptible and resistant L. rigidum. ACCase activity from both biotypes was inhibited by <b>diclofop-methyl,</b> diclofop acid, haloxyfop acid, fluazifop acid, sethoxydim, and tralkoxydim but not by chlorsulfuron or trifluralin. Exposure of plants to <b>diclofop-methyl</b> did not induce any changes in either the extractable activities or the herbicide inhibition kinetics of ACCase. It is concluded that, in contrast to diclofop resistance in L. multiflorum and diclofop tolerance in many dicots, the basis of resistance to <b>diclofop-methyl</b> and to other aryloxyphenoxypropionate and cyclohexanedione herbicides in L. rigidum is not due to the altered inhibition characteristics or expression of the enzyme ACCase. The extractable activities and substrate affinity of acetolactate synthase (ALS), an enzyme inhibited by chlorsulfuron, from susceptible and resistant biotypes of L. rigidum were similar. ALS from susceptible and resistant plants was equally inhibited by chlorsulfuron. Prior exposure of plants to 100 millimolar chlorsulfuron {{did not affect the}} inhibition kinetics.

40|$|Growth and {{electrophysiological}} {{studies in}} roots of intact <b>diclofop-methyl</b> susceptible and resistant seedlings {{were conducted to}} test the hypothesis that the herbicide acts primarily as a proton ionophore. The ester formulation of diclofop, at 0. 2 micromolar, completely inhibited root growth in herbicide-susceptible oat (Avena sativa L.) after a 96 hour treatment, but induced only a delayed transient depolarization of the membrane potential in oat root cortical cells. Root growth in susceptible maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings was dramatically reduced by exposure to 0. 8 micromolar <b>diclofop-methyl,</b> while the same <b>diclofop-methyl</b> exposure hyperpolarized the membrane potential within 48 hours after treatment. Furthermore, exposure of maize roots to the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (50 nanomolar), inhibited growth by only 31 %, 96 hours after treatment, while the same CCCP exposure depolarized the resting potential by an average of 32 millivolts. Thus, the protonophore hypothesis cannot account for a differential membrane response to phytotoxic levels of <b>diclofop-methyl</b> in two susceptible species. From the results of others, much of the evidence to support the protonophore hypothesis was obtained using high concentrations of diclofop acid (100 micromolar). At a similar concentration, we also report a rapid (3 minute) diclofop-induced depolarization of the membrane potential in roots of susceptible oat and maize, moderately tolerant barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and resistant pea (Pisum sativum L.) seedlings. Moreover, 100 micromolar diclofop acid inhibited growth in excised cultured pea roots. In contrast, 100 micromolar <b>diclofop-methyl</b> did not inhibit root growth. Since the membrane response to 100 micromolar diclofop acid does not correspond to differential herbicide sensitivity under field conditions, results obtained with very high levels of diclofop acid are probably physiologically irrelevant. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the effect of <b>diclofop-methyl</b> on the membrane potentials of susceptible species is probably unrelated to the primary inhibitory effect of the herbicide on plant growth...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} much debate {{regarding}} the potential for reduced rates of herbicide application to accelerate evolution of herbicide resistance. We report a series of experiments that demonstrate the potential for reduced rates of the acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) -inhibiting herbicide <b>diclofop-methyl</b> to rapidly select for resistance in a susceptible biotype of Lolium rigidum. Thirty-six percent of individuals from the original VLR 1 population survived application of 37. 5 g <b>diclofop-methyl</b> ha(- 1) (10 % of the recommended field application rate). These individuals were grown to maturity and bulk-crossed to produce the VLR 1 low dose-selected line VLR 1 (0. 1). Subsequent comparisons of the dose-response characteristics of the original and low dose-selected VLR 1 lines demonstrated increased tolerance of <b>diclofop-methyl</b> in the selected line. Two further rounds of selection produced VLR 1 lines that were resistant to field-applied rates of <b>diclofop-methyl.</b> The LD 50 (<b>diclofop-methyl</b> dose required to cause 50 % mortality) of the most resistant line was 56 -fold {{greater than that of}} the original unselected VLR 1 population, indicating very large increases in mean population survival after three cycles of selection. In vitro ACCase inhibition by diclofop acid confirmed that resistance was not due to an insensitive herbicide target-site. Cross-resistance studies showed increases in resistance to four herbicides: fluazifop-P-butyl, haloxyfop-R-methyl, clethodim and imazethapyr. The potential genetic basis of the observed response and implications of reduced herbicide application rates for management of herbicide resistance are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{combined}} water stress and <b>diclofop-methyl</b> treatment on photosynthesis and carotenoid and abscisic acid (ABA) content of leaves of A. byzantina and A. fatua was investigated. Sublethal doses of <b>diclofop-methyl</b> caused a transient decline in {{net assimilation rate}} {{and a decrease in}} β-carotene and zeaxanthin in leaves of both species. The decline in carotenoid levels occurred concomitant with a substantial but transient increase in ABA. A similar but less dramatic trend was observed for water-stressed plants. Recovery of photosynthesis in seedlings exposed simultaneously to <b>diclofop-methyl</b> and water stress, was associated with an increase in β-carotene and zeaxanthin contentand a return to basal ABA levels in leaves of A. byzantina. By comparison, substantial accumulation of zeaxanthin was observed in leaves of A. fatua following combined water stress and herbicide treatment, apparently at the expense of ABA. Similar findings were made regarding levels of zeaxanthin when <b>diclofop-methyl</b> was applied to already water-stressed plants of A. byzantina and A. fatua. It is proposed that herbicide- and/or water-stress-induced alterations in acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase activity coupled with reduced demand for fatty acid synthesis, facilitate channelling of photosynthetically fixed carbon into isoprenoids and that alterations in the capacity for terpenoid synthesis forms part of the mechanism by which drought stress antagonizes the activity of aryloxyphenoxypropionic acid herbicides...|$|E

Crop damage was more severe in 1978 than 1979. Olympic, Shortim, Teal and Warimba were consistently susceptible to barban, while Condor, Cook, Egret and Oxley were more tolerant than the other cultivars. The differences between cultivars treated with <b>diclofop-methyl</b> were smaller and variable.

Thus, this experiment was conducted in 1995 - 96 at the Agricultural Research Station, Isfahan University of Technology, in order to investigate the issue. In this study, 2, 4 -D+MCPA (U 46 Combi Fluid 6), bromoxynil, metribuzin, <b>diclofop-methyl</b> and tralkoxydim and their combinations in 11 treatments plus weed-free and weedy checks were evaluated using a randomized complete block design with 4 replications. Goldbachia laevigata and Avena fatua were the dominant weeds. Cirsium arvense and Convolvulus arvensis were of less importance. Efficacy of bromoxynil on annual broadleaf weeds was higher than 2, 4 -D+MCPA, while 2, 4 -D+MCPA was more effective on perennial broadleaf weeds. <b>Diclofop-methyl</b> and combination of bromoxynil with tralkoxydim were the most effective on A. fatua, while differences between treatments containing <b>diclofop-methyl</b> or tralkoxydim on decreasing A. fatua numbers were non-significant. The most and the least visual damages to wheat plants were caused by metribuzin and bromoxynil, respectively. Wheat yield was not significantly affected by treatments.

Foi instalado um experimento de campo e outro de casa-de-vegetação. Os tratamentos testados no experimento de campo foram <b>diclofop-methyl</b> (540 g/ha), fenoxaprop-ethyl (180 g/ha), haloxyfop-methyl (120 g/ha) e uma testemunha sem tratamento herbicida, aplicados sobre as cultivares 'CTC- 1 ', 'UFRGS- 7 ' e 'UPF- 16 ' de aveia branca, e em aveia-preta. No experimento de casa-de-vegetação testaram-se três doses de fenoxaprop-ethyl (0, 90 e 120 g/ha), aplicadas sobre sete cultivares de trigo ('BR- 23 ', 'BR- 35 ', 'BR- 38 ', 'E- 16 ', 'E- 40 ', 'E- 49 ' e 'E- 52 '), aveia-branca, aveia-preta e azevém. Como resultados do ensaio de campo, constatou-se que todos os herbicidas testados controlaram com eficiência (acima de 90 %) as cultivares de aveia-branca. A aveia-preta mostrou alta sensibilidade ao fenoxaprop-ethyl e ao haloxyfop-methyl e alguma tolerância ao diclofop-methyl; já o trigo mostrou-se tolerante ao <b>diclofop-methyl</b> e ao fenoxaprop-ethyl. Em casa-de-vegetação, as cultivares de trigo 'BR- 38 ', 'E- 16 ', 'E- 49 ' e 'E- 52 ' apresentaram níveis aceitáveis de fitotoxicidade para fenoxaprop-ethyl a 90 g/ha, enquanto as demais cultivares ('BR- 23 ', 'BR- 35 ' e 'E- 40 ') apresentaram danos moderados ao herbicida. Já fenoxaprop-ethyl a 120 g/ha causou aumento no nível de fitotoxicidade para as cultivares de trigo, exceto para 'E- 16 ' e 'E- 52 '. O azevém mostrou-se tolerante ao herbicida fenoxaprop-ethyl. Conclui-se que existe potencial de uso do herbicida fenoxaprop-ethyl em lavouras de trigo para controlar seletivamente aveia-branca e aveia-preta.

The {{objective of}} this study was to investigate the tolerance levels of wheat and oat cultivars to the herbicide <b>diclofop-methyl,</b> fenoxaprop-ethyl and haloxyfop-methyl, aiming the selective use of these chemicals to control grass species that may infest these crops. Two experiments have been performed, one at field condition and another in the greenhouse. Treatments tested in the field were <b>diclofop-methyl</b> at 540 g/ha, fenoxaprop-ethyl at 180 g/ha, haloxyfop-methyl at 120 g/ha, plus a check without herbicide treatment, applied on Avena sativa cultivars 'CTC- 1 ', 'UFRGS- 7 ' and 'UPF- 16 ', and on Avena strigosa. In the greenhouse experiment, three rates of fenoxaprop-ethyl (0, 90 and 120 g/ha) have been tested, applied on seven wheat cultivars ('BR- 23 ', 'BR- 35 ', 'BR- 38 ', 'E- 16 ', 'E- 40 ', 'E- 49 ' and 'E- 52 '), on aots, Avena strigosa and ryegrass. As results of field trial, it was detected that all herbicides tested controlled efficiently (over 90 %) oat cultivars. Avena strigosa showed high sensitivity to fenoxaprop-ethyl and haloxyfop-methyl, and some tolerance to <b>diclofop-methyl,</b> whereas wheat showed tolerance to <b>diclofop-methyl</b> and fenoxaprop-ethyl. In the greenhouse, wheat cultivars 'BR- 38 ', 'E- 16 ', 'E- 49 ' and 'E- 52 ' presented cceptable levels of injury to fenoxaprop-ethyl at 90 g/ha, while the other cultivars ('BR- 23 ', 'BR- 35 ' and 'E- 52 ') presented moderate injury to the herbicide. On the other hand, fenoxaprop-methyl at 120 g/ha caused increased injury levels to all wheat cultivars, except 'E- 16 ' and 'E- 52 '. Ryegrass showed tolerance to fenoxaprop-ethyl. It was concluded that it is possible to use fenoxaprop-ethyl herbicide in wheat fields for selective controle of oats and A. strigosa. <b>Diclofop-methyl</b> presents high levels of oats control, but reduced control of A. strigosa.

Mecoprop ((+) - 2 -(4 -chloro- 2 -methylphenoxy) propanoic acid), difenzoquat (1, 2 - dimethyl- 3, 5 - diphenyl - 1 H- pyrazolium), dinoseb amine (amine salt of 2 -(1 -methylpropy 1) - 4, 6 -dinitrophenol), and diclofopmethyl (methyl ester of (+) - 2 -[4 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) phenoxy]propanoic acid) sometimes reduced the severity of take-all disease on the seminal and crown roots. The herbicides also reduced the incidence of 'whiteheads' associated with take-all injury. In additional evaluations, mecoprop, difenzoquat, and dinoseb did not affect severity of disease on the roots, but whiteheads again were reduced. <b>Diclofop-methyl</b> applied at 1. 12 kg ai/ha in early January often reduced the severity of take-all disease on seminal and crown roots. Higher rates of this herbicide, however, occasionally increased disease severity. The number of seminal roots produced by plants treated with <b>diclofop-methyl</b> often depended upon both application rate {{and the level of}} take-all stress. Crown root and tiller production were stimulated by <b>diclofop-methyl.</b> Low rates of difenzoquat, dinoseb, and mecoprop often increased tillering as well. The responses of the wheat plant to all four herbicides generally were greatest in plots with take-all disease. Fresh weights of individual tillers generally were reduced in response to herbicide application. Stimulations of tillering in diseased plots treated with <b>diclofop-methyl</b> progressively declined when applications were delayed after early January. Grain yields were greater in diseased plots treated with mecoprop, difenzoquat, and dinoseb than in the untreated check in 1982. Grain yield was either reduced or unaffected by diclofopmethyl, regardless of the level of take-all disease present. Herbicides did not affect grain yield in 1983. In vitro growth of three isolates of Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici was not inhibited by <b>diclofop-methyl</b> at concentrations below 10,uM.

40|$|Annual {{ryegrass}} (Lolium rigidum) biotype SLR 31 is {{resistant to}} the postemergent graminicide methyl- 2 -[4 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) phenoxy]-propanoate (<b>diclofop-methyl).</b> Uptake of [14 C](U-phenyl) <b>diclofop-methyl</b> and root/shoot distribution of radioactivity in susceptible and resistant plants were similar. In both biotypes, <b>diclofop-methyl</b> was rapidly demethylated to the biocidal metabolite diclofop acid which, in turn, was metabolized to ester and aryl-O-sugar conjugates. Susceptible plants accumulated 5 to 15 % more radioactivity in dicloflop acid than did resistant plants. Resistant plants had a slightly greater capacity to form nonbiocidal sugar conjugates. Despite these differences, resistant plants retained 20 % of 14 C in the biocidal metabolite diclofop acid 192 hours after treatment, whereas susceptible plants, which were close to death, retained 30 % in diclofop acid. The small differences in the pool sizes of the active and inactive metabolites are by themselves unlikely to account for a 30 -fold difference in sensitivity to the herbicide at the whole plant level. Similar high-pressure liquid chromatography elution patterns of conjugates from both susceptible and resistant biotypes indicated that the mechanisms and the products of catabolism in the biotypes are similar. It is suggested that metabolism of <b>diclofop-methyl</b> by the resistant biotype does not alone explain resistance observed at the whole-plant level. Diclofop acid reduced the electrochemical potential of membranes in etiolated coleoptiles of both biotypes; 50 % depolarization required 1 to 4 μm diclofop acid. After removal of diclofop acid, membranes from the resistant biotype recovered polarity, whereas membranes from the susceptible biotype did not. Internal concentrations of diclofop acid 4 h after exposing plants to herbicide were estimated to be 36 to 39 micromolar in a membrane fraction and 16 to 17 micromolar in a soluble fraction. Such concentrations should be sufficient to fully depolarize membranes. It is postulated that differences {{in the ability of}} membranes to recover from depolarization are correlated with the resistance response of biotype SLR 31...|$|E

In 2005, {{a random}} survey was {{conducted}} across 14 million hectares of the Western Australian grain belt to establish the frequency and distribution of herbicide-resistant wild oat (Avena spp.) in cropping fields. In total, 677 cropping fieldswere visited,withwild oat populations collected from 150 fields. Thesewild oat populationswere screenedwith several herbicides commonly used to control this weed. Most of the wild oat populations (71 %) were found to contain individuals resistant to the ACCase-inhibiting herbicide <b>diclofop-methyl.</b> Resistance to other ACCase-inhibiting herbicides was markedly lower. Herbicides of alternative modes of action were effective on all wild oat populations. Overall, wild oat resistance to <b>diclofop-methyl</b> {{was found to be}} widespread across the Western Australian grain belt, but resistance to other herbicides was relatively low. Therefore, through diversity in herbicide use and with cultural management, it is possible to maintain wild oat populations at a low level and/or minimise herbicide resistance evolution...|$|E
40|$|Lolium rigidum Gaud. biotype SLR 31 is {{resistant}} to the herbicide <b>diclofop-methyl</b> and cross-{{resistant to}} several sulfonylurea herbicides. Wheat and the cross-resistant ryegrass exhibit similar patterns of resistance to sulfonylurea herbicides, suggesting that the mechanism of resistance may be similar. Cross-resistant ryegrass is also {{resistant to the}} wheat-selective imidazolinone herbicide imazamethabenz. The cross-resistant biotype SLR 31 metabolized [phenyl-U- 14 C]chlorsulfuron {{at a faster rate}} than a biotype which is susceptible to both <b>diclofop-methyl</b> and chlorsulfuron. A third biotype which is resistant to <b>diclofop-methyl</b> but not to chlorsulfuron metabolized chlorsulfuron {{at the same rate as}} the susceptible biotype. The increased metabolism of chlorsulfuron observed in the cross-resistant biotype is, therefore, correlated with the patterns of resistance observed in these L. rigidum biotypes. During high performance liquid chromatography analysis the major metabolite of chlorsulfuron in both susceptible and cross-resistant ryegrass coeluted with the major metabolite produced in wheat. The major product is clearly different from the major product in the tolerant dicot species, flax (Linium usitatissimum). The elution pattern of metabolites of chlorsulfuron was the same for both the susceptible and cross-resistant ryegrass but the cross-resistant ryegrass metabolized chlorsulfuron more rapidly. The investigation of the dose response to sulfonylurea herbicides at the whole plant level and the study of the metabolism of chlorsulfuron provide two independent sets of data which both suggest that the resistance to chlorsulfuron in cross-resistant ryegrass biotype SLR 31 involves a wheat-like detoxification system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{genotoxic}} {{potential of the}} commercial herbicide Illoxan (containing 284 g/L <b>diclofop-methyl)</b> was determined by using chromosome aberrations in Allium cepa root tip cells. The EC 50 value was determined as 150. 00 mg/L using a root growth inhibition test and then the roots were treated with 37. 50, 75. 00, and 150. 00 mg/L concentrations for 12, 24, and 48 h. The results indicated that Illoxan significantly increased the abnormal cell frequency at all concentrations and treatment periods when compared with their controls, and this increase was dose-dependent for the 24 and 48 h treatments. On the other hand, Illoxan significantly decreased the mitotic index (MI) in all treatments when compared with their controls. The decrease in the mitotic index was slightly dose-dependent for the 24 and 48 h treatments. Illoxan {{did not affect the}} percentage of mitotic stages. For the pretreated root tips, Illoxan (except 37. 50 mg/L at 12 and 24 h) significantly increased the frequency of abnormal cells in a dose-dependent manner. This study indicates that Illoxan decreased the mitotic index and produced clastogenic and aneugenic types of abnormalities in Allium cepa root tip cells. The data obtained in this study showed that plant bioassays can be used as an important test battery to detect possible genotoxicity of chemicals.

40|$|The current {{mechanisms}} of herbicide selectivity in poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) {{were examined in}} glasshouse and field experiments. Through measurements of contact angles of diquat solutions it was established that poppy, and the weeds fumitory, fat hen and field poppy are 'hard' to wet, whilst shepherds purse, wild radish, spear thistle and curled dock are relatively 'easy' to wet. It was revealed that <b>diclofop-methyl</b> has properties characteristic of a weak surfactant, compared with Agral®, a finding supported through measurements of dynamic surface tension. The structure of the surface wax on the adaxial surface of poppy, field poppy, fumitory and fat hen leaves are described as seen under the scanning electron microscope. Chemical analysis of these waxes are also given. It appears the wax of fumitory and fat hen are influenced by application of ethofumesate. Chemical analysis shows that ethofumesate can inhibit the deposition of primary alcohols, long chain aldehydes and alkanes on the developing leaves of fumitory and fat hen, making these plants more susceptible than poppy plants to future applications of diquat + <b>diclofop-methyl.</b> Field trials conducted on the east and north-west of Tasmania, highlighted the difficulties that exist in extrapolating results from glasshouse experiments to field conditions. Measurements of spray retention and efficacy, revealed that plant responses to applications of diquat treatments were influenced, in addition to ethofumesate, by environmental conditions. Plant responses at both sites demonstrated that the inert ingredients of the commercial formulation of <b>diclofop-methyl,</b> would, in admixture with diquat produce the same result compared with the current diquat/diclofop-methyl treatmen...|$|E

Application of a 100 micromolar solution of <b>diclofop-methyl</b> to wheat coleoptiles {{had little or no}} effect on the membrane potential (EM), however in oat, EM slowly depolarized to the diffusion potential (ED). At pH 5. 7, 100 micromolar diclofop rapidly abolished the electrogenic component of the membrane potential in both oat and wheat coleoptiles with half-times of 5 to 10 minutes and 15 to 20 minutes, respectively. The concentrations giving half-maximal depolarizations in wheat were 20 to 30 micromolar compared to 10 to 20 micromolar in oat. The depolarizing response was not due to a general increase in membrane permeability as judged from the EM's response to changes in K+, Na+, Cl−, and SO 42 −, before and after treatment with diclofop and from its response to KCN treatment. In both plants, diclofop increased the membrane permeability to protons, making the EM strongly dependent upon the external pH in the range of pH 5. 5 to pH 8. 5. The effects of diclofop can best be explained by its action as a specific proton ionophore that shuttles protons across the plasmalemma. The rapidity of the cell's response to both <b>diclofop-methyl</b> (15 - 20 minutes) and diclofop (2 - 5 minutes) makes the ionophoric activity a likely candidate for the earliest herbicidal event exhibited by these compounds...|$|E
40|$|Weed control {{failures}} due to {{herbicide resistance}} are an increasing and worldwide problem significantly impacting crop yields. Herbicide resistance {{due to increased}} herbicide metabolism in weeds is not well characterized at the genetic level. An RNA-Seq transcriptome {{analysis was used to}} identify genes conferring metabolism-based herbicide resistance (MBHR) in a population (R) of a major global weed (Lolium rigidum), in which resistance to the herbicide <b>diclofop-methyl</b> was experimentally evolved through recurrent selection from a susceptible (S) progenitor population. A reference transcriptome of 19, 623 contigs was assembled using 454 sequencing technology on a cDNA library and annotated using UniProt and Pfam databases. Transcriptomic-level gene expression was measured using Illumina 100 bp reads from untreated control, mock, and <b>diclofop-methyl</b> treatments of R and S. Due to the established importance of cytochrome P 450 (CytP 450), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and glucosyltransferase (GT) genes in MBHR, 11 contigs with these annotations and higher constitutive expression in untreated R than in untreated S were selected as candidate genes for hypothesis testing, along with 17 additional differentially expressed contigs with annotations related to metabolism or signal transduction. In a forward genetics validation experiment, higher constitutive expression of nine contigs co-segregated with the resistance phenotype in an F 2 population, including 3 CytP 450, 3 GST, and 1 GT. At least nine genes with heritable increased constitutive expression are associated with MBHR trait. In a physiological validation experiment where 2, 4 -D pre-treatment induced <b>diclofop-methyl</b> protection in S individuals due to increased metabolism, seven of the nine genetically-validated contigs were significantly induced. These data help explain accumulation of resistance-endowing genes and rapid evolution of MBHR, and provide the opportunity to improve diagnostics of MBHR using molecular tools such as transcriptional markers...|$|E

40|$|Lolium perenne ssp. multiflorum (Italian ryegrass) {{resistant}} to ACCase inhibiting herbicides {{has been reported}} in many wheat producing counties across Arkansas. Resistance {{is believed to be the}} result of point mutations creating amino acid substitutions in the CT domain of the plastidic ACCase gene. This study explores the occurrence of mutations in the ACCase gene of ryegrass populations. Plant material was collected and DNA was extracted from 10 Arkansas ryegrass populations. Six of the populations were known to be {{resistant to}} the ACCase inhibitor <b>diclofop-methyl,</b> while the remaining four populations were known to be susceptible to <b>diclofop-methyl.</b> Two highly conserved regions of the plastidic ACCase gene known to contain mutations that confer resistance to ACCase inhibiting herbicides were then amplified and sequenced. Analysis of the sequences revealed that only 41 % of the resistant populations expressed a mutation known to confer resistance. Several resistant populations of ryegrass did not contain any of the known mutations in their plastidic ACCase gene. This result means that either a mutation in a different region of the CT domain affects the affinity to ACCase inhibiting herbicides or the plants harbor a different mechanism of resistance. Further, in some resistant populations, not all plants within that population possessed a mutation known to cause resistance to ACCase inhibitors. This suggests that within a population, multiple mechanisms of resistance may exist. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism of resistance in diclofop-resistant plants that do not harbor mutations in the tested ACCase herbicide-binding domains...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In 2003, {{a random}} survey was {{conducted}} across the Western Australian wheatbelt to establish the frequency and distribution of herbicide resistance in ryegrass populations infesting crop fields. Five hundred cropping fields were visited at crop maturity, and ryegrass seed was collected in 452 of these fields. Subsequently, each crop field population was screened with herbicides of various modes of action that are commonly used for ryegrass control in Australian cropping systems. Most of these ryegrass populations {{were found to be}} resistant to the ACCase-inhibitor herbicide <b>diclofop-methyl</b> (68 %) and the ALS-inhibitor herbicide sulfometuron (88 %). A comparison of resistance levels in the same agronomic zones surveyed 5 years earlier determined that there had been an increase of 20 percentage points in the frequency of resistance over this 5 -year period. This survey also determined that the majority (64 %) of populations were found to be multiple resistant to both <b>diclofop-methyl</b> and sulfometuron. The distribution patterns of the collected populations indicated that there were higher frequencies of resistant and developing resistance populations occurring in the intensively cropped regions of the wheatbelt, which had greater herbicide selection pressure. Of concern is that 24 % and 8 % of populations were found to be developing resistance to trifluralin and clethodim, respectively. Currently these herbicides are heavily relied upon for control of ACCase and ALS herbicide resistant ryegrass. Nearly all populations remain susceptible to glyphosate.

Electrophoresis confirmed the great range of variation detected by preliminary morphological analysis. Approximately half the individuals in each population could be classified as belonging to Lolium multiflorum or Lolium rigidum, the most common Lolium species present in the area. However, electrophoretic patterns revealed a significant number (40 – 60 %) of hybrid individuals in all populations. The origin of these off-types was postulated as resulting from both intrageneric hybridization among different Lolium species and intergeneric hybridization between Lolium and Festuca genera.

Greater than 75 % of the applied <b>diclofop-methyl</b> hydrolyzed to diclofop in 2 days at 4 °C, the prevailing soil temperature during western Oregon winters. Degradation beyond the diclofop molecule, also an active herbicide, was much slower {{with a half}} life of 42 days. Microbial activity was identified as the primary mechanism in both the hydrolysis and degradation processes. Diclofop residues were detected in the 1 - 5 and 5 - 10 cm depths, indicating that leaching had occurred. Runoff losses of diclofop [2 -(4 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) phenoxy) propionic acid] were also measured following January applications to small (6. 0 and 1. 4 ha) agricultural watersheds in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. Diclofop runoff losses were higher in 1980 (7. 1 and 3. 9 % of the applied herbicide at the 6. 0 and 1. 4 ha watersheds, respectively) than in 1981 (0. 7 and < 0. 1 %, respectively). In 1980, between 80 and 90 % of the diclofop seasonal loss was partitioned into the aqueous phase of runoff. The maximum diclofop concentrations in runoff were 370 and 790 mg/m³ at the 6. 0 and 1. 4 ha watersheds, respectively. Larger diclofop losses in 1980 were attributed to (1) the close proximity of large runoff events to the application date and (2) the high antecedent soil moisture status prior to the first runoff event {{which resulted in a}} high percentage runoff. The presence of a soil surface crust limited the depth to which overland flow extracted diclofop residues from the soil profile and resulted in very shallow calculated mixing depths (0. 13 - 0. 16 cm). A subsurface drainage system installed at the 1. 4 ha watershed effectively lowered antecedent soil moisture as compared to the 6. 0 ha watershed. Consequently, percentage runoff and diclofop runoff losses were reduced at the 1. 4 ha watershed. Diclofop losses in the subsurface drainage effluent accounted for 1. 2 and < 0. 1 % of the applied herbicide in 1980 and 1981, respectively.
