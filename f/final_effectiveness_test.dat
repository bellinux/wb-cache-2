40|$|Abstract. According to IAS 39 or FAS 133 an a posteriori <b>test</b> for hedge <b>effectiveness</b> {{has to be}} {{implemented}} when using hedge accounting.

Such tests are of different quality, for example {{not all of them}} can deal with the problem of small numbers. This means a test might determine an effective hedge to be ineffective, a scenario which would increase the volatility in earnings.

Two Invacare-A 4 and one Invacare-TopEnd successfully completed the double drum and curb drop tests, but the remaining 9 wheelchairs failed prematurely. No significant differences were found in the number of the equivalent cycles or the value among the four models.

Materials and Methods: Artificial tear, atropine sulfate, betamethasone, homatropine hydrobromide, phenylephrine hydrochloride, phenylephrine zinc, pilocarpine hydrochloride, tetracaine hydrochloride and tropicamide eye-drops were subjected to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and British Pharmacopeia (BP) antimicrobial preservative <b>effectiveness</b> <b>tests.</b> Results: The results of this study showed that eight out of the nine products met the BP 'B' and USP criteria. The preservative employed in phenylephrine zinc eye-drop did not possess adequate antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa. Other eye-drops showed appropriate reductions in bacterial viability after 6 hrs, 24 hrs and 7 days, but showed a very low bacterial recovery after 28 days which didn't comply with the no recovery (NR) term of BP 'A' criteria. Since viable microbial counts were usually determined by plate count method, it seems that the term of NR should define an acceptable range.
