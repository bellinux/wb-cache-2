40|$|Abstract â€“ A {{multi-layer}} {{plastic packaging}} {{technology has been}} developed for microfluidic systems containing electrical and mechanical functionality. Hot embossing and <b>heat</b> <b>staking</b> of plastics, micro stenciling of electrodes, and stereolithography (SLA) was combined with conventional MEMS fabrication techniques to realize the system. The approach allows for multiple materials of fabrication, provides a solution to integration of electrical functionality throughout the system, and provides an interconnect technology for interfacing fluids and electrical components between the macro and the micro worlds...|$|R

The first race was won by 'Symbol' but the feature events of the evening were the Berkshire <b>Stakes</b> <b>heats</b> and Tilehurst hurdles <b>stakes</b> <b>heats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thermoplastic staking, {{also known}} as <b>heat</b> <b>staking,</b> is the same process except that it uses heat to deform the plastic boss, instead of cold forming. A plastic stud {{protruding}} from one component fits into {{a hole in the}} second component. The stud is then deformed through the softening of the plastic to form a head which mechanically locks the two components together. It is a versatile technique benefiting from being quick, economical and consistent. Unlike welding techniques, staking has the capacity to join plastics to other materials (e.g. metal, PCB's) in addition to joining like or dissimilar plastics, and it has the advantage over other mechanical joining methods in eliminating the need for consumables such as rivets and screws.|$|R

50|$|As recounted by Homer, the cyclops Polyphemus, who has trapped Odysseus and {{his crew}} in his cave home with a huge stone and begun to eat them, has been made drunk and fallen asleep. Odysseus cannot kill him as {{he would not be}} able to move the stone, so he heats the tip of a stake of olive wood in the cave in the fire and with that blinds the giant's only eye. The next day he and his men escape by {{clinging}} underneath Polyphemus' sheep as he lets them out to graze, feeling only their backs. The moment shown is when the <b>heated</b> <b>stake</b> is being raised into position, and at right one of the companions carrying the wine-skin creeps away trying not to wake the giant; this is perhaps the most complete of the original figures.|$|R
50|$|Heat sealing is {{the process}} of sealing one {{thermoplastic}} to another similar thermoplastic using heat and pressure. The direct contact method of heat sealing utilizes a constantly heated die or sealing bar to apply heat to a specific contact area or path to seal or weld the thermoplastics together. Heat sealing is used for many applications, including heat seal connectors, thermally activated adhesives and film or foil sealing.Common applications for the heat sealing process: Heat seal connectors are used to join LCDs to PCBs in many consumer electronics, as well as in medical and telecommunication devices. Heat sealing of products with thermal adhesives is used to hold clear display screens onto consumer electronic products and for other sealed thermo-plastic assemblies or devices where <b>heat</b> <b>staking</b> or ultrasonic welding is not an option due to part design requirements or other assembly considerations. Heat sealing also is used in the manufacturing of bloodtest film and filter media for the blood, virus and many other test strip devices used in the medical field today. Laminate foils and films often are heat sealed over the top of thermoplastic medical trays, Microtiter (microwell) plates, bottles and containers to seal and/or prevent contamination for medical test devices, sample collection trays and containers used for food products. Medical and the Food Industries manufacturing Bag or flexible containers use heat sealing for either perimeter welding of the plastic material of the bags and/or for sealing ports and tubes into the bags.A variety of heat sealers are available to join thermoplastic materials such as plastic films: Hot bar sealer, Impulse sealer, etc.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} design, fabrication, {{and testing of}} a microfluidic system {{to be used for}} whole-cell analysis. The study of cellular function and structure is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment. Microsystems developed to perform these bioanalyses add benefits such as requiring smaller samples and reagents, testing multiple samples in parallel, and supporting point-of-care testing, all of which increases throughput and reduces cost-per-analysis. Traditional methods for designing a microsystem use standard materials and techniques such as silicon, glass, photolithography, and wet and dry etching. This research is focused on utilizing materials and techniques that require less infrastructure, allow for a faster design-to-prototype cycle, and can integrate electrical and fluidic functionality to address a variety of possible applications. The microfluidic system presented in this thesis is comprised of multiple layers of Kapton, a polyimide available from DuPont. Kapton provides a biocompatible substrate that is flexible while maintaining structural stability and can be used in high temperature and other harsh environments. Microchannels with widths of 400 m and thru-hole fluidic vias less than 5 m in diameter are laser ablated through the flexible polyimide sheets using excimer and CO 2 lasers. Electrical traces and contact pads are defined on the substrate by vapor deposition through reusable microstencils rather than with photolithography. The patterned layers are bonded using <b>heat</b> <b>staking</b> and then packaged with the addition of wires and a fluidic interface. Validation of the system for whole-cell analysis was first performed with impedance spectroscopy measurements collected on air, DI water, phosphate buffered saline, clusters of human cancer cells, and human cancer tissue samples. This was followed by testing the ability to use the device to control the movement and position of 10 m diameter microbeads and dissociated cells. As a whole, this research demonstrates the realization of a microfluidic system for whole-cell analysis based on non-standard fabrication materials and techniques. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Frazier, A.
