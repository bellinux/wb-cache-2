40|$|The {{successful}} {{management of}} large herbivores requires the monitoring {{of a set}} of indicators of ecological change describing animal performance, relative animal abundance, and ungulate impact on habitat. Wild boar populations increases have been spectacular in many countries including France. Wild boars can have a substantial environmental impact on many ecosystem components including birds, but indicators to monitor such impact are currently lacking. In this paper, we examined the usefulness of monitoring the wild boar foraging traces made during their rooting activity to evaluate their impact on ground nesting birds, and developed a simple indicator of kilometric foraging (Ikf) traces found on transects. This study measured the effect of wild boar on bird abundances, controlling for vegetation characteristics (shrub density, time since last clear-cut). Using standardized spot-counts, we found that <b>ground</b> <b>nesting</b> <b>bird</b> abundances were negatively correlated to IkF. Our results showed a significant decrease of 44, 7 % in <b>ground</b> <b>nesting</b> <b>bird</b> abundances in areas strongly foraged by wild boars. By contrast, abundances of birds depending of ground or tree for food resource, but nesting out of reach of wild boars, were not correlated to foraging traces. We thus conclude that IkF is a simple and suitable indicator that can be used at large scales to monitor wild boar impact on ground nesting birds...|$|E

Anthropogenic landscape changes often alter these processes due to qualitative and quantitative changes in the predator comunity. This thesis contains four papers that are focused on {{various aspects of the}} nest predation, antipredation strategies and distribution of predators in the landscape modified by human activities. The first contribution "Nest protection in mallards (Anas plathyrhynchos) : Untangling the role of crypsis and parental behaviour" (Kreisinger & Albrecht 2008) focus on the effect of antipredation strategies on the reproductive success in a <b>ground</b> <b>nesting</b> <b>bird,</b> mallard. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that multiple antipredation strategies including nest site selection parental antipredation behavior and crypsis due to clutch concealment by the nest material during incubation recesses reduce sumultaniousely the risk of the clutch predation in birds.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, high-efficiency farming {{equipment}} {{has been developed}} in the agricultural sector. This has also included efficiency improvement of moving techniques, which include increased working speeds and widths. Therefore, the risk of wild animals being accidentally injured or killed during routine farming operations has increased dramatically over the years. In particular, the nests of <b>ground</b> <b>nesting</b> <b>bird</b> species like grey partridge (Perdix perdix) or pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) are vulnerable to farming operations in their breeding habitat, whereas in mammals, the natural instinct of e. g., leverets of brown hare (Lepus europaeus) and fawns of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) to lay low and still in the vegetation to avoid predators increase their risk of being killed or injured in farming operations. Various methods and approaches {{have been used to}} reduce wildlife mortality resulting from farming operations. However, since wildlife-friendly farming often results in lower efficiency, {{attempts have been made to}} develop automatic systems capable of detecting wild animals in the crop. Here we assessed the suitability of thermal imaging in combination with digital image processing to automatically detect a chicken (Gallus domesticus) and a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in a grassland habitat. Throughout the different test scenarios, our study animals were detected with a high precision, although the most dense grass cover reduced the detection rate. We conclude that thermal imaging and digital imaging processing may be an important tool for the improvement of wildlife-friendly farming practices in the future...|$|E
40|$|The genomic era {{offer an}} {{exciting}} opportunity to establish biodiversity assessment for plants and animals. More specifically, DNA metabarcoding {{can be used}} as a proxy for the biodiversity existing in a sample (soil, water, faeces, [...] ) and therefore it represents a powerful and a non invasive tool to answer concerns regarding ecological questions (conservation, restoration). To illustrate such prospect, we conducted a study on the expanding wild boar populations in the Spanish Pyrenees. Over the last decades, the populations of wild boar are growing in the Iberian peninsula mainly due to their high adaptability to new environments, new climates, varied diets and high reproduction rates. Despite the economic interest of the species in the Peninsula, this expansion cause many damage on ecosystems, humans and farming practices. By moving higher in altitude, it has been suggested that the wild boar populations might be responsible for the rapid decline of the endangered capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) populations in the Pyrenees. By searching for food, they come accross the <b>ground</b> <b>nesting</b> <b>bird</b> nest and gobble the eggs. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the diet of the wild boar populations in higher altitude in the Spanish Pyrenees. 81 faecal samples collected during summer and autumn 2014 in the Aigues Tortes National Park have been extracted, amplified and sequenced using the Illumina Technology. With this method, a precise estimation of the animal prey existing in the wild boar faeces was possible and will eventually allow wild life managers to apply concrete management measures for this expanding species.

40|$|Populations {{with small}} {{effective}} sizes {{are at risk}} for inbreeding depression and loss of adaptive potential. Variance in reproductive success is one of several factors reducing effective population size (Ne) below the actual population size (N). Here, we investigate the effects of polygynous (skewed) mating and variation in female breeding success on the effective size of a small population of the Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus), a <b>ground</b> <b>nesting</b> <b>bird</b> with a lek mating system. During a two-year field study, we recorded attendance of marked birds at leks, male mating success, the reproductive success of radio-tagged females, and annual survival. We developed simulations to estimate the distribution of male reproductive success. Using these data, we estimated population size (N^) and effective population size Ne for the study population. We also simulated the effects of population size, skewed vs. random mating, and female breeding failure on Ne. In our study population, the standardized variance in seasonal reproductive success was almost as high in females as in males, primarily due to a high rate of nest failure (73 %). Estimated Ne (42) was 19 % of N^ in our population, below the level at which inbreeding depression is observed in captive breeding studies. A high hatching failure rate (28 %) was also consistent with ongoing inbreeding depression. In the simulations, Ne was reduced by skewed male mating success, especially at larger population sizes, and by female breeding failure. Extrapolation of our results suggests that six of the seven extant populations of this species may have effective sizes low enough to induce inbreeding depression and hence that translocations may be needed to supplement genetic diversity...|$|E

40|$|CHRISTOPHER R. BOTTOM, for the MASTER OF SCIENCE {{degree in}} ZOOLOGY, {{presented}} on XXXX at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: HABITAT OVERLAP AMONG MESOCARNIVORES AND WILD TURKEYS IN AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE MAJOR PROFESSOR: Clayton K. Nielsen Wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) populations have grown considerably {{in the agricultural}} Midwest {{during the past few}} decades, as have mesocarnivores such as coyotes (Canis latrans) and bobcats (Lunx rufus) which may impact turkey populations. However, few studies have assessed habitat overlap between mesocarnivores and turkeys with a goal to understand potential impacts of mesocarnivores on turkeys. To address these gaps in the literature, my objectives were to (1) create single-species models of habitat use for bobcats, coyotes, and wild turkeys; (2) model habitat overlap among species; and (3) determine the influence of mesocarnivore habitat use on wild turkey nest success and mortality. I captured and radiomarked 14 adult bobcats (10 M, 4 F), 19 adult coyotes (11 M, 8 F), and 44 wild turkey hens (9 J, 34 A) during 2011 - 2013 in a complex agricultural landscape in southern Illinois. I developed single-species resource selection function models of habitat use for all 3 focal species and also developed habitat overlap models. In the single species models, wild turkey and bobcat use was concentrated largely in forested areas whereas coyote use was highest in agricultural areas. Overlap among species was common and occurred mostly in forested areas. I then used locations of 107 wild turkeys nests and 28 hen mortalities and modeled the effect of bobcat, coyote, and wild turkey use on turkey nest success and mortalities. Coyote presence was the best predictor of nest success, with increased coyote use associated with higher nest success. Wild turkey use was important in determining location of wild turkey hen mortalities, with increased turkey use associated with higher probability of mortality occurrence. My findings suggest that top predators may be important and beneficial for ground nesting avian species (e. g., wild turkey). Coyotes utilize many habitat types for foraging including forest edges, grasslands, and wetlands. These are abundant in a fragmented landscapes and also represent areas preferred by <b>ground</b> <b>nesting</b> <b>bird</b> species and other mesocarnivores. With coyotes acting as the top predator throughout much of the Midwest, they are likely reducing densities of other important turkey nest predator species, thereby increasing nest success. Although the study is not conclusive on its own, it is consistent with the predictions of the mesopredator release hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|Predation {{is known}} {{to be one of the}} most {{important}} causes of <b>nest</b> failure in <b>ground</b> <b>nesting</b> <b>birds,</b> and many populations are experiencing a decline in breeding success worldwide. Predator abundance are expected to be highest closer to productive areas (i. e. Ecosystem exploitation hypothesis), and vary according to the availability of other prey (i. e. Alternative prey hypothesis). I hypothesized that ground-nesting birds can escape predation by breeding in less productive habitats, and that predation rates will vary according to small rodent abundances. To test these hypotheses artificial nests were deployed in nine study areas in Finnmark, northern Norway, over a four-year period along replicated distance-gradients from the forest border and into tundra plateaus (n= 180 * 4 years). Predation rates varied annually according to small rodent abundances in support of the alternative prey hypothesis. Highest predation rates were found on nests placed furthest away from the forest border, and are therefore not in support of my productivity hypothesis. <b>Ground</b> <b>nesting</b> <b>birds</b> that breed on the tundra experience higher predation pressure than birds breeding in more productive habitats (e. g. forests), which might be a result of higher visibility of nests, and responses to the abundance of main prey or subsidies in nest predators...|$|R
