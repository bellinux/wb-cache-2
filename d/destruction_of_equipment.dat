Some special priorities were also established; farmers were to be given priority for motor vehicles, machine tools were to be allocated to ex-servicemen and training colleges and special consideration was to be given to the needs of the Red Cross and other overseas and domestic charitable associations.|$|E

Toward this goal, a computer controlled system has been developed and built for interlocking tests run on elevated temperature mechanical test facilities.

The system is designed {{to work with the}} default interlocks present in the RF generators and mechanical tests systems. Digital hardware consists of two National Instruments 1 / 0 boards mounted in a Macintosh IIci computer. Software is written in National Instruments LabVIEW. Systems interlocked include two MTS closed loop servo controlled hydraulic test frames, one with an RF generator and one with both an RF generator and a quartz lamp furnace. Control for individual test systems is modularized making the addition of more systems simple. If any of the supporting utilities fail during tests, heating systems, chill water and hydraulics are powered down, minimizing specimen damage and eliminating equipment damage. The interlock control is powered by an uninterruptible power supply. Upon failure the cause is documented in an ASCII file...|$|E

Implementation of an adequate fault detection system represents an important step towards early detection of such faults, thus {{reducing the risk of}} unexpected failures. Traditionally, fault detection process is done by comparing the observed machine state with a set of historical data representing the fault [...] free state. However, such historical data are rarely available. In such cases, the fault detection process is performed by examining whether a particular pre [...] modeled fault signature can be matched within the signals acquired from the monitored machine. In this paper we propuse a solution to a problem of fault detection without any prior data, presented at PHM' 09 Data Challenge. The solution is based on a two step algorithm. The first step, based on the spectral kurtosis method, is used to determine whether a particular experimental run is likely to contain a faulty element. In case of a positive decision, fault isolation procedure is applied as the second step. The fault isolation procedure was based on envelope analysis of filtered vibration signals. The filtering of the vibration signals was performed in the frequency band that maximizes the spectral kurtosis. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was evaluated for bearing fault detection, on the vibration data obtained from the PHM' 09 Data Challenge...|$|E
