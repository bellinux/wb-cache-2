25|$|The {{earliest}} test models used screens only a {{few inches}} across and had the guns arranged almost at right angles to it, making for a very large tube. Later models were built inside very large Hackbridge-Hewittic (H-H) vacuum tubes, which the company originally designed for use as high-power rectifiers in power supplies. Arthur Johnson, a <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> who had previously worked for both Baird and H-H, produced the new models. These had screens ten inches across, comparable to monochrome screens of the era. The guns fired upward at about a 45 degree angle. As in the teapot tube, the necks were very long.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Thomas Edison began {{investigating}} materials for ability to fluoresce when X-rayed, {{and by the}} turn of the century he had invented a fluoroscope with sufficient image intensity to be commercialized. Edison had quickly discovered that calcium tungstate screens produced brighter images. Edison, however, abandoned his researches in 1903 because of the health hazards that accompanied use of these early devices. Clarence Dally, a <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> of lab equipment and tubes at Edison’s laboratory was repeatedly exposed, suffering radiation poisoning, later succumbing to an aggressive cancer. Edison himself damaged an eye in testing these early fluoroscopes.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} step of the glass-making process, molten glass was {{extracted}} from the pot or tank. The <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> and his helper used a blowpipe, which was typically [...] to [...] long, to create a bubble of molten glass.

500|$|The {{window glass}} {{manufacturing}} process used by Hartford City Glass {{was known as}} the Cylinder Method. [...] The process was labor-intensive, and required the services of a <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> and glass cutter—who were both highly skilled and well paid. The <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> led a small production crew that included skilled and unskilled workers. At older plants, the glass blower's workstation was adjacent to a ceramic pot located inside the furnace. Each pot contained molten glass created by melting a batch of ingredients that included sand, soda, and lime. [...] At newer plants such as the Hartford City works, tanks were used instead of pots. The tanks were essentially huge brick pots with multiple workstations. A tank furnace is more efficient than a pot furnace, but more costly to build.|$|E

50|$|On the {{recommendation}} of Frank Thrower, a potter and amateur glassware designer, the trust recruited Eskil Vilhemson, a Swedish glass manufacturer, to be the company's Managing Director. A team of Scandinavian <b>glass</b> <b>blowers</b> came with him to Torrington, {{some of whom are}} still there to this day, and the factory opened in June 1967 under the name of Dartington Glass. A year later in 1969 more <b>glass</b> <b>blowers</b> followed, one Italian and a couple from Denmark.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>blowers</b> faced a major {{challenge}} in the 1880s from a new union, the American Flint Glass Workers' Union of North America (AFGWU). Flint glass, commonly known as [...] "crystal", was made in closed pots to protect the glass from impurities (unlike green glass), and generally the flint glass workforce was more highly skilled. The AFGWU formed in Pittsburgh in 1878, and within four short years had locals throughout West Virginia and Ohio and was spreading east. Feeling threatened by the new union, the <b>Glass</b> <b>Blowers</b> waged several bitter jurisdictional strikes against the AFGWU in the 1880s and 1890s. The union's jurisdictional fight was an important one. Highly skilled workers like <b>glass</b> <b>blowers</b> made up 15 {{percent of the entire}} workforce. While 45 percent of American workers made just enough money in the 1880s to be at or above the poverty line ($500 a year), another 30 percent made less than that. A shocking 10 percent of all full-time workers made so little money they were considered absolutely destitute. <b>Glass</b> <b>blowers,</b> however, made 60 to 100 percent more than the average worker, and were considered the [...] "cream" [...] of the working class.|$|R
500|$|The glass {{blowing machine}} used by American Window Glass {{factories}} {{was created by}} Pittsburgh resident John H. Lubbers, and he continued to contribute improvements to the machine over the next decade. [...] By using the Lubbers machine, human glass blowers were replaced with a machine operator paid 30 percent of the <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> wage. The machine was also five times more productive than the human blowers. It could make windows four times as large because a larger cylinder was extracted from the tank of molten glass. [...] Thus, the highest–paid skilled workers in the United States were considered obsolete. In the case of Hartford City, machines replaced most of the human glass blowers by 1908.|$|E
500|$|After the acquisition, the Hartford City Glass works {{became known}} as plant number 3 of the American Window Glass Company. The plant {{employed}} 450 people in 1901. [...] As natural gas supplies in Indiana became depleted, many manufacturers moved or did not survive. [...] The major plants of the American Window Glass successfully changed energy sources from natural gas to gas made from coal. [...] The company also had a technological advantage. Instead of using a <b>glass</b> <b>blower,</b> American Window Glass plants extracted molten glass with a machine. The machine, which was not immediately utilized at all American Window Glass plants, {{was known as the}} Lubbers blowing machine. Refinements to the machine and glass-making process were made at the Hartford City works by plant manager Harry G. Slingluff. Production records for the entire company were set at the Hartford City plant in 1905 and 1907—using the Lubbers machines.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1962 Littleton once again {{traveled}} to Europe, this time to research how glass was taught in universities there. He found nothing that he could bring back to the U.S. to help him educate art students at the University of Wisconsin. At that time, European glass programs were geared solely toward industrial production. Students were not taught hands-on techniques with the material; the craft of working with hot glass was still taught at the factories, under the apprenticeship system. What Littleton did find in Europe was a kindred spirit in glass art, the German Erwin Eisch, who is recognized today as a founder of European studio glass. [...] Eisch {{had set up a}} small work area in his family’s glass factory in Frauenau for the production of his own glass art. [...] Trained as a fine artist in the academies of Germany, he was largely self-taught as a <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> and at the time produced his work {{with the help of the}} factory’s craftsmen. The friendship begun when Littleton visited Eisch in Frauenau in 1962 lasted for the rest of Littleton’s life, and had profound influence on the work of each. [...] The two spent some of almost every summer together for the next thirty years.|$|E

Of course, {{any kind}} of work in glass, or in metal, on a large scale, {{involves}} some painful endurance of heat; and working in clay, some habitual endurance of cold; but the point beyond which the effort must not be carried is marked by loss of power of manipulation. As long as the eyes and fingers have complete command of the material (as a <b>glass</b> <b>blower</b> has, for instance, in doing fine ornamental work)--the law is not violated; but all our great engine and furnace work, in gun-making and the like, is degrading to the intellect; and no nation can long persist in it without losing many of its human faculties. Nay, even the use of machinery, other than the common rope and pully, for the lifting of weights, is degrading to architecture; the invention of expedients for the raising of enormous stones {{has always been a}} characteristic of partly savage or corrupted races. A block of marble not larger than a cart with a couple of oxen could carry, and a cross-beam, with a couple of pulleys, raise, is as large as should generally be used in any building. The employment of large masses is sure to lead to vulgar exhibitions of geometrical arrangement,[127] and to draw away the attention from the sculpture. In general, rocks naturally break into such pieces as the human beings that have to build with them can easily lift, and no larger should be sought for.|$|E
