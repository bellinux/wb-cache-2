40|$|The Government of Indonesia is {{committed}} to cut its emissions by 26 % by 2020. In the forestry sector, this is done through reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) program. One of several pilot activities of the REDD Program is the Berau Forest Carbon Program (BFCP) which {{is located in the}} Berau District East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The Program attempts to generate behavioural changes of the forests stakeholders like <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>community,</b> forestry/logging company and oil palm plantation company to contribute to the emissions reduction, which is formulated in the Program?s strategies. Changes of these behaviours are reflected in the costs being borne by the relevant forest stakeholders as well as the incentive ewarded for engaging in the programme. This paper focuses on the dataset preparation i. e. the Berau District Social Accounting Matrix for CGE modeling analysis of the above context. A non survey method was employed to generate the regional accounts and was it combined with available data as well as experts' estimates...|$|E
40|$|The Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (FLEG) II European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) East Countries Programme (ENPI FLEG Program) {{supports}} participating countries’ forest governance. At {{the regional}} level, the Programme, {{funded by the}} European Union and implemented by the World Bank, International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and World Wide Fund for Nature, aims to implement the 2005 St. Petersburg FLEG Ministerial Declaration and support countries to commit to a time-bound action plan. At the national level the Programme reviews or revises forest sector policies and legal and administrative structures. It also aims to improve knowledge of and support for sustainable forest management and good forest governance in participating countries. At the sub-national (local) level, the Programme tests and demonstrates best practices for sustainable forest management and the feasibility of improved forest governance practices at the field-level on a pilot basis. The ENPI FLEG Program is an innovative approach that was developed in response to illegal forest activities in Eastern Europe and Russia. With respect to the participating countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and Russia, the ENPI FLEG program seeks to establish sustainable forest governance practices and improve rural <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>community</b> livelihoods by working with governments and civil society. This report focuses on the IUCN activities in the ENPI FLEG Program (IUCN-FLEG). Through interviews with IUCN-FLEG program staff and country coordinators, nine notable activities were documented and analyzed {{in order to identify}} key factors facilitating activity effectiveness, common challenges encountered, and major lessons to be learned. Key facilitating factors included IUCN-FLEG’s professional reputation and network, the program’s adaptability to the local context, and the program’s structure and culture that encouraged learning and adaptation. Some common challenges were community distrust of outsiders, uncertainty due to government reforms, changes in institutional culture, and financial and human capacity limitations of governments in the region. Several lessons were drawn from the analysis of IUCN-FLEG activities. For instance, the IUCN-FLEG was effective at implementing its activities by adopting a facilitative role within existing institutional processes and adapting to the institutional and socio-political context in which they were operating. Similarly, sustainable forest governance in the program’s participating countries was fostered by connecting with likeminded and committed professionals on the ground. Finally, the IUCN-FLEG program’s ability to create synergies with governments, NGOs and citizens involved in forestry sectors in Eastern Europe and Russia allowed them to have a consequential impact in the region despite the program’s modest size...|$|E

40|$|A common, often unstated, {{assumption}} in {{the wide}} ranging literature advocating co-management approaches to management of forestry, and related natural resources, in developing countries is that co-management {{has the potential to}} improve the livelihood outcomes of <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities.</b> Consequently, co-management has gained wide acceptance among governments, development agencies and development practitioners as an alternative natural resources management strategy to the top-down or centralised government management approaches. However, many natural resource management scholars have conceptually narrowly focused their research, informed either by the literature on institutional design and evaluation or by the literature on livelihood outcomes per se, without explicitly acknowledging and rigorously examining possible linkages between the two. Thus, a major gap in the current literature on the evaluation of co-management institutional arrangements {{is the extent to which}} co-management can strengthen the livelihoods of the poor <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities.</b> This gap is addressed in this thesis by developing and testing an argument that well designed co-management arrangements have the potential to strengthen the livelihood outcomes of <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities.</b> A hybrid analytical framework was developed that situates the design criteria for co-management institutions in the broader context of the sustainable livelihood framework. It then uses this analytical framework to evaluate the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest Reserve (ASFR) co-management initiative in Kenya, based on a three-step process. First, the thesis provides an overview of current institutional arrangements for governance of the ASFR co-management regime. Second, it evaluates the extent to which these governance arrangements can be characterised as devolved collaborative governance, informed by Ostrom’s (1990) design principles and; third, it evaluates the extent to which the livelihood outcomes of <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities</b> which are formally participants in the co-management project, compared to adjacent <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities</b> outside the ambit of the co-management arrangement, have strengthened as a result of the ASFR co-management governance arrangements. The findings from this study demonstrate that institutional arrangements for ASFR co-management are relatively nascent and emerging because the governance arrangements for the ASFR co-management project cannot yet be characterised as fully devolved collaborative governance. Notwithstanding this, the findings reveal that participant <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities</b> in the co-management project had stronger livelihoods compared to <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities</b> not within the co-management scheme. Thus, the exploratory hypothesis is partially verified with qualifications. A key theoretical significance of the study is that it has conceptually and methodologically forged a link between the co-management discourse and the sustainable development discourse. Based on the study findings, an on-going evaluation of the ASFR co-management initiative is recommended to improve its future sustainability and that of the livelihoods of the communities that depend on it...|$|R
30|$|The {{world is}} {{grappling}} with {{a myriad of}} problems, including deepening poverty situations in many countries; especially the <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities.</b> These communities are mostly located in remote areas {{where most of the}} services and provisions are limited. Consequently, these communities find themselves heavily reliant on the natural resources within their proximity oftentimes. Therefore, forest resources, particularly the non-timber forest products (NTFPs) have been established as an essential source of livelihood for the majority of <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities</b> among others. This study aimed at assessing the forest-people relationship in terms of the contributions of NTFPs to household’s livelihoods and incomes; an important parameter that may guide policy formulation, practice, and management.|$|R
40|$|The Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation program, or REDD+, {{has been}} the {{international}} community’s first real {{attempt to create a}} global forest governance system which would impact countries on national, regional and even local scales. This paper provides an in-depth analysis on the impact of REDD+ on <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities.</b> The dimensions which are included in this review are institutions and governance, livelihoods, socio-cultural aspects, and the environment. Many studies confirm that <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities</b> are not sufficiently involved in current REDD+ projects. Furthermore, current and potential impacts of REDD+ on communities often disrupt local peoples’ livelihoods and strategies, institutions and socio-cultural systems in various ways, such as unequal benefit sharing, food insecurity, introduction of new powerful stakeholders, illegal land acquisition, unfair free prior and informed consent, and the introduction of monoculture plantations. REDD+ is also perceived as a neoliberal mechanism which renegotiates peoples’ relationship with the natural environment by monetizing nature. The paper concludes with a framework which addresses the potential drivers and threats of REDD+ concerning <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities</b> based on the literature review. This framework suggests a holistic approach to REDD+ implementation, which incorporates forest-dependent communities’ often complex relationship with the natural environment, such as incorporation of traditional forest management systems and provision of viable alternatives to loss of agricultural land...|$|R

40|$|Proposals for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) {{that are}} gaining {{prominence}} in international climate change negotiations offer both {{risks and opportunities}} for members of <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities</b> in developing countries. The livelihoods of rural women are often particularly dependent on forest resources, and yet REDD+ appears to be developing as a gender-blind institution. In this paper, I argue that REDD+ should be framed as an international development initiative. Following Amartya Sen’s capabilities approach, this requires that all members of <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities</b> be provided with opportunities to substantively participate in REDD+ programs. Community forestry programs offer a valuable precedent for REDD+.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{critically}} evaluate past forest management policies and property rights regimes in achieving sustainability of the Sundarbans Mangrove Forest (SMF) in Bangladesh. The adequacy of forest policies to reflect regimes of property rights in their design and implementation is examined using content analysis. The analysis synthesises forest policies of four distinct historical time periods, and the embedding of property rights during those periods using Schlager and Ostrom's typology. The findings reveal the inadequacy of the existing state property rights regime to secure the livelihood of 3. 5 million people in marginalised and disadvantaged <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities,</b> and to achieve sustainability in the SMF by reversing the trend of rapid reduction of forest resources. The challenge, therefore, is to find an alternative property rights regime to address the missing link between conservation and livelihood-security of <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities</b> using sustainable management practices in the SMF. ...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change is}} an {{important}} driver of changes in forests. As forests and forest-dependent societies {{are likely to be}} affected by climate change and its associated disturbances, adaptation is needed for reducing the vulnerability of forests to climate change. New challenges arise from the need to understand the vulnerability of forests and <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities</b> to climate change and to facilitate how they adapt to the changes. Forests also play a role in how the broader society adapts to climate change because forests provide diverse ecosystem services that contribute to human well-being and reduce social vulnerability. For this reason, forests should be considered in planning the adaptation of the society beyond forests. Ecosystem-based adaptation, an emerging approach to dealing forests in a changing climate, offers opportunities for forest and <b>forest-dependent</b> <b>communities</b> and supports the conservation or sustainable management of forests. This chapter presents an overview of climate change as a driver of changes in forests, the challenges and opportunities of adapting forests and the use of forests in adaptation practices, as well as the associated policy issues.

Rural forest-dependent households in twelve villages in eastern and southern Cameroon. Household heads and their non-pregnant, non-lactating spouses. Forty-seven unique forest foods were identified; of these, seventeen were consumed by 98 % of respondents over the course of one week and by 17 % of women during the two 24 h recall periods. Although forest foods contributed approximately half of women’s total daily energy intake, considerably greater contributions were made to vitamin A (93 %), Na (100 %), Fe (85 %), Zn (88 %) and Ca (89 %) intakes.
