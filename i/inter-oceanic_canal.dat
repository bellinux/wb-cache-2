5|$|Arguably the Taylor administration's {{definitive}} accomplishment {{in foreign}} policy was the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850, regarding a proposed <b>inter-oceanic</b> <b>canal</b> through Central America. While the U.S. and Britain were on friendly terms, {{and the construction of}} such a canal was decades away from reality, the mere possibility put the two nations in an uneasy position. For several years, Britain had been seizing strategic points, particularly the Mosquito Coast on the eastern coast of present-day Nicaragua. Negotiations were held with Britain that resulted in the landmark Clayton–Bulwer Treaty. Both nations agreed not to claim control of any canal that might be built in Nicaragua. The treaty promoted development of an Anglo-American alliance; its completion was Taylor's last action as president.|$|E
25|$|The nexus between {{competing}} demands such as irrigation, navigation, and hydroelectric potential {{has created}} management challenges and conflicts between these sectors.

When the House Committee on Rivers and Harbors was established on December 19, 1883, the Committee on Commerce relinquished its jurisdiction over appropriations for the improvement of rivers and harbors. But when the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 was passed, its Interstate Commerce Commission added greatly to the committee's purview and the commercial regulation of railroads.|$|R
