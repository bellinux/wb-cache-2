25|$|In 1942, as World War II {{started to}} have an effect on American life, many schools began {{dropping}} less popular sports as transportation and hiring qualified coaches became a serious issue. The association polled its membership to investigate the possibility of ending the spring sports season. The poll supported keeping the season. All over the country, as gas rationing threatened to prevent teams and officials from traveling, IHSA Secretary Al Willis was able to get special exemptions for Illinois teams and officials; a precedent that spread to other states, very likely saving high school competitions during the war. By 1943, the IHSA <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> making changes to its rules regarding eligible coaches, and the prospect of military veterans returning to high school. Ironically, the federal government eventually did put a limit to post season travel for high schools in May, 1945; too late to stop Illinois' spring tournaments, and just in time to herald the end of the war. In the end, the IHSA did not curtail its sports tournaments throughout the war.|$|E

500|$|In {{the third}} round of the League Cup, Arsenal faced Derby County at Pride Park. Wenger made several first team changes to give his younger players playing time; Arsenal ran out 2–1 winners, a {{performance}} where [...] "every touch by a Derby player was greeted with ironic cheers." [...] However, the team were beaten comprehensively in the next round to Chelsea at Highbury, losing 0–5. The result inflicted Arsenal's biggest defeat in over eight years and Wenger defended his team selection, virtually a 'second team': [...] "I knew before the game that this kind of thing might happen. You only <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the team sheets. If we had won I would still have gone on playing the same side because the players need the experience." [...] Bergkamp, who was rested for the match, echoed his manager's comments: [...] "We had a lot of young players on the field against Chelsea and, although they were feeling very down after losing like that, they will learn from it. To be honest, the scoreline doesn't mean anything, whether it was 1–0 or 5–0. The supporters will feel bad but I hope they understand Saturday will be a different game [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{science fiction}} heroes have, Porter argues, [...] "grown greyer over time", Jack {{represents}} as of Children of Earth a culmination of this trend, {{resulting in a}} full [...] "devolution/deconstruction of the traditional hero". In Children of Earth, Jack has to sacrifice his own grandson to save the world. Barrowman was concerned that the storyline could have made the character unpopular. He believes however that Jack was given the tough decision on how to save humanity; the actor says [...] "when I read all of the stuff he had to do, I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it {{from the point of}} view of 'I'm Jack Harkness and I'm right'." [...] For Lynnette Porter, Jack's actions in the serial make him [...] "a benchmark for [...] grey heroes"; some audiences may even view him, in light of his actions, as [...] "villainous or downright monstrous." [...] Although Jack ultimately saves the majority of the world's children and finds a way to foil the monstrous 456, the situation in which he is placed forces him to make a morally difficult (and to some viewers, reprehensible) decision. Such, Porter argues, is the mark of a grey hero. Davies stated in an interview with SFX that he [...] "loved" [...] the uproarious reaction to Jack's actions, defending the character in saying [...] "He saved every single child in the world! If you would fail to do that then you’re the monster, frankly. It’s this extraordinary treatment that only science fiction heroes get." [...] When Jack is departing Earth, the music playing is titled [...] "Redemption", signifying that his departure is also perhaps his redeeming act in the serial.|$|E

Much of the initial work fell upon Romani, who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{a number of possible}} sources, and he became irritated by the task, finally hoping that a shipment of books from Paris would reveal a suitable one.

2500|$|But that {{conclusion}} was not enough.

[...] " [...] was preceded by very little helpful history, and followed by very little illuminating history or adjudication," [...] wrote Coffin. [...] "We work with a scattering of crumbs—and, hopefully, a sound sense of the balance struck by the Convention between deeply felt national policies and the desire to facilitate international arbitration." [...] He found its language at first contradictory, requiring that any matter found arbitrable in a member country be arbitrated, but also saying that awards need not be enforced if they were found against the public policy of the country being asked to do so." ...|$|E

2500|$|The new 15-year Terms of Business Agreement {{with the}} Ministry of Defence did result in some {{controversy}} however. On 30 June 2009, a BVT memo was leaked which suggested {{that two of}} the company's three shipyards could be closed following completion of Queen Elizabeth-class carrier construction. In response to the leak, BVT said the memo was [...] "worst-case scenario planning" [...] and that it continues to invest in the future of all its yards. However a MOD spokesman said [...] " [...] <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the consequences of reduced demand for navy shipbuilding." [...] No firm decisions will be taken until after the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014 as London {{has made it clear that}} it would not buy warships from a foreign shipyard.

2500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeffrey Vance {{said that}} Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters {{and the truth}} of the situation. [...] "She doesn't act," [...] said Camille co-star Rex O’Malley; [...] "she lives her roles." [...] Director Clarence Brown, who made seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer [...] "Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. If she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> one person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn't have to change her expression. You could see it in her eyes as she looked from one to the other. And nobody else has {{been able to do that}} on screen." [...] Director George Sidney adds [...] "You could call it underplaying but in underplaying she overplayed everyone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opinions vary as to French's {{military}} abilities. Edward Spears, then a subaltern liaising between French and Lanrezac, {{later wrote}} of the former: [...] "You only <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him {{to see that he}} was a brave, determined man ... I learnt to love and to admire the man who never lost his head, and on whom danger had the effect it has on the wild boar: he would become morose, furious for a time, harsh, but he would face up and never shirk. He knew only one way of dealing with a difficulty, and that was to tackle it ... If he had once lost confidence in a man, justly or unjustly, that man could do no right in his eyes. He was as bad an enemy as he was a good friend ... once he had lost confidence in (Lanrezac) he ignored him and acted as if he and his Army did not exist." [...] Spears also recorded that at a conference with Joffre on 30 August 1914 French, the back of his tunic wet with sweat from riding hard to reach the meeting, was [...] "one of the coolest and calmest people at GHQ". This was at the time when he had decided that the BEF would have to retreat behind the Seine to refit.|$|E

2500|$|From there, word-of-mouth spread. In 2003, the {{non-profit}} Foundation for US Historical Monuments {{was formed to}} help bring about the monument's creation. After their efforts faltered, an anonymous [...] group of Wall Street bankers who lost friends and co-workers in the [...] 9/11 attacks learned about his sculpture. They commissioned Blumberg to build a large-scale version for a monument near Ground Zero, paying $500,000 for the work. The Gary Sinese Foundation and the Green Beret Foundation supported the effort to build the monument. No public funds were used. Two of the individual Wall Street supporters said they were asked by families and friends {{if there was a}} place that individuals could go to remember the U.S. troops overseas who daily combat potential terrorist threats. [...] "We wanted to do something for the special operations community and all military service branches, because every day since 9/11, we've <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that hole in the ground," [...] one of the private backers says.

[...] However, Coyne was unable to help prevent Colchester from being relegated {{at the end of}} the season. Coyne was named Colchester United club captain for the 2008–09 season, but selection for the Australia national team, injuries and a change of management meant that he struggled to hold on to a place in the first team, and {{at the end of the}} season, he met with the club management to resolve his future. He left the club by mutual consent in July 2009, saying, [...] "Unfortunately, after 18 months here, it's time to move on.

Also, there isn't much of a chance for the Australian manager to watch League One football but in Australia, I'm guaranteed to play 27 games in front of him."
