40|$|The {{determination}} of the geoid in South Korea is a national imperative for the modernization of height datums, specifically the orthometric height and the dynamic height, {{that are used to}} monitor hydrological systems and environments with accuracy and easy revision, if necessary. The <b>geometric</b> <b>heights</b> above a reference ellipsoid, routinely obtained by GPS, lead immediately to vertical control with respect to the geoid for hydrological purposes if the geoid height above the ellipsoid is known accurately. The geoid height is determined from gravimetric data, traditionally ground data, but in recent times also from airborne data. This paper illustrates the basic concepts for combining these two types of data and gives a preliminary performance assessment of either set or their combination for the {{determination of}} the geoid in South Korea. It is shown that the most critical aspect of the combination is the gravitational effect of the topographic masses above the geoid, which, if not properly taken into account, introduces a significant bias of about 8 mgal in the gravity anomalies, and which can lead to geoid height bias errors of up to 10 cm.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{equilibrium}} structure of vertical intense magnetic flux tubes on the Sun. Assuming cylindrical geometry, we solve the magnetohydrostatic equations {{in the thin}} flux-tube approximation, allowing for energy transport by radiation and convection. The radiative transfer equation is solved in the six-stream approximation, assuming gray opacity and local thermodynamic equilibrium. This constitutes a significant improvement over a previous study, in which the transfer was solved using the multidimensional generalization of the Eddington approximation. Convection in the flux tube is treated using mixing-length theory, with an additional parameter alpha, characterizing the suppression of convective energy transport in the tube by the strong magnetic field. The equations are solved using the method of partial linearization. We present results for tubes with different values of the magnetic field strength and radius at a fixed depth in the atmosphere. In general, we find that, at equal <b>geometric</b> <b>heights,</b> the temperature on the tube axis, compared to the ambient medium, is higher in the photosphere and lower in the convection zone, with the difference becoming larger for thicker tubes. At equal optical depths the tubes are generally hotter than their surroundings. The results are comparatively insensitive to alpha but depend upon whether radiative and convective energy transport operate simultaneously or in separate layers. A comparison of our results with semiempirical models shows that the temperature and intensity contrast are in broad agreement. However, the field strengths of the flux-tube models are somewhat lower than the values inferred from observations...|$|R
40|$|The Bogomolov {{conjecture}} for a curve claims finiteness of algebraic {{points on}} the curve which are small {{with respect to the}} canonical height.

As for the case of function fields with respect to the <b>geometric</b> <b>heights,</b> Cinkir has proved the conjecture over function fields of characteristic 0 and of transcendence degree 1. However, the conjecture has been open over other function fields. In this paper, we prove that the Bogomolov conjecture for curves holds over any function field. In fact, we show that any non-special closed subvariety of dimension 1 in an abelian variety over function fields has only a finite number of small points. This result is a consequence of the investigation of non-density of small points of closed subvarieties of abelian varieties of codimension 1. As a by-product, we remark that the geometric Bogomolov conjecture, which is a generalization of the Bogomolov conjecture for curves over function fields, holds for any abelian variety of dimension at most 3. Combining this result with our previous works, we see that the geometric Bogomolov conjecture holds for all abelian varieties for which the difference between its nowhere degeneracy rank and the dimension of its trace is not greater than 3.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} local (quasi-) geoid modelling from terrestrial gravity anomalies. Whereas this problem is uniquely solvable (up to spherical harmonic degree one) if gravity anomalies are globally available, the problem is non-unique if gravity anomalies are only available within a local area, which is the typical situation in local/regional gravity field modelling. We derive a mathematical description of the kernel of the gravity anomaly operator. The non-uniqueness can be removed using external height anomaly information, e. g., provided by GPS-levelling. The corresponding problem is formulated as a Cauchy problem for the Laplace equation. The existence and uniqueness of {{the solution of the}} Cauchy problem is guaranteed by the Cauchy–Kowalevskaya theorem. We propose several numerical procedures to compute the solution of the Cauchy problem from given differences between gravimetric and <b>geometric</b> <b>height</b> anomalies. We apply the numerical techniques to real data over the Netherlands and Germany. We show that we can compute a unique quasi-geoid from observed gravimetric and <b>geometric</b> <b>height</b> anomalies, which agree with the data within the expected noise level. We conclude that observed differences between gravimetric height anomalies and <b>geometric</b> <b>height</b> anomalies derived from GPS and levelling cannot only be attributed to systematic errors in the data sets, but are also caused by the intrinsic non-uniqueness of the problem of local quasi-geoid modelling from gravity anomalies. Hence, GPS-levelling data are necessary to get a unique solution, which also implies that they should not be used to validate local quasi-geoid solutions computed on the basis of gravity anomalies.

The classes are based on cloud characteristics (cloud thickness, light backscattering efficiency, and its variance), cloud absolute <b>geometric</b> <b>height,</b> cloud height relative to the tropopause, and the temperature at the cloud level. The successive use of principal component analysis, cluster methods, and linear discriminant analysis allows the identification of four cirrus classes. Almost all the cirrus detections correspond to three classes with similar proportion of the total cirrus detected (around 30 %). The absolute <b>geometric</b> <b>height</b> and the thickness are found to be the main discriminant variables. The first cirrus class corresponds to thin clouds above the local tropopause (absolute geometric height: 11. 5 km), or at least around the tropopause, while another class corresponds also to thin clouds but at a lower altitude range in the troposphere (absolute geometric height: 8. 6 km). The third class corresponds to thick clouds (thickness of 3. 2 km) located below the tropopause, in an altitude range between the two first classes (absolute geometric height: 9. 8 km).

As part of the European Space Agency Aerosol_cci project, aerosol layer height as derived from passive thermal and solar satellite sensors measurements, have been compared with aerosol layer heights estimated from CALIOP measurements. The Aerosol_cci project targeted dust type aerosol for this study. This ensures relatively unambiguous aerosol identification by the CALIOP processing chain. Dust layer height was estimated from thermal IASI measurements by four different algorithms (BIRA-IASB, DLR, LMD, LISA) and from solar GOME- 2 (KNMI) and SCIAMACHY (IUP) measurements. Due to differences in overpass time of the various satellites, a trajectory model was used to move the CALIOP derived dust heights {{in space and time}} to the IASI, GOME- 2 and SCIAMACHY dust height pixels. It is not possible to construct a unique dust layer height from the CALIOP data. Thus two CALIOP derived layer heights were used: the cumulative extinction height defined to be the height where the CALIOP extinction column is half of the total extinction column; and the <b>geometric</b> mean <b>height</b> which is defined as the geometrical mean of the top and bottom heights of the dust layer.
