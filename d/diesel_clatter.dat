50|$|The {{distinctive}} {{noise of}} a diesel engine is variably called <b>diesel</b> <b>clatter,</b> diesel nailing, or diesel knock. <b>Diesel</b> <b>clatter</b> is caused {{largely by the}} diesel combustion process; the sudden ignition of the diesel fuel when injected into the combustion chamber causes a pressure wave. Engine designers can reduce <b>diesel</b> <b>clatter</b> through: indirect injection; pilot or pre-injection; injection timing; injection rate; compression ratio; turbo boost; and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Common rail diesel injection systems permit multiple injection events {{as an aid to}} noise reduction. Diesel fuels with a higher octane rating modify the combustion process and reduce <b>diesel</b> <b>clatter.</b> CN (Cetane number) can be raised by distilling higher quality crude oil, by catalyzing a higher quality product or by using a cetane improving additive.|$|E
