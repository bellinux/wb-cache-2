Egosoft ensured a pilot would actually fit in their cockpit, and that a carrier vessel was actually large enough to carry a given number of ships. As such, ships and stations are noticeably different in size from prior games.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{incursion}} {{into southern}} Italy in 217 BC, Hannibal defeated the Roman {{forces in the}} battle of Cannae (216 BC).

One of these allies was the city of Herdonia in northern Apulia. It was the site of a general engagement between Hannibal and the Romans already in 212 BC (see the first battle of Herdonia), because despite the severe defeats on the battlefield Rome still managed to preserve intact the core of its system of alliances in Italy and continued to mount a slow but steady counter-offensive.|$|E

500|$|Australia and New Zealand {{experienced}} a garage and beat {{explosion in the}} mid-1960s. [...] Before the British Invasion hit, the land down under enjoyed a sizable surf rock scene, with popular bands such as the Atlantics, who had several instrumental hits, {{as well as the}} Aztecs and the Sunsets. [...] In late 1963 and early 1964 British Invasion influence started permeating the music scenes there. [...] In June 1964 the Beatles visited Australia as part of their world tour and were greeted by a crowd of an estimated 300,000 in Adelaide. [...] In response, many prior Australian surf bands adapted by adding vocals over guitars, and a <b>host</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> bands formed. [...] The first wave of British-inspired bands tended towards the pop-oriented sound of the Merseybeat. [...] With rise in popularity of bands such as the Rolling Stones and the Animals, a second wave of Australian bands emerged that favored a harder, blues-influenced approach.|$|E
500|$|Sarah Hughes of The Guardian {{was very}} {{complimentary}} towards the episode as a season premiere, remarking that [...] "The season opener deftly covers {{a huge amount}} of scene-setting while introducing a <b>host</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> characters."

[...] " [...] this was a leanly written episode, which tackled {{a huge amount of}} exposition and scene-setting but never wasted a word." [...] Nina Shen Rastogi, writing for Vulture, thought that the episode served as both a redefinition of the plot and an reintroduction of the first seasons's themes of violence and succession. She wrote, [...] "from the very first scene of last night's season premiere, GoT strove to reassure us that some things would never change." [...] Simon Abrams of Slant Magazine lauded [...] "The North Remembers" [...] as a [...] "thematically focused" [...] episode on the subject of good leadership. He enjoyed how each of the rulers were developed in the premiere and hoped {{that the rest of the}} season [...] "can keep up with its premiere's big ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|Progressive rock (also {{known as}} art rock) was {{ushered in the}} 1970s, {{directly}} following the combination of classical grandiosity and pop experimentalism from the 1960s. Although it reached widespread popularity, from 1976 onward, the genre declined in sales and was played with less frequency on FM radio. According to Breithaupt and Breithaupt, this created a vacuum for [...] "a <b>host</b> <b>of</b> <b>new,</b> milder 'serious' bands, whose humor (Queen), pop smarts (Supertramp), and style (Roxy Music, mach two) would ensure their survival into the eighties.... they met the melodic requirements of AM radio while still producing thoughtful, original work." [...] Bands like Queen and ELO played a type of progressive pop that was grounded in prog-rock without compromising their chart success. The Buggles' Geoff Downes, who considers his band to be a continuation of Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) and 10cc's progressive traditions, says: [...] "Those early 10cc records such as [...] 10cc and Sheet Music were pretty out there, and Godley & Creme took that even further. Even Abba had sections in their music that were quite intricate. We loved all that studio trickery and experimentation. Parallel to that were bands like Yes, who were experimenting in the studio in a more progressive rock format." ...|$|E
