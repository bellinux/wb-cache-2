40|$|The {{isentropic}} {{change of}} an ideal gas is described by the well known relations pvk = const., Tv(k- 1) = const. and p(1 -k) Tk = const., where the exponent k {{is defined as the}} ratio of the constant pressure to the constant volume specific heat, k = Cp/Cy. The same relations can be used for real gases only if the differential isentropic changes under consideration are small. A better examination of the differential isentropic change shows that for p,v,T systems, there are three different <b>isentropic</b> <b>exponents</b> corresponding to each pair formed out of the variables p,v,T.

When this shock wave is {{perpendicular to the}} direction of the one-dimensional flow, a normal shock wave transforms the flow to a subsonic one. The thermodynamic variables involved are five, i. e. the pressure, the specific volume, the temperature, the enthalpy and the velocity of the flow. To determine their values after the normal Shock, five relations are used namely the equation of state, the enthalpy equation, the laws of conservation of impulse and energy, and the continuity of mass. For the simple case of a perfect gas, these relations are explicit and allow a straightforward solution of the system of the five equations. In the case of a real gas flow the system is solved numerically. The present work considers two other possibilities, i. e. the use of perfect gas like equations describing the phenomenon or the use of the Redlich-Kwong equation of state.

40|$|A {{generalized}} isentropic gas {{model is}} derived following earlier work by Kouremenos et al. in the 1980 s, by replacing the traditional adiabatic exponent γ by the real exponents γPv, γTv, and γPT, describing the isentropic pressure-volume, temperature-volume, and pressure-temperature relations respectively. The real adiabatic exponents are expressed as functions of state variables {{to take into}} account compressibility effects on the isentropic behavior of substances. Due to the implicit analytical nature of the real exponents, any equation of state or thermodynamic library can be used for their evaluation. The theoretical limits and overall behavior of the real isentropic gas model are explored for a Van der Waals substance. In the two opposing physical limits, the model is shown to reduce to the incompressible substance model for liquid densities and the ideal gas model as the temperature increases or the pressure goes to zero. The relation of the generalized isentropic gas model with other thermodynamic properties is explored, leading to the development of specific heat relations and other thermodynamic properties in terms of the real exponents γPv, γTv, and γPT. Besides providing alternative schemes for their evaluation, special features of thermodynamic properties such as the state of maximum density and inversion temperature {{may be related to the}} value of the <b>isentropic</b> <b>exponents</b> determined by the local compressibility of the substance. Due to the exact definitions of the real adiabatic exponents at a state point, the relations between properties is thermodynamically consistent – another physical requirement. The generalized isentropic gas model is then applied to isentropic flows to derive traditional gas dynamic relations such as speed of sound, stagnation properties, and choked flow conditions for non-ideal compressible fluid flows. Exact solutions are provided for Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans, and approximate Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions are explored for real gases. Finally, attributes of the fundamental derivative of gas dynamics are explored under the generalized isentropic gas model to gain new insights into its mathematical properties. Under the generalized isentropic model, the fundamental derivative is shown to satisfy both liquid and gaseous physical limits. Non-classical behavior is attributed to higher-order derivatives of the real exponents. The application of the generalized isentropic gas model is demonstrated and validated for use in non-ideal compressible fluid dynamic (NICFD) codes by simulation of the one-dimensional Euler equations for a standard shock tube problem. Several numerical schemes for the evaluation of thermodynamic properties of varying levels of accuracy are presented for evaluation of the isentropic gas model. In the application of the shock tube problem, the general equation for the speed of sound is demonstrated to be equivalent to the speed of sound of a Van der Waals gas, proving the validity of the model. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Our study covers {{thermodynamic}} performance quantities for binary refrigerant {{mixtures of}} R- 32 /R- 134 a with compositions of 20 / 80 %, 30 / 70 %, 40 / 60 % by mass {{for a wide}} range of thermodynamic conditions (pressure: 0. 2 - 3. 0 MPa, temperature: 240 - 480 °K and saturated conditions). The primary thrust of the study is the calculation of coefficient of performance (COP) values for refrigeration systems. Additional attention is also given to speed of sound data and to isentropic process changes. The relevant COPs are derived based on a simplified reference refrigeration cycle with one stage compression and throttling, saturated vapor and no liquid sub-cooling prior to the throttling valve. The COP values are given for various condensing and evaporating temperatures. For all calculations, a Peng - Robinson type equation of state is used to determine the necessary fluid properties. The enthalpy, entropy, and constant-pressure and constant-volume specific heats as well as the k-type <b>isentropic</b> change <b>exponents</b> are presented for all mixtures for the range of thermodynamics conditions listed above. Comparisons are made illustrating the influence of pressure and temperature on the k-type exponents kp,v, kT,v, and kp,T and on the ratio of specific heats k (k = cp/cv). Furthermore, graphs with speed of sound data for this extended range of conditions are also given...|$|R
