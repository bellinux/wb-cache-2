50|$|Levofenfluramine (INN), or (−)-3-trifluoromethyl-N-ethyl{{amphetamine}}, {{also known}} as (−)-fenfluramine or (R)-fenfluramine, is a drug of the amphetamine family that, itself (i.e., in enantiopure form), was never marketed. It is the levorotatory enantiomer of fenfluramine, the racemic form of the compound, whereas the dextrorotatory enantiomer is <b>dexfenfluramine.</b> Both fenfluramine and <b>dexfenfluramine</b> are anorectic agents {{that have been used}} clinically in the treatment of obesity (and hence, levofenfluramine has been as well since it is a component of fenfluramine).

50|$|In {{order to}} {{circumvent}} the number of feedback mechanisms that prevent most monotherapies from producing sustained large amounts of weight loss, it has been hypothesized that combinations of drugs {{may be more effective}} by targeting multiple pathways and possibly inhibiting feedback pathways that work to cause a plateau in weight loss. This was evidenced by the success of the combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or <b>dexfenfluramine,</b> popularly referred to phen-fen, in producing significant weight loss but fenfluramine and <b>dexfenfluramine</b> were pulled from the market due to safety fears regarding a potential link to heart valve damage. The damage was found to be a result of activity of fenfluramine and <b>dexfenfluramine</b> at the 5-HT2B serotonin receptor in heart valves. Newer combinations of SSRIs and phentermine, known as phenpro, have been used with equal efficiency as fenphen with no known heart valve damage due to lack of activity at this particular serotonin receptor due to SSRIs.

50|$|Fenfluramine was {{introduced}} on the U.S. market in 1973 and withdrawn in 1997. It is the racemic mixture of two enantiomers, <b>dexfenfluramine</b> and levofenfluramine. The drug increases {{the level of}} serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, appetite and other functions. Fenfluramine causes the release of serotonin by disrupting vesicular storage of the neurotransmitter, and reversing serotonin transporter function. The result is a feeling of fullness and reduced appetite.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, a {{paper in}} the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) from the Mayo Clinic {{discussed}} clinical findings in 24 people who had taken fen-phen. The authors noted that their findings suggested a possible correlation between mitral valve dysfunction {{and the use of}} these anorectic agents. Later in 1996, a 30-year-old woman developed heart problems after a month of using it; when she died in February 1997, the Boston Herald devoted a front page article to her. The FDA alerted medical doctors that it had received nine additional reports of the same type, and requested all health care professionals to report any such cases to the agency’s MedWatch program, or to their respective pharmaceutical manufacturers. The FDA subsequently received over a hundred additional reports of valvular heart disease in people taking fen-phen, fenfluramine alone or <b>dexfenfluramine</b> alone. The FDA requested that the manufacturers of fenfluramine and <b>dexfenfluramine</b> stress the potential risk to the heart in the drugs' labeling and in package inserts. As of 1997, the FDA was continuing to receive reports of valvular heart disease in persons who had taken these drugs. This disease typically involves the aortic and mitral valves.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dexfenfluramine</b> is {{believed}} to be solely responsible for the appetite suppressant properties of fenfluramine, of which it has been demonstrated to mediate predominantly via activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors through a combination of indirect serotonin releasing agent and direct serotonin receptor agonist activities (the latter of which are mediated fully by its active metabolite dexnorfenfluramine). Contrarily, levofenfluramine is thought to contribute only to unwanted side effects. Paradoxically, however, {{it has been shown that}} levofenfluramine too acts as a relatively potent releaser of serotonin, though with approximately 1/3rd of the efficacy of <b>dexfenfluramine,</b> As such, it would be expected to possess some degree of appetite suppressant properties as well, yet it does not. A potential explanation as to why levofenfluramine is not similarly an effective anorectic is that it has also been found to behave as a dopamine receptor antagonist, which, as dopamine antagonists like atypical antipsychotics are associated with causing increased appetite and weight gain—effects that their actions on dopamine receptors have been implicated in playing a role in the development of, is an action that could in theory cancel out the hypothetical serotonergically-mediated appetite suppressant effects of the compound. Of course, this is merely speculation and has not been proven.|$|E

5000|$|Serotoninergic synapses {{are thus}} a useful target for drugs to treat obesity and other {{conditions}} which affect appetite and mood (e.g. premenstrual syndrome; seasonal depression). The patent for using fluoxetine to treat {{premenstrual dysphoric disorder}} was licensed to Wurtman's startup, Interneuron, which in turn sold them to Lilly. This became the product marketed as Sarafem. [...] Wurtman's patent on using <b>Dexfenfluramine,</b> an isomer of fenfluramine, to suppress appetite was also licensed to Interneuron, which licensed the patents to Wyeth; this drug was withdrawn from the market in 1997 {{in relation to the}} [...] "Phen-fen" [...] controversy.|$|E
50|$|Levonorfenfluramine, {{an active}} {{metabolite}} of levofenfluramine, {{is also a}} fairly potent serotonin releasing agent (with a potency of approximately 1/2 that of norfenfluramine and 1/6th that of <b>dexfenfluramine)</b> and, similarly to dexnorfenfluramine, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor agonist, {{as well as a}} somewhat less potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (about 1/2 that of its efficacy as a serotonin releaser). As such, likely contributes significantly to the biological activity—though not necessarily appetite suppressant effects—of not only levofenfluramine but of racemic fenfluramine as well. In contrast to levonorfenfluramine, levofenfluramine is virtually inactive as a reuptake inhibitor or releaser of norepinephrine, and neither compound has any effect on dopamine reuptake or release.|$|E

5000|$|Fenfluramine as {{a single}} drug was first {{introduced}} in the 1970s, but was not popular because it only temporarily reduced weight. A 1984 study found a weight loss of 7.5 kg on average in 24 weeks, as compared to 4.4 kg under placebo. It sold modestly until the 1990s, when it was combined with phentermine and heavily marketed. A similar drug, aminorex, had caused severe lung damage and [...] "provided reason to worry that similar drugs ... could {{increase the risk of}} a rare but often fatal lung disease, pulmonary hypertension." [...] In 1994, Wyeth official Fred Wilson expressed concerns about fenfluramine's labeling containing only four cases of pulmonary hypertension when a total of 41 had been observed, but no action was taken until 1996. In 1995, Wyeth introduced <b>dexfenfluramine</b> (the dextro isomer, marketed as Redux), which it hoped would cause fewer adverse effects. However, the medical officer of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Leo Lutwak, insisted upon a black box warning of pulmonary hypertension risks. After Lutwak refused to approve the drug, the FDA management had someone else sign it and approved the drug with no black box warning for marketing in 1996. European regulators required a major warning of pulmonary hypertension risks.|$|E
40|$|Background-The {{incidence}} of {{pulmonary arterial hypertension}} secondary {{to the use of}} indirect serotinergic agonists such as aminorex and <b>dexfenfluramine</b> led to the "serotonin hypothesis" of pulmonary arterial hypertension; however, the role of serotonin in dexfenfluramine-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension remains controversial. Here, we used novel transgenic mice lacking peripheral serotonin (deficient in tryptophan hydroxylase- 1; Tph 1 (-/-) mice) or overexpressing the gene for the human serotonin transporter (SERT; SERT+ mice) to investigate this further. Methods and Results-Dexfenfluramine administration (5 mg. kg(- 1). d(- 1) PO for 28 days) increased systolic right ventricular pressure and pulmonary vascular remodeling in wild-type mice but not in Tph 1 (-/-) mice, which suggests that dexfenfluramine-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension is dependent on serotonin synthesis. <b>Dexfenfluramine</b> was also administered to normoxic SERT+ mice and SERT+ mice exposed to chronic hypoxia. <b>Dexfenfluramine</b> and SERT overexpression had additive effects in increasing pulmonary vascular remodeling; however, in hypoxic SERT+ mice, <b>dexfenfluramine</b> reduced both systolic right ventricular pressure and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Pulmonary arterial fibroblasts from SERT+ mice, but not wild-type mice, proliferated in response to hypoxia. <b>Dexfenfluramine</b> inhibited hypoxia-induced proliferation of pulmonary arterial fibroblasts derived from SERT+ mice in a manner dependent on SERT activity. <b>Dexfenfluramine</b> also inhibited the hypoxia-mediated increase in phosphorylation of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in SERT+ pulmonary arterial fibroblasts.

40|$|International audienceThe now-banned {{anorectic}} molecule, <b>dexfenfluramine,</b> promotes serotonin release {{through a}} serotonin transporter-dependent mechanism, {{and it has}} been widely prescribed for the treatment of obesity. Previous studies have identified that 5 -HT(2 B) receptors have important roles in <b>dexfenfluramine</b> side effects, that is, pulmonary hypertension, plasma serotonin level regulation, and valvulopathy. We thus investigated a putative contribution of 5 -HT(2 B) receptors in dexfenfluramine-dependent feeding behavior in mice. Interestingly, the hypophagic response to <b>dexfenfluramine</b> (3 - 10 [*]mg/kg) observed in wild-type mice (1 - 4 [*]h) was eliminated in mice lacking 5 -HT(2 B) receptors (5 -HT(2 B) (-/-)). These findings were further validated by the lack of hypophagic response to <b>dexfenfluramine</b> in wild-type mice treated with RS 127445, a highly selective and potent antagonist (pKi= 8. 22 ± 0. 24). Using microdialysis, we observed that in 5 -HT(2 B) (-/-) awake mice, the dexfenfluramine-induced hypothalamic peak of serotonin release (1 [*]h) was strongly reduced (fourfold) compared with wild type. Moreover, using hypothalamic synaptosomes, we established the serotonergic neuron autonomous properties of this effect: a strong serotonin release was observed upon <b>dexfenfluramine</b> stimulation of synaptosome preparation from wild type but not from mice lacking active 5 -HT(2 B) receptors.

Thirteen healthy male subjects received placebo and single oral doses of 40 mg (n= 6) or 60 mg (n= 7) of the potent 5 -HT releaser <b>dexfenfluramine</b> separated by an interval of 14 days. Three further subjects received placebo on both days. Two hours after placebo/drug administration, 250 MBq of the 5 -HT(2 A) receptor selective PET-radiotracer [(18) F]altanserin was administered intravenously as a 30 s bolus. Dynamic PET data were subsequently acquired over 90 min. Moreover, arterial blood samples were drawn for measurement of total activity and metabolite correction of the input function. <b>Dexfenfluramine</b> as well as cortisol and prolactin plasma concentration-time profiles was quantitatively determined.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{suggestion}} of a possible relationship between the intake of the appetite suppressant <b>dexfenfluramine</b> {{and the development of}} primary pulmonary hypertension. We investigated the pulmonary vascular effects of acute intravenous <b>dexfenfluramine</b> in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs ventilated in hyperoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen, FIO 2, 0. 4) and either challenged with a FIO 2 of 0. 1 to induce hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (n = 20) or given autologous blood clots to induce embolic pulmonary hypertension (n = 6). Pulmonary vascular tone was evaluated by multipoint (mean pulmonary artery pressure [Ppa] - pulmonary artery occluded pressure [Ppao]) /cardiac output (Q) plots. Hypoxia increased Ppa - Ppao over the entire range of Q studied, from 1. 5 to 4. 0 L/min/m 2, in 12 dogs (responders) and had no significant effect on (Ppa - Ppao) /Q plots in 8 other dogs (nonresponders). <b>Dexfenfluramine</b> did not affect (Ppa - Ppao) /Q plots in 6 responders but shifted (Ppa - Ppao) /Q plots to higher pressures in hypoxia in 6 nonresponders (p < 0. 001). <b>Dexfenfluramine</b> had no effect on (Ppa - Ppao) /Q plots in the 6 dogs with embolic pulmonary hypertension.

40|$|We {{previously}} observed, {{using in}} vivo microdialysis, that the potassium-evoked release of frontocortical serotonin (5 -HT) is suppressed after rats receive high doses (30 mg/kg, i. p., daily for 3 days) of fluoxetine, a selective blocker of 5 -HT reuptake. We now describe similar impairments in 5 -HT release after repeated administration {{of two other}} 5 -HT uptake blockers, zimelidine and sertraline (both at 20 mg/kg, i. p. for 3 days) as well as after <b>dexfenfluramine</b> (7. 5 mg/kg, i. p. daily for 3 days), a drug which both releases 5 -HT and blocks its reuptake. Doses of these indirect serotonin agonists were about 4 - 6 times the drug's ED 50 in producing anorexia, a serotonin-related behavior. In addition, methiothepin (20 microM), a non-selective receptor antagonist, locally perfused through the dialysis probe 24 h after the last drug injection, enhanced K(+) -evoked release of 5 -HT at serotoninergic nerve terminals markedly in control rats and slightly in rats treated with high doses of <b>dexfenfluramine</b> or fluoxetine. On the other hand, pretreatment with methiothepin (10 mg/kg, i. p.) one hour before each of the daily doses of fluoxetine or <b>dexfenfluramine</b> given for 3 days, totally prevented the decrease in basal and K(+) -evoked release of 5 -HT.
