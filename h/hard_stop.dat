5|$|Different {{traditions and}} genres of poetry {{tend to use}} {{different}} meters, ranging from the Shakespearean iambic pentameter and the Homeric dactylic hexameter to the anapestic tetrameter used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a caesura (or pause) may be added (sometimes {{in place of a}} foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a feminine ending to soften it or be replaced by a spondee to emphasize it and create a <b>hard</b> <b>stop.</b> Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular. Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, iambic tetrameter in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.|$|E
2500|$|Two games later, {{they played}} the Edmonton Oilers. Winger David Booth was {{scheduled}} {{to return to the}} line-up {{for the first time since}} an ankle injury ended his previous season in March. During the morning practice he suffered a groin injury but returned for the game. Jordan Schroeder became the first casualty of shot blocking suffering a hairline fracture in his foot after being struck by a Nail Yakupov shot. Jensen was checked hard into the boards and sustained a shoulder injury. Dale Weise delivered a check to Taylor Hall striking the Oilers' forward in the head. Hall later said that the hit was [...] "probably a mistake on both parts" [...] and [...] "I have to have my head up". Hall was uninjured on the play and stayed in the game. The hit was reviewed by the NHL's Senior Vice President, and disciplinarian, Brendan Shanahan who suspended Weise for the remaining three games of the preseason. Later in the game Zack Kassian attempted to deliver a body check to Sam Gagner, who made a <b>hard</b> <b>stop</b> to avoid contact. Kassian began a spin move while swinging his stick towards Gagner, lost his balance so that it hit Gagner's head. He suffered a broken jaw, eventually missing the first 13 games of the season. Kassian was assessed a double minor penalty for high sticking. In a post game interview, Oilers head coach Dallas Eakins called the action [...] "a disturbing play by a disturbing player". During his disciplinary review of the play, Shanahan said that he accepted Kassian's claim that he did not intend to strike Gagner in the head, but that he was responsible for his actions. He suspended Kassian for eight games – the remaining three pre-season, and five regular season games.|$|E

5000|$|The {{film has}} been {{generally}} well received, being given four-star reviews by Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, Charlotte O'Sullivan of the Evening Standard and Emma Simmonds of The List, among others. The Voice newspaper called The <b>Hard</b> <b>Stop</b> [...] "an intimate documentary ... a profoundly humane, thought-provoking and topical testament, which gives {{a voice to}} people who are rarely heard." [...] Alice Charles in The Huffington Post noted that there was [...] "something undeniably poignant" [...] about the film, while acknowledging that it [...] "raises more questions than it answers." [...] According to Time Out, [...] "What the film ends up being about is opportunity: the opportunities we’re born with or without, and the opportunity to defy destiny by making the right choices. It’s not a happy watch - but it’s an essential one if you want better to understand the city and people around you." [...] Grace Hetherington in her review in The Metropolist gives The <b>Hard</b> <b>Stop</b> a five-star rating and observes: [...] "Amponsah wants the audience to connect with Marcus and Kurtis not just as subsidiaries of Mark Duggan’s character but as representatives of their own culture and the place they call home.... This film cleverly highlights that the riots did not initially start from hatred, but from a heart of frustration and from a seed of disdain between residents of Broadwater Farm estate and the police.... The film finishes with some hard-hitting truths. In Britain, since 1990 there have been over 1500 deaths in custody or following police contact. No officer has ever been convicted following an unlawful killing verdict.This film does not end on resolution, because it cannot. It highlights the repetitive society these residents are living in, transposing to deaths similar over in the US as of recent. It is a cycle of power, resentment and ultimately violence. And {{it is not just the}} people thrown into prison that have to realise their own demons in order for it to stop... The <b>Hard</b> <b>Stop</b> calls for those in authority to reflect on their wants and actions too, before it happens again." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} results of shock experiments conducted to demonstrate the advantages of two novel shock-protection technologies: 1) nonlinear spring shock stops and 2) soft coating shock stops. Both technologies basically employ the conventional idea of <b>hard</b> shock <b>stops</b> to decouple de-vice design from shock-protection design but are specialized to re-duce impact force, {{which is one of}} the drawbacks of <b>hard</b> <b>stops.</b> In addition, they enable wafer-level and batch fabrication processes compatible with microfabrication techniques. We designed test devices to reflect the effect of impact force and fabricated them using silicon microbeams (nonlinear springs) or Parylene coating (soft coating). After conducting multiple shock tests (up to 2500 g), we demonstrate that the shock-survival rates of test devices are considerably improved in both our novel technologies (nonlinear spring: 88 %, soft coating: 94 %) compared to conventional <b>hard</b> <b>stops</b> (4 %). Moreover, we demonstrated that shock protection is improved by optimizing the design of shock springs. Finally, we analyzed dynamics of flexible beams and identified a new device-fracture mechanism induced by impact force, which is different from conventionally known mechanisms.

50|$|In {{order to}} correct the error, an update was drafted in June 2006. However, two memory {{addresses}} were incorrectly handled in the update, which could allow values {{to be written into}} the wrong memory addresses and further complications with the mission. Five months later, the problematic memory addresses were called, resulting in the solar arrays being driven until they hit a <b>hard</b> <b>stop</b> and became unmovable. The complication led the spacecraft to incorrectly diagnose a failure of a gimbal motor causing the spacecraft to rotate to allow the unmovable solar array to point toward the Sun. However, in this position the remaining usable battery was also directed toward the Sun, resulting in the battery overheating and eventually failing. The spacecraft subsequently went into safe mode and contact with the spacecraft was lost.|$|E

50|$|Dynamic {{simulation}} (or {{dynamic system}} simulation) {{is the use}} of a computer program to model the time varying behavior of a system. The systems are typically described by ordinary differential equations or partial differential equations. As mathematical models incorporate real-world constraints, like gear backlash and rebound from a <b>hard</b> <b>stop,</b> equations become nonlinear. This requires numerical methods to solve the equations. A numerical simulation is done by stepping through a time interval and calculating the integral of the derivatives by approximating the area under the derivative curves. Some methods use a fixed step through the interval, and others use an adaptive step that can shrink or grow automatically to maintain an acceptable error tolerance. Some methods can use different time steps {{in different parts of the}} simulation model. Industrial uses of dynamic simulation are many and range from nuclear power, steam turbines, 6 degree of freedom vehicle modeling, electric motors, econometric models, biological systems, robot arms, mass spring dampers, hydraulic systems, and drug dose migration through the human body to name a few. These models can often be run in real time to give a virtual response close to the actual system. This is useful in process control and mechatronic systems for tuning the automatic control systems before they are connected to the real system, or for human training before they control the real system.Simulation is also used in computer games and animation and can be accelerated by using a physics engine, the technology used in many powerful computer graphics software programs, like 3ds Max, Maya, Lightwave, and many others to simulate physical characteristics. In computer animation, things like hair, cloth, liquid, fire, and particles can be easily modeled, while the human animator animates simpler objects. Computer-based dynamic animation was first used at a very simple level in the 1989 Pixar short film Knick Knack to move the fake snow in the snowglobe and pebbles in a fish tank.|$|E
