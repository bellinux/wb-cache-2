5000|$|Early {{on in the}} school's history, {{the athletes}} were {{referred}} to as the [...] "Fighting Teachers" [...] (the school's original name was [...] "Indiana State Teachers College"), until the students chose the name [...] "Sycamores", due to the abundance of sycamore trees in Indiana and especially in the Wabash River Valley; though it is believed that the students voted on 'Sycamores' on a lark, never thinking it would win. During the 1950s and 1960s, the sycamore tree itself was used as <b>Indiana</b> <b>State's</b> mascot. However, as a tree does not lend itself well to an athletic mascot, especially considering <b>Indiana</b> <b>State's</b> in-state rivalries with the Ball State Cardinals and Butler Bulldogs, the university created an Indian mascot named [...] "Chief Quabachi", and his [...] "Princess", in 1969. This change paid homage to the fact that ISU was the [...] "State" [...] university of a state named after Indians (prior to statehood Indiana was primarily inhabited by Indians). The university dropped the [...] "Chief Quabachi" [...] mascot in 1989 in response to a variety of objections over use of the Indian caricature and did not have another mascot until 1995, when a blue-and-white wolf named [...] "Sycamore Sam" [...] became <b>Indiana</b> <b>State's</b> mascot.|$|R
