50|$|Public {{disclosure}} is any non-confidential communication {{which an}} inventor or invention owner makes available {{to one or}} more members of the public, revealing the existence of the invention and enabling an appropriately experienced individual ("person having ordinary skill in the art") to reproduce the invention. In the U.S., public disclosure of an invention results in the loss of patentability of the invention after a period of one year. In other countries, public disclosure may result in the immediate loss of <b>invention</b> <b>patentability</b> unless a patent application has already been filed, and disclosure may be considered to include oral as well as written communication.|$|E
5000|$|After the Collapse of the Soviet Union, its {{successor}} {{states had}} no system for protection of intellectual property. A common patent system was perceived in a convention which was signed on 27 December 1991, but never entered into force.

50|$|A report {{into human}} genes and health was {{released}} by the ALRC in 2004. It contained 50 key recommendations, none of which were directed solely at the patenting of genetic materials and technologies; proposing specific laws for genetic materials and technologies may have implications for Australia's compliance with various obligations under several international trade agreements. Recommendations were directed at improvements in the patent system more generally, with many encouraging greater utilisation of existing mechanisms currently within the Patents Act 1990 and the Trade Practices Act 1974. The report explicitly recommended that social or ethical concerns should not be added as unequivocal grounds for excluding an <b>invention</b> from <b>patentability</b> under the Patents Act 1990. The ALRC did concede, however, that arguments in favour of a ban on genetic information were 'attractive'.|$|R
40|$|Patent law has during time {{evolved from}} {{industrial}} inventions to also include intellectual <b>inventions.</b> <b>Patentability</b> has as well changed with time. For technology to be patentable {{it must be}} considered to be a technical solution to a problem, and today genetic inventions are considered to be such a technical solution. From the beginning plants and animals were not considered as inventions; however, technology progress urged modifications of existing legislation to meet development progress within technology. European as well as international harmonization have been carried out in this field to ensure uniformity. The exclusion from patentability for plant and animal varieties can be found in several sources of law; this study focuses on the exclusions in Article 4 of Directive 98 / 44 /EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, as well as in Article 53 b of the European Patent Convention. After two specific cases from the European Patent Office the scope of the exclusion from patentability for plant and animal varieties was questioned. The two cases ONCO-mouse and Plant Genetic Systems had different outcomes, patent was granted in one case and not in the other; and that raised confusion as to the definition of plant and animal varieties, as both cases concerned genetic modification. Although there is no clear definition of plant and animal varieties, case law provides guidance to a certain extent, the reasoning in the case law also gives guidance as to where the judiciary is heading in its interpretation. There is more legislation concerning plant varieties, and the definition of this term might {{be considered to be}} clearer. The general opinion seems to be that what is said about plant varieties should be applied mutatis mutandis to animal varieties, and vice versa, however this may be questionable in some cases. The lack of a clear definition of the terms plant and animal varieties might result in a lack of legal certainty in this field, as demonstrated by the questioning of the two contradicting cases mentioned above. Rapid developments in the field of biotechnology imply that the patentability of plants and animals will be assessed on other grounds in the future. As biotechnology is an expanding area, the acceptance of new controversial inventions may occur on a more regular basis. Time will tell if this is the case...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{inception}} in 1982, the Federal Circuit has declined to take an overt role in setting patent policy. Dan Burk and Mark Lemley have observed that the court instead implicitly engineers patent policy through selective application of its patentability rules, which operate as 2 ̆ 2 policy levers. 2 ̆ 2 Recent decisions on the patentability of diagnostic and therapeutic methods illustrate a significant problem with this approach. By maintaining a façade of adjudicative rule formalism while tacitly manipulating its rules to approximate policy goals, the court perpetuates empirical uncertainty about the patent law 2 ̆ 7 s practical effects. This Article proposes that the Federal Circuit use the patentable subject matter doctrine as an explicit policy lever for calibrating patent scope. By prompting litigants to directly address factual questions underlying patent disputes, expressly pragmatic adjudication may serve an information-eliciting function and shed light on longstanding theoretical debates. The Delaware Chancery Court 2 ̆ 7 s adjudication of corporate law {{should serve as a}} model for the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s adjudication of patent law. This Article identifies queries specifically pertinent to recent and ongoing cases involving medical methods and suggests that the Federal Circuit raise similar empirical questions with respect to software patents, business method patents, and other <b>inventions</b> whose <b>patentability</b> is contested...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} <b>patentability,</b> <b>inventions</b> {{are evaluated}} {{in light of}} existing prior art. Innovators {{have a duty to}} disclose any prior art that they are aware of, but have no obligation to search. We study innovators' incentives to search for prior art, their search intensities and the timing of search. We distinguish between early state of the art search [...] conducted before R&D investment, and novelty search [...] conducted right before applying for a patent. We identify conditions in which innovators have no incentive to search for prior art. Search intensity increases with R&D cost, the examiners' expected search effort, and with patenting fees. We also find that innovators prefer to correlate their search technology with that of the patent office. In light of our model, we discuss the implications of some proposed policy reforms.

50|$|Patent {{examiners}} review patent {{applications to}} determine whether the invention(s) claimed in each of them should be granted a patent or whether the application should instead be refused. One of the most important tasks of a patent examiner is to review the disclosure in the application and to compare it to the prior art. This involves reading and understanding a patent application, searching the prior art (including prior patent applications and patents, scientific literature databases, etc.) to determine what contribution the invention makes over the prior art, and issuing office actions to explain to the applicants and their representatives (i.e., patent attorneys or agents) any objections that may exist against the grant of a patent. In other words, an examiner reviews a patent application substantively {{to determine whether}} it complies with the legal requirements for granting of a patent. A claimed <b>invention</b> must meet <b>patentability</b> requirements of novelty, inventive step or non-obviousness, industrial application (or utility) and sufficiency of disclosure.|$|R
40|$|This paper uses latest {{advances}} in economic research for examining {{recent changes in}} patent regimes aimed at strengthening patent protection, and beyond that, for rethinking the rationale of the patent system. Considering that economic theory does not regard patents as a natural right that should be systematically granted to inventors, but as a policy instrument aimed at fostering innovation and diffusion, three major implications {{can be drawn from}} economic theory regarding current policy debates. First, patents {{may not be the most}} effective means of protection for inventors to recover R&D investments when imitation is costly and first mover advantages are important. Moreover, they may do more bad than good to innovation if innovation is cumulative and first generation inventions are essential to develop further inventions, especially when patent protection is strong. Patents should not be seen as the solution by default, notably as regards new areas of patentability such as software, business methods and genetic <b>inventions.</b> Second, <b>patentability</b> requirements, such as novelty or non-obviousness, should be sufficiently stringent to avoid the grant of patents for inventions with low social value that increase the social cost of the patent system. Third, rather than the statutory patent life, what matters is the effective life of patents: the broader is a patent the longer is its effective life. Policy instruments affecting patent breadth (e. g. extra fee for independent claims above a certain threshold) and length (e. g. renewal fees) could be used to provide long effective lives to inventions with high social value. Beyond these currently debated issues, economic theory pleads for an in-depth reshuffling of the patent system. If the system were to be radically changed, an optimal patent policy could be based on a multidimensional menu of different degrees of patent protection associated to different patent fees, where stronger protection would correspond to higher fees. Patents could be transformed into self-selection mechanisms whereby patentees reveal the economic characteristics of their inventions, compensate society for the protection they are granted and obtain sufficient incentives to innovate...|$|R
40|$|Biotechnology {{either as}} a subject matter or {{invention}} and the act of patenting are relatively new to many developing countries. Biotechnological invention has limitless potentials. It is particularly important to pharmaceutical, medicinal, drug, chemicals, foods and agricultural industries worldwide. Developing countries {{could take advantage of}} the mandatory obligations of TRIPS as they have abundance of genetic resources. By supplying raw ingredients for biotechnology they may occupy the position of biotechnology producers globally.. This looks even brighter due to the current trend in patenting the same where the bar for non-obvious has been lowered drastically. This note explores on how the above current intellectual property trend and policy particularly in context of biotechnology law purportedly benefiting developing countries are putting constraints upon many of them instead. Firstly some background facts of TRIPS, which governs patent and is binding upon every country member domestically are presented. It then briefly explains biotechnology <b>invention,</b> the basic <b>patentability</b> requirements and the new trend of judicial courts in developed nations in interpreting the non-obvious requirement and reasons for doing so. Finally, the study will examine the disabilities of developing countries in overcoming even the much lowered standard of non-obvious requirement. This paper also points out that there are still many major tasks undone at national level which are hampering them from producing their first biotechnological invention or becoming active biotechnological producer...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} is {{a collection}} of four essays in applied microeconomic theory. The first chapter develops a theory of female labor supply in a general equilibrium framework where decisions are taken by the households and the power distribution among the members is determined endogenously. It is shown that female labor supply can take different shapes due to the structural differences between economies, and multiple equilibria might occur in the labor market. Policy implications of tax-benefits, subsidies for labor-saving household durables, and reservation for women at employment are worked out. The results found here resonate well with previous empirical findings and suggest additional testable implications. In the next chapter, Talia Bar and I study and criticize the current patent system in the United States, particularly, prior art search and its disclosure policy. To determine <b>patentability,</b> <b>inventions</b> are evaluated in light of existing prior art. Innovators have a duty to disclose any prior art that they are aware of, but have no obligation to search. We identify conditions in which innovators have no incentive to search. Search intensity increases with R&D cost, the examination intensity, and patenting fees. In the later half of the chapter, we study determinants of patent quality and the volume of patent applications. We model a policy reform proposal to establish a two-tiered patent system. Introducing a second patent-tier can reduce patent applications and the incidence of bad patents. We claim that innovators with high ex-ante probability of validity will more likely apply to the more valuable patent-tier, but sorting in the dimension of economic significance is not obvious. The last chapter provides a theoretical model for analyzing the behavior of peer-reviewed journals. It finds that, apart from natural human errors, inefficiencies arise purely for reasons of inter-journal strategic behavior. Specifically, as a result of competition, journals tend to set their quality cut-off points excessively low...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} that an invention have utility {{is one of}} the most fundamental of the patent laws. In the United States, for example, the concept of utility is rooted in the Constitution: Article 1, Section 8, gives Congress the power to grant exclusive rights to inventors in order “[t]o promote the progress of Science and useful Arts. ” Other jurisdictions recognize utility in the form of inventions that have “industrial applicability” or are “capable of exploitation in industry,” with all of these terms and phrases generally viewed as being synonymous. Historically, nearly every jurisdiction has excluded some type of <b>invention</b> from <b>patentability</b> as lacking utility. A common and enduring utility-based exclusion is the perpetual motion machine, with the justification being scientific: because perpetual motion is not physically possible, an invention which claims such a feature cannot in fact work and therefore fundamentally lacks utility. Jurisdictions also make exclusions on policy grounds. In Europe, for example, methods of treating human and animal bodies are not patentable, but the justification for doing so, which previously was based on lack of industrial applicability, is now expressly linked to public health policy. In an ever-more global economy, inventions are at the heart of commercial transactions that know no geographic boundaries and are increasingly valued for their job and wealth creation. Obtaining patent protection in multiple jurisdictions therefore is increasingly common. At least to reduce costs and increase efficiency, patent owners, policymakers and practitioners alike have sought increased inter jurisdictional cooperation and patent law harmonization in the patent examination and granting process. Recent publications, however, have identified a developing trend in Canada in which Canadian courts and the Canadian Intellectual Property Office are interpreting and applying the historically well-settled and generally harmonized utility requirement in a new and different way, in particular with respect to patents for pharmaceutical products. As a result, applicants for Canadian patents must meet conditions and overcome hurdles not required by other major patent offices. This article will compare Canada’s implementation and treatment of the utility requirement with the implementation and treatment practiced in the United States and Europe—two jurisdictions that represent prevailing approaches to utility and also constitute a major share of the world’s patenting activity. The article will first examine the statutory and judicial situation in each of the jurisdictions, including a review of the major international treaties and agreements to which each is subject. It will then present a case study that looks at the judicial challenges brought against various members of a single patent family in the United States, Europe, and Canada, and compare the results of those challenges. This analysis, we believe, reveals that the recent shift in Canada’s approach to the utility requirement conflicts with international norms and thus presents implications for patentees, patent law harmonization, and international treaty obligations...|$|R
40|$|Design patents {{have been}} part of American law since 1842. In that time, only just over 600, 000 design patents have been issued, with more than half of these being granted in the last twenty years. This {{quantity}} is dramatically fewer than the number of utility patents issued which is rapidly approaching 9, 000, 000 issued patents. Possibly because of the low usage of design patents over time, no case law and little literature address the constitutional issues raised by them. This article intends to overcome that shortcoming. Two constitutional aspects of design patents will be examined. First, congressional authority to adopt the design patent laws will be examined. The Constitution in Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 grants Congress specific powers to adopt both patents and copyrights. When a design is examined, it is unclear that it is an <b>invention</b> making its <b>patentability</b> suspect. At the same time, establishing a design as a writing is not problematic, leading to its eligibility for copyright. In this case, the clause itself must be examined to determine if something that qualifies only for copyright protection can nevertheless be granted a patent. The words chosen in the clause, particularly based on the way some of them were used in the Eighteenth Century, suggest that the answer is “no. ” Of course, any historical analysis of the Constitution may prove to be an inaccurate predictor of how modern courts would address an issue, but this analysis does suggest a significant Article I problem for design patents. Second, even if the Article I problem can be overcome, serious First Amendment issues are raised. Unlike a utility patent, design patents {{are far more likely to}} have direct impacts on speech. If so, the patent laws would have to accommodate that speech unless there is a compelling governmental need for it to not do so. Copyright law, for example, avoids much of this First Amendment conflict through the recognition of the Fair Use Defense under 17 U. S. C. § 107 which allow society to use copyrighted materials despite the legal protection where important First Amendment issues are raised. Patent law has no such defense, but may need one to avoid constitutional problems...|$|R
