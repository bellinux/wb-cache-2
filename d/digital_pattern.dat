5|$|Fractal-like {{patterns}} {{work because}} the human visual system efficiently discriminates images which have different fractal dimension or other second-order statistics like Fourier spatial amplitude spectra; objects simply appear to pop {{out from the}} background. Timothy O'Neill helped the Marine Corps to develop first a <b>digital</b> <b>pattern</b> for vehicles, then fabric for uniforms, which had two colour schemes, one designed for woodland, one for desert.|$|E
500|$|Digital {{camouflage}} patterns, {{widely used}} for uniforms with designs such as CADPAT and MARPAT, {{have been applied}} to the aircraft of some armed forces. For example, Jordan has painted its F-16 fighters in a <b>digital</b> <b>pattern,</b> and in 2008 Slovakia repainted its MiG-29 fighters in a disruptive pattern designed by HyperStealth, [...] "Digital Thunder". In 2017, a prototype of the Russian air force's Sukhoi Su-57 flew with a countershaded digital camouflage scheme, all dark above except for a multi-scale pattern at the edges.|$|E
2500|$|The Navy Working Uniform (NWU) is {{a utility}} uniform with {{multiple}} pockets on the shirt and trousers. Three {{versions of the}} uniform exist, each with a multi-color digital camouflage print pattern similar to those introduced by other services. Type I is predominantly blue with some gray {{for the majority of}} sailors. It was originally developed for shipboard use, but proved unsuitable for shipboard environments and is due to be discontinued in 2019. Type II is a desert <b>digital</b> <b>pattern</b> currently restricted to SEALs and other sailors such as Seabees assigned to Naval Special Warfare Units when in desert environments. Type III is a woodland <b>digital</b> <b>pattern</b> for sailors in shore commands and riverine units. The camouflage patterns are similar to the MARPAT Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform worn by U.S. Marines.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>pattern</b> {{generator}} is a {{piece of}} electronic test equipment or software used to generate digital electronics stimuli. Digital electronics stimuli are a specific kind of electrical waveform varying between two conventional voltages that correspond to two logic states ("low state" [...] and [...] "high state", [...] "0" [...] and [...] "1"). The main purpose of a <b>digital</b> <b>pattern</b> generator is to stimulate the inputs of a digital electronic device. For that reason, the voltage levels generated by a <b>digital</b> <b>pattern</b> generator are often compatible with digital electronics I/O standards - TTL, LVTTL, LVCMOS and LVDS, for instance. <b>Digital</b> <b>pattern</b> generators are sometimes referred to as [...] "pulse generator" [...] or [...] "pulse pattern generator" [...] which may be able to function as <b>digital</b> <b>pattern</b> generators as well. Hence, the distinction between the two types of equipment may not be clear. A <b>digital</b> <b>pattern</b> generator is a source of synchronous digital stimulus; the generated signal is interesting for testing digital electronics at logic level - this is why they are also called [...] "logic source". A pulse generator is of purpose to generate electrical pulse of different shapes; they are mostly used for tests at an electrical or analog level.Another common name for such equipment is [...] "digital logic source" [...] or [...] "logic source".|$|E

50|$|The root of {{the modern}} multi-scale {{camouflage}} patterns {{can be traced back}} to 1930s experiments in Europe for the German and Soviet armies. <b>Digital</b> <b>patterns</b> date to the 1970s with work by U.S. Army officer Lt. Col. Timothy O'Neill for camouflaging armoured vehicles. This was followed by Canadian development of Canadian Disruptive Pattern (CADPAT), first issued in 2002, and then with US work led by O'Neill which created Marine pattern (MARPAT), launched between 2002 and 2004.|$|R
5|$|When a <b>pattern</b> {{is called}} <b>digital,</b> this most often {{means that it}} is visibly {{composed}} of computer-generated pixels.
