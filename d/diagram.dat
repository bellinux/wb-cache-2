IK Pegasi A is currently a main sequence star—a term that is used to describe a nearly linear grouping of core hydrogen-fusing stars based on their position on the HR <b>diagram.</b> However, IK Pegasi A lies in a narrow, nearly vertical band of the HR <b>diagram</b> that is known as the instability strip. Stars in this band oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.|$|E

5|$|The Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year, {{originally}} {{known as}} the <b>Diagram</b> Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, commonly {{known as the}} <b>Diagram</b> Prize for short, is a humorous literary award that is given annually to a book with an unusual title. The prize is named after the <b>Diagram</b> Group, an information and graphics company based in London, and The Bookseller, a British trade magazine for the publishing industry. Originally organised to provide entertainment during the 1978 Frankfurt Book Fair, the prize has since been awarded every year by The Bookseller and is now organised by the magazine's diarist Horace Bent. The winner was initially decided by a panel of judges, but since 2000 the winner has been decided by a public vote on The Bookseller′s website.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} a dual {{tessellation}} can also be applied to partitions of the plane into finitely many regions. It {{is closely related to}} but not quite the same as planar graph duality in this case. For instance, the Voronoi <b>diagram</b> of a finite set of point sites is a partition of the plane into polygons within which one site is closer than any other. The sites on the convex hull of the input give rise to unbounded Voronoi polygons, two of whose sides are infinite rays rather than finite line segments. The dual of this <b>diagram</b> is the Delaunay triangulation of the input, a planar graph that connects two sites by an edge whenever there exists a circle that contains those two sites and no other sites. The edges of the convex hull of the input are also edges of the Delaunay triangulation, but they correspond to rays rather than line segments of the Voronoi <b>diagram.</b> This duality between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations can be turned into a duality between finite graphs in either of two ways: by adding an artificial vertex at infinity to the Voronoi <b>diagram,</b> to serve as the other endpoint for all of its rays, or by treating the bounded part of the Voronoi <b>diagram</b> as the weak dual of the Delaunay triangulation. Although the Voronoi <b>diagram</b> and Delaunay triangulation are dual, their embedding in the plane may have additional crossings beyond the crossings of dual pairs of edges. Each vertex of the Delaunay triangle is positioned within its corresponding face of the Voronoi <b>diagram.</b> Each vertex of the Voronoi <b>diagram</b> is positioned at the circumcenter of the corresponding triangle of the Delaunay triangulation, but this point may lie outside its triangle.|$|E

5|$|There are an {{infinite}} number of other intermediate processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of these possibilities there is a Feynman <b>diagram</b> describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided it is the case that the more complicated the <b>diagram</b> the less it contributes to the result, {{it is only a matter}} of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons it is a matter of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each <b>diagram</b> involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E

5|$|When {{the stars}} near the Sun are plotted on an HR <b>diagram,</b> it {{displays}} a distribution of stars of various masses, ages, and compositions. Many {{of the stars}} lie relatively close to a sloping curve with increasing absolute magnitude as the stars are hotter, known as main-sequence stars.

5|$|When {{the stars}} of a {{particular}} globular cluster are plotted on an HR <b>diagram,</b> in many cases {{nearly all of the}} stars fall upon a relatively well defined curve. This differs from the HR <b>diagram</b> of stars near the Sun, which lumps together stars of differing ages and origins. The shape of the curve for a globular cluster is characteristic of a grouping of stars that were formed at approximately the same time and from the same materials, differing only in their initial mass. As the position of each star in the HR <b>diagram</b> varies with age, the shape of the curve for a globular cluster can be used to measure the overall age of the star population.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we bring two {{concepts}} of generalizations of Voronoi <b>diagrams</b> together: {{the concept of}} abstract Voronoi <b>diagrams</b> invented by R.

While the concept of abstract Voronoi <b>diagrams</b> characterizes Voronoi <b>diagrams</b> by the set of bisecting curves, the concept of axiomatic Voronoi <b>diagrams</b> gives a characterization of the contour elements (from which bisectors are constructed). We show that “admissible” contour elements for the axiomatic approach generate “admissible” bisecting curves for the abstract approach.
