Because the beak is a sensitive organ with many sensory receptors, beak trimming or <b>debeaking</b> is [...] "acutely painful" [...] to the birds it is performed on. It is nonetheless routinely done to intensively farmed bird species, because it helps reduce the damage the flocks inflict on themselves due to a number of stress-induced behaviours, including cannibalism, [...] and [...] A cauterizing blade or infrared beam is used to cut off about half of the upper beak and {{about a third of the}} lower beak. Pain and sensitivity can persist for weeks or months after the procedure, and neuromas can form along the cut edges. Food intake typically decreases for some period after the beak is trimmed. However, studies show that trimmed poultry's adrenal glands weigh less, and their plasma corticosterone levels are lower than those found in untrimmed poultry, indicating that they are less stressed overall. A similar but separate practice, usually performed by an avian veterinarian or an experienced birdkeeper, involves clipping, filing or sanding the beaks of captive birds for health purposes—in order to correct or temporarily alleviate overgrowths or deformities and better allow the bird to go about its normal feeding and preening activities. [...] "Coping" [...] is the name for this practice amongst raptor keepers.|$|E

50|$|Beak-trimming, {{sometimes}} misleadingly termed <b>debeaking,</b> {{is perhaps}} most accurately described as ‘partial beak-amputation’. It is performed on poultry to reduce the incidence or damage caused by feather pecking or cannibalism and involves amputating the distal one to {{two thirds of the}} bird’s beak by either a blade or infra-red beam. Beak-trimming causes welfare concerns because the internal tissue of the beak contains many nerves which are transected during the process - it is only the surface and extreme tip of the beak that is keratinised, dead tissue. This can lead to neuromas (abnormal nerve regeneration) developing in the amputated beak stump from which there might be abnormal spontaneous neural discharges similar to the discharges originating from stump neuromas in human amputees and implicated in phantom limb pain.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Among {{the several}} factors {{required}} in breeding laying hens, <b>debeaking</b> {{is a factor}} that interferes with batch performance and affects animal welfare. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to evaluate three different <b>debeaking</b> procedures and to verify the best technique to be used. For this, the performance of the birds, the incidence of cannibalism, and in rearing phase, the quality of the eggs were evaluated. Dekalb White birds were distributed in a completely randomized design with three treatments, T 1 (infrared radiation <b>debeaking)</b> T 2 (hot blade <b>debeaking)</b> and T 3 (V <b>debeaking).</b> The data was submitted to Analysis of Variance and compared by Tukey’s test (95 %), using statistical software R. The frequencies of mortality and cannibalism were submitted to the Chi-Square test (Software R). It was observed that mortality was lower with IR <b>debeaking</b> in the breeding phase. Already in the rearing phase, the mortality was similar between the <b>debeaking</b> techniques and the cannibalism was null. The final mean weight (g), mean weight gain (g) and average daily weight gain in the rearing and egg quality variables were higher for V <b>debeaking</b> when compared to other techniques. It is concluded that V-debeaking provides better bird performance, resistance and shell thickness when compared to the infrared radiations and hot blade <b>debeaking,</b> in addition to subjecting the birds to less stress...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} farm animal welfare can, for {{practical}} purposes, {{be translated into}} the so-called Five Freedoms. [1] Organic farming aims to meet animal welfare needs and should therefore comply with these Freedoms. The first Freedom, from hunger and thirst, is met in any system properly managed to organic standards. The Freedom from thermal and physical discomfort is challenged as organic husbandry systems face more climatic extremes. However, they also provide more control to the animal by offering a choice when seeking warmth or a cool place to lie. The Freedom from pain, injury and disease is the most complicated one. Organic farming virtually bans mutilations (e. g. <b>debeaking,</b> tail docking), although some are still allowed and practised (e. g. castration). Organic animals are more exposed to wildlife and at risk of contracting infectious diseases. However, it is possible (although not proven) that organically managed animals are more resistant to illness. The Freedom to express normal behaviour is met through environmental enrichment and group housing. The Freedom from fear and distress is supported by e. g. extra (social) space. In conclusion, if animal health can be maintained, organic farming is very well placed to provide good animal welfar...|$|E
40|$|Q INCE feed cost is {{the major}} item of ex-^ p e n s e in reading pullets, the impor-tance of {{developing}} feeding programs which minimize this cost is obvious. Crowding pullets in laying houses {{in order to reduce}} housing costs may result in in-creased cannibalistic tendencies. Preventive measures such as pickguards, "peepers " or "specs " and antipick salves or sprays are being used commercially to control cannibal-ism. Research work on the effects of cannibal-ism preventive measures upon subsequent performance has not been extensive. Noles et al. (1962) demonstrated that the effects of <b>debeaking</b> varied between the 2 years of their experiment. Feed conversion followed the usual pattern with the best conversion in those instances where egg production was highest. Morgan (1957) reported that pullets which had either ^ of both beaks or of the upper beak removed when one day old weighed about the same as the non-de-beaked control birds at 5 months of age. The egg production of the pullets debeaked at day-old was better than the egg produc-tion of the controls, even though all pullets had 2 of the upper beak removed at hous-ing.

40|$|Introduction There have {{recently}} been {{major changes in the}} regulations governing the production of organic poultry products in the EU. Member States have been required to set Standards for production that meet the minimum set in Regulation (EC) 1804 / 99 if products, including poultry, are to be sold as organic within the EU. This has raised concerns over consistency of implementation in other Member States, and whether, directly or through derogation, this might lead to competitive advantage over the UK. MAFF were aware that France had drafted derogations in accordance with Regulation (EC) 1804 / 99, and intended to implement some aspects of the Regulation which were claimed to be more stringent than the basic requirements. The aim of this project was to establish any differences between France and the UK in the interpretation of Regulation (EC) 1804 / 1999 and the application of derogations within the standard, and to assess whether there was likely to be an effect on the competitiveness of UK organic poultry production. The project comprised a study tour of organic poultry production in France, and was undertaken by an experienced ADAS poultry consultant. Arrangements for the study tour were made in December 2000 and the study tour was undertaken between the 8 January 2001 and 14 January 2001. Results While {{for the most part the}} application of organic standards in France results in no competitive disadvantage to UK organic poultry producers, there are three aspects, related to laying hens, in which they do. These are detailed below. 1) 	 Derogations under 8. 5. 1 of the French Standards stipulate that the effective date for “production units already notified for the purposes of organic farming” is before the 30 August 2000, not the 24 August 1999 as in Regulation (EC) 1804 / 99, the the UKROFS Standards, and in the 22 May 2000 French authorities draft organic standards for transmission to the EU. It is difficult to see how the French authorities can justify the adoption of this later date which appears to contravene Regulation (EC) 1804 / 99. 2) 	Application of French organic Regulations to laying hens appears to contravene Regulation (EEC) 1274 / 91 on Special Marketing Terms relating to free range production. Regulation (EEC) 1274 / 91 requires that in order to use the term free range (or in French ‘plein air’) hens must have continuous daytime access to open-air runs, whose grounds must be mainly covered with vegetation. Secondly, the maximum permitted stocking density in the run is one hen per 10 m 2. The accepted practise of keeping hens in the house until 28 weeks of age in order to meet the requirement to rest outside runs for at least two months, and then stocking them in the runs at a high density (only 3 to 4 m 2 of run/hen), would appear to breach Regulation (EEC) 1274 / 91. Eggs from hens kept in this way should not therefore be sold as free range or organic in France, or exported to the UK. 3) 	The <b>debeaking</b> of pullets at eight to ten weeks of age as practised systematically in France would be unacceptable in the UK where beak trimming is allowed only up to 10 days of age. It is questionable whether eggs from French debeaked hens should be acceptable for export to the UK. Details relating to Standards, derogations, certification bodies, breed choice and suitability, house design and stocking density, outside runs and pasture management, feeding issues (in particular, the ban on the use of synthetic amino acids), cereal production, manure usage, marketing, economics, pullet rearing and organic research are reported more fully in the attached Scientific Report.
