Sojourner recounts how her mother told her to pray to God {{that she may have}} good masters and mistresses. She goes on to retell how her masters were not good to her, about how she was whipped for not understanding English, and how she would question God why he had not made her masters be good to her. Sojourner admits to the audience that she had once hated white people, but she says once she met her final master, Jesus, she was filled with love for everyone. Once enslaved <b>folks</b> <b>were</b> emancipated, she tells the crowd she knew her prayers had been answered.|$|E

500|$|As {{children}} {{coming of}} age, Scout and Jem face hard realities {{and learn from}} them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie {{the day after the}} trial, [...] "It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon... I always thought Maycomb <b>folks</b> <b>were</b> the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like". This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Abolitionist" [...] {{had several}} {{meanings}} at the time. The followers of William Lloyd Garrison, including Wendell Phillips and Frederick Douglass, demanded the [...] "immediate abolition of slavery", hence the name. A more pragmatic group of abolitionists, like Theodore Weld and Arthur Tappan, wanted immediate action, but that action {{might well be}} a program of gradual emancipation, with a long intermediate stage. [...] "Antislavery men", like John Quincy Adams, did what they could to limit slavery and end it where possible, but {{were not part of}} any abolitionist group. For example, in 1841 Adams represented the Amistad African slaves in the Supreme Court of the United States and argued that they should be set free. In the last years before the war, [...] "antislavery" [...] could mean the Northern majority, like Abraham Lincoln, who opposed expansion of slavery or its influence, as by the Kansas–Nebraska Act, or the Fugitive Slave Act. Many Southerners called all these abolitionists, without distinguishing them from the Garrisonians. James M. McPherson explains the abolitionists' deep beliefs: [...] "All people were equal in God's sight; the souls of black <b>folks</b> <b>were</b> as valuable as those of whites; for one of God's children to enslave another was a violation of the Higher Law, even if it was sanctioned by the Constitution." ...|$|E
2500|$|A chart {{battle between}} Blur and Oasis dubbed [...] "The Battle of Britpop" [...] brought Britpop to the {{forefront}} of the British press in 1995. The bands had initially praised each other but {{over the course of the}} year antagonisms between the two increased. Spurred on by the media, the groups became engaged in what the NME dubbed on the cover of its 12 August issue the [...] "British Heavyweight Championship" [...] with the pending release of Oasis' single [...] "Roll with It", and Blur's [...] "Country House" [...] on the same day. The battle pitted the two bands against each other, with the conflict as much about British class and regional divisions as it was about music. Oasis were taken as representing the North of England, while Blur represented the South. The event caught the public's imagination and gained mass media attention in national newspapers, tabloids, and even the BBC News. The NME wrote about the phenomenon, [...] "Yes, in a week where news leaked that Saddam Hussein was preparing nuclear weapons, everyday <b>folks</b> <b>were</b> still getting slaughtered in Bosnia and Mike Tyson was making his comeback, tabloids and broadsheets alike went Britpop crazy." [...] Blur won the battle of the bands, selling 274,000 copies to Oasis' 216,000 - the songs charting at number one and number two respectively. However, in the long run Oasis became more commercially successful than Blur. Unlike Blur, Oasis were able to achieve sustained sales in the United States thanks to the singles [...] "Wonderwall" [...] and [...] "Champagne Supernova". Oasis's second album (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995) eventually sold over four million copies in the UK, becoming the third best-selling album in British history. These subsequent successes led some members of the press to state in later years that Oasis [...] "lost the battle but won the war." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the Best Picture {{nomination}} of Beauty and the Beast at the 64th Academy Awards and its subsequent loss in March 1992, then-studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg opted to produce another animated sweeping romantic epic {{in hopes of}} replicating another Best Picture nomination. With Aladdin and The Lion King too far into development, Katzenberg believed that Pocahontas had a chance, and pushed for the title protagonist to be older, the romance between Pocahontas and Smith to be more adult, and for the animals to be mute. Head of Story Tom Sito went on the record stating he wanted to include more and broader jokes, but the [...] "higher-ups wanted it more winsome, more gentle. Some of the <b>folks</b> <b>were</b> so concerned about political correctness, they didn't want to be cuckoo-wacky about it." [...] Likewise, Eric Goldberg – following his work on Aladdin as the supervising animator for the Genie and {{with all of the}} animation units for The Lion King already occupied – was asked to co-direct Pocahontas with Gabriel, in which he agreed to and was given a pitch of the film. Goldberg had expected the film to be more comedic and cartoonish like Aladdin, but Schneider told Goldberg that the film would be produced in the vein of Beauty and the Beast, and the ongoing Los Angeles riots in 1992 further inspired him to commit to the film because of its racial overtones. The executive interference would eventually grow too much that Goldberg himself worked under the pseudonym [...] "Claude Raynes" [...] for Chuck Jones Productions during production. Executive paranoia reached a peak when Joe Grant had drawn Percy wearing an Indian feather, by which the animators took the concept one step further by placing a Spanish ruff on Meeko. One executive exclaimed, [...] "Animals don't have the intelligence to switch their clothes! They don't even have opposing thumbs." [...] The animators would retain their concept for the film.|$|E
