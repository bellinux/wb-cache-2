5|$|Calvin did {{not live}} to see the {{foundation}} of his work grow into an international movement; but his death allowed his ideas to break out of their city of origin, to succeed <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> their borders, and to establish their own distinct character.|$|E
5|$|Kristen Feilberg (1839–1919) {{stands as}} another Danish {{photographer}} known mainly for his images captured <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> {{the borders of}} Denmark. From the 1860s until the 1890s, Feilberg participated in expeditions to Sumatra, Singapore, and Penang. In 1867, he exhibited photos at an exhibition in Paris and in 1870 he joined an expedition to the Batak lands of East Sumatra, where he successfully recorded scores of ethnographic images.|$|E
5|$|An {{attacker}} having gained authentication material may impersonate the material's owner {{after the}} victim has patched Heartbleed, {{as long as}} the material is accepted (for example, until the password is changed or the private key revoked). Heartbleed therefore constitutes a critical threat to confidentiality. However, an attacker impersonating a victim may also alter data. Indirectly, Heartbleed's consequences may thus go <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> a confidentiality breach for many systems.|$|E

5|$|At {{this point}} the plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of the}} Enterprise coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime's executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve it <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> the point that he had developed when he pitched it for The Original Series.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 7th century Nahuan {{speakers}} rose {{to power}} in central Mexico. The people of the Toltec culture of Tula, which was active in central Mexico around the 10th century, {{are thought to have}} been Nahuatl speakers. By the 11th century, Nahuatl speakers were dominant in the Valley of Mexico and <b>far</b> <b>beyond,</b> with settlements including Azcapotzalco, Colhuacan and Cholula rising to prominence. Nahua migrations into the region from the north continued into the Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often visible to the naked eye.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to counting degree-three curves on a quintic three-fold, Candelas {{and his collaborators}} obtained a number of more general results for counting rational curves which went <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> the results obtained by mathematicians. Although the methods used in this work were based on physical intuition, mathematicians {{have gone on to}} prove rigorously some of the predictions of mirror symmetry. In particular, the enumerative predictions of mirror symmetry have now been rigorously proven.|$|E
5|$|It {{undertakes}} seasonal {{movements in}} response to the availability of water and food. African birds move southwards in the southern summer to breed and return north in the winter, and Asian populations are highly nomadic due to the variability of rainfall. This species has strong colonising tendencies, having expanded its range in Mexico, the US and the West Indies in recent decades. Wandering birds can turn up <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> the normal range, sometimes staying to nest, as in Morocco, Peru and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet {{in the hands of}} an inexperienced officer, and that most of the credit for the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E

5|$|Many {{bird species}} have {{established}} breeding populations in areas {{to which they}} have been introduced by humans. Some of these introductions have been deliberate; the ring-necked pheasant, for example, has been introduced around the world as a game bird. Others have been accidental, such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several North American cities after their escape from captivity. Some species, including cattle egret, yellow-headed caracara and galah, have spread naturally <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat.|$|E
5|$|On November 18, 2011, Hareide was {{appointed}} to lead the parliamentary committee that is investigating the 2011 Norway Attacks. His nomination to that position was proposed by the red-green parties. On January 23, 2012, Hareide denounced a speech at KrF's local chapter in Sarpsborg that had suggested that the terrorist attacks and the Alexander Kielland disaster were divine warnings or punishments for Norway's policy towards Israel; Hareide {{said that this was}} <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> normal thinking and completely out of line with the party's values.|$|E
5|$|Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is a {{provision}} of the Human Rights Act 1998 that enables the Act to take effect in the United Kingdom. The section requires courts to interpret both primary and subordinate legislation so that their provisions are compatible with the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights, which {{are also part of}} the Human Rights Act 1998. This interpretation goes <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> normal statutory interpretation, and includes past and future legislation, therefore preventing the Human Rights act from being impliedly repealed by subsequent contradictory legislation.|$|E

The {{appropriation}} did not cure the fair's financial woes, as fewer than 400,000 were sold at the premium price, and some 2,000,000 were released into circulation, where they remained {{as late as the}} 1950s. The pieces can be purchased in circulated condition for less than $20; coins in near-pristine state sell for about $1,000, far less than the $10,000 the makers of the Remington Typewriter paid as a publicity stunt in 1892 for the first specimen struck.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{circumstances}} {{such as a}} good {{breeding season}} followed by a food source failure the following year lead to irruptions in which large numbers of a species move <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> the normal range. Bohemian waxwings Bombycilla garrulus well show this unpredictable variation in annual numbers, with five major arrivals in Britain during the nineteenth century, but 18 between the years 1937 and 2000. Red crossbills Loxia curvirostra too are irruptive, with widespread invasions across England noted in 1251, 1593, 1757, and 1791.|$|E
5|$|The German {{aircraft}} carrier Graf Zeppelin {{was the lead}} ship {{in a class of}} two carriers of the same name ordered by the Kriegsmarine. She was the only {{aircraft carrier}} launched by Germany and represented part of the Kriegsmarines attempt to create a well-balanced oceangoing fleet, capable of projecting German naval power <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> the narrow confines of the Baltic and North Seas. The carrier would have had a complement of 42 fighters and dive bombers.|$|E

As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by directed evolution. The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications <b>far</b> <b>beyond</b> biology and medicine.|$|E
