5|$|<b>If</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Sea Harriers {{had been}} lost, the GR.3s would have {{replaced}} them in air patrol duties, {{even though the}} Harrier GR.3 was not designed for air defence operations; as such the GR.3s quickly had their outboard weapons pylons modified to take air-to-air Sidewinder missiles. From 10 to 24 May 1982, prior to British forces landing in the Falklands, a detachment of three GR.3s provided air defence for Ascension Island until three F-4 Phantom IIs arrived {{to take on this}} responsibility. During the Falklands War, the greatest threats to the Harriers were deemed to be surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and small arms fire from the ground. In total, four Harrier GR.3s and six Sea Harriers were lost to ground fire, accidents, or mechanical failure. More than 2,000 Harrier sorties were conducted during the conflict—equivalent to six sorties per day per aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-breasted munias have {{variable}} competitive {{behaviors that}} allow them to exploit scarce resources. There are two foraging alternatives: producers that make the food available and scroungers that steal food found by the producers. Studies show that these choices lead to a stable equilibrium within a group. When individuals are free to choose between producer and scrounger, frequency dependent selection results in a stable mixture of both behaviors where each receives similar payoff. Studies indicate that <b>if</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the population consists of producers, then scrounging behavior is favored by natural selection because there is plenty of food to steal. On the other hand, if most birds exhibit scrounging then the competition for stealing is so great that producing is favored.|$|E
25|$|The worst-hit {{area was}} in Varna's low-lying {{district}} of Asparuhovo, where dozens of houses were swept away and streets were virtually unrecognizable due to piles of mangled cars and debris. At least 11 people were initially confirmed killed in Asparuhovo, {{with at least}} two others missing. Much of the area remained without electricity for more than 24 hours before official restored it in the afternoon of June 20. It was not immediately clear <b>if</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the victims drowned inside houses or were swept away in their vehicles. On June 23 emergency services located the body of a 3-year-old girl in the ruins of a house in Asparuhovo, raising the death toll in Varna to 12. A six-year-old boy remained missing and was presumed dead. His body was discovered on June 26, bringing the final death toll from Asparuhovo up to 13.|$|E

500|$|There {{are only}} four other known survivals, secular or religious, of basse taille enamel on gold, one the small Salting Reliquary, {{also in the}} British Museum, and none as fine as the cup. The [...] "King John Cup" [...] in King's Lynn, of ca. 1340, silver-gilt with {{transparent}} enamel, is {{the best example of}} basse-taille work probably made in England; the metalwork expert Herbert Maryon describes this and the Royal Gold Cup as the [...] "two examples of outstanding merit, unsurpassed in any collection." [...] However it is unclear <b>if</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the enamel at King's Lynn is original. The closest comparison to the Royal Gold Cup is perhaps the silver-gilt Mérode Cup of about 1400, which is the only surviving medieval example of plique á jour enamel, a difficult technique which creates a see-through effect like stained glass. A silver-gilt cup in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam of before 1376 has no enamels or gems, and a different shape, but offers an interesting comparison as it has a tripod stand with winged grotesques as legs, a short stem, and the cover has both an elaborate finial and a raised decorated strip around the rim, so that all the altered aspects of the Royal Gold Cup are present.|$|E

2500|$|The {{tone of the}} 17th Party Congress was {{different}} from its predecessors; several old oppositionists became delegates, and were re-elected to the Central Committee. For instance, Bukharin, Zinoviev, Yevgeni Preobrazhensky and Georgy Pyatakov were all rehabilitated. All of them spoke at the congress, even <b>if</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> them were interrupted. The Congress was split between two dominant factions, radicals (mostly Stalinists) and moderates. Several groups were established before the congress, which either opposed the Stalinist leadership (the Ryutin Group) or opposed socio-economic policies of the Stalinist leadership (the Syrtsov–Lominadze Group, Eismont–Tolmachev Group and the group headed by Alexander Petrovich Smirnov amongst others). [...] Politicians, who had previously opposed the Stalinist leadership, could be rehabilitated if they renounced their former beliefs and began supporting Stalin's rule. [...] However, the leadership was not opening up; Kamenev and Zinoviev were arrested in 1932 (or {{in the beginning of}} 1933), and set free in 1934, and than rearrested in 1935, accused of being part of an assassination plot which killed Sergei Kirov.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, it is {{possible}} that some of these dwarfs were bought from elsewhere - or even came to Egypt voluntarily as a land where they could expect to rise to a high social status. In support for this hypothesis, Hermann Junker, Jacques Jean Clére and Hans Felix Wolf point to the Egyptian word Isww, [...] meaning [...] "I have bought (this)", and which often occurs in connection with dwarfs. However, it remains unclear <b>if</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the dwarfs and pygmies were bought or if they [...] "rented" [...] themselves to institutions such as temples, shrines and even the pharaoh's court. Especially during the Early Dynastic Period (c. 31002680 BC) and Old Kingdom (c. 26802180 BC), it was common in upper-class households that important sums of some kind were paid whenever dwarfs performed public dances or other duties. Similarly, valuables were exchanged whenever dwarfs and pygmies switched their employer or there was a change of the head of the house. Evidently, in rare cases, nanism would appear naturally within a healthy, normally grown family. Thus not all dwarfs and pygmies were inevitably gained by bestowal or acquisition.|$|E
2500|$|Personality {{traits are}} {{conceptualized}} by evolutionary psychologists as due to normal variation around an optimum, due to frequency-dependent selection (behavioral polymorphisms), or as facultative adaptations. Like variability in height, some personality traits may simply reflect inter-individual variability around a general optimum. Or, personality traits may represent different genetically predisposed [...] "behavioral morphs" [...] – alternate behavioral strategies {{that depend on}} the frequency of competing behavioral strategies in the population. For example, <b>if</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the population is generally trusting and gullible, the behavioral morph of being a [...] "cheater" [...] (or, in the extreme case, a sociopath) may be advantageous. Finally, like many other psychological adaptations, personality traits may be facultative – sensitive to typical variations in the social environment, especially during early development. For example, later born {{children are more likely}} than first borns to be rebellious, less conscientious and more open to new experiences, which may be advantageous to them given their particular niche in family structure. It {{is important to note that}} shared environmental influences do play a role in personality and are not always of less importance than genetic factors. However, shared environmental influences often decrease to near zero after adolescence but do not completely disappear.|$|E

2500|$|A typical {{book in the}} Redwall series details a {{particular}} period {{in the history of}} Redwall Abbey. In all but a few cases, the book is about the inhabitants of Redwall Abbey and the surrounding Mossflower Woods. Usually, {{there are at least two}} different stories going on. For example, a typical book may relate the story of a small expedition by a group of woodlanders, as well as the story of a large group of Redwallers at home fending off a vermin horde. Because of the widely spaced storylines (chronologically speaking), very few creatures are mentioned in more than one or two novels, except in a passing historical sense. One notable exception is Martin the Warrior, who appears in all books, even <b>if,</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the time, only in spirit form or no more than as a passing historical mention.
