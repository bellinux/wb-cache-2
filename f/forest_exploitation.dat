He added {{that he would have}} to leave her for a few days to find an American, a man from San Francisco, who was still somewhere in Europe. A few months before he had made his {{acquaintance}} in an old historic German town, situated in a mining district. The American had his womankind with him, but seemed lonely while they were sketching all day long the old doorways and the turreted corners of the mediaeval houses. Charles Gould had with him the inseparable companionship of the mine. The other man was interested in mining enterprises, knew something of Costaguana, and was no stranger to the name of Gould. They had talked together with some intimacy which was made possible by the difference of their ages. Charles wanted now to find that capitalist of shrewd mind and accessible character. His father's fortune in Costaguana, which he had supposed to be still considerable, seemed to have melted in the rascally crucible of revolutions. Apart from some ten thousand pounds deposited in England, there appeared to be nothing left except the house in Sulaco, a vague right of <b>forest</b> <b>exploitation</b> in a remote and savage district, and the San Tome Concession, which had attended his poor father to the very brink of the grave.|$|E

Moreover, grassland and water bodies are season dependent, so the increase and decrease in these classes highlights the use of images of at least two different seasons as the season always effect agriculture and grass cover.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to provide a basic {{knowledge}} in view of {{a better understanding of the}} global structure of threetropical forests at the Sakaerat Environmental Research Station (Pak Tong Chai district, Northeastern Thailand) : a drydipterocarp forest (DDF), a dry evergreen forest (DEF) and an intermediate stage (DDFwf), characterized by the absence offire since 29 years in a pyro-climax. These forest ecosystems were contrasted by the composition and floristic structure, thebasal area and the tree density. The species richness increases with the passage from the DDF, the most open environment, to the DDFwf, the most densely wooded. By these tree density and basal area, the DDF (602 trees/ha at DBH ³ 5 cm, 14. 2 m 2 /ha) and the DEF (992 trees/ha at DBH ³ 5 cm, 29. 0 m 2 /ha) studied belong to the typical tropical ecosytems of southeast Asia.

40|$|Mineral field ”Janja” extends {{over the}} Southwest slope of Stara Planina Mt., eastward {{from the village}} of Kalna in the belt of beech-fir <b>forests.</b> <b>Exploitation</b> of uranium used to be {{performed}} in three mines within this area, i. e. ”Mezdreja”, ”Gabrovnica”, and ”Srneći Do”, which are now closed down. One of the consequences of mining around these mines is partial degradation of natural balance. The greatest part of the terrain consists of granite, whereas metamorphic rocks are at the periphery. A geological survey with respect to the concentration of natural radioactive elements in the soil within the area of aforementioned mines has been conducted once so far. Alluvial sediment, ground and surface waters, as well as disposal were also examined. During the field study, radioactivity was measured and the methods of emanation and hydro-geochemical assessment were used, which was followed by collecting of samples for laboratory examination. The state of elements of the environment within the surveyed area is presented hereinafter {{on the basis of the}} existing data, having in mind that exploitation of uranium may disrupt natural balance in the long run.

40|$|This {{study is}} the result of {{research}} conducted on environmental conservation based on local culture as a symbolic study and reality of community behavior patterns. This study explores local knowledge in conserving and preventing environmental degradation, and efforts adopted by customary institutions and formal subdistrict government in preserving the environment. In this research, the approach used is ethnographic with the technique of tracing data. The grand theories used in exposing this problem are Max Weber's theory of social action, the theory of Behaviors, and Symbolic theory. This study found that Dewata Sewwae believers in the location targeted by the Tolotang Bacukiki symbolically are such communities that uphold familiarity with nature, and regard that the environment is part of their lifestyle. Similarly, by this research, the role of adat institutions and subdistrict governance in preserving the environment (forest) is significant.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the potential of}} the energy resolving hybrid pixel detector Timepix contacted to a CdTe sensor layer for the search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of Cd. We found that a CdTe sensor layer with 3 [*]mm thickness and 165 [*]μm pixel pitch is optimal with respect to the effective Majorana neutrino mass (mββ) sensitivity. In simulations, we were able to demonstrate a possible reduction of the background level caused by single electrons by approximately 75 % at a specific background rate of 10 − 3 counts/(kg×keV×yr) at a detection efficiency reduction of about 23 % with track analysis employing random decision <b>forests.</b> <b>Exploitation</b> of the imaging properties with track analysis leads to an improvement in sensitivity to mββ by about 22 %. After 5 years of measuring time, the sensitivity to mββ of a 420 [*]kg CdTe experiment (90 % Cd enrichment) would be 59 [*]meV on a 90 % confidence level for a specific single-electron background rate of 10 − 3 counts/(kg×keV×yr). The α-particle background can be suppressed by at least about six orders of magnitude.

40|$|Iroko (Milicia excelsa) is {{a commercially}} {{important}} timber tree species formerly known by local people in Benin. Because {{of the highly}} attractive technological properties of its wood and its multipurpose uses, the species was subjected to intensive human pressure. Apart from strong climate oscillation during the Pleistocene, human caused habitat fragmentation through continuous land clearing for agriculture, extensive <b>forests</b> <b>exploitation</b> and urbanization induced the occurrence of many isolated forest plots and trees species among which Milicia excelsa trees. As fragmentation was proved to have deleterious effects on genetic diversity within a species and its morphological structure, it was of interest to investigate the current demographic, morphological and genetic structure of M. excelsa before coming up with conservation strategies. In the current study, morphological variation and ecological structure of M. excelsa populations were assessed in Benin using transect sampling method and multivariate analyses including principal component, cluster and canonical discriminant analyses. On the basis of morphological parameters, M. excelsa individuals and populations were clustered into four and discrimination of groups indicated that most of variations were highly related to edaphic factors and annual rainfall.

The results indicate that reductions government spending have decreased agricultural support in terms of extension services and subsidies on farm inputs. The increase in prices of input factors relative to output has raised costs of farm inputs, cost of living in general and decreased disposable incomes for most rural dwellers, forcing some of them into extensive <b>forest</b> product <b>exploitation</b> and trade for each incomes. in the study sites, some forest products contribute between 50 - 70 % of annual household incomes. However not many households have the capacity to take the advantage of promising forest-based income generating activities. Economic hardships also led to changes in gender roles particularly in per-urban and intermediate sites. Women are increasingly expanding their roles, away from traditional domestic activities to income generating activities such as <b>forest</b> product <b>exploitation</b> and sale, casual labour and petty business. Men are gradually talking up activities which have traditionally been in the domain of women. The role of local institutions and traditional values in management of woodlands has declined. Village governments have replaced village and clan elders in land allocation. Local beliefs of value for forest protection and traditional property rights which influence utilization of communal resources have gradually been eroded. Some macro-economic policies have created conditions for broadening the cash income base of rural communities and have put value on some otherwise non-tradable forest products. Local communicates advocate for the full involvement in the management and use of these resources. ...|$|R
