40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel surface {{reconstruction}} technique based on Bayesian statistics: The measurement process {{as well as}} prior assumptions on the measured objects are modeled as probability distributions and Bayes ’ rule is used to infer a reconstruction of maximum probability. The key idea {{of this paper is}} to define both measurements and reconstructions as point clouds and describe all statistical assumptions in terms of this finite dimensional representation. This yields a discretization of the problem that can be solved using numerical optimization techniques. The resulting algorithm reconstructs both topology and geometry in form of a well-sampled point cloud with noise removed. In a final step, this representation is then converted into a triangle mesh. The proposed approach is conceptually simple and easy to extend.

The problem is important since phrasal structure in dance, {{plays a key role}} in communicating meaning. We detect two fundamental dance structures – ABA and the Rondo, as they form the basis for more complex movement sequences. There are two key ideas in our work – (a) the use of a topological framework for deterministic structure detection and (b) novel phrasal distance metrics. The topological graph formulation succinctly captures the domain knowledge about the structure. We show how an objective function can be constructed given the topology. The minimization of this function yields the phrasal structure and phrase boundaries. The distance incorporates both movement and hierarchical body structure. The results are excellent with low median error of 7 % (ABA) and 15 % (Rondo).
