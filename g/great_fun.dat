5|$|The {{cast and}} crew arrived in Sologne between February 6 and 15. Renoir's son Alain worked as an {{assistant}} camera operator and Dido Freire worked as the script girl. Renoir's assistants on the film were Koch, Zwobada and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Tony Corteggianni {{was hired as a}} technical advisor for the rabbit hunting sequence. The {{cast and crew}} stayed at Hotel Rat in Lamotte-Beuvron. Heavy rainfall prevented the start of shooting in Sologne for several weeks and Renoir rewrote parts of the script to accommodate the rain. While he finished the script the entire company played cards and bonded; they described it as a happy time in their lives just before the horrors of World War II began. Paulette Dubost said shooting the film was <b>great</b> <b>fun.</b>|$|E

25|$|Scene II: At Lady Sneerwell's, the scandal-mongers have <b>great</b> <b>fun</b> at {{the expense}} of friends not present. Lady Teazle and Maria arrive; Lady Teazle joins in, but Maria is disgusted. So is Sir Peter, when he arrives, and rather breaks up the party with his comments. He departs, the others retire to the next room, and Joseph seizes the {{opportunity}} to court Maria, who rejects him again. Lady Teazle returns and dismisses Maria, and it is revealed that she is seriously flirting with Joseph – who doesn't want her, but cannot afford to alienate her.|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was <b>great</b> <b>fun,</b> it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: [...] "it was <b>great</b> <b>fun,</b> but I fear I was not of much use". He returned to England in June 1919.|$|E

Series creator Ryan Murphy has stated {{that there are three}} relationships which are the cornerstone of Glee: those between Finn and Rachel, Will and Emma (Jayma Mays), and Will and Sue. Murphy explained that Will's seduction of Sue in [...] "Funk" [...] is an attempt to get her to leave the Glee club alone, expanding: [...] "I think he's just done getting pushed around by Sue, but they had <b>great</b> <b>fun</b> with that." ...|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers were {{critical}} of The Astonishings concept, including Consequence of Sound, who {{described it as}} [...] "very silly", but ultimately gave the album an overall positive review. By contrast, Record Collector described the storytelling as [...] "seamless". In their write-up, RTÉ.ie advised, [...] "park the snootiness before pressing the play button because while The Astonishing makes Iron Maiden's recent 92-minute double The Book of Souls look like a Ramones record, it's <b>great</b> <b>fun</b> ...

500|$|Following {{this public}} support, Boycott resumed writing for The Daily Telegraph and commentating on Channel Four for the Cheltenham and Gloucester Championship Final and the {{following}} summer's cricket. Radio Five Live then hired Boycott in early 2004. His fellow commentators state that his illness has altered his voice {{and led to a}} more pleasant personality, but that he is still prone to unpleasant behaviour. Channel Four producer Gary Francis stated [...] "I think Geoff is a lot more mellow now. He still has his moments, like when the taxi does not arrive and he is not happy, as he makes extremely clear.

500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Blackfish, {{spoke about}} working with Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth, noting [...] "There's {{something}} very curious, by the way, I'm probably about 6'6" [...] tall. I think she's about 6'3", but all the time I worked with her, I {{felt like she was}} taller than me. Now I don't really know what {{that has to do with}} it. It might be something to do with being confronted by a physically charismatic very tall woman, or maybe it's that she's caught the impressiveness of the character of that woman, that soldier. She's also an extraordinarily hilarious woman. We had <b>great</b> <b>fun</b> together. It was <b>great</b> <b>fun</b> to play." [...] Gwendoline Christie also spoke about filming with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who portrays Jaime Lannister, again, saying [...] "I was excited, It was really fun to be with Nikolaj again, and I thought the way of which their reunion happens is not really expected. I just loved that it was so formal, because within the confines of such formality, and having to negotiate with each other, there are so many other stories begging to be told in those moments. There's a slow process of creeping familiarity among two people who haven't been together for a long time; it was allowed to build." [...] Coster-Waldau also spoke about their first reunion scene, stating [...] "It's a great scene. These characters are so much about holding their cards so close to their chest and they don't want to reveal how they're feeling. But we know there's history between them, that this is more than two knights meeting. But they would never acknowledge that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Robin Hood and the Sorcerer" [...] {{was shot}} at Bowood House. Helen Phillips said of his {{performance}} as Little John, [...] "excellently played by Clive Mantle, the series' John at first appears to conform to a, by then, well- established stereotype." [...] Mantle has said of his role: It is the job I've enjoyed doing {{more than anything else}} on TV. I have the greatest memories of beautiful, halcyon days-out filming on location and we had such a <b>great,</b> <b>fun</b> crew working on the show. We still get together once a year. Not just the cast but also the directors, producer, props guys, it's like a family! I think the key to part of the series' success was that this great camaraderie came across on screen.|$|E

I wanted him to feel at home with us, to feel wanted." [...] Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.|$|E

He fell in love, got married--with a sort of whoop, as if it were the <b>greatest</b> <b>fun</b> in the world--and then began to find out things.|$|R

Despite this, {{the first episode}} of The Matty Johns Show was that day's most-watched program in Sydney with 396,000 viewers, and it {{collected}} another 199,000 viewers in Brisbane. Of the initial ratings, Johns said in a press statement, [...] "We’re humbled by the support for our show... Our aim was to produce a <b>great</b> <b>fun</b> footy show {{for the whole family}} and we’re glad people liked it." [...] Reporters Amanda Meade from The Australian and Michael Idato from The Sydney Morning Herald suggested after the first episode that the earlier timeslot gives The Matty Johns Show a ratings advantage over The Footy Show. The Daily Telegraphs Phil Rothfield stated that the first show put [...] "pressure" [...] on Paul Vautin, host of The Footy Show.|$|E

Years earlier, The Baroness {{was going to}} marry Duke, but he left her at the altar, due to his guilt over her brother's {{apparent}} death. Miller auditioned for the part because it did not involve [...] "having a breakdown or addicted to heroin or dying at the end, something that was just maybe really <b>great</b> <b>fun</b> and that people went to see and actually just had a great time seeing." [...] Miller prepared with four months of weight training, boxing sessions and learned to fire live ammunition, gaining five pounds of muscle. She sprained her wrist after slipping on a rubber bullet while filming a fight scene with Rachel Nichols.|$|E

[...] Hasselhoff enjoyed his cameo: [...] "It was <b>great</b> <b>fun</b> {{and to this day}} around the world kids stop me and say, 'Are you David Hasselhoff?' because I was the only human in the picture."
