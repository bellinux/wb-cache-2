In september 2017, {{he signed with}} APOP Paphos BC of the Cyprus Basketball Division A before returning to Iceland again and signing a one month deal with Stjarnan on October 15, with a team option of extending <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the season. He left Stjarnan on November 3 due to a back injury after appearing in two games.|$|E
25|$|On 9 June 1917, Bernert was {{transferred}} back to Jasta 2, and would command <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his flying career.

25|$|Carlos Reutemann, Nelson Piquet and Didier Pironi all {{retired from}} the race whilst in the lead, Reutemann due to a {{collision}} and Pironi and Piquet because of mechanical problems.

25|$|Manuel II's reign {{saw another}} {{temporary}} respite for the Byzantines. For an Empire in such trouble, {{he succeeded in}} retaking some territory and held <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his reign. His limited success largely came through the resurrection of Mongol Power in the East and the great friendship achieved between Manuel II and Mehmed I. However, he {{lived long enough to}} see his son undo much of his achievements.|$|E
25|$|Tarver won by {{unanimous}} decision (117–111, 116–112, 116–112) and had Jones out on {{his feet}} in the 12th round. Tarver landed 158 of 620 punches (25%) and Jones connected on 85 of 320 (27%). Despite being clearly behind from early in the contest, there was little urgency in either Jones' corner or his performance as he seemed content to make <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the fight following his back-to-back knockout losses.|$|E
25|$|In cricket, roundarm bowling is {{a bowling}} style that was {{introduced}} {{in the first quarter of}} the 19th century and largely superseded underarm bowling by the 1830s. Using a roundarm action, the bowler has their arm extended about 90 degrees from their body at the point where they release the ball. Roundarm fell into decline after 1864 when the current style of overarm bowling was legalised, although W. G. Grace continued to use <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his career.|$|E

50|$|Elastic {{filament}}s, 1 nm in diameter, {{are made}} of titin, a large springy protein.

Titin also stabilizes the thick filament, while centering it between the thin filaments. It also aids in preventing overstretching of the thick filament, recoiling like a spring whenever a muscle is stretched.|$|R
25|$|Although the 1984–85 season squad {{was made}} up of a mix of {{emerging}} players and mature stars, {{at the beginning of the}} season no one would have regarded the team as having the necessary ingredients to make <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end.</b> Certainly, the additions of Hans-Peter Briegel in midfield and of Danish striker Preben Elkjær to an attack that already featured the wing play of Pietro Fanna, the creative abilities of Antonio Di Gennaro and the scoring touch of Giuseppe Galderisi were to prove crucial.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Basso {{aimed to}} win his second Giro d'Italia, leading Team Liquigas with his {{teammate}} Vincenzo Nibali. Despite having a quiet start to the race, he won the 15th stage of the 2010 Giro d'Italia atop Monte Zoncolan, after his Liquigas team had set the pace for some 150km in order to chase down a breakaway. After Stage 19, he lead the general classification {{as a result of}} out-climbing previous race leader David Arroyo, and held <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the race. This resulted his second Giro win since 2006.|$|E
25|$|For many fans, {{this season}} {{is seen as the}} start of a sad demise for the series as the focus changed and popular {{characters}} such as Barbara Hamilton and Irene Fisher were hastily written out of the series. In Cornelia Frances' 2003 autobiography, she states that it was not her decision to leave the series, but that she had got {{on the wrong side of}} a producer and was suddenly axed. Other characters that failed to make <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the season include Leigh Palmer, Tim Palmer, Donna Palmer, Spider Webb, Brett Keegan, Adam Tate, Samantha Morrell, James Hamilton and Mary Reynolds. Consequently, there was an influx of poorly-received replacement characters such as Janice Reid, May Walters, Craig Maxwell, Doug Fletcher, Glenn Young, Debbie Halliday, Ginny Doyle and the return of Susan Todd.|$|E

25|$|The same {{as regular}} {{quicksort}} except the pivot {{is replaced by}} a buffer. First, read the M/2 first and last elements into the buffer and sort them. Read the next element from the beginning or end to balance writing. If the next element is less than the least of the buffer, write it to available space at the beginning. If greater than the greatest, write <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end.</b> Otherwise write the greatest or least of the buffer, and put the next element in the buffer. Keep the maximum lower and minimum upper keys written to avoid resorting middle elements that are in order. When done, write the buffer. Recursively sort the smaller partition, and loop to sort the remaining partition. This is a kind of three-way quicksort in which the middle partition (buffer) represents a sorted subarray of elements that are approximately equal to the pivot.|$|E
25|$|Nitschke and Lisa Sthalekar {{took three}} wickets each, but England fought back. Gunn took two more wickets, {{removing}} both openers for ducks, as Belinda Clark recorded a pair, but Karen Rolton and Sthalekar took the score beyond England's grasp. Rolton was finally run out for 97, {{but she had}} led the Australians to a 254-run lead {{at the end of}} day three. Australia added a further 51 to that on the fourth morning - slow left arm bowler Clare Connor taking four for 68 in a marathon bowling effort. England quickly determined 306 in 95 overs was too tough after they crumbled to 14 for 3, but Brindle stood firm at the crease, taking four hours for a maiden Test century, and England made <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the scheduled time having only lost seven wickets. Thus, the second Test would now decide the series.|$|E
25|$|It is {{relevant}} to note here that Turner was extremely conservative in {{his use of the}} word “Indian.” Instead he referred to the different Indian peoples by their culture’s name, such as Yaqui or Aztec, in order to humanize and emphasize their identities. For Turner, Díaz “created a machine and oiled the machine with the flesh and blood of a people. He rewarded all except the people; the people were the sacrifice.” Indians were seen as chattel and although Díaz’s regime justified its means for this treatment, Turner emphasizes this point. Additionally, Turner does not explicitly mention the científicos, but he makes a stand against the “scientific knowledge” of that time in regard to race; in a way, against positivism. He indirectly brings up issues surrounding the Indian questions of labor—through haciendas—and of education. Turner points out that regardless of the public primary schools that had been built, “what promise does study hold out for a youth born to shoulder a debt of his father and carry <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his days?” At its core, Turner’s question embodies the meaning of slavery, because that is precisely what he saw.|$|E

25|$|In October 2007, Shelley and Sabin {{started a}} feud with Team 3D, during which Team 3D {{declared}} {{a war on}} the entire X Division and was looking to kill it off. After months of feuding, Shelley and Sabin along with Jay Lethal were able to defeat Team 3D and Johnny Devine in a Street Fight at Against All Odds to save the X Division and to end the feud. With the win, Team 3D were forced to drop their weights under 275 pounds {{if they wanted to}} keep on wrestling for the company. Shelley then fought for Team TNA in the World X Cup alongside Kaz, the team captain, his tag team partner Chris Sabin, and Curry Man. On June 19, {{in the first round of}} the tournament, Shelley and Sabin defeated Daivari and Tyson Dux of Team International to give Team TNA their first point. In the finals of the tournament, held at Victory Road, Shelley, Sabin and Curry Man represented Team TNA in the twelve–man, four–team elimination tag team match. Shelley made <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the match and finally pinned Masato Yoshino of Team Japan to win the match and give Team TNA the lead ahead of the final round of the tournament, an Ultimate X match contested between the team captains. Despite Shelley's efforts, Team TNA was defeated in the final round by Team Mexico, who won the 2008 World X Cup. A month later, on July 25, 2008, Shelley and five other TNA wrestlers traveled to Mexico to compete in the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre International Grand Prix, contested in a sixteen–man torneo cibernetico match. In the end, Shelley managed to avenge Team TNA's loss in the World X Cup, by winning the Gran Prix, after pinning Último Guerrero. This led to a match on September 19 at CMLL's 75th Anniversary Show, where Shelley, Sabin and Sonjay Dutt unsuccessfully challenged Guerrero, Atlantis and Negro Casas for the CMLL World Trios Championship. After the tournaments Shelley and Sabin slipped into the role of tweeners, showing disrespect to Christian Cage, A.J. Styles, Consequences Creed, B.G. James and The Latin American Xchange however still being cheered heavily by the fans towards whom they did show respect.|$|E
