40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{follow-up}} to an earlier paper, <b>Field</b> <b>Balancing</b> in the Real World, which was presented at CSI Reliability Week 1997 in Nashville. Case studies of excessive vibrations on fans at ORNL will be discussed. Except for a few small sections from the earlier paper, this paper is entirely new. The case studies are new. As in the first paper, all fans are rigid-rotor type fans. Normal operation, therefore, is at less than the shaft's first critical speed. The presentation of case studies with root cause problems other than unbalance is a major departure from the first paper. We believe they belong here, since unbalance is suspected {{most of the time}} when a fan is vibrating excessively, even when it is not the root cause. In reality, unbalance is the underlying cause of the excess vibration on fans we have fixed at ORNL only about half the time. Furthermore, the analyst's credibility could be called into question upon an unsuccessful attempt at <b>field</b> <b>balancing</b> when underlying causes are later discovered and fixed.

40|$|The spatial {{variability}} of textural layers {{is a major}} factor influencing the field water and solute transport in alluvial soils. To quantify the water transport process at a regional scale accurately, one has to take the {{spatial variability}} of textural layers into account. In this paper, a recently presented Markov chain simulation model for soil textural profiles was coupled with a deterministic <b>field</b> water <b>balance</b> model to conduct a stochastic analysis of the <b>field</b> water <b>balance</b> in a 15 km(2) alluvial soil region. The aim is to assess the effect of spatial variability of textural layers on the <b>field</b> water <b>balance</b> at a regional scale. By combining simulated soil textural profiles with the <b>field</b> water <b>balance</b> model, the mean values, extreme values, and probability distributions of <b>field</b> water <b>balance</b> variables were calculated. Results showed large differences in the magnitude of soil water balance variables between different profiles. The extreme difference in the water storage in 1 m depth soil during the winter wheat growth varied with time between 175 mm and 180 mm, which accounted for 86. 5 - 135. 0 % of the mean of the soil water storage. This indicates that the soil water balance variables derived from only a few soil profiles are not representative for the situation of <b>field</b> water <b>balance</b> in the entire region.

40|$|Several {{researchers}} have proposed many methods for balancing the rotor {{to reduce the}} machine vibration. Broadly these methods can be categorized into two classes – balancing using measured responses only (known as Influence Coefficient Method) Approach), and balancing using both measured responses and a mathematical (often finite element (FE)) model of rotating machine (Modal Balancing Method). Both of these methods require several trial run-down runs of machine to estimate the unbalance masses and phases at multi balancing plane and usually a substantial experience in <b>field</b> <b>balancing</b> is also required. In addition to this for Modal Balancing a reliable model of the machine is also important which {{is often difficult to}} construct. Considering these practical difficulties a method has been developed recently which found to have the potential for fast and reliable rotor unbalance estimation. The method just uses measured pedestal vibration from a single run-down of a machine along with a priori models of the rotor and fluid bearings but the method accounts for the dynamics of the foundation. The method has been qualified on an experimental rotating rig and now the sensitivity analysis has been carried out and presented here for the proposed method with the perturbation errors in the rotor and fluid bearing models to confirm the robustness of the method. 1...|$|E

40|$|Harmonic {{vibrations}} {{of high-speed}} rotors in momentum exchange devices are primary disturbances for attitude control of spacecraft. Active magnetic bearings (AMBs), offering {{the ability to}} control the AMB-rotor dynamic behaviors, are preferred in high-precision and micro-vibration applications, such as high-solution Earth observation satellites. However, undesirable harmonic displacements, currents, and vibrations also occur in the AMB-rotor system owing to the mixed rotor imbalances and sensor runout. To compensate the rotor imbalances and to suppress the harmonic vibrations, two control methods are presented. Firstly, a four degrees-of-freedom AMB-rotor model with the static imbalance, dynamic imbalance, and the sensor runout are described. Next, a synchronous current reduction approach with a variable-phase notch feedback is proposed, so that the rotor imbalances can be identified on-line through the analysis of the synchronous displacement relationships of the geometric, inertial, and rotational axes of the rotor. Then, the identified rotor imbalances, which can be represented at two prescribed balancing planes of the rotor, are compensated by discrete add-on weights whose masses are calculated in the vector form. Finally, a repetitive control algorithm is utilized to suppress the residual harmonic vibrations. The proposed <b>field</b> <b>balancing</b> and harmonic vibration suppression strategies are verified by simulations and experiments performed on a control moment gyro test rig with a rigid AMB-rotor system. Compared with existing methods, the proposed strategies do not require trial weights or an accurate model of the AMB-rotor system.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{this thesis is about}} the {{balancing}} of large flexible rotors which exhibit mixed modal characteristics. The objective of the research was to develop a balancing procedure to determine correction masses without trial runs. This required the determination of(a) the modal vibration vectors for each resonance, (b) the modal damping ratios,(c) the mode shapes and(d) the equivalent mass of the rotor for each mode. It was made clear from the beginning that trial runs are unavoidable either, when the mode shapes cannot be determined using an analytical or numerical method, or when there is dual vibration at normal operating speed, produced by the influence of higher unbalanced modes, is too high to allow continuous operation of the machine. Therefore, the scope of the project was limited to the possible determination of correction masses without trial runs for the vibration modes included within the normal operating range. Some studies about the minimisation or complete elimination of trial runs have been published by several authors, but a literature search revealed no reports of systematic application of these procedures to <b>field</b> <b>balancing</b> of large turbo generators. This suggested that some practical difficulties had still to be overcome, opening the possibility for further research on this area. Analysis of the rotor response demonstrated the necessity of considering the angular position of the transducers when registering the rotor vibration. It was shown that measuring in a direction other than those of the principal axes of stiffness introduces errors when determining the magnitude and phase of the correction masses. That is to say, failing to consider the effects of the transducer angular position eliminates the possibility of balancing the rotor without trial runs. This {{is the first time that}} this problem has been recognised. The procedure developed was verified using an experimental rotor rig. The successful application of the procedure to the balancing of this rotor demonstrates that balancing withouttrialrunsisnotonlyatheoreticalbutalsoapracticalpossibility. The dynamic characteristics of the rotor rig, however, were some what limited and did not cover all the possibilities considered during the project. Therefore, a more complete numerical example was also successfully solved using the computer model of a rotor with characteristics similar to those of a real turbine, and whose unbalanced distribution was not initially known by this author...|$|E
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado a la International Conference on Hunting for Sustainability: "Ecology, Economics and Society", celebrada en Ciudad Real (España) del 27 al 29 {{de marzo de}} 2012. The use of agrochemicals is {{suspected}} {{to be a major}} cause of population declines of farmland birds from Western Europe. Apart from indirect effects like reduction of available food and optimal habitat, ingestion of pesticide-coated seeds constitute a potential way of direct intoxication. Although the most toxic chemicals are being legally restricted, some of the pesticides currently used for seed coating can cause adverse effects when consumed by birds. The use of coated seeds is a widespread practice, and cereal seeds consitute a major portion of partridge diet during autumn and winter, when alternative food sources are scarce. On the other hand, colour, taste or texture of the coat can make seeds unpalatable for birds, reducing the risk of ingestion. The aim of the present study is to assess the effects of coated seed ingestion by red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) on individual level and population viability. The first phase of the project consisted in the experimental exposure to five currently used chemicals, two insecticides (imidacloprid and natural pyrethrins) and three fungicides (difenoconazole, maneb and thiram). The second phase consists in the assessment of the environemntal exposure of partridges to coated seeds. We report deleterious effects of some of these chemicals on survival, mass and body condition, immune response and metabolism. Several reproductive parameters such as fecundation rate and chick immunocompetence and survival were affected by parental exposure to some of the tested pesticides. Difenoconazole and natural pyrethrins were the less toxic compounds within each kind of pesticide, so it would be recommendable to use them as alternatives to the most toxic compounds when possible. Experimental assessment of food choice revealed that, while some pesticides such as thiram had a repellent effect, the more toxic imidacloprid was not actively rejected by partriges, thus being potentially eaten by animals in the <b>field.</b> <b>Balancing</b> the risks and advatanges of seed coating is a necessary issue in which interests of farmers, hunters and conservationists meet.
