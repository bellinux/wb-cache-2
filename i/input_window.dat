50|$|To {{perform a}} measurement, the cuvette {{is filled with}} the liquid to be {{investigated}} and then illuminated with a laser focused through one of the cuvette’s faces. A lens is placed in line with one of the faces of the cuvette located at 90° from the <b>input</b> <b>window</b> to collect the laser-induced fluorescent light. Only a small volume of the cuvette is actually illuminated by the laser and produces a detectable spectroscopic emission. The output signal is significantly reduced because the lens picks up only about 10% of the spectroscopic emission due to solid angle considerations. This technique has been used for at least 75 years; even before the laser existed, when conventional light sources were used to excite the fluorescence.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} create a {{document}} in LaTeX, you first write a file, say , using your preferred text editor. Then you give your [...] file as input to the TeX program (with the LaTeX macros loaded), and TeX writes out a file suitable for viewing onscreen or printing. [...] This write-format-preview cycle is one of the chief ways in which working with LaTeX differs from what-you-see-is-what-you-get word-processing. It is similar to the code-compile-execute cycle familiar to computer programmers. Today, many LaTeX-aware editing programs make this cycle a simple matter of pressing a single key, while showing the output preview on the screen beside the <b>input</b> <b>window.</b> Some online LaTeX editors automatically refresh the preview. Other online tools provide incremental editing in-place, mixed in with the preview in a streamlined single window.|$|E
5000|$|An {{x-ray image}} {{intensifier}} (XRII) {{is an image}} intensifier that converts x-rays into visible light at higher intensity than mere fluorescent screens do. Such intensifiers are used in x-ray imaging systems (such as fluoroscopes [...] ) to allow low-intensity x-rays to be converted to a conveniently bright visible light output. The device contains a low absorbency/scatter <b>input</b> <b>window,</b> typically aluminum, input fluorescent screen, photocathode, electron optics, output fluorescent screen and output window. These parts are all mounted in a high vacuum environment within glass or more recently, metal/ceramic. By its intensifying effect, It allows the viewer to more easily see {{the structure of the}} object being imaged than fluorescent screens alone, whose images are dim. The X-ray II requires lower absorbed doses due to more efficient conversion of x-ray quanta to visible light. This device was originally introduced in 1948.|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{characterize}} {{and contrast}} {{the capabilities of}} the general class of time-delay neural networks (TDNN), with input delay neural networks (IDNN), the subclass of TDNNs with delays limited to the inputs. Each class of networks is capable of representing the same set of languages, those embodied by the definite memory machines (DMM), a subclass of finite state machines. We demonstrate the close affinity between TDNNs and DMM languages by learning a very large DMM (2048 states) using only a few training examples. Even though both architectures are capable of representing the same class of languages, they have distinguishable learning biases. Intuition suggests that general TDNNs which include delays in hidden layers should perform well, compared to IDNNs, on problems in which the output can be expressed as a function on narrow <b>input</b> <b>windows</b> which repeat in time. On the other hand, these general TDNNs should perform poorly when the <b>input</b> <b>windows</b> are wide, or there is little r [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} a large body of {{literature}} on research into colour in human-computer interaction, {{the overwhelming majority of the}} literature emphasises the cognition by computer users. However, colour is also important in this interaction when users manually type data into a computer. This paper investigates the effect of colour combinations on manual data typing. To this end, three experiments were conducted where the subjects were requested to read several texts with different colour combinations and re-type them in the same screen. Typing accuracy and speed is measured as the dependent variable across different colour combinations. Three experiments were conducted as such. In the first experiment, display and <b>input</b> <b>windows</b> were close to each other and in the second one they were located in the opposite ends of the screen. The third experiment was a subset of the first one with reversed foreground and background colours. It was found that different colour combinations had varying effects on data typing performance and proximity of the display and <b>input</b> <b>windows</b> was not a significant factor for typing accuracy in a 17 -inch screen. The effect of reversing the foreground and background colours was inconclusive with the colour combinations used...|$|R

40|$|The {{creation}} of a predictive system that correctly forecasts future changes of a stock price is crucial for investment management and algorithmic trading. The use of technical analysis for financial forecasting has been successfully employed by many researchers. <b>Input</b> <b>window</b> length is a time frame parameter required to be set when calculating many technical indicators.

About 2 {{years ago we}} started a program with the PMT manufacturers Hamamatsu, Photonis and Electron Tubes for boosting up the QE of bialkali PMTs. In the mean time we have obtained several batches of experimental PMTs from the above-mentioned manufacturers and measured few samples with QE values as high as 32 – 36 % in the peak.

The results affirm that it is unnecessary to use multi-layer feedforward networks for this special class of linear time series and that the two-layered network can be a useful forecasting alternative to the widely popular Box-Jenkins model.
