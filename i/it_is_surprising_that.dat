25|$|Bearing in mind Fillingham's {{expertise}} in these matters, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> while the enclosure map (by William Attenburrow of East Stoke, covering 769 acres or about 300 hectares), is dated 1792, the Award itself was not signed until {{as late as}} 27 June 1795.|$|E
25|$|The nursing {{environment}} {{is full of}} event-based and time-based prospective memory tasks. Simple tasks such as remembering to order a drug or calling patient's family and remembering when to switch shifts are just some examples of a nurse's reliance on prospective memory. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> not much {{research has been done}} concerning the importance of prospective memory in nurses since they face many life-threatening tasks.|$|E
25|$|Several {{times in}} the 1960s and 1970s plans were made to connect Wrzeszcz with Kokoszki and Kartuzy. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> this line was not rebuilt and electrified, as the cost was {{relatively}} modest. A more ambitious project called for a Seaside SKM that was to run from Zaspa Towarowa to Sopot, east of the existing line, to relieve pressure on the crowded (Sopot - Gdańsk) section.|$|E

25|$|All tracklaying had {{to start}} {{from one end of}} the line, to ensure the rack was {{correctly}} aligned; so although the first locomotives were delivered in July 1895 very little track was laid until August, when the two large viaducts between Llanberis and Waterfall were completed. Progress up the mountain was then quite rapid, with the locomotives being used to move materials as required. Considering the exposed location and possible effects of bad weather, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the first train reached the summit in January 1896. As the fencing and signals were not then ready, the opening was set for Easter.|$|E
25|$|Instead, {{correlations}} can be {{made between}} the number of extant gymnosperms and angiosperms. It is likely that cycad diversity was affected more by the great angiosperm radiation in the mid-Cretaceous than by extinctions. Very slow cambial growth was first used to define cycads, and because of this characteristic the group could not compete with the rapidly growing, relatively short-lived angiosperms, which now number over 250,000species, compared to the 1080remaining gymnosperms. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the cycads are still extant, having been faced with extreme competition and five major extinctions. The ability of cycads to survive in relatively dry environments where plant diversity is generally lower, may explain their long persistence and longevity.|$|E
25|$|The {{library was}} {{originally}} also the smoking room, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the original painted ceiling has survived {{and could be}} fully restored. The ceiling is heavily painted, gilded and sculptured in an eclectic manner, taking its general design from classical sources. The background is cream, but there is much use of Pompeiian red, an earth colour which gained popularity in Victorian England after the renewed excavations by Giuseppe Fiorelli in 1860. Small panels feature clearly painted classical motifs and portraits with distressed backgrounds, to look like pieces of ancient frescoes. Four medallions show the named poets Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer and Tennyson, all admired by the Romantics. All the spaces on the cream background are filled with illustrations imitating the original maiolica style, featuring stylised goats and fauns, cornucopia, grapes, birds and flowers, but also angels and putti in the centre. The decoration around the edge has a Green Man.|$|E

30|$|For the anthropometric {{data and}} the cause of death, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> persons who died from chest trauma had higher average weight than other traumas {{statistical}} significantly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> possible that the chest is a prominent and wide target area in the man with large body. On the other hand, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> the deceased who was dead from blunt force injury had lower weight than the other types of force statistical significantly. This could be because the smaller persons have a tendency to be assaulted or bullied by others (White and Mason 2012).|$|R
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{believed}} that novels should be [...] "probable" [...] and depict [...] "moderation, reason, and contentment". Thus <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> The Wrongs of Woman draws inspiration from {{works such as}} Ann Radcliffe's A Sicilian Romance (1790) and relies on gothic conventions such as the literal and figurative [...] "mansion of despair" [...] to which Maria is consigned. But it does so to demonstrate that gothic horrors are a reality for the average Englishwoman. Using elements of the gothic, Wollstonecraft can, for example, portray Maria's husband as tyrannical and married life as wretched.

500|$|The annal for 571 reads: [...] "Here Cuthwulf {{fought against}} the Britons at Bedcanford, and took four settlements: Limbury and Aylesbury, Benson and Eynsham; {{and in the same}} year he passed away." [...] Cuthwulf's {{relationship}} with Ceawlin is unknown, but the alliteration common to Anglo-Saxon royal families suggests Cuthwulf may be part of the West Saxon royal line. [...] The location of the battle itself is unidentified. [...] It has been suggested that it was Bedford, but what is known of the early history of Bedford's names, does not support this. [...] This battle is of interest because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> an area so far east should still be in Briton hands this late: there is ample archaeological evidence of early Saxon and Anglian presence in the Midlands, and historians generally have interpreted Gildas's De Excidio as implying that the Britons had lost control of this area by the mid-sixth century. [...] One possible explanation is, that this annal records a reconquest of land that was lost to the Britons in the campaigns ending in the battle of Mons Badonicus.|$|E
500|$|The poor sales caused {{financial}} problems {{and may have}} caused a suicide, for on August 22, Charles A. Watts, secretary of the Centennial Corporation and described by Campbell as the real force behind the coin, killed himself. The day before he died, he told {{a meeting of the}} corporation that there were funds enough to pay all debts, and that Fraser was not owed any money. Neither proved to be the case, and unpaid bills totaled $6,000, with no money to pay them. In fact, Fraser's fee of $1,200 was outstanding, and she tried to get paid even with the half dollars, but her bill was unsatisfied until a year later, when she was paid by check. The half dollars were not owned by the corporation, as the Vancouver National Bank had advanced money for them. Sales came to a virtual halt by the end of October. Texas coin dealer B. Max Mehl offered to buy the remainder of the issue at face value, but this was rejected as many people had paid $1 for their coins. A total of 35,034 pieces were sent back to the mint for redemption and melting, leaving 14,966 pieces outstanding. According to Swiatek and Breen, [...] "given the remoteness and exclusively local nature of the celebration, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> as many as fourteen thousand coins were sold." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rosie, a {{black and}} white {{portrait}} of a very young girl crouched down on a bench outdoors with part of her dress lifted, exposing her genitals, generated controversy because of the subject's age and the issue of consent. This photograph was deemed child pornography by Mapplethorpe's detractors, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> it was featured in the exhibition catalogue, considering that the printer had refused to print it for the Mapplethorpe retrospective at the Whitney Museum of Art in 1988.

2500|$|... saw a 'Return to Power' as Formula One {{changed the}} engine rules once again, {{allowing}} engines of 3.0-litre normally aspirated, or 1.5-litre supercharged or forced induction. 1966 was a transitional year for most teams, however, the year did {{see the first}} use of composite materials, a technology which would later revolutionise the sport. The McLaren M2B, designed by Robin Herd, used an aluminium-wood laminate known as Mallite for much of its monocoque, although the car's design did not make best use of the new material. Given the shift to 1500cc forced induction, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprising</b> <b>that</b> any teams did not seriously consider fielding turbocharged versions of their 1500cc naturally aspirated engines right from that point, Coventry Climax had considered it for their FWMW flat 16, but the company had decided to end its Formula 1 racing activities and the idea stopped there. It would be Eleven years before a team exploited the 1500cc forced induction option again.|$|E
