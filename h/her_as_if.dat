Although Dai could not speak Chinese and Ye spoke little English, {{they fell in love}} and got married within a few weeks. Soong Ching-ling, the widow of President Sun Yat-sen, presided over their wedding. Because of a botched surgery in Hong Kong, Dai was unable to have children. According to Ye Qianyu's daughter Mingming, who lived with her father and was initially hostile to her stepmother, Dai treated <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she had been her own child.|$|E

She sports a bob of blond hair; wears a distinctive white, red, and blue costume; and has an aggressive fighting style. Throughout her early appearances in All Star Comics, she is often at odds with Wildcat because his penchant for talking to <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were an ordinary human female rather than a superpowered Kryptonian annoys her.|$|E
500|$|According to Ovid, in {{the fifth}} year of Procne's {{marriage}} to Tereus, King of Thrace and son of Ares, she asked her husband to [...] "Let me at Athens my dear sister see / Or let her come to Thrace, and visit me." [...] Tereus agreed to travel to Athens and escort her sister, Philomela, to Thrace. King Pandion of Athens, the father of Philomela and Procne, was apprehensive about letting his one remaining daughter leave his home and protection and asks Tereus to protect <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were her father. Tereus agrees. However, Tereus lusted for Philomela {{when he first saw}} her, and that lust grew {{during the course of the}} return voyage to Thrace.|$|E

500|$|Mike Nichols, who {{directed}} Streep in Silkwood, Heartburn, Postcards from the Edge and Angels in America, praised Streep's ability to transform herself into her characters, remarking that [...] "in every role she becomes {{a totally new}} human being. As she becomes the person she is portraying, the other performers begin to react to <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were that person". [...] He said that directing her is [...] "so much like falling in love that it has {{the characteristics of a}} time which you remember as magical but which is shrouded in mystery". He also noted that Streep's acting ability {{had a profound impact on}} her co-stars and that [...] "one could improve by 1000% purely by watching her." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was similar}} to what Naomi Watts construed, when {{she said in an}} interview, [...] "I thought Diane was the real character and that Betty was the person she wanted to be and had dreamed up. Rita is the damsel in distress and she's in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were a doll. Rita is Betty's fantasy of who she wants Camilla to be." [...] Watts' own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane's. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, [...] "There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely." ...|$|E
500|$|Since February 2006, Lindesfarne has {{had her own}} blog titled [...] "Virtual Quill". Originally, she was posting it as a sort {{of private}} journal, using the inter{{dimension}}al portal to make sure that if it were ever seen by others, it would only be seen by humans from her native dimension (namely, our world), not the dimension she's called home {{for the vast majority of}} her life. She would post generally once a week, talking about the various events in her life and those of her friends and family, providing additional information and insights into what was shown on the strip. Many fans commented back to <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were a real person, but she couldn’t see those comments at first because her interdimensional Internet connection was one-way (write-only).|$|E

Miller is a former victim of bullying, and she became an {{advocate}} against bullying and cyberbullying on May 1, 2013, along with Super Bowl XLVII champion Jameel McClain, by becoming a global ambassador for STOMP Out Bullying. In 2013, Miller signed with IMG soon after a first public appearance with Jake Gyllenhaal. She was featured in the 80th anniversary issue of Esquire {{as one of the}} 80 things that define our time. In December 2013, she appeared on the cover and in the 2014 Calendar Girl Issue of the fashion magazine Galore. Her images were augmented by the artwork of Claw Money who affixed his graphic cartoon paws to both black-and-white and color photographs of <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were gripping her while she was modelling.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{perceived}} adversaries, Bessie showed neither patience nor respect, {{especially those}} {{with whom she had}} once shared common ground on the far left. Apart from her attacks on Bevan, she displayed particular scorn for the future Labour Party leader Michael Foot, whose practice in the 1950s of writing articles attacking the Labour leadership for right-wing newspapers was, she thought, disloyal. A much reported exchange between her and Churchill has her accusing him of being drunk, and him concurring but adding: [...] "My dear you are ugly, but tomorrow I shall be sober and you will still be ugly"—or similar words. There is no reliable evidence that any such exchange took place; despite its popularity, commentators are generally sceptical. According to the columnist Simon Hoggart, similar stories involving other figures had been circulating for years; he concluded: [...] "If it sounds true, if it echoes something we feel about the politician, then it will cling to him or <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> bonded with superglue".|$|E
500|$|Lenalee is {{introduced}} in D.Gray-mans sixth manga chapter when she shows exorcist newcomer Allen Walker the Black Order. While {{on a mission}} to slay Akumas with Allen, Lenalee explains her past. Her parents were killed by an Akuma when she was very young, and she was forced to become an Exorcist as a child. Because she was separated from her brother, Komui Lee, her only remaining family member, she tried repeatedly to escape but was restrained. As a result, she hated the Order and Innocence. When Komui joined the Order to be with her, she stopped trying to escape. She now fights for her brother as well as her friends, knowing she has a home and family to return to. Her perception of the [...] "world" [...] consists of her friends and family; whenever one of her friends dies, it seems to <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a part of her world has been destroyed. Lenalee's Innocence are the , her Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon, {{take the form of a}} pair of black, knee-high boots that give her the ability to run at high speeds, jump to great heights, walk on water, create whirlwinds and use sound waves as footholds.|$|E

500|$|Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the {{personification}} of the [...] "Ecclesia Triumphans" [...] and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found {{in a number of}} other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a [...] "throne room", which envelopes <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a [...] "carrying case". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as [...] "the Madonna in a church", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary [...] "as the Church". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.|$|E
500|$|The 15-year-old King fell {{seriously ill}} in February 1553. His sister Mary {{was invited to}} visit him, the Council doing [...] "duty and obeisance to <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she had been Queen of England". The King {{recovered}} somewhat, and in April Northumberland restored Mary's full title and arms as Princess of England, which she had lost in the 1530s. He also kept her informed about Edward's condition. About this time a set of drawn-out marriage negotiations came to conclusion. On 21 May 1553 Guildford Dudley, Northumberland's second youngest son, married Lady Jane Grey, the fervently Protestant daughter of the Duke of Suffolk and, through her mother Frances Brandon, a grandniece of Henry VIII. Her sister Catherine was matched with the heir of the Earl of Pembroke, and another Katherine, Guildford's younger sister, was promised to Henry Hastings, heir of the Earl of Huntingdon. Within a month {{the first of these}} marriages turned out to be highly significant. Although marked by magnificent festivities, at the time they took place the alliances were not seen as politically important, not even by the Imperial ambassador Jehan de Scheyfye, who was the most suspicious observer. Often perceived as proof of a conspiracy to bring the Dudley family to the throne, they have also been described as routine matches between aristocrats.|$|E
2500|$|The movie Saaz was {{supposedly}} based on Lata and Asha's rivalry. Asha {{said about the}} movie– [...] "To have two women in long plaits, {{take a couple of}} incidents and exaggerate them into a 3-hour film is such a waste of time." [...] In the last few years, Asha and Lata have often been seen in public, enjoying each other's company. In an interview with The Times of India, Asha once said– [...] "I remember, sometimes both of us would be at a function and some industry types would ignore me and interact only with <b>her,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to prove their loyalty.

First {{sightings}} seem to indicate that they are all bright-eyed innocents with bags of talent– a familiar starting point, no?" [...] She said at first she did not understand the comparisons to Dusty Springfield and believes the comparisons with others or putting her in a movement is [...] "a gimmick" [...] and noted that [...] "nobody is replaceable". Later some of Springfield's friends sought out and befriended Duffy. Duffy was quoted as saying they tell her she is much like Springfield and talk to <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were around during the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|A Ride for Liberty – The Fugitive Slaves (1862), which {{depicts a}} slave family riding at dawn to freedom, also invites interpretation. Johnson places the slave family {{squarely}} {{in the center of}} the work, acting as agents of their own destiny. It appears to be dawn and in the distance is light on bayonets, indicating Union lines. A man rides with a child in front of him; behind him, a woman holds an infant close to her chest. She looks behind <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> worried about pursuers, or wondering what she left behind. Curator Eleanor Harvey writes the painting [...] "captures the moment when the full scope of the slavery question begins to loom. Johnson placed these people {{squarely in the}} foreground and, in doing so, elevated their plight in the national debate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although general {{relativity}} {{is not required}} to analyze the twin paradox, application of the Equivalence Principle of {{general relativity}} does provide some additional insight into the subject. We had previously noted that Stella is not stationary in an inertial frame. Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. [...] When she is coasting her rest frame is inertial, and Terence's clock will appear to run slow. But when she fires her rockets for the turnaround, her rest frame is an accelerated frame and she experiences a force which is pushing <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she were in a gravitational field. Terence will appear to be high up in that field and because of gravitational time dilation, his clock will appear to run fast, {{so much so that the}} net result will be that Terence has aged more than Stella when they are back together. As will be discussed in the forthcoming section Curvature of time, the theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation are not exclusive to general relativity. Any theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the principle of equivalence, including Newton's theory.|$|E

Manrico tells Azucena that he defeated di Luna in their earlier duel, but was held back from killing him by a mysterious power (Duet: Mal reggendo / [...] "He was helpless under my savage attack"): and Azucena reproaches him for having stayed his hand then, especially since it was the Count's forces that defeated him in the subsequent battle of Pelilla. [...] A messenger arrives and reports that Manrico's allies have taken Castle Castellor, which Manrico is ordered to hold in the name of his prince: and also that Leonora, who believes Manrico dead, is about to enter a convent and take the veil that night. Although Azucena tries to prevent him from leaving in his weak state (Ferma! Son io che parlo a te! / [...] "I must talk to you"), Manrico rushes away to prevent her from carrying out this intent.|$|E
2500|$|On September 11, 2014, African-American actress Danièle Watts was {{temporarily}} detained by the LAPD {{when she and}} her boyfriend were in Studio City. Watts accused the officers who stopped her of racially profiling her because she was African-American and her boyfriend was Caucasian, claiming that they treated <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she was a [...] "prostitute" [...] and that the officers had been disrespectful to her because she was African-American. LAPD Sergeant Jim Parker {{who was one of the}} two officers accused by Watts of misconduct, released a personal audio recording of the entire incident to TMZ. The recording showed that police had received a 911 call about lewd acts in a car and the couple who were described to have committed the lewd acts fit Watts' and her boyfriend's description. It also showed that when officers arrived on the scene, Watts' boyfriend cooperated with police but Watts refused to cooperate and identify herself, accused the officers of racism, and ignored officers requests and walked away from them leading to her being handcuffed and temporarily detained. Following the release of the recording, local civil rights activists called for Watts to apologize to the LAPD for falsely accusing them of racial profiling but Watts refused. The two officers were cleared of any wrongdoing by the department shortly after the release of the audio recordings.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Zohar, Rabbi Abba {{was once}} going toward Lod {{when he met}} Rabbi Zeira, the son of Rav. [...] Quoting [...] "And he {{believed}} in the Lord, and he counted it to him for righteousness," [...] Rabbi Zeira asked whether it means that God counted it to Abraham, or that Abraham counted it to God. [...] Rabbi Zeira {{reported that he had}} heard that it means that God counted it to Abraham, but that interpretation did not satisfy him. [...] Rabbi Abba replied that it is indeed not so. [...] Noting that [...] says, [...] "and he reckoned her" [...] ( [...] , vayahsh'veha)" [...] and not [...] "and he reckoned to him ( [...] , vayahshov lo)," [...] Rabbi Abba taught that this means that Abraham counted it to God. [...] For [...] says, [...] "And he brought him forth abroad," [...] meaning that God told Abraham, in effect, to give up his astrological speculations; that was not the way to acquire knowledge of God’s Name. [...] Abram, it was true, would not beget children, but Abraham would beget children. [...] says, [...] "So ( [...] , Koh) shall your seed be." [...] The word , Koh, expresses the tenth sacred Crown of the King by which God’s Name may be known; it is the Crown through which judgments are set in motion.
