5|$|From {{this point}} on, the term 'dreadnought' became less widely used. Most pre-dreadnought battleships were {{scrapped}} or hulked after World War <b>I,</b> <b>so</b> the term 'dreadnought' became less necessary.|$|E
5|$|España {{served in}} the 1st Squadron after her commissioning, along with her two sisters. Spain {{remained}} neutral during World War <b>I,</b> <b>so</b> the Spanish fleet did not see action during the conflict. España provided gunfire support during the Rif War in the early 1920s. During these operations, she ran aground off Cape Tres Forcas, Morocco in August 1923. The Navy was unable to raise the ship, and severe storms destroyed the wreck in 1924, which led the Navy to abandon her.|$|E
5|$|Progress on {{the section}} from Paddington to Queen's Park was slowed by {{the start of}} World War <b>I,</b> <b>so</b> the line was not {{finished}} until early 1915. As at Paddington, the three below-ground stations were built to use escalators. Maida Vale and Kilburn Park were provided with buildings {{in the style of the}} earlier Leslie Green stations but without the upper storey, which was no longer required for housing lift gear. Warwick Avenue was accessed from a subway under the street. The LNWR rebuilt Queen's Park station with additional platforms for the Bakerloo Tube's and its own electric services and constructed two train sheds for rolling stock, one each side of the station.|$|E

5|$|The UERL {{struggled}} financially in {{the first}} years after the opening of its lines and narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 1908 by restructuring its debt. A policy of expansion by acquisition was followed before World War <b>I,</b> <b>so</b> that the company came to operate the majority of the underground railway lines in and around London. It also controlled large bus and tram fleets, the profits from which subsidised the financially weaker railways. After the war, railway extensions took the UERL's services out into suburban areas to stimulate additional passenger numbers, so that, by the early 1930s, the company's lines stretched beyond the County of London and served destinations in Middlesex, Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey.|$|E
5|$|Baden-Powell {{could not}} single-handedly advise all groups who {{requested}} his assistance. Early Scoutmaster training camps {{were held in}} London and Yorkshire in 1910 and 1911. Baden-Powell wanted the training to be as practical as possible to encourage other adults to take leadership roles, so the Wood Badge course was developed to recognize adult leadership training. The development of the training was delayed by World War <b>I,</b> <b>so</b> the first Wood Badge course was not held until 1919. Wood Badge is used by Boy Scout associations and combined Boy Scout and Girl Guide associations in many countries. Gilwell Park near London was purchased in 1919 on behalf of The Scout Association as an adult training site and Scouting campsite. Baden-Powell wrote a book, Aids to Scoutmastership, to help Scouting Leaders, and wrote other handbooks {{for the use of}} the new Scouting sections, such as Cub Scouts and Girl Guides. One of these was Rovering to Success, written for Rover Scouts in 1922. A wide range of leader training exists in 2007, from basic to program-specific, including the Wood Badge training.|$|E

25|$|The borough {{was first}} enfranchised in 1300, but only {{seems to have}} sent burgesses to Parliament for a short time. By 1307 {{it was no longer}} {{included}} in the list of Parliamentary boroughs. In the 17th century a solicitor named William Hakewill, of Lincoln's Inn, rediscovered ancient writs confirming that Amersham, Great Marlow, and Wendover had all sent members to Parliament in the past, and succeeded in re-establishing their privileges (despite the opposition of James <b>I),</b> <b>so</b> that they resumed electing members from the Parliament of 1624. Hakewill himself was elected for Amersham in 1624.|$|E
25|$|On June 22, 2016, guitarist Williamson made an {{official}} statement {{for the band}} saying that the Stooges are no more."The Stooges is over.

That doesn't make any sense to me."Williamson also added that touring had become boring, and trying to balance the band's career as well as Pop's was a difficult task.|$|E

25|$|The Imperial German Navy only {{carried out}} 12 bombardments of British coastal targets during World War <b>I,</b> <b>so</b> {{most of the}} {{extensive}} coastal defences were never tested. Many of the trained men in these defences were transferred to meet the desperate need for heavy and siege gun units overseas, particularly on the Western Front. Kent was, however, {{an exception to the}} inactivity, and the ports of Margate, Broadstairs, Ramsgate and Dover were bombarded in April 1917 (the Second Battle of the Dover Strait), and Dover was shelled again (the last such bombardment of the war) on 16 February 1918. The batteries at Ramsgate and Dover were engaged on these occasions.|$|E
25|$|Pedro I's abdication {{resulted}} in {{the reduction of the}} size of the Army contingent. The liberals were against the Army for ideological and economic reasons. Their objective was to prevent any possibility of return to Brazil by Pedro <b>I,</b> <b>so</b> they weakened one of the institutions most connected to the former Emperor. Some battalions were dissolved while others were transferred to distant provinces. Most of the soldiers were discharged; enlistment was suspended and the promotion of any officer was forbidden. On 30 August 1831, the liberal regency reduced the Army to fewer than 10,000 men. Later reductions left only 6,000 soldiers. The battalions formed by mercenaries were also disbanded.|$|E

500|$|A {{first for}} any British {{dreadnought}} {{was the use}} of the all or nothing protection scheme in the G3s.
