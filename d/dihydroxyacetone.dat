5|$|Another {{approach}} ignores {{energy and}} deals {{only with the}} molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, <b>dihydroxyacetone,</b> uracil, cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into {{the range of the}} values typical for the known interstellar molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally the molecules with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the molecules with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene molecules supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of interstellar entities: the molecules with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.|$|E

This is advantageous, as it directs <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> phosphate {{down the same}} pathway as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, simplifying regulation.|$|E
25|$|Examples of aldol {{reactions}} in biochemistry include the splitting of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate {{in the fourth}} stage of glycolysis, which {{is an example of}} a reverse ("retro") aldol reaction catalyzed by the enzyme aldolase A (also known as fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase).|$|E

25|$|The {{glycerol}} {{released by}} lipase action is phosphorylated by glycerol kinase {{in the liver}} (the only tissue in which this reaction can occur), and the resulting glycerol 3-phosphate is oxidized to <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> phosphate.

25|$|Destabilizing the {{molecule}} {{in the previous}} reaction allows the hexose ring to be split by aldolase into two triose sugars: <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> phosphate (a ketose), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (an aldose). There are two classes of aldolases: class I aldolases, present in animals and plants, and class II aldolases, present in fungi and bacteria; the two classes use different mechanisms in cleaving the ketose ring.|$|E
25|$|Glycolysis is a {{determined}} sequence of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The intermediates provide entry points to glycolysis. For example, most monosaccharides, such as fructose and galactose, {{can be converted}} to one of these intermediates. The intermediates may also be directly useful. For example, the intermediate <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> phosphate (DHAP) is a source of the glycerol that combines with fatty acids to form fat.|$|E
25|$|The {{synthesis}} of bacterial cellulose is a multistep process that involve two main mechanisms: the {{synthesis of}} uridine diphosphoglucose (UDPGIc), followed by the polymerization of glucose into long and unbranched chains (the β-1→4 glucan chain). Specifics on the cellulose synthesis has been extensively documented. The former mechanism is well known while the latter still needs exploring. The production of UDPGIc starts with carbon compounds (such as hexoses, glycerol, <b>dihydroxyacetone,</b> pyruvate, and dicarboxylic acids) entering the Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, or the pentose phosphate cycle depending on what carbon source is available. It then goes through phosphorylation along with catalysis, followed by isomerization of the intermediate, and {{a process known as}} UDPGIc pyrophosphorylase to convert the compounds into UDPGIc, a precursor to the production of cellulose. The polymerization of glucose into the β-1→4 glucan chain has been hypothesized to either involve a lipid intermediate or not to involve a lipid intermediate, though structural enzymology studies and in vitro experiments indicate that polymerization can occur by direct enzymatic transfer of a glucosyl moiety from a nucleotide sugar to the growing polysaccharide. A. xylinum usually converts carbon compounds into cellulose with around 50% efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} {{regulated}} step (the third step of glycolysis), phosphofructokinase converts fructose-6-phosphate into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, which then is converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> phosphate.

2500|$|Monosaccharides are the {{simplest}} carbohydrates {{in that they}} cannot be hydrolyzed to smaller carbohydrates. They are aldehydes or ketones with two or more hydroxyl groups.

2500|$|Step 5 in {{the figure}} is shown behind the other steps, because that step is a {{side-reaction}} that can decrease or increase the concentration of the intermediate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

2500|$|The {{glycerol}} {{released into}} the blood during the lipolysis of triglycerides in adipose tissue can only be {{taken up by the}} liver. Here it is converted into glycerol 3-phosphate by the action of glycerol kinase which hydrolyzes one molecule of ATP per glycerol molecule which is phosphorylated. Glycerol 3-phosphate is then oxidized to <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> phosphate, which is, in turn, converted into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by the enzyme triose phosphate isomerase. From here the three carbon atoms of the original glycerol can be [...] oxidized via glycolysis, or converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis.|$|E
2500|$|Firstly, the [...] NADH + H+ {{generated}} by glycolysis {{has to be}} transferred to the mitochondrion to be oxidized, and thus to regenerate the NAD+ necessary for glycolysis to continue. However the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. [...] Use is therefore made of two “shuttles” to transport the electrons from NADH across the mitochondrial membrane. They are the malate-aspartate shuttle and the glycerol phosphate shuttle. In the former the electrons from NADH are transferred to cytosolic oxaloacetate to form malate. The malate then traverses the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is reoxidized by NAD+ forming intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate and NADH. The oxaloacetate is then re-cycled to the cytosol via its conversion to aspartate which is readily transported out of the mitochondrion. In the glycerol phosphate shuttle electrons from cytosolic NADH are transferred to <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> to form glycerol-3-phosphate which readily traverses the outer mitochondrial membrane. Glycerol-3-phosphate is then reoxidized to <b>dihydroxyacetone,</b> donating its electrons to FAD instead of NAD+. This reaction takes place on the inner mitochondrial membrane, allowing FADH2 to donate its electrons directly to coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) {{which is part of the}} electron transport chain which ultimately transfers electrons to molecular oxygen (O2), with the formation of water, and the release of energy eventually captured in the form of ATP.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{production}} of alcohol is the most noteworthy by-product of yeast metabolism from a winemaking perspective, {{there are a number}} of other products that yeast produce that can be also influence the resulting wine. This includes glycerol which is produced when an intermediate of the glycolysis cycle (<b>dihydroxyacetone)</b> is reduced to [...] "recharge" [...] the NADH enzyme needed to continue other metabolic activities. This is usually produced early in the fermentation process before the mechanisms to reduce acetaldehyde into ethanol to recharge NADH becomes the cell's primary means of maintaining redox balance. As glycerol contributes increased body and a slightly sweet taste without increasing the alcohol level of the wine, some winemakers try to intentionally favor conditions that would promote glycerol production in wine. This includes selecting yeast strains that favor glycerol production (or allowing some wild yeast like Kloeckera and Metschnikowia to ferment), increased oxygen exposure and aeration as well as fermenting at higher temperatures. Glycerol production is also encouraged if most available acetaldehyde is made unavailable by binding with bisulfite molecules in the wine, but it would take a substantial amount of sulfur dioxide addition (far beyond legal limits) to prolong glycerol production beyond just these very nascent stages of fermentation.|$|E

50|$|When {{pyruvate}} of lactate {{is used as}} {{the precursor}} for glycerol 3-phosphate, glyceroneogenesis follows exactly the same pathway as gluconeogenesis until it generates <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> phosphate. Lactate catalysed by lactate dehydrogenase will form pyruvate with expense of NAD+. Furthermore, by using 1 ATP and bicarbonate, pyruvate will be converted to oxaloacetate. which is catalysed by pyruvate carboxylase. Oxaloacetate will be catalysed by PEPC-K to generate phosphoenolpyruvate. This phosphorylation and decarboxylation of oxaloacetate is the significant step in glyceroneogenesis because the entire pathway is regulated by this reaction. After the production of phosphoenolpyruvate, gluconeogenesis will continue until <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> phosphate is generated, which produces 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as intermediates. When <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> phosphate is produced, glyceroneogenesis will branch off from gluconeogenesis. With expense of NADH, <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> phosphate will convert to glycerol 3- phosphate (Figure 4), which is the final product of glyceroneogenesis. In addition, triglyceride can be generated by re-esterification of 3 fatty acid chains on glycerol 3-phosphate. Therefore, glyceroneogenesis is a metabolic pathway starting from lactate or pyruvate, and it is similar to gluconeogenesis but the pathway will branch out when <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> phosphate is generated. Instead of producing fructose 1,6- bisphosphate as gluconeogenesis does, glyceroneogenesis converts <b>dihydroxyacetone</b> phosphate to glycerol 3-phosphate.|$|E
