40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Force</b> <b>display</b> {{systems are}} {{important}} in virtual reality and other applications. While conventional <b>force</b> <b>displays</b> are active systems with actuators and as such may become inherently dangerous, passive <b>force</b> <b>displays</b> are effective methods for assuring safety. In this paper, we developed a brake using electrorheological (ER) fluid, and showed a passive <b>force</b> <b>display</b> system using ER brakes with two degrees of freedom. We also discuss basic control experiments of the system. Key Words: passive <b>force</b> <b>display,</b> brake, ER fluid, haptic interface, mechatronic...|$|R
40|$|In human-scale {{virtual reality}} {{environment}} or augmented reality environment, force feedback plays important roll, {{as well as}} visual feedback. In such situation, <b>force</b> <b>display</b> requires large working volume {{and the ability to}} move easily. To satisfy these requirements, we 2 ̆ 7 ve developed a non-grounded <b>force</b> <b>display</b> using gyro-moment effect. We measured various characteristics,such as the threshold, the differential threshold. And we propose some techniques to indicate the information of territories or direction by using the <b>force</b> <b>display.</b> The effectiveness of this <b>force</b> <b>display</b> tested through some experiments and two applications...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the design and the implementation ofa <b>force</b> <b>display</b> for immersive projection displays such as CAVE or CABIN. To give the user maximum freedom of motion in a large virtual space, {{it is necessary to}} use a portable <b>force</b> <b>display</b> that is grounded on the user 2 ̆ 7 s body. Various nonportable <b>force</b> <b>displays</b> have been developed, but their workspace is small and restricted. Therefore, we developed a portable (wearable) <b>force</b> <b>display</b> called HapticGEAR which makes use of the tension of wires grounded on the user 2 ̆ 7 s back. HapticGEAR is designed to have fewer effects on the user 2 ̆ 7 s motion and to maximize output force in user 2 ̆ 7 s workspace. Finally, we evaluated this device through the basic experiments in CABIN...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{existing}} knowledge on human movement perception we constructed {{a prototype of}} a novel multi-pin Shear <b>Force</b> <b>Display</b> (SFD). Two experiments, presented in this article, focus {{on the question of}} whether the prototype SFD generates tactile stimulation that is appropriate for the sensitivity of human tactile perception. In particular, Experiment I studied human resolution for distinguishing between different directions of pin movement and Experiment II explored the perceptual integration of multi-pin movements. Both experiments demonstrated that humans can well discriminate between directions of the shear <b>forces</b> <b>displayed,</b> and also that technically realized resolution of the device exceeds the perceptual resolution (> 14 °). In Experiment II we further found evidence that the human brain does not process stimulation from the different pins of the SFD independent of another at least concerning movement direction. The acquired psychophysical knowledge based on this new technology will in return be used to improve the design of the shear <b>force</b> <b>display.</b> Categories and Subject Descriptors: H 1. 2 [Models and Principles]: User/Machine Systems – Huma...|$|R
