5000|$|Tennessee courts {{may issue}} a writ of coram nobis only for {{subsequently}} or {{newly discovered evidence}} relating to matters which were litigated at the trial if the judge determines that such evidence may {{have resulted in a}} different judgment had it been presented at the trial. The Supreme Court of Tennessee provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Tennessee (Citations and quotes removed):Starting in the early 1800’s, the writ of coram nobis was recognized and utilized under the common law in Tennessee. The writ was used primarily in civil cases — similar {{to the use of the}} writ in other states. The writ was also available in criminal actions in Tennessee, although rarely sought.In 1858, the Tennessee General Assembly enacted a statute which codified the procedure for seeking the writ of coram nobis, expanded the grounds upon which a claim for relief under the writ could be based, and placed a time limitation upon its filings which provided that the writ of coram nobis may be had within one year from the rendition of the judgment. Both at common law and under the 1858 statutory enactment, however, the writ of coram nobis was limited in scope to civil proceedings.In 1955 the General Assembly extended the writ of coram nobis to criminal proceedings. The relief available extended only to [...] "errors dehors the record and to matters that were not or could not have been litigated on the trial of the case, on a motion for a new trial, on appeal in the nature of a writ of error, on writ of error, or in a habeas corpus proceeding." [...] The statute provided only that criminal coram nobis proceedings were to be governed by the same rules and procedure applicable to the writ of coram nobis in civil cases.Though the writ of coram nobis in civil cases was superseded when Rule 60 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure became effective in 1971, the adoption of Rule 60 did not supersede the statute which extended the writ as an available remedy in criminal proceedings. Indeed, currently provides as follows::Upon a showing by the defendant that the defendant was without fault in failing to present certain evidence at the proper time, a writ of coram nobis will lie for subsequently or newly discovered evidence relating to matters which were litigated at the trial if the judge determines that such evidence may have resulted in a different judgment, had it been presented at the trial.Before granting a writ of coram nobis, the trial court must be satisfied with the reliability of the newly discovered evidence and determine that the defendant is without fault in timely discovering such evidence. The trial court must then review the evidence presented at trial and at the coram nobis proceeding and determine whether a reasonable basis exists for concluding that had the new evidence been presented at trial, the result of the proceedings might have been different. Coram nobis claims are not easily resolved on the face of the petition and often require a hearing; however, an evidentiary hearing is not statutorily required in every case. [...] The decision whether to grant or deny a petition for writ of coram nobis lies within the discretionary authority of the trial court. The writ of coram nobis is not available for attacking a guilty plea. If appealed, the appellate courts review such the decision for an abuse of discretion.

However, the overall mechanics is complicated and special conditions, such as bending under tension, cyclic bending & unbending, and shear deformation occur during the process which contribute to the overall enhancement of formability. The research investigates the deformation mechanisms in ISF with relation to necking and failure. A strain-based forming limit criterion is widely used in sheet-metal forming industry to predict necking. However, this criterion is strictly valid only when the strain path is linear throughout the deformation process.

However, conventional cephalometric analysis cannot evaluate the effects on maxillary growth by separating sutural growth and changes in maxillary morphology derived from periosteal growth, because external anatomical points of the maxilla (e.g., point A, anterior nasal spine (ANS)) depend on local surface remodeling processes and may lead to <b>erroneous</b> <b>assessment</b> regarding maxillary growth [14].

30|$|State {{estimator}} {{is one of}} the key {{applications in}} energy management system (EMS). It serves as a vital module that validates the raw measurements from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and provides current system states for downstream applications in EMS [1, 2, 3]. Applications such as contingency analysis, voltage stability analysis, transient stability analysis, system alarming, unit commitment, are critical to provide power system operators situational awareness and useful control applications to manage the grid reliability. During a system event, operators need to monitor system vulnerability, diagnose the cause of event and take corrective actions based on such tools. Typically, iterative methods are used in a conventional state estimator, which uses the previous operating condition as the initial point for the next solution. However, a state estimator may not converge, especially during the stressed condition or system experiencing contingencies when the state estimator results are needed the most. Moreover, incorrect or biased estimates are more likely to occur when the system is overloading. As a result, even when the state estimator converges, <b>erroneous</b> <b>assessment</b> of the system state may be obtained [4].|$|E

The recent development of second generation contrast echocardiography agents such as SonoVue has resulted in several studies showing {{the value of these}} agents to outline endocardium dearly, thereby improving assessment of LV function. The use of these contrast agents has also opened the possibility of automated and quantitative LV function assessment, making it more accurate and reproducible. Other major clinical uses of these contrast agents are evaluation of LV masses such as thrombus and tumors, and better definition of LV structure such as delineating LV aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm; and non-compaction of LV and apical cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, the use of these contrast agents during stress not only improved the assessment of watt motion but also made possible the evaluation of myocardial perfusion, thereby increasing diagnostic accuracy for the detection of coronary artery disease. © 2005 The European Society of Cardiology.

To investigate this phenomenon in more detail and assess the impact of arbitrary tilted resistivity anisotropy on CSEM data, we performed simulations for a set of 3 D tilted transverse isotropic (TTI) and VTI benchmark models. The 3 D modeling results show that ignoring the TTI effect, if it is present, might lead to incorrect assessment of the feasibility of a potential CSEM survey as well as <b>erroneous</b> <b>assessments</b> and /or mispositioning of hydrocarbon targets during interpretation of field data and, in turn, might compromise the reliability of marine CSEM technology.

40|$|Seabird {{abundance}} is {{an important}} indicator for assessing impact of human activities on the marine environment. However, data collection at sea is time consuming and surveys are carried out over several consecutive days for efficiency reasons. This study investigates the validity of aggregating those data over time to estimate a spatial variogram that is representative for spatial correlation in species abundance. For this purpose we simulate four-day surveys of seabird count data that contain spatial and temporal correlation arising from temporal changes in the spatial pattern of environmental conditions. Estimates of the aggregated spatial variogram are compared to a variogram that would arise when data were collected over a single day. The study reveals that, under changing environmental conditions over surveys days, aggregating data over a four-day survey increases both the non-spatial variation in the data and the scale of spatial correlation in seabird data. Next, the effect of using an aggregated variogram on the statistical power to test the significance of an impact is investigated. The impact concerns a case of establishing an offshore wind farm resulting in seabird displacement. The study shows that both overestimation and underestimation of statistical power occurs, with power estimates differing up to a factor of two. We conclude that the spatial variation in seabird abundance can be misrepresented by using temporally aggregated data. In impact studies, such misrepresentation can lead to <b>erroneous</b> <b>assessments</b> {{of the ability to}} detect impact...|$|R
