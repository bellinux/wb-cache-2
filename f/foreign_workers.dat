Wages for <b>foreign</b> <b>workers</b> vary, depending on the position, although in general Saudis holding similar positions earn more.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, blue collar <b>foreign</b> <b>workers</b> have {{sometimes}} {{been unable to}} collect salaries due even when the Saudi Labor Office has ruled in their favor, since employers can stall payment until the worker' work permits have expired.|$|E
5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on <b>foreign</b> <b>workers</b> {{has been a}} concern to the Saudi government since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been blamed on the Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis on religion and rote learning. The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing <b>foreign</b> <b>workers</b> with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. In the private sector, there has been a reluctance to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} options {{available}} to US employers who wish to hire <b>foreign,</b> non-immigrant <b>workers</b> on a temporary but long-term basis: H-1B visas, L-1 visas, TN status and other options. These temporary options are often sufficient {{to meet the needs}} of employer and employee. When a US employer wishes to hire the services of the <b>foreign</b> <b>worker</b> on a permanent basis, however, a complex sponsorship process for the green card begins, a process that can take years. [...] Generally (although not always) the first step in that process is labor certification. Labor certification is a process of proving that there are no qualified US workers for the position being offered. If there are qualified US workers - in fact, even generally speaking if there are even minimally qualified US workers - then the <b>foreign</b> <b>worker</b> cannot be offered the position on a permanent basis. This does not necessarily mean that the <b>foreign</b> <b>worker</b> will be immediately replaced by a qualified US <b>worker,</b> though. The <b>foreign</b> <b>worker</b> can still serve out the remainder of their existing US temporary visa, and may well be able to re-apply for labor certification and be approved. But it does create a substantial inconvenience for the US employer who wishes to hire a <b>foreign</b> <b>worker,</b> which does provide some protection to US workers, although the process is controversial.|$|R

5|$|By January 1943, Himmler {{reported}} that 629,000 ethnic Germans had been resettled; however, most resettled Germans {{did not live}} in the envisioned small farms, but in temporary camps or quarters in towns. Half a million residents of the annexed Polish territories, {{as well as from}} Slovenia, Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg were deported to the General Government or sent to Germany as slave labour. Himmler instructed that the German nation should view all <b>foreign</b> <b>workers</b> brought to Germany as a danger to their German blood. In accordance with German racial laws, sexual relations between Germans and foreigners were forbidden as Rassenschande (race defilement).|$|E

According to journalist Annick Cojean and psychologist Seham Sergewa, Gaddafi and senior officials raped and imprisoned hundreds or thousands of young women and reportedly raped several of his female bodyguards. Gaddafi's actions in promoting foreign militant groups, although regarded by him as a justifiable support for national liberation movements, was seen by the United States as interference in the domestic affairs of other nations and active support for international terrorism.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November, it was {{announced}} that the families of each victim of the fire would receive 960,000 yuan in compensation for the ordeal. The compensation would include 650,000 yuan for every death and 310,000 yuan in financial assistance from the government and charities. Zhang Renliang, the top official of Jing'an District, said that Shanghai residents and <b>foreign</b> <b>workers</b> would be compensated equally. Survivors of the blaze would be fully compensated for the loss of possessions and property. Some who lost relatives in the disaster, however, were not satisfied with the announcement. They said that the compensation plan was not enough to pay for another apartment in the district, and that they would rather have a new apartment than the money.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian Bureau of Statistics {{forecast}} {{that the}} population may shrink to 3.1million by 2051, depending on actual birth rate {{and the level of}} net migration. The population of Croatia rose steadily from 2.1million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7million, with exception of censuses taken in 1921 and 1948, i.e. following two world wars. The natural growth rate of the population is currently negative with the demographic transition completed in the 1970s. In recent years, the Croatian government has been pressured each year to add 40% to work permit quotas for <b>foreign</b> <b>workers.</b> In accordance with its immigration policy, Croatia is trying to entice emigrants to return.|$|E

40|$|Assuming a two-country economy where {{nominal wages}} are {{determined}} by the efficiency wage hypothesis, we investigate how changes in the monetary policies affect the domestic economy and international migration of labor in order to infer how <b>foreign</b> <b>worker</b> inflow or domestic worker outflow are related to expansion or contraction of the domestic economy. For this purpose, we assume that the workers move between the home and foreign countries due to differences in the expected lifetime utilities of the two countries. We show that increases in the nominal money stock do not necessarily increase <b>foreign</b> <b>worker</b> inflow, although they always augment domestic employment and domestic income. Specifically, increases in the nominal money stock lead to larger <b>foreign</b> <b>worker</b> inflow if migration is very responsive to differences in the expected lifetime utilities, whereas they result to larger domestic worker outflow if migration is less responsive. This is because if migration is very responsive (less responsive), the consumer price index in the country where the nominal money stock is expanded becomes relatively lower (higher), leading to the relatively higher (lower) lifetime utility in that country. We can infer from our results that expansion of the domestic economy does not necessarily lead to increases in <b>foreign</b> <b>worker</b> inflow...|$|R

5|$|The Nazi regime {{promoted}} a liberal {{code of conduct}} regarding sexual matters and was sympathetic to women who bore children out of wedlock. Promiscuity increased as the war progressed, with unmarried soldiers often intimately involved with several women simultaneously. The same {{was the case for}} married women, who liaised with soldiers, civilians or slave labourers. For example, sex was sometimes used as a commodity to obtain better work from a foreign labourer. Pamphlets enjoined German women to avoid sexual relations with <b>foreign</b> <b>workers</b> as a danger to their blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} requires foreign domestic helpers {{to leave}} Hong Kong {{within two weeks}} of the termination of their employment contract, unless they find another employer (the two-week rule). According to Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, this is a form of discrimination against foreign domestic helpers (who are almost all Southeast Asian); this limitation is not enforced for other <b>foreign</b> <b>workers.</b> The two-week rule has been condemned by two United Nations committees: the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the 2004census {{indicates}} that only about 15per cent of <b>foreign</b> <b>workers</b> are in the skilled category, with the remainder mostly working in agriculture, cleaning and domestic service. Country of origin {{has been an important}} factor in determining foreign workers' occupational roles in Saudi Arabia. Saudi businesses have traditionally adopted an ethnically defined hierarchical organisation. For example, a recent academic study of a Danish manufacturing company's Saudi subsidiary noted that a manager had to be European, a supervisor had to be Egyptian, Filipino employees often had technical roles, and Indians, the lowest in the hierarchy, worked in production. Foreign workers' presence in Saudi Arabia tends to be transitory: only 3% remain in the country for more than six years.|$|E
