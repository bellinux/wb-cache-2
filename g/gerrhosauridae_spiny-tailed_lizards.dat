25|$|Lizards turn up {{with some}} {{regularity}} as prey {{in some of the}} hotter, drier portions of the golden eagle's range. In Europe, lizards made up to 13% of the prey remains in the French Pyrenees and 12.7% in the Italian Apennines. Fairly large lizards, including the monitor lizard, make the most significant contribution to the golden eagle diet. The most important lizard prey in Europe is the Lacerta genus, i.e. the ocellated <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta lepida). <b>Spiny-tailed</b> <b>lizards</b> of the genus Uromastyx are also of particular note in the golden eagle's diet; they are reportedly the single most important prey for golden eagles in Northeast Africa. In the particularly sparse Negev Desert of Israel, the Egyptian <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>lizard</b> (Uromastyx aegyptia) apparently comprised 89% of the diet, the most a single species has been reported to dominate a golden eagle's diet locally.|$|R
