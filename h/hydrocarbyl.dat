40|$|Afundamental {{challenge}} {{in the development of}} hydrocarbonhydroxylation catalysts based on CH bond activation 1 is the requirement for efficient and compatible oxy-functionalization of the LnMR intermediates to generate ROH. 2, 3 Themost effective catalysts for methane hydroxylation are based on strongly electro-philic and oxidizing cations such as Hg(II), 4 Pt(II), 5 Pd(II), 6 and Au(I/III) 7 in strongly acidic media where both CH activation and oxy-functionalization of the electrophilic LnMCH 3 intermediates are facile. However, well-defined oxy-functionalization catalysts for hydrocarbons based on less electrophilic and less oxidizing metals such as Re, Ru, Ir, and Os have not yet been well developed. 8 This is likely because, while CH activation is known with these systems, 9 oxy-functionalization reactions of less electrophilic LnMR inter-mediates are notwell developed andhave only recently been reported whenR = alkyl group. 10 For electrophilic late transitionmetals, CO bond formation proceeds via nucleophilic attack of an O-based nucelophile (e. g., water) on the electrophilic <b>hydrocarbyl</b> group.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the work {{detailed}} in this dissertation is the investigation of mechanism and catalytic applications of Pt complexes supported by novel anionic di(2 -pyridyl) borate ligands. It was found that oxidation of Me,MeBPy 2 -supported PtII complexes bearing no <b>hydrocarbyl</b> complexes directly generated dimethyl ether in quantitative yields, with one methyl originating from the MeB fragment. We also found that increasing formal charge on the metal center renders related complexes reluctant to undergo oxidation. Based on a proposed mechanism involving a transient PtIV-Me complex, {{we set out to}} develop a series of modified R,RBPy 2 ligands to prevent such oxidatively induced <b>hydrocarbyl</b> transfer. We found that the strategy of replacing one <b>hydrocarbyl</b> (Me) group in the dmdpb ligand by methoxo (OMe) was not sufficient in completely preventing degradation of the borate center. However, derived mono- and di-hydrocarbyl PtII complexes could still be easily oxidized under aerobic conditions. Interestingly, oxidation products corresponding to both B-to-PtIV methyl migration and ligand retention were observed. We focused our attention to a unique 1, 5 -cyclooctanediylBPy 2 ligand, which, we presumed, would prevent <b>hydrocarbyl</b> migration due to the rigid structure imposed by the bicyclic framework. The derived PtIVMe 3 complex was found to exhibit `enhanced' BC-H agostic stabilization of the penta-coordinate PtIV center. Oxidation of derived PtII complexes results in hydride migration from the B-CH fragment onto the PtIV center, {{led to the formation of}} a series of (MeO),(MeO) BPy 2 supported Pt complexes, and unanticipated C-C and C=C coupling at the borate center. The (MeO),(MeO) BPy 2 ligand proved to be the first example of anionic facially chelating borate ligand capable of resisting oxidative degradation.

40|$|The reductive {{elimination}} reactions detailed in this dissertation provide experimental {{insight into the}} mechanism of {{reductive elimination}} to form the C(sp 3) -N bond of benzylamines and the C(sp 3) -O bond of benzyl ethers. The stereochemical outcome of the reaction indicates an ionic pathway, but the process lacks many {{of the effects of}} electronic and solvent perturbations that typically signal an ionic intermediate. We propose that reductive elimination from benzylpalladium(II) amido and aryloxide complexes occurs by dissociation of the amido or aryloxide ligand, followed by nucleophilic attack on the benzyl ligand. The proposed ionic mechanism is more akin to the reductive elimination reactions that occur from high-valent Pt(IV) and Ni(III) complexes than reductive elimination reactions that occur from other Pd(II) complexes. Our data indicate that substantial differences exist between reductive eliminations to form the C(sp 3) bonds in ethers and amines from palladium(II). We prepared alkylpalladium(II) amido complexes to study the C(sp 3) -N reductive elimination reaction from complexes containing a non-benzylic <b>hydrocarbyl</b> ligand. We investigated a series of alkylpalladium amido complexes and observed reductive elimination occurs from bisphosphine-ligated neopentylpalladium amido complexes in low yield. Reductive elimination from neopentylpalladium amido complexes occurs most likely by a concerted reductive elimination reaction, and is favored by the increased steric bulk of the neopentyl ligand. We also investigated azametallacyclic palladium complexes with a norbornyl <b>hydrocarbyl</b> ligand, and observed reductive elimination occurs to form a norbornyl indoline product. We found that the yield was slightly improved over neopentylpalladium complexes, but that the yield of reductive elimination was low. Finally we investigated non-metallacyclic complexes containing a norbornyl <b>hydrocarbyl</b> ligand. We discovered that reductive elimination occurs in moderate yield, and the reductive elimination product ratio indicates a balance between a concerted and an ionic mechanism. 	 The data presented in this dissertation demonstrate that C(sp 3) -N reductive elimination from benzylpalladium(II) and alkylpalladium(II) complexes can occur. We propose an ionic mechanism for the formation of benzylamines and benzyl ethers by reductive elimination from benzylpalladium(II) complexes. Reductive elimination from neopentyl and metallacyclicpalladium(II) complexes likely occurs by a concerted mechanism, demonstrating the importance of steric bulk and metal geometry, respectively. Finally, reductive elimination from non-metallacyclic norbornylpalladium(II) complexes indicates that a concerted and ionic mechanism may occur simultaneously. Although the yield of the alkylamine products is low, the observation that C(sp 3) -N reductive elimination occurs from the alkylpalladium complexes provides the first step toward developing a synthetically useful reaction for the formation of C(sp 3) -heteroatom bonds from low-valent group 10 complexes without the addition of an oxidant...|$|E

Within the present RE series, the complex of the largest ion (Dy 3 +) exhibits the highest activity, achieving a high turnover frequency of 390 min- 1, and also produces the highly isotactic polymer PβMMBL (mm = 91. 0 %). This stereoregular polymer is thermally robust, with a high glass-transition temperature of 280 C, and is resistant to all common organic solvents. Other half-sandwich RE catalysts of the series are also highly active and produce polymers with a similarly high isotacticity. Intriguingly, even simple homoleptic <b>hydrocarbyl</b> RE complexes, RE(CH 2 SiMe 3) 3 (THF) 2 (RE = Sc, Y, Dy, Lu), also afford highly isotactic polymer PβMMBL, despite their much lower polymerization activity, except for the Lu complex, which maintains its high activity for both types of complexes. Computational studies of both half-sandwich and simple <b>hydrocarbyl</b> yttrium complexes have revealed a stereocontrol mechanism that well explains the observed high stereoselectivity of βMMBL polymerization by both types of catalysts.

In this mechanism, formation of an isotactic polymer chiefly originates from interactions between the methyl groups on the chiral β-C atom of the five-membered ring of both the coordinated monomer and the last inserted βMMBL unit of the chain, and the auxiliary ligand on the metal makes a negligible contribution to the stereocontrol of the polymerization. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|E

The influence of the <b>hydrocarbyl</b> ligands bonded to Zr in the three compounds was negligible, if any. It is concluded that possibly the active species promoting isotactic polymerization could be chiral polynuclear organometallic compounds arising from decomposition of the starting ionic species...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemistry}} of late transition metal alkylidenes [M=CR], where R is H a <b>hydrocarbyl</b> group, have attracted widespread attention although mainly {{with reference to}} complexes of metals in low oxidation state. We focus in this paper on reactions based on electrophilic attacks by PhC that allow either isolation of stable cationic Ir(III) alkylidenes, considerably more attractive than well-known Ir(I) counterparts, or the generation of very reactive variants that experience fast migratory insertion into existing Ir-C and Ir-H sigma bonds. The present studies are based on (η-CMe) Ir(III) complexes that bear a cyclo-metalated PMeXyl ligand (Xyl = 2, 6 -MeCH). The contribution of different monoanionic ligands (chloride, alkyl or hydride) to either stabilize the Ir=CR linkage or provide facile reactivity routes has been investigated, {{including the use of}} various deuterium isotopologues of the iridium complex precursors.
