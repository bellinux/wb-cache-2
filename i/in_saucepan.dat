5000|$|Milmyeon ( [...] , meaning [...] "flour noodle") is a Korean dish of {{long and}} thin noodles similar to naengmyeon, {{representing}} the dishes of Busan. The noodle is basically mixing flour powder with starches of sweet potato and potato with meat broth, which bring it and water, {{several kinds of}} vegetables to a simmer <b>in</b> <b>saucepan.</b> The mixture of flour is not fixed at certain ingredients, leading to several transformation like using Artemisia princeps for ssuk milmyeon (쑥 밀면). Milmyeon also has its variety of mul milmyeon and bibim milmyeon applicable for naengmyeon. The {{difference between the two}} is chiefly spicy sauce for bibim milmyeon.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Carrots were cooked to {{the just}} tender stage <b>in</b> a <b>saucepan</b> and <b>in</b> a {{pressure}} <b>saucepan</b> for appropriate lengths {{of time to}} make them approximately equal in tenderness as determined {{by a panel of}} judges and the Kramer Shear Press. A third lot of carrots was cooked <b>in</b> a pressure <b>saucepan</b> for approximately twice as long to represent overcooked carrots. Judges and the Hunter Color Meter indicated that the carrots cooked <b>in</b> the <b>saucepan</b> were more typically red-orange and bright and the carrots overcooked <b>in</b> the pressure <b>saucepan</b> were more yellow and dull. Pigments extracted from the carrots from the three cooking treatments were chromatographed on a magnesia column and the principle fractions, α-carotene and β-carotene, eluted. The β-carotene was rechromatographed on an alumina column to separate it into all-trans-β-carotene and neo-β-carotene B. In absolute amounts, carrots cooked <b>in</b> the <b>saucepan</b> had the highest concentration of all-trans-β-carotene and the highest total of all-trans-β-carotene, neo-β-carotene B and α-carotene, followed by those carrots cooked <b>in</b> the pressure <b>saucepan</b> for 50 seconds, with those cooked <b>in</b> the pressure <b>saucepan</b> for two minutes being lowest in both all-trans-β-carotene and total carotenes. However, when the a-carotene, the neo-pcarotene B and the all-trans-β-carotene were considered as percentages of the total, the percentage of α-carotene remained constant in the three treatments. Carrots cooked <b>in</b> the pressure <b>saucepan</b> for two minutes had a lower percentage of all-trans-β-carotene and a higher percentage of neo-β-carotene B than did carrots from the other two treatments. Thus, longer cooking <b>in</b> the pressure <b>saucepan</b> caused greater conversion of the more vivid all-trans-β-carotene to the paler cis-isomer, neo-β-carotene B. This isomerization plus loss of total pigment accounts for the differences in color of the cooked carrots from the three treatments...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{domestic}} preparation regimes {{on the level}} of the heat-formed toxicant furan was studied to provide useful information for exposure assessment and advice for manufacturers and consumers. Foods were cooked <b>in</b> a <b>saucepan</b> on a gas hob, or microwaved and furan determined by headspace sampling and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In general furan levels did not decrease as much when foods were cooked in a microwave when compared to the same foods cooked <b>in</b> a <b>saucepan.</b> Furan levels decreased in most canned and jarred foods after heating <b>in</b> a <b>saucepan.</b> Low levels of furan in soups in cartons were not changed by any procedure. Furan decreased slightly in foods on standing before consumption but did so more rapidly on stirring. The levels also decreased slightly when foods were left to stand on plates, this observation is attributed to the volatility of furan...|$|R
