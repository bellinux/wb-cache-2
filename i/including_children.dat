5|$|Prisoners {{would often}} take their {{families}} with them, {{which meant that}} entire communities sprang up inside the debtors' jails. The community created its own economy, with jailers charging for room, food, drink and furniture, or selling concessions to others, and attorneys charging fees in fruitless efforts to get the debtors out. Prisoners' families, <b>including</b> <b>children,</b> often had to find employment simply {{to cover the cost}} of the imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{nationwide}} {{news coverage}} in both {{white and black}} newspapers, the incident, and the small abandoned village, slipped into oblivion. Most of the survivors scattered around Florida cities and started over with nothing. Many, <b>including</b> <b>children,</b> took on odd jobs to make ends meet. Education had to be sacrificed to earn an income. As a result, most of the Rosewood survivors took on manual labor jobs, working as maids, shoe shiners, or in citrus factories or lumber mills.|$|E

5|$|After Germany {{occupied}} Hungary in March 1944, the genocidal {{policies of}} the authorities were applied comprehensively. Hungarian Jews were subjected to starvation and death marches, and those that had remained {{in the occupied territories}} were transported to extermination camps. From 26 April 1944, the remaining Jews in Bačka and Baranja, mostly women, but <b>including</b> <b>children</b> and the elderly, were rounded up into local concentration camps then moved to larger camps in Hungary proper. Between 14,000 and 15,000 Jews from Bačka, Baranja and other parts of Hungary were collected at Baja and Bácsalmás then transported to Auschwitz where most were killed. In September 1944, the workforce of the Bor mine was force-marched for several weeks back to extermination camps where the survivors were killed. One of the two groups of workers numbered 2,500, but only a few survived.|$|E
5|$|Pakistani {{intelligence}} {{officials said they}} found letters from Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, after taking control of Lal Masjid. They were written to Abdul Rashid Ghazi and Abdul Aziz Ghazi, directing the brothers and militants to conduct an armed revolt. Government sources believe {{that as many as}} 18 foreign fighters from Uzbekistan, Egypt, and Afghanistan had arrived weeks before the final confrontation and established firing ranges to teach the students, <b>including</b> <b>children,</b> how to handle weapons properly. Diplomats were surprised by how quickly al-Zawahiri condemned the attack on the mosque and called on Pakistanis to rise up against Musharraf's government. Officials blamed the presence of foreign fighters for the breakdown of negotiations, as they seemed about to reach a deal to end the standoff peacefully. According to government sources and western diplomats, the Al-Qaeda fighters in the mosque sought martyrdom instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} part of the media {{franchise}} Megami Tensei, but as Last Bible was developed for a wider audience, <b>including</b> <b>children,</b> the series is toned down compared to Shin Megami Tensei. For instance, players meet monsters rather than demons, and most of the Last Bible titles take place in a medieval fantasy world. The music for the first two games was composed by Hiroyuki Yanada and Iwao Mitsunaga, while Yanada composed the music for Last Bible III on his own, and Manami Matsumae composed the music for Another Bible. Critics have been mostly positive to the series, but the games' graphics have received mixed responses. The music, particularly the one in the first two games, has been positively received. Several music albums with the games' soundtracks have been released by Sweep Records.|$|E

5|$|To {{allow the}} {{introduction}} of the database, the government required all local authorities to implement the Integrated Children's System, a framework to help improve outcomes for children. The government set a deadline of 1 January 2007, and 92 out of the 150 local authorities failed to achieve this. The government began a consultation on the 2007 draft regulations on 21 September 2006 which ended on 14 December 2006. In October 2006, the government selected Capgemini to design the database. On 15 February 2007, the database was renamed from Information Sharing Index to ContactPoint, following research with stakeholder groups, <b>including</b> <b>children</b> and families, who decided that the name ContactPoint made clear what the purpose of the database was: to improve communication between those working with children. A consultation on a guide for database users was launched on 4 May 2007 and ended on 27 July 2007.|$|E
