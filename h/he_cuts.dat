5000|$|At least a {{score of}} decipherments have been claimed since then, none {{of which have been}} {{accepted}} by other rongorongo epigraphers. For instance, ethnographer Irina Fedorova published purported translations of the two St Petersburg tablets and portions of four others. More rigorous than most attempts, she restricts each glyph to a single logographic reading. However, the results make little sense as texts. For example, tablet P begins (with each rongorongo ligature marked by a comma in the translation): <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> a rangi sugarcane, a tara yam, <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> lots of taro, of stalks (?), <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> a yam, <b>he</b> harvested, <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> a yam, <b>he</b> <b>cut,</b> <b>he</b> pulled up, <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> a honui, <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> a sugarcane, <b>he</b> <b>cut,</b> <b>he</b> harvested, he took, a kihi, he chose a kihi, he took a kihi … Text P, recto, line 1 and continues in this vein to the end: he harvested a yam, a poporo, a calabash, he pulled up a yam, <b>he</b> <b>cut,</b> <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> one plant, <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> one plant, a yam, <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> a banana, <b>he</b> harvested a sugarcane, <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> a taro, <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> a kahu yam, a yam, a yam … Text P, verso, line 11 The other texts are similar. For example, the Mamari calendar makes no mention of time or the moon in Fedorova's account: a root, a root, a root, a root, a root, a root is, a lot of roots, a tuber, <b>he</b> took, <b>he</b> <b>cut</b> a potato tuber, he dug up yam shoots, a yam tuber, a potato tuber, a tuber … Text C, recto, line 7 which even Fedorova characterized as [...] "worthy of a maniac".|$|R
60|$|The {{thing had}} happened. He had fought, and starved, and {{suffered}} for eighteen months. He got up one September morning, early.

Major League Baseball, however, still spies on the Simpson family due to an autographed bat McGwire gave Bart that has a hidden camera.|$|E

5|$|The Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty 2007 {{comic book}} {{adaptation}} by Alex Garner retells Raiden's {{role in the}} series, with few changes made to the story. His relationship with Solidus is explored when he remembers his past; when about to be killed by Solidus, Raiden is saved by Snake. The game's novelization by Raymond Benson provides minor modifications to Raiden's history, except for the moment he receives Olga's sword, resulting in a change to his battle psyche. When Raiden kills Solidus <b>he</b> <b>cuts</b> the rope on Federal Hall National Memorial's flagpole, causing an American flag to fall over his enemy's body. This scene was deleted from the original game due to the September 11 attacks.|$|E

25|$|Completing the proof, Perelman takes any compact, simply connected, {{three-dimensional}} manifold without boundary {{and starts}} to run the Ricci flow. This deforms the manifold into round pieces with strands running between them. <b>He</b> <b>cuts</b> the strands and continues deforming the manifold until eventually he is left {{with a collection of}} round three-dimensional spheres. Then he rebuilds the original manifold by connecting the spheres together with three-dimensional cylinders, morphs them into a round shape and sees that, despite all the initial confusion, the manifold was in fact homeomorphic to a sphere.|$|E

25|$|Early Buddhism {{held that}} trees had neither mind nor feeling and might {{lawfully}} be cut; but it recognized that certain spirits might reside in them, such as Nang Takian in Thailand. Propitiation is {{made before the}} axe is laid to the holy trees; loss of life or of wealth {{and the failure of}} rain are feared should they be wantonly cut; there are even trees which it is dangerous to climb. The Talein of Burma prays to the tree before <b>he</b> <b>cuts</b> it down, and the African woodman will place a fresh sprig upon the tree. Some Ancient Indian tree deities, such as Puliyidaivalaiyamman, the Tamil deity of the tamarind tree, or Kadambariyamman, associated with the kadamba tree were seen as manifestations of a goddess who offers her blessings by giving fruits in abundance.|$|E

25|$|The Prince {{then takes}} Elika's body outside. There are four Fertile Grounds there, {{each with a}} tree, that {{according}} to what Elika had told him, channel the power of all the Fertile Grounds to the Tree of Life. He is given a vision {{which is the same}} one both he and Elika shared much earlier that shows her father's deal with Ahriman to revive her. When they shared the vision at that time she told the Prince that visions come from Ormazd, not Ahriman. The vision (just like the main debate throughout the game between Elika and the Prince was all about Destiny vs Free Will) is all about choice. The Prince re-creates the deal made by Elika's father.

25|$|Noticing {{that all}} sinkholes are connected, {{they come to}} the {{conclusion}} that the biggest hydra must be in the center, laying the eggs that hatch into the smaller hydras who wander through the tunnels. They notice that the giants are all going to meet that alpha hydra, and Jack Junior leaves to go kill it, followed by the children. There, they meet the giant multi-headed dragon, who had already started to kill the giants that had gathered to fight it. After hurting Jack Junior and the Grace kids, Nick has an idea and realizes it's up to him to save the day. Using the cap given to him by the merfolk so he could safely breathe, he goes into one of the tunnels with Jack's machete so to meet the hydra from below. When he gets there, instead of trying to kill the beast, <b>he</b> <b>cuts</b> the substance that keeps all the dragons together, thus making them separate from each other and easier for the giants to kill.|$|E
