40|$|Abstract: <b>Epoxy</b> <b>grout</b> is {{used for}} most {{structural}} repair works due to its high strength, adhesive and availability. This study uses epoxy resin and its hardener as binder, graded sand and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) as filler to produce the <b>epoxy</b> <b>grout.</b> The objective is to produce a sufficient mix proportion for <b>epoxy</b> <b>grout</b> that has good workability and high strength properties, {{which can be used}} as structural repair material. The method used to obtain the mix proportion was by trial mix as determined by flowability and strength of the grout. Several batches of epoxy grouts with different epoxy: hardener: filler ratios were designed and tested for its flowability and compressive strength properties. Finally, the mix proportion with fresh properties, namely viscosity or flowability that fulfills the requirements of ASTM C 881 and has optimum strength development was selected. The optimum compressive strength obtained for epoxy grouts with 5 : 1 : 11 epoxy:hardener:filler ratio was above 70 MPa for air cured specimen, which can be considered as high strength repair material. The results for slag based <b>epoxy</b> <b>grout</b> showed that the replacement of slag up to 50 % as filler to epoxy mix with proper mix proportion is suitable to be used in concrete structural repairs...|$|E

40|$|<b>Epoxy</b> <b>grouts</b> {{have been}} widely used for {{repairing}} and rehabilitating structure and transportation pipelines because they are resistant to typical aggressive solutions. In recent years, grouts are used as structural infill in defective structures. The appropriateness of using grouts is highly dependent on the required strength of structures in service condition. This paper experimentally studies the mechanical properties of four <b>epoxy</b> <b>grouts</b> as infill components for structural repair. Compressive, tensile, shear, and flexural properties are determined and compared. The compressive and tensile strengths of the grouts are found to be within the range of 60 - 115 MPa and 10 - 30 MPa respectively, while their compressive modulus ranging from 1. 5 to 6. 0 GPa were measured. The overall results suggest the suitability of these grouts for desired structural repair applications. Finally, recommendations are made on the relevance of using these grouts based on their mechanical properties. The outcome obtained from the study is expected to enhance the applicability of <b>epoxy</b> <b>grouts</b> as infill in structural repair and rehabilitation. ...|$|R

There is no question that such installations provide a basis for highly reliable pumps that operate at low vibration levels. However, when this installation strategy is viewed in terms of the total cost of ownership for the pump, is it really cost effective? This paper examines the total cost of installation of small pumps using conventional metallic baseplates installed with <b>epoxy</b> <b>grout</b> and contrasts this installation strategy with several alternatives.

The paper describes the characteristics and feasibility of the industrial <b>epoxy</b> <b>grout</b> removal process. A minimum power density of approximately 3 kW/cm 2 was found to exist, whilst the minimum interaction time, below which there was no removal of epoxy tile grout, was found to be approximately 0. 5 s.

In addition, the characteristics of the single-stage ceramic tile grout sealing are outlined. The single-stage ceramic tile grout sealing process yielded crack and porosity free seals which were produced in normal atmospheric conditions. Tiles were successfully sealed with power densities as low as 550 W/cm 2 and at rates of up to 420 mm/min. In terms of mechanical, physical and chemical characteristics, the single-stage ceramic tile grout was found to be far superior to the conventional epoxy tile grout and, in many instances, matched and occasionally surpassed that of the ceramic tiles themselves...|$|E

Both epoxy tile grout and laser generated enamel seals were tested for compressive strength, surface roughness, wear, water permeability and acid/alkali resistance. The enamel seal showed clear improvements in strength, roughness and wear, whilst being impermeable to water, and resistance (up to 80 % concentration) to nitric acid, sodium hydroxide and detergent acids. The bond strength and the rupture strength of the enamel seal were also investigated, revealing that the enamel adhered to the new grout and the ceramic tiles with an average bond strength of 45 - 60 MPa, whilst the rupture strength was comparable to the ceramic tiles themselves. The average surface roughness of the seals and the tiles was 0. 36 m and 0. 06 m respectively, whilst for the conventional <b>epoxy</b> <b>grout</b> the average surface roughness when polished was 3. 83 m, and in excess of 30 m without polishing.

The single-stage ceramic tile grout sealing process was carried out in normal atmospheric conditions. Tiles were successfully sealed with power densities as low as 1. 25 kW/cm 2 and at rates of up to 600 mm/min, with the resultant glazes displaying no discernible cracks or porosities. Bonding of the enamel to the crushed ceramic tile mix was identified as being primarily due to van der Waals forces and, on a very small scale, some of the crushed ceramic tile mix material dissolving into the glaze. In terms of mechanical, physical and chemical characteristics, the single-stage ceramic tile grout was found to be far superior to the conventional <b>epoxy</b> tile <b>grout</b> and, in many instances, matched and occasionally surpassed that of the ceramic tiles themselves. What is more, the development of a hand-held HPDL beam delivery unit and the related procedures necessary to lead to the commercialisation of the single-stage ceramic tile grout sealing process are presented. Further, an appraisal of the potential hazards {{associated with the use of}} the HPDL in an industrial environment and the solutions implemented to ensure that the system complies with the relevant safety standards are given...|$|R

The wait time effects of cementitous <b>grouts,</b> <b>epoxy,</b> acrylic latex, and polyvinyl acetate bonding agents were observed on bond strength. Three rapid repair materials were as a comparison to bond strength, as well as concrete samples with no bonding agents having dry conditions and saturated surface dry moisture condition. The bonding agents and rapid repair materials were tested in a controlled laboratory environment. Bond strength loss with wait times of 0, 2, 5, 10, and 30 minutes were observed when bonding agents were applied. The laboratory samples were loaded using a direct shear test. Field tests were performed using the same repair materials and bonding agents. When the agents were applied in the field the wait times used were 0, 15, 30, and 45 minutes. 7 day and 5 month pull off tensile tests were performed during the field experiment. The data from both experiments show that when using cement grout bonding agents the high bond strength can be obtained when the repair material is applied within 15 minutes of application of the cement grout, and after 15 minutes bond loss can be expected. Wait time didn't have a significant effect on epoxy and acrylic latex bonding agents as long as they were placed before setting. The polyvinyl acetate agent and repair materials can develop high bond strength in laboratory settings, but when used in the field the bond strengths experience loss. When not using bonding agents in a repair, adequate bond strength can be obtained when using saturated surface dry condition...|$|R
