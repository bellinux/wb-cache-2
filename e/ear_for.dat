5|$|Braille's <b>ear</b> <b>for</b> music {{enabled him}} to become an {{accomplished}} cellist and organist in classes taught by Jean-Nicolas Marrigues. Later in life, his musical talents led him to play the organ for churches all over France. A devout Catholic, Braille held the position of organist in Paris at the Church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs from 1834 to 1839, and later at the Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{a federal}} survey of food {{consumption}} determined that {{for women and}} men {{over the age of}} 19, average consumption was 9.7 and 14.2mg/day, respectively. For women, 17% consumed less than the <b>EAR,</b> <b>for</b> men 11%. The percentages below EAR increased with age. The most recent published update of the survey (NHANES 2013-2014) reported lower averages - 9.3 and 13.2mg/day - again with intake decreasing with age.|$|E

5|$|The Broken Ear {{was first}} serialised in Le Petit Vingtième from December 1935 {{under the title}} Tintin et Milou chez les Arumbayas (Tintin and Snowy among the Arumbayas). From 7 February 1937, the story was also serialised in the French Catholic newspaper, Cœurs Vaillants. In 1937, it was {{collected}} in a single hardcover volume and published by Éditions Casterman under the title L'Oreille cassée (The Broken <b>Ear).</b> <b>For</b> this collected edition, one small change was made; the minor character of Carajo was renamed Caraco, because the word carajo is Spanish slang for penis.|$|E
5|$|Injuries to the {{external}} ear occur fairly frequently, and can leave minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an <b>ear,</b> <b>for</b> discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{primates}} such as gorillas and orang-utans (and also humans) have undeveloped ear {{muscles that}} are non-functional vestigial structures, yet are still {{large enough to}} be easily identified. An ear muscle that cannot move the <b>ear,</b> <b>for</b> whatever reason, has lost that biological function. This serves as evidence of homology between related species. In humans, there is variability in these muscles, such that some people are able to move their ears in various directions, and {{it has been said that}} it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials. In such primates, the inability to move the ear is compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a horizontal plane, an ability which is not common to most monkeys—a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for {{molybdenum}} in 2000. If {{there is}} not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) is used instead. The current <b>EAR</b> <b>for</b> molybdenum for people ages 19 and up is 34 μg/day. The RDA is 45 μg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 50 μg/day. RDA for lactation is 50 μg/day. For children ages 1–18 years the RDA increases with age from 17 to 43 μg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of molygdenum the UL is 2000 μg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs {{are referred to as}} Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).|$|E
5|$|Donna {{is taken}} to a dying TARDIS, which UNIT has managed to use as {{the core of a}} crude time machine. Rose uses energy from the TARDIS to show Donna the beetle on her back, but tells her they do not know what it is. She insists that Donna travel back to the day she made the fateful turn and choose to turn left again. Donna is transported back minutes before she would make that turn, but too far away to contact her past self in time. She makes the {{decision}} to walk out in front of a passing truck and let it hit her, creating a traffic jam that causes her past self to turn left out of impatience. As Donna lies on the ground dying, Rose whispers a message into her <b>ear</b> <b>for</b> the Doctor. The alternate universe disappears, and Donna finds herself back on Shan Shen. The beetle falls off of Donna's back, and the fortune teller runs away after uttering some terrified words about what Donna will become.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated the {{estimated}} average requirements (EARs) and recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for copper in 2001. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) is used instead. The current <b>EAR</b> <b>for</b> copper for people age 14 and older is 0.7mg/day. The RDA is 0.9mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. The RDA for pregnancy is 1.0mg/day. RDA for lactation is 1.3mg/day. For infants up to 12 months, AI is 0.22mg/day. For children age 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 0.34 to 0.7mg/day. As for safety, the IOM also sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of copper the UL is set at 10mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs {{are referred to as}} Dietary Reference Intakes.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To analyze mastoid findings, such as {{facial nerve}} {{dehiscence}} (FND), labyrinthine fistula, and dural exposure; to review its incidence at cholesteatoma surgery; to analyze {{its association with}} semicircular canal fistula; and to elucidate its relationship with dural exposure. Design: One hundred fifty-two patients (65 males and 87 females; 155 ears) were enrolled in a retrospective study of tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy.

25|$|In most {{amplifiers}} {{a reduction}} in gain takes place before hard clipping occurs; {{the result is a}} compression effect, which (if the amplifier is an audio amplifier) sounds much less unpleasant to the <b>ear.</b> <b>For</b> these amplifiers, the 1nbsp&dB compression point is defined as the input power (or output power) where the gain is 1nbsp&dB less than the small signal gain. Sometimes this non linearity is deliberately designed in to reduce the audible unpleasantness of hard clipping under overload.|$|E
