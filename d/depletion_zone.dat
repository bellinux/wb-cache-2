The coverage was measured by quantitative metallography. The absolute value of depth was measured by the quantitative potentiostatic electrochemical test. Other electrochemical (potentiodynamic and potentiostatic) techniques were used to assess the depth of chromium <b>depletion</b> <b>zones.</b> New parameters have been developed to express the results of the potentiodynamic, potentiostatic, and electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (EPR) tests that reflect the contributions attributable to either coverage and depth or only the depth of chromium <b>depletion</b> <b>zones.</b> It has been shown that these new parameters are sensitive in the range of 7. 5 % to 13. 5 % Cr in the <b>depletion</b> <b>zones.</b> For the EPR test, the new parameters make it more sensitive to discriminate highly sensitized samples, which was also not possible by the parameter P [...] The results of these test techniques were correlated with the results of the intergranular corrosion (IGC) (ASTM A 262, Practice C) and intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) (ASTM G 123) tests.

40|$|The {{influence}} of electronic {{states of the}} semiconductor matrix on the precipitation of metallic As clusters in GaAs epilayers grown by molecular beam epitaxy at low temperatures were studied. From x-ray diffraction and Hall effect measurements, the presence of free carriers was found to occur in a certain time {{after the start of}} the coarsening stage of the precipitation. Transmission electron microscope observations indicate that redistributions of As clusters between the doped and undoped regions starts at the same time with the appearance of free carriers. Redistributions of As clusters occurs in pn junction structures {{in such a way that}} <b>depletion</b> <b>zones</b> of the pn junctions become free from As clusters, leading to close correlation of widths of precipitate free zones with those of the <b>depletion</b> <b>zones</b> of the pn junctions for various dopant concentrations.

30|$|In {{a second}} stage of {{annealing}} (573 - 773 K for 1800 - 3600 s) a growth process of the Au clusters occurs. The late state of cluster growth is accompanied by the formation of circular <b>depletion</b> <b>zones</b> around the largest clusters.

50|$|With {{a battery}} {{connected}} this way, {{the holes in}} the p-type region and the electrons in the n-type region are pushed toward the junction and start to neutralize the <b>depletion</b> <b>zone,</b> reducing its width. The positive potential applied to the p-type material repels the holes, while the negative potential applied to the n-type material repels the electrons. The change in potential between the p side and the n side decreases or switches sign. With increasing forward-bias voltage, the <b>depletion</b> <b>zone</b> eventually becomes thin enough that the zone's electric field cannot counteract charge carrier motion across the p-n junction, which as a consequence reduces electrical resistance. The electrons that cross the p-n junction into the p-type material (or holes that cross into the n-type material) will diffuse into the nearby neutral region. The amount of minority diffusion in the near-neutral zones determines the amount of current that may flow through the diode.|$|E

40|$|During {{the first}} order phase {{transitions}} the objects of a new phase consume a mother phase which leads to some density gaps near existing embryos of a new phase. This fact is rather obvious [1], but complete theoretical description was given only in [2]. Now this fact in widely recognized [3] but still there are some attempts [4] to reconsider this approach which {{is now known as}} the model of <b>depletion</b> <b>zones</b> [3]. Here we shall analyze [4] and show the useless of reconsideration proposed in [4]. We don’t consider here the picture of the gobal evolution of a system- in [4] it is so primitive that can not give any reliable quantitative results but only some very rough estimates without any justifications. We needn’t to do it because this has been already done in [2] with all necessary justifications. So, we consider only the profile around the solitary embryo, which was the matter of interest in [4]. Why it is possible to consider only the solitary embryo? An answer has been given in [2], in [4] this question remains unsolved. Due to results of [2] we shall consider namely the solitary embryo. We assume that the substance exchange regime is a diffusion one. Then there is a gap of a vapor density n near an embryo. Then the density n differs from a density n(∞). This difference initiates a variation in a nucleation rate I and causes the effect of <b>depletion</b> <b>zones.</b> So, it is very important ro get for n(r) −n(∞) (r is a distance from a center of an embryo) a correct expression. This expression is a crucial point in consideration of an effect of <b>depletion</b> <b>zones</b> in nucleation kinetics. Certainly, {{it has to be a}} function of time t.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of two-dimensional late-stage coarsening for nucleation and growth or Ostwald ripening are performed at area fractions 0. 05 to 0. 4 using the monopole and dipole approximations of a boundary integral formulation for the steady state diffusion equation. The simulations are performed using two different initial spatial distributions. One is a random spatial distribution, {{and the other}} is a random spatial distribution with <b>depletion</b> <b>zones</b> around the particles. We characterize the spatial correlations of particles by the radial distribution function, the pair correlation functions, and the structure function. Although the initial spatial correlations are different, we find time-independent scaled correlation functions in the late stage of coarsening. An important feature of the late-stage spatial correlations is that <b>depletion</b> <b>zones</b> exist around particles. A log-log plot of the structure function shows that the slope at small wave numbers is close to 4 and is - 3 at very large wave numbers for all area fractions. At large wave numbers we observe oscillations in the structure function. We also confirm the cubic growth law of the average particle radius. The rate constant of the cubic growth law and the particle size distribution functions are also determined. We find qualitatively good agreement between experiments and the present simulations. In addition, the present results agree well with simulation results using the Cahn-Hilliard equation...|$|R

50|$|Varactors are {{operated}} in a reverse-biased state, so no DC current {{flows through the}} device. The amount of reverse bias controls {{the thickness of the}} <b>depletion</b> <b>zone</b> and therefore the varactor's junction capacitance. Generally, the depletion region thickness is proportional to the square root of the applied voltage, and capacitance is inversely proportional to the depletion region thickness. Thus, the capacitance is inversely proportional to the square root of applied voltage.|$|E
50|$|It is {{easiest to}} {{understand}} how a current is generated when considering electron-hole pairs that are created in the <b>depletion</b> <b>zone,</b> which is {{where there is a}} strong electric field. The electron is pushed by this field toward the n side and the hole toward the p side. (This is opposite to the direction of current in a forward-biased diode, such as a light-emitting diode in operation.) When the pair is created outside the space charge zone, where the electric field is smaller, diffusion also acts to move the carriers, but the junction still plays a role by sweeping any electrons that reach it from the p side to the n side, and by sweeping any holes that reach it from the n side to the p side, thereby creating a concentration gradient outside the space charge zone.|$|E
50|$|The MESFET {{differs from}} the common {{insulated}} gate FET or MOSFET in {{that there is no}} insulator under the gate over the active switching region. This implies that the MESFET gate should, in transistor mode, be biased such that one does not have a forward-conducting metal-semiconductor diode instead of a reversed-biased <b>depletion</b> <b>zone</b> controlling the underlying channel. While this restriction inhibits certain circuit possibilities as the gate must remain reverse-biased and cannot therefore exceed a certain voltage of forward bias, MESFETs analog and digital devices work reasonably well if kept within the confines of design limits. The most critical aspect of the design is the gate metal extent over the switching region. Generally the narrower the gate modulated carrier channel the better the frequency handling abilities, overall. Spacing of the source and drain with respect to the gate, and the lateral extent of the gate are important though somewhat less critical design parameters. MESFET current handling ability improves as the gate is elongated laterally, keeping the active region constant, however is limited by phase shift along the gate due to the transmission line effect. As a result, most production MESFETs use a built up top layer of low resistance metal on the gate, often producing a mushroom-like profile in cross section.|$|E

Typically, islands of metallic Ni or Pt(Ni) particles are embedded in lower scale layers due to rapid selective growth of TiO 2 and low oxygen potential within the scale.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the antisymmetrization is often {{addressed}} as a local property of the many-electron wave function, namely that the wave function should vanish when two electrons with parallel spins {{are in the same}} position in space. In this paper, we emphasize that this presentation is unduly restrictive: we illustrate the strong non-local character of the antisymmetrization principle, together with {{the fact that it is}} a matter of spin symmetry rather than spin parallelism. To this aim, we focus our attention on the simplest representation of various states of two-electron systems, both in atomic (helium atom) and molecular (H 2 and the π system of the ethylene molecule) cases. We discuss the non-local property of the nodal structure of some two-electron wave functions, both using analytical derivations and graphical representations of cuttings of the nodal hypersurfaces. The attention is then focussed on the {{impact of the}} antisymmetrization on the maxima of the two-body density, and we show that it introduces strong correlation effects (radial and/or angular) with a non-local character. These correlation effects are analyzed in terms of inflation and <b>depletion</b> <b>zones,</b> which are easily identifiable, thanks to the nodes of the orbitals composing the wave function. Also, we show that the correlation effects induced by the antisymmetrization occur also for anti-parallel spins since all Ms components of a given spin state have the same N-body densities. Finally, we illustrate that these correlation effects occur also for the singlet states, but they have strictly opposite impacts: the inflation zones in the triplet become <b>depletion</b> <b>zones</b> in the singlet and vice versa...|$|R

Therefore, the observed depletion of biotite around garnet porphyroblasts provides direct evidence for diffusion-controlled growth. The <b>depletion</b> <b>zone</b> is recognized as diffusional haloes around garnet porphyroblasts. Sillimanite is also an important reactant that supplies Al to garnet, but it is scarce in the matrix.
