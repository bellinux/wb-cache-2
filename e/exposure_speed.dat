However, research shows that virtual reality techniques can be beneficial to prevent cognitive decline via either cybercycling or memory trainings.

Exposure time testing was carried out on two types of patterns. There were completely filled in areas, binary period gratings (ratio 1 : 1 between exposed and unexposed areas), and multileveled structures (computer generated holograms). Exposures data was prepared according to standard technology (PMMA resist, exposure dose, non-alcoholic based developer) for both systems.

It has been produced under this name since about 1980 (Kodak P- 255, 1981) and is available on Kodak’s Estar base {{in a number of}} thicknesses and sizes. The thick **base Tech Pan is designated 4415 and has been used with great success by the amateur astronomical community for many years (e. g. Martys 1991). Its astronomical potential was recognised early by Everhart (1981). However, tests at professional telescopes (e. g. West et al. 1981) and early sensitometer tests at the UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST) in 1981 and 1987 were discontinued when the glass and film samples did not respond well to normal hypersensitisation techniques. These and other difficulties led to a lack of interest among the professional astronomical community until quite recently (Russell et al. 1992; Parker & Malin 1992). The first successful use of 14 x 14 inch hypered Tech-Pan 4415 film in the UKST was in March 1991. Films were obtained which exhibited excellent image quality and resolution. Furthermore, in good seeing these appeared to be about 1 magnitude deeper than the equivalent IIIa-F emulsion on glass but with considerably lower grain noise. This result was achieved because two main problems associated with Tech-Pan and film use in the UKST have been resolved. These were: 1 obtaining Tech-Pan film with long <b>exposure</b> <b>speed</b> sufficient for deep astronomical photography (i. e. reduction of low intenstiy reciprocity failure); 2 overcoming the practical difficulties of mounting large-format flexible film at the UKST’s curved focal surface...|$|E

Despite the widespread use of the technology and the need to create a strong deterrent effect, research has yet to determine if there is a relationship between levels of exposure to the devices and subsequent self-reported deterrent effects. As a result, licensed motorists (N = 536; 51 % female) in Queensland (Australia) were recruited to complete a questionnaire that measured <b>exposure</b> to <b>speed</b> cameras and associated offending behaviours. Data were analyzed utilising descriptive, bivariate and multivariate statistics. The key findings that emerged were: the sample reported a higher level of exposure to fixed cameras (even though there are more operational mobile cameras), younger males were most likely to speed and be observant of speed cameras and that perceived certainty of apprehension was the largest reported deterrent force. However, a positive (rather than negative) relationship was found between perceived camera <b>exposure</b> levels and <b>speeding</b> behaviours, which indicates a range of additional factors (both legal and non-legal factors as well as driving <b>exposure</b> levels) influence <b>speed</b> limit non-compliance. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that higher levels of perceptual certainty were associated with general speed compliance and perceptions of the severity and swiftness of sanctions, rather than levels of self-reported camera exposure. This paper is the first to reveal that while motorists prone to speed may be more cognisant of speed camera operations, this in itself does not ensure appropriate behaviour modification...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Computed Tomography (CT) is a {{technology}} that obtains the tomogram of the observed objects. In real-world applications, especially the biomedical applications, lower radiation dose have been constantly pursued. To shorten scanning time and reduce radiation dose, one can decrease X-ray exposure time at each projection view or decrease the number of projections. Until quite recently, the traditional filtered back projection (FBP) method has been commonly exploited in CT image reconstruction. Applying the FBP method requires using {{a large amount of}} projection data. Especially when the <b>exposure</b> <b>speed</b> is limited by the mechanical characteristic of the imaging facilities, using FBP method may prolong scanning time and cumulate with a high dose of radiation consequently damaging the biological specimens. Methods In this paper, we present a compressed sensing-based (CS-based) iterative algorithm for CT reconstruction. The algorithm minimizes the l 1 - norm of the sparse image as the constraint factor for the iteration procedure. With this method, we can reconstruct images from substantially reduced projection data and reduce the impact of artifacts introduced into the CT reconstructed image by insufficient projection information. Results To validate and evaluate the performance of this CS-base iterative algorithm, we carried out quantitative evaluation studies in imaging of both software Shepp-Logan phantom and real polystyrene sample. The former is completely absorption based and the later is imaged in phase contrast. The results show that the CS-based iterative algorithm can yield images with quality comparable to that obtained with existing FBP and traditional algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) algorithms. Discussion Compared with the common reconstruction from 180 projection images, this algorithm completes CT reconstruction from only 60 projection images, cuts the scan time, and maintains the acceptable quality of the reconstructed images. </p...|$|E

ObjectiveThe goal {{of this study was to}} examine the impact of coadministration of probenecid on the pharmacokinetic parameters and tolerability of olmesartan in healthy volunteers. MethodsIn a randomized, open-label, 2 -way crossover study, 12 volunteers received 2 oral treatments (olmesartan alone or olmesartan plus probenecid) separated by 4 days. Blood samples were obtained for a 48 -hour pharmacokinetic evaluation after drug administration.

We sampled thalli from 27 stations on the Midwest coast of Norway and recorded age, and length- and strength-related characters.

An increase in current speed seemed to have a considerable effect at low wave exposure levels, but the relationship weakened at high wave exposure levels.

Differences in wave <b>exposure</b> and current <b>speed</b> had very weak influences on lamina biomass and length.

40|$|The {{combination}} of two images shot for the same scene but under different illumination {{has been used in}} wide applications ranging from estimating scene illumination, to enhancing photographs shot in dark environments, to shadow removal. An example is the use of a pair of images shot with and without a flash. However, for consumer-grade digital cameras, due to the different illumination conditions the two images usually have different camera settings when they are taken, such as exposure time and white balance. Thus adjusting (registering) the two images becomes a necessary step prior to combining the two images. Unfortunately, how to register these two images has not been investigated fully. In this paper, we propose a method which can parametrically adjust the two images so as to compensate for the difference in <b>exposure</b> <b>speed,</b> ISO, aperture size, and white balance. This is accomplished by training a 2 nd-order masking model on a set of image pairs to predict the model parameters. This trained model can then be used to register two images. In the training phase, we wish to develop a scheme for adjusting the magnitude in each color channel of one image to register with the other image, for each image pair. The problem is difficult because {{the difference between the two}} images is a composite of both camera settings and illumination. Here, we use the simple fact that a shadow effect should be caused purely by the changes of illumination. Suppose we have two images, one of which is taken under illuminant 1 and the other is taken under illuminant 1 plus illuminant 2. If we subtract the first image from the second, a shadow caused by illuminant 1 should disappear in the resulting difference. By adjusting the RGB pixel values of one image so as to completely remove the shadow in the difference image, compensating magnitudes for each color channel can be computed and used to train a masking model. This masking model can then accurately compensate for camera settings for any two new images such that the difference between compensated images reflects only the difference in illumination...|$|E
40|$|Offset lithographic {{printing}} plates, until several years ago, used incoherent light sources for image creation in light sensitive coatings. These light sources are {{primarily in the}} ultraviolet light region. Image creation, using an incoherent light source, requires either a film negative or positive and long exposure times. Exposure time {{is dependent on the}} sensitivity of the light sensitive coating and the light intensity. In recent years both equipment and plate suppliers have been working to develop offset {{lithographic printing}} plates which use coherent laser light for image creation. To date all recorded developments have worked on light hardening image creation techniques. At present there has been no recorded effort in developing a thermal curing technique, using a coherent infrared laser beam, for image creation. The infrared laser light would be used to thermal-harden image areas only and leave non-image areas soft or unexposed. After exposure, non-image areas would be removed with a developing solvent. This thesis was conducted to determine if image creation would be possible based on thermal curing of a modified phenolic resin. Ten experiments were conducted to determine the image creation requirements of different coating formulations and various exposure conditions. Several coating formulations were used to determine the optimum coating for thermal curing using a carbon dioxide infrared laser. Exposure time, <b>exposure</b> <b>speed</b> and light intensity (laser output power) were varied to determine the effect each has on thermal -hardening of the modified phenolic resin coating. Experimental results supported the theory that images could be created in a modified phenolic resin coating. Both halftone dots and solids could be created in the coating. Solids required much less energy than halftone dots. It is believed that {{this is due to the}} poor infrared absorption of the coating. Solids received much longer exposure time than halftone dots. This longer exposure time enables the coating to absorb more infrared light. Further studies of the thermal response of the modified phenolic resin coating could make the plate a useable product in the future. It is believed that the phenolic resin coating could become a useable method of image creation with further modifications. Infrared absorption of the coating must be increased to enable images to be created at higher exposure speeds and shorter exposure times. Other exposure techniques could also be investigated to reduce the amount of energy required to thermal-harden the coating...|$|E

There is community demand for investment in rider training programs but no high-quality evidence about its effectiveness in preventing crashes. This randomised trial of an on-road rider coaching program aimed to determine its effectiveness in reducing crashes in novice motorcycle riders. MethodsBetween May 2010 and October 2012, 2399 newly-licensed provisional riders were recruited in Victoria, Australia and completed a telephone interview before randomisation to intervention or control groups. Riders in the intervention group were offered an on-road motorcycle rider coaching program which involved pre-program activities, 4 h riding and facilitated discussion in small groups with a riding coach. Outcome measures were collected for all participants via telephone interviews at 3 and 12 months after program delivery (or equivalent for controls), and via linkage to police-recorded crash and offence data. The primary outcome was a composite measure of police-recorded and self-reported crashes; secondary outcomes included traffic offences, near crashes, riding exposure, and riding behaviours and motivations. ResultsFollow-up was 89 % at 3 months and 88 % at 12 months; 60 % of the intervention group completed the program. Intention-to-treat analyses conducted in 2014 indicated no effect on crash risk at 3 months (adjusted OR 0. 90, 95 % CI: 0. 65 – 1. 27) or 12 months (adjusted OR 1. 00, 95 % CI: 0. 78 – 1. 29).

These methods require the administration of contrast medium injected or infused into a peripheral vein, combined with either dynamic computed tomographic scanning or some form of electrocardiographic gated computed tomography. The newer conventional computed tomographic scanners can display anatomic structures in the heart and great vessels with considerable fidelity and provide not only cross-sectional displays but also, by means of computer manipulation, any selected reconstructed images in oblique, coronal or sagittal projections. Feasibility studies indicate improved accuracy of computed tomographic measurements of cardiac chamber volumes. Physiologic measurements include estimation of shunt flows and cardiac output and analysis of myocardial wall thickening. The full potential of computed tomography should be reached once fast, multiple slice, computed tomographic scanners using scanning electron beam techniques become available. The prototype CVCT (cine computed tomographic C- 100 scanner) designed at the University of California, San Francisco, is now undergoing evaluation. This instrument images up to eight contiguous slices at the rate of 16 to 24 images/so The computed tomographic scanner specifically designed for cardiac imaging should extend the utility of computed tomography in the evaluation of cardiac diseases and the study of cardiovascular physiology...|$|R
