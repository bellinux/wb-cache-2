40|$|This paper {{brings a}} {{geographical}} perspective {{to bear on}} the study of the humanitarian aid industryʼs relation to the spaces it operates within. It argues that this allows us to move beyond a narrow focus on policy to consider how the security-driven segregation identified in the literature manifests itself in the everyday geographies of the people who populate this industry: <b>international</b> <b>aid</b> <b>workers.</b> It accomplishes this by using travel journals and in-depth interviews to map and unpack the daily comings and goings of 13 <b>international</b> <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> in Beirut, Lebanon: a city with a sizeable humanitarian presence, significant security concerns, and yet no fortified aid compounds. This particular case reveals how the aid industry is implicated in local sociospatial processes and how its spatial patterns are in fact determined by pre-existing forms of (securitised) segregation. By employing the literature on geographies of fear to observe how <b>international</b> <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> navigate this landscape, this paper therefore seeks to re-scale security, revealing it to be sociospatial practice which ties together the everyday and the geopolitical...|$|R

40|$|Humanitarian {{reconstruction}} after {{a large-scale}} natural disaster {{has become a}} key site of international politics; a site where global assumptions, relationships, and responsibilities are negotiated, solidified and questioned. While post-crisis response strategies and institutional practices have strong spatial and material characteristics, these are rarely considered as significant, either to the reconstruction effort, or to international politics more generally. This article identifies and examines the 'auxiliary space' created by the everyday practices of <b>international</b> <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> and asks whether its effects may lead to unanticipated and potentially transformative outcomes {{not only for the}} reconstruction effort, but also for global North-South relations at large.

40|$|This paper {{takes at}} its {{starting}} point public criticism of <b>international</b> <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> {{who appear to}} be ‘doing well out of poverty’. Based on fieldwork in Cambodia, the paper suggests that such public perceptions are mirrored by some aid workers' uncertainties about the moral dimensions {{of their own and}} others' lifestyles. Significantly, analyses of such public and private unease are largely absent from development ethics, even though comparable professions, such as nursing or social work, having produced substantial work on these issues. I argue that the scarcity of equivalent studies in development studies is partly the result of a tendency to foreground the ‘other’—the world's poor—while rendering those who deliver aid invisible. Placing ‘aid recipients’ and ‘aid givers’ in separate categories, together with an emphasis on collective rather than individual moral responsibilities, not only makes it difficult to conduct open debates on the role of altruism and professionalism among <b>aid</b> <b>workers,</b> but also indicates how practices of ‘othering’ continue to inform aspects of development theory and practice...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} some of the engagements and {{practices}} of <b>international</b> <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> can be productively understood as forms of moral labour. Taking Hardt’s concept of ‘immaterial labour’ (1999) as a point of reference, the paper examines the moral practices that <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> engage {{in the course of their}} work and personal lives. Much of the relevant literature focuses on the humanitarian imperative - that is, the implied moral responsibility of better-off nations and individuals to assist others in need. Less extensively, some development literature has adopted the understanding of aid and development assistance in moral frameworks of the gift, or ‘doing good’. What happens, though, in terms of experienced and practiced moralities in the concrete situations and scenarios generated by such helping imperatives? Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork among <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> in Cambodia, the paper examines some of the perhaps inevitable moral entanglements which these workers find themselves in, and have to negotiate. The analytical benefits of framing these efforts as ‘moral labour’ include a broadened understanding of how morality matters in aid beyond the helping imperative, as well as raising the question whether <b>aid</b> <b>workers</b> effectively participate in a division of moral labour, vis-a-vis, for example, fellow citizens in their home countries...|$|R
