Lardera's sculpture began with abstract metal structures based on two dimensions, or a flat <b>geometrical</b> <b>plane,</b> which challenged the conventional form of sculpture based around volume and enclosed spaces. Later his work became more diverse, with his geometrical constructions branching out into the horizontal as well as the vertical plane and often resulting in series based on a single theme, such as his Miracles, Aubes and Archanges series.|$|E
50|$|Another type of sundial {{follows the}} motion of a single point of light or shadow, which may be called the nodus. For example, the sundial may follow the sharp tip of a gnomon's shadow, e.g., the shadow-tip of a {{vertical}} obelisk (e.g., the Solarium Augusti) or {{the tip of the}} horizontal marker in a shepherd's dial. Alternatively, sunlight may be allowed to pass through a small hole or reflected from a small (e.g., coin-sized) circular mirror, forming a small spot of light whose position may be followed. In such cases, the rays of light trace out a cone {{over the course of a}} day; when the rays fall on a surface, the path followed is the intersection of the cone with that surface. Most commonly, the receiving surface is a <b>geometrical</b> <b>plane,</b> so that the path of the shadow-tip or light-spot (called declination line) traces out a conic section such as a hyperbola or an ellipse. The collection of hyperbolae was called a pelekonon (axe) by the Greeks, because it resembles a double-bladed ax, narrow in the center (near the noonline) and flaring out at the ends (early morning and late evening hours).There is a simple verification of hyperbolic declination lines on a sundial: the distance from the origin to the equinox line should be equal to harmonic mean of distances from the origin to summer and winter solstice lines.|$|E

Virtually any object in the game can be cut, including vehicles and enemies, though elements of the environment were intentionally limited to structures such as pillars and walls to better facilitate the game. Entering Blade Mode produces a special targeting reticule {{in the form of a}} transparent blue plane which can be rotated and moved, tracing orange lines across the surfaces of objects to indicate exactly where they will be cut; it can also be used to enter a bullet time state, giving players the opportunity to precisely slash targets during moments of action, such as slicing through a falling target from multiple angles before it hits the ground. These features can be employed strategically, for example disabling opponents, finding weak points and gaps in armor, severing support columns to collapse ceilings or walls onto enemies, deflecting enemy fire, or cutting through objects to remove enemy cover. However, entering into Blade Mode reduces Raiden's energy to the point that if dropped to a certain level, it cannot be used. Throughout the story the player obtains the Ripper Mode, a state which enhances Raiden's power for a limited time facilitating the use of Blade Mode.|$|E
5000|$|With its {{elevation}} of spirit, depth of feeling and erudite pictoriality, this exhibition {{is a rare}} occurrence {{over the course of}} a century. I am not normally prone to bursts of enthusiasm. Awestruck by the evidence, however, I recognise the magnificence of an art that is strange, troubling, provocative in respect of time and surroundings, the idea of perfection unusual in a world that cultivates the ephemeral, superficiality, imposture and financial success. (N.b. Henry Mavrodin does not sell his art insofar as it is experienced as an intimate dialogue with destiny or God, whoever he might be.) Knowing the morality of artists, I know that he will be hated for his limited, shining, long-lasting glory. For a great artist, I was once told by the eminent art historian Eugenio Riccomini, who dedicated a monograph in Italy to our painter and was kind enough to open the exhibition in Bucharest, enemies are important. Henry Mavrodin is a bizarre alloy of pride and humility: natural pride in the creative professions (only public servants and others of their kind have a claim on mediocrity), and equally natural humility towards the great landmarks in the history of art, which he fatally dreams of achieving and equalling. He shows a sacred respect for the great European painting of centuries past and sees himself as a happy prisoner of its emotional space, most likely for a number of fundamental reasons: spiritual harmony, the need for meaning, the urgent need for philosophical inquiry, the possibility of probing the sublime complexities of technique. Those who reject improvisation, rapid and cheap recognition, seem to have no other path to choose. (...)We contemplate calmly a picture which demands our attention insatiably, melancholically, imploringly, aggressively, like mute suffering condemned to silence and strictly visual confession. The colours appear to have been invented by providence, they submit to reason and intuition alike in proportions that are implacable and, therefore, perfect. The objects have a secret life. The faces at times take on the appearance of masks; the landscapes, the compositions wrestle with their volumetric reality, inevitably crucified in bidimensionality. Their refined ambiguity attempts to combine in pure visuality material consistency and its ghost, the mental reading of an image in perspective and the concreteness of the <b>geometrical</b> <b>plane</b> of the canvas surface.Henry Mavrodin is a soul trapped between two worlds. One of his works can take a year to complete, as recorded scrupulously at the bottom of the work like a tally. The fast-paced world of today has thrown him out and into the heart of eternal art. His admirers will be rare but of a high quality. He is the final firework display in the amazing adventure of painting which began centuries ago, says professor Eugenio Riccomini. His room for manoeuvre appears to be limited. It is not. Between the memory of great past values and the contemporary world, which is incapable of establishing its own values, our painter, so extravagant with time, stubbornly and miserly saves up death in life, and installs himself comfortably as occupying an uninhabited plot of land. He fills empty space and treats wounds that continue to bleed under the surface, following in his master's footsteps, whose unusual portrait he worked on for seven years, and from which he learned that art does not march with the regiment, but consumes itself in sweet and sour solitude.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{correctly}} predict the kinematics of complex structures, analysis using three-dimensional finite elements (3 DFEs) {{seems to be}} the best alternative. However, simulation of large multi-layered structures with many plies can be unaffordable with 3 DFEs because of the excessive computational cost, especially for non-linear materials. In addition, the discretization of very thin layers can lead to highly distorted FEs carrying numerical issues, therefore, reduced models arise as an affordable solution. This paper describes a new finite element formulation to perform numerical simulations of laminated reinforced concrete structures. The intention of this work is that the proposed scheme can be applied in the analysis of real-life structures where a high amount of computational resources are needed to fulfill the meshing requirements, hence the resulting formulation has to be a compromise between simplicity and efficiency. So that, the condensation of a dimension (thickness), mandatory to model three-dimensional structures with two-dimensional finite elements (2 DFEs), leads to refer all layers contained within such FEs to a plane, which is typically named middle plane or <b>geometrical</b> <b>plane,</b> since its sole function is to serve as a geometrical reference. This work {{is based on the assumption}} that the <b>geometrical</b> <b>plane</b> has to be distinguished from a mechanical plane, which is where the resultant stiffness of all layers is contained.

The acoustic emission for a jet Strouhal number of about 0. 3 exceeds the emission for all other Strouhal numbers nearly everywhere along the measurement plane.
