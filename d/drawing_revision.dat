If {{there is any}} unclear information that would prevent the detailer from creating or completing the drawings accurately, a request for information(RFI) {{is sent to the}} relevant trades(typically the general contractor, architect or structural engineer) before proceeding. If the required information is not needed immediately, then the detailer may opt to list the questions on the drawings. Following creation of the drawing, the detailer must usually (as described above) submit a copy of the drawing to the architect and engineer for review ("approval"). Copies of the drawing may be sent to other recipients at this time as well, such as the general contractor, for informational purposes only. The drawing must also be checked for accuracy and completeness by another detailer (for this purpose, the [...] "checker"). To keep track of changes during the drawing creation workflow, the revisions are identified by incrementing an associated number or letter code which should appear in the <b>drawing</b> <b>revision</b> block. Comments arising from approval and corrections made during checking must be resolved, and the original drawing must be updated accordingly (or [...] "scrubbed"). After this, the drawing may be released to the fabricator and/or erector for use in construction.|$|E

Due to this situation, contractors faced several difficulties on their performance in terms of cost, time, and quality. Therefore, this paper intends to identify the accuracy and timeliness of information on performance of contractors. The aim is to identify how deficiencies in accuracy and timeliness of information affect performance of contractors in terms of cost, time, and quality. The outcome of this study will be beneficial for practitioners in Sri Lankan construction industry to reduce practical issues related accuracy and timeliness of information. Detailed questionnaire survey was used to identify the significant factors relating to accuracy and timeliness of information. Findings revealed that ‘mistakes in design’ and ‘incomplete drawings’ as the most significant factors on cost performance of contractors; ‘delay in design’, and ‘slow <b>drawing</b> <b>revision</b> and distribution’ as the most significant factors on time performance of contractors and ‘mistakes in design’ and ‘incomplete drawings’ as the most significant factors on quality performance of contractors.

40|$|A {{computerized}} interactive harness engineering {{program has}} been developed to provide an inexpensive, interactive system which is designed for learning and using an engineering approach to interconnection systems. PCACE is basically a database system that stores information as files of individual connectors and handles wiring information in circuit groups stored as records. This directly emulates the typical manual engineering methods of data handling, thus making the user interface to the program very natural. Data files can be created, viewed, manipulated, or printed in real time. The printed ouput is in a form ready for use by fabrication and engineering personnel. PCACE also contains {{a wide variety of}} error-checking routines including connector contact checks during hardcopy generation. The user may edit existing harness data files or create new files. In creating a new file, the user is given the opportunity to insert all the connector and harness boiler plate data which would be part of a normal connector wiring diagram. This data includes the following: 1) connector reference designator, 2) connector part number, 3) backshell part number, 4) cable reference designator, 5) cable part number, 6) <b>drawing</b> <b>revision,</b> 7) relevant notes, 8) standard wire gauge, and 9) maximum circuit count. Any item except the maximum circuit count may be left blank, and any item may be changed at a later time. Once a file is created and organized, the user is directed to the main menu and has access to the file boiler plate, the circuit wiring records, and the wiring records index list. The organization of a file is such that record zero contains the connector/cable boiler plate, and all other records contain circuit wiring data. Each wiring record will handle a circuit with as many as nine wires in the interface. The record stores the circuit name and wire count and the following data for each wire: 1) wire identifier, 2) contact, 3) splice, 4) wire gauge if different from standard, 5) wire/group type, 6) wire destination, and 7) note number. The PCACE record structure allows {{for a wide variety of}} wiring forms using splices and shields, yet retains sufficient structure to maintain ease of use. PCACE is written in TURBO Pascal 3. 0 and has been implemented on IBM PC, XT, and AT systems under DOS 3. 1 with a memory of 512 K of 8 bit bytes, two floppy disk drives, an RGB monitor, and a printer with ASCII control characters.

This thesis is focused around work toward creating a global, high-level information and material value stream map for a specified pipe assembly. It identifies the largest areas of waste in the value stream and their root causes. The recommendations assist with the reduction and elimination of the major time delays, inventory buildups, re-work, excessive processes and other waste in the system. The pipe assembly chosen {{as the basis for}} the enterprise value stream map is part of a system, newly developed for the current aircraft carrier. The pipe assembly is representative of other pipe assemblies fabricated in the shipyard, so challenges experienced with the manufacturing and flow of the selected assembly are likely to be seen in many other pipe assemblies in the facility. A large number of assemblies was examined to determine the root causes of delivery problems. The analysis was based on the criticality of the ship need date. The root causes for the late assembly delivery were found to be inadequate material inventory levels in the warehouses, lack of fabrication timeline coordination between fabrication shops, late engineering <b>drawing</b> <b>revisions,</b> underestimated fabrication durations, late supplier delivery, late material purchase order placement, and lost material. Suggestions are provided to improve operational efficiencies by targeting the elimination of these root causes that result in the delay of assembly fabrication.

40|$|Simple {{time series}} {{analysis}} of changes to Consensus forecasts of annual GDP growth point to forecast revisions being serially correlated, suggesting that forecasts can be improved upon by anticipating future revisions. Our approach examines whether revisions to Consensus GDP growth forecasts for individual countries exhibit distinctive properties and therefore, contain extra information that would be lost through aggregation. ARMA models are applied to Consensus forecasts revisions of annual average GDP growth in the contemporaneous and following year sub-samples for 14 different countries. The individual country forecasts are then combined to obtain next period’s expected forecast revision to an aggregate 14 -country GDP series (GDP 14). Forecast performance is empirically evaluated by deriving out-of-sample forecasts and comparing these to an ARMA forecast based on the aggregate GDP 14 revisions. Although individual country forecast revisions exhibit distinctive time series properties, we do not find compelling statistical evidence to unequivocally favour a combination ARMA forecast over a GDP 14 ARMA forecast. However, the adjustment each model implies for GDP 14 out to a six-steps ahead {{in response to a}} range of impulses (stylised revisions) can differ considerably over some <b>draws</b> of <b>revision</b> vectors. Although we cannot draw any strong conclusions about the significance of these differences, this exercise is particularly useful for tracing the differences between the propagation mechanisms underlying each model.

This occurs in the instances of mediated exposure when people find themselves unwillingly in the news. After an initial theoretical discussion of the emotion of shame and how such theories need to be revised in order to capture the structural transformations pertaining to mediated interaction, the article concentrates on a personal narrative of unwanted mediated exposure and observes how shame can be generated and amplified in the context of mediation, thus revealing the symbolic power of the media with potential consequences for social monitoring and conformity...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{traces the}} history of the {{teaching}} of English within the state system of education in the nineteenth century through the twentieth century and the writing of a national curriculum. More specifically, it traces definitions of language upon which its teaching has been based and the theories that have informed that teaching. This history is located within the wider social context of its formation. It contends that the teaching of English within a national State system of education was made possible by the standardisation of English as the language of the newly formed nation state. Teaching English, therefore, is primarily concerned with teaching language and through the texts it uses with teaching particular versions of society. It is divided into two parts. The first part considers formations of English and definitions of language {{from the beginning of the}} nineteenth century to the nineteen eighties. It describes the language theory that informed the teaching of language and their change from a prescriptive to descriptive basis. The second part of the thesis considers in more detail the writing of a national curriculum for English and the theories of language upon which the original curriculum and subsequent <b>revisions</b> <b>drew.</b> It ends by proposing a formation of English informed by contemporary language theory and the subject of stylistics centred upon the writing and study of 'text' as defined by the printed word...|$|R

Two core sampling systems were operational during this reporting period-push mode core sampling system No. 1 and rotary mode core sampling system No. 4. The availability average for core sampling systems No. 1, No. 3 and No. 4, combined, was 45 percent, down from 79 percent for the previous quarter and 58 percent for FY 1998. System No. 2 did not have scope during the quarter, and availability was not hacked. System No. 3 was out of service the entire quarter for corrective maintenance. Two tanks were core sampled during the reporting period, and 24 samples were retrieved. Core sample recovery increased slightly during the quarter. System No. 1 average sample recovery increased from 80 percent to 81 percent, The rotary mode core sampling average recovery increased to 62 percent from 55 percent for the previous quarter. sampling six tanks, one more than scheduled. Vapor Sampling was utilized in support of the sluicing of tank 241 -C- 106 and for emissions monitoring of three exhaust stacks. Increased support was provided for Vapor Sampling the Standard Hydrogen Monitoring Systems. The sampling was necessary due to freezing problems with the field-installed systems. Preparations are continuing for the Light-Duty Utility Arm (LDUA) deployment with configuration and minor hardware upgrades. The LDUA Operational Readiness Review continues. The oversight of the Nested, Fixed-Depth Sampler system development has started to increase {{in order to ensure that}} a usable system is received when the project is completed. To improve configuration control, 92 <b>drawing</b> sheet <b>revisions</b> were completed along with the generation of nine new drawing sheets.

5000|$|Revisions {{occur in}} {{sequence}} over time, {{and thus can}} be arranged in order, either by revision number or timestamp. Revisions are based on past revisions, though {{it is possible to}} largely or completely replace an earlier revision, such as [...] "delete all existing text, insert new text". In the simplest case, with no branching or undoing, each revision is based on its immediate predecessor alone, and they form a simple line, with a single latest version, the [...] "HEAD" [...] revision or tip. In graph theory terms, <b>drawing</b> each <b>revision</b> as a point and each [...] "derived revision" [...] relationship as an arrow (conventionally pointing from older to newer, {{in the same direction as}} time), this is a linear graph. If there is branching, so multiple future revisions are based on a past revision, or undoing, so a revision can depend on a revision older than its immediate predecessor, then the resulting graph is instead a directed tree (each node can have more than one child), and has multiple tips, corresponding to the revisions without children ("latest revision on each branch"). In principle the resulting tree need not have a preferred tip ("main" [...] latest revision) - just various different revisions - but in practice one tip is generally identified as HEAD. When a new revision is based on HEAD, it is either identified as the new HEAD, or considered a new branch. The list of revisions from the start to HEAD (in graph theory terms, the unique path in the tree, which forms a linear graph as before) is the trunk or mainline. Conversely, when a revision can be based on more than one previous revision (when a node can have more than one parent), the resulting process is called a merge, and is one of the most complex aspects of revision control. This most often occurs when changes occur in multiple branches (most often two, but more are possible), which are then merged into a single branch incorporating both changes. If these changes overlap, it may be difficult or impossible to merge, and require manual intervention or rewriting.|$|R
