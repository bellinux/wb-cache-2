50|$|The Torino GT came {{standard}} with non-functional hood scoop molded {{into the}} hood, GT emblems (including {{the centre of}} the grille), dual colour-keyed sport mirrors, full width tail lights with a honeycomb effect (the centre portion was non-functional but reflective), black decklid appliques (SportsRoof only), and hub caps with wheel trim rings. Standard tires for the GT were E70-14 fibreglass belted tires, while convertibles wore F70-14s. New options for the Torino GT were a reflective laser stripe, which ran {{down the middle of the}} side of the Torino from the front fender to the door, and Hideaway <b>headlamps.</b> <b>Motor</b> Trend magazine tested a 1970 Torino GT SportsRoof with a 429 CJ, C-6 Automatic, and 3.50:1 gears, and obtained a 0 - 60 mi/h km/h time of 6.0 seconds, while the quarter mile took 14.4 seconds at 100.2 mi/h km/h.|$|E

40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} that shares the steady-state and the dynamic voltage-current (V-I) characteristics of a xenon <b>headlamp</b> in a <b>motor</b> vehicle. This study proposes the modelling method, {{which is based on}} the spline interpolation algorithms including a major factor such as its temperature that is responsible for the design of an high-intensity discharge (HID) ballast during a hot re-strike. As the model simulates the transition process of an HID lamp, the simulation system that includes the HID ballast and the lamp model will be illustrated in detail. The results from the simulation and the experiments will lead to the model validation {{at the end of the}} study. This study provides a valuable approach for the optimisation of the HID ballast and the design of a system controller. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|R
5000|$|My Lords, I am sure...the Duke {{need not}} apologise for drawing the {{attention}} of the House to this important work of road planting which, as Bishop of Truro has said, contributes so much to the beauty of the English countryside. I assure the...Duke that...the Minister is keenly interested in this work of road planting...The Ministry of Transport has for a long time past—and indeed the...Duke bore witness to that in his remarks—been fully alive to the importance of providing suitable trees and shrubs, as well as grass verges, as part of the design of modern highways. This is desirable, not only to improve the appearance of the roads, to make them more attractive in themselves and to prevent them from clashing violently with the country landscapes through which they pass, but also {{from the point of view}} of road safety......improvement schemes which can be undertaken at the present time are limited to those which are of vital importance...Ministerhas reluctantly decided that expenditure from the Road Fund must be limited for the present to small schemes, mainly those which are essential for road safety. For example, there is no objection to the provision of shrubs on central margins which will prevent the risk of dazzle from the <b>headlamps</b> of <b>motor</b> vericles, or of boundary hedges for the safety of road users...to meet the Ministry's future requirements on trunk roads, a contract to the value of £4,373 was signed in 1948 for the supply of plants and trees from 1951 to 1957.
