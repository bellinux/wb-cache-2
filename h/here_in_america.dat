500|$|Bass's {{announcement}} {{received a}} large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving [...] "overwhelming support" [...] from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync. However, Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as [...] "straight-acting" [...] in his People interview, stating, [...] "I call them the SAGs— the straight-acting gays. We're just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer." [...] This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes. In a 2007 interview with The Advocate, Bass called his comment a [...] "mistake" [...] and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term. Bass stated, [...] "Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last civil rights movement we have left <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>America.</b> So when someone new like myself comes along and says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can see how people would get pissed." ...|$|E

50|$|While anti-capitalist {{struggle}} and Marxist analysis has an indistinct and relatively undigested {{place in the}} field of educational theory, there is some movement towards Marx in the social sciences <b>here</b> <b>in</b> North <b>America.</b> Marx is being revisited by social scientists of all disciplinary shapes and sizes - even, and perhaps most especially and urgently today, when capitalism {{is in a state of}} severe crisis.
