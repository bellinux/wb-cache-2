40|$|In {{an attempt}} to help find meaning within {{qualitative}} data, researchers commonly start by <b>coding</b> their <b>data.</b> There {{are a number of}} coding systems available to researchers and this reflexive account explores my reflections on the use of two such techniques. As part of a larger investigation, two pilot studies were undertaken as a means to examine the relative merits of open coding and template coding for examining transcripts. This article does not describe the research project per se but attempts to step back and offer a reflexive account of the development of <b>data</b> <b>coding</b> tools. Here I reflect upon and evaluate the two <b>data</b> <b>coding</b> techniques that were piloted, and discuss how using appropriate aspects of both {{led to the development of}} my final <b>data</b> <b>coding</b> approach. My exploration found there was no clear-cut ‘best’ option but that the <b>data</b> <b>coding</b> techniques needed to be reflexively-aligned to meet the specific needs of my project. This reflection suggests that, when <b>coding</b> qualitative <b>data,</b> researchers should be methodologically thoughtful when they attempt to apply any <b>data</b> <b>coding</b> technique; that they do not assume pre-established tools are aligned to their particular paradigm; and that they consider combining and refining established techniques as a means to define their own specific codes.   DOI: 10. 2458 /azu_jmmss. v 6 i 1. 18772 DOI: 10. 2458 /azu_jmmss. v 6 i 1. 18772 </p...|$|R

40|$|Many {{real world}} {{phenomena}} are better represented by non-precise data {{rather than by}} single-valued data. In fact, non-precise data represent two sources of variability: the natural phenomena variability and the variability or uncertainty induced by measurement errors or determined by specific experimental conditions. The latter variability source is named imprecision. When there are information about the imprecision distribution the fuzzy <b>data</b> <b>coding</b> is used to represent the imprecision. However, in many cases imprecise data are natively defined only by the minimum and maximum values. Technical specifications, stock-market daily prices, survey data are some examples of such kind of data. In these cases, interval data represent a good <b>data</b> <b>coding</b> {{to take into account}} the imprecision.
