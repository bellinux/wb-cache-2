There have been five {{editions of the}} instrument as of 2017 – these are the original Nord Stage in 2005, the Nord Stage EX in 2008, the Nord Stage 2 in 2011, the Nord Stage 2 EX in 2015, and the Nord Stage 3 in 2017.|$|E

25|$|According to one {{influential}} school, {{the human}} vocal apparatus is intrinsically digital {{on the model}} of a keyboard or digital computer. If so, this is remarkable: nothing about a chimpanzee's vocal apparatus suggests a <b>digital</b> <b>keyboard,</b> notwithstanding the anatomical and physiological similarities. This poses the question as to when and how, during and the course of human evolution, the transition from analog to digital structure and function occurred.|$|E

50|$|Stage pianos {{differ from}} {{inexpensive}} home <b>digital</b> <b>keyboards</b> {{in a number}} of ways. Home <b>digital</b> <b>keyboards</b> provide several hundred sounds, ranging from imitation electric piano and flute sounds to buzzy synth-style sounds. However, the imitation sounds are created by relatively simple synthesis methods, rather than by sampling or complex Digital Signal Processing-modelling, {{as in the case of}} a high-end stage piano. This means that the sound quality of presets are not suitable for a professional performance.|$|R

500|$|With {{aggregated}} {{scores of}} 57percent and 54 from GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively, Battle for Naboos PC port garnered significantly lower review scores than its Nintendo 64 counterpart. Many {{complaints about the}} PC version stemmed {{from the fact that}} the game was not optimized for the PC when it was ported. Computer Games Magazines Adam Fleet thought the game was ugly, citing [...] "truly bland textures and sad-looking 2D sprites". Next Generations Jim Preston bluntly wrote that the [...] "graphics suck." [...] Of the audio, GameSpot's Giancarlo Varanini wrote, [...] " [...] isn't that bad, but it isn't quite as good as the audio in other similar games", and goes on to describe the music as sounding [...] "tinny." [...] Varanini also took issue with the PC version's aiming controls, stating that because Battle for Naboo was originally designed for the Nintendo 64's analog controller, it is difficult to aim using a PC's <b>digital</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Preston agreed, writing that controlling the game is [...] "nearly impossible" [...] with a digital controller or mouse.|$|E
2500|$|An {{electronic}} keyboard may also called a <b>digital</b> <b>keyboard,</b> portable keyboard, or [...] home keyboard, referring their digital-based sound generation and light-weight, portable build. In China, Japan, India, and Southeast Asia (particularly Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand), {{electronic keyboard}}s were often mistakenly {{referred to as}} an organ, due to popularity of home electronic organs in those countries and keyboards/synthesizers are considered as a similar instrument.|$|E

50|$|Some effect pedals {{used with}} {{electromechanical}} keyboards {{such as the}} Fender Rhodes electric piano or <b>digital</b> <b>keyboards</b> respond to loudness and so, indirectly, to key velocity. Examples include overdrive pedals, which produce a clean sound for softer notes, and a distortion effect for louder notes—and fixed wah-wah pedals that filter the audio signal based on loudness.|$|R

50|$|A {{final version}} of the {{original}} machine was produced after <b>Digital</b> <b>Keyboards</b> was shut down in early 1985. Digital Keyboards' chief designer, Mercer Stockell, decamped and formed Mulogix with Jim Wright and Jerry Ptascynski. The Mulogix Slave 32 was a Synergy re-packaged into two rack-mount modules with a MIDI interface. The Slave 32 could read and write EPROM cartridges from the Synergy.|$|R
50|$|Huyler {{grew up in}} Winnetka, Illinois as {{the oldest}} of three brothers. Bored {{throughout}} high school, he skipped college and in 1988 started a electronic graphics business with his father. The company he two created folded up within a year, however, and the NetBoy concept was slowly forming while Huyler worked as a pizza deliverer and programmed <b>digital</b> <b>keyboards</b> for musicians.|$|R
5000|$|When played live, <b>digital</b> <b>keyboards</b> {{were used}} to {{replicate}} the sound of various instruments such as harpsichord and tack piano, and electric drums were used in place of timpanis. These <b>digital</b> <b>keyboards</b> were kept for the album's recording, though a real upright piano and timpani was used. Some alterations were also made to tracks' specific arrangements, since they had been arranged with an audience in mind, along with the logistics of only having ten performers on stage. Linett elaborated: [...] "For the studio version of Smile, Brian and the band eliminated some of the flourishes that were designed just for live performance and substantially reworked the instrumental arrangements." [...] Most engineering for the album was modeled after practices common during the 1960s, and tracks were recorded and sequenced in discrete sections {{the same as they}} would have been on the original Smile. The vocals were recorded using a tube console identical to the one used by the Beach Boys at United Western Recorders in the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Eustace has {{arranged}} and composed music mostly for the piano, digital piano and <b>digital</b> <b>keyboard.</b> The Bradley Eustace Digital Music Library are {{a collection of}} seven books for beginner to advanced piano, digital piano and <b>digital</b> <b>keyboard</b> students.

5000|$|At one point, Roland {{acquired}} the then-defunct Rhodes name, and released {{a number of}} <b>digital</b> <b>keyboards</b> bearing the Rhodes brand. Harold Rhodes had regained the right to the name in 2000 prior to his death that same year. Rhodes was dissatisfied with Roland's treatment of the marque, and had plans to re-introduce his iconic electric piano, but died before {{he was able to}} bring it to market.|$|R
500|$|The {{original}} Hammond organ {{was never}} {{designed to be}} transported regularly. A Hammond B-3 organ, bench, and pedalboard weighs [...] This weight, combined {{with that of a}} Leslie speaker, makes the instrument cumbersome and difficult to move between venues. This created a demand for a more portable and reliable way of generating the same sound. Electronic and <b>digital</b> <b>keyboards</b> that imitate the sound of the Hammond are referred to as [...] "clonewheel organs".|$|R
50|$|The sustain pedal {{prevents}} individual key dampers from lifting {{when the}} player releases the key. All notes {{played with the}} sustain pedal ring until the player releases the sustain pedal (or until the note completely decays). With the dampers not applied, octave, fifth, and other overtones vibrate sympathetically, producing a richer sound. Most electronic keyboards also have a sustain pedal that holds notes and chords, but only high-end <b>digital</b> <b>keyboards</b> reproduce the sympathetic vibration effect.|$|R

The Korg M1 (released 1988) was the first widely known and popular music workstation, and became the world's best-selling <b>digital</b> <b>keyboard</b> synthesizer of all time. During its six-year production period, more than 250,000 units were sold.|$|E
50|$|He {{subsequently}} {{worked with}} David Biro {{to develop the}} Birotron, which used the then popular 8-track cassette format rather than tape strips. Because of the advent of <b>digital</b> <b>keyboards</b> at that time, and expensive components used in the instruments' manufacture, the Birotron was never a commercial or technical success. Only 35 Birotrons were produced. These days, he can be found with more modern instruments such as the Korg Kronos, Yamaha Montage, and the Memotron, a new digital version of the original Mellotron.|$|R
5000|$|After Hohner stopped {{producing}} the Clavinet E7 and Clavinet Duo, {{they used the}} brand name for electronic and <b>digital</b> <b>keyboards</b> with no electro-mechanical sound production features.

These instruments were designed for the home market, and made no attempt to emulate the electro-mechanical Clavinet. In 2000, Hohner disassociated themselves from the Clavinet completely by transferring their spare parts inventory to the restoration website Clavinet.com.|$|R
