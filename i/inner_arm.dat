40|$|To {{understand}} {{mechanisms of}} regulation of dynein activity along {{and around the}} axoneme we further characterized the "dynein regulatory complex" (drc). The lack of some axonemal proteins, which together {{are referred to as}} drc, causes the suppression of flagellar paralysis of radial spoke and central pair mutants. The drc is also an adapter involved in the ATP-insensitive binding of I 2 and I 3 <b>inner</b> dynein <b>arms</b> to doublet microtubules. Evidence supporting these conclusions was obtained through analyses of five drc mutants: pf 2, pf 3, suppf 3, suppf 4, and suppf 5. Axonemes from drc mutants lack part of I 2 and I 3 <b>inner</b> dynein <b>arms</b> as well as subsets of seven drc components (apparent molecular weight from 29, 000 to 192, 000). In the absence of ATP-Mg, dynein-depleted axonemes from the same mutants bind I 2 and I 3 <b>inner</b> <b>arms</b> at both ATP-sensitive and -insensitive sites. At ATP-insensitive sites, they bind I 2 and I 3 <b>inner</b> <b>arms</b> to an extent that depends on the drc defect.

40|$|Background: Primary ciliary {{dyskinesia}} (PCD) {{results in}} chronic nasal symptoms and chest disease leading to bronchiectasis. We noted {{a number of}} patients referred for diagnostic testing whose initial results suggested PCD due to an <b>inner</b> dynein <b>arm</b> or radial spoke defect but on retesting no abnormality was found. Methods: An audit of all patients referred for PCD diagnostic testing over a three year period whose initial electron microscopy (EM) and beat pattern analysis suggested an <b>inner</b> dynein <b>arm</b> or radial spoke defect. Results: Twenty-one patients referred for diagnostic testing for PCD suspected of an <b>inner</b> dynein <b>arm</b> defect and six suspected of a radial spoke defect on initial EM and beat pattern analysis had repeat testing performed.

40|$|Direct imaging {{observations}} {{have revealed}} spiral structures in protoplanetary disks. Previous {{studies have suggested}} that planet-induced spiral arms cannot explain some of these spiral patterns, due to the large pitch angle and high contrast of the spiral arms in observations. We have carried out three dimensional (3 -D) hydrodynamical simulations to study spiral wakes/shocks excited by young planets. We find that, in contrast with linear theory, the pitch angle of spiral arms does depend on the planet mass, which {{can be explained by the}} non-linear density wave theory. A secondary (or even a tertiary) spiral <b>arm,</b> especially for <b>inner</b> <b>arms,</b> is also excited by a massive planet. With a more massive planet in the disk, the excited spiral arms have larger pitch angle and the separation between the primary and secondary arms in the azimuthal direction is also larger. We also find that although the arms in the outer disk do not exhibit much vertical motion, the <b>inner</b> <b>arms</b> have significant vertical motion, which boosts the density perturbation at the disk atmosphere. Combining hydrodynamical models with Monte-Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we find that the <b>inner</b> spiral <b>arms</b> are considerably more prominent in synthetic near-IR images using full 3 -D hydrodynamical models than images based on 2 -D models assuming vertical hydrostatic equilibrium, indicating the need to model observations with full 3 -D hydrodynamics. Overall, companion-induced spiral arms not only pinpoint the companion's position but also provide three independent ways (pitch angle, separation between two arms, and contrast of arms) to constrain the companion's mass.

40|$|The 0. 5 M KCl-treatment solubilizes {{the outer}} arms from sea urchin sperm axonemes. Approximately 30 percent of A-polypeptide, {{corresponding}} to dynein 1 in SDS- polyacrylamide gel, was solubilized by this treatment (as SEA-dynein 1). Electron microscopic observation {{indicated that the}} extracted axonemes lacked the outer arms in various degrees. The DEA-dynein 1 was that the extracted axonemes lacked the outer arms in various degrees. The SEA-dyenin 1 was purified and an antiserum against it was prepared in rabbits. The specificity of antiserum to dynein 1 was determined by immunoelectrophoresis and ouchterlony’s double-diffusion test. The anti-dynein 1 serum inhibited ATPase activity of purified SEA-dynein 1 by 95 percent. By the indirect peroxidase-conjugated antibody method, the loci of SEA-dynein 1 within the intact, salt- extracted and mechanically disrupted axonemes were determined to be the outer arms: deposition of electron-dense materials which represents their localization was detected at the distal ends of the outer arms, {{in the case of}} intact axonemes. The 5 - 6 cross- bridge was hardly decorated. No decoration was seen in the salt-extracted axonemes lacking all the outer arms. In disrupted axonemes, which consist of single to several peripheral doublets, electron-dense materials were deposited only on the outer arms. Approximately 73 percent of axonemal ATPase activity sensitive to antiserum was solubilized by repeated salt-extractions. One-half of A-polypeptide (SEA-dynein 1 located at the outer arms) was contained in the pooled extracts. The extracted axonemes contained another half of A-polypeptide (SUA-dynein 1 supposed to locate at the <b>inner</b> <b>arms)</b> and retained 31 percent of axonemal ATPase activity that was almost resistant to antiserum.

We developed an efficient means of extracting the outer row of dynein arms in demembranated sperm tail axonemes, leaving the inner row of dynein arms structurally and functionally intact. Sperm tail axonemes depleted of outer arms beat at half the beat frequency of sperm tails with intact arms over a wide range of ATP concentrations. The isolated, outer arm-depleted axonemes were induced to undergo microtubule sliding in the presence of ATP and trypsin. Electron microscopic analysis of the relative direction of microtubule sliding (see Sale, W. S. and P. Satir, 1977, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 74 : 2045 - 2049) revealed that the doublet microtubule with the row of <b>inner</b> dynein <b>arms,</b> doublet N, always moved by sliding toward the proximal end of the axoneme relative to doublet N + 1. Therefore, the <b>inner</b> <b>arms</b> generate force such that doublet N pushes doublet N + 1 tipward.

Such axonemes retained 42 - 8 ± 7 - 3 % of their total axonemal ATPase activity and showed C, A, D and B bands in the dynein region of 4 % SDS-gel, while a solubilized fraction of the outer arms consisted almost entirely of A band polypeptide. We have succeeded in causing extrusion of the outer doublets from such axonemes by addition of ATP and trypsin. A bundle of outer doublets was sometimes observed to be extruded first from an axoneme and to show bending motion for a while, subsequently followed by a sliding of separate doublets past each other. The speed of the tubule extrusion process was slower and around 60 % of that of intact axonemes having both types of arm.
