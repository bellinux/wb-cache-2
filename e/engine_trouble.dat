5|$|Nine days later, Hurricanes, {{escorted by}} a pair of Spitfires from No. 352 Squadron, flew a patrol over the island of Rab and {{adjacent}} areas of the Adriatic, but were unable to positively identify any targets. On 4 November, aircraft from No. 351 Squadron, again escorted by two Spitfires, were tasked with interdicting road communications between Bihać and Knin. One aircraft developed <b>engine</b> <b>trouble</b> and had to return to base, but the rest continued with the mission. They ran into heavy anti-aircraft fire near Knin, and one aircraft was shot down, the pilot bailing out and being captured by the Germans. The next mission, on 9 November, was hampered by extremely poor weather over the target area near Trebinje. One aircraft flew into a mountain, killing the pilot, and another suffered <b>engine</b> <b>trouble</b> and crash-landed near Trebinje, the pilot escaping unhurt.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 2005, JALways Flight 58 {{operated}} by a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 from Fukuoka to Honolulu experienced left-wing <b>engine</b> <b>trouble</b> shortly after takeoff. The aircraft immediately returned to Fukuoka Airport. Some engine parts fell on the Sharyo district of Fukuoka and several people were slightly injured and parked car windscreens damaged.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials were}} plagued with serious <b>engine</b> <b>trouble,</b> {{culminating}} in the failure of an entire turbine on 2 November. Moreno was forced to put in at Rockland, Maine—where many of the observers on board were left to be brought back by train to Camden—before proceeding for repairs to the Fore River Shipyard, which had built the ship's engines.|$|E

5|$|After {{experiencing}} <b>engine</b> <b>trouble</b> on {{her first}} attempt at a transatlantic crossing, West Gate was unsuccessfully attacked by two German submarines in early July 1918 while returning to port for repairs. After successfully completing her trip to France, she began her second transatlantic trip in early October. In {{the early morning hours}} of 7 October, West Gates steering gear jammed and , another Navy cargo ship, collided with the West Gate, sinking her. Seven men lost their lives in the accident.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Carl {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} in 1867 until 1895, when she was removed from front-line service {{to serve as a}} training ship. During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871, the ship formed part of the main German squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Jachmann. <b>Engine</b> <b>trouble,</b> however, plagued the ship and two of the other three vessels in the squadron; as a result, they made only two sorties from the port of Wilhelmshaven to challenge the French blockade. Neither resulted in combat.|$|E
5|$|Giffen's {{force was}} tracked by Japanese submarines, who {{reported}} its location and movement. Around mid-afternoon, {{based on the}} submarine reports, 16 Mitsubishi G4M Type 1 bombers from the 705 Air Group (705AG) and 16 Mitsubishi G3M Type 96 bombers from the 701 Air Group (701AG) took off from Rabaul carrying torpedoes to attack Giffen's force. One Type 96 turned back with <b>engine</b> <b>trouble,</b> leaving 31bombers in the attack force. The leader of the 705AG aircraft was Lieutenant Tomō Nakamura and Lieutenant Commander Joji Hagai commanded the 701AG planes.|$|E

5|$|Schnaufer, who had {{received}} the German Cross in Gold on 16 August 1943, flew his first operational mission with 12./NJG1 {{on the night of}} 17/18 August 1943. Although uncertain, it is assumed that Handke was Schnaufer's radio and radar operator on this mission. Bomber Command had targeted Peenemünde and the V-weapons test centre that night. Schnaufer, who had been tasked with leading one of the first Zahme Sau missions under Y-Control, had to abort the mission early due to <b>engine</b> <b>trouble.</b>|$|E
5|$|That week {{confined}} {{to my room}} actually saved my life. I {{had been scheduled to}} go up on a gunnery flight the afternoon that I was confined. My roommate took the flight instead of me, in an aircraft I had been scheduled to fly. Shortly after he took off, while {{on his way to the}} gunnery range, he developed <b>engine</b> <b>trouble</b> and had to crash-land near the Hindenburg-Kattowitz railroad. He was killed in the crash.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial navy {{reached the}} harbour of Miyako on March 20, but anticipating {{the arrival of}} the {{imperial}} ships, the Ezo rebels organized a daring plan to seize the Kōtetsu. Led by Shinsengumi commander Hijikata Toshizō, three warships were dispatched for a surprise attack, in {{what is known as the}} Battle of Miyako Bay. The battle ended in failure for the Tokugawa side, owing to bad weather, <b>engine</b> <b>trouble</b> and the decisive use of a Gatling gun by Imperial troops against samurai boarding parties.|$|E

5|$|Friedrich Carl {{was built}} for the Prussian Navy in the mid-1860s in the French Societé Nouvelles des Forges et Chantiers {{shipyard}} in Toulon. Built as an armored frigate, she mounted her main battery of sixteen 21cm guns on the broadside. Her hull was laid in 1866 and launched in January 1867. The ship was commissioned into the Prussian Navy in October 1867, after which she served with the fleet. During the Franco-Prussian War, the ship formed part of the main German squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Jachmann. <b>Engine</b> <b>trouble,</b> however, plagued the ship {{and two of the}} other three vessels in the squadron; as a result, they made only two sorties from the port of Wilhelmshaven to challenge the French blockade.

5|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} the race, Coulthard was leasing the Learjet of friend David Murray when the {{aeroplane}} developed <b>engine</b> <b>trouble</b> en route to Côte d'Azur International Airport in Nice, and crashed while attempting an emergency landing at Lyon-Satolas Airport, France. Coulthard, his then-girlfriend the American model Heidi Wichlinski and personal trainer/bodyguard Andy Matthews survived; Murray's personal pilot David Saunders and co-pilot Dan Worley died. Coulthard suffered from bruises to his right rib cage and severe grazed elbows in the crash. FIA Formula One Safety and Medical Delegate Sid Watkins declared that Coulthard was passed fit to compete in the race.|$|E
5|$|Braathens South American & Far East Airtransport A/S {{was founded}} on 26 March 1946 by Ludvig G. Braathen through his {{shipping}} company Braathens Rederi. Share capital was , plus loans from the shipping company. Braathens had made good money during World War II with the participation in the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission, and received permission to use US$1 million to purchase aircraft. The idea to start an airline had occurred to Braathen in 1936, when the ship Brajara had <b>engine</b> <b>trouble</b> while en route to Japan. The Japanese shipyards could not guarantee that they could repair the ship, and {{at first it was}} considered whether the ship should be towed to Europe for repairs. The solution chosen was instead to have the necessary piece made in Amsterdam and flown by KLM. Braathen wanted to have an airline that would be able to fly crew and supplies to his and other ships throughout the world—primarily in the Far East.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{presence}} of two small submarine and a destroyer on the Bolshevik side, superior number of auxiliary cruisers advantaged the British ships.On 20 May some first accidents occurred: a seaplane from the tender Aladir Useynov crashed while on reconnaissance mission, meanwhile two ships could not join the British task force (Slava and Bibi-Eybat: both suffering for <b>engine</b> <b>troubles),</b> additional <b>engine</b> <b>troubles</b> forced Sergie and the auxiliary cruiser Zoroaster to turn back.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the great}} French naval superiority, the French had {{conducted}} insufficient pre-war planning for {{an assault on}} the Prussian naval installations, and concluded that it would only be possible with Danish assistance, which was not forthcoming. The four ships, under the command of Vice Admiral Jachmann, made an offensive sortie in early August 1870 out to the Dogger Bank, though they encountered no French warships. Friedrich Carl and the other two broadside ironclads thereafter suffered from chronic <b>engine</b> <b>trouble,</b> which left Arminius alone to conduct operations. Friedrich Carl, Kronprinz, and König Wilhelm stood off the island of Wangerooge {{for the majority of the}} conflict, while Arminius was stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river. On 11 September, the three broadside ironclads were again ready for action; they joined Arminius for another major operation into the North Sea. It too did not encounter French opposition, as the French Navy had by this time returned to France.|$|E
5|$|The 1978 season saw a {{succession}} of retirements for Villeneuve, often after problems with the new Michelin radial tyres. Early in the season, he started on the front row at the United States Grand Prix West, but crashed out of the lead on lap39. Despite calls in the Italian press {{for him to be}} replaced, Ferrari persisted with him. Towards the end of the season, Villeneuve's results improved. He finished second on the road at the Italian Grand Prix, although he was penalised a minute for jumping the start, and ran second at the United States Grand Prix before his engine failed. Finally at the season-ending Canadian Grand Prix, this time at the Circuit Notre Dame Island in Montreal (a circuit that was eventually named after him) Villeneuve scored his first Grand Prix win after Jean-Pierre Jarier's Lotus stopped with <b>engine</b> <b>trouble.</b> To date, he remains the only Canadian to win his home race.|$|E
5|$|The North Weald pair, No. 504 and 257 Squadrons {{engaged the}} Dorniers with 20 Hurricanes. One German pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe {{developed}} <b>engine</b> <b>trouble</b> and lagged {{half a mile}} behind the main bomber stream. His Dornier attracted a swarm of fighters. Eventually Ray Holmes of 504 Squadron, out of bullets, rammed the bomber. The tail came off and air pressure snapped off the outer wings short of the engines. The bomber crashed onto the forecourt of London Victoria station. During its spinning dive, the gravitational force on the Dornier caused its bombs to be released, which hit or landed near to Buckingham Palace nearby, damaging the building. Zehbe bailed out and landed near The Oval and was severely wounded by a civilian mob. He was rescued by the British Army but died of his wounds. Holmes' Hurricane was badly damaged, crashing near the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Holmes bailed out injured but survived.|$|E

The Canadian survived a chaotic race start which took out five drivers {{before the start}} of the race. However, starting lap eight, the Oldsmobile Aurora V8 in Bourbonnais' Dallara IR7 blew. As he stopped down the backstretch his stop caused a yellow flag.|$|R
5|$|The {{eighth and}} last war patrol that U-30 was to {{undertake}} began on 5 August 1940, {{when she left}} Lorient for the North Atlantic. In 26 days, she travelled north of the British Isles, into the North Sea and entered the German port city of Kiel on 30 August 1940. During that time, she sank the Swedish vessel Canton on 9 August and the British steam merchantman Clan Macphee on 16 August 1940. Both of these attacks took place off {{the west coast of}} neutral Ireland. After these successes, however, U-30 once again experienced <b>engine</b> <b>trouble</b> and was forced to end her patrol early, returning to Germany. Before she arrived, Lemp received word that he had been awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for the boat's previous war patrols.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} commenced {{with a wave}} of 234 German dive {{bombers and}} medium bombers attacking Belgrade, escorted by 120 fighters. This force reached Belgrade at 07:00, where it was met by the 51st Fighter Group, without an IK-3 from the 161st Fighter Squadron, that had developed <b>engine</b> <b>trouble</b> after takeoff and was unable to engage. The other five IK-3s were the first to meet the initial bomber wave but they were almost immediately attacked by Bf 109Es of Jagdgeschwader 77. The pilots of the IK-3s claimed five German aircraft and one aircraft from each Yugoslav squadron was lost. Poljanec had claimed a twin-engined bomber and a Bf 109E but when he returned to Zemun in his badly damaged aircraft, he was strafed by a Messerschmitt 110, which further damaged his aircraft and wounded him. After this encounter, only three IK-3s were serviceable, including the IK-3 that had developed engine difficulties prior to the first German wave.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{transferred to}} Port Moresby, New Guinea, {{at the end}} of August 1944 and then to Noemfoor in mid-September, joining Nos.76 and 77 Squadrons as part of No.81 Wing under No.10 Operational Group (later First Tactical Air Force). Three of No.82 Squadron's Kittyhawks crashed due to <b>engine</b> <b>trouble</b> while staging through Nadzab and Tadji. Operating from Kamiri strip on Noemfoor, the squadron flew its first combat mission on 30September, bombing Samate airstrip with aircraft from No.77 Squadron. On 18October, one aircraft was lost to ground fire during an attack on Kai Island, and another was reported missing. It was difficult for No.82 Squadron to stay operational as most of its ground crew remained in Townsville until moving forward the following month; in the meantime, the pilots were responsible for arming and refuelling their aircraft. On 23November, they dive bombed Japanese airfields on Halmahera with aircraft of No.76 Squadron.|$|E
