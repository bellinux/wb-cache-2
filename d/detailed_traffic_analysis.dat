40|$|Abstract. Currently, some coarse {{measures}} like {{global network}} latency {{are used to}} compare routing protocols. These measures do not provide enough insight of traffic distribution among network nodes in presence of different fault regions. This paper presents a <b>detailed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>analysis</b> of f-cube routing algorithm achieved by a especially developed tool. Per-node traffic analysis illustrates the traffic hotspots caused by fault regions and provides a great assistance in developing fault tolerant routing algorithms. Based on such detailed information, a simple yet effective improvement of f-cube is suggested. Moreover, {{the effect of a}} traffic hotspot on the traffic of neighboring nodes and global performance degradation is investigated. To analyze the per-node traffic, some per-node traffic metrics are introduced {{and one of them is}} selected for the rest of work. In an effort to gain deep understanding of the issue of traffic analysis of faulty networks, this paper is the first attempt to investigate per-node traffic around fault regions. ...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{progress}} {{of information technology}} (IT) may provide us with new insights into understanding traffic phenomena, and could help mitigate traffic problems. One of the key applications of IT to traffic and transport analysis is {{the identification of the}} location of moving objects using the Global Positioning System (GPS). It is expected that <b>detailed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>analysis</b> could be carried out using these data. In this article, we first summarize the various applications of probe data in transport analysis. GPS data are merely a sequence of locations, and further data transformation such as map-matching, data-reduction, processing, and reporting is needed to use them effectively. We then discuss the application of bus probe data to evaluating travel time variability and the level of service (LOS) of roads. A methodology for evaluating the road network from the viewpoint of travel time stability and reliability using bus probe data is proposed. Travel time distributions of arbitrary routes are estimated by statistically summing up directly observed multiple travel time distributions. Based on the development of methodologies to estimate travel time distributions of arbitrary routes covered by the bus probe survey, this study proposes an approach to evaluate the LOS of road networks based on the concept of travel time reliability...|$|E

This paper provides an update of the <b>detailed</b> container <b>traffic</b> <b>analysis</b> developed by Notteboom (1997) by extending it to the period 1985 – 2008 and to 78 {{container port}}s. The paper also aims at identifying key trends and issues underlying recent developments in the European container port system. These trends include the formation of multi-port gateway regions, changes in the hinterland orientation of ports and port regionalization processes. While the local hinterland remains the backbone of ports’ traffic positions, a growing demand for routing flexibility fuels competition for distant hinterlands between multi-port gateway regions. The prevailing assumption that containerisation would lead to further port concentration is not a confirmed fact in Europe: the European port system {{and most of its}} multi-port gateway regions witness a gradual cargo deconcentration process. Still, the container handling market remains far more concentrated than other cargo handling segments in the European port system, as there are strong market-related factors supporting a relatively high cargo concentration level in the container sector...|$|R

Collectively, ports in this region constituted a significant 40 % market share of all container traffic through the African continent in 2005. One of the busiest {{container port}}s on the continent, the Port of Durban is located within the Southern African region. The region has seen strong port development in the last 15 years with new ports entering the market or existing ports expanding their supply. Competitive dynamics in the Southern African container port system are however not well researched.

In this report, {{we focused on}} developing a sustainable and low impact street design by following standard traffic codes to redesign Hearst Avenue to accommodate all modes of transportation. The team worked on the section of Hearst Avenue from Oxford Street to La Loma Avenue 2 ̆ 2 ”which is approximately 2640 feet (0. 5 mile) and consists of 8 intersections 2 ̆ 2 ”and developed two designs addressing different street features. These two designs were combined for the final design to incorporate automobile lanes, bicycle lanes, parking spots, and increased sidewalk additions that would not cause excessive traffic congestion or stormwater flooding. The level of street service was well within the desired result, whereas the street layout of vehicle and bicycle lanes demanded more attention. While the design team expected different results, the stormwater analysis portion of the design proved to indicate additional green drainage features {{would not be a}} necessity.

During winter, the removal of snow and ice from streets, roads, and highways is a major maintenance operation. Snow and ice covered roads can paralyze the functioning of the community and pose a considerable threat to the public safety. Prior to 1991, several extensive European studies have been reported on measuring the impact of winter road maintenance and its economic benefits on road users 2 ̆ 7 safety. In the United States, no such study up to the date of this dissertation has been conducted in documenting quantitative data of how effective is the winter road maintenance on road users 2 ̆ 7 safety. In this study, a highway net work of approximately 1250 lane-miles in four different states (New York, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) were selected randomly with the cooperation of the authorities in each state. Data on road characteristics, traffic volumes, snow and ice control operations, and traffic accidents in the four states have been assembled from two winter seasons in New York and one winter season (1990 - 91) in Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. <b>Detailed</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>analysis</b> and adjustments were performed to arrive at estimates of hourly vehicle miles of travel 12 hours before and 12 hours after each sub-event 6.
