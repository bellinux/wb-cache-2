40|$|Previous {{research}} reports that acute alcohol exposure disrupts shoaling {{behavior in the}} zebrafish. The purpose of these studies is to better understand how acute alcohol exposure (0 %, 0. 125 %, 0. 25 %, 0. 5 %, and 1. 0 %) alters zebrafish behavior. The effects of alcohol on aggressive behaviors in humans have been widely researched. Previous research from this lab has shown a bimodal effect of alcohol on shoaling behavior in zebrafish, with 0. 5 % and 2. 0 % (v/v) disrupting shoaling while 1. 0 % and 1. 5 % showing no direct effect. Because shoaling is a social behavior and is altered during acute alcohol exposure, aggressive behavior between fish should be addressed. In this series of experiments we explored alcohol’s effects on aggressive behaviors. In order to address a possible role for alcohol induced aggression {{as it relates to}} shoaling we chose {{to examine the effects of}} acute alcohol exposure on zebrafish pairs. Fish were assessed during <b>initial</b> <b>encounters</b> <b>occurring</b> in our testing apparatus during acute alcohol exposure. Results show a change in biting as a function of all doses. Acute alcohol exposure (0. 5 %) also decreases overall occurrences of chasing and retreating but may increase the duration of each bout. Lastly in a separate experiment we looked at blood alcohol levels as a result of acute alcohol exposure. Acute alcohol exposure has been shown to modulate a variety of behavior...|$|R

40|$|The <b>initial</b> <b>encounter</b> {{between a}} buyer and a seller has {{received}} much attention among practitioners. The {{first time a}} buyer interacts with a seller {{is thought to be}} highly influential. The premise is that buyers form an opinion during this first encounter, or even the first minutes of this encounter. Furthermore these first impressions tend to stay consistent over time (Tapp, 1999). Therefore the practitioner's literature suggests that sellers should create the best first impression possible: by matching and mirroring buyer behaviour (Boe, 2011 a), using nonverbal communication (Goman, 2011) and aligning it with verbal communication (Ramsey, 2003), being groomed (Dumont, 2011), timeliness (Lemons, 2011) and adjusting the handshake (Boe, 2011 b). Although academic research has also indicated that <b>initial</b> <b>encounters</b> are an important first hurdle (Dwyer et al., 1987), a holistic view on an <b>initial</b> <b>encounter</b> between a buyer and a seller in line with practice is still missing. Research shows that <b>initial</b> <b>encounters</b> contain a first impression (Bergeron et al., 2008) that impacts on trustworthiness (Geigenmüller and Greschuchna, 2011). Other constructs researched are perceived similarity (Lichtenthal and Tellefsen, 2001), expertise (Crosby et al., 1990), organisational and personal trustworthiness (Geigenmüller and Greschuchna, 2011). Although research provided an insight into specific causal relationships, a framework indicating the relative importance of these relationships is not available. Therefore a qualitative approach is developed to provide such a holistic description, as experienced by buyers. The methodology chosen is a phenomenological study. As research in industrial marketing in this form is rare, specific advantages of this type of research are currently underused (Wagner et al., 2010). Therefore providing a research project using this approach is a contribution on its own account. Practitioners {{will be able to use}} the outcomes as a means to reflect on their understanding of <b>initial</b> <b>encounters.</b> The outcomes can serve as a stimulus for evaluating current working methods and training. The purpose of this phenomenological study is to describe the essence (Moustakas, 1994) of the <b>initial</b> <b>encounter</b> between a buyer and a seller as experienced by buyers. The <b>initial</b> <b>encounter</b> between a buyer and a seller is defined as the first time a representative of an organisation who is responsible for the procurement, meets a representative responsible for the selling function of another organisation face-to-face. The central question of this research is: what is a buyer's essence of a lived experience of an <b>initial</b> <b>encounter</b> with a seller? First a short literature review is presented, this outlines the main issues addressed in current research regarding <b>initial</b> <b>encounters</b> in a business-to-business context. Secondly the methodology will be addressed. Next the data collected will be presented in the form of textural and structural themes. In the discussion composite textural description, composite structural descriptions and essence of the <b>initial</b> <b>encounter</b> as experienced by buyers are provided.

Approaching a discussion about the relative merits of translation versus interpretation from this perspective, that emphasizes the time at which the conversation occurs, would suggest that linguistic accuracy is much more important in formal hearings, while interpretation is crucial during the <b>initial</b> <b>encounter,</b> because it is during this period of negotiation that a sensitive and qualified interpreter can keep a claimant from incriminating herself or mis-communicating the situation to authority...|$|R
40|$|SummaryCadherins are Ca 2 +-dependent cell-cell {{adhesion}} proteins with an extracellular region of five domains (EC 1 to EC 5). Adhesion is mediated by “strand swapping” of a conserved tryptophan residue in position 2 between EC 1 domains of opposing cadherins, but {{the formation of}} this structure is not well understood. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and single-molecule force measurements with the atomic force microscope, we demonstrate that cadherins initially interact via EC 1 domains without swapping tryptophan- 2 to form a weak Ca 2 + dependent <b>initial</b> <b>encounter</b> complex that has 25 % of the bond strength of a strand-swapped dimer. We suggest that cadherin dimerization proceeds via an induced fit mechanism where the monomers first form a tryptophan- 2 independent <b>initial</b> <b>encounter</b> complex and then undergo subsequent conformational changes to form the final strand-swapped dimer...|$|R
