40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{enormous}} {{progress in}} gene therapy for breast cancer, an optimal systemic vehicle for delivering gene {{products to the}} target tissue is still lacking. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether AC 133 + progenitor cells (APC) can be used as both gene delivery vehicles and cellular probes for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we used superparamagentic iron oxide (SPIO) -labeled APCs to carry the human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) gene to the sites of implanted breast cancer in mouse model. In vivo real time tracking of these cells was performed by MRI and expression of hNIS was determined by Tc- 99 m pertechnetate (Tc- 99 m) scan. Results Three million human breast cancer (MDA-MB- 231) cells were subcutaneously implanted in the right flank of nude mice. APCs, isolated from fresh human cord blood, were <b>genetically</b> <b>transformed</b> to carry the hNIS gene using adenoviral vectors and magnetically labeled with ferumoxides-protamine sulfate (FePro) complexes. Magnetically labeled <b>genetically</b> <b>transformed</b> cells were administered intravenously in tumor bearing mice when tumors reached 0. 5 cm in the largest dimension. MRI and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were acquired 3 and 7 days after cell injection, with a 7 Tesla animal MRI system and a custom built micro-SPECT using Tc- 99 m, respectively. Expression of hNIS in accumulated cells was determined by staining with anti-hNIS antibody. APCs were efficiently labeled with ferumoxide-protamine sulfate (FePro) complexes and transduced with hNIS gene. Our study showed not only the accumulation of intravenously administered <b>genetically</b> <b>transformed,</b> magnetically labeled APCs in the implanted breast cancer, but also the expression of hNIS gene at the tumor site. Tc- 99 m activity ratio (tumor/non-tumor) was significantly different between animals that received non-transduced and transduced cells (P Conclusion This study indicates that <b>genetically</b> <b>transformed,</b> magnetically labeled APCs can be used both as delivery vehicles and cellular probes for detecting in vivo migration and homing of cells. Furthermore, they can potentially be used as a gene carrier system for the treatment of tumor or other diseases. </p...|$|R

40|$|By {{naturally}} occurring gene-transformation Ri-plasmids of Agrobacterium rhizogenes have been {{integrated into the}} plant genome of Chamomillo recutita, thereby inducing the formation of hairy roots. Clones with the best biosynthetic potential were multiplied for phytochemical investigations. The amounts of terpenoid and polyene compounds in the <b>genetically</b> <b>transformed</b> cultures were compared with those in in-vivo plants. In Hungary a wild chamomile population was found which contained significant amount of (-) -alpha-bisabolol in the oil from the inflorescence. We used biotechnological methods to preserve the genome of this wild type. Transformed chamomile root cultures were obtained by infection of sterile organized cultures with Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains #A- 4,# 15834, and #R- 1601. Hairy roots freed from bacteria were cultivated on solid medium and then in liquid, hormone-free, B 5 and MS media. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the essential oil was examined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The volatile compounds were identified by comparing their retention times with those of authentic standards and of essential oils of known composition, and by peak enrichment. Confirmation of identity was achieved by comparison of mass spectra with those {{reported in the literature}} and those of reference compounds. The amount of each component {{as a percentage of the}} total was determined by area normalization. GC and GC-MS studies showed that <b>genetically</b> <b>transformed</b> chamomile cultures generated the terpenoid and polyene compounds most characteristic of the parent plant.

40|$|Historically, {{the members}} of the Agrobacterium genus have been {{considered}} the only bacterial species naturally able to transfer and integrate DNA into the genomes of their eukaryotic hosts. Yet, increasing evidence suggests that this ability to <b>genetically</b> <b>transform</b> eukaryotic host cells might be more widespread in the bacterial world. Indeed, analyses of accumulating genomic data reveal cases of horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to eukaryotes and suggest that it represents a significant force in adaptive evolution of eukaryotic species. Specifically, recent reports indicate that bacteria other than Agrobacterium, such as Bartonella henselae (a zoonotic pathogen), Rhizobium etli (a plant-symbiotic bacterium related to Agrobacterium), or even Escherichia coli, have the ability to <b>genetically</b> <b>transform</b> their host cells under laboratory conditions. This DNA transfer relies on type IV secretion systems (T 4 SSs), the molecular machines that transport macromolecules during conjugative plasmid transfer and also during transport of proteins and/or DNA to the eukaryotic recipient cells.

40|$|The world {{population}} is increasing {{at an alarming}} rate and is expected to increase from 6. 5 billion at present to 7. 5 billion by 2025. Most of this population lives in the rural areas in the developing countries where poverty, food insecurity and nutritional deficiencies are the major problems. Low crop productivity, limited use of inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides and losses due to biotic and abiotic stress factors are a major constraint to increase production and productivity of crops.

40|$|Background: Recently it {{has been}} shown that Ensifer adhaerens can be used as a plant {{transformation}} technology, transferring genes into several plant genomes when equipped with a Ti plasmid. For this study, we have sequenced the genome of Ensifer adhaerens OV 14 (OV 14) and compared it with those of Agrobacterium tumefaciens C 58 (C 58) and Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 (1021); the latter of which has also demonstrated a capacity to <b>genetically</b> <b>transform</b> crop genomes, albeit at significantly reduced frequencies. Results: The 7. 7 Mb OV 14 genome comprises two chromosomes and two plasmids. All protein coding regions in the OV 14 genome were functionally grouped based on an eggNOG database. No genes homologous to the A. tumefaciens Ti plasmid vir genes appeared to be present in the OV 14 genome. Unexpectedly, OV 14 and 1021 were found to possess homologs to chromosomal based genes cited as essential to A. tumefaciens T-DNA transfer. Of significance, genes that are non-essential but exert a positive influence on virulence and the ability to <b>genetically</b> <b>transform</b> host genomes were identified in OV 14 but were absent from the 1021 genome. Conclusions: This study reveals the presence of homologs to chromosomally based Agrobacterium genes that support T-DNA transfer within the genome of OV 14 and other alphaproteobacteria. The sequencing and analysis of the OV 14 genome increases our understanding of T-DNA transfer by non-Agrobacterium species and creates a platform for the continued improvement of Ensifer-mediated transformation (EMT) ...|$|R
