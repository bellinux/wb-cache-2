25|$|There {{are limits}} to electrophoretic techniques. Since passing current through a gel causes heating, gels may melt during electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is {{performed}} in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. There are also limitations in determining the molecular weight by SDS-PAGE, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{trying to find the}} MW of an unknown protein. There are certain biological variables that are difficult or impossible to minimize and can affect the electrophoretic migration. Such factors include protein structure, post-translational modifications, and amino acid composition. For example, tropomyosin is an acidic protein that migrates abnormally on SDS-PAGE gels. This is because the acidic residues are repelled by the negatively charged SDS, leading to an inaccurate mass-to-charge ratio and migration. Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.|$|E

Producer Jane Featherstone first {{suggested}} Olivia Colman {{for the role of}} Ellie Miller, to which Chibnall (having also had her in mind) immediately agreed. Chibnall then specifically wrote the role of Ellie Miller for Colman, hoping she would agree to join the cast. Colman remained Chibnall's first choice to play Miller, and there was consensus among the producers to offer the job to her without the need for an audition. Colman says she was immediately drawn to the role: [...] "From the off I really liked the idea of the story, a hard story and an upsetting one, but I liked the idea of a whole community being affected by something and I liked the character of Ellie. ... And I liked Ellie. I find it hard to play a character if I can't feel any of me in them. <b>Especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to be playing that person through the whole series you need to feel that connection." [...] She was also highly impressed with the script she read, calling the script one she [...] "couldn't put down" [...] and that she turned the pages [...] "frantically" [...] because it was such a good read. Colman says she also had heard that David Tennant and actress Vicky McClure were under consideration for roles as well, and she wanted very much to work with them. She accepted the role immediately after reading the script.|$|E

60|$|But for the herd, Plotinus cannot {{say that}} there is {{anything}} divine in them. And thus it gradually comes out in all Neoplatonist writings which I have yet examined, that the Divine only exists in a man, in proportion as he is conscious of its existence in him. From which spring two conceptions of the Divine in man. First, is it a part of him, if it is dependent for its existence on his consciousness of it? Or is it, as Philo, Plutarch, Marcus Aurelius would have held, as the Christians held, something independent of him, without him, a Logos or Word speaking to his reason and conscience? With this question Plotinus grapples, earnestly, shrewdly, fairly. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> wish to see how he does it, you should read the fourth and fifth books of the sixth Ennead, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> lucky enough to light on a copy of that rare book, Taylor's faithful though crabbed translation.|$|R

500|$|Positive reviews {{praised the}} film for {{presenting}} {{a more realistic}} approach to the Boogeyman and eschewing CGI, {{both of which were}} considered improvements over its predecessor. Its death scenes were highly praised for being extremely violent and gory. Many reviewers also recognized that the film exceeded their expectations despite its direct-to-video status and low budget. Shawn Lealos of CHUD.com gave the film a score of 6.8 out of ten, stating that it was [...] "a very solid little horror flick that forgoes the ridiculous CGI and hokum supernatural aspects of the first movie, as well as the restraints of PG-13." [...] In a similar review, Matthew Stern of PopMatters praised the film in comparison to its predecessor, giving it eight stars out of ten, with a consensus reading: [...] "A film that bucks the stigma of direct-to-DVD sequels, this unyieldingly dark and bloody feature will surprise <b>you,</b> <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> unfortunate enough to catch the first one." [...] David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews also praised Boogeyman 2 over the first film, particularly for its [...] "satisfying kill sequences" [...] and an entertaining supporting cast. While he criticized the middle half as [...] "uneventful," [...] he felt that the film [...] "recovers nicely for a surprisingly enthralling third act" [...] and gave it 2.5/4 stars.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the eve of}} the Euripides {{examination}} in the Upper Fourth. Euripides is {{not difficult}} compared to some other authors, but he does demand a certain amount of preparation. Bradshaw was a youth who did less preparation than anybody I have ever seen, heard of, or read of, partly because he preferred to peruse a novel under the table during prep., but chiefly, I think, because he had reduced cribbing in form to such an exact science that he loved it for its own sake, and would no sooner have come tamely into school with a prepared lesson than a sportsman would shoot a sitting bird. It was not the marks that he cared for. He despised them. What he enjoyed was the refined pleasure of swindling under a master's very eye. At the trial the judge, who had, so ran report, been himself rather badly bitten by the Ham Sandwich Company, put the case briefly and neatly in the words, 'You appear to revel in villainy for villainy's sake,' and I am almost certain that I saw the beginnings of a gratified smile on Frederick's expressive face as he heard the remark. The rest of our study--the juniors at St Austin's pigged in quartettes--were in a state of considerable mental activity on account of this Euripides examination. There had been House-matches during the preceding fortnight, and House-matches are not a help to study, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> on the very fringe of the cock-house team, as I was. By dint of practising every minute of spare time, I had got the eleventh place for my fielding. And, better still, I had caught two catches in the second innings, one of them a regular gallery affair, and both off the captain's bowling. It was magnificent, but it was not Euripides, and I wished now that it had been. Mellish, our form-master, had an unpleasant habit of coming down with both feet, as it were, on members of his form who failed in the book-papers.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, always {{recollect}} that {{to educate}} rightly {{is not a}} simple and easy thing, but a complex and extremely difficult thing, the hardest task which devolves on adult life. The rough-and-ready style of domestic government is indeed practicable by the meanest and most uncultivated intellects. Slaps and sharp words are penalties that suggest themselves alike to the least reclaimed barbarian and the stolidest peasant. Even brutes can use this method of discipline; as you may see in the growl and half-bite with which a bitch will check a too-exigeant puppy. But if you would carry out with success a rational and civilised system, you must be prepared for considerable mental exertion--for some study, some ingenuity, some patience, some self-control. You will have habitually to consider what are the results which in adult life follow certain kinds of acts; and you must then devise methods by which parallel results shall be entailed on the parallel acts of your children. It will daily be needful to analyse the motives of juvenile conduct--to distinguish between acts that are really good and those which, though simulating them, proceed from inferior impulses; while you will have to be ever on your guard against the cruel mistake not unfrequently made, of translating neutral acts into transgressions, or ascribing worse feelings than were entertained. You must more or less modify your method to suit the disposition of each child; and must be prepared to make further modifications as each child's disposition enters on a new phase. Your faith will often be taxed to maintain the requisite perseverance in a course which seems to produce little or no effect. <b>Especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> dealing with children who have been wrongly treated, you must be prepared for a lengthened trial of patience before succeeding with better methods; since that which is not easy even where a right state of feeling has been established from the beginning, becomes doubly difficult when a wrong state of feeling has to be set right. Not only will you have constantly to analyse the motives of your children, but you will have to analyse your own motives--to discriminate between those internal suggestions springing from a true parental solicitude and those which spring from your own selfishness, your love of ease, your lust of dominion. And then, more trying still, you will have not only to detect, but to curb these baser impulses. In brief, you will have to carry on your own higher education {{at the same time that}} you are educating your children. Intellectually you must cultivate to good purpose that most complex of subjects--human nature and its laws, as exhibited in your children, in yourself, and in the world. Morally, you must keep in constant exercise your higher feelings, and restrain your lower. It is a truth yet remaining to be recognised, that the last stage in the mental development of each man and woman is to be reached only through a proper discharge of the parental duties. And when this truth is recognised, it will be seen how admirable is the arrangement through which human beings are led by their strongest affections to subject themselves to a discipline that they would else elude.|$|E
