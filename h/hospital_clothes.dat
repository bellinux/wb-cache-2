5000|$|The Queensland Government did {{not require}} women to take {{employment}} in war industries as they had in Britain, and full-time employment for women did not significantly increase. Relatively small numbers of women were accepted as military nurses, and only after prolonged lobbying were the Voluntary Aid Detachments of the Australian Red Cross able to send units to overseas hospitals. It was in voluntary organisations that women made their direct and most significant contributions to the war effort. These organisations took on the responsibility of providing comforts for sick and wounded soldiers here and abroad, and providing frontline troops with morale-building gifts and articles of clothing. The Red Cross Society began work almost immediately upon the declaration of war. From initial knitting circles, the scope of Red Cross support expanded rapidly to include teaching handcrafts to convalescent soldiers, mending <b>hospital</b> <b>clothes</b> and providing food and other necessary supplies to local and overseas military hospitals. So strong was the mobilisation of Red Cross [...] "kitchen ladies" [...] {{that in addition to}} providing food for the Rosemount, Kangaroo Point and Lytton military hospitals, they were also able to supplement food to asylums, orphanages, and public hospitals. Other voluntary organisations - the National Council of Women (which was an amalgam of 41 other societies), the Queensland Soldiers' Comfort Fund, the Babies of the Allies Clothing Society, the Women's Mutual Service Club, the Soldier's Pastime Club, Sailor's and Soldiers Residential Club, and the Christmas Box Fund to name but a few - provided similar services. The social and economic value of such voluntary work was considerable.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNylon/cotton (NYCO) {{fabric is}} one of the most {{applicable}} fabrics in producing clothes. Its appropriate properties such as high abrasion resistance and comfort caused to be used in labor cloths, uniform and dressing. Accordingly, in this research NYCO fabric finished with ZnO/ TiO 2 to investigate the improvement of light and washing fastness. Meanwhile we try to expand the application of this fabric in other sections like <b>hospital</b> <b>clothes</b> by adding antibacterial property. Therefore, nano ZnO/TiO 2 in different concentrations (30, 40, 50 & 60 ppm) was applied and cured to the fabric then handling, color appearance, light and washing fastness and antimicrobial properties were evaluated. SEM was used to assess the distribution of nanocomposite. The results represent considerable improvement in light and washing fastness. In addition there is no change in handling and color appearance. It is also indicated the highest antibacterial property against E. Coli and S. Aureus which was appeared at 60 ppm...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{framework}} Nowadays, {{obesity is}} an important problem of contemporary civilization. Number of patients with obesity still increases among children and adults respectively. A number of patients suffering from obesity grows also in hospitals, equally in every hospital department. Obesity is a severe metabolic disease influencing life and health of a human. Obesity triggers many health-threatening complications, e. g. cardiovascular, orthopedic, tumor or gastrointestinal diseases, extending a stay of the patient in hospital. First part of the thesis {{is focused on the}} medical aspect of the obesity. This chapter involves prevention of obesity, risk factors influencing obesity, complications of obesity and its treatment. The part dealing with theoretical obesity treatment is divided into surgical treatment, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment. The second part of the thesis concentrates on the issue of nursing care in the treatment of obese patient. This chapter involves the procedure of diagnostic examination by nurse, complications in communication, in self-sufficiency, in hygiene, in skin and nail care, wound treatment and complication in secretion and nourishment of the patient. Aim of the thesis To investigate problems related to nursing care provided to obese patients Research questions Research question # 1 : Which problems are the most common for nursing staff while providing care to obese patients? Research question # 2 : Which problems are the most common for obese patients while admitted to hospital? Methodology: In this bachelor thesis, qualitative form of investigation has been used based on semi-structured dialogues with 10 respondents in total. In order to contact patients in hospital, formal application to execute a research survey has been sent to chosen hospital. The application was approved by the head nurse of the hospital {{as well as by the}} head nurse of the surgical, orthopedic and internal department. Five out of all respondents were nurses of surgical and internal departments and 5 respondents were patients hospitalized in the orthopedic department. General Nurses were asked to answer 11 questions focused on most common problems related to care of obese patients. Interrogated patients were asked to answer 9 questions focused on complications related to their hospitalization and obesity. Answers have been voice recorded and then categorized. Results It results from the conclusions of the first research question, that the patients are aware of problems connected to the nursing care and they wish to reform it namely in the area of improved facilities in hospital which would be more convenient for obese patients. Patients consider transfer beds, bathrooms, <b>hospital</b> <b>clothes</b> and bed linen to be unsatisfactory. The answer to the second research question "Which problems are the most common for obese patients while admitted to hospital?" is that nurses have the most severe problems with the transfer of patients from their bed. When taking venous blood, nurses have problems to find a suitable vein to drain blood. When providing help or assisting to the hygienic care, nurses face problems associated to the laboriously accessible body parts of an obese patient. When dealing with nutrition, nurses usually have problems with the non-observance of diet measures prescribed by doctor, and while assisting to the bowel movement, they face difficult manipulation with obese patients. Moreover, I found out that nurses require the assistance of other staff members when providing particularly demanding nursing care to the obese patient (e. g. hygiene, bowel movement, setting into position). Horizontal bar and placemats show to be the most used tool for nurses to manipulate with the obese patient...|$|E

Este trabalho trata da análise dos resultados obtidos na intervenção ergonômica de uma equipe de ergonomia, em uma lavanderia hospitalar, com o objetivo de descrever a relação entre o modo de funcionamento desta lavanderia e sua relação com problemas de saúde. A lavanderia é o setor de processamento de roupas hospitalares que possui grande importância para o bom funcionamento do hospital, já que distribuí roupa higienizada com qualidade, boa aparência e livre de agentes patogênicos. Foi realizado um estudo ergonômico baseado na Análise Ergonômica do Trabalho (AET) e por meio deste trabalho, estamos mostrando o funcionamento de uma Lavanderia Hospitalar que possui características específicas as quais buscamos identificar sob a perspectiva de compreender a prática da intervenção ergonômica. Metodologia. Utilizamos a pesquisa sobre a prática como metodologia de estudo, sendo colocado em prática durante o prazo em que a intervenção aconteceu e, assim, nos parece suficiente para atingir os objetivos de nossa dissertação que é: descrever a situação como em modo degradado. Resultados. Na tentativa de compreender o funcionamento em modo degradado, procuramos inicialmente identificá-lo na {{literatura}} em seus diversos aspectos, pois ele sempre existiu e sempre foi citado, porém com outras denominações, dessa forma, procuramos analisar a realidade da Lavanderia Hospitalar inserida no próprio hospital e relacionando-a aos problemas de saúde existentes, pois as pessoas continuam ficando doentes. Para isto, procedemos a uma explanação dos resultados obtidos com a análise da demanda. Conclusão. O uso da metodologia mostrou-se adequada para desvendar algumas ações realizadas pelos trabalhadores com o objetivo de concretizar, na medida do possível, a produção e a qualidade do serviço final na atual lavanderia hospitalar. O funcionamento em modo degradado é uma possível explicação para que a produção e/ou a qualidade da produção, pois nem sempre o esquematizado teoricamente ocorre; portanto, aquilo que poderia ser evitado, pode acabar acontecendo. This work {{deals with}} the analyze of the gotten results in an ergonomic intervention of an ergonomic team, in a hospital laundry, {{with the purpose of}} describing the connection between the way of functioning of this laundry and its relation with the workers healthy problems. The laundry is the processing sector of <b>hospital</b> <b>clothes</b> that posses great importance for the good functioning of the hospital, because is distributes hygienically clothes with quality, good looking and free of pathogenic agents. It was carried through an ergonomic study, based on Ergonomic Analyzes of Work (EAW) and through this work, we are showing the functioning of a Hospital Laundry that posses specific characteristics that we intent to identify under the perspective to understand the practice of ergonomic intervention. Methodology. We used the research over the practice as methodology of study, being placed in practice during the stated period where intervention happened and, thus, it seems enough to reach the objectives of this work that is to describe the situation in degraded way. Results. In the attempt to understand the functioning in degraded way, we initially intended to identify it in the literature in its diverse aspects, because it always existed and always has been cited, but with other denominations, in this way, we look for analyze the reality of the Hospital Laundry inserted in the hospital and relating it with the existing problems, because the people continue being sick. For this, we proceed to one explanation of the results gotten with the analyze of the demand. Conclusion. The use of the methodology revealed adequate to unmask some action carried through by the workers with the objective to materialize, in the measure of possible, the production {{and the quality of the}} final service, in the current hospital laundry. The functioning in degraded way is one of the possible explanations to the production and/or the quality of production, because not always the theoretically schematized occurs; therefore, what could be prevented, can happen in the end...|$|E

50|$|The {{conditions}} in Dachau, as {{at all the}} former concentration camps and the Displaced Persons (DP) camps, were often quite bad with overcrowding and inadequate food, shelter, clothing, and medical supplies. On July 1, 1945, at the Feldafing Displaced Persons camp near Dachau, Klausner and Zalman Grinberg, a survivor of Dachau, established the Central Committee of the Liberated Jews in the U.S. Zone of Germany as the official representative body of the Jewish DPs. The purpose of the Central Committee was to champion {{the interests of the}} Jewish DPs and to draw attention to their plight. Klausner was horrified {{by the fact that the}} survivors were still living in the camps in much the same conditions as they had under the Nazis. He wrote letters of protest including detailed reports about these conditions and sent them up the army chain of command. Klausner also wrote to various Jewish organizations in the United States, which he felt were not doing all that they could to help the survivors. Klausner did whatever he felt was necessary to get the Jewish DPs what they needed including setting up Jewish <b>hospitals</b> and procuring <b>clothes,</b> food and medical supplies and, while he did a great deal of good, his actions often put him at odds with the army, the Red Cross, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and various Jewish organizations. His relations with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) were particularly fraught, with the JDC successfully removing him from Germany, although he soon returned, this time to Kassel, Germany.|$|R
