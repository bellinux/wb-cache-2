5|$|<b>High</b> <b>levels</b> of {{molybdenum}} {{can interfere}} with the body's uptake of copper, producing copper deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in urine. Ruminants that consume <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of molybdenum suffer from diarrhea, stunted growth, anemia, and achromotrichia (loss of fur pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection. The effective copper deficiency, can be aggravated by excess sulfur.|$|E
5|$|Research, in 2008, by {{scientists}} from Pennsylvania State University found <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of the pesticides fluvalinate and coumaphos in samples of wax from hives, {{as well as}} lower levels of 70 other pesticides.

All enterococcal blood culture isolates at Royal Brisbane Hospital have been screened by agar dilution for <b>high</b> <b>level</b> {{resistance to}} gentamicin and strepto-mycin since 1989. Of 110 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 16 % displayed <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resistance to gentamicin and 10 % showed <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resistance to streptomycin. Four isolates had <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resistance to both antibiotics. None of 23 Enterococcus faecium isolates displayed <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resis-tance to gentamicin and only one to streptomycin. Two Enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to amoxycillin but none to vancomycin. There has been no apparent increase in <b>high</b> <b>level</b> aminoglycoside resistance from 1989 to 1996. <b>High</b> <b>level</b> gentamicin resistant isolates were relatively more common in liver transplant patients.

40|$|ABSTRACT-In present time’s <b>High</b> <b>level</b> clones (HLC) is an {{emerging}} concept {{that uses a}} hierarchical organization of fine gained clone fragments (Simple clones) to form coarser-grained clones (<b>High</b> <b>Level</b> Clone). Different research groups categorize clones with respect to different contexts. In this paper we review all such available categories of clones and present them {{in the form of}} a <b>High</b> <b>Level</b> Clone Classification. Classification can serve various purposes like studying the more frequently occurring <b>high</b> <b>level</b> clones, prioritizing different types of <b>high</b> <b>level</b> clones, devising re-engineering strategies for different types of <b>high</b> <b>level</b> clones etc [...] For this classification of HLC we develop a fuzzy rule-based system and also visualize the results.

5|$|A {{study of}} trace {{elements}} in mushrooms {{in the eastern}} Black Sea Region of Turkey found E.sinuatum to have {{the highest levels of}} copper (64.8 ± 5.9μg/g dried material—insufficient to be toxic) and zinc (198μg/g) recorded. Caps and stalks tested in an area with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of mercury in southeastern Poland showed it to bioaccumulate much higher levels of mercury than other fungi. The element was also found in <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> in the humus-rich substrate. Entoloma sinuatum also accumulates arsenic-containing compounds. Of the roughly 40μg of arsenic present per gram of fresh mushroom tissue, about 8% was arsenite and the other 92% was arsenate.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2005 review, {{due to the}} <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of {{mortality}} and morbidity caused by malaria—especially the P.falciparum species—it has placed the greatest selective pressure on the human genome in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, {{and the absence of}} Duffy antigens on red blood cells.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} role {{of the immune system}} is to identify and eliminate tumors. This is called immune surveillance. The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at <b>high</b> <b>levels,</b> transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors called melanomas. A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.|$|E

5|$|Carménère {{favors a}} long growing season in {{moderate}} to warm climates. During harvest {{time and the}} winter period the vine fares poorly if it is introduced to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of rain or irrigation water. This is particularly true in poor-soil plantings where the vine would need more water. Over-watering during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of the grape. The grape naturally develops <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of sugar before the tannins achieve ripeness. If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance. Carménère buds and flowers three to seven days later than Merlot and the yield is {{lower than that of}} the latter grape. The Carménère leaves turn to crimson before dropping.|$|E
