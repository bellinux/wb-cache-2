5|$|After {{resuming}} production, Navarro {{questioned the}} methods of the Chili Peppers' recording procedures. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> such {{a considerable amount of}} jamming was involved with the album's conception. Various qualms followed, and the process soon became uncomfortable for the band. Months went by, and only small amounts of material were written. Kiedis made a trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan in December, where his family realized he'd resumed an active addiction once again. He returned to Hollywood in late January 1995, when he finally finished recording his vocals. The rest of the recording was completed within the next month.|$|E
5|$|Johnson began {{thinking}} of life after basketball while still {{playing with the}} Lakers. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> so many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he {{had a meeting with}} Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into business, a high-end sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him to listen to his customers and find out what products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban communities, creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through his movie theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. Johnson has also invested in urban California real estate and financial service companies catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2006-07, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, then the tallest building in Brooklyn, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers {{created the}} size of each robot with {{the size of}} their vehicle mode in mind, {{supporting}} the Transformer's rationale for their choice of disguise on Earth. The concept of traveling protoforms was developed by Roberto Orci when <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> [...] "aliens who moonlight as vehicles need other vehicles to travel". This reflected a desire to move to a more alien look, away from the [...] "blocky" [...] Transformers. Another major influence in the designs was samurai armor, returning full-circle to the Japanese origins of the toy line. The robots also had to look alien, or else they would have resembled other cinematic robots made in the image of man.|$|E
500|$|Attorneys {{with the}} office of the Texas Attorney General took on Mitchell's case after being {{contacted}} by the TMB. Assistant Attorney General David Glickler later said that the case was the most bizarre he had seen in an 11-year stint {{with the office}}. [...] "We're used to dealing with cases where public officials have enriched themselves {{at the expense of the}} office and the public trust, like bribery and theft. But there was no financial benefit to the bad actors in this case." [...] The jury returned with a not guilty verdict after an hour of deliberation. Those present in the courtroom said that each juror approached Mitchell after the verdict and hugged her. In comments he made after the trial, jury foreman Harley Tyler said <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> the nurses were arrested. ANA president Rebecca Patton said that the verdict was [...] "a resounding win on behalf of patient safety." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of Carmen continued through succeeding generations of American opera-goers; {{by the beginning}} of 2011 the Met alone had performed it almost a thousand times. It enjoyed similar success in other American cities and {{in all parts of the}} world, in many different languages. Carmen's habanera from act 1, and the toreador's song [...] "Votre toast" [...] from act 2, are among the most popular and best-known of all operatic arias, the latter [...] "a splendid piece of swagger" [...] according to Newman, [...] "against which the voices and the eyebrows of purists have long been raised in vain". Most of the productions outside France followed the example created in Vienna and incorporated lavish ballet interludes and other spectacles, a practice which Mahler abandoned in Vienna when he revived the work there in 1900. In 1919 Bizet's [...] aged contemporary Camille Saint-Saëns was still complaining about the [...] "strange idea" [...] of adding a ballet, which he considered [...] "a hideous blemish in that masterpiece", and <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> Bizet's widow, at that time still living, permitted it.|$|E

500|$|Thomas W. Lynch {{first had}} the idea for South of Nowhere {{when one of his}} close {{conservative}} friends told Lynch that his son had just come out to him.

[...] When Lynch heard this, he says, he [...] "knew there was a series in there about identity." [...] <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> such a noteworthy eventan adolescent's coming out to their parentshad never before been explored as an ongoing subject on a television series. He [...] "sat with the idea for a few days" [...] and then wrote an outline of the show's pilot over a few weeks. In an effort to maintain authenticity in depicting teenage experiences, Lynch spoke to high school counselors and asked drama students at a Los Angeles high school for feedback. He pitched the serieswhich he was then calling [...] "Out"to The N executives Amy Friedman and Essie Chambers, who then commissioned him to write the pilot script.|$|E

Flandez and Lynch both praised Mike's singing; Lynch said his [...] "voice sounded great", and Flandez declared that [...] "Mike has really come into his own as a singer". For [...] "Let Me Love You", Lynch wrote that [...] "Artie busted out some serious sex appeal" [...] and gave the [...] "spot-on smooth" [...] performance a [...] "B+". He also described Artie as [...] "effortlessly convincing" [...] on the song. Slezak bestowed an [...] "A−" [...] and said, [...] "Artie finally finds an R jam that lets him get his swag on and fits his voice to a tee!" [...] Votta made mention of [...] "Kurt, Sam, Puck and Mike doing an impressive job as boyband style backup", but Chaney called the performance, including the choreography, [...] "underwhelming" [...] {{and gave it}} a [...] "C" [...] grade.|$|E

2500|$|Darwin was {{questioning}} {{from the}} outset, {{and in his}} first zoology notes <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> deep-ocean plankton had been created with so much beauty for little purpose as {{no one could see}} them. He saw landforms as supporting Lyell's Uniformitarianism which explained features as the outcome of a gradual process over huge periods of time, and quickly showed a gift for theorising about the geology he was examining. He concluded that the land had indeed risen, and referred to loose rock deposits as [...] "part of the long disputed Diluvium". Around 1825 both Lyell and Sedgwick had supported William Buckland's Catastrophism which postulated diluvialism to reconcile findings with the Biblical account of Noah's ark, but by 1830 evidence had shown them that the [...] "diluvium" [...] had come from a series of local processes. They still distinguished between diluvial and alluvial deposits, but Sedgwick no longer thought these deposits were connected with Noah's flood by the time he taught Darwin, though the debate continued. Darwin's notes show him increasingly discounting [...] "debacles" [...] to account for such formations. It was only later that glaciation was accepted as the source of these deposits.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{hijacking}} progressed, {{the passengers}} recognised the personalities of the hijackers. Claude Burgniard, a flight attendant, recalled {{that the crew}} and passengers gave nicknames to the hijackers [...] "to make things simpler." [...] Yahia, the leader, had given his name, so the passengers called him by that name. According to Burgniard, Lotfi had a [...] "peculiar" [...] character, [...] "was always on a knife edge," [...] and [...] "the most fanatic" [...] and [...] "the most fundamentalist" [...] of the hijackers. Therefore, he received the nickname [...] "Madman" [...] from the passengers. According to Burgniard, Lotfi was the hijacker who insisted that the passengers follow Islamic law. Lotfi found women having their heads uncovered [...] "intolerable," [...] making him very angry. One hijacker did not give his name to the passengers, so they called him [...] "Bill." [...] Burgniard stated that Bill was [...] "a little bit simple" [...] and [...] "more of a goatherd than a terrorist." [...] She said {{his role as a}} hijacker was [...] "an error in casting." [...] Burgniard remembered that the occupants wondered why Bill was there and that they saw Bill appearing as if <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> he was there, as well. The hijacker nicknamed [...] "The Killer" [...] shot the hostages whom the hijackers had targeted.|$|E
