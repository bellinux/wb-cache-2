The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the perceived potential positive and negative outcomes of selected dimensions of educational vouchers in Illinois by public education providers. A survey instrument was developed by the researcher after a thorough study of the literature. The survey instrument was divided into six categories of questions: organization of <b>educational</b> <b>voucher</b> programs, administration and finance of <b>educational</b> <b>voucher</b> programs, minority issues under an <b>educational</b> <b>voucher</b> program, school improvement issues, private sectarian and non-sectarian school participation in an <b>educational</b> <b>voucher</b> program, and teacher-administrator participation in an <b>educational</b> <b>voucher</b> program. The population for this study included all Illinois public school superintendents, school board presidents, and Illinois Education Association presidents employed or elected in Illinois school districts for the 1991 - 1992 school year. A random sample of 300 superintendents, 300 school board presidents, and 250 association presidents was drawn. Completed surveys were returned by 195 superintendents for a 65 % response rate; 54 school board presidents for an 18 % response rate; and 44 association presidents for an 18 % response rate. The analysis of variance statistic was utilized to compare the responses of respondents within their own group. In all instances, there was no significant difference in their responses when analyzed by 13 demographic variables. The responses of all groups were quite similar. Responses to 5 questions (24, 33, 34, 35, and 38) showed significant differences at the. 05 level of confidence utilizing the chi-square statistic, only 2 questions (35 and 38) were significant in that the responses of the respondents were extremely different. Question 35 dealt with contractual rights of teachers under an <b>educational</b> <b>voucher</b> program and question 38 focused on teacher's professional autonomy and decision-making role under an <b>educational</b> <b>voucher</b> program. Public school board superintendents, school board presidents, and Illinois Education Association presidents strongly oppose the implementation of an <b>educational</b> <b>voucher</b> program in Illinois. These public education providers uniformly believe that vouchers would not solve many of the problems now faced by schools.

40|$|Abstract [...] Major policy debates {{have arisen}} around {{the subject of}} {{educational}} vouchers as an alternative for financing and organizing the educational system. To a large degree comparisons between vouchers and the traditional system of educational finance and school operations have been limited {{to one or two}} dimensions of education such as the relative impact of a particular system on achievement test scores. This paper describes a comprehensive, evaluative framework that draws upon a larger range of goals that have been posed for education in a democratic and free society. These criteria include: (1) freedom of choice; (2) productive efficiency; (3) equity; and (4) social cohesion. The framework demonstrates the importance of and tradeoffs among these four criteria in evaluating specific <b>educational</b> <b>voucher</b> plans and comparing them to other alternatives such as charter schools as well as the more traditional public school arrangement.

40|$|Milton Friedman {{is famous}} for his book title: “Free to Choose. ” He also favors <b>{{education}}al</b> <b>vouchers,</b> which denies {{the freedom to choose}} to people who do not wish to subsidize the education of other people’s children. Thus, he is guilty of a logical contradiction. Why is it important to assess whether Friedman’s views on <b>educational</b> <b>vouchers</b> are logically consistent with his widespread reputation as an advocate of free enterprise, and, thus, freedom to chose? It is important to assess all figures in political economy, and indeed all of scholarship, for logical consistency. It is particularly important {{to do so in the}} present case, given the prestige in certain quarters accorded to this Nobel prize-winning economist. We argue in this paper that Friedman’s reputation for logical consistency, and adherence to the philosophy of laissez faire capitalism, are both overblown. Our solution to this challenge is to completely privatize education. Friedman does not advocate that vouchers be utilized for food, clothing or shelter; we see no relevant difference in the case of education. What is the justification of the undertaken topic? This topic is important because education of the next generation is crucial for the upkeep and improvement of society. What is the aim of the present study? It is to demonstrate that the solution offered by M. Friedman and R. Friedman (1990) is highly problematic. What is the methodology used in the study?
