At more or less regular stages it was pierced by apertures closed by doors, none of which he could open until he had climbed fully fifty feet from the river level. Here he discovered a door already ajar opening into a large, circular chamber, the walls and floors of which were covered with the skins of wild beasts and with rugs of many colors; but what interested him most was the occupants of the room--a Wieroo, and a girl of human proportions. She was standing with her back against a column which rose {{from the center of}} the apartment from floor to ceiling--a <b>hollow</b> <b>column</b> about forty inches in diameter in which he could see an opening some thirty inches across. The girl's side was toward Bradley, and her face averted, for she was watching the Wieroo, who was now advancing slowly toward her, talking as he came.|$|E
60|$|Falkland {{has most}} {{interesting}} remains. A double entrance-tower, and a side building running east from it, is roofed, {{and in some}} degree habitable; a corresponding building running northward from the eastern corner is totally ruinous, having been destroyed by fire. The architecture is highly ornamented, {{in the style of}} the Palace at Stirling. Niches with statues, with projections, cornices, etc, are lavished throughout. Many cornice medallions exhibited such heads as those procured from the King's room at Stirling, the originals, perhaps, being the same. The repeated cypher of James V. and Mary of Guise attest the builder of this part of the palace. When complete it had been a quadrangle. There is as much of it as remained when Slezer published his drawings. Some part of the interior has been made what is called habitable, that is, a half-dozen of bad rooms have been gotten out of it. Am clear in my own mind a ruin should be protected, but never repaired. The proprietor has a beautiful place called Nut-hill, within ten minutes' walk of Falkland, and commanding some fine views of it and of the Lomond Hill. This should be the residence. But Mr. Bruce and his predecessor, my old professor, John Bruce,[349] deserve great credit for their attention to prevent dilapidation, which was doing its work fast upon the ancient palace. The only remarkable apartment was a large and well-proportioned gallery with a painted roof--tempore Jacobi Sexti--and built after his succession to the throne of England. I noticed a curious thing,--a <b>hollow</b> <b>column</b> concealed the rope which rung the Castle bell, keeping it safe from injury and interruption.|$|E

5000|$|The {{secondary}} {{is usually}} shown as {{a column of}} fusion fuel and other components wrapped in many layers. Around the column is first a [...] "pusher-tamper", a heavy layer of uranium-238 (U-238) or lead that serves to help compress the fusion fuel (and, {{in the case of}} uranium, may eventually undergo fission itself). Inside this is the fusion fuel itself, usually a form of lithium deuteride, which is used because it is easier to weaponize than liquified tritium/deuterium gas. This dry fuel, when bombarded by neutrons, produces tritium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen which can undergo nuclear fusion, along with the deuterium present in the mixture. (See the article on nuclear fusion for a more detailed technical discussion of fusion reactions.) Inside the layer of fuel is the [...] "spark plug", a <b>hollow</b> <b>column</b> of fissile material (plutonium-239 or uranium-235) often boosted by deuterium gas. The spark plug, when compressed, can itself undergo nuclear fission (because of the shape, it is not a critical mass without compression).

50|$|The Baker {{nuclear test}} at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 was a shallow {{underwater}} explosion, part of Operation Crossroads. A 20 kiloton warhead was detonated in a lagoon which was approximately 200 ft deep. The first effect was illumination {{of the water}} because of the underwater fireball. A rapidly expanding gas bubble created a shock wave that caused an expanding ring of apparently dark water at the surface, called the slick, followed by an expanding ring of apparently white water, called the crack. A mound of water and spray, called the spray dome, formed at the water's surface which became more columnar as it rose. When the rising gas bubble broke the surface, it created a shock wave {{in the air as}} well. Water vapor in the air condensed {{as a result of a}} Prandtl-Glauert singularity, making a spherical cloud that marked the location of the shock wave. Water filling the cavity formed by the bubble caused a <b>hollow</b> <b>column</b> of water, called the chimney or plume, to rise 6000 ft in the air and break through the top of the cloud. A series of surface waves moved outwards from the center. The first wave was about 94 ft high at 1000 ft from the center. Other waves followed, and at further distances some of these were higher than the first wave. For example, at 22000 ft from the center, the ninth wave was the highest at 6 ft. Gravity caused the column to fall to the surface and caused a cloud of mist to move outwards rapidly from the base of the column, called the base surge. The ultimate size of the base surge was 3.5 mi in diameter and 1800 ft high. The base surge rose from the surface and merged with other products of the explosion, to form clouds which produced moderate to heavy rainfall for nearly one hour.|$|E
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) hollow piers in bridges withstand high {{moment and}} shear demands ensured with reduced mass and lower stress on foundations compared with solid piers. Failure of <b>hollow</b> <b>columns</b> is typically affected by premature buckling of reinforcing bars and concrete cover spalling. At present, no guidelines {{are available for}} the design of their upgrade, and few research investigations can be found on <b>hollow</b> <b>columns</b> strengthened by using fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) materials. This paper discusses an experimental program carried out on purely compressed RC <b>hollow</b> <b>columns</b> externally wrapped with glass-fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP). Three specimens were tested: one specimen was unstrengthened and used as the benchmark; the other two specimens were GFRP-wrapped with different confining reinforcement ratios. Each specimen was designed according to dated codes (i. e., prior to 1970) accounting only for gravity loads. In particular, steel longitudinal bars cross section and steel tie-spacing were designed with the minimum amount of longitudinal reinforcement and minimum tie area at maximum spacing. Tests results highlight that the GFRP-jacket mainly provided ductility increases before low strength increments could be obtained. Refined and simplified numerical models for <b>hollow</b> square RC <b>columns,</b> previously proposed by the authors, herein extend to hollow rectangular members. Comparisons of experimental results and theoretical predictions on the basis of both refined and simplified confinement models were performed and showed good agreement.

40|$|Most of {{the steel}} {{structures}} in India are made of conventional steel sections (such as angle, channel and beam sections). However, new hollow steel sections (such as square and rectangular hollow sections) are gaining popularity in recent steel constructions due {{to a number of}} advantages such as its higher strength to weight ratio, better fire resistance properties, higher radius of gyration, lesser surface area, etc. This type of hollow sections can save cost up to 30 to 50 % over the conventional steel sections (Tata Steel brochure, 2012). But unlike the conventional steel sections these hollow sections do not have standard connection details available in design code or in published literature. To overcome this problem the objective {{of the present study was}} identified to develop a suitable and economic connection detail between two square hollow sections which should be capable of transmitting forces smoothly and easy to be fabricated. To achieve the above objective, a square hollow beam to square <b>hollow</b> <b>column</b> connection was selected and modelled in commercial finite element software ABAQUS.
