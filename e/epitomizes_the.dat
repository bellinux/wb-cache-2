5|$|The incongruous make-up {{between the}} Western lower half and Thai roof has been {{compared}} with a Farang (Western) lady clothed in Victorian costume while wearing a Thai crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition is the emphasis of the superiority of Thai architecture (as a crown upon the head) over those of the West (the {{lower half of the}} body). This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as it was supposed to convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance over Western imperialism, both of sovereignty and style. From another perspective, the building itself <b>epitomizes</b> <b>the</b> internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization and modernity (led by King Rama V) against those of the traditional ruling elites (as led by some of his early ministers).|$|E

25|$|The Flatiron Building was {{designed}} by Chicago's Daniel Burnham as a vertical Renaissance palazzo with Beaux-Arts styling. Unlike New York's early skyscrapers, which {{took the form of}} towers arising from a lower, blockier mass, such as the contemporary Singer Building (built 1902–08), the Flatiron Building <b>epitomizes</b> <b>the</b> Chicago school conception: like a classical Greek column, its facade – limestone at the bottom changing to glazed terra-cotta from the Atlantic Terra Cotta Company in Tottenville, Staten Island as the floors rise – is divided into a base, shaft and capital.|$|E

500|$|Douglas Winter, {{author of}} Fear Itself: The Horror Fiction of Stephen King, {{believes}} that Flagg <b>epitomizes</b> <b>the</b> Gothic villain—an [...] "atavistic embodiment of evil"—since his appearance is indistinct, malleable and a “collection of masks". Flagg symbolizes [...] "the inexplicable {{fear of the}} return of bygone powers—both technological and, as his last name intimates, sociopolitical". Like other Gothic villains, Flagg’s plans seem to fail at every turn as he seems to need to convince others of his importance. Winter asserts that Flagg is a Miltonic superman who receives his strength from a dark, mysterious source. He compares him to J. R. R. Tolkien’s Sauron in The Lord of the Rings: both collapse when directly confronted.|$|E
500|$|Achebe also {{discussed}} a quotation from Albert Schweitzer, a 1952 Nobel Peace Prize laureate: [...] "That extraordinary missionary, Albert Schweitzer, who sacrificed brilliant careers {{in music and}} theology in Europe {{for a life of}} service to Africans in much the same area as Conrad writes about, <b>epitomizes</b> <b>the</b> ambivalence. In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says: 'The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother.' And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice {{in the days before the}} germ theory of disease came into being." [...] Some were surprised that Achebe would challenge a man honoured in the West for his [...] "reverence for life".|$|E
500|$|The colours {{and symbols}} of the flag carry cultural, political, and {{regional}} meanings. [...] The blue evokes the water, {{as well as its}} significance to the country in the form of rivers, rain, and the Pacific Ocean. [...] The green alludes to the land, along with the trees and crops that grow on it. [...] The yellow <b>epitomizes</b> <b>the</b> sun and its rays separating the land and the ocean. The five stars are arranged in three offset rows at the canton, {{in the shape of the}} letter X. [...] At first, these were meant to symbolize the provinces that the country was subdivided into at the time of independence. [...] Even though new provinces have since been created, the number of stars has remained unchanged.|$|E

500|$|Tron: Legacy is {{imbued with}} several {{references}} to religious themes, particularly those relating to Christianity and Buddhism. Olivia Wilde's character, Quorra, was {{informed by the}} historical Catholic figure Joan of Arc. Wilde sought inspiration from her six months before production of the film commenced. She, alongside Kosinski, collaborated with the writers on editing the characters so she would contain the characteristics of Joan of Arc. Wilde assessed {{the characteristics of the}} figure: [...] "She's this unlikely warrior, very strong but compassionate, and completely led by selflessness. Also, she thinks she's in touch with some higher power and has one foot in another world. All of these were elements of Quorra." [...] Since she <b>epitomizes</b> <b>the</b> concept of androgyny, producers conceived Quorra from an androgynous perspective, notably giving her a short haircut.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, {{art critic}} Camille Paglia praised {{the film in}} Glittering Images, {{comparing}} some of its scenes to works by modern painters and calling it [...] "the greatest work of art in recent memory". Paglia explained that the film's finale, [...] "has more inherent artistic value, emotional power, and global impact than anything by the artists you name. It's because the art world has flat-lined and become an echo chamber of received opinion and toxic over-praise. It's like the emperor's new clothes -- people are too intimidated to admit what they secretly think or what they might think with their blinders off. Episode III <b>epitomizes</b> <b>the</b> modern digital art movement, more so than other piece from the last 30 years. I had considered using Japanese anime for the digital art chapter of the book, but it lacked the overwhelming operatic power and yes, seriousness of Lucas's Revenge of the Sith." ...|$|E
500|$|Lord of Scoundrels was {{released}} in January 1995 by Avon Books, the same publisher that had released Chase's last two novels. According to Chase's website, the novel has been published in over fourteen languages. A Spanish translation {{was released}} in 2006, while a Japanese translation {{was released in}} 2008. Its e-book edition, published by HarperCollins, landed on The New York Times Best Seller list in August 2011. In 1996, the novel earned the RITA Award for [...] "Best Short Historical", a prize given annually by the Romance Writers of America. It also won the 1996 [...] "Regency Historical Romance" [...] award, granted by the Romantic Times. In a review by that publication, M. Helfer praised Chase for being [...] "an exquisite storyteller who creates sharply original characters and moves them in new and exciting ways. One of the true treasures of the genre, she <b>epitomizes</b> <b>the</b> essence of excellence in every word she writes".|$|E

500|$|Dusty Saunders of Rocky Mountain News {{described}} the farewell episode as [...] "Unforgettable", praising several acting performances. Of Simone (Smits), {{he described his}} performance as [...] "spellbinding" [...] noting his [...] "Particularly effective" [...] and metaphorical scenes with his pigeons in addition to saying [...] "Smits {{is not the first}} TV actor to portray a character, lying in bed, facing death. Such scenes are as common as headache relief commercials. However, Smits' compassionate portrayal is as realistic as weekly TV drama gets." [...] He described Russell (Delaney) as [...] "...superb Tuesday night, displaying both helpless agony and feisty determination." [...] Although he praised her role as a wife, he noted that as a detective her dealings with her partner Det. Jill Kurkendall (Andrea Thompson) were cliched. He noted that Greg Medavoy's [...] (Gordon Clapp) [...] "...frustration <b>epitomizes</b> <b>the</b> concern of the precinct crew as it monitors Bobby's Simone's battle for life."

500|$|The {{architecture}} is epitomized {{by a combination}} of Romanesque and Gothic Revival buildings spread across the eastern and central portions of campus, most dating between 1858 and 1929. The traditional heart of the university, known as Front Campus, is near the campus centre in an oval lawn enclosed by King's College Circle. The centrepiece is the main building of University College, built in 1857 with an eclectic blend of Richardsonian Romanesque and Norman architectural elements. The dramatic effect of this blended design by architect Frederick William Cumberland drew praise from European visitors of the time: [...] "Until I reached Toronto," [...] remarked Lord Dufferin during his visit in 1872, [...] "I confess I was not aware that so magnificent a specimen of architecture existed upon the American continent." [...] The building was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1968. Built in 1907, Convocation Hall is recognizable for its domed roof and Ionic-pillared rotunda. Although its foremost function is hosting the annual convocation ceremonies, the building is a venue for academic and social events throughout the year. The sandstone buildings of Knox College <b>epitomizes</b> <b>the</b> North American collegiate Gothic design, with its characteristic cloisters surrounding a secluded courtyard.|$|E
500|$|In The Washington Post, Richard Harrington {{said because}} Feat of a Black Planet is a {{challenging}} listen, [...] "How it's met {{depends on how}} it's understood." [...] Robert Christgau, writing for The Village Voice, felt that its [...] "brutal pace" [...] ultimately loses momentum and that the group's lyrics are still ideologically flawed, but wrote that although their [...] "rebel music" [...] is gimmicky, [...] "this is show business, and they still think harder than anybody else working their beat." [...] Peter Watrous of The New York Times called it [...] "an essential pop album" [...] and stated, [...] "On their own, the lyrics seen functional. Taken with the music, they bloom with meaning." [...] Simon Reynolds of Melody Maker remarked that the content <b>epitomizes</b> <b>the</b> group's significance at the time: [...] "Public Enemy are important ... because of the angry questions that seethe in their music, in {{the very fabric of}} their sound; the bewilderment and rage that, in this case, have made for one hell of strong, scary album". Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot felt that with the album, [...] "Public Enemy affirms that {{it is not just a}} great rap group, but one of the best rock bands on the planet-black or otherwise".|$|E

500|$|Probably {{more than}} any other rider in the Pony Express, William Cody (better known as Buffalo Bill) <b>epitomizes</b> <b>the</b> legend and the folklore, be it fact or fiction, of the Pony Express. Numerous stories have been told of young Cody's adventures as a Pony Express rider. At the age of 15 Cody was on his way west to California when he met Pony Express agents along the way and signed on with the company. Cody helped in the {{construction}} of several way-stations. Thereafter, he was employed as a rider and was given a short [...] delivery run from the township of Julesburg which lay to the west. After some months he was transferred to Slade's Division in Wyoming where he made the longest non-stop ride from Red Buttes Station to Rocky Ridge Station and back when he found that his relief rider had been killed. The distance of [...] over {{one of the most dangerous}} sections of the entire trail was completed in 21 hours and 40 minutes, and 21 horses were required to complete this section. [...] On one occasion when carrying mail he unintentionally ran into an Indian war party but managed to escape. Cody was present for many significant chapters in early western history, including the gold rush, the building of the railroads and cattle herding on the Great Plains. A career as a scout for the Army under General Phillip Sheridan following the Civil War earned him his nickname and established his notoriety as a frontiersman.|$|E
500|$|Author T. C. McNult has {{referred}} to the Stork Club during its existence as [...] "the most celebrated nightspot in the world"; while author Ed McMahon has called it the [...] "most realistic nightclub of all", a name [...] "synonymous with fame, class, and money, in no particular order". [...] Society writer Lucius Beebe wrote in 1946: [...] "To {{millions and millions of}} people all of over the world the Stork symbolizes and <b>epitomizes</b> <b>the</b> de luxe upholstery of quintessentially urban existence. It means fame; it means wealth; it means an elegant way of life among celebrated folk". The club was a prime example of the flourishing cafe society at the time, but the real purpose of the Stork Club, according to journalist Ed Sullivan, was people watching other people, particularly non-celebrities watching celebrities. Author Mearl L. Allen, however, highlights that the club was more than a celebrity playground, and that [...] "many decisions of tremendous social and economic importance regarding world affairs were made in the Stork Club during this time", and the likes of Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball could often be seen conversing with executive types. Mark Bernardo, author of Mad Men's Manhattan: The Insider's Guide, has said: [...] "In some ways, the Stork Club was ahead of its time—courting celebrities by picking up their tabs, hiring a house photographer who sent candid shots of guests to the tabloids, and offering a private enclave called the Cub Room, where stars could huddle away from the prying eyes of fans, all hallmarks of modern clubs that cater to boldface names". The venue was usually packed with luminaries during its golden years, and dining orders could {{take a long time to}} be dealt with.|$|E
500|$|... "AFRICOBRA II" [...] {{was held}} in 1971 at the Studio Museum in Harlem before it {{traveled}} to five other museums and galleries. Jarrell exhibited Revolutionary and Black Prince (both 1971) at the show. These two portraits are described by art historian Robert Douglas as displaying [...] "Jarrell's masterful understanding of portraiture, rendered through a chiaroscuro technique employing a multitude of meticulously painted B's in different sizes and coolade hues." [...] Revolutionary is a homage to Angela Davis. She wears a Revolutionary Suit that was designed by Jae Jarrell for the AFRICOBRA II exhibition. Prints were made of the work. However, in the original, the cartridge belt {{is attached to the}} canvas, an idea of Jae's. The words [...] "love", [...] "black", [...] "nation", [...] "time", [...] "rest", [...] "full of shit", [...] "revolution", and [...] "beautiful" [...] burst out of her head on the canvas. The message [...] "I have given my life in the struggle. If I have to lose my life, that is the way it will be," [...] travels down her chest and left arm. [...] "B", as usual, represents [...] "blackness" [...] "bad" [...] and in this painting [...] "beautiful". The work <b>epitomizes</b> <b>the</b> goal by AFRICOBRA artists to use all space possible in their creations, described as [...] "jam-packed and jelly tight." [...] Revolutionary was reviewed by Nancy Tobin Willig as [...] "a portrait of a young black woman screaming slogans – with a bandoleer loaded with real bullets slung over her shoulder. Jarrell's painting is an overstatement. It is not art as the weapon. It is the weapon as art." [...] Black Prince is Jarrell's second tribute to Malcolm X. [...] "B" [...] appears in the painting, as well as [...] "P"; [...] "PRINCE" [...] and [...] "BLACK" [...] which travel throughout Malcolm's face and hand. The quote [...] "I believe in anything necessary to correct unjust conditions, political, economic, social, physical. Anything necessary as long as it gets results," [...] is painted across his chest and arm. Their second show, [...] "AFRICOBRA III", opened in 1973. Critics were more aware of the aesthetic and movement at this show; critic Paul Richard commented that the works of Nelson Stevens, Jeff Donaldson and Jarrell [...] "together contradict something I have long believed: that art that is so blatantly political is not art at all." ...|$|E
