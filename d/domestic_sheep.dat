5|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> are {{relatively}} small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral. <b>Domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic {{as a result of}} selective breeding by humans. A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> may have no horns at all (i.e. polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.|$|E
5|$|The exact line {{of descent}} between <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> and their wild {{ancestors}} is unclear. The most common hypothesis states that Ovis aries is descended from the Asiatic (O. orientalis) species of mouflon. It has been proposed that the European mouflon (O. musimon) is an ancient breed of <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> turned feral rather than an ancestor, despite its commonly being cited as ancestor in past literature. A few breeds of sheep, such as the Castlemilk Moorit from Scotland, were formed through crossbreeding with wild European mouflon.|$|E
5|$|The urial (O. vignei) {{was once}} {{thought to have been}} a forebear of <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep,</b> as they {{occasionally}} interbreed with mouflon in the Iranian part of their range. However, the urial, argali (O. ammon), and snow sheep (O. nivicola) have a different number of chromosomes than other Ovis species, making a direct relationship implausible, and phylogenetic studies show no evidence of urial ancestry. Further studies comparing European and Asian breeds of sheep showed significant genetic differences between the two. Two explanations for this phenomenon have been posited. The first explanation is that a currently unknown species or subspecies of wild sheep that contributed to the formation of <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep.</b> The second explanation is that this variation is the result of multiple waves of capture from wild mouflon, similar to the known development of other livestock.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} mammals, <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> {{reproduction}} occurs sexually. Their reproductive strategy {{is very similar}} to other domestic herd animals. A flock of sheep is generally mated by a single ram, which has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams (in feral populations). Most sheep have a breeding season (tupping) in the autumn, though some are able to breed year-round.|$|E
5|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> are {{sometimes}} used in medical research, particularly for researching cardiovascular physiology, {{in areas such}} as hypertension and heart failure. Pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human pregnancy, and have been used to investigate the effects on fetal development of malnutrition and hypoxia. In behavioral sciences, sheep have been used in isolated cases for the study of facial recognition, as their mental process of recognition is qualitatively similar to humans.|$|E
5|$|The Jacob is a {{traditional}} British breed of <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep.</b> It combines two characteristics unusual in sheep: it is piebald – dark-coloured with areas of white wool – and it is often polycerate or multi-horned. It most commonly has four horns. The origin of the breed is not known; broken-coloured polycerate sheep were present in England {{by the middle of}} the seventeenth century, and were widespread a century later. A breed society was formed in 1969, and a flock book was published from 1972.|$|E

3000|$|... dIn this article, we are {{primarily}} concerned with conservation and wildlife policies insofar {{as they relate to}} wildlife interactions with livestock in dryland environments. We are also concerned with the effects of livestock on wildlife, and not the effects of wildlife on livestock. Wildlife is defined as wild grazing ungulates and livestock as <b>domestic</b> cattle, <b>sheep,</b> goats, and camels.|$|R
5|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> {{provide a}} wide array of raw materials. Wool {{was one of the first}} textiles, {{although}} in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics. For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies. Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation. In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity {{is one of}} the dilemmas of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E

25|$|The leather loincloth {{and hide}} coat {{were made from}} sheepskin. Genetic {{analysis}} showed that the sheep species was nearer to modern <b>domestic</b> European <b>sheep</b> than to wild sheep; the items were made from the skins of at least four animals. Part of the coat was made from domesticated goat belonging to a mitochondrial haplogroup (a common female ancestor) that inhabits central Europe today.|$|R
40|$|A partial DNA {{sequence}} of cytochrome b gene {{was used to}} identify the remains of endangered animals and species endemic to Taiwan. The conservation of animals species {{included in this study}} were: the formosan gem-faced civets, leopard cats, tigers, clouded leopards, lion, formosan muntjacs, formosan sika deers, formosan sambars, formosan serows, water buffalo, formosan pangolins and formosan macaques. The control species used included domestic cats, <b>domestic</b> dogs, <b>domestic</b> <b>sheeps,</b> <b>domestic</b> cattles, domestic pigs and humans. Heteroplasmy was detected in the formosan macaque, domestic pig and domestic cats. The frequencies of heteroplasmy in these animals were about 0. 25 % (1 in 402 bp). Sequences were aligned by Pileup program of GCG computer package, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method. The results of sequence comparison showed that the percentage range of sequence diversity in the same species was from 0. 25 to 2. 74 %, and that between the different species was from 5. 97 to 34. 83 %. The results of phylogenetic analysis showed that the genetic distance between the different species was from 6. 33 to 40. 59. Animals of the same species, both the endangered animal species and domestic animals, were clustered together in the neighbor-joining tree. Three unknown samples of animal remains were identified by this system. The partial {{sequence of}} cytochrome b gene adopted in this study proved to be usable for animal identification...|$|R
25|$|The now-extinct Ancon sheep {{was created}} by humans through the {{selective}} breeding of common <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> with achondroplasia. The average-sized torso combined with the relatively smaller legs produced by achondroplasia was valued for making affected sheep less likely to escape without affecting the amount of wool or meat each sheep produced.|$|E
25|$|Agricultural {{production}} is limited—only 2% {{of the land}} is arable—and most food has to be imported. Some tobacco is grown locally. The principal livestock activity is <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra's natural resources include hydroelectric power, mineral water, timber, iron ore, and lead.|$|E
25|$|For {{thousands}} of years, the aboriginal San (Bushman) populations in Southern Africa hunted {{without the help}} of dogs. Although the Khoikhoi brought <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> along a western migratory route to the Cape of Good Hope just before the Christian era, there is no conclusive evidence that dogs were part of their party.|$|E
50|$|The fauna remainings {{show how}} {{important}} were the <b>domestic</b> species: <b>sheep</b> and goats, followed by oxen, pigs and dogs. During the Bronze Age, the {{activities related to}} cattle raising, were {{even more important than}} in the previous periods. The products associated with these activities, such as the milk, cheese, wool, etc., will continue to gain relevance. There were also deer bones in the site, showing the importance of hunting activities for these communities.|$|R
50|$|The large {{quantity}} of bones {{discovered in the}} settlements, most originating from <b>domestic</b> animals, cattle, <b>sheep,</b> swine—as well as game—indicate the importance of domestic animals to supplement hunting, {{as well as the}} importance of meat in the daily diet.|$|R

25|$|Only a few {{species of}} wild land mammals {{are found in}} the Faroe Islands today, all {{introduced}} by humans. Three species are thriving on the islands today: mountain hare (Lepus timidus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the house mouse (Mus musculus). Apart from these, there once was a local <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> breed, the Faroe sheep (depicted on the coat of arms), a variety of feral sheep survived on Lítla Dímun until the mid-19th century.|$|E
25|$|Many {{bighorn sheep}} {{populations in the}} United States {{experience}} regular outbreaks of infectious pneumonia, which likely result from the introduction of bacterial pathogens (in particular, Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, and some strains of Mannheimia haemolytica) carried asymptomatically in <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep.</b> Once introduced, pathogens can transmit rapidly through a bighorn population, resulting in all-age die-offs that sometimes kill up to 90% of the population. In the years following pathogen introduction, bighorn populations frequently experience multiple years of lamb pneumonia outbreaks. These outbreaks can severely limit recruitment and likely play a powerful role in slowing population growth.|$|E
25|$|Plum and almond {{orchards}} exist but {{are less}} extensive {{than in the}} past. Wine production from local grapes is minimal ever since the phylloxera blight of the 1940s destroyed the vineyards. Though there is local small scale wine production using local grapes, most wine produced on the island is for home use and much is pressed from grapes imported from Thessaly. Herding of domestic goats and <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> continues and a local feta type cheese is produced from these stocks. Beekeeping and honey production have increased in recent years. Skopelos supports a small fishing fleet which fishes local waters.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} rituals were indistinguishable from {{practice}} at other Greek sanctuaries. Prayer and supplications accompanied by blood sacrifices of <b>domestic</b> animals (<b>sheep</b> and pigs) burnt in sacred hearths (/escháre), {{as well as}} libations made to the chthonic deities in circular or rectangular ritual pits (/vóthros). A large number of rock altars were used, the largest of which {{was surrounded by a}} monumental enclosure {{at the end of the}} 4th century BCE (site plan, number 11).|$|R
5000|$|In the 1890s, an {{epizootic}} of the {{rinderpest virus}} struck Africa, {{considered to be}} [...] "the most devastating epidemic to hit southern Africa {{in the late nineteenth}} century". It killed more than 5.2 million cattle south of the Zambezi, as well as <b>domestic</b> oxen, <b>sheep,</b> and goats, and wild populations of buffalo, giraffe, and wildebeest. This led to starvation resulting in the death of an estimated third of the human population of Ethiopia and two-thirds of the Maasai people of Tanzania.|$|R

25|$|No {{data have}} been {{compiled}} showing the susceptibility {{of the sheep}} to disease, although tests have been run on similar species of sheep and the data may be similar. Since Marco Polo sheep are reluctant to approach people, {{it is not likely}} that they can catch diseases common to domestic flocks, although some <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> are allowed to run wild over the mountains, and it is unknown if they come into contact with Marco Polo sheep. However, the shepherds in the area do not generally have access to veterinary care for their animals, and it is possible that these could transmit diseases to the wild sheep.|$|E
25|$|Lucilia sericata {{is common}} {{all over the}} {{temperate}} and tropical regions of the planet, mainly the Southern Hemisphere: Africa and Australia. It prefers warm and moist climates and accordingly is especially common in coastal regions, {{but it also is}} present in arid areas. The female lays her eggs in meat, fish, animal corpses, infected wounds of humans or animals, and excrement. The larvae feed on decomposing tissue. The insect favours species of the genus Ovis, <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep</b> in particular. This can lead to blow fly strike, causing problems for sheep farmers, though L. sericata is not a major cause of blow fly strike in most regions.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{predation}} {{of domestic}} livestock occurs, which brings it into direct conflict with humans. However, even in Mongolia, where wild prey {{have been reduced}} and interactions with humans are common, domestic livestock (mainly <b>domestic</b> <b>sheep)</b> comprises less than 20% of the diet of species, with wild prey being taken whenever possible. Herders will kill snow leopards {{to prevent them from}} taking their animals. The loss of prey animals due to overgrazing by domestic livestock, poaching, and defense of livestock are the major drivers for the decreasing population of the snow leopard. The snow leopard has not been reported to attack humans, and appears to be the least aggressive to humans of all big cats. As a result, they are easily driven away from livestock; they readily abandon their kills when threatened, and may not even defend themselves when attacked.|$|E
