25|$|Much of what I {{did with}} my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> myself to keep my ribs open. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E
25|$|In the following, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> {{ourselves}} {{that every one}} of Turing’s “computing machines” is a binary-number generator/creator that begins work on “blank tape”. Properly constructed, it always cranks away ad infinitum, but its instructions are always finite. In Turing’s proofs, Turing’s tape had a “left end” but extended right ad infinitum. For sake of example below we will assume that the “machine” is not a Universal machine, but rather the simpler “dedicated machine” with the instructions in the Table.|$|E
25|$|Before {{releasing}} the jury for deliberation, Judge Learned Hand altered {{the charges against}} the defendants and attempted to preface the jury of their constitutional duties. Hand dismissed all the charges against Josephine Bell, and dismissed the first count – “conspiracy to cause mutiny and refusal of duty”—against the remaining defendants. Prior to {{releasing the}} jurors, Judge Hand stated, “I do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> you that every man {{has the right to}} have such economic, philosophic or religious opinions as seem to him best, whether they be socialist, anarchistic or atheistic.” After deliberating from Thursday afternoon to Saturday, the jury returned with two decisions. First, the jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the jurors seeking to convict the defendants blamed one juror for being unable to conform to the majority opinion, as he was also a socialist and, consequently, un-American. Not only did the other eleven jurors demand the prosecutor to levy charges against the lone juror) but moved to drag the socialist supporter out into the street and lynch him. Judge Hand, given the uproar, declared a mistrial.|$|E

500|$|In August 2013, Gunn {{revealed}} that Tyler Bates would be composing the film's score. Gunn stated that Bates would write {{some of the}} score first {{so that he can}} film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film. In February 2014, Gunn {{revealed that}} the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as [...] "Hooked on a Feeling", on a mixtape in Quill's Walkman, which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost. In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the 60s and 70s were [...] "cultural reference points", saying, [...] "It’s striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> us that, yeah, [...] is a real person from planet Earth who’s just like you and me. Except that he’s in this big outer space adventure." ...|$|E
2500|$|What {{is going}} on? First, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> {{ourselves}} that we have assigned a parameter (a natural number) to every variable xi. Second, we do see a successor-operator at work iterating y (i.e. the y'). And third, {{we see that the}} function μy yχ(y, x) is just producing instances of χ(y,x) i.e. χ(0,x), χ(1,x), ... until an instance yields 0. Fourth, when an instance χ(n,x) yields 0 it causes the middle term of τ, i.e. v = π( [...] x, y' [...] ) to yield 0. Finally, when the middle term v = 0, μy yχ(y) executes line (iii) and [...] "exits". Kleene's presentation of equations (ii) and (iii) have been exchanged to make this point that line (iii) represents [...] an exit—an exit taken only when the search successfully finds a y to satisfy χ(y) and the middle product-term π(x, y' [...] ) is 0; the operator then terminates its search with τ(z', 0, y) = y.|$|E
2500|$|Although his terse one-liners {{are well}} known, {{he is also}} known for having a dark sense of humour. On the 20th lap of the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Räikkönen had just taken the lead from Lewis Hamilton and his race {{engineer}} Simon Rennie advised that Fernando Alonso was five seconds behind {{and that he would}} be kept informed of Alonso's pace; Räikkönen replied, [...] "Just leave me alone, I know what I'm doing!" [...] Later in the same race, he admonished his team again, when being told to manage the tyre temperature: [...] "Yes, yes, yes, yes, I'm doing that all the time. You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> me every ten seconds!" [...] The first quote attracted significant press coverage, and Räikkönen made no attempt to apologise in the post-race interview. It was earlier reported that he printed 500 T-shirts with the quote for the entire Lotus team, but this was later invalidated by Räikkönen in an interview with an FOM media personnel. The quote is also featured on his official website.|$|E

60|$|St. Clare rose up {{and walked}} thoughtfully {{up and down the}} verandah, seeming to forget {{everything}} in his own thoughts; so absorbed was he, that Tom <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> him twice that the teabell had rung, before he could get his attention.|$|R
60|$|I, too, was moved, for {{it seemed}} as though the time were come at last when {{something}} of my mother's history would be made known to me. But he seemed in no hurry to speak again. It was I who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> him of my presence.|$|R
