The introductory chapters deal with the legal basis for social security and medical reviews at international and national levels, as well as the historical development of health assessments, which has an impact on the shape of existing legislation. The division of the entire social security system into its three basic subsystems is described in a chapter laced with discussions about individual benefits, which this thesis takes up.
