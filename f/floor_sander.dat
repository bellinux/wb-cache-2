500|$|On Wednesday, February 27, {{the parents}} made an appeal on {{television}} {{to anyone who}} may have kidnapped Barker, asking them to [...] "leave {{the child in the}} nearest church." [...] Vern Lovering, a 43-year old <b>floor</b> <b>sander</b> and convicted child molester had been questioned, and said he was near the Barker home. On Thursday, February 28, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted its own search, and the next day again questioned Lovering after police received a phone call demanding $500 ransom. Police made an appeal to the kidnapper not to [...] "act in haste or do harm to the child." ...|$|E
50|$|Located in {{the western}} edge of Mercury's giant Caloris basin, Kertész crater (named in 2008 for André Kertész, a Hungarian-born American photographer) has some unusual, bright {{material}} located on its <b>floor.</b> <b>Sander</b> crater, located in the northwestern edge of Caloris basin, also shows bright material on its floor. Just northeast of Kertész a small crater has very bright rays and ejecta, indicating that the crater is young.|$|E
50|$|Some {{accessories}} {{may actually}} be consumables, for example a tool rental company might include dust masks and sanding belts with the rental of a <b>Floor</b> <b>Sander.</b> In this case, the consumables may be billed upfront as a normal retail product, or may be supplied on a sale or return basis where the rental company will charge based on the unused product returned {{at the end of}} the rental period.|$|E
50|$|Random orbit sanders are {{hand-held}} {{power tools}} for sanding {{in which the}} sanding blade delivers a random-orbit action. That is, the angle of rotation {{of the head and}} disk is variable. Perhaps the first introduced in 1976 by Festool but in 1982, random orbit sanders combine the speed and aggressiveness (again by Festool, Festo in 1982) of a belt sander with the ability to produce a finer finish than that available from a standard, slow speed orbital finishing sander. Random orbital sanders generally come in three different types: electric powered, air powered, and orbital <b>floor</b> <b>sanders.</b> The electric and air powered orbital sanders are handheld, while the <b>floor</b> orbital <b>sanders</b> are large machines that roll.|$|R
5000|$|Sanders {{believes}} {{global warming}} is a serious problem. Along with Senator Barbara Boxer, Sanders introduced the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act of 2007 on January 15, 2007. In a July 26, 2012 speech on the Senate <b>floor,</b> <b>Sanders</b> addressed claims made by Senator Jim Inhofe: [...] "The bottom line is when Senator Inhofe says {{global warming is}} a hoax, he is just dead wrong, according to {{the vast majority of}} climate scientists." [...] He was Climate Hawks Vote's top-rated senator on climate leadership in the 113th Congress.|$|R
50|$|All modern sanding {{projects}} are completed with specialized sanding machines. The majority of material is removed by large 220 volt belt or drum sander. Belt sanders are preferred for the continuous sand paper belt design to prevent sanding machine marks in <b>floors.</b> The belt <b>sander</b> {{was invented by}} Eugen Laegler in 1969 out of Güglingen, Germany. 90% of the area can be reached with the belt/drum sander. The remaining 10% left such as edges, corners, under cabinets, and stairs, are sanded by an edge sanding machine. A finishing machine known as a multi disc sander or buffer is then used for the final sanding steps.|$|R

5000|$|Joseph Malta (November 27, 1918 [...] - [...] January 6, 1999) was the United States Army hangman who, with Master Sergeant John C. Woods, {{carried out}} the Nuremberg executions of ten former top leaders of the Third Reich on October 16, 1946 after they were sentenced to death during the Nuremberg Trials. Malta was a 28-year-old {{military}} policeman when he volunteered for the job. He ultimately hanged a total of 60 Nazi government and military leaders. A <b>floor</b> <b>sander</b> in civilian life, Malta left the Army in 1947 {{and returned to his}} former job. [...] "It was a pleasure doing it," [...] noted Malta in 1996, echoing the sentiments of his colleague Woods. Malta was born in Revere, Massachusetts.|$|E
2500|$|Sanders {{remained}} the company's symbol after selling it, traveling 200,000 {{miles a year}} on the company's behalf and filming many TV commercials and appearances. He retained much influence over executives and franchisees, who respected his culinary expertise and feared what The New Yorker described as [...] "the force and variety of his swearing" [...] when a restaurant or the company varied from what executives described as [...] "the Colonel's chicken". One change the company made was to the gravy, which Sanders had bragged was so good that [...] "it'll make you throw away the durn chicken and just eat the gravy" [...] but which the company simplified to reduce time and cost. As late as 1979 Sanders made surprise visits to KFC restaurants, and if the food disappointed him, he denounced it to the franchisee as [...] "God-damned slop" [...] or pushed it onto the <b>floor.</b> In 1973, <b>Sanders</b> sued Heublein Inc.—the then parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken—over the alleged misuse of his image in promoting products he had not helped develop. In 1975, Heublein Inc. unsuccessfully sued Sanders for libel after he publicly described their gravy as being [...] "sludge" [...] with a [...] "wall-paper taste".|$|R
