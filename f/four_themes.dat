5|$|Historian George Ostrogorsky {{believed}} that volunteers were gathered through {{the reorganization of}} Anatolia into <b>four</b> <b>themes,</b> where the volunteers were given inalienable grants of land {{on the condition of}} hereditary military service. However, modern scholars generally discredit this theory, placing the creation of the themes later, under Heraclius' successor Constans II.|$|E

25|$|The {{administrative}} regions {{created from}} this system {{were to be}} governed by a strategos, a military governor. The aim of these Themes was to maximize military potential— many able-bodied men and their families were settled in these <b>four</b> <b>themes</b> and given land for farming. In return for land, these men were to provide the Empire with loyal soldiers, and so began the Thematic armies of the Byzantine Empire that {{would prove to be}} reliable, though not unbeatable fighting force for centuries to come. Nonetheless, a native, well-trained army loyal to the state would serve the Empire far more than ill-disciplined mercenaries, whose loyalty to coin could be manipulated and turned against the state itself, as had been exemplified during the Fall of the Western Roman Empire.|$|E

500|$|To {{illustrate}} the four-way split personality of Jimmy, Townshend wrote <b>four</b> <b>themes,</b> reflecting the {{four members of}} the Who. These were [...] "Bell Boy" [...] (Moon), [...] "Is It Me?" [...] (Entwistle), [...] "Helpless Dancer" [...] (Daltrey) and [...] "Love Reign O'er Me" [...] (Townshend).

500|$|K. Nicole Hladky (2013) {{identifies}} <b>four</b> <b>themes</b> in the series: process (the various {{dimensions of}} transition); intersection (of transgender with race, class, age, nationality, etc.); stigma (borne by transgender people); and prescription, {{in which the}} documentary perspective of TransGeneration prefers or endorses [...] "particular views of transgenderism and approaches to transition". Hladky concludes that [...] "though the series does present {{a number of the}} complexities surrounding transgenderism, it nonetheless limits transgender individuals by the prescriptive view of transition it reinforces".|$|E
500|$|The volume {{contains}} {{a number of}} arguments. However, <b>four</b> <b>themes</b> have {{a central role in}} the overall work. The first theme given treatment in the analysis is that the lust for power is a part of human nature. Second, the work emphasises that there are different forms of social power, and that these forms are substantially interrelated. Third, Power insists that [...] "organisations are usually connected with certain kinds of individuals". Finally, the work ends by arguing that [...] "arbitrary rulership can and should be subdued".|$|E

500|$|By 1973, the Who {{turned to}} {{recording}} the album Quadrophenia about mod and its subculture, set against clashes with Rockers in early 1960s Britain. The {{story is about}} a boy named Jimmy, who undergoes a personality crisis, and {{his relationship with his}} family, friends and mod culture. The music features <b>four</b> <b>themes,</b> reflecting the four personalities of the Who. [...] Townshend played multi-tracked synthesizers, and Entwistle played several overdubbed horn parts. By the time the album was being recorded, relationships between the band and Lambert and Stamp had broken down irreparably, and Bill Curbishley replaced them. The album reached No.2 in both the UK and US.|$|E
500|$|Between 8 and 27 August 1963, the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held {{hearings}} on the treaty. The Kennedy administration largely presented a united front {{in favor of the}} deal. Leaders of the once-opposed Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and AEC acknowledged that the treaty would be of net benefit, though Teller, former members of the JCS and AEC, and the commander of the Strategic Air Command made clear their firm opposition. The opponents' argument centered on <b>four</b> <b>themes.</b> First, banning atmospheric tests would prevent the US from ensuring the hardness of its LGM-30 Minuteman missile silos and, second, from developing a capable missile defense system. Third, it was argued that the Soviet Union led the US in high-yield weapons (recall the Soviet Tsar Bomba test of 1961), which required atmospheric testing banned by the treaty, while the US led the Soviet Union in low-yield weapons, which were tested underground and would be permitted by the treaty. Fourth, the ban would prevent peaceful, civilian uses of nuclear detonations. Teller declared that the treaty would be a [...] "step away from safety and possibly... toward war." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{original}} {{score was}} primarily composed, arranged, and produced by Shoji Meguro. The soundtrack features songs with vocals by Shihoko Hirata, whom Meguro felt {{was able to}} meet the range of emotion needed for the soundtrack, with the lyrics being written by Reiko Tanaka. Meguro was given a rough outline of the game's plot and worked on the music in the same manner and simultaneously with the development of the story and spoken dialog, starting with the overall shape of the songs and eventually working on the finer details. According to Meguro, the songs [...] "Pursuing My True Self" [...] and [...] "Reach Out to the Truth" [...] were composed to reflect the inner conflicts of the game's main characters; the former song, used as the opening theme, helped to set an understanding of the characters' conflicts, while the latter, used in battle sequences, emphasized the [...] "strength of these characters to work through their internal struggles." [...] The [...] "Aria of the Soul" [...] theme used in the Velvet Room, a concept common to all the Persona games, remained relatively unchanged, with Meguro believing [...] "the shape of the song had been well-defined" [...] from previous games. Composers Atsushi Kitajoh and Ryota Koduka also contributed music for the game. Kitajoh, who had previously written music for Atlus with Growlanser VI and , contributed <b>four</b> <b>themes</b> to Persona 4, while Koduka wrote the [...] "Theme of Junes".|$|E

2500|$|The {{army of the}} Empire that Heraclius {{worked so}} hard to improve {{eventually}} was reorganized in Asia Minor into <b>four</b> <b>Themes,</b> in what is now known as the Theme system. This system was originally credited by Byzantine historians like George Ostrogorsky to Heraclius. He provides Theophanes as a source, quoting the expression [...] "the district of the themes" [...] in the year 622, showing the themes had begun to be created at this time. However, there is evidence presented by some modern historians that it could possibly be credited to Constans, and yet others leave the door open that Heraclius could possibly have done so in the late 630s in Cilicia. In any case, the debate over exactly when the thematic system originated continues on.|$|E

2500|$|The Opsician {{theme was}} one of the first <b>four</b> <b>themes,</b> and has its origin in the praesental armies of the East Roman army. The term Opsikion derives from the Latin term Obsequium ("retinue"), which by the early 7th century came to refer to the units escorting the emperor on campaign. It is {{possible}} that at an early stage, the Opsikion was garrisoned inside Constantinople itself. In the 640s, however, following the disastrous defeats suffered during the first wave of the Muslim conquests, the remains of the field armies were withdrawn to Asia Minor and settled into large districts, called [...] "themes" [...] (themata). Thus the Opsician theme was the area where the imperial Opsikion was settled, which encompassed all of north-western Asia Minor (Mysia, Bithynia, parts of Galatia, Lydia and Paphlagonia) from the Dardanelles to the Halys River, with Ancyra as its capital. The exact date of the theme's establishment is unknown; the earliest reference points to a creation as early as 626, but the first confirmed occurrence is in 680. It is possible that it also initially included the area of Thrace, which seems to have been administered jointly with the Opsikion in the late 7th and early 8th centuries.|$|E
