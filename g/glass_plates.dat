5|$|Many {{caves in}} the Mendip area were {{excavated}} for archaeological and natural history studies by pioneer explorer Herbert E. Balch and were expertly photographed by caver Harry Savory {{early in the}} 20th century using huge cameras, <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> and flash powder.|$|E
5|$|NIF's laser uses {{a system}} of large flashtubes (like those in a {{photography}} flashlamp) to optically pump {{a large number of}} <b>glass</b> <b>plates.</b> Once the plates are flashed and have settled into a population inversion, a small signal from a separate laser is fed into the optical lines, stimulating the emission in the plates. The plates then dump their stored energy into the growing beam, amplifying it billions of times.|$|E
5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E
5000|$|If k is the {{constant}} phase shift incurred by {{passing through a}} <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> on which a mirror resides, a total of 2k phase shift occurs when reflecting off the rear of a mirror. This is because light traveling toward the rear of a mirror will enter the <b>glass</b> <b>plate,</b> incurring k phase shift, and then reflect off the mirror with no additional phase shift since only air is now behind the mirror, and travel again back through the <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> incurring an additional k phase shift.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 105,000 {{surviving}} <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negatives {{from the}} Tyree Studio were {{donated to the}} Nelson Provincial Museum who holds them as part their large photographic collection.

5000|$|The <b>Glass</b> <b>Plate</b> Negative Project was {{launched}} on 24 November 2010 to relocate over 150,000 <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negatives from mobile shelving into industry standard storage. Before being packed away into their new storage the negatives are digitally photographed {{for use in}} the Museum's online collection database. Funding for this project was secured from the New Zealand Lottery Grant Board, private benefactors and Tasman Bays Heritage Trust. Over 100,000 <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negatives have now been digitised and relocated through this project. You can view these images at the Museum's online collection.|$|R
5|$|A {{week after}} Vancouver's Game 7 loss, Henrik {{was on hand}} at the NHL Awards Ceremony in Las Vegas, having been {{nominated}} along with Daniel for the NHL Foundation Player Award for their charitable work. They lost the award to Los Angeles Kings captain Dustin Brown. For his regular season efforts, Henrik {{was named to the}} NHL First All-Star Team for a second consecutive year, alongside Daniel, who earned the distinction for the first time. Returning to Sweden in the off-season, Henrik and Daniel were co-recipients of the Victoria Scholarship as the country's athletes of the year. They became the third and fourth ice hockey players to receive the award, after Stefan Persson in 1980 and Peter Forsberg in 1994. Henrik and Daniel were presented the award, commemorated with <b>glass</b> <b>plates,</b> on 14 July 2011, in the city of Borgholm.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} the Canucks' loss, Daniel was in {{attendance}} for the NHL Awards show in Las Vegas, having been nominated for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player, the Ted Lindsay Award as the NHL's most outstanding player and the NHL Foundation Player Award for his and Henrik's work in the Vancouver community. Daniel won the Lindsay Award over forwards Martin St. Louis of the Tampa Bay Lightning and Corey Perry of the Anaheim Ducks. In Hart Trophy voting, he finished as the first runner-up to Perry with 51 first-place ballots and 960 voting points total (16 and 83 fewer than Perry, respectively). Daniel and Henrik also lost the NHL Foundation Award to Los Angeles Kings captain Dustin Brown. After being named to the NHL's Second All-Star Team the previous year, Daniel received First Team honours with Henrik for the 2010–11 season. Returning to Sweden in the off-season, Daniel and Henrik were co-recipients of the Victoria Scholarship, as the country's athletes of the year. They became {{the third and fourth}} ice hockey players to receive the award, after Stefan Persson in 1980 and Peter Forsberg in 1994.

That same year, Man Ray, Katherine Dreier, and Duchamp founded the Société Anonyme, an itinerant collection that was the first museum of modern art in the U.S.|$|E
40|$|Retouching <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negatives was a {{practice}} that emerged {{about the same time}} as the <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negative itself. How was photography being retouched in the early 20 th century? Today there are generally available known digital tools. A hundred years ago, the retouching was done by hand, by the photographer, or by specific professionals that don’t distance themselves, in technical demand, of the arts of drawing and painting. But the retouching was invisible in the final object, because the changes were done on the negative. Its contemporary books, in the form of manuals, are a window to the past telling us about the techniques and materials used. Existing archive collections of photographic <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negatives are testimony to the expertise of photographers and the practical use of those books. The present work will show examples of tools and materials used for retouching of photographic <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negatives, taking as an example a portrait collection at the Photographic Archive of Lisbon. Also some considerations are done about the conservation of retouched <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> negatives in archive collections. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

25|$|Babcock and Bergman (1964) placed {{rotating}} <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> {{between the}} mirrors {{of a common}} path interferometer {{set up in a}} static Sagnac configuration. If the <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> behave as new sources of light so that the total speed of light emerging from their surfaces is c+v, a shift in the interference pattern would be expected. However, there was no such effect which again confirms special relativity, and which again demonstrates the source independence of light speed. This experiment was executed in vacuum, thus extinction effects should play no role.|$|E

25|$|Photographic plates, {{which had}} the {{light-sensitive}} emulsion coated on a thin sheet of glass, were normally used instead of flexible film, both because a general transition from <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> to plastic film was still in progress and because glass provided the best dimensional stability for three images intended to match up perfectly when they were later combined.|$|E
25|$|Many {{advances}} in photographic <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> and printing were {{made during the}} rest of the 19th century. In 1891, Gabriel Lippmann introduced a process for making natural-color photographs based on the optical phenomenon of the interference of light waves. His scientifically elegant and important but ultimately impractical invention earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908.|$|E
25|$|When {{working with}} wet {{photographic}} plates, Swan noticed that heat increased {{the sensitivity of}} the silver bromide emulsion. By 1871 he had devised a method of using dry plates and substituting nitro-cellulose plastic for <b>glass</b> <b>plates,</b> thus initiating the age of convenience in photography. Eight years later he patented bromide paper, developments of which are still used for black-and-white photographic prints.|$|E

25|$|A modern type of {{absorptive}} polarizer {{is made of}} elongated silver nanoparticles {{embedded in}} thin (≤0.5mm) <b>glass</b> <b>plates.</b> These polarizers are more durable, and can polarize light much better than plastic Polaroid film, achieving polarization ratios as high as 100,000:1 and absorption of correctly polarized light as low as 1.5%. Such glass polarizers perform best for short-wavelength infrared light, and are widely used in optical fiber communications.|$|E
25|$|Leyden jars or more {{powerful}} devices employing flat <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> alternating with foil conductors were used exclusively up until about 1900, when {{the invention of}} wireless (radio) created a demand for standard capacitors, and the steady move to higher frequencies required capacitors with lower inductance. More compact construction methods began to be used, such as a flexible dielectric sheet (like oiled paper) sandwiched between sheets of metal foil, rolled or folded into a small package.|$|E

25|$|His {{expertise}} in color photography subsequently {{brought him to}} National Geographic magazine, where he was officially hired on July 23, 1934. The magazine prided itself on publishing quality color photography, and Marden was making good use of a lightweight Leica, which could hang from a single neck strap. Marden persuaded the magazine to see the benefits of using the small 35mm cameras loaded with the new Kodachrome film over the bulky cameras with tripods and <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> that were {{being used by the}} magazine's photographers at the time.|$|E
25|$|At first, little {{interest}} {{was shown in}} the parchment object itself. Madison had custody of it as Secretary of State (1801–1809) but having left Washington, he had lost track {{of it in the}} years leading to his death. A publisher had access to it in 1846 for a book on the Constitution. In 1883 historian J. Franklin Jameson found the parchment folded in a small tin box {{on the floor of a}} closet at the State, War and Navy Building. In 1894 the State Department sealed the Declaration and Constitution between two <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> and kept them in a safe.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Prokudin-Gorsky's death, the tsar {{and his family had}} long since been {{executed}} during the Russian Revolution, and Communist rule had been established over what was once the Russian Empire. The surviving boxes of photo albums and fragile <b>glass</b> <b>plates</b> the negatives were recorded on were finally stored {{in the basement of a}} Parisian apartment building, and the family was worried about them getting damaged. The United States Library of Congress purchased the material from Prokudin-Gorsky's heirs in 1948 for $3500–$5000 on the initiative of a researcher inquiring into their whereabouts. The library counted 1,902 negatives and 710 album prints without corresponding negatives in the collection.|$|E
