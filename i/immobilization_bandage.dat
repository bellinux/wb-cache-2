40|$|We {{present a}} case of a {{previously}} well 24 -year-old female patient who developed severe and life-threatening Irukandji syndrome that required ventilation and inotropic support. This case provides further evidence that there are jellyfish other than the Irukandji jellyfish that can cause cardiac decompensation, and there is a suggestion that application of a pressure <b>immobilization</b> <b>bandage</b> may worsen the envenomation. We include our recommended treatment for the Irukandji syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this paper}} was to review the {{literature}} relating to the use of pressure <b>immobilization</b> <b>bandages</b> in the first aid management of jellyfish sting in Australia and to attempt to make a recommendation about their use based on the current literature. Methods: A descriptive review of all published cases of jellyfish envenomation in Australia was performed, with specific focus on the discussion of pressure <b>immobilization</b> <b>bandages</b> in the management of such cases. A Medline search was performed using the key words listed for this article. Selected articles were reviewed and further publications were identified from the published reference lists given in the selected articles. Results: The published articles were grouped into three groups: in vitro evidence, case reports and editorial comment (either in journals or book). Fifteen references were identified that discussed the use of pressure <b>immobilization</b> <b>bandages</b> in the management of jellyfish envenomation. Other articles were identified that had significant management issues discussion. Conclusion: Most of the 'jellyfish' literature is in relation to envenomation by Chironex fleckeri. This jellyfish is usually found in tropical Australia and has resulted in the deaths of 67 people in Australia. The last death was near Cairns in 2000. Unfortunately, there are few good data on marine envenomations, with most of the literature being Chironex envenomation case reports. There are minimal data on the effect of pressure <b>immobilization</b> <b>bandages</b> on other jellyfish envenomations. There is no good evidence to support the use of pressure <b>immobilization</b> <b>bandages</b> in the management of jellyfish sting in Australia...|$|R
50|$|Although {{commonly}} {{recommended in}} folklore {{and even some}} papers on sting treatment, {{there is no scientific}} evidence that urine, ammonia, meat tenderizer, sodium bicarbonate, boric acid, lemon juice, fresh water, steroid cream, alcohol, cold packs, papaya, or hydrogen peroxide will disable further stinging, and these substances may even hasten the release of venom. Heat packs have been proven for moderate pain relief. Pressure <b>immobilization</b> <b>bandages,</b> methylated spirits, or vodka should never be used for jelly stings. In severe Chironex fleckeri stings cardiac arrest can occur quickly.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed to {{evaluate}} whether the application of pressure results in additional release of venom from naturally discharged, vinegar soaked nematocysts of the box jellyfish Chironex fleckeri. The results show that large quantities of venom are expressed with the application of pressures similar to that applied by compression <b>immobilization</b> <b>bandages.</b> The volume of venom expressed by this pressure {{was similar to the}} quantity expressed upon initial natural discharge of the nematocysts. The current recommended practice of applying PIB to cubozoan stings might worsen the envenomation. As the existing data now show that PIB may be detrimental to victims envenomed by cubozoans, we suggest that the current practice of the use of PIB in cubozoan envenomings be discarded until there is direct experimental evidence to support its use...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Jellyfish (cnidarians) have a {{worldwide}} distribution. Despite most being harmless, some species may cause local and also systemic reactions. Treatment of jellyfish envenomation is directed at: alleviating the local effects of venom, preventing further nematocyst discharges and controlling systemic reactions, including shock. In severe cases, {{the most important}} step is stabilizing and maintaining vital functions. With some differences between species, {{there seems to be}} evidence and consensus on oral/topical analgesics, hot water and ice packs as effective painkillers and on 30 s application of domestic vinegar (4 %– 6 % acetic acid) to prevent further discharge of unfired nematocysts remaining on the skin. Conversely, alcohol, methylated spirits and fresh water should be carefully avoided, since they could massively discharge nematocysts; pressure <b>immobilization</b> <b>bandaging</b> should also be avoided, as laboratory studies show that it stimulates additional venom discharge from nematocysts. Most treatment approaches are presently founded on relatively weak evidence; therefore, further research (especially randomized clinical trials) is strongly recommended. Dissemination of appropriate treatment modalities should be deployed to better inform and educate those at risk...|$|R

40|$|Background: A snakebite is a {{neglected}} extrinsic injury {{associated with high}} morbidity and global mortality. Members of Chinese field forces {{are at high risk}} of snakebites, and their perception and knowledge of snakebites are unknown. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess perception and knowledge of snakebites in field forces in southeast China; Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted in July 2016. A total of 216 field force members participated in this study; Results: A total of 10. 3 % had experienced snakebites and 86. 4 % rated their demands for knowledge about snakebite as “high”. No significant correlation between the actual and perceived snakebite knowledge status was detected (κ = 0. 0237, p = 0. 3852). Ineffective and harmful traditional first-aid methods, such as the application of tourniquets, sucking the venom out of the wound, and making local incisions, were used by more than three quarters of the respondents. However, pressure <b>immobilization</b> <b>bandages</b> were applied by only 17. 3 % of members. The proportion of responses for each question was not significantly different among the respondents when considering separate demographic groups; Conclusions: Snakebite knowledge among Chinese field force members is inadequate and in some cases misleading, when focusing on manifestation, prevention, and first-aid. A pragmatic, intensive educational scheme should be undertaken in at-risk populations...|$|R

40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} {{effectiveness of}} unloading <b>immobilization</b> <b>bandages</b> manufactured from Soft Cast and Scotchcast materials. Materials and methods. The study included all patients (n= 39) with diabetic foot ulcers {{treated with the}} use of total-contact cast technology (TCC) from 01. 10. 2007 to 01. 03. 2009. 31 patients presented with neuropathic foot ulcers and 8 with neuroischemic ulcers (in the absence of critical foot ischemia). 26 and 13 were managed using non-removable and removable casts respectively. All were given standard local treatment of ulcers, supplemented by antibacterial therapy in 20 patients. Results. Treatment resulted in the healing of ulcers in 31 (79 %) patients during 40. 5 +- 32. 9 days (M+-SD) (median 27, min 7, max 11 days). In 28 (72 %) of them, healing required 12 weeks to complete. TCC had to be removed in 8 (21 %) patients because of low efficiency or complications. New ulcers or abrasions related to the use of TCC developed in 10 patients but treatment was discontinued only in one of them. We distinguished a subgroup of 12 patients comparable in terms of major characteristics (plantar stage 1 A and 2 A neuropathic ulcers according to Texas University classification) and unloading method (non-removable cast throughout the treatment period) with patients included in earlier randomized studies. In this subgroup, healing of 100 % ulcers was completed within 12 weeks (median 22 (13 - 74) days). Conclusion. 1. Efficiency of TCC in our practice is comparable with that in earlier publications. 2. The use of TCC is indicated not only for the treatment of uninfected plantar neuropathic ulcers but also in some cases of neuroischemic and non-plantar ulcers. 3. Skin lesions from TCC is of little clinical significance and can be avoided by specialized education of the medical personnel involved in TCC manufacture...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) can prevent disuse (underloaded) -induced cortical bone loss as well as add extra bone to underloaded bones. Thirteen-month-old retired female Sprague-Dawley breeders served as controls or were subjected to simultaneous right hindlimb <b>immobilization</b> by <b>bandaging</b> and daily subcutaneous doses of 0, 1, 3, or 6 mg PGE 2 /kg/d for two and six weeks. Histomorphometric analyses were performed on double-fluorescent labeled undecalcified tibial shaft sections (proximal to the tibiofibular junction). Disuse-induced cortical bone loss occurred by enlarging the marrow cavity and increasing intracortical porosity. PGE 2 treatment of disuse shafts further increased intracortical porosity above that in disuse alone controls. This bone loss was counteracted by enhancement of periosteal and corticoendosteal bone formation. Stimulation of periosteal and corticoendosteal bone formation slightly enlarged the total tissue (cross-sectional) area and inhibited marrow cavity enlargement. These PGE 2 -induced activities netted the same percentage of cortical bone with a different distribution than the beginning and age related controls. These findings indicate the PGE 2 -induced increase in bone formation compensated for the disuse and PGE 2 -induced bone loss, and thus prevented immobilization induced bone loss...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) can prevent disuse (underloading) -induced cancellous bone loss. Thirteen-month-old retired female Sprague-Dawley breeders served as controls or were subjected to right hindlimb <b>immobilization</b> by <b>bandaging</b> and simultaneously treated subcutaneously daily with 0, 1, 3, or 6 mg PGE 2 /kg/d for two and six weeks. Histomorphometric analyses were performed on the cancellous bone using double-fluorescent labeled, 20 micron thick, undecalcified distal femoral metaphysis sections. We found that PGE 2 administration not only prevented disuse-induced bone loss, but also added extra bone to disuse cancellous bone in a dose-response manner. PGE 2 prevented the disuse-induced osteopenia by stimulating more bone formation than and shortening the period of bone remodeling. It activated woven bone formation, stimulated lamellar bone formation, and increased the eroded bone surface above that caused by disuse alone. While underloading increased the remodeling period (sigma), PGE 2 treatment of underloaded bone shortened the time for osteoclastic bone resorption and bone remodeling, and thus reduced the remodeling space. The study shows that PGE 2 is a powerful anabolic agent that prevents disuse-induced osteopenia and adds extra bone to these same bones...|$|R
40|$|SummaryClubfoot (talipes equinovarus) is a {{three-dimensional}} deformity of unknown etiology. Treatment aims at correction {{to obtain a}} functional, plantigrade pain-free foot. The “French” functional method involves specialized physiotherapists. Daily manipulation is associated to <b>immobilization</b> by adhesive <b>bandages</b> and pads. There are basically three approaches: the Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, the Robert-Debré and the Montpellier method. In the Ponseti method, on the other hand, the reduction phase using weekly casts usually ends with percutaneous tenotomy of the Achilles tendon to correct the equinus. Twenty-four hour then nighttime splinting in abduction is then maintained {{for a period of}} 3 to 4 years. Recurrence, mainly due to non-compliance with splinting, is usually managed by cast and/or anterior tibialis transfer. The good long-term results, with tolerance of some anatomical imperfections, in contrast with the poor results of extensive surgical release, have led to a change in clubfoot management, in favor of such minimally invasive attitudes. The functional and the Ponseti methods reported similar medium term results, but on scores that were not strictly comparable. A comparative clinical and 3 D gait analysis with short follow-up found no real benefit with the increasingly frequent association of Achilles lengthening to the functional method (95 % to 100 % initial correction). Some authors actually suggest combining the functional and Ponseti techniques. The Ponseti method seems to have a slight advantage in severe clubfoot; if it is not properly performed, however, the risk of failure or recurrence may be greater. “Health economics” may prove decisive in the choice of therapy after cost-benefit study of each of these treatments...|$|R
