500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{its debut}} album, Bleed the Fifth in early 2007 with production duties handled by former Machine Head guitarist Logan Mader. The {{title of the}} album is a play on words, Cazares comments [...] "You {{have the right to}} <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut,</b> but on this record we believe we’re saying a lot". Cummings wrote the majority of the lyrics, which are about personal strifes and how people overcome them. Much of the lyrical content was influenced by the Book of Revelation, natural disasters, war, and terrorism. Cazares stated the album is a [...] "big fuck you" [...] to the people who want his projects to fail.|$|E
500|$|Drummer Butch Vig {{stated that}} the album is a [...] "much simpler record than Version 2.0": [...] "All of the songs sort of came from us playing live downstairs [...] with guitar, bass and drums ... That was the only {{conscious}} decision we made – to make the songs simpler. Some of the songs are still layered in spots; compared to the last record, there're about half as many tracks. As far as sounds go, it's basically drums, bass, some heavy guitars and Shirley singing." [...] Erikson agreed that a more organic sound and simplistic approach with respect to production is embodied by the final mix of the album. [...] "A lot of songs took shape {{in just a few}} hours as opposed to a few months with the last record.Some of the songs obviously took a long time, or we wouldn't have been in the studio for a full year. But a lot of them happened very quickly. 'Silence Is Golden' we recorded basically in three days and it was done. 'So Like a Rose,' for the most part, was recorded in three hours. I think we spent a lot of time just trying to resist adding stuff to [...] Because that was our tendency on the other two records.” On the lyrical content of the songs, Vig remarked that [...] " [...] aren't specifically responses to the industry, but they could be read that way. Shirley has said that, for example, 'Shut Your Mouth' is about all the bullshit that's out there, but it's also a sort of note to self to <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut,</b> because she says she's the biggest, most opinionated loudmouth of anyone around. So they work on multiple levels." ...|$|E

That was what all the boys said, and my boy {{believed}} it, though {{he had never heard}} of anybody that it happened to. He believed that if you gave a chicken-cock burnt brandy it could lay eggs, and that if you gave a boy burnt brandy it would stop his growing. That was the way the circus-men got their dwarfs, and the India-rubber man kept himself limber by rubbing his joints with rattlesnake oil.|$|R
500|$|Whereas most Hollywood {{productions}} {{of the day}} took {{little more than a}} month to shoot, Wings took approximately nine months to complete in total. Although Wellman was generating spectacular aerial footage and making Hollywood film history, Paramount expressed concerns with the cost of production and expanding budget. They sent an executive to San Antonio to complain to Wellman who swiftly told him that he had two options, [...] "a trip home or a trip to the hospital". According to biographer Frank T. Thompson, Wellman approached producer David O. Selznick regarding a contract predicament asking him what he should do to which Selznick replied, [...] "Just <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut.</b> You've got 'em where it hurts." [...] The cast and crew {{had a lot of time}} on their hands between shooting sequences, and according to director Wellman, [...] "San Antonio became the Armageddon of a magnificent sexual Donnybrook". He recalled that they stayed at the Saint Anthony Hotel for nine months and by the time they left the elevator girls were all pregnant. He stated that Clara Bow openly flirted with the male cast members and several of the pilots which was reciprocated, despite having become engaged to Victor Fleming the day after arriving in San Antonio on September 16, 1926. Gary Cooper, appearing in a role which helped launch his career in Hollywood, began a tumultuous affair during the production with Bow. Cooper reportedly showed Howard Hughes the script to the film and he wasn't impressed, considering the drama in it to be [...] "sudsy", although he informed Cooper that he looked forward to seeing how Wellman would accomplish the technical aerial sequences. Bow strongly detested the costumes which were made for the film by Paramount designer Travis Banton, and slit the necklines and cut off the sleeves of his clothing, much to the chagrin of Banton.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} December 1974—a {{year before the}} invasion—the Indonesian defense attaché in Washington sounded out US views about an Indonesian {{takeover}} of East Timor. The Americans were tight-lipped, however, and in March 1975 Secretary of State Henry Kissinger approved a [...] "policy of silence" [...] vis-à-vis Indonesia, a policy that had been recommended by the Ambassador to Indonesia, David Newsom. However, the administration worried about the potential impact on US–Indonesian relations {{in the event that}} a forced incorporation of East Timor was met with a major Congressional reaction. On 8 October 1975, Assistant Secretary of State Philip Habib told meeting participants that [...] "It looks like the Indonesians have begun the attack on Timor." [...] Kissinger's response to Habib was, [...] "I'm assuming you're really going to <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> on this subject." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, in {{response}} to criticism from a historian Ron Radosh, a former Trotskyite who now writes for the conservative National Review—Seeger wrote a song condemning Stalin, [...] "Big Joe Blues": [...] "I'm singing about old Joe, cruel Joe. / He ruled with an iron hand. /He {{put an end to}} the dreams / Of so many in every land. / He had a chance to make / A brand new start for the human race. / Instead he set it back / Right in the same nasty place. / I got the Big Joe Blues. / <b>Keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> or you will die fast. / I got the Big Joe Blues. / Do this job, no questions asked. / I got the Big Joe Blues." [...] The song was accompanied by a letter to Radosh, in which Seeger stated, [...] "I think you're right, I should have asked to see the gulags when I was in U.S.S.R [...]" ...|$|E
