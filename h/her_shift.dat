The pub was located centrally in the city, only 50yards (46metres) from the police station and law courts, and near the city's central train station and the Gaumont Theatre (now The Mayflower). When <b>her</b> <b>shift</b> at the Tom Tackle ended at 23:00 (11:00p.m.) she went on to a night club in nearby London Road, in the company of her friend Jenni Savage.

500|$|In 1928, de Mena {{married a}} Cameroonian medical student, Milton Tube Ebimber, {{who had studied}} in Germany, Japan and China and spoke several African, Asian, and European languages. He was {{studying}} medicine at Columbia University when they married. Their opulent wedding, in which the bride was given away by her brother, David DeWitt Turpeau, was held at UNIA's Liberty Hall headquarters attracting wide coverage in the black newspapers. Soon after the marriage, Ebimber was arrested and imprisoned in the New York State Penitentiary on charges of bigamy. In 1929, she once again used de Mena as her surname. Beginning in 1928 and until <b>her</b> <b>shift</b> to Father Divine's movement, de Mena was the most visible officer in the UNIA. She {{was the key to}} increasing membership in the organization in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean and southern American regions. When Garvey reorganized the movement in 1929, she became the international organizer and the officer in charge of the Americas. She was seated on the dais at the convention that year and on its conclusion returned to the United States as its official representative. The following year, Garvey appointed de Mena officer-in-charge of North America and his personal representative in the U.S., as he had formally split with UNIA, Inc. in New York and created the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League of the World operating out of Jamaica. De Mena's [...] "forceful, riveting and entrancing style" [...] {{played a key role in}} keeping the movement alive after Garvey's deportation from the U.S. When Davis left the movement in 1931, de Mena became the sole leader, though many challenged her authority. Around the same time, de Mena reorganized the Costa Rican Port Limón branch of the UNIA, after factionalism had created a local branch which vied for authority with the parent organization.|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} <b>her</b> <b>shift</b> in {{the dining}} hall, Welden returned {{to her room and}} changed into walking clothes. Her clothing was adequate for the weather that afternoon but not for the anticipated drop in temperature that night. She packed no bag, took no extra clothing, and did not take any extra money. From all appearances, she did not expect to be gone more than a few hours. Welden walked down the campus driveway and hitched a ride from State Route 67A near the college entrance in North Bennington to a point on State Route 9 near the Furnace Bridge between downtown Bennington and Woodford Hollow. Local contractor Louis Knapp picked her up and drove her as far as his house on Route 9, about [...] from the Long Trail. From this point, Welden either hitchhiked or walked {{the rest of the way}} to the start of the Long Trail in Woodford Hollow.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{before the}} crash, the fourth officer screamed at the helmswoman {{to make a}} bold course correction--a 109-degree turn--and to switch off the autopilot. But she [...] "stated not knowing where the switch was located." [...] BC Ferries' report {{questions}} the validity of this evidence [...] "as the autopilot disengages simply with a single switch {{and would have been}} operated numerous times by the [...]" [...] However, in its own report, BC Ferries states the master found it necessary to post a note for navigational crew on how to operate the autopilot and included procedures for changing modes. Evidence was given that the woman at the wheel didn't know the location of the ship when she took over as lookout--or that the ferry was about to crash until she saw trees. She said she was asked to make only one, maybe two small course changes as directed by the fourth officer after she started <b>her</b> <b>shift</b> but that was...until just before the vessel hit Gil Island.|$|E

She left at approximately 11.20pm, planning to meet friends again later, and started the 15-minute walk home. It is believed that she argued with a man described as being in his mid 20s an estimated 25 minutes after leaving the pub in the laneway between Silchester Road and her home in Silchester Park. Witnesses heard a female voice expressing a cry of [...] "leave me alone", [...] "go away" [...] or something similar. [...] "Fuck off" [...] was also heard. This was followed by a scream. Raonaid was stabbed four times in the side, chest and shoulder with a one-and-a-half-inch sharp knife while in Silchester Crescent.
