25|$|Since October 2004, the iPod {{line has}} {{dominated}} digital music player {{sales in the}} United States, with over 90% {{of the market for}} hard <b>drive-based</b> players and over 70% of the market for all types of players. During the year from January 2004 to January 2005, the high rate of sales caused its U.S. market share to increase from 31% to 65% and in July 2005, this market share was measured at 74%. In January 2007 the iPod market share reached 72.7% according to Bloomberg Online.|$|E
500|$|The LS 460 {{interior}} {{gained a}} push-button start, thin-film transistor instrument display, and numerous luxury options, {{ranging from a}} hard disk <b>drive-based</b> GPS navigation system and song library to a heated steering wheel and XM NavTraffic. Standard equipment included power 16-way driver and 12-way front passenger seats with lumbar adjustment and seat heaters, leather upholstery, premium sound system, power moonroof, and trunk pass-through. The climate control offered the first infrared body temperature sensors in an automobile; it also featured ceiling air diffusers. An [...] "Executive" [...] seating package on the LS 460 L included a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, swivel tray table, and a shiatsu massaging ottoman seat.|$|E
2500|$|Hard <b>drive-based</b> {{players or}} digital jukeboxes: Devices that read digital audio files from a {{hard disk drive}} (HDD). These players have higher {{capacities}} [...] ranging up to 500 GB. At typical encoding rates, this means that {{tens of thousands of}} songs can be stored on one player. The disadvantages with these units is that a hard drive consumes more power, is larger and heavier and is inherently more fragile than solid-state storage, thus more care is required to not drop or otherwise mishandle these units.|$|E
2500|$|During its launch week, the {{original}} Zune, now Zune 30, was the second-most-sold portable media device with a 9% unit {{share in the}} United States: [...] behind the market-leading iPod's 63%. For the first 6 months after launch, NPD Group figures show that the Zune 30 achieved approximately 10% market share in the Hard <b>Drive-based</b> MP3 market and 3% in the overall MP3 player market. According to Bloomberg Television 1.2 million Zune 30 players were sold between November 2006 and June 2007, surpassing a milestone. A price drop on Amazon.com during November 2007 temporarily boosted the brown Zune 30 to the top [...] in electronics.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{generation}} of iPod was released October 23, 2001. The major innovation of the iPod was its small size achieved by using a 1.8" [...] hard drive compared to the 2.5" [...] drives common to players at that time. The capacity of the {{first generation}} iPod ranged from 5GB to 10GB. The iPod sold for US$399 and more than 100,000 iPods were sold before the end of 2001. The introduction of the iPod resulted in Apple becoming {{a major player in the}} music industry. Also, the iPod's success prepared the way for the iTunes music store and the iPhone. After the 1st generation of iPod, Apple released the hard <b>drive-based</b> iPod Classic, the touchscreen iPod Touch, video-capable iPod Nano, screenless iPod Shuffle in the following years.|$|E
2500|$|Some early iOS {{installs}} of Pokémon Go required {{users to}} provide the app with full access to their Google accounts, thereby allowing the app to [...] "access players' Gmail-based email, Google <b>Drive-based</b> files, photos and videos stored in Google Photos, and any other content within their Google accounts". The Pokémon Company and Niantic responded to the concerns, recognizing that the iOS app, at the time, [...] "... erroneously requests full access permission for the user's Google account ..." [...] However, Adam Reeve—the person who initially made claims of the security issues in a Tumblr post—later backtracked on his claim and was not [...] "100 percent sure" [...] it was valid. Dan Guido, CEO of the security company Trail of Bits, analyzed the app's programming and discovered that although the game did request full account access, this did not enable third-party usage as initially conveyed. Guido found that this did enable Niantic to access people's email addresses and phone numbers unintentionally. A subsequent iOS app update reduced the scope of access. Niantic also issued a statement assuring users that no information was collected nor was any information beyond what was necessary to use the app accessed.|$|E
2500|$|MP3 CD/DVD players: Portable CD {{players that}} can decode and play MP3 audio files stored on CDs. Such players were {{typically}} {{a less expensive}} alternative than either the hard drive or flash-based players when the first units of these were released. The blank CD-R media they use is very inexpensive, typically costing less than US$0.15 per disc. These devices have the feature {{of being able to}} play standard [...] "Red book" [...] CD-DA audio CDs. A disadvantage is that due to the low rotational disk speed of these devices, they are even more susceptible to skipping or other misreads of the file if they are subjected to uneven acceleration (shaking) during playback. [...] The mechanics of the player itself however can be quite sturdy, and are generally not as prone to permanent damage due to being dropped as hard <b>drive-based</b> players. Since a CD can typically hold only around 700 megabytes of data a large library will require multiple disks to contain. However, some higher-end units are also capable of reading and playing back files stored on larger capacity DVD; some also have the ability to play back and display video content, such as movies. An additional consideration can be the relatively large width of these devices, since they {{have to be able to}} fit a CD.|$|E

50|$|Portable Media Center (PMC) is a defunct hard <b>drive-based</b> {{portable}} {{media player}} (PMP) platform developed by Microsoft. Announced at the 2003 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), and released in early 2004, {{it was originally}} positioned as a competitor to Apple's iPod.|$|E
50|$|Hard <b>drive-based</b> {{recorders}} {{must offer}} {{a minimum of}} 160GB internal storage, with Digital Rights Management applied to recordings copied off the device. Restrictions must also be in place to ensure recordings can not be accessed if the hard drive {{is removed from the}} recorder.|$|E
50|$|The ProDigi format was {{extremely}} popular {{for use in}} country music. Specifically, at studios in Nashville, Tennessee, where {{nearly all of the}} large recording studios used Prodigi machines. The format fell from favor by the mid-1990s with the popularity of Digidesign's Pro Tools hard <b>drive-based</b> multi-track recording, editing, and mixing system.|$|E
50|$|The first-generation XL-7 was a Suzuki {{design and}} was {{essentially}} a stretched Grand Vitara. The North American version had a Suzuki-designed 2.5- or 2.7-liter V6 engine , on a rear-wheel <b>drive-based</b> platform with optional four-wheel drive. The UK version was also available with a 2.0-liter diesel engine, made by various manufacturers including Peugeot.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{magnetic}} recording, a double-system {{sound recorder}} {{was either a}} sound camera or a phonograph lathe. Once magnetic recording became viable, a succession of magnetic sound recorders, culminating in the Nagra, were the standard. As of 2007, most double-system production sound is recorded with hard disk <b>drive-based</b> [...] digital recorders, with a DAT backup.|$|E
50|$|The iAUDIO range {{consists}} of players based on both flash memory and hard disk drives. Flash memory-based players {{are available with}} a capacity of up to 32 GB, while the hard <b>drive-based</b> models currently have capacities up to 160 GB. The iAUDIO 6 was {{the first player to}} use Toshiba's new 4GB 0.85″ hard disk.|$|E
5000|$|Although the company's primary {{products}} are handheld remote control devices, {{it is best}} known for its [...] "Personal Jukebox" [...] digital audio player. Produced from 2000 until about 2003, the player was developed by and licensed to HanGo Electronics by Compaq. The PJB-100 was the first hard <b>drive-based</b> DAP and was first sold by Remote Solution in 1999.|$|E
50|$|With the MZ-RH1, Sony made {{tangible}} speed {{improvements to}} the device over previous generations of Hi-MD recorders. The result being that the transfer times to and from computer are—under certain circumstances—cut in half over previous models, but still noticeably slower than flash memory and hard <b>drive-based</b> portables, {{because of the nature}} of the Hi-MD magneto-optical system.|$|E
50|$|Philips GoGear is {{a series}} of small flash memory and hard <b>drive-based</b> {{personal}} electronic devices from Philips. The line includes digital cameras, digital audio players, and audio recorders. The GoGear line is named for the size of its products, all of which are rather small and portable. The digital audio players in the series are primarily designed to compete against the Apple iPod.|$|E
50|$|SiMotion {{controllers}} are all programmed using Siemens SCOUT, {{a software}} package which is IEC 61131-3 compliant and supports {{a variety of}} programming languages including Ladder (LD), Structured Text (ST), and Motion Control Charts (MCC). It allows central or distributed machine concepts to be realized as well as PC, controller and <b>drive-based</b> solutions, and also includes tools for testing, commissioning, and diagnostics.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, an {{employee}} of Honeywell's Physical Sciences Center, David Rafner, first described a <b>drive-based</b> DVR designed for home TV recording, time-slipping, and commercial skipping. U.S. Patent 4,972,396 focused on a multi-channel design to allow simultaneous independent recording and playback. Broadly anticipating future DVR developments, it describes possible applications such as streaming compression, editing, captioning, multi-channel security monitoring, military sensor platforms, and remotely piloted vehicles.|$|E
50|$|DVR {{devices such}} as TiVo became popular, making it {{possible}} to record television broadcasts to a hard <b>drive-based</b> digital storage medium and allowing many additional features including the option to fast-forward through commercials or to use an automatic Commercial skipping feature. This feature created controversy, with major television networks and movie studios claiming it violates copyright and should be banned. With the commercial skipping feature, many television channels place advertisements on the bottom on the TV screen.|$|E
50|$|Disk {{swapping}} {{refers to}} the practice of inserting and removing, or swapping, floppy disks in a floppy disk <b>drive-based</b> computer system. In the early days of personal computers, before hard drives became commonplace, most fully outfitted computer systems had 2 floppy drives (addressed as A: and B: on CP/M and MS-DOS - other systems had different conventions). Disk drives were expensive, however, and having two was seen as a luxury by many computer users who had to make do with a single drive.|$|E

50|$|The Routan {{features}} a rebranded version of Chrysler's hard <b>drive-based</b> audio and navigation system—marketed by Chrysler as the MyGig system and by Volkswagen as the Joybox, but has neither Chrysler's Stow'n Go nor Swivel'n Go seating systems. Instead, {{the second row}} seats in the Routan feature the Easy Out Roller Seat system, but can be modified using Chrysler or Dodge parts to have Stow'n Go or have Swivel'n Go seats installed. Routans as of 2010 offer optional Wi-Fi access, which was also offered in Dodge and Chrysler versions as UConnect Web.|$|E
5000|$|Heading {{the program}} was Anthony [...] "Tony" [...] S. Kuchta, who was {{appointed}} to the position by Ford management in 1986. Kuchta decided to retain a rear-wheel drive layout for the MN12 platform as a basis for delivering better road performance, as opposed to following the Thunderbird and Cougars' front-wheel <b>drive-based</b> rivals from General Motors, such as the Pontiac Grand Prix and Buick Regal. Kuchta also approved an independent rear suspension for the MN12 platform, something that would make the Thunderbird and Cougar the only rear-drive domestic cars other than the Chevrolet Corvette (and the later Dodge Viper RT/10) to feature this.|$|E

50|$|While MD {{had success}} in Asia (particularly in Japan and Hong Kong), North America and Europe leaned toward either flash or hard <b>drive-based</b> systems. For {{professional}} recording, many offer {{features such as}} professional XLR microphone inputs, among other pro-centric features. These units were typically significantly larger and heavier than a Hi-MD Walkman, often with reduced battery life and higher prices. It's for these reasons Hi-MD filled a niche for high-quality recording and editing purposes in a compact size—and still remains a quality playback device. Hi-MD recorders (and indeed standard MiniDisc) recorders are no longer being manufactured, but their role has {{been taken over by}} relatively inexpensive flash memory based portable field recorders (examples include the Edirol R-09HR and the Olympus LS-10).|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Sony {{positioned}} Hi-MD as a Digital Audio Tape (DAT) alternative, {{placing the}} MZ-M200 Hi-MD Walkman under the Pro Audio section of its [...] "Broadcast & Business Solutions Company" [...] website, alongside its flash memory-based recorder, the PCM-D1. Digital Audio Tape (DAT) is a high-quality digital tape format that found a niche with musicians and studios, and is valued for its high-quality sound reproduction. DAT portables have commonly {{been used for}} field recording, but have gradually been replaced by solid-state and hard <b>drive-based</b> units like the Aaton Cantar, the Zaxcom Deva, and similar units from Fostex and Sound Devices.

5000|$|When the {{standalone}} DVD recorder {{first appeared}} on the Japanese consumer market in 1999, these early units were very expensive, costing between $2500 and $4000 USD. However, as of early 2007, DVD recorders from notable brands are selling for US$200 or €150 and less, with even lower [...] "street prices". Early units supported only DVD-RAM and DVD-R discs, but the more recent units can record to all major formats DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD-R DL and DVD+R DL. Some models now include mechanical hard disk <b>drive-based</b> digital video recorders (DVRs) to improve ease of use. Standalone DVD recorders generally have basic DVD authoring software built in; however, {{the appearance of the}} finished DVD is very basic and usually completely {{under the control of the}} unit.|$|E
