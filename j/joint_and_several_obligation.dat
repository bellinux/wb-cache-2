Mr. Odo Russell explained to Mr. Gladstone (Feb. 27) that he was led to use the argument about England being compelled to go to war with or without allies by these reasons: that we were bound by a definite treaty to regard any retractation of the stipulations of March 30, 1856, as a cause of war;(227) that Gortchakoff’s assumption of a right to renounce provisions directly touching Russian interests seemed to carry with it the assumption of a right to renounce all the rest of the treaty; that Mr. Gladstone’s government had declared (Nov. 10) that it was impossible to sanction the course announced by Gortchakoff; that, therefore, France being otherwise engaged, and Austria being unprepared, we might be compelled by our <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> <b>obligations</b> under the tripartite treaty, to go to war with Russia for proceedings that we pronounced ourselves unable to sanction; finally, that he had never been instructed to state to Prussia, that the question was not one compelling us ever to go to war, notwithstanding our treaty engagements.

The author presents an overview of the current tax law treatment of married joint filers under which <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability is imposed unless relief is available under the new innocent spouse laws. The article then examines the tax rationales that have traditionally been offered for imposing <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability. The author concludes that because the fiction of marital unity is deeply embedded in our tax system, <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability for married joint filers is likely to remain the law. While it can sometimes promote legitimate goals of fairness and efficiency, as an examination of <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability in tort, agency and fraudulent conveyance law reveals, it can also produce unjust or irrational results.

First, we find that both <b>several</b> only <b>and</b> <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability induce firms to go bankrupt more often and create more waste than is socially optimal. Then we find that, for a given level of funds, <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability induces firms to go bankrupt more often and create more waste than several only liability. This implies that society will be responsible for a larger share of cleanup under <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability than under several only liability.

40|$|Major {{accounting}} {{firms in the}} United States have singled out elimination of <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability {{as one of the}} most needed legal reforms in the country. The recent legislation of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 replaced <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability with proportionate liability. This paper develops a simple model to analyze the economic consequences of such a change in the legal environment facing public accountants. In particular, we examine the incentive effects induced by the proportionate liability rule on the auditor's effort and financial statement users' litigation decisions. Our analysis demonstrates that replacing <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability with proportionate liability can decrease the equilibrium audit effort, lawsuit probability, market price of the firm, and audit fee. More important, even though the proportionate liability rule reduces the equilibrium audit effort, we show that it can actually increase social welfare. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Recent theoretical research by Kornhauser and Revesz finds that <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability may either encourage or discourage settlement, depending on the correlation of outcomes at trial across defendants. We extend their two-defendant model to a richer framework with N defendants. This extension allows us to test the theoretical model empirically using data on Superfund litigation. We find that <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> <b>several</b> liability does not discourage settlements and may even encourage them. Our results support the model 2 ̆ 7 s predictions {{about the effects of}} several variables, such as the degree of correlation in trial outcomes...|$|R

Contrary to popular belief, we show that transferring liability can actually increase the seller's incentive to invest in pollution abatement.
