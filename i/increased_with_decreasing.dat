30|$|To {{improve the}} {{controlled}} release, chemical stability, and bioactivity of Av, an Av nano-delivery system with different average particle sizes was synthesized using the emulsion polymerization method. The Av nano-delivery system showed consistent release behavior.

The biological {{activity of the}} Av nano-delivery system gradually <b>increased</b> <b>with</b> <b>decreasing</b> particle size, owing to enhanced adhesion and penetration.

The delivery system overcomes the shortcomings of current biopesticides, such as their environmental sensitivity, undesirable soil adsorption, and short activity duration.

Although the model predicted values were {{not the same as}} the experimental values, the trends in diffusion rate change with moisture content, as evaluated by the three different models, were similar to the experimental trends. The most likely reason for the differences between experimental and model values is that the p and r values used in the model in this study differed from the actual porosity of the wood specimen. Precise quantification of porosity in pits and rays is very important.|$|E
