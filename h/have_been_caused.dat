5|$|Hassium is {{not known}} to occur {{naturally}} on Earth; the half-lives of all its known isotopes are short enough that no primordial hassium would have survived to the present day. This does {{not rule out the}} possibility of unknown longer-lived isotopes or nuclear isomers existing, some of which could still exist in trace quantities today if they are long-lived enough. In the early 1960s, it was predicted that long-lived deformed isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities. This was theorized in order to explain the extreme radiation damage in some minerals that could not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>caused</b> by any known natural radioisotopes, but could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>caused</b> by superheavy elements.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{evidence}} of tumors, including hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, metastatic cancer, and osteoblastoma, {{was described in}} Edmontosaurus bones. Rothschild et al. tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including Brachylophosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, also tested positive. Although more than 10,000fossils were examined in this manner, the tumors were limited to Edmontosaurus and closely related genera. The tumors may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>caused</b> by environmental factors or genetic propensity.|$|E
