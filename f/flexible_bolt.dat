30|$|The fully grouted resin bolts {{with high}} {{strength}} and stiffness (AT bolts) are {{most widely used}} in Australian coal mines. The diameter of AT bolts is 22  mm, and the lengths of bolts in roof and in sides are usually 2.4 and 1.8  m, respectively. In general, AT bolts are used with W-shaped straps and steel wire meshes. To {{meet the requirements of}} greatly deformed roadways, rock bolts with higher strength were developed, and the yield strength of rebar is 770  MPa with a yield load of 260  kN and a broken load more than 300  kN. Many kinds of <b>flexible</b> <b>bolts</b> and cables were also developed. The <b>flexible</b> <b>bolts</b> are made of high strength steel strand with a diameter of 23.5  mm, a broken load of 580  kN, and a length of 6 – 8  m. It deserves to be specially reported that three kinds of self-boring rock bolts anchored by injection resin were developed in Australia, including general self-boring bolts anchored by injection resin, retractable self-boring bolts, and pretensioned self-boring bolts (Gray et al. 2010), which have provided an effective approach to reinforcing soft and broken rocks.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of light}} steel frames in rapid {{construction}} has grown significantly, especially concerning low and medium-rise buildings. However, there {{are limited resources}} available regarding the sway stiffness of light steel frames with <b>flexible</b> <b>bolted</b> joints. This paper presents {{a study on the}} lateral sway behaviour for light steel frames with bolted top-seat flange cleat connections comprising slender cold-formed steel sections. Two different sections, flexibility of beam-to-column joint and base conditions are the investigated variables. The result recorded showed that geometrics, joint flexibility and base conditions affect the sway stiffness of light steel frame. The increase rate is ranged from 29. 2 % to 47. 5 % for the identical tests for the effect of section depth. The ratio lies between 1. 10 and 3. 04 for the effect of connector thickness. In addition, beam-to-column bolted connections can contribute 34 – 88 % of the overall frame elastic lateral stiffness for pinned bases and 17 – 33 % for rigid base connections. Frame stability analysis with respect to global frame and column design were performed for the test specimens. Appropriate frame design analysis should be determined to provide a safe and reliable design for light steel frame considering <b>bolted</b> <b>flexible</b> joints and slender cold-formed steel sections...|$|R

Other applications include anchor <b>bolts,</b> <b>flexible</b> disk couplings, dehydration towers, compressor cylinders, compressor doghouse bolting, end plates, and gas compression engines.|$|R

Typically used to mount equipment module on structure. Mechanism includes kinematic mounts, which tolerate small initial misalignment and enforce precise final alignment as two assemblies brought together. Clamping force applied to kinematic mounts via two <b>flexible</b> plates. <b>Bolt</b> and nut tightened on flexible plates to impose spring clamping load.

40|$|International audienceLaboratory {{pull-out}} {{tests were}} conducted on the following rock bolts and cable bolts: steel rebars, smooth steel bars, fiberglass reinforced polymer threaded <b>bolts,</b> <b>flexible</b> cable <b>bolts,</b> IR 5 /IN special cable bolts and Mini-cage cable bolts. The diameter of the tested bolts was between 16 mm and 26 mm. The bolts were grouted in a sandstone sample using resin or cement grouts. The {{tests were conducted}} under either constant radial stiffness or constant confining pressure boundary conditions applied on the outer surface of the rock sample. In most tests, the rate of displacement was about 0. 02 mm/s. The tests were performed using a pull-out bench that allows testing {{a wide range of}} parameters. This paper provides an extensive database of laboratory pull-out test results and confirms the influence of the confining pressure and the embedment length on the pull-out response (rock bolts and cable bolts). It also highlights the sensitivity of the results to the operating conditions and to the behaviour of the sample as a whole, which cannot be neglected when the test results are used to assess the bolt-grout or the grout-rock interface...|$|R
50|$|In Europe, {{wooden frames}} with a middle section {{consisting}} of springs {{held in place}} by wire (to be put into the wooden bedframe as a unit) used to be the standard for most of the 20th century. The springs have mostly been replaced by pre-bent wooden slats (usually glulam made from beech or birch) which are joined to the outer wooden frame by some form of <b>flexible</b> rubber <b>bolt,</b> shoe or socket. This lath floor provides suspension, allows the mattress to ventilate, and can be designed to be vertically adjustable in order to elevate the legs and / or the torso. A more simple approach is to join straight laths with a textile strap {{so that they can be}} rolled up for transport and placed right into the bedframe.|$|R
25|$|Mole ploughs {{are usually}} trailed and pulled by a crawler tractor, but lighter models {{for use on}} the three-point linkage of {{powerful}} four-wheel drive tractors are also made. A mole plough {{has a very strong}} frame which slides along the ground when the machine is in work. A heavy leg, similar to a subsoiler leg, is attached to the frame and a circular section share with a larger diameter expander on a <b>flexible</b> link is <b>bolted</b> to the leg. The bullet shaped share forms a tunnel, about 75mm diameter, in the soil and the expander presses the soil outwards to form a long-lasting drainage channel.|$|R
40|$|Research on {{rock bolting}} {{technology}} has been extensively pursued, in both civil and mining engineering, for several decades. The study of bolting technology embraced initially rigid re-bars and subsequently <b>flexible</b> cable <b>bolts.</b> Generally, the past studies were focused on bolt strength and their load bearing capacities in relation to physical size (length and diameter) and material properties. Very little work has been reported {{on the influence of}} bolt surface configuration on the load transfer mechanisms between the bolt and the host rock. Also, previous research on the influence of bolting on rock joint reinforcement and stabilisation has been carried out under Constant Normal Load (CNL) conditions, which does not reflect the actual deformation behaviour of reinforced joints. This matter has lately been recognised, and some recent publications have highlighted the shortcomings of the tests conducted under CNL conditions. Accordingly, this thesis is concerned with various aspects of bolt research related to the better understanding of the load transfer mechanisms between the bolt/resin/rock, and the impact of infill on the reinforced joint shear strength under Constant Normal Stiffness (CNS) condition. Two types of bolts, commonly used in Australian coal mines were used for both laboratory and field investigations, and referred to as type I and type II bolts, respecively. The shear behaviour of bolt/resin interface was studied under CNS condition in the laboratory by testing cast resin/plaster samples in a specially constructed CNS apparatus. The samples were tested for various loading cycles at initial normal stress (σno) levels ranging from 0. 1 to 7. 5 MPa, representing the in-situ horizontal stress condition in the field. Laboratory test results indicated that, bolts with deeper rib profile and wider rib spacing (e. g. bolt type I) offers higher shear resistance at low confining pressures less than 6 MPa, whereas, bolts with shallower rib profile with narrower rib spacing (e. g. bolt type II) offers marginally higher shear resistance at confining pressures exceeding 6 MPa. The maximum dilation of the bolt/resin interface occurs at a shear displacement of about 60...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the behaviour of end-plate connections {{and the related}} topic of analysis of unbraced semi-rigid steel plane frames with criteria for their design. The static moment-rotation behaviour is investigated for connections consisting of <b>bolted</b> <b>flexible</b> end-plates, flush and extended end-plates, between I-section members, where the beams frame into the flanges of the columns. Attention is focussed on moment-rotation characteristics as {{this is the most}} important influence on the response of either individual members or complete frames. The non-linear nature of these characteristics is identified and methods of representing moment-rotation curves for subsequent use in analytical procedures are presented. A data base for such types of connection is created. An established computer program for second-order frame analysis has been extended to frames with semi-rigid connections. Successive estimates are made of the secant stiffness of these connections to represent their effect on frame behaviour. The analysis program has been used to study the effects of semi-rigid joints on frame behaviour. Studies have been carried out to extend the Merchant-Rankine formula for the assessment of the ultimate load of frames with semi-rigid joints over the application range of which was until now restricted to frames with rigid joints. A parameter entitled 'degree of flexibility' is introduced as a measure of the effect of semi-rigid joints on the stiffness of the frame. Within the limits of the study, it is demonstrated that the second-order effects will not be significant if the semi-rigid elastic critical load exceeds ten times the design load, and the degree of flexibility is less than 50...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{describe}} the modelling of large flexible objects in which bolted joints are used and also to present a new FEM calculation methodology of these objects. Design/methodology/approach: In bolted flange joints of <b>flexible</b> constructional elements, <b>bolts</b> are subject not only to tension and torsion but also to bending. Identification of straining of each bolt is only possible by means of numerical methods e. g. the finite element method FEM. In case of large objects, the calculation problem is faithful projection of the phenomena taking place in direct zone of the contact of screw-nut pair. The application of global equivalent models of the whole joint is necessary, to make it possible to precisely determine internal loads in individual bolts and then local models to determine stress fields necessary to assign durability. Calculation methodology based on the construction of two coherent models has been described: global - of an entire flange joint, and local - of a single bolt joint. Findings: The elaborated methodology was applied to estimate the flange joint in the heat exchanger with rotating heating surfaces that was subject to damage. The causes of damage of flange joint were found. Practical implications: Used methodology of FEM modelling of bolted flange joints based on two coherent models may be applied for different similar objects. The paper provides detailed description of methodology steps. Originality/value: The described methodology may be successfully applied to the analysis of large objects, however, significant geometric features with dimensions small in relation to dimensions of the whole object. Thanks to the application of two coherent models, it is possible to reflect all essential phenomena in the FEM model, both in the global scale - of the entire object, and local – a significant fragment of the joint...|$|R
50|$|The {{stator core}} is built with lamination's of cold rolled {{grain-oriented}} sheet steel 0.013 in (0.033cm) thick, insulated {{from each other}} with insuline. The number of segments per circle is arranged so that the maximum practical percentage of core flux is {{in the direction of}} the oriented grain. The rings of lamination's are built into a skeleton frame which is flexibly supported inside the main stator frame to prevent double-frequency vibrations being transmitted to the foundations. Axial gas passages are provided within the core by holes punched in the lamination's, which line up throughout its length. The ends of the core are divided axially by spacers into a number of radial ducts. These ducts form the gas inlet and outlet passages for the axial gas passages. Separate radial ducts feed the extreme ends of the core with cold gas to cater for the increased heating experienced at the core ends during leading power factor operation. Each coil side of the stator winding consists of rectangular copper tubes, each tube being insulated with resin-impregnated glass braid, and the tubes are transposed within the coil length by the Roebel method to minimise stray copper losses. Inlet and outlet manifolds are arranged at opposite ends of the windings and all coil sides are fed in parallel from these. The water connections between the manifolds and coil sides are made with flexible hoses of insulating material. The electrical connections between coil sides consist of <b>flexible</b> copper straps, <b>bolted</b> and sweated to contact blocks which are brazed to the conductor tubes near to the end of each coil side. The rings used to connect up the phase groups to the terminals are also water cooled, the flow through these being in parallel with the flow through the coil sides.|$|R
