In the game's , Arikado is playable as Alucard after he is found in the castle.|$|E
500|$|... "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] {{has been}} labeled as a satire on American politics. Michael Bitzer, in an edited book by Joseph Foy and Stanley Schultz {{entitled}} Homer Simpson Goes to Washington, said this episode [...] "espouses the virtues, vices, and varieties of American political culture, public opinion, {{and ultimately the}} American Dream." [...] Bitzer also wrote that The Simpsons, through [...] "skillful" [...] use of satire, demonstrates with this episode [...] "insights into the underlying political culture and public opinion of the United States' governing system (and, more broadly, society at large)." [...] In his book Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization, Paul Arthur Cantor said he was amazed by how far the episode [...] "willing to take its corrosive satire of national politics." [...] He said it [...] "attacks the federal government at its foundation, the patriotic myths upon which its legitimacy lies. It makes fun of the very process by which patriotism is inculcated in the nation's youth, the hokey contests that lead children to outdo each other in progovernment effusions." [...] When the corrupt congressman is arrested, Lisa proclaims [...] "The system works!" [...] Benedict Anderson wrote in the book The Spectre of Comparisons that series creator Matt Groening [...] "assumes that his tickled audience is confident that the system barely works [...] So why <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> to show a patriot at all, especially one who is a deluded little female block-head? Probably because he, too, wishes {{to be seen as}} giving America another chance. Mr. Lisa guarantees his good intentions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they have}} a wire from the shed," [...] she told him. [...] "Whatever <b>he's</b> trying to <b>do,</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> a very intense and {{concentrated}} light at times." ...|$|R
60|$|He read in {{her eyes}} that she {{understood}} him. And he dared not, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> to emphasize further his own intense desire that she should find a solution of her own.|$|R
6000|$|... "By this time," [...] he had said, [...] "I {{should have}} learned to wonder at nothing which John Carter accomplishes." [...] That was all. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not <b>need</b> {{to tell me that}} he {{appreciated}} the friendship which had prompted me to risk my life to rescue him, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> {{to say that he was}} glad to see me.|$|R
2500|$|Tell the King {{to spare}} his ships {{and not do}} a naval battle because our enemies are [...] much {{stronger}} than us in the sea, as men are to women. And why <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> to risk a naval battle? Athens for which he did undertake this expedition is his {{and the rest of}} Greece too. No man can stand against him and they who once resisted, were destroyed.|$|E
2500|$|In The Guardian {{obituary}} of Mandy Mitchell-Innes, Somerset and England cricketer of the 1930s and 1940s, {{the following}} is told: [...] "His (Mitchell-Innes') favourite memory was of sitting alongside Daniell at Taunton. Suddenly, Frank Lee, the batsman, {{was hit in the}} box. 'The box, you say,' thundered Daniell, a former England rugby captain. 'What namby-pamby nonsense is that?' A few minutes later it happened again and Daniell exploded: 'What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> a so-called box for? In my day, we hit fours with our private parts'." ...|$|E
2500|$|While his {{brothers}} indulged in fun and entertainment, Cao Gun was often seen reading {{and being in}} deep thought. The officials around Cao Gun discussed among themselves and said, [...] "His Majesty (Cao Pi) has ordered us to observe the Duke's behaviour. It's our duty to report to His Majesty when we see the Duke behaving inappropriately. However, when we see the Duke doing good deeds, we should also praise {{him in front of}} His Majesty." [...] They then wrote a memo to Cao Pi to praise Cao Gun. Cao Gun was shocked when he heard about it and he scolded the officials, [...] "It is one's responsibility to conduct himself with virtue and faithfully perform his duties. There's no need to tell anyone. Now that you've informed His Majesty, I feel more pressured and burdened. Besides, if one behaves well and does good deeds, why <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> to worry that no one will know? What you've done is not helpful to me." [...] Such was Cao Gun's humility.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Julia," [...] he declared, [...] "I am {{suffering}} {{just as much}} as you. I {{have the}} feeling that I have descended {{to the level of a}} common brawler. Yet what was I to <b>do?</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> the lesson very badly indeed." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Shasasa {{took the}} Magic Mirror and hid it beneath her pillow, {{and after that}} for many years Gopani-Kufa ruled his people both well and wisely, so that all men loved him, and never once <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> to ask Sipao to grant him a wish.|$|R
60|$|REGINALD. <b>Do,</b> maam. <b>He</b> <b>needs</b> it badly. Come along, Sykes. [He {{goes into}} the study].|$|R

6000|$|... "I hold {{but little}} {{discourse}} except with {{one and then}} chiefly of my own affairs," [...] returned the old man, without the least observable apprehension, and pointing imposingly upward; [...] "a Judge; and Judge of all. Little <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> knowledge from my hands, and but little will your wish to keep any thing secret from him profit you, even in this desert." ...|$|E
50|$|He led an uncommonly {{vigorous}} life. Only in {{his final}} few months <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> to use a wheelchair.

50|$|But {{he has yet}} to work on his qualifications. Hilario Davide III is {{currently}} serving as Cebu City councilor. Cebu City residents do not vote for Cebu provincial governor. Davide’s residence issue is being solved. According to reports, he will transfer his voter’s record to Argao. When <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> also to resign as Cebu City councilor.|$|R
50|$|Rava says, on {{each day}} <b>he</b> may <b>do</b> {{whatever}} <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> {{in order to}} survive, except for his Sabbath. But should he die on the Sabbath? He could prepare extra food the day before his Sabbath, but {{that might be the}} real Sabbath. So every day <b>he</b> may <b>do</b> whatever <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> in order to survive, even on the Sabbath. How is the Sabbath recognizable to him? By kiddush and havdalah he performs on his Sabbath but not on other days.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{could help}} {{decoding}} them and sending them through to Germany, though," [...] Kinsley retorted grimly. [...] "The {{worst of it}} is, he has a private telephone wire in his house to London. If he isn't up to mischief, what <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> all these things for--private telegraph line, private telephone, private wireless? We have given the postmaster a hint to have the telegraph office moved down into the village, but I don't know that {{that will help us}} much." ...|$|E

"Who is {{that little}} yellow one," [...] he said, [...] "that old {{one with a}} face like a skull," [...] and he pointed to Hans, who had kept as much out of sight as {{possible}} behind Mavovo, [...] "that wizened, snub-nosed one who might be a child of my brother the god, if ever he had a child? And why, being so small, <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> so large a staff?" [...] Here he pointed again to Hans's big bamboo stick. [...] "I think he is as full of guile as a new-filled gourd with water. The big black one," [...] {{and he looked at}} Mavovo, [...] "I do not fear, for his magic is less than my magic," [...] (he seemed to recognise a brother doctor in Mavovo) [...] "but the little yellow one with the big stick and the pack upon his back, I fear him. I think he should be killed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hero-worship? Ah me, {{that a man}} be self-subsistent, original, true, or what we call it, {{is surely}} the {{farthest}} in the world from indisposing him to reverence and believe other men's truth! It only disposes, necessitates and invincibly compels him to disbelieve other men's dead formulas, hearsays and untruths. A man embraces truth with his eyes open, and because his eyes are open: <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> to shut them before he can love his Teacher of truth? He alone can love, with a right gratitude and genuine loyalty of soul, the Hero-Teacher who has delivered him out of darkness into light. Is not such a one a true Hero and Serpent-queller; worthy of all reverence! The black monster, Falsehood, our one enemy in this world, lies prostrate by his valor; it was he that conquered the world for us!--See, accordingly, was not Luther himself reverenced as a true Pope, or Spiritual Father, being verily such? Napoleon, from amid boundless revolt of Sansculottism, became a King. Hero-worship never dies, nor can die. Loyalty and Sovereignty are everlasting in the world:--and there is this in them, that they are grounded not on garnitures and semblances, but on realities and sincerities. Not by shutting your eyes, your [...] "private judgment;" [...] no, but by opening them, and by having something to see! Luther's message was deposition and abolition to all false Popes and Potentates, but life and strength, though afar off, to new genuine ones.|$|E
5000|$|Holding such thoughts, Ran Qiu {{started to}} become lazy and {{felt it was}} useless {{no matter how much}} more he learned. In addition, Ran Qiu also {{attributed}} his poor performance in the class to his own insufficient abilities. He thought that, since he was not capable enough, he {{would never be able to}} achieve the level that Confucius was teaching, so why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> to study carefully? ...|$|R
60|$|The man's first kick, {{aimed at}} Harley's face, he blocked with his forearm; and, before {{the man could}} make a second kick, Jerry erupted on the scene. Nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> {{encouragement}} or direction from his love-master. He flashed at the man, sinking his teeth harmlessly into the slack of the man's trousers at the waist-band above the hip, but by his weight dragging him half down to the ground.|$|R
60|$|Tom, Philippa's husband, {{was driving}} his own car--he was {{rich enough to}} be able to--and seated with Philippa in the car was an unknown person, as prettily dressed as Philippa herself. To the rector she was {{presently}} introduced as Miss Catherine Something--he didn't hear the rest of it. Nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> to. It was quite plain that her surname, whatever it was, was a very temporary and transitory affair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come in," [...] he said; [...] "Geoffrey Ward {{is not a}} man to {{shut his}} doors in a woman's face on a night like this, nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>need</b> payment for such small hospitality. Come hither, Madge!" [...] he shouted; and at his voice a woman came down from the upper chamber. [...] "Sister," [...] he said; [...] "this is a wayfarer who needs shelter for the night; she is wet and weary. Do you take her up to your room and lend her some dry clothing; then make her a cup of warm posset, which she needs sorely. I will fetch an armful of fresh rushes from the shed and strew them here: I will sleep in the smithy. Quick, girl," [...] he said sharply; [...] "she is fainting with cold and fatigue." [...] And as he spoke he caught the woman as she was about to fall, and laid her gently on the ground. [...] "She is of better station than she seems," [...] he said to his sister; [...] "like enough some poor lady whose husband has taken part in the troubles; but that is no {{business}} of ours. Quick, Madge, and get these wet things off her; she is soaked to the skin. I will go round to the Green Dragon and will fetch a cup of warm cordial, which I warrant me will put fresh life into her." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tanner {{is known}} to have fought in the Korean War, when his sleep center was {{destroyed}} by a stray piece of shrapnel, making him a permanent insomniac.

5000|$|The {{inspiration}} for these early works was the countryside around Worcester itself, [...] "the cottages, farmhouses, lanes, hedgerows and churches, so exceedingly picturesque and beautiful".
