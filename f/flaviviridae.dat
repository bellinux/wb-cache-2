25|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{is a small}} (55–65 nm in size), enveloped, positive-sense {{single-stranded}} RNA virus of {{the family}} <b>Flaviviridae.</b> Hepatitis C virus {{is the cause of}} hepatitis C and some cancers such as liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, abbreviated HCC) and lymphomas in humans.|$|E
25|$|Flavivirus is a genus {{of viruses}} {{in the family}} <b>Flaviviridae.</b> This genus {{includes}} the West Nile virus, dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, Zika virus and several other viruses which may cause encephalitis, as well as insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) such as cell fusing agent virus (CFAV), Palm Creek virus (PCV), and Parramatta River virus (PaRV).|$|E
25|$|The {{hepatitis}} C virus {{belongs to}} the genus Hepacivirus, {{a member of the}} family <b>Flaviviridae.</b> Until recently it was considered to be the only member of this genus. However a member of this genus has been discovered in dogs—canine hepacivirus. There is also at least one virus in this genus that infects horses. Several additional viruses in the genus have been described in bats and rodents.|$|E
25|$|Agents {{considered}} for weaponization, or {{known to be}} weaponized, include bacteria such as Bacillus anthracis, Brucella spp., Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Chlamydophila psittaci, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, some of the Rickettsiaceae (especially Rickettsia prowazekii and Rickettsia rickettsii), Shigella spp., Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia pestis. Many viral agents have been studied and/or weaponized, {{including some of the}} Bunyaviridae (especially Rift Valley fever virus), Ebolavirus, many of the <b>Flaviviridae</b> (especially Japanese encephalitis virus), Machupo virus, Marburg virus, Variola virus, and Yellow fever virus. Fungal agents that have been studied include Coccidioides spp..|$|E
25|$|JEV is a {{virus from}} the family <b>Flaviviridae,</b> part of the Japanese {{encephalitis}} serocomplex of 9 genetically and antigenically related viruses, some which are particularly severe in horses, and four known to infect humans including West Nile virus. The enveloped virus {{is closely related to}} the West Nile virus and the St. Louis encephalitis virus. The positive sense single-stranded RNA genome is packaged in the capsid which is formed by the capsid protein. The outer envelope is formed by envelope protein and is the protective antigen. It aids in entry of the virus into the inside of the cell. The genome also encodes several nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, N4a, NS4b, NS5). NS1 is produced as secretory form also. NS3 is a putative helicase, and NS5 is the viral polymerase. It has been noted that Japanese encephalitis infects the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and rapidly accumulates substantial amounts of viral proteins for the Japanese Encephalitis.|$|E
25|$|Yellow fever {{is caused}} by the yellow fever virus, a 40– to 50-nm-wide enveloped RNA virus, the type species and namesake of the family <b>Flaviviridae.</b> It was the first illness shown to be {{transmissible}} by filtered human serum and transmitted by mosquitoes, by Walter Reed around 1900. The positive-sense, single-stranded RNA is around 11,000 nucleotides long and has a single open reading frame encoding a polyprotein. Host proteases cut this polyprotein into three structural (C, prM, E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5); the enumeration corresponds to the arrangement of the protein coding genes in the genome. Minimal yellow fever virus (YFV) 3’UTR region is required for stalling of the host 5'-3' exonuclease XRN1. The UTR contains PKS3 pseudoknot structure which serves as a molecular signal to stall the exonuclease and is the only viral requirement for subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) production. The sfRNAs are a result of incomplete degradation of the viral genome by the exonuclease and are important for viral pathogenicity. Yellow fever belongs to the group of hemorrhagic fevers.|$|E
