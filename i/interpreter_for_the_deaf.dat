It was assumed that the task of interpreting spoken English to ASL involved short term auditory storage, the efficacy of which was related to chunking abilities of the listener. Measures of short term storage for familiar and novel information (sentences) were employed by estimates of chunking efficiency. Three groups of ten subjects each made up the sample population. Group A was composed of individuals with interest in but limited knowledge of sign language. Group B was composed of individuals with no knowledge of sign language. Group C was composed of individuals holding the Comprehensive Skills Certificate from the National Registry of <b>Interpreters</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf.</b> Free-recall short term storage tasks were utilized to evaluate recall efficiency of <b>the</b> sample groups <b>for</b> familiar and unfamiliar information.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the history of}} oppression of <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> as a cultural minority {{and the ways in}} which interpreters may contribute to oppression. The paper then shows how interpreters can recognize and stop such oppressive tendencies and how they can instead empower <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> as an ally. Society views <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> as defective and requires that they conform to the hearing majority—a type of oppression called audism—this can cause interpreters to unconsciously form a negative view of their Deaf clients.

40|$|Abstract The {{grammar and}} {{vocabulary}} of higher mathematics {{are different from}} the grammar and vocabulary of conversational English and conversational American Sign Language (ASL). Consequently, mathematical language presents interpreters with a unique set of challenges. This article characterizes those aspects of mathematical grammar that are peculiar to the subject. (A discussion of mathematical vocabulary and its expression in ASL can be found elsewhere (Tabak, 2014).) An increased awareness of the grammar of mathematical language will prove useful to those <b>interpreters</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> and deaf mathematics professionals seeking to express higher mathematics in ASL. In this article one will, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time, find a model of mathematical language created <b>for</b> <b>interpreters</b> that identifies those aspects of the language that must be retained in any accurate interpretation. In particular, the article identifies the characteristic properties of propositions and propositional functions that must be preserved by the interpreter when propositions and propositional functions are expressed in ASL. It identifies the characteristic properties of mathematical language used in the definition of sets and in the statement of theorems that must be preserved by the interpreter when (mathematical) definitions and theorems are expressed in ASL. In addition, the article includes a method of symbolically representing mathematical language which is useful <b>for</b> analysis. <b>The</b> method enables the user to break down complicated-looking mathematical sentences into their simpler constituent parts in order to simplify the problem of interpretation.

40|$|The work of American Sign Language (ASL) /English interpreters {{is filled}} with complex interpersonal, {{linguistic}} and cultural challenges. The decisions and ethical dilemmas interpreters face {{on a daily basis}} are countless and <b>the</b> potential <b>for</b> disagreement regarding those decisions is great. Technology Mediated Dispute Resolution (TMDR) processes can be particularly helpful when misunderstandings and conflicts arise. Technology Mediated Dispute Resolution is a more inclusive phrase than Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) and includes cellular telephones, radio frequency devices, and satellite communication systems. <b>The</b> <b>Deaf</b> Community has learned to adapt and rely upon a variety of technologies and, because many Deaf individuals already are comfortable with technology, it makes sense to further integrate technology into dispute resolution processes. And while <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> Community can benefit from a greater reliance on technology, conversely, the communication skills that <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> community and interpreters employ routinely can provide valuable insights for everyone who uses new technologies to communicate and resolve disputes. David Allen Larson previously has addressed the opportunities and dangers inherent in technology. He believes that Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) practitioners and theorists must study how individuals increasingly are using technology to communicate. Those practitioners and theorists then must determine how those technologies can be integrated into dispute resolution processes most productively. He offers three distinct reasons why we need to approach technology in this manner: 1) teens and preteens, who soon will be adults, rely heavily on technology to communicate and we need to become competent in those technologies; 2) fuel prices continue to rise and technology allows us to communicate effectively without incurring travel expenses; and 3) security concerns have made physical travel less convenient and potentially less safe. This article examines the mediation process within <b>the</b> Registry of <b>Interpreters</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> Ethical Practices System and suggests when and how technology may be utilized to enhance that process. Background information regarding the interpreting profession, <b>the</b> <b>Deaf</b> Community and <b>the</b> process <b>for</b> filing and reviewing grievances provides a context for this discussion.

There are at present very few reports {{on the status of}} the lives and welfare of people with disabilities in Zambia. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the socio-cultural barriers that women living with disabilities in Kazungula and Livingstone districts experience in order to enjoy a full social life, placing emphasis on the status of their human rights. The CBR approach was used since it is a WHO approved method of rehabilitating and integrating people with disabilities into society. Livingstone and Kazungula districts were chosen as study areas to represent urban and rural areas. The study was performed qualitatively, and the data was collected through observations as well as individual interviews and focus group discussions. Barriers preventing women with disabilities from enjoying full social lives in these areas were physical, such as the lack of aids <b>for</b> <b>the</b> blind, <b>interpreters</b> or translators <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaf,</b> infrastructure to facilitate movement or access to buildings <b>for</b> <b>the</b> physically handicapped. In addition, poverty, dependence and negative attitudes were also identified as barriers. Poor education meant that the women could not compete favorably for formal employment and this made them unable to provide for their families especially that they did not receive any form of financial support from the government. On the cultural influence on families and relationship, the women in Kazungula were of the opinion that this was a significant barrier to social inclusion while their Livingstone counterparts responded otherwise. The respondents in Livingstone also had a much better knowledge of human rights and UNCRPD, than those in Kazungula who almost had no idea. In both districts, the responded felt that government was not doing enough to provide for them or to protect their human rights. The findings of this study suggest that women with disabilities in rural areas are at more disadvantaged than those in urban areas and therefore interventions should take into account this fact. <b>The</b> strongest basis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> barriers observed in this study was negative attitudes. In order to remove barriers, awareness campaigns aimed at changing people’s attitudes towards women with disabilities will be important. Secondly, having a job was found to be positively related to a satisfactory life style <b>for</b> <b>the</b> women with disabilities yet their educational backgrounds disadvantaged them from acquiring employment. Introduction of programs that empower the women and encourage them to be self-reliant will be essential in removing some of the barriers faced by these women. Finally, CBR has the potential of turning things around because it’s social strategies allow different players to enter and offer different forms of support to the same community. This is important as it does not over-stretch the resources of one organization while maximizing the overall results...|$|R
