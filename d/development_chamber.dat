40|$|The <b>development</b> <b>chamber</b> for an infrared, in-process densitometer, {{which will}} monitor and display a {{characteristic}} curve {{of a standard}} sensitometric strip during development, was designed. The monitoring radiation is to be emitted by a sequentially pulsed array of IR diodes (RCA SG 1009 A) and detected by an array of solid state detectors (UDT- 450 Photodiode/Amplifier combination). The output of the detectors, corresponding to IR transmission, is to be scanned, electronically converted into density, and displayed. Electronic scanning assures that processes with subminute total development time can be monitored. Optical losses of the system were estimated, and {{a model of the}} optical system was built and tested. It was shown that the densitometer will be capable of monitoring in-process infrared transmittance corresponding to dry white light neutral density of at least 3. 0.

No significant difference was detected in the precision of the method. However, the continuous linear <b>development</b> <b>chamber</b> afforded greater accuracy in aflatoxin determination and required only half the development time and {{a small fraction of}} the solvent used in the conventional TLC tank. The ability of different concentrations of aqueous acetone, aqueous methanol and aqueous acetone: methanol (1 ∶ 1) to extract aflatoxin from naturally contaminated maize was assessed. With each system, the amount of aflatoxin extracted increased as the ratio of organic solvent: water progressed from 50 ∶ 50 to 80 ∶ 20 and then decreased or remained constant when the composition of the extraction solvent was altered to 90 ∶ 10. 80 % aqueous acetone was found to extract 27 % more aflatoxin than the corresponding aqueous methanol with the mixed solvent system extracting an intermediate amount of toxin. Clean-up of 80 % aqueous acetone extracts of maize by elution through phenol (PH) bonded-phase cartridges resulted in poor aflatoxin retention when the proportion of acetone in 5 ml aliquots of extract was greater than 70 %. This could be increased to 100 % retention by the addition of an equal quantity of methanol prior to dilution with 1 % aqueous acetic acid and elution through the cartridge...|$|E

40|$|During heart <b>development,</b> <b>chamber</b> {{myocardium}} forms locally {{from the}} embryonic myocardium of the tubular heart. The {{atrial natriuretic factor}} (ANF) gene is specifically expressed in this developing chamber myocardium {{and is one of}} the first hallmarks of chamber formation. We investigated the regulatory mechanism underlying this selective expression. Transgenic analysis shows that a small fragment of the ANF gene is responsible for the developmental pattern of endogenous ANF gene expression. Furthermore, this fragment is able to repress cardiac troponin I (cTnI) promoter activity selectively in the embryonic myocardium of the atrioventricular canal (AVC). In vivo inactivation of a T-box factor (TBE) - or NK 2 -homeobox factor binding element (NKE) within the ANF fragment removed the repression in the AVC without affecting its chamber activity. The T-box family member Tbx 2, encoding a transcriptional repressor, is expressed in the embryonic myocardium in a pattern mutually exclusive to ANF, thus suggesting a role in the suppression of ANF. Tbx 2 formed a complex with Nkx 2. 5 on the ANF TBE-NKE, and was able to repress ANF promoter activity. Our data provide a potential mechanism for chamber-restricted gene activity in which the cooperative action of Tbx 2 and Nkx 2. 5 inhibits expression in the AV...|$|E
40|$|By {{the use of}} high {{performance}} solid-state infrared emitting diodes, matched infrared detectors, and a single chip 8 -bit microprocessor, an in-process infrared densitometer has been designed and constructed. The device is capable of recording the build-up of optical transmission density on an exposed film sample as it develops, with {{no effect on the}} normal development process. The most novel feature of this system is a special <b>development</b> <b>chamber</b> with eleven built-in infrared densitometers. These densitometers are located as to read every other step of a standard Kodak # 2 step-tablet exposure, and to allow the passage of developer across the film sample. As an example, every other step of a 21 -step exposure can be measured to produce a series of eleven density readings in approximately 22 milliseconds. These measurements can be repeated from once every second to once per minute {{at any time during the}} development process. The microprocessor that controls the infrared densitometer has memory capacity to store the data required to generate 187 complete D-Log exposure curves. At the completion of processing, the density readings recorded earlier are available for user viewing on a large seven segment digital display system, or can be reproduced on a line printer. D-Log exposure curves obtained from the device are in good agreement with curves obtained by conventional means. The device has a useful range of 0 to 3. 00 density units with an accuracy of +/-. 02 density units...|$|E
40|$|I {{undertake}} {{a case study}} of an innovative sub-national institution, the Regional <b>Development</b> <b>Chamber</b> of Greater ‘ABC ’ São Paulo, located in Brazil’s industrial heartland. An analysis of the Regional Chamber provides insights into how subnational actors can create coalitions that foster developmental ‘synergies’, even under adverse economic circumstances and in a highly fragmented polity. I provide an overview of the structure and initiatives of the Regional Chamber and provide an explanation for how and why the institution emerged. I argue that the workers ’ movement of the late 1970 s and 1980 s was instrumental in the formation of an active associational life in the region but, by itself, was insufficient to generate significant ‘social capital ’ since norms of trust and solidarity often failed to cut across class lines or across the public-private divide. Developing the potential for real developmental synergies, therefore, {{would have to be a}} political process in which regional leaders mobilized divided constituencies toward common purposes. I argue that this political process had four basic elements: (1) a systemic crisis in the region prompted reflection on the need for cooperative and regional solutions; (2) regional leaders engaged in a learning process of institutional trial and error; (3) effective political leadership emerged, reinforced by the growing strength of the Brazilian Workers ’ Party and citizen mobilization; and (4) labor-business relations shifted to embrace tripartite negotiations, fortifying a cross-class alliance in the region. My analysis of the chamber highlights local actors ’ capacity for strategic innovation under adverse conditions and, in particular, their ingenuity in reshaping statist institutions to meet the challenges of a post-statist era. * An earlier version of this chapter was presented at the Latin American Studies Association (LASA...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Hawthorn {{tincture}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} used herbal drugs at the domestic pharmaceutical market. According to the State register of drugs at the pharmaceutical market of Ukraine, there are 13 commercial offers of Hawthorn tincture from home-produced manufactures. The initial herbal raw materials for Hawthorn tincture are Hawthorn fruits, which are widespread at the territory of Ukraine. These are pharmacopoeial herbal raw material. Thus, 12 different species of Hawthorn fruits are included into monograph of Ukrainian State Pharmacopoeia (SPhU) and State Pharmacopoeia of USSR XI ed. On the territory of Ukraine there are near 30 different species of Hawthorn, and the quantity of species is much arises due to its forms and hybrids. The ‘natural variability’ of bioactive substances of Hawthorn fruits of the same species and possibility of usage of many different species during manufacturing process of herbal drugs lead to the pitfalls in standardization of herbal drugs in general, and Hawthorn tincture particularly, and should be taken in mind while development of its quality control methods. For development of specific and reproducible identification method, it is necessary to ensure the number of parameters: usage of method and equipment that give reproducible results; big selections of different samples; rigorously observation of method’s procedure of implementation. The modern, automated HPTLC method of analysis was chosen for identification purpose. If standardize procedure and suitable equipment are used, the reproducible results of the method have to be obtained. The aim of this paper was development of HPTLC method for identification of Hawthorn tincture, which could be appropriated for stability study and establishment of its expire date. Materials and Methods. In research 13 samples of Hawthorn tinctures from 8 manufactures from Ukraine and Russia were analyzed. These samples were manufactured in 2010, 2014, 2015 years. The research was conducted on the base of CAMAG laboratory, Muttenz, Switzerland. Plates used: HPTLC glass 20 x 10 cm, Si 60 F 254, Merck, Lot: 1. 05642. 0001. Material used: Automatic TLC Sampler 4, CAMAG; Twin Trough Chamber 20 x 10 cm, CAMAG; Chromatogram Immersion Device III, CAMAG; TLC Plate Heater III, CAMAG; Automatic <b>Development</b> <b>Chamber</b> ADC 2, CAMAG; Visualizer, CAMAG; TLC Scanner, CAMAG; Filter paper for chamber saturation, CAMAG; Centrifuge EBA 21, Hettich; Ultrasonic Bath SW 3 H, Sono Swiss; Analytical Balance MS 205 DU, Mettler-Toledo. Chemicals used were pharmacopoeial quality. Reference substances used: hyperoside, USP, batch: 33520 F; rutin, EDQM, batch: A 0299493; chlorogenic acid, EDQM, batch: A 0290470. For identification of Hawthorn tincture by HPTLC the flavonoids were chosen as a group of bioactive substances. The method was developed using format and style of description, which are used for TLC Identification method for Crataegi fructus in European Pharmacopoeia and SPhU. For new identification method of Hawthorn tincture preparation of test solution, reference solutions, system suitability solution (SST), intensity marker, its application, development and results were proposed. For specificity study HPTLC-fingerprints of 13 samples of Hawthorn tinctures, which were produced by manufactures, were compared with HPTLC-fingerprints of laboratory sample of Hawthorn tincture, prepared from properly authentificated herbal raw material of C. laevigata (C. oxyacantha) fructus (solvent – 70 % ethanol, ratio – 1 : 10) and HPTLC-fingerprints of C. laevigata (C. oxyacantha) fructus (solvent – methanol, ratio – 1 : 10). For reproducible results the research was conducted according to standardized procedure USP High-performance thin-layer chromatography procedure for identification of articles of botanical origin. Visual evaluation of chromatogram of test solutions was conducted with respect to zone position and colour of reference solutions, intensity was evaluated respect to intensity marker of reference solution. Results and Discussion. According to the proposed identification method by HPTLC, the fingerprints of 13 different samples of Hawthorn tincture are quite consistent respect to zone position, color and intensity. All analyzed samples of tinctures are met the requirements of proposed HPTLC-test. Comparison of HPTLC-fingerprints of 13 samples of Hawthorn tincture with the test solutions of laboratory samples of Hawthorn tincture and Crataegi fructus has shown quite similar fingerprints respect to zones position and color. This, prove the specificity of the method. Description of results for developed HPTLC method was given. The tolerance range in fingerprints was specified. Despite of the storage period of Hawthorn tincture is 3 years, the old samples of tincture, which were manufactured in 2010 year are quite similar to new one and would passed proposed HPTLC test. This shows the chemical stability of marker substances of tincture during its storage period. Other investigation in this area is necessary. Conclusion. The specific and reproducible HPTLC identification method of Hawthorn tincture was developed. This could be used as optional/alternative method for conventional TLC. Image on chromatogram of Hawthorn tinctures could be used as a reference image of HPTLC method for Hawthorn tincture and to be included in Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine or any other HPTLC Atlas/Reference book. Developed HPTLC identification method of Hawthorn tincture shown the stability of marker group of bioactive substances (flavonoids) during the expiration period of tincture...|$|E
