40|$|AbstractSeveral {{mechanisms}} predispose to {{bleeding in}} neoplastic disease. This {{is all the}} more serious as it often occurs on a background of medically vulnerable patients and the magnitude of the bleed may lead to hemorrhagic shock or acute respiratory distress as a result of hemoptysis. It often carries a poor prognosis, even if the acute episode has been controlled, as bleeding due to rupture of a tumor often indicates an advanced stage of the disease, and also because tumor rupture carries a risk of metastatic spread including peritoneal carcinomatosis. The risk of recurrent bleeding is also not insignificant. In most cases, endovascular <b>hemostatic</b> <b>embolization</b> is the first line palliative treatment...|$|E

One study showed, however, that embolization {{was associated with}} an approximately 10 % risk of recurrent bleeding and more rarely a risk of colonic ischemia [...]...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of percutaneous embolotherapy {{in cases of}} hemoptysis due to pulmonary tuberculosis from increasing severity of lung parenchymal injury was compared. The pattern of pleural involvement, as seen on chest radiography and angiography, were comparatively analyzed in 230 patients who were available for follow-ups from March 1992 to December 2003. Chest radiography findings were classified into 4 types based on levels of complicated lesions and pleural involvement. Angiography findings were divided into 4 groups based {{on the level of}} blood supply to lesions. Early hemostasis with respect to radiographic group were as follows: Type I- 92 % (73 / 79), Type II- 80 % (52 / 65), Type III- 70 % (42 / 60), and Type IV- 56 % (52 / 92); there was an average success rate of 73 % (219 / 296), and continued hemostasis was found in 80 % of Type I patients (62 / 77), 77 % of Type II patients (41 / 53), 62 % of Type III patients (25 / 40), and 45 % of Type IV patients (27 / 60), with an average longterm hemostatic rate of 67 % (155 / 230). Increasing severity of pleural involvement and associated complications correlated with increasing development of systemic collateral arteries other than the bronchial artery. The severely increased circulation in systemic collateral arteries makes it difficult to predict good <b>hemostatic</b> results following <b>embolization.</b> Therefore, we recommend aggressive treatment, such as surgical intervention, after embolization in such instances...|$|R
