25|$|The {{existence}} of this Slavic colony was first mentioned in the 1850s, and was unknown outside Italy until 1855 when linguist Medo Pucić from Dubrovnik <b>did</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his journeys to Italy and overheard a tailor in Naples speaking {{with his wife in}} a language very similar to Pucić's own. The tailor then told him that he came from the village of Živavoda Kruč, then part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 {{the family}} was reunited, and the Richters moved to Odessa, where Teofil taught at the Odessa Conservatory and, briefly, worked as organist of a Lutheran church.

25|$|The flight {{touched down}} at about 12:26 on runway 36R, and almost {{immediately}} the right landing gear collapsed.

The co-pilot received minor injuries as she evacuated the aircraft, as <b>did</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the five non-revenue FedEx pilots who were on board as passengers. It was later discovered that the non-revenue pilot who activated the slide for the emergency exit had not been adequately trained in its operation, and so accidentally pulled the handle that released the slide as a raft in the event of a landing on water, so that the slide detached from the airplane.|$|E
25|$|The Vicksburg Campaign was {{bogged down}} in early 1863, {{following}} the repulse of the Union forces under Brigadier General William T. Sherman at Walnut Hills (or Chickasaw Bayou) late the previous year. Major General Ulysses S. Grant wanted to keep his troops busy until he could begin active campaigning later in the spring, so he ordered them to undertake several moves {{that would give the}} appearance of activity but would not bring on a major battle. Grant, writing in his memoirs long after the event, stated {{that he did not have}} great confidence that any of them would prove successful, although he was prepared to take advantage of them if they <b>did.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> the operations he put in motion became known as the Yazoo Pass Expedition because it used a waterway of that name.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, Tordoff {{enrolled}} at Cornell University, {{where he found}} that {{his interest in the}} natural world could be pursued in a formal setting. While he was there, he met Robert M. Mengel (his lifelong best friend, later editor of the Auk), who encouraged his interest in ornithology, as <b>did</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his professors, Arthur Augustus Allen. His studies were interrupted by his military service during World War II, although he managed to complete some courses while in the military. After the war, Tordoff resumed his studies and in 1946 he graduated with a B.A. degree in zoology. In graduate school at the University of Michigan from 1947 to 1950 he studied ornithology under Josselyn Van Tyne and George Miksch Sutton, earning a Ph.D. with a thesis on the systematics of finches.|$|E
25|$|A {{priest of}} Aaron's lineage (i.e. Kohen) is {{forbidden}} by the Mosaic Law (Torah) {{to marry a}} divorced woman even {{if she were a}} native Israelite. Likewise, a male descendant from Aaron's line is prohibited to marry a Jewish woman who has had intercourse with a non-Jew, whether she had been raped or she had willfully done so. So, too, he cannot marry a Jewish woman whose birth was by a father who is a Kohen but who violated one of these prohibitions. If he went ahead and <b>did</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these three things, his male issue born from such union is no longer a priest (i.e. Kohen), but rather becomes a Ḥallal (Lev. 21:7, 14) - a term designating one who is no longer a priest, but profaned. A priest must maintain an untainted lineage, and his mother must be of Jewish birth. If he married a non-Jewish woman from the gentile nations, his children are no longer priests, but gentiles. Had a priest of Aaron's lineage transgressed this prohibition and married a divorced woman, and they had children together, all of his female issue - whether his, or his sons, or his grandchildren - would be prohibited from marrying into the priestly stock for all generations.|$|E
500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting.

500|$|The episode's director, Mark Kirkland, said {{he enjoyed}} {{directing}} the episode because the characters' emotions throughout it are [...] "very human and real". He believed many viewers watching the episode would recognize the emotions from experiences {{in their own}} lives, and would feel sympathy for the characters. The idea of Homer annoying {{the people at the}} movie theater was based on an experience Groening had with a friend of his when he was younger. They were sitting by themselves in a movie theater and two [...] "annoying" [...] women sat down right in front of them. Groening's friend told the women to move and they <b>did.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> the women then turned to Groening and his friend and said, [...] "Now are you satisfied?", to which Groening's friend replied: [...] "I won't be satisfied until I see you burn in hell." ...|$|E
500|$|No.24 Squadron's {{strength}} at {{the beginning}} of 1942 was four Hudsons, six Wirraways, and 130staff. On New Year's Day, Lerew led the Hudsons on a raid against Kapingamarangi Island, igniting a fuel dump that was still burning when the squadron returned to follow up the attack two days later. During 4–7 January, Vunakanau airfield suffered four raids by unescorted Japanese bombers, destroying {{all but one of the}} Hudsons. Although the Wirraways were scrambled to intercept attackers on several occasions, their rate of climb was so poor that only once <b>did</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them manage to engage an enemy seaplane, without result; this action, on 6January, was the first air-to-air combat between RAAF and Japanese forces. At this point, Lerew signalled headquarters for six [...] "modern fighters" [...] with which to defend his airfield; none were forthcoming.|$|E

[...] Bunmi Mojekwu, who plays Mercy Olubunmi, commented [...] "I feel so blessed to be part of EastEnders: E20. My first day on set was just crazy. I was on Albert Square – a dream come true – I'm enjoying every second." [...] Sam Attwater, who previously appeared in five episodes of Hollyoaks, was cast as boxer Leon Small. On his casting, he commented, [...] "It's a great privilege to be working with such great actors and on such an established show. It's an amazing opportunity and I'm really enjoying tackling a character like Leon who has so much going on," [...] He prepared for the role by attending a gym, as the character has a lot of topless scenes. He said: [...] "As soon as I heard that I was straight down the gym. Lots of crunches. Everyone said don't worry about it, but every time I <b>did</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those scenes I had to watch it back and see how it looked because there will be 10 million people watching it.

500|$|In 1967, Redding {{performed}} at the influential Monterey Pop Festival as the closing act on Saturday night, {{the second day of}} the festival. He was invited through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler. Until that point, Redding was still performing mainly for black audiences. [...] At the time, he “had not been considered a commercially viable player in the mainstream white American market.” But after delivering one of the most electric performances of the night, and having been the act to most involve the audience, “his performance at Monterey Pop was therefore a natural progression from local to national acclaim,...the decisive turning-point in Otis Redding’s career.” [...] His act included his own song [...] "Respect" [...] and a version of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Satisfaction." [...] Redding and his backing band (Booker T. & the M.G.'s with the Mar-Keys horn section) opened with Cooke's [...] "Shake", after which he delivered an impulsive speech, asking the audience if they were the [...] "love crowd" [...] and looking for a big response. The ballad [...] "I've Been Loving You" [...] followed. The last song was [...] "Try a Little Tenderness", including an additional chorus. [...] "I got to go, y'all, I don't wanna go", said Redding and left the stage of his last major concert. According to Booker T. Jones, [...] "I think we <b>did</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> our best shows, Otis and the MG's. That we were included in that was also something of a phenomenon. That we were there? With those people? They were accepting us and that was one of the things that really moved Otis. He was happy to be included and it brought him a new audience. It was greatly expanded in Monterey." [...] According to Sweet Soul Music, musicians such as Brian Jones and Jimi Hendrix were captivated by his performance; Robert Christgau wrote in Esquire, [...] "The Love Crowd screamed one's mind to the heavens." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Kelo fiasco {{eventually}} {{cost the}} taxpayers {{tens of millions}} of dollars, with nothing to show for it.
