5|$|The {{examination}} of skeletal remains often {{takes into account}} environmental factors that affect <b>decomposition.</b> Forensic taphonomy {{is the study of}} these postmortem changes to human remains caused by soil, water, and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals. In order to study these effects, body farms have been set up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the <b>decomposition</b> of donated cadavers. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of <b>decomposition</b> along with any other factors related to the <b>decomposition</b> process are studied. Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes <b>decomposition</b> to occur faster than clear plastic or the effects freezing can have on a dumped body.|$|E

If the tree can recover from the consequences of the wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing the larvae.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: New {{types of}} {{functional}} <b>decompositions</b> are presented {{which we call}} function-driven <b>decompositions.</b> Namely, it {{is shown in the}} paper that in the well-known Shannon formula it is possible to replace a variable by an arbitrary function having the property of self-duality with respect to a variable of the decomposed function. In this way a generalization of recently studied linear <b>decompositions</b> (used for constructing Linearly Transformed Binary Decision Diagrams) is obtained. Further extensions of functiondriven <b>decompositions</b> are also mentioned. These extensions can be defined by combining the functiondriven <b>decompositions</b> with other known <b>decompositions,</b> e. g. Reed-Muller (Davio) <b>decompositions.</b> It is also shown how to extend function-driven <b>decompositions</b> to multiple-valued functions. 1...|$|R

If a closure on a finite set is represented by its implication base (i. e. a binary relation on the powerset), we construct a polynomial algorithm to find its direct product <b>decompositions.</b> The main characterization theorem is also applied to define direct product <b>decompositions</b> of relational database schemes {{and to find out}} what properties of relational databases and schemes are preserved under the <b>decompositions...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose new {{algorithms}} for generating generalized hypertree <b>decompositions.</b> The well known heuristics for generating tree <b>decompositions</b> based on vertex ordering have been extended to produce hypertree <b>decompositions.</b> We investigate the generation of hypertree <b>decompositions</b> based on the tree <b>decompositions</b> of the primal and the dual graph of the hypergraph.

5|$|The LU <b>decomposition</b> factors {{matrices}} as {{a product}} of lower (L) and an upper triangular matrices (U). Once this <b>decomposition</b> is calculated, linear systems can be solved more efficiently, by a simple technique called forward and back substitution. Likewise, inverses of triangular matrices are algorithmically easier to calculate. The Gaussian elimination is a similar algorithm; it transforms any matrix to row echelon form. Both methods proceed by multiplying the matrix by suitable elementary matrices, which correspond to permuting rows or columns and adding multiples of one row to another row. Singular value <b>decomposition</b> expresses any matrix A {{as a product}} UDV∗, where U and V are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix.|$|E
