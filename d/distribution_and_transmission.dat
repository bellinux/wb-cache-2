[...] More snowmelt and precipitation can increase the amount of T. gondii oocysts that are transported via river flow. [...] Shifts in bird, rodent, and insect populations and migration patterns can impact the distribution of T. gondii due to their role as reservoir and transport hosts. [...] Urbanization and natural environmental degradation are also suggested to affect T. gondii transmission and increase risk of infection.|$|E

40|$|This letter proposes and {{demonstrates}} a fiber ring laser using taper-coupled double-microsphere-cavities (DMC) to achieve single-longitudinal-mode operation.

Due to the Vernier effect, the DMC can produce WGM spectra {{with a higher}} extinction ratio, a higher side-mode-suppression ratio (SMSR), a larger FSR and a narrower bandwidth, as compared to a single-microsphere cavity. A single-longitudinal-mode fiber ring laser operating near 1. 5 &#x 03 BC;m with a bandwidth of &#x 003 C; 0. 01 nm and a signal-to-background ratio of about 60 dB is demonstrated using the taper-coupled DMC as an all-fiber mode selector...|$|R
