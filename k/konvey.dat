40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to construct minimum transitive graphs of finite simple groups. A notion of minimum transitive graph has been introduced. Minimum graphs of <b>Konvey</b> groups has been created. Substitutional representations of some finite groups have been studied. A method of construction of minimum transitive graphs of finite simple groups has been developedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|There {{the study}} objects are 1 ChN 13 / 14, 4 Ch 10, 5 / 12, 8 ChN 12 / 12, 4 ChN 15 / 18 {{four-stroke}} Diesel engines, 1 D 4, 8 / 5, 2 two-stroke carburettor engine. The purposes are to develop tne study methodology of local heat exchange in the ICE, {{to solve the}} practical problems for decrease of heat-release rate. The mathematical models of convective and radiation heat exchange, the estimation techniques of influence of heat exchange on the indicated efficiency and on the variables of work process including two-stroke ICE have been developed. The experimental stands to research the heat exchange and the blachness degree of any part of cylinder-piston group of ICE have beem created. The test techniques have been developed. The measures to decrease the heat-release rate of ICE as the cross-over of exhaust gases, the hydrogen additive for the combustion zone, the up-dating of cooling system have been offered. The results have been brought in the Sibpribormash and <b>Konveyer</b> Enterprises, Biisk.
