The staff and voters of TelevisionWithoutPity both agreed Castiel was the 2008–2009 Most Welcome New Character on television, and BuddyTV's John Kubicek listed {{him as one of}} the ten [...] "TV Characters Who Deserve Their Own Spin-Offs". TV Squad ranked him as the top reason to watch the series, noting the [...] "slightly awkward, frighteningly precise angel... <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>an</b> amazing job of selling the underlying menace and vengefulness of God's most heavenly creatures." ...|$|E

On 8 January 2016, Tsakalotos began a tour of European cities, including Rome, Lisbon, Paris, Helsinki and Berlin, meeting with finance ministers, prior to a Eurogroup meeting on 14 January. In February 2016, Spyros Economides, Director of the Hellenic Observatory, commented on Tsakalotos' performance as Minister of Finance: [...] "In some ways, he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>an</b> extremely good job because the mess left by his predecessor both in substantive and presentational terms was horrific." [...] Tsakalotos visited the European Parliament in March 2016 and told MEPs of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that he welcomed their role in monitoring the reforms.|$|E

Everything is here, and I mean everything." [...] Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) called it [...] "a great translation considering its limitations," [...] 5 (November 1994), page 37. although a reviewer for The Detroit News felt [...] "very disappointed" [...] with this port and recommended the SNES version instead, which C+VG declared [...] "the most perfect coin-op conversion ever." [...] The four reviewers of EGM hailed the SNES version as a [...] "near-perfect" [...] {{translation of the}} arcade game. While commenting that its graphics and sounds are {{not as good as}} those of the SNES version, they held the Genesis version to be an outstanding port as well. A reviewer for The Baltimore Sun called the SNES version [...] "the best game I've ever played - a true translation," [...] while Patterson noted it was the bloodiest game Nintendo has yet allowed to be released.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, Ardai {{stated that}} [...] "Unlike many recent CD-ROM upgrades, {{which have been}} embarrassing and amateurish", the CD-ROM version [...] "has the stamp of quality all over it", with the added dialogue and sound effects [...] "like taking a silent film and {{turning it into a}} talkie ... It's hard to go back to reading text off a monitor after experiencing a game like this". He concluded that [...] "LucasArts <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>an</b> impeccable job ... a must-see". In 1992 the magazine named the title as one of the year's four best adventure games. Andy Nuttal of Amiga Format wrote, [...] "The puzzles are very well thought-out, with some exquisite, subtle elements that give you a real kick when you solve them." [...] He noted that the game is [...] "littered with elements that are genuinely funny". His sole complaint was about the game's linearity compared to Monkey Island 2; but he finished by saying, [...] "It's a minor point, anyway, and it shouldn't put you off buying what {{is one of the best}} Amiga adventures ever." [...] In 2008, Retro Gamer Magazine praised it as [...] "a masterful piece of storytelling, and a spellbinding adventure".|$|E
500|$|Tina Charles of TV Guide {{feels that}} Bobby [...] "totally rocks", and [...] "wouldn't mind him in every [...] OK, every other one". She pointed out Beaver's {{chemistry}} with Ackles, and wrote, [...] "I have always loved any scene {{we get that}} involves —they're unexpectedly emotional. When Bobby finally realized he wasn't talking to a Dean shapeshifter or revenant , {{that this was the}} real deal, it was just awesome." [...] Charles was surprised by Bobby's paralysis storyline, but became [...] "really interested" [...] in finding out how it would affect him. However, she posited, [...] "The guy's a spitfire...and it probably won't change him much." [...] IGN's Diana Steenbergen also praised Beaver, calling Bobby [...] "a valuable member of the team" [...] that [...] "broadens [...] tight-knit unit, reminding them that there is more to family than just blood ties". She found the actor to be [...] "fantastic as the broken Bobby" [...] in the fifth season, [...] "despondent over his situation and feeling useless". Steenbergen noted, [...] "Bobby has been through a lot this season, and Jim Beaver <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>an</b> outstanding job portraying his journey. Not solely a surrogate father figure and keeper of random supernatural knowledge, this season Bobby has run the gamut of sacrifice, loss, anger, and determination to keep fighting." [...] After watching Bobby confess his suicidal thoughts to Dean in [...] "The Curious Case of Dean Winchester", she felt that [...] "Beaver conveys all of Bobby's vulnerability and also the shame that comes from being reprimanded by Dean for wanting to give up".|$|E
500|$|In April2011, it was {{reported}} that Masood would kidnap Yusef, pour petrol on him and threaten to set him on fire. Yusef will then go to the Masood's house and tell Zainab what Masood <b>has</b> <b>done.</b> <b>An</b> EastEnders insider told the News of the World, [...] "Masood has never got over that. Tension has been simmering for a while and leads to an outpouring of violence from Masood that leaves Yusef seriously injured. But Yusef will get his own back. It is a twisted love triangle that will also show the sometimes brutal side of arranged marriages. It's not clear if their marriage will survive Yusef's meddling. [...] Yusef obviously wants [...] back and will do anything he can to drive a wedge between Masood and Zainab." [...] Ganatra said that Yusef will turn [...] "very manipulative and very nasty" [...] and Masood finds him as a big threat saying, [...] "He throws a real spanner in the works for Masood. [...] He is doing everything he can to wreck Masood's life, really, and the way you do that is to get to his family. It's a very clever way of doing things—it's not about destroying his family, it's about winning his family and turning them against him, so that Masood is left isolated and on his own." [...] Ganatra spoke of the storyline saying, [...] "I think there's rumours of revenge! Yusef is a really nice catalyst - he's a very exciting character to throw into the mix. If it goes that way, it's more drama for us to play." [...] The scenes were broadcast on 2June2011 with Phil Mitchell also taking revenge alongside Masood.|$|E

It was wrong for him to rush to the media to sing divergent tunes. No President anywhere in the world will allow that.

2500|$|In the Los Angeles Times, Kevin Thomas {{stated the}} film [...] "has found a perfect Oscar in the formidably talented Stephen Fry [...] [...] [...] Coupled with Julian Mitchell's superb script [...] [...] [...] and {{director}} Brian Gilbert's total commitment {{to it and}} to his sterling cast, this deeply moving Wilde {{is likely to remain}} the definitive screen treatment of Oscar Wilde for years to come [...] [...] [...] Gilbert clearly gave Fry and Law the confidence to play roles that would require a baring of souls, and they are triumphant[...] [...] Unfortunately, the film is marred by Debbie Wiseman's trite, overly emotional score, which has the effect of needlessly underlining every point along the way that has otherwise been made so subtly. It is especially undermining in its morose tone in the film's final sequences, when the pace naturally slows down as Wilde's life enters its final phase. Everyone else involved in the making of Wilde <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>an</b> exemplary job illuminating a man and his era." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that there were statues positioned {{on top of the}} lower level, {{on either side of the}} central, aediculum-like, niche of the upper level, as was common for this architectural form; Theseus and Hadrian are the most commonly advanced candidates for these two statues, based on the inscriptions. Ward-Perkins has proposed that the attic held additional multiple statues, located over the projecting Corinthian columns of the lower level. [...] In stark opposition to these proposals, Willers states that there is no evidence of the type of doweling needed to mount statuary on the top of the lower level and that the stone is far too roughly worked on the upper surface for statues to rest on it. [...] Although Willers <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>an</b> excellent study of the lower level of the arch, permission was not granted for close study of the upper level, so his statements concerning the upper level are based on previously published measurements and images. [...] A complete investigation of the monument, perhaps with limited excavation of the foundations as Willers suggests, remains to be done.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reasoning}} by {{the majority}} in American Communications Association v. Douds has not been well-received by legal scholars. One historian characterized the decision as combining [...] "guilt by association" [...] with the discredited [...] "bad tendency test". One legal scholar has called Vinson's heavy reliance on the Commerce Clause as [...] "implausible". Douds also seems to have got some facts wrong: The political strikes Vinson relied on for examples in the case were not Communist-led but rather routine labor conflicts. The majority (unwittingly or not) believed in a distinctly American myth about a monolithic Communist Party controlled from overseas, endowed {{with the ability to}} deceive American workers, and capable of bringing the nation to its knees through the use of political strikes. Vinson's balancing test had a decidedly pro-government bias, and the decision appeared to undermine a decade's worth of First Amendment decisions. Vinson's claim that the Taft-Hartley Act did not proscribe belief has been called [...] "sophistry." [...] And the majority's claim that any flaws in its approach can be easily rectified by appealing to the Supreme Court was not only scoffed at by Justice Black but has also been sharply criticized by legal scholars. (To be fair, some legal scholars disagree, and believe the Court <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>an</b> excellent job of protecting First Amendment rights.) ...|$|E
