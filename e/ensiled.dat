500|$|Animals used as {{livestock}} {{are predominantly}} herbivorous, the main exception being the pig {{which is an}} omnivore. The herbivores {{can be divided into}} [...] "concentrate selectors" [...] which selectively feed on seeds, fruits and highly nutritious young foliage, [...] "grazers" [...] which mainly feed on grass, and [...] "intermediate feeders" [...] which choose their diet from the whole range of available plant material. Cattle, sheep, goats, deer and antelopes are ruminants; they digest food in two steps, chewing and swallowing in the normal way, and then regurgitating the semidigested cud to chew it again and thus extract the maximum possible food value. The dietary needs of these animals is mostly met by eating grass. Grasses grow {{from the base of the}} leaf-blade, enabling it to thrive even when heavily grazed or cut. In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass). Other forage crops are also grown and many of these, as well as crop residues, can be <b>ensiled</b> to fill the gap in the nutritional needs of livestock in the lean season.|$|E
40|$|The {{brown seaweed}} Sargassum muticum is an {{invasive}} species to {{the coasts of}} the British Isles, mainland Europe and North America. Attempts at its eradication and control have generally not been successful, although time-consuming and costly. Commercial exploration of this biomass for fuel could encourage its harvesting and control. Anaerobic digestion (AD) has been suggested {{as one of the}} most promising methods of exploiting algae for biofuel. The harvesting of S. muticum is seasonal, and thus there will be a need to preserve and store seaweed to supply a year-round anaerobic digestion process. <b>Ensiling</b> is widely used in terrestrial agriculture, but there has been little research on <b>ensiling</b> seaweed. The aim of this research was to study the effect of <b>ensiling</b> on the biomethane potential of S. muticum and effect of size reduction prior to ensilage on leachate and other losses during <b>ensiling</b> and examine the mass balance and energy losses of <b>ensiling</b> S. muticum. <b>Ensiling</b> was found to be an effective, low energy loss method of preserving seaweed with energy loss from the biomass due to <b>ensiling</b> < 8 % of the Higher Heating value of seaweed feedstock. <b>Ensiling</b> results in losses of salt from the biomass and the virtual total loss of organic sulphur. Size reduction of seaweed prior to ensilage reduced leachate and energy loss from the biomass. <b>Ensiling</b> had no significant effect on methane yield. However, methane yields from S. muticum are low ≤ 0. 11 L CH 4 g- 1 VS at ~ 25 % of the theoretical maximum. Further research is needed to establish the reasons for the recalcitrance of S. muticum, but the C: N ratio of S. muticum is low (8 : 1), and co-digestion with a low nitrogen content substrate such as crude glycerol may be a potential method of improving methane yield...|$|R

The content of neutral detergent fiber(NDF) rapidly decreases 15 days after <b>ensiling,</b> which conforms to pH decreasing trend. In whole <b>ensiling</b> process, the crude protein(CP) and crude fat(CF) run away, and the content of crude ash(CA) and nitrogen-free extract(NFE) rises; the reason why the proportion occupied by these two items rises may be that the nutrient substance runs away and the content of dry matter decreases...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the dynamics associated with prolonged <b>ensiling</b> and aerobic deterioration of whole crop corn (WCC) silages and total mixed ration (TMR) silages containing WCC (C-TMR silages) to clarify the differences that account for the enhanced aerobic stability of TMR silages. Laboratory-scale barrel silos were randomly opened after 7, 14, 28, and 56 d of <b>ensiling</b> and were subjected to analyses of fermentation quality, microbial and temperature dynamics during aerobic exposure. WCC and C-TMR silages were both well preserved and microorganisms were inhibited with prolonged <b>ensiling,</b> including lactic acid bacteria. Yeast were inhibited to below the detection limit of 500 cfu/g fresh matter within 28 d of <b>ensiling.</b> Aerobic stability of both silages was enhanced with prolonged <b>ensiling,</b> whereas C-TMR silages were more aerobically stable than WCC silages for the same <b>ensiling</b> period. Besides the high moisture content, the weak aerobic stability of WCC silage is likely attributable to the higher lactic acid content and yeast count, which result from the high water-soluble carbohydrates content in WCC. After silo opening, yeast {{were the first to}} propagate and the increase in yeast levels is greater than that of other microorganisms in silages before deterioration. Besides, increased levels of aerobic bacteria were also detected before heating of WCC silages. The temperature dynamics also indicated that yeast are closely associated with the onset of the aerobic deterioration of C-TMR silage, whereas for WCC silages, besides yeast, aerobic bacteria also function in the aerobic deterioration. Therefore, the inclusion of WCC might contribute to the survival of yeast during <b>ensiling</b> but not influence the role of yeast in deterioration of C-TMR silages...|$|R

Maize forage is usually <b>ensiled</b> in cooler regions, but it can be harvested year-round in the tropics and fed as green forage to the animals. In the silage use case, it is usual for the entire plant (grain and stover together) to be chopped into pieces which are then crushed between rollers while harvesting. Maize silage {{is one of the most}} valuable forages for ruminants. In dairy farming, corn silage is primarily used as fodder for dairy cows during the winter season. Corn stover can be beneficial to beef cattle producers because the “corn stover can provide a low cost feed source for mid-gestation beef cows.” In addition to the stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs remaining in the field, kernels of grain may also be left over from harvest. These left over kernels, along with the corn stover, serve as an additional feed source for grazing cattle. Over time, the stalks will decrease in value as feed, so farmers aim to graze the corn stover as soon as possible after harvest. The amount of grazing possible on a field of corn stover is “between one and two months of grazing per cow per acre (50 cows on 50 acre for one to two months).” ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ensiling,</b> a wet {{preservation}} method, is {{an appropriate}} method of storing feedstock for biogas production. Fresh maize straw, contain enough water-soluble carbohydrates, is the prevailing material producing biogas, but research on preservation and storage of maize straw as feedstock for anaerobic digestion {{is still in its}} infancy. Generally in China, the free sugars are consumed, the water evaporates during wilting and field drying, giving rise to fail to achieve the demand of good-quality silage. In view of strong complementary in terms of physical structure, nutrient/moisture content of maize straw and vegetables, this paper propose a hypothesis of trans-seasonal mixed <b>ensiling</b> for biogas production. The objective of the current work was to evaluate effects of different mixed ratio of maize straw (MS) and cabbage wastes (CW) on silage quality, taking into account the silage quality, chemical composition and structural properties of feedstock. Mixed <b>ensiling</b> of maize straw and cabbage waste were prepared in 1. 6 -L plastic silos at 25 degrees C. The mixed mass ratios (MMR) of MS and CW were 19 : 29, 21 : 27, 23 : 25, 25 : 23, 27 : 21 and 29 : 19, respectively. The results show that the content of cellulose and hemicellulose after <b>ensiling</b> were increased, achieving the goal of seasonal storage for MS. When the MMR was 27 : 21, that is, the moist content was 73 % (MEMS 73), the pH value had a minimum and the content of lactic acid was highest after mixed <b>ensiling</b> for 30 days. Therefore, the optimum MMR of MS and CW was 21 : 27 for storage of maize straw.

The dent texture and the <b>ensiled</b> high-moisture grains proved the best option considering the starch degradability. Regardless of the conservation forms, the grains of corn hybrid flint texture should be finely ground, for providing higher ruminal degradation, while for the dent texture hybrid, the coarsely and whole grinding are the most suitable for <b>ensiled</b> and dry grain, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Two growing {{experiments}} compared {{effects of}} feeding a diet consisting of cornstalks or wheat straw and modified distillers grains when <b>ensiled</b> or mixed fresh daily. Wheat-straw based diets also were compared at different moisture levels (50 % and 70 %) when <b>ensiled</b> and mixed daily. In Experiment 1, steers fed <b>ensiled</b> diets had greater DMI compared to diets mixed daily. Moisture level and crop residue type {{had no effect}} on steer performance. In Experiment 2, steers were offered the supplements and a hay mix to determine palatability and forage replacement. Moisture level had no effect, cornstalks were consumed better than wheat straw, and steers fed freshly mixed diets gained more and were more efficient than those fed <b>ensiled</b> mixes...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of <b>ensiling</b> of alfalfa plant with sorghum plant on the chemical composition and nutritive value of silage mixtures using in vitro gas production technique. Chemical composition including; Dry Matter (DM), Crude Protein (CP), Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF), Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF), Ash Volatile Fatty Acids (VFA), lactic acid and pH were determind. Gas productions were determined at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h incubation times and their kinetics were estimated using the exponential equation Y = A (1 - exp• ct). The Organic Matter Digestibility (OMD) and Metabolisable Energy (ME) of the resultant silages were estimated. <b>Ensiling</b> of alfalfa plant with sorghum plant had a significant effect on the chemical composition, fermentation parameters, potential gas production, OMD and ME values of the resultant silages. <b>Ensiling</b> of alfalfa with sorghum plant increased the lactate and propionate production, OMD, ME but decreased acetate and butyrate production, CP content and pH of the resultant silage. As a conclusion, <b>ensiling</b> of alfalfa plant with sorghum plant will overcome some of the drawbacks related to low DM and water soluble carbohydrate contents and high buffering capacity of alfalfa plant...|$|R

40|$|Processing of the silage using cassava peel {{as energy}} source in dairy cow diets was studied. The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the chemical composition, degradability, lactic acid production and hydrocyanic acid content of various silages with varying cassava peel additions and <b>ensiling</b> times. The experiment was a 5 x 3 factorial design, completely randomized with factor A as the different formulated mixtures (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 % kg fresh weight of cassava peel) and factor B as the times of <b>ensiling</b> (14, 21 and 28 days). The results showed that cassava peel was appropriated to use as energy source in silage for dairy cows at 14, 21 and 28 days <b>ensiling</b> times. The content of hydrocyanic acid was at safety level for animals. The pH of all silages was in the range commonly accepted for international standard. The pH of good quality silage should approximately be 4. 2. The DM degradability was increased as the addition level of cassava pulp in the silage increased. Lactic acid content of silage was highest at 14 TH day <b>ensiling</b> time. The present study indicated that cassava peel and cassava pulp {{can be used as}} energy source in silage for dairy cows, particularly in Thailand where pastures are lacked during the dry period...|$|R
