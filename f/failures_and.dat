40|$|Fears of <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> {{success are}} widely {{regarded}} as salient threats to performance {{in a variety of}} domains yet scientific understanding of these constructs is still in its infancy. Sixteen elite athletes and performing artists participated in in-depth interviews to shed light {{on the nature of the}} cognitive-motivational-relational appraisals associated with these fears. Results revealed distinct criteria for evalu-ations of <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> success, as well as the perceived consequences of <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> success. It was concluded that the criteria used to evaluate <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> success are sufficiently distinct to suggest that perceptions of <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> success should not be thought of as a bipolar phenomenon. The consequences of <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> success were used to form multidimensional models of fear of <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> fear of success. Fear can be a fascinating and powerful emotional response to failure or suc-cess. Fear of <b>failure</b> (FF) <b>and</b> fear of success (FS) have somewhat controversial histories in the social and behavioral sciences, perhaps due in part to the lack of a unified theory to frame these constructs.

40|$|Background: Despite {{the fact}} that heart <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) often exist together and have serious clinical and economic implications, they have mostly been studied separately. Our aim was to study prevalence of coexisting heart <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> COPD in a Swedish population. A further goal was to describe levels of other comorbidity and investigate where the patients received care: primary, secondary care or both. Methods: We conducted a register-based, cross-sectional study. The population included all people older than 19 years, living in Östergötland County in Sweden. The data were obtained from the Care Data Warehouse register from the year 2006. The diagnosis-based Adjusted Clinical Groups Case-Mix System 7. 1 was used to describe the comorbidity level. Results: The prevalence of the diagnosis of heart failure in patients with COPD was 18. 8 % while it was 1. 6 % in patients without COPD. Age standardized prevalence was 9. 9 and 1. 5 %, respectively. Standardized relative risk for the diagnosis of heart failure in patients with COPD was 6. 6. The levels of other comorbidity were significantly higher in patients with coexisting heart <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> COPD compared to patients with either heart failure or COPD alone. Primary care was the only care provider for 36. 2 % of patients with the diagnosis of heart <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> 20. 7 % of patients with coexisting diagnoses of heart <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> COPD. Primary care participated furthermore in shared care of 21. 5 % of patients with the diagnosis of heart <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> 21. 7 % of patients with coexisting diagnoses of heart <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> COPD. The share of care between primary and secondary care varied depending on levels of comorbidity both in patients with coexisting heart <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> COPD and patients with heart failure alone. Conclusion: Patients with coexisting diagnoses of heart <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> COPD are common in the Swedish population. Patients with coexisting heart <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> COPD have higher levels of other comorbidity than patients with heart failure or COPD alone. Primary care in Sweden participates to a great extent in care of patients with diagnoses of heart <b>failure</b> alone <b>and</b> coexisting heart <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> COPD...|$|R

40|$|To date, {{researchers}} have largely considered service <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> recovery {{as a combination}} of individual constructs, often in isolation, rather than viewing <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> recovery holistically.

Furthermore, while some attempt {{has been made to}} gain a better understanding of service <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> recovery from both the customer and the employee’s perspective (cf.

Given this gap, our paper presents the value of taking a customer-based interpretive approach to obtaining a fuller understanding of the way customers view service <b>failure</b> <b>and</b> recovery. In this paper we report the findings of our phenomenography study of twenty in-depth interviews.
