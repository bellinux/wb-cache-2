If the customers divide the complicated <b>requirement</b> into <b>individual</b> <b>requirements,</b> the engineer {{who is in charge of}} software development can understand it easily. This is called division of requirement. However, the customers do not understand how much and how to divide the requirements.

5000|$|Integrated {{behavior}} trees: Because {{a set of}} requirements {{imply the}} integrated behavior of a system, all the <b>individual</b> <b>requirement</b> behavior trees can be composed to construct an integrated behavior tree (IBT) that provides a single holistic view of the emergent integrated behavior of the system. This enables {{the building of the}} integrated behavior of a system out of its requirements. [...] An analogy to help describe this process is the transition from a randomly arranged set of jigsaw puzzle pieces to putting each of the pieces in its appropriate place.

[...] Or, perhaps, there was a great dearth of provender, when, through the number of his servants and his own careful forethought, he was enabled to get supplies for himself; at such times he would send to his friends in different parts, bidding them feed their horses on his hay, since it would not do for the horses that carried his friends to go starving. Then, on any long march or expedition, where the crowd of lookers-on would be large, he would call his friends to him and entertain them with serious talk, as much as to say, [...] "These I delight to honour." ...|$|E

30|$|Although {{researchers}} have provided different understandings of requirement {{based on their}} own research areas, we can find the following common elements of such group requirements: requirement is perceptible; it is a state (internal/external, physical/virtual) of being short of something that is perceived by an entity through information acquisition. But not all short-of-something states result in requirement. There must be an equilibrium process during which those states can be satisfied. Requirements contain objectives and require resources the entity might have, such as money and problem solving capabilities. The subject-object relationship is unified in an <b>individual</b> <b>requirement.</b> As heterogeneity is exhibited in individuals’ characteristics, there should be cooperation among different individual entities if they want to fulfill their common objectives while maintaining their satisfaction.|$|E

Such resources include network bandwidth, disk bandwidth, processing power and memory. Inside the proxy server, these usages are scheduled during admission control upon new request acceptance. Scheduling schemes such as constant-data-length (CDL) and constant-time-length (CTL) seeking to improve these resources' utilization have been proposed. However they focused mainly on an <b>individual</b> <b>requirement</b> alone and this leads to inefficiency. In this paper, through an analysis of the relationship of resource utilization between individual schedules and their aggregate, we can determine the worst case requirements.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} a computer-based approach planning for manned helicopters in confined areas. The algorithms developed consider the procedures of pilots during the approach planning. Thus approach trajectories are generated which not only regard flight limitations, obstacles, terrain and airspace restrictions but also the pilot’s individual preferences and approach criteria. These factors depend on the flight missions and/or the pilot’s experience for instance. To get an idea which criteria are important and have to be regarded by the approach planning, a comprehensive survey among 80 air rescue pilots was conducted. Based on the results different types of approaches were identified which still have to be adapted to meet each <b>individual</b> <b>requirement</b> of the helicopter pilot. This adaptation can be conducted by the current pilot or the operator of the helicopter. The generated approach trajectories are evaluated by pilots...|$|E
40|$|In {{requirements}} engineering, numerous modelling {{approaches have}} been addressed to support communication and shared understanding, for instance, UML (use case diagram) and GORE (goal graph).

Recently, {{there has been an}} increasing need for a simple and an easy-to-learn modelling technique. We propose an icon-based language as an alternative to REmodelling. Unlike other RE notations, icon-based language is devised principally from a set of icons. Our approach can be derived by identifying RE world, defining icon world and combining these two worlds. This development yields the demand to have a modelling language that unifies requirements activities. The result can be used to overcome the communication barriers between technical and non-technical stakeholders, and to have icon attributes that can be attached to <b>individual</b> <b>requirement...</b>|$|E
