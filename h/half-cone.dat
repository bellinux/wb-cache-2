The computational results show that unsteady pulsating flow fields exit in all the cases and are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data.

As the capsule <b>half-cone</b> angle () is increased, the difference in the pressure distribution inside the canopy also increases, and the wake-shock interaction plays a more significant role in the unsteady flow mode.

40|$|The {{attitude}} {{dynamics and}} manoeuvre survey {{in this paper}} is performed for a mission scenario involving a penetrator-type spacecraft: an axisymmetric prolate spacecraft spinning around its minor axis of inertia performing a 90 spin axis reorientation manoeuvre. In contrast to most existing spacecraft only one attitude control thruster is available, providing a control torque perpendicular to the spin axis. Having only one attitude thruster on a spinning spacecraft could be preferred for spacecraft simplicity (lower mass, lower power consumption etc), {{or it could be}} imposed in the context of redundancy/ contingency operations. This constraint does yield restrictions on the thruster timings, depending on the ratio of minor to major moments of inertia among other parameters. The Japanese Lunar-A penetrator spacecraft proposal {{is a good example of}} such a single-thruster spin-stabilised prolate spacecraft. The attitude dynamics of a spinning rigid body are first investigated analytically, then expanded for the specific case of a prolate and axisymmetric rigid body and finally a cursory exploration of non-rigid body dynamics is made. Next two well-known techniques for manoeuvring a spin-stabilised spacecraft, the Half-cone/Multiple Half- cone and the Rhumb line slew, are compared with two new techniques, the Sector-Arc Slew developed by Astrium Satellites and the Dual-cone developed at Surrey Space Centre. Each technique is introduced and characterised by means of simulation results and illustrations based on the penetrator mission scenario and a brief robustness analysis is performed against errors in moments of inertia and spin rate. Also, the relative benefits of each slew algorithm are discussed in terms of slew accuracy, energy (propellant) efficiency and time efficiency. For example, a sequence of <b>half-cone</b> manoeuvres (a Multi-half-cone manoeuvre) tends to be more energy-efficient than one <b>half-cone</b> for the same final slew angle, but more time-consuming. As another example, the new Sector-Arc Slew and Dual-cone techniques are designed to overcome a specific restriction on attainable slew angle that is associated with the <b>half-cone</b> manoeuvre, giving one additional degree of freedom for designers to fine-tune. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
