40|$|Book synopsis: The {{present study}} aims at {{providing}} {{more than a}} straight <b>forward</b> <b>summary</b> regarding the ancient Cyclades. Its main purpose is to deal with geopolitical, economic, diplomatic, as well as cultural aspects {{of the interaction between}} the Archipelago and the different powers that dominated the Aegean area for a thousand years. For that reason, a total of twenty papers were included in this volume, based on both a historical and an archaeological approach. The authors of these studies have attempted to reconstruct the history of the ancient Cycladic societies under the Naxian, Parian, Samian, Athenian, Lagide, Rhodian, and finally Roman hegemonies. In particular, beyond examining the popular concept of domination, the present volume also intends to assess the history of the Archipelago from the 7 th c. BC to the 3 rd c. AD: under the conditions imposed by exogenous dominations, these islands witnessed the progressive birth of a new identity –the Cycladic one. Indeed, being both at the edge of their powerful neighbors’ spheres of influence and {{at the heart of the}} Aegean area, this circular ring of islands gradually evolved into the “Cyclades” in an ongoing relationship with these different hegemonies...|$|R

This presentation will focus on one such application: the estimation of global and national carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel consumption. In addition to the fossil-fuel statistics, these estimates also rely on a knowledge of fuel chemistry and combustion conditions. Personnel at the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), USA, have for three decades made annual estimates of fossil-fuel-derived carbon dioxide emissions. New releases of the emissions data are made each year when another year of fuel statistics becomes available from the UNSD. This presentation will briefly review how the emissions estimates are made on both a global and national basis. These estimates are only made after the completion of a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedure.

40|$|Abstract Background Developing novel {{drugs from}} {{traditional}} medicinal knowledge {{can serve as}} a means to improve public health. Yet countries in sub-Saharan Africa face barriers in translating traditional medicinal knowledge into commercially viable health products. Barriers in moving along the road towards making a new drug available include insufficient manufacturing capacity; knowledge sharing between scientists and medical healers; regulatory hurdles; quality control issues; pricing and distribution; and lack of financing. The case study method was used to illustrate efforts to overcome these barriers during the development in Nigeria of Niprisan – a novel drug for the treatment of sickle cell anemia, a chronic blood disorder with few effective therapies. Discussion Building on the knowledge of a traditional medicine practitioner, Nigeria’s National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD) developed the traditional herbal medicine Niprisan. The commercialization of Niprisan reached a number of commercial milestones, including regulatory approval in Nigeria; securing US-based commercial partner XeChem; demonstrating clinical efficacy and safety; being awarded orphan drug status by the US Food and Drug Administration; and striking important relationships with domestic and international groups. Despite these successes, however, XeChem did not achieve mainstream success for Niprisan in Nigeria or in the United States. A number of reasons, including inconsistent funding and manufacturing and management challenges, have been put forth to explain Niprisan’s commercial demise. As of this writing, NIPRD is considering options for another commercial partner to take the drug <b>forward.</b> <b>Summary</b> Evidence from the Niprisan experience suggests that establishing benefit-sharing agreements, fostering partnerships with established research institutions, improving standardization and quality control, ensuring financial and managerial due diligence, and recruiting entrepreneurial leaders capable of holding dual scientific and business responsibilities should be incorporated into future drug development initiatives based on traditional medicines. Country-level supporting policies and conditions are also important. With more experience and support, and an improved environment for innovation, developing new drugs from traditional medicines may be an attractive approach to addressing diseases in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions. </p...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of the major drought {{experienced}} during the 1970 s, the member countries of CILSS (Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel) launched the AGHRYMET programme. As its name indicates (an acronym for agro-hydro-meteorology), it is designed to make hydrological data more useful for agricultural purposes to ensure that optimum use is made of the little water resources available in the atmosphere, on the ground or in the water table. AGRHYMET's regional centre in Niamey co-ordinates the programme, by centralizing and processing the data from nine national meteorological services. Field observers provide daily readings of agroclimatological and meteorological conditions to the national centres which <b>forward</b> <b>summaries</b> to Niamey. This information is then processed and enriched with regional data provided by weather satellites and then sent back to the national services to pass on to interested users. The programme also incorporates observations made by certain public or private services {{as well as those of}} the Agency for the Security of Aerial Navigation in Africa and Madagascar (ASENCA). Having such information readily available enables better planning of agricultural activities, such as seeding times, predicting harvesting conditions or implementing emergency programmes to deal with insect invasions or disease outbreaks. It also improves the ability to evaluate future harvests by taking into consideration the meteorological conditions that prevail during the growing season. In the long term, the analysis of data collected over several years facilitates the task of national planning services when they need, for example, to introduce a new crop that will suffer minimum losses under rare but possible climatic conditions. Weather bulletins, maps or reports produced by AGRHYMET are not only destined for government agencies or international and national research organizations. The objective of AGRHYMET is to make such information available to end users, notably farmers, through extension services and the media. That is why after an initial phase dedicated to establishing its data collection and analysis system, this programme is now entering a new phase designed to ensure that its services can become a valuable working tool for farmers. If countries in the Sahel have been pioneers in this field more humid regions of Africa are now beginning to pay similar attention to better exploitation of agrometeorological information. It was in this context that a seminar on this subject was recently held in Benin (see article on page 16).

Therefore, a registration programme of ILD-prevalence was organised by the VRGT (Vereniging voor Respiratoire Gezondheidszorg en Tuberculosebestrijding), among about 100 Flemish pneumologists since 1990. Most categories of the classification by Crystal et al. (1) were included and the diagnostic criteria (histology, laboratory tests, clinic, radiology) were registered. The present paper presents the results of 1992 - 1994 : twenty pneumologists had <b>forwarded</b> the <b>summary</b> files of 237 patients to the central office in 1992 (n = 68), 1993 (n = 90) and 1994 (n = 79).

Less frequent causes were eosinophilic pneumonia (4 %), inhalation of inorganic material (4 %, anthracosilicosis being excluded), histiocytosis X (3 %), drugs (3 %), angiitis and granulomatosis (2 %), pulmonary hemosiderosis (1 %), lymphocytic infiltrative lung disease (1 %) and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (1 %). The order of relative frequencies of the different categories of diseases was the same in the 3 registration years. In 9 % of the patients the diagnosis was confined to "undefined fibrosis".

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} {{changes over time}} within patches of remnant rural vegetation after their inclusion in built-up settings. The dissertation is a compilation of four papers preceded by a summary part. The basis for the study is a unique data set collected over a 30 year period at Järvafältet, in the north {{western part of the}} city of Stockholm. Empirical contributions are made in three principal areas: recreational use of remnant vegetation, dynamics of remnant vegetation and conservation assessment of urban properties. In paper I the recreational use of areas with remnant vegetation close to and within built-up areas was found to increase between the two studied time periods, 1978 – 1982 and 2002 – 2004 with children being the largest user group. The dynamics of remnant vegetation studied in papers II and III were found to vary greatly depending on the specific vegetation's properties. Abandoned pastures were, apparently, not impacted at all. The forest field layer showed a modest and gradual composition change. Bryophytes experienced a curvilinear decrease in cover. Fruticose lichens growing on bedrock was rapidly and fully exchanged by crustose lichens and worn out ground was substantially formed on heavily worn areas. Wear and tear was assessed to be the major driver of the observed vegetation changes. In paper IV the development of a novel tool for the assessment of the biodiversity depletion state at the urban property-level, 'EcoEffect Outdoors – habitat depletion', is described. The dissertation's summary part provides a background to the study, a synthesis of the papers and an account of the author's part in the work presented. A short exposition of the research field including the most important associated research areas and a condensed review of the benefits of and the threats to remnant vegetation is also <b>forwarded.</b> The <b>summary</b> part also contains a general scheme for possible outcomes of wear and tear in patches of remnant vegetation. The scheme suggests a promising approach to the further development of our understanding of the importance of different vegetation processes in connection with wear and tear...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{and issues of}} social responsibility has {{become a part of}} everyday business and there are great expectations from customers and other stakeholders to disclose how they actively are working with sustainable development. The overall purpose of this report is to develop the key factors that should be included in sustainability reports in the forest industry in order to facilitate comparability and analysis of auditors' roles in the design and verification of the reports. The reports compares and analyzes the sustainability reports from the three largest forest companies in Norrbotten; Billerud, Sveaskog and SCA. Data has been collected through interviews because it gives more information from the respondents, which suits the purpose of the study. The companies’ sustainability reports include environmental, social and economic factors. Since each respondent individually has ranked four factors in each area, this report has taken <b>forward</b> a <b>summary</b> of the key factors in the forest industry. If all firms in the sector would report these factors and state accounting policies and made boundaries, a greater comparability between the companies would be achieved. That there is a new and not fully developed way to design sustainability reports is confirmed after analyzing all the interviews and respondents' thoughts and responses. The different interpretation from the auditors regarding the GRI guidelines shows that a development of these frameworks is necessary. The majority of the respondents in this report are requesting clearer information from the companies in the reports regarding to GAAP and boundaries that are made to enhance the comparability. They considered that this is what mainly missing today. In the case of auditors' roles there are three which are present: consultant, designer and reviewer. Auditing ensures the quality and thereby increases the comparability, because mistakes are detected and corrected.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} light-inducible and tissue-selective cell ablation using a genetically encoded photosensitizer, miniSOG (mini singlet oxygen generator). miniSOG is a newly engineered fluorescent protein of 106 amino acids that generates singlet oxygen in quantum yield upon blue-light illumination. We transgenically expressed mitochondrially targeted miniSOG (mito-miniSOG) in Caenorhabditis elegans neurons. Upon blue-light illumination, mito-miniSOG causes rapid and effective death of neurons in a cell-autonomous manner without detectable damages to surrounding tissues. Neuronal death induced by mito-miniSOG appears to be independent of the caspase CED- 3, but the clearance of the damaged cells partially depends on the phagocytic receptor CED- 1, a homolog of human CD 91. We show that neurons can be killed at different developmental stages. We further use this method to investigate {{the role of the}} premotor interneurons in regulating the convulsive behavior caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the neuronal acetylcholine receptor acr- 2.

40|$|The {{field of}} digital {{forensics}} {{has grown from}} an obscure area of interest amongst computer enthusiasts to become an emerging forensic scientific discipline of great significance in criminal investigations and civil litigations across the globe. The majority of digital forensic laboratories today are faced with ever-increasing legal and regulatory demands to meet internationally accepted rules regarding the admissibility of digital evidence, {{as well as being}} faced with various pending regulatory mandates requiring international accreditation of digital forensic facilities. These two major requirements, coupled with ever-increasing case backlogs and limited resources, have left many digital forensic labs to confront what initially seems to be an ‘insurmountable challenge’ to manage their caseloads, implement new regulatory requirements, and still find ways to improve overall efficiency and effectiveness. Based on the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) paradigms, the Digital Forensics - Comprehensive Capability Maturity Model (DF-C²M²) was born out of the findings of this research and the scientific gap that exists in the current digital forensics standards, best practices, frameworks, and models. This model has been developed through consultations and interviews with digital forensics experts. The DF-C²M² enables the measurement of maturity along three key organisational dimensions: people, processes, and tools, while enabling such an assessment to be tailored to a particular type of organisation, e. g., law enforcement or non-law enforcement. The inclusion of capability maturity across multiple key domains is designed to provide a more comprehensive capability maturity assessment of an organisation – across its three inter-dependants ‘influencer’ domains, when compared with other capability maturity models that focus on only specific domains such as processes, or on a sub-element of a domain. The model has been tested and evaluated as a management support and Capability Maturity Assessment system within two labs. One of the labs is an ISO 17025 accredited digital forensic lab within a law enforcement agency, while the other one is a non-accredited lab within an academic institute. The model will also serve as a stepping stone towards a timelier, more effective, and more efficient means of developing and implementing digital forensic standards and best practices moving <b>forward.</b> In <b>summary,</b> the DF-C²M² was designed to address the cited challenges by creating a modular management decision support framework to enable labs to better manage and achieve their objectives through a system of assessments and planning tools all geared towards measuring compliance and Capability Maturity across multiple domains...|$|R

40|$|The NIOSH Nanotechnology Research Center (NTRC) was {{established}} in 2004 to develop, coordinate, and deliver an organized program of research to identify, investigate, and develop science-based solutions to workplace health and safety knowledge gaps in nanotechnology. The NTRC provides overall strategic direction and coordination of the NIOSH nanotechnology cross-sector research program ([URL] The responsibilities of the NTRC are {{in accordance with the}} legislative mandate issued to NIOSH in Section 20 (a) (4) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, which states: " [...] . conduct special research, experiments, and demonstrations relating to occupational safety and health as are necessary to explore new problems, including those created by new technology in occupational safety and health, which may require ameliorative action beyond that which is otherwise provided for in the operating provisions of this Act. " Nanotechnology is a rapidly emerging material science technology that has been identified as a critical U. S. scientific and commercial enterprise with global economic benefits. Concern over the lack of knowledge about the potential health risks associated with the handling of pure, unbound engineered nanomaterials has been expressed by investors, entrepreneurs, government agencies, and public health advocacy groups. Such concerns create potential barriers to the growth of nanotechnology and the commercialization of products and devices that could help address serious global problems concerning energy, transportation, pollution, health, and food. Issues that have been raised about worker health and safety must be add ressed to ensure responsible development, societal benefit, and associated economic growth. Vision Statement: The NTRC facilitates responsible development of nanotechnology by identifying and addressing gaps in occupational safety and health knowledge. This vision is accomplished by creating a strategic plan of research, coordinating and facilitating the delivery of results, developing and disseminating science-based risk management recommendations, and providing national and world leadership. <b>Forward</b> [...] Executive <b>summary</b> [...] Abbreviations [...] Acknowledgments [...] 1.

40|$|Aim of {{the report}} This report {{provides}} a final assessment by DG JRC of the 'EU MIR form pilot' project, concerning the use of nomenclature for manufacturer incident reporting. The purpose of this analysis is to exploit the submitted data in view of addressing the following key questions: 1. 	Is reporting of adverse events using nomenclature feasible and helpful? 2. 	Are existing nomenclatures relating to device problems and evaluations of causes adequate? 3. 	Is there a need for introducing new terms, e. g. to cover novel technologies? 4. 	What are the {{lessons learned from the}} pilot study in terms of international harmonisation of nomenclatures (IMDRF) and development of future reporting tools (e. g. EUDAMED) ? Key findings This report focuses on the use of adverse 'event-type' and 'evaluation' terms which relate to problems with the medical device. The device-related terms were used in a 'Manufacturer Incident Report' form, which was designed for the pilot study, and was called the MIR pilot form. 786 forms, which were submitted by 13 manufacturers reporting from 15 European countries, were analysed. Concerning nomenclature usage, the report analyses whether incidents were reported adequately using (1) existing nomenclature (ISO/TS 19218), (2) newly introduced nomenclature (EDMA's IVD-related terms), and (3) newly proposed terms (by the participating manufacturers of the pilot study). The analysis has shown a number of important issues which concern five main topics: 1. Pilot data relate to approx. 50 % of device categories on the market Due to voluntary participation, the submitted MIR pilot forms reflect only a certain proportion of medical devices on the market. This needs to be considered when interpreting and using the pilot data. 2. No participation of SMEs in the pilot project Additional bias may be due to (1) the absence of SME participation; and (2) a single manufacturer submitting > 60 % {{of the total number of}} forms (bias towards a particular device category). 3. Adequacy of term selection by manufacturers We assessed the adequacy of term use by comparing textual incident descriptions with the categorised terms chosen by reporters. It was based on a set of 100 randomly selected pilot forms representative of the pilot's overall device portfolio. Both, the event-type and evaluation terms chosen by manufacturers for reporting incidents were largely adequate. Moreover, the analysis shows that three choices per level to describe the incident (event-type terms) or final investigation (evaluation terms) appear sufficient. 4. Available terminology (ISO/TS 19218) is not fully adequate On the basis of the frequency of some proposed terms it appears that the existing ISO/TS 19218 terms are overall not sufficient. This is not surprising given the fact that the terms were derived from FDA's terminology in 2005 and have, since then, not been updated. To resolve the most frequently encountered issues in the analysis, the JRC has proposed several changes to terms used (cf. Fig. 18 - 24). 5. Proposals for new terms by manufacturers ISO/TS 19218 uses a 2 -level hierarchical coding structure for reporting adverse events. Though the pilot study allowed for new proposals at these levels (level 1, 2), it was particularly designed for new proposals at an additional more granular third level. In line with this is the observation that the majority of new terms proposed concern level three terms. The analysis also showed that, although selection of existing terms was overall adequate, many of the new terms proposed by manufacturers are either redundant or do not reflect device problems but are, in fact, patient outcome terms. This clearly shows a need for reporters to have a better understanding of the terms and the reporting form used. Some of the confusion may stem from the simple fact that ISO's medical device problem terminology is called "Adverse Event Terms", i. e. seemingly suggesting that this nomenclature should be used to report adversity, i. e. clinical phenomena at patient / user level. In cases where level one event-type terms have been proposed, these related mainly (> 80 %) to the orthopaedic device category (cf. Fig. 13). It therefore appears that there is a need for a more elaborate nomenclature in this device category. Proposed terms that were deemed valid when compared with ISO/TS 19218 were subsequently compared with FDA's terms for device problems. This led to the identification of a number of proposed terms that could be proposed for incorporation into ongoing efforts in the development of a globally used nomenclature in the context of the work of the Adverse Event Terminology Working Group of IMDRF. EDMA has proposed new terms to cover specific needs of reporting incidents with in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDs). These were meant to complement the ISO/TS 19218 terms, and several of them have been used in the submissions. A closer look at the definitions of some of EDMA's terms does, however, show that they would need to be revised, for example four terms (corresponding to level 2) have identical definitions adding unnecessary ambiguity to their use. The report also provides in Annex I a summary of agreements reached during the workshop and topics that remain to be addressed when developing future tools for incident reporting including concerns voiced by stakeholders. Annex I also considers additional reflections made after the workshop and provides, as a synthesis, key recommendations for a way <b>forward.</b> In <b>summary,</b> this report shows that the outcome of the 'EU MIR form pilot' project has proven to be extremely useful for three reasons. 1. 	It confirmed the general feasibility of categorised reporting of incidents by manufacturers. 2. 	It identified inadequacies of the existing ISO/TS 19218 nomenclature suggesting the need for increased efforts into the development of freely available, scientifically and technically satisfying and, from a regulatory and end-user point of view, adequate nomenclature for adverse event reporting of incidents and events also in the pre-market space. 3. 	It led to the proposal of several potentially useful terms in view of future developments of nomenclature for incident / adverse event reporting. JRC. F. 2 -Consumer Products Safet...|$|R
