40|$|The {{prospects}} of quality young wine distillates production have been examined.

Characterisation of wine and distillates was based on chemical and instrumental methods and on their sensory evaluation. Volatile compounds were analysed and identified by GC-FID and GC-MS. The wine varieties Rhine Riesling, Müller Thurgau and Riesling have the potential for the production of quality distillates, suitable for maturation. Pinot White, Traminer and Chardonnay give more acceptable wines than distillates and it is therefore not advisable to use them for distillates production, while the varieties Pinot Gris, <b>Frankovka</b> and Steinschiller are not suitable for the production of distillates. ...|$|E

Epidemiological, experimental and clinical investigations have shown that diets supplemented with moderate quantities of alcoholic beverages lead to biochemical changes, that are widely regarded to prevent cardiovascular diseases. Red wine contains a naturally rich sources of antioxidants which may protect the body from oxidative stress. We investigated the relationship between red wine intake and lipide profile, glucose, blood pressure and WHR index changes. Participants consumed 200 ml of red wine <b>Frankovka</b> modra (VÍNO-MASARYK, s. r. o., Skalica) each day during supper for six weeks and were encouraged to maintain their usual diet and exercise habits. Daily intake of <b>Frankovka</b> modra during six weeks was associated with lower plasma levels of total cholesterol (5. 66 ± 1. 12 vs 5. 36 ± 1. 04), triglycerides (1. 68 ± 0. 23 vs 1. 47 ± 0. 66), LDL-cholesterol (3. 46 ± 0. 81 vs 3. 26 ± 0. 76) and glucose (5. 35 ± 0. 82 vs 5. 26 ± 0. 78).
