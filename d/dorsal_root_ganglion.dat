NaV 1. 7 is located in <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglions</b> and in nociceptive peripheral neurons. It has been hypothesized that mutations lead to a gain of function and hyperexcitability of peripheral sensory neurons contributing to symptoms in primary erythermalgia...|$|R
25|$|Primary erythromelalgia is {{a better}} {{understood}} autosomal dominant disorder. The neuropathological symptoms of primary erythromelalgia arise from hyperexcitability of C-fibers in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglion.</b> Specifically, nociceptors (neurons responsible for the sensation and conduction of painful stimuli) {{appear to be the}} primarily affect neurons in these fibers. This hyperexcitability results in the severe burning pain experienced by patients. While the neuropathological symptoms are a result of hyperexcitability, microvascular alterations in erythromelalgia are due to hypoexcitability. The sympathetic nervous system controls cutaneous vascular tone and altered response of this system to stimuli such as heat likely results in the observed microvascular symptoms. In both cases, these changes in excitability are typically due to mutation of the sodium channel NaV1.7. These differences in excitability alterations between the sympathetic nervous system and nociceptors is due to different expression of sodium channels other than NaV1.7 in them.|$|E
25|$|There are 10 known {{mutations}} in the voltage-gated sodium channel α-subunit NaV1.7 encoding gene, SCN9A. This channel is expressed primarily in nociceptors of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglion</b> and the sympathetic ganglion neurons. Nine of these mutations have received further study {{and they have}} all shown to result in similar biophysical alterations, Table 1. As {{can be seen from}} table 1, the primary effect of erythromelalgia mutations is NaV1.7 channels that activate at more hyperpolarized potentials. NaV1.7 channels act largely as threshold sensors and initiate action potentials. Consequently, this shift in their activation profile results in channels that open closer to the resting membrane potential. In many mutations, this shift of activation is accompanied by shifts in the voltage sensitivity of fast and/or slow inactivation, often in the depolarized direction. This results in channels that are open for a longer of period of time, producing larger and more prolonged changes in membrane potential.|$|E
25|$|C fiber axons {{are grouped}} {{together}} {{into what is}} known as Remak bundles. These occur when an unmyelinated Schwann cell bundles the axons close together by surrounding them. The Schwann cell keeps them from touching each other by squeezing its cytoplasm between the axons. The condition of Remak bundles varies with age. The number of C fiber axons in each Remak bundle varies with location. For example, in a rat model, large bundles of greater than 20 axons are found exiting the L5 <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglion,</b> while smaller bundles of average 3 axons are found in distal nerve segments. Multiple neurons contribute axons to the Remak bundle with an average ratio of about 2 axons contributed per bundle. The cross sectional area of a Remak bundle is proportional to the number of axons found inside it. Remak bundles in the distal peripheral nerve are clustered with other Remak bundles. The Remak Schwann cells {{have been shown to be}} electrochemically responsive to action potentials of the axons contained within them.|$|E

40|$|Neuropathic pain {{remains a}} {{prevalent}} and persistent clinical problem {{because it is}} often poorly responsive to the currently used analgesics. It is very urgent to develop novel drugs to alleviate neuropathic pain. Galectin- 3 (gal 3) is a multifunctional protein belonging to the carbohydrate-ligand lectin family, which is expressed by different cells. Emerging studies showed that gal 3 elicits a pro-inflammatory response by recruiting and activating lymphocytes, macrophages and microglia. In the study we investigated whether gal 3 inhibition could suppress neuroinflammation and alleviate neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury. We found that L 5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) increases the expression of gal 3 in <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglions</b> at the mRNA and protein level. Intrathecal administration of modified citrus pectin (MCP), a gal 3 inhibitor, reduces gal 3 expression in <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglions.</b> MCP treatment also inhibits SNL-induced gal 3 expression in primary rat microglia. SNL results in an increased activation of autophagy that contributes to microglial activation and subsequent inflammatory response. Intrathecal administration of MCP significantly suppresses SNL-induced autophagy activation. MCP also inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced autophagy in cultured microglia in vitro. MCP further decreases LPS-induced expression of proinflammatory mediators including IL- 1 β, TNF-α and IL- 6 by regulating autophagy. Intrathecal administration of MCP results in adecreased mechanical and cold hypersensitivity following SNL.

25|$|Some {{of these}} mutant {{channels}} have been expressed in <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglion</b> (DRG) or sympathetic neurons. In DRG neurons expressing the F1449V mutation, a lower threshold {{is required for}} action potential creation (93.1 ± 12.0 pA) than those expressing wild-type channels (124.1 ± 7.4 pA). Furthermore, while DRG neurons expressing wild-type channels only respond with a few action potentials, those expressing F1449V channels respond with a high-frequency train of action potentials. There is a similar effect in DRG neurons expressing the L858H and A863P mutants. Here, {{there is also a}} notable change in resting membrane potential, being depolarized by 4-7 mV versus wild-type channel expressing cells. The situation is different, however, in sympathetic neurons expressing the L858H mutation. While L858H expressing sympathetic ganglion are depolarized ~5mV relative to wild-type expressing neurons, their threshold for action potential initiation is notably higher. Furthermore, while current injection of 40pA for 950ms provokes an average of 6 action potentials in sympathetic neurons expressing wild-type channels this stimulation evokes only approximately 2 action potentials with reduced overshoots in sympathetic neurons expressing L858H mutant channels. Further investigation has demonstrated that the differences in response between DRG and sympathetic neurons is due to expression of NaV1.8 in the former. Consequently, expression of NaV1.8 channels in sympathetic neurons also expressing L858H mutant NaV1.7 results in neurons with a depolarized resting membrane potential that nevertheless have a normal action potential threshold and overshoot.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} of isolating Schwann cells and subsequently inducing proliferation {{is a large}} obstacle. A solution is to selectively induce cells such as ectomesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) into Schwann cell-like phenotypes. EMSCs are neural crest cells that migrate from the cranical neural crest into the first branchial arch during early development of the peripheral nervous system. EMSCs are multipotent and possess a self-renewing capacity. They {{can be thought of}} as Schwann progenitor cells because they are associated with <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglion</b> and motor nerve development. EMSC differentiation appears to be regulated by intrinsic genetic programs and extracellular signals in the surrounding environment. Schwann cells are the source for both neurotropic and neurotrophic factors essential for regenerating nerves and a scaffold for guiding growth. Nie, Zhang et al. conducted a study investigating the benefits of culturing EMSCs within PLGA conduits. Adding foskolin and BPE to an EMSC culture caused the formation of elongated cell processes, which is common to Schwann cells in vitro. Thus, foskolin and BPF may induce differentiation into Schwann cell-like phenotypes. BPE contains the cytokines GDNF, basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, which cause differentiation and proliferation of glial and Schwann cells by activating MAP kinases. When implanted into the PLGA conduits, the EMSCs maintained long-term survival and promoted peripheral nerve regeneration across a 10mm gap, which usually demonstrates little to no regeneration. Myelinated axons were present within the grafts and basal laminae were formed within the myelin. These observations suggest that EMSCs may promote myelination of regenerated nerve fibers within the conduit.|$|E
500|$|Although Kinesin-5 is {{required}} in all cells during cell division, {{it does not appear}} {{to play a major role}} in the metabolism of most non-dividing cells. [...] Among non-dividing cells, Kinesin-5 is most enriched within neurons, wherein it decorates the large microtubule bundles extending into axons and dendrites. [...] It has been shown, for example, that neurons remain fully viable in the background of a knock-down of Kinesin-5, but that changes in neuronal development and morphogenesis ensue. In developing neurons pharmacological inhibition and siRNA knockdown of KIF11 results in longer axons, more branches, fewer bouts of axon retraction and the inability of growth cones to turn on contact with repulsive substrates. In migratory neurons, inhibition of KIF11 causes neurons to migrate in a random pattern and form shorter leading processes. KIF11, like KIF15 and KIF23, is thought to act as a restrictor of short microtubules moving bi-directionally along the axon, exerting forces antagonistically to cytoplasmic dynein. In mature neurons, KIF11 restricts the movement of short microtubules in dendrites, contributing to the formation of characteristic shape of dendrites. KIF11 is also expressed in adult <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons, although at a much diminished level. In adult neurons It has a similar effect on inhibiting the rate of short microtubule transport so pharmacological inhibition and siRNA knockdown of adult KIF11 may be a potential therapeutic tool for the augmentation of adult axon regeneration. However, a clear in vivo role for Kinesin-5 in neurogenesis remains to be elucidated. [...] Of note is that unusual peripheral neuropathies have not been observed in patients undergoing recent phase I or phase II trials of Kinesin-5 inhibitors for potential anti-cancer therapy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Schwann cells (SCs) play an {{important}} role in the development, function and regeneration of peripheral nerves. They can enhance both peripheral and central nerve regeneration by providing a supportive environment for neurite outgrowth through the release of neurotrophic factors. However, use of primary SCs for in vitro models is limited because these cells are difficult to prepare and maintain in high yield and purity under common cell culture conditions. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression induces immortalization of various cell types without substan-tial alterations of their phenotypes. Therefore, in this study we transfected SCs with hTERT to establish a reliable cell source and observed the effect of hTERT on SCs. In order to accomplish this, SCs were isolated from rat embryo <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglions,</b> transfected with hTERT at early passage (passage 3). SCs passage 4, 8, 12 and 30 after transfection (hTERT-SCs) were used for immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and western blotting. Results showed that all the early (passage 4) and late (passage 30) passage hTERT-SCs expressed hTERT mRNA and gained full telomerase activity. The transfection did not alter the mRNA expression of senescence-associated genes, such as p 53 and p 16. The expression of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) was significantly decreased as cell passage increased, compared to the untransfected control. On the other hand, the expression of NGF (nerve growth factor) was elevated at early passages (passages 4 and 8) and decreased at late passages (12 and 30). These data indicate that the use of specific immortalization techniques can establish SC lines that retain characteristics of typical primary SCs, and different mechanisms responsible for regulating NGF and BDNF expression. This is the first report regarding the immortalization of SCs derived from rat embryo <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglions.</b> These cells are useful in studies investigating the cellular mechanisms and regenerative processes of SCs...|$|R

In {{our previous}} study using Affymetrix arrays, {{it was found}} that after the axotomy of sciatic nerve, there were many novel genes with significant expression changes. Among them, neuronatin (Nnat) was the one which expression was significantly up-regulated. Nnat was identified as a gene selectively expressed in neonatal brains and markedly reduced in adult brains. The present study investigated whether the expression of Nnat correlates with symptoms of neuropathic pain in adult rats with transected sciatic nerve. Methods Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and the Randall and Selitto test were used to study the protein content, and subcellular localization of Nnat in correlation with pain-related animal behavior. Results It was found that after nerve injury, the expression of Nnat was increased in total protein extracts. Unmyelinated C-fiber and thinly myelinated A-δ fiber in adult <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> <b>ganglions</b> (DRGs) were the principal sub-population of primary afferent neurons with distributed Nnat. The increased expression of Nnat and its subcellular localization were related to mechanical hyperalgesia. Conclusions The results indicated that there was significant correlation between mechanical hyperalgesia in axotomy of sciatic nerve and the increased expression of Nnat in C-fiber and A-δ fiber of adult DRG neurons. </p...|$|R
