5|$|Gallagher first sought {{public office}} in 1893, {{when he was}} elected to Edmonton Town Council. In an {{aldermanic}} race in which the top six candidates were elected, he gained the final spot. On his first term on council <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the Licensing, and Health & Relief committees. He was re-elected in 1894, again placing sixth of nine candidates. Once this term expired in 1896, Gallagher stayed out of politics for several months until mayor Herbert Charles Wilson resigned over a dispute involving town funds. It fell to the council to fill the mayor's position. Gallagher was nominated by John Cameron and John Kelly; as there were no rival candidates, he won by acclamation. He was the first mayor of Edmonton never to be elected to that position; (Frederick John Mitchell and Terry Cavanagh would later join him in that distinction). He was sworn in at the town council meeting on October 27, 1896.|$|E
5|$|On 29 May 1773 he {{received}} the office of Great Clerk (Writer) of Lithuania, a relatively low-ranked position that was seen by some as below the magnates of the Potocki family. He participated in the Partition Sejm of 1773, where <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> several commissions. Seeing himself {{in opposition to the}} king, he refused a seat on the Permanent Council that he was offered in March 1774. The king tried to appease him with the Order of Saint Stanislaus on 14 July that year, but that failed to bring Potocki to his side. Instead, Potocki became, for the next decade and half, one of his chief political critics and opponents; on 1776 he went to Moscow to argue, unsuccessfully, for limiting the power of king and the Russian ambassador, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg. Later that year, his election to the Sejm was disputed, and the king and Stackelberg managed to block his election. In 1778 however, the growing rift between the king and Stackelberg allowed him to take, through political maneuvering, the chairmanship of the Permanent Council Marshal of the Sejm. That year he also became a Knight of the Order of the White Eagle.|$|E
