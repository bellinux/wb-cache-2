500|$|When McCartney was a child, {{his mother}} read him poems and {{encouraged}} him to read books. His father invited Paul and his brother Michael to solve crosswords with him, to increase their [...] "word power", as McCartney said. In 2001, McCartney published Blackbird Singing, a volume of poems and lyrics to his songs for which he gave readings in Liverpool and New York City. In the foreword of the book, he explains: [...] "When I was a teenager... I had an overwhelming desire to have a poem published in the school magazine. I wrote something deep and meaningful—which was promptly rejected—and I suppose <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to get my own back ever since". His first children's book was published by Faber & Faber in 2005, , a collaboration with writer Philip Ardagh and animator Geoff Dunbar. Featuring a squirrel whose woodland home is razed by developers, it had been scripted and sketched by McCartney and Dunbar over several years, as an animated film. The Observer labelled it an [...] "anti-capitalist children's book".|$|E
2500|$|I did {{it because}} I had a grudge against him. He {{deserved}} it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to wreak vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of death. I am dying for my country. I have seen my people starving in India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my duty. What a greater honour could be bestowed on me than death {{for the sake of}} my motherland? ...|$|E

2500|$|Nogradi won the Janikovszky-Eva {{award in}} 2003, {{but he has}} never {{received}} any national awards. As he says, [...] "They look at me as an outsider, {{because the people who}} give the awards in our country do not fully understand what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to accomplish with my work and my projects. Fortunately, my readers, the children (and their parents) do, so as long as they love and read my books, I am happy. As a famous Hungarian poet, Sandor Weöres, once said, a writer, if he is any good, must live a sort of life that the powers that be do not even consider him for an award.... I agree." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ericksen {{enrolled}} in University of Washington {{and was able}} to obtain his bachelor's degree in a year due to credits accumulated in his Navy training. He was a mathematics major and had a minor in Naval Science. His first graduate school was Oregon State where he had Howard Eves as an advisor. Ericksen went on to Indiana University seeking to find applications, besides teaching, for his mathematical skill. There he came under the influence of David Gilbarg, Vaclav Hlavaty, Eberhard Hopf, and Max Zorn. Other influences included Bill Gustin, Tracy Thomas, and George Whaples. Most significantly, it was in Bloomington that he began to work with Clifford Truesdell who was criticizing continuum theories. In his autobiography of 2005, Ericksen says [...] "since then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to better understand the formulation of and techniques for exploring continuum theories." [...] Ericksen obtained his Ph.D. in 1951. Jerald and Marion began their family with daughter Lynn in Bloomington.|$|E
2500|$|Gandhi's {{advocacy}} for women's rights began with her help {{in establishing the}} Congress Party's Women's Section. In 1956, she wrote in a letter: [...] "It is because of this that I am taking a much more active part in politics. I {{have to do a}} great deal of touring in order to set up the Congress Party Women's Section, and am on numerous important committees." [...] Gandhi {{spent a great deal of}} time throughout the 1950s helping organize women. She wrote to Norman in 1959, irritable that women had organized around the communist cause but had not mobilized for the Indian cause: [...] "The women, whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to organize for years, had always refused to come into politics. Now they are out in the field." [...] Once appointed president in 1959, she [...] "travelled relentlessly, visiting remote parts of the country that had never before received a VIP...she talked to women, asked about child health and welfare, inquired after the crafts of the region" [...] Gandhi's actions throughout her ascent to power clearly reflect a desire to mobilize women. Gandhi did not see the purpose of feminism. Gandhi saw her own success as a woman, and also noted that [...] "Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] he said, with a {{catch in}} his breath, [...] "you can't mean it, Carrie. In {{spite of what}} you told me, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to believe the thing {{was out of the}} question." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] he said, [...] "but I {{want to hear}} it {{from your}} sister. It is her duty to tell me, and <b>I</b> would not <b>have</b> her think that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to work upon your sympathies to learn her secrets." ...|$|R
60|$|Slowly {{there came}} to me the {{recollection}} of the deferred doom that awaited me since that time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>tried</b> here in the Temple by Zat Arras for the sin of returning from the Valley Dor and the Lost Sea of Korus.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw at last! I {{found out}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> for years which was stronger, God or I; I found out <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> whether <b>I</b> could not do well enough without Him; and there I found that I could not--could not! I felt like a child who had marched off from home, fancying it can find its way, and is lost at once. I {{did not know that}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a Father in heaven who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> looking after me, when I fancied I was looking after myself. I don't half believe it now." [...] . And so the old heart passed away from Thomas Thurnall, and instead of it grew up the heart of a little child.|$|R

"It is true, dear; my name <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{associated}} with the foulest of crimes. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>tried</b> for murdering a woman, and that woman a near relative. I was acquitted, it is true: but simply because the evidence did not amount to what the law required. But {{in the sight of}} the world I went out guilty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] Reuben said quietly. [...] "I {{had never}} {{intended}} to have spoken of it, and I came out to Australia in order that I might be away from everyone who knew the story, but I couldn't accept your offer without your knowing it. I am leaving England because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>tried</b> for burglary." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} we were aware of was the {{presence}} of a body of Sagoths about us. Gruffly they commanded us to follow them. They led us from the arena and back through the streets of Phutra to the audience chamber in which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>tried</b> and sentenced. Here we found ourselves facing the same cold, cruel tribunal.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{something}}," [...] {{he began}} in a low voice, [...] "which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to say ever since we met, something which I think you must have read in my eyes." ...|$|E

60|$|But at {{last the}} allotted moment arrived--the moment for which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to prepare myself, for how long I could not even guess. A great Sagoth came and spoke some words of command to those who watched over me. I was jerked roughly {{to my feet and}} with little {{consideration}} hustled upward toward the higher levels.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, it is discreditable; {{that is to}} say, I {{lie under}} a heavy charge, from which I am unable to clear myself. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>tried</b> for it and found not guilty, but I am sure that if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> before a Scotch jury the verdict would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> not proven, and I left the court acquitted indeed, but a disgraced and ruined man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God {{knows how}} willingly I would heal every wound {{without a word}} {{if it could be}} done.

6000|$|... (II.) <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying,</b> thus far, to {{show you}} what should be the place, and what the power of woman. Now, secondly, we ask, What kind of {{education}} is to fit her for these? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Out!" [...] she said. [...] "Why, it's always out. It seems {{strange to}} me that there should be such a demand for that book. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>trying</b> to get it for ever so long." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This was a {{dangerous}} moment for me. The men had recovered from their fright.
