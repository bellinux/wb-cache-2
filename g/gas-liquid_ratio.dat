40|$|The bubble {{formation}} {{in a square}} microchannel with a converging shape mixing junction has been investigated under gas-liquid Taylor flow using a high-speed camera. A typical bubble formation process was found to consist of two steps including the expansion and rupture steps.

Significant influence of liquid viscosity and two-phase mixture velocity on the bubble length was observed, although a linear dependence of the bubble length on <b>gas-liquid</b> flow <b>ratio</b> is present for a given two-phase mixture velocity or liquid viscosity. This indicates that shear stress {{plays an important role in}} determining the bubble length in the current microfluidic device even at low Capillary numbers where the squeezing regime is expected to predominate.

In this paper, foam flooding with a <b>gas-liquid</b> <b>ratio</b> (GLR) of 0.2 : 1 for the Zhuangxi heavy oil (325 mPa·s at 55 °C) was performed on cores, sand packs and plate model. In sand pack tests, polymer enhanced foam flooding increased oil recovery by 39.8 %, which was 11.4 % higher than that for alkali/surfactant/polymer (ASP) flooding under the same conditions. Polymer enhanced foam flooding in plate models shows that the low GLR foam flooding increased oil recovery by about 30 %, even when the extended water flooding was finished at 90 % water cut. Moreover, it was discovered by microscopy that foam was more stable in heavy oil than in light oil.

40|$|For {{single phase}} flow meters {{more and better}} non-intrusive or even clamp-on meters become available. This allows for a wider use of meters and for easier flow control. As the demand for {{multiphase}} meters is increasing, the current aim {{is to develop a}} non-intrusive multiphase flow meter. The non-intrusive techniques ideally must use simpler technologies used in multiphase flow meters already present on the market. This simplification reduces capital and operation expenditures of the flow meter an end used has to incur. The technology for a multiphase flow meter proposed here, is based on non-intrusive soft-sensing techniques to extract signals generated by a multiphase flow. Outer pipe wall accelerations are measured at different positions by simple non-intrusive accelerometers. The accelerometers generate a signal from which characteristic multiphase flow parameters are extracted. For instance, in case of intermittent flows, slug velocity and slug frequency arc reconstructed. These parameters are subsequently used in semi-empirical models. The models relate the parameters with flow rates of gas and liquid - operation parameters we are looking for. The algorithm for signal processing and analysis results in a good estimation of the liquid and the gas flow rates. In a certain range of 'GVF (gas volume fraction) the estimation results in flow rate measurement at commercially accepted accuracy. An important asset of the described construction of the multiphase flow meter is its simplicity. The simplicity extends applicability of the flow meter which can be used in oil wells, flow lines as well as in process installations.

The separation {{of oil and gas}} mixtures on site may prove expensive and lead to higher infrastructure and maintenance costs as well. A multiphase pump offers a good alternative with a lower capital cost and increased overall production. A Progressive Cavity Pump (PCP) is a positive displacement pump type {{that can be used to}} pump a wide range of multiphase mixtures, including high viscosity fluids with entrained gas and solid particles in suspension. Despite its advantages, a PCP has a reduced ability to handle high <b>gas-liquid</b> <b>ratios</b> due to limitations of its elastomeric stator material required to overcome thermo and mechanical effects. Also the efficiency decreases significantly with increases in gas volume fractions and reduced differential pressures. The current study focuses on studying the behavior of this unique pump in a wide range of GVFs and studying the effect of this ratio on overall efficiency, temperature and pressure distribution on the stator. The pump exhibits vibration issues at specific differential pressures and they have been studied in this work. This can be of critical value as severe vibration issues can damage the pump components such as couplings and bearings leading to high maintenance costs. Another important issue addressed by this research is the behavior of this pump in transient conditions. Oil well production is highly unpredictable with unexpected rises and drops in GVFs. These transient conditions have been simulated by varying the GVF over wide ranges and studying the pump's behavior in terms of load, temperature rises and instantaneous pressure profiles on the pump stator.

40|$|Every {{traditional}} aircraft has a {{shock absorber}} in its main landing gear. A shock absorber takes {{the brunt of}} the shock imparted to the landing gear, absorbs it and dissipates the kinetic energy. This thesis is based on the construction of a realistic analytical model of an oleo-pneumatic shock absorber for a combat aircraft. The governing equations presented here include the effects of friction, gas spring and damping, among other things. The model was validated {{with a wide range of}} reference data, which revealed exceptionally high friction levels detected during the validation process. The reference data consists of measurements from a static test bench, a dynamic test system and an actual aircraft landing, and the corresponding simulations are presented in this thesis. The results of the simulations closely match the measured data. The effects of variations in the <b>gas-liquid</b> <b>ratio</b> and temperature on the pressure behaviour inside the shock absorber were simulated. If the <b>gas-liquid</b> <b>ratio</b> is distorted, the damping ability of the shock absorber is diminished, which may lead to faulty operation of the landing gear. Temperature variation was examined in two ways, firstly by varying the initial temperature and secondly, by heating and cooling the shock absorber. Filling the shock absorber in conditions which differ from the environment in which the aircraft will operate causes the pressure to decrease or increase, depending on whether the shock absorber is cooled or heated. The utilization of simulations as a tool in condition monitoring and fault detection is discussed, and as a result of that a new measuring instrument is proposed, whose design can be facilitated with this simulation model. Although the model presented in this thesis is not complete, it adequately mirrors the behaviour of the gas spring and the metering bin. However, the model does not include the deformations caused by high pressures. A number of possible improvements to the model are presented and discussed. In its present form, the load-stroke behaviour of the model is close to the real shock absorber, and the model can be used to analyse the forces and pressures generated by different shocks. Future work will involve improving the model and incorporation of the model into a larger main landing gear model so that a comprehensive investigation of the dynamics of an aircraft landing can be performed...|$|E

While true for mono-component liquids, multi-component liquids display bubble coalescence inhibition. It is postulated that the hydrodynamic features of a three-phase fluidized bed can be scaled based on geometric similarity and dimensional similitude by matching five dimensionless groups: a liquid Reynolds Number, ReL = ULdPrhoL/micro L; an Archimedes Number, Arp rhoLgdP 3 (rhoL-rhoG) /microL 2; a <b>gas-liquid</b> density <b>ratio,</b> rhoG/rhoL; a particle-liquid density ratio, rhop/rhoL; and a superficial velocity ratio, UG/UL. A bubble coalescence index, I, (1 for mono-component liquids and 2 for multi-component liquids) is an empirical means to account for bubble coalescence inhibition. The effects of pressure and surfactants on the hydrodynamics of three-phase fluidized beds, including the phase holdups, dispersed to coalesced bubbling regime transition velocity and minimum liquid fluidization velocity, are evaluated with water and a 0. 5 %wt aqueous ethanol solution, nitrogen gas, and 2 mm glass beads operated at pressures of 0. 1 to 6 MPa. The effect {{of pressure on the}} bed phase holdups, in particular the gas holdup, is significant and more pronounced at larger gas flow rates where pressure has a greater effect on the equilibrium bubble size.

La vérification théorique et expérimentale de ce principe ainsi que ses limites d'application comme moyen de mesure sont présentées. Ce résultat a été utilisé pour développer un système de mesure de l'aération de l'huile moteur, le SMAC (Système de Mesure d'Aération par Compressibilité). Des exemples d'application, tels que l'étude de la sensibilité de certaines huiles à l'aération, sont exposés. Oil aeration {{can be a}} {{real problem}} in engine oil circuit. The involved lubrication power decrease and thermic properties changes can damage the engine. Furthermore, the increased compressibility is very dangerous for hydraulic systems like valve lash adjusters. A first step to control this aeration {{is to be able to}} measure it. Gammametry is often used but this measurement needs a very precise calibration and is quite complicated and dangerous. A new absolute measurement has been discovered, based on the difference of compressibility between air and oil. It is absolute because the measurement principle is independant of the conditions, The system does not need a new calibration at each new environment. It is valid for any gas-liquid mixture. From the (P, V) graph of a gas-liquid mixture compression, one can derive the <b>gas-liquid</b> volumetric <b>ratio.</b> The log-log graph (P/PO, 1 -V/VO) of a mixture sample pressurization always shows an inflexion point. The y value of this inflexion point (1 -V/VO) is equal to the volumetric gas ratio of the sample (before compression). This phenomenon is obvious on hydraulic curves (see Annexe 1). To check it, we have proceeded to a theoretical demonstration and an experimental verification. The theoretical demonstration of this principle concludes that the principle is verified as long as the ration P index 0 / alpha B is small. B is the oil bulk modulus, alpha is the volumetric gas ratio and P index 0 the sample initial pressure. Numerical simulations indicate that the pressurization must be regular and fast enough to avoid the problems coming from dissolution. They also indicate that small leakage could be profitable by decreasing the maximum pressure needed to meet the inflexion without modifying the measurement. The experimental verification consists in measuring the (P,V) graphs during the pressurization of different known mixture samples. The positions of the inflexion points of the log log graphs were compared with the known volumetric gas ratio. The correlation is very good and the deviations were inside the error range of the preparation of the mixture samples. Based on this principle, a system of oil aeration measurement has been developped : the SMAC (french name for Compressibility based oil Aeration Measurement System). The system is able to take samples from a given circuit by electrovalves. The sample is then regularly pressurized by a piston; pressure, piston displacement and temperature are stored along the time in a PC. The inflexion point is then determined, the gas ratio calculated and printed by a soft on the PC. The whole operation takes around three minutes. This apparatus has been used for two studies. The first one was dealing with hydraulic valve lash adhusters (HLA). The SMAC was measuring the gas ratio of oil in the circuit. The aim was to evaluate the influence of aeration on the HLA. The second study consists in defining a new oil aeration test method to measure the influence of silicone additives on aeration. Generally speaking, the SMAC principle can be used on almost any gas liquid mixture to measure the volumetric gas ration...|$|R
40|$|Converting biomass to useful {{products}} through {{synthesis gas}} (syngas) fermentation {{has the potential}} to replace petroleum based products with biobased ones; however, these process are limited in their application. One of the most significant limiting steps in syngas fermentations is the gas-liquid mass transfer in the bioreactor due to the low solubilities of the major syngas components, CO and H 2. Hence, to explore possible solutions for over coming the gas-liquid mass transfer barrier, a non-traditional external airlift loop reactor is considered. This study evaluates the hydrodynamics and gas-liquid mass transfer rates in an external airlift loop reactor with an area ratio of 1 : 16 operating under different conditions. Two downcomer configurations are investigated consisting of the downcomer vent open or closed to the atmosphere. Experiments for these two configurations are carried out over a range of superficial gas velocities (UG) from UG = 0. 5 to 20 cm/s using three aeration plates with open area ratios of 0. 66, 0. 99 and 2. 22 %. These results are compared to a bubble column operating under similar conditions. Water quality variations are also investigated over the same range of UG with the downcomer open to the atmosphere. Experimental results show that the gas holdup in the riser does not vary significantly with a change in the downcomer configuration or bubble column operation, while a considerable variation is observed in the downcomer gas holdup. Gas holdup in both the riser and downcomer are found to increase with increasing superficial gas velocity. Test results also show that the maximum gas holdup for the three aeration plates is similar, but that the gas holdup trends are different. The superficial liquid velocity is found to vary considerably for the two downcomer configurations. However, for both cases, the superficial liquid velocity {{is a function of the}} superficial gas velocity and/or the flow condition in the downcomer. These observed variations are independent of the aerator plate open area <b>ratio.</b> <b>Gas-liquid</b> mass transfer results indicate that mass transfer rates do vary for oxygen and carbon monoxide gas species. Gas-liquid mass transfer rates are observed to increase linearly with UG in the presence of a surfactant and to increase similarly to riser gas holdup with UG for deionized water and ionic solutions. The gas-liquid mass transfer rates are relatively unaffected by the reactor configuration. The results also show that the addition of a surfactant or ionic compounds has a significant effect on mass transfer, where the surfactant restricts gas-liquid mass transfer and the ionic compounds enhance gas-liquid mass transfer...|$|R
40|$|The {{multiphase}} flow through wellhead restrictions of an offshore oil field in Iran is investigated and {{two sets of}} new correlations are presented for high flow rate and water cut conditions. The both correlations are developed by using 748 actual data points, corresponding to critical flow conditions of gas-liquid mixtures through wellhead chokes. The first set of correlations is a modified Gilbert equation and predicts liquid flow rates {{as a function of}} flowing wellhead pressure, <b>gas-liquid</b> <b>ratio</b> and surface wellhead choke size. To minimize error in such condition, in the second correlation, free water, sediment and emulsion (BS & W) is also considered as an effective parameter. The predicted oil flow rates by the new sets of correlations are in the excellent agreement with the measured ones. These results are found to be statistically superior to those predicted by other relevant published correlations. The both proposed correlations exhibit more accuracy (only 2. 95 % and 2. 0 % average error, respectively) than the existent correlations. These results should encourage the production engineer which works at such condition to utilize the proposed correlations for future practical answers when a lack of available information, time, and calculation capabilities arises...|$|E
30|$|ASP-foam (ASPF) is {{a system}} {{prepared}} by injecting natural gas into the conventional alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP) system. Foam can be formed in the porous media by the interaction of gas and surfactant in the ASP system. With the ASPF system, oil recovery is improved as the interfacial tension (IFT) is reduced to a relatively low level, and the swept volume is enlarged. In this paper, four surfactants were evaluated and characterized by IFT between ASP system and oil and the foaming performance. Alkyl benzene sulfonate (ORS- 41) {{was chosen as the}} surfactant to best reduce IFT between displacement fluids and oil and improve the foaming performance. The mechanisms of ASPF flooding were studied in this paper, the results show that the ASPF flooding not only enlarges the swept volume but also enhances the displacement efficiency. The effects of reservoir heterogeneity, the <b>gas-liquid</b> <b>ratio</b> of ASPF system, and the concentrations of polymer and surfactant on the displacement efficiency were studied. A field trial of ASPF flooding has also been conducted. Both the laboratory results and the field trial results show that the ASPF flooding can significantly increase the oil recovery, with a 30 % increase in the proportion of the original oil in place recovered compared with water flooding.|$|E
30|$|Our {{objective}} here is {{to provide}} a new model for estimating oil flow through wellhead chokes improving upon the Gilbert’s equation and derivatives of it. Based on this formula, the liquid flow rate is as a function of three parameters such as wellhead pressure, choke size, and <b>gas–liquid</b> <b>ratio.</b> Since almost all models available in the literature used these three variables to predict the flow rate, we decided to include a new parameter named basic sediment and water (BS&W) to develop a model with new parameters and better performance. Also, it is necessary to say that the temperature did not have any significant impact on the flow rate based on relevancy factor formula; not including it in the new model (Discussion section). Another novelty is that it uses a mean square error (MSE) function test as the single-objective function for the GA and Solver algorithms, and then applies the optimized formula to a testing data subset, that is evaluated in terms of a set of statistical accuracy and correlation measures. A dataset of 182 wellhead choke measurements from wells drilled in the Reshadat oil field, located offshore southwest of Iran, is used to evaluate models to predict liquid flow rates through wellhead chokes (see Appendices 1, 2 and 3 for details of the reservoir and individual data record values).|$|E
30|$|None of {{the various}} {{published}} models used to predict oil production rates through wellhead chokes from fluid composition and pressures {{can be considered as}} a universal model for all regions. Here, a model is provided to predict liquid production-flow rates for the Reshadat oil field offshore southwest Iran, applying a customized genetic optimization algorithm (GA) and standard Excel Solver non-linear and evolutionary optimization algorithms. The dataset of 182 records of wellhead choke measurements spans liquid flow rates from <[*] 100 to 30, 000 stock tank barrels/day. Each data record includes measurements of five variables: liquid production rate (QL), wellhead pressure, choke size, basic sediment and water, and <b>gas–liquid</b> <b>ratio.</b> 70 % of the dataset (127 data records) was used for training purposes to establish the prediction relationships, and 30 % of the dataset (55 data records) was utilized for independently testing the accuracy of the derived relationships as predictive tools. The methodology applying either the customized GA or standard Solver optimization algorithms, demonstrates significant improvements in QL-prediction accuracy with the lowest APD (−[*] 7.72 to −[*] 2.89), AAPD (7.33 – 8.51), SD (288.77 – 563.85), MSE (91, 871 – 316, 429), and RMSE (303.1 – 562.52); and the highest R 2 (greater than 0.997) compared to six previously published liquid flow-rate prediction models. As a general result, the novel methodology is easily applied to other field/reservoir datasets, to achieve rapid practical flow prediction applications, and is consequently of worldwide significance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Benzyl {{chloride}} is economically one of {{the most}} important starting materials for a large number of industrial syntheses. Far too much money is now spent to buy and import this valuable product. The production of benzyl chloride has been recognized as one of our national projects and budgeted by the National Iranian Petrochemical Organization in order to economize on the country’s foreign exchange. It is certain that obtaining a broad spectrum of scientific information must take priority. A part of this information consists of the kinetics of the reaction, resistance of the used materials, the proper <b>gas-liquid</b> <b>ratio</b> for efficient production, the best range of temperature, etc. Much attention has also been paid to the development of kinetic models, to the design of the reactor, the effects of agitators and inhibitors. The kinetics of thermal chlorination of toluene without catalyst in a semi-batch reactor in a temperature range of 80 - 100 °C and a pressure range of 1 - 3 atm has been investigated. The reactor had an approximate volume of 7 liters. It was equipped with condenser and electric heater and necessary measuring instruments. The reactor was made of SS- 316. Since certain metallic impurities such as iron act as a catalyst for ring chlorination and self-condensation, their presence must be avoided. Consequently, a special resistant lining, PTFE, was used for coating the reactor interior. The rate of initial reactants conversion and the production of benzyl chloride in...|$|E

Mirzaei-Paiaman and Salavati (2013) investigated the effect of gas-specific gravity and oil-specific gravity on liquid flow rate. According to a statistical analysis of their results, they concluded that neither gas-specific gravity nor oil-specific gravity had a significant effect on flow rate. 704 test datasets from 31 wells in field A were used by Al-Ajmi et al. (2015) to develop a model for flow rate through chokes applying an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. Their model resulted in a calculated absolute error for that dataset of 13.92 %. Choubineh et al. (2017 a, b) improved predictions of wellhead choke liquid critical flow rates, applying a model based on a neural network hybridized with a training-learning-based optimization algorithm, to 113 data points from 12 oil wells in south Iran, achieving an average relative error of 2.09 %.
