2500|$|He {{would tell}} stories to {{children}} and spread The New Church gospel to the adults, receiving a floor to sleep on for the night, and sometimes supper, in return. [...] "We can hear him read now, {{just as he did}} that summer day, when we were busy quilting upstairs, and he lay near the door, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> denunciatory and thrillin—strong and loud as the roar of wind and waves, then soft and soothing as the balmy airs that quivered the morning-glory leaves about his gray beard. His was a strange eloquence at times, and he was undoubtedly a man of genius," [...] reported a lady who knew him in his later years.|$|E
60|$|So he went snarling, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> {{higher and}} higher, {{away into the}} kitchen.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you were}} at hand when it befell?" [...] cried Wilding, the scorn in <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> {{superior}} to his agitation and fears for Ruth. [...] "You were at hand, and could neither prevent nor follow him?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Stiffelio preaches {{the gospel}} {{story of the}} woman taken in adultery, which he narrates in recitative. [...] When he is {{suddenly}} moved to forgive Lina, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rises</b> from the narrative chant to his top A on [...] "Perdonata". The congregation echoes him, Lina ecstatically thanks God with her top C, and the curtain falls".|$|R
6000|$|By {{the time}} he gets {{to this part of}} his story we have, at my initiative, left the bridge and are walking towards the Utopian guest house. The Utopian guest house! <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rises</b> and falls, and {{sometimes}} he holds my arm. My attention comes and goes. [...] "Good-night," [...] two sweet-voiced Utopians cry to us in their universal tongue, and I answer them [...] "Good-night." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{was voted}} the 41st most {{influential}} New Zealander by Listener Magazine in 2004. He has a memorable way of talking, not unlike an auctioneer, {{that has caused}} various spoofs of 'The Mad Butcher' that included the Radio Hauraki character 'The Bad Mutcher' on the Morning Pirates and Pulp Sport formerly had a character named 'The Mad Mad Butcher'. In his frequent radio advertisements, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rises</b> to put the major stress and volume on the 99 cents which ends the price of each meat item advertised.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it?" [...] replied Grant, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> {{into a kind}} of splendid chant. [...] "What is it? It is a {{great new}} profession. A great new trade. A trifle immoral, I admit, but still great, like piracy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha, Buster Jack! I struck home there," [...] flashed Wade, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising.</b> [...] "That gives {{your eyes}} the ugly look.... I hate them lyin', bulgin' eyes of yours. An' when my time comes to shoot I'm goin' {{to put them}} both out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They don't {{like the}} way the men keep going overboard," [...] he continued, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> to a tone of {{uncontrolled}} passion. [...] "It is positively absurd, sir, and if you will allow me to say so, the men are far from pleased." ...|$|E
60|$|The Governor's pipe {{dropped to}} the floor. A tear trickled from <b>his</b> eye. <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> had <b>risen,</b> and crumbled to a weakling falsetto, and ceased. He was an old, old man about to be bereft of a son that {{cherished}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... "There may be {{something}} got handsome out of that," [...] said the Captain, not venturing to allow <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> to <b>rise</b> above a whisper. Major Tifto looked hard at him but said nothing. [...] "Of course you must see your way." ...|$|R
60|$|A curious {{quietness}} {{seemed to}} have crept over Mannering. When he answered, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> seemed to <b>rise</b> scarcely above a whisper.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind now," [...] cried Sammy, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> {{above the}} confusion. [...] "I {{will tell you}} all about it. I see what he was up to. He wanted to take {{possession}} of the pole in his own beastly name, most likely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, cousin, I did," [...] he replied, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> a little. There was a {{tinge of}} red in his cheek. [...] "We--you don't need him out at the ranch. We've any numbers of boys. I just told him that--let him down easy--didn't want to bother you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no, Toussac, stop!' {{cried the}} thin man, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> from its soft tones {{to a perfect}} scream as the giant's hairy hand gripped me by the chin once more. 'I appeal to you, Lucien, upon {{practical}} as well as upon moral grounds, not to let this deed be done. Consider that if things should go against us this will cut us off from all hopes of mercy. Consider also--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Open!" [...] {{he cries}} loudly, so loudly that <b>his</b> young, firm <b>voice</b> <b>rises</b> above the tumult around. [...] "Open! {{in the name}} of the Emperor!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's that? Starving them to death? Stuff and nonsense! They {{are getting}} {{all that they}} need, and it's not for you to {{interfere}} in my business," [...] went on Snopper Duke, <b>his</b> high-pitched <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> still higher in anger. [...] "You should be down in your classroom. Give me those things and go downstairs at once. I'll attend to your case later." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>His</b> <b>voice</b> had <b>risen,</b> not so high {{but that}} another {{voice from the}} parlor could prevail over it: a false, silly, girl voice, with the twitter of piano-keys as from hands swept over the whole board to help drown {{the noise of the}} quarrel in the hall. [...] "Oh yes, I'll sing it again, Mr. Saunders, if you sa-a-a-y." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Clara!" [...] {{repeated}} my father, for {{the third}} time, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising,</b> but sinking again immediately--when he spoke his next words, [...] "Clara," [...] he resumed, sadly and gently, [...] "let go his hand; {{this is not a}} time for your presence, I beg you to leave us. You must not take his hand! He has ceased to be my son, or your brother. Clara, do you not hear me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She’s a’ right," [...] said Mr. Boom; [...] "me an’ her ’ve {{just had}} a few words. She picked up {{something}} off the floor {{what she said was}} a cake o’ mud off my heel. Said she wouldn’t have it," [...] continued Mr. Boom, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising.</b> [...] "My own floor too. Swep’ it up off the floor with a dustpan and brush, and held it in front of me to look at." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One, two {{twigs and}} a big branch are broken here," [...] said Mowgli, in an undertone. [...] "Now, how shall I cry THAT? Ah! It is plain now. I, Little Foot, go away making noises and tramplings so that Big Foot may hear me." [...] He {{moved away from the}} rock pace by pace among the trees, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> in the {{distance}} as he approached a little cascade. [...] "I--go, far--away--to--where--the--noise--of--falling-water--covers--my--noise; and--here--I--wait. Cry thy trail, Bagheera, Big Foot!" ...|$|E
25|$|Darrell Eastlake {{is shown}} as an {{over-the-top}} and exuberant personality, which doesn't always {{sit well with}} Richie. Eastlake {{finds it hard to}} contain his own excitement, as <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> will <b>rise</b> to a fever pitch during the announcement of a simple play or event. Despite having virtually no similarities in voice or appearance with Benaud, they are often mistaken for each other.|$|R
6000|$|Pippin {{was leaning}} forward, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> had <b>risen,</b> the words fell like a {{whiplash}} {{on the faces}} of the crowd: [...] "You shan't throw me over; do you think I'll give up all I've done for you? I'll make you the first power in the colony! Are you turning tail at the first shot? You're a set of cowards, my lads!" ...|$|R
60|$|In <b>his</b> <b>rising</b> <b>voice</b> {{a certain}} piquancy {{was left to}} its accent of the ruling class by that faint twang, which came, I remembered, from some slight defect in his tonsils.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, Sir--there's nothing {{surprising}} in it," [...] he returned. [...] "We were school-fellows at Eton, {{in the old}} times. And I have met Geoffrey since, when he was yachting, and when I was with my ship. Geoffrey saved my life, Sir Patrick," [...] he added, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising,</b> and his eyes brightening with honest admiration of his friend. [...] "But for him, I should have been drowned in a boat-accident. Isn't that {{a good reason for}} his being a friend of mine?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{started the}} moment the bowing Mr. Wilks entered the room, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> {{gradually}} from low, bitter tones to a hurricane note which Bella. could hear in the kitchen without even leaving her chair. Mr. Wilks stood dazed and speechless before him, holding the wallflowers {{in one hand and}} his cap in the other. In this attitude he listened to a description of his character drawn with the loving skill of an artist whose whole heart was in his work, and who seemed never tired of filling in details.|$|E
60|$|There {{was also}} an {{interesting}} account how {{a man in a}} boat was distinctly heard by Mr. Green, jun., to exclaim, ‘My eye!’ which Mr. Green, jun., attributed to <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> to the balloon, and the sound being thrown back from its surface into the car; and the whole concluded with a slight allusion to another ascent next Wednesday, all of which was very instructive and very amusing, as our readers will see if they look to the papers. If we have forgotten to mention the date, they have only to wait till next summer, and take the account of the first ascent, and it will answer the purpose equally well.|$|E
6000|$|The work of {{the world}} is to this end, that we eat of the Calf. War and Commerce, Science and Law! what are they but the four pillars {{supporting}} the Golden Calf? He is our God. It is on his back that we have journeyed from the primeval forest, where our ancestors ate nuts and fruit. He is our God. His temple is in every street. His blue-robed priest stands ever at the door, calling to the people to worship. Hark! <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rises</b> on the gas-tainted air--"Now's your time! Now's your time! Buy! Buy! ye people. Bring hither the sweat of your brow, the sweat of your brain, the ache of your heart, buy Veal with it. Bring me the best years of your life. Bring me your thoughts, your hopes, your loves; ye shall have Veal for them. Now's your time! Now's your time! Buy! Buy!" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wadham, Junior, {{cleared his}} throat before continuing. He was a little proud of <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> {{although}} its <b>rise</b> and fall was perhaps more satisfactory {{from the point of}} view of a Chancery Court than from one who expected to gather the sense of every syllable.|$|R
60|$|At {{the sound}} of <b>his</b> <b>voice,</b> the quick <b>rise</b> and fall of her bosom--which {{had been the one}} outward {{betrayal}} thus far of the inner agony that tortured her--suddenly stopped. She stood impenetrably silent, breathlessly still--as if his question had struck her dead, and his pointing hand had petrified her.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he would}} {{suddenly}} {{revert to the}} matter of the food I withheld from him, praying, begging, weeping, at last threatening. He began to raise his voice--I prayed him not to. He perceived a hold on me--he threatened he would shout and bring the Martians upon us. For a time that scared me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of escape beyond estimating. I defied him, although I felt no assurance that he might not do this thing. But that day, at any rate, he did not. He talked with <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> slowly, through the greater part of the eighth and ninth days--threats, entreaties, mingled with a torrent of half-sane and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham of God's service, such as made me pity him. Then he slept awhile, and began again with renewed strength, so loudly that I must needs make him desist.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is far-fetched," [...] he admitted. [...] "When I said it {{was just}} possible--though I didn't claim much for my idea--I said more for it perhaps than it deserved. Dismiss my view as ridiculous; what are you to do next? If Mrs. Beauly is not the poisoner (either by herself or by her maid), who is? She is innocent, and Eustace is innocent. Where is the other person whom you can suspect? Have I {{poisoned}} her?" [...] he cried, with his eyes flashing, and <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> to its highest notes. [...] "Do you, does anybody, suspect Me? I loved her; I adored her; I have never been the same man since her death. Hush! I will trust you with a secret. (Don't tell your husband; {{it might be the}} destruction of our friendship.) I would have married her, before she met with Eustace, if she would have taken me. When the doctors told me she had died poisoned--ask Doctor Jerome what I suffered; he can tell you! All through that horrible night I was awake; watching my opportunity until I found my way to her. I got into the room, and took my last leave of the cold remains of the angel whom I loved. I cried over her. I kissed her. for the first and last time. I stole one little lock of her hair. I have worn it ever since; I have kissed it night and day. Oh, God! the room comes back to me! the dead face comes back to me! Look! look!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{think it}} must have been the riddle that settled us; but the motion and the close air {{likewise}} hurried our departure. We had not been gone long, we heard next morning, ere two or even three out of the five fell sick. We thought it little wonder on the whole, for the sea kept contrary all night. I now made my bed upon the second cabin floor, where, although I ran the risk of being stepped upon, I had a free current of air, more or less vitiated indeed, and running only from steerage to steerage, but at least not stagnant; and from this couch, as well as the usual sounds of a rough night at sea, the hateful coughing and retching of the sick and the sobs of children, I heard a man run wild with terror beseeching his friend for encouragement. [...] "The ship's going down!" [...] he cried with a thrill of agony. [...] "The ship's going down!" [...] he repeated, now in a blank whisper, now with <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> towards a sob; and his friend might reassure him, reason with him, joke at him--all was in vain, and the old cry came back, [...] "The ship's going down!" [...] There was something panic and catching in the emotion of his tones; and I saw in a clear flash what an involved and hideous tragedy was a disaster to an emigrant ship. If this whole parishful of people came no more to land, into how many houses would the newspaper carry woe, and what a great part of the web of our corporate human life would be rent across for ever! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>voice,</b> {{which had}} <b>risen</b> {{even to a}} higher pitch, fell silent. And all at once, without warning, Garvin sank, or rather tumbled upon the bed, sobbing {{in a way that}} was terrible to see. The wife stole across the room, sat down beside him, and laid her hand on his shoulder....|$|R
60|$|I {{thought him}} only awkward and shy, {{for he was}} evidently much embarrassed; and I fancied {{that the best thing}} I could do would be to wait until I saw that he had {{everything}} he wanted and then to leave him to himself. The lunch was soon brought, but it remained for some time on the table. The interview with Mr. Boythorn was a long one, and a stormy one too, I should think, for although his room was at some distance I heard <b>his</b> loud <b>voice</b> <b>rising</b> every now and then like a high wind, and evidently blowing perfect broadsides of denunciation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] {{answered}} the little priest, and <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> seemed to <b>rise</b> {{slightly in the}} roar of the gale. [...] "I mean that the great devil of the universe may be sitting on the top tower of this castle at this moment, as big as a hundred elephants, and roaring like the Apocalypse. There is black magic somewhere at the bottom of this." ...|$|R
