25|$|The game {{of games}} {{in the history of}} the yellow-and-black took place on 15 April 1959, a rainy Wednesday. Sixty-thousand spectators packed into Wankdorf, but the crowd may have {{exceeded}} the official count. After an impressive performance, YB won 1–0 on a Geni Meier goal in the 13th minute. The game was a legend in Bern. Stade de Reims received the Bernese in the return match at the Parc des Princes, Paris, where the Frenchmen won 3–0 to reach the final. No other Swiss team besides FC Zürich has since found as much success in an international competition as Young Boys <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> season.|$|E
500|$|The Progressives {{legal team}} {{argued that the}} {{government}} had not established a case sufficient [...] "to overcome the First Amendment's presumption against prior restraint". The article was based upon information in the public domain, and was therefore neither a threat to national security nor covered by the Atomic Energy Act, which in any case did not authorize prior restraint, or was unconstitutional if it <b>did.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this,</b> counsel relied on the United States v. Heine decision, in which Judge Learned Hand ruled that information in the public domain could not be covered by the Espionage Act of 1917. The government's lawyers argued, on the contrary, that there was sensitive information in the article, which was not in the public domain, and which, if published, would harm arms control efforts.|$|E
500|$|Vincent D'Onofrio's {{character}} in [...] "Subway" [...] partially inspired {{the creation of}} the antagonist played by Bryan Cranston in [...] "Drive", a sixth season episode of The X-Files, which first aired on November 15, 1998. In the episode, Cranston's character is unpleasant and anti-semitic, but he is dying throughout the episode, and screenwriter Vince Gilligan intended for the audience to sympathize with him despite his unlikeable qualities. Gilligan said that this was influenced by [...] "Subway", which he called an [...] "amazing episode". He said of D'Onofio's character: [...] "The brilliant thing they <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> episode, the thing that stuck with me, was this guy's an asshole, the guy really is unpleasant, and yet at the end (you) still feel his humanity." [...] The casting of Cranston in this role directly led Gilligan to eventually cast him as the lead in his television series Breaking Bad.|$|E

500|$|Following his schooling, Crawford won {{a junior}} {{scholarship}} {{to study at}} Keble College, Oxford. There he began reading literae humaniores in 1905 but—after gaining only a third-class score {{in his second year}} exams—he switched courses to study geography in 1908. In 1910 he gained a distinction for his diploma, for which he had conducted a study of the landscape surrounding Andover. Reflecting his interest in the relationship between geography and archaeology, during a walking tour of Ireland he had also written a paper on the geographic distribution of Bronze Age flat bronze axes and beakers in the British Isles. It was presented to the Oxford University Anthropological Society before being published in The Geographical Journal. The archaeologist Grahame Clark later related that the paper [...] "marked a milestone in British Archaeology; it was the first real attempt to deduce prehistoric events from the geographical distribution of archaeological objects". Crawford's fellow archaeologist Mark Bowden stated that while archaeological distribution maps had been previously produced, [...] "archaeological data had never before been married with environmental information" [...] in the way that Crawford <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> article.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} with a C. He criticized Gilmore's {{performance}} in [...] "That Still Small Voice" [...] and earlier episodes, writing that [...] "Gilmore struggles {{to make a}} connection with his character, so it always looks like he’s reading lines," [...] which might {{have a negative effect}} on the Henry's character development. Sava felt that Espenson, based on her previous work, was good at balancing large casts and wrote [...] "this episode juggles the expansive character roster of this series better than its predecessors." [...] Conversely, IGN's Amy Ratcliffe said she has [...] "never liked Henry as much as I <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> episode," [...] especially his explanation to Archie on why he is Jiminy Cricket. Ratcliffe added that Jiminy had the [...] "most touching backstory" [...] of the season up to that point, opining that [...] "the transformation of Dr. Hopper was moving, and this episode maybe felt the most like a fairytale of the stories we've seen so far." [...] She graded [...] "That Still Small Voice" [...] with 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode.|$|E
500|$|In the 1993–94 season, Arsenal contested in the European Cup Winners' Cup, {{having won}} the 1993 FA Cup Final. The club beat Odense BK and Standard Liège {{to reach the}} quarter-finals, with the latter {{described}} as a [...] "breathtaking performance" [...] by Graham, after winning 7–0 at the Stade Maurice Dufrasne. Arsenal defeated Torino of Italy and French representative Paris Saint-Germain to reach the 1994 European Cup Winners' Cup Final alongside Parma, staged at Copenhagen. Without top goalscorer Ian Wright and markers John Jensen and Martin Keown, Arsenal went into the final as outsiders. Although Parma began the match the strongest of both teams, Arsenal opened the scoring through a well taken volley by striker Alan Smith. Defending in numbers, the team held on to record an improbable victory and win the club's second European trophy, after a 24-year wait. After the match Graham praised his team's performance and defended his pragmatic approach; [...] "Sometimes we could go forward {{a little bit more}} and entertain a bit more, but we play to our strengths, like we <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> match. There's nothing wrong with having a very, very good defence, believe me. We've proved it, and it's a big plus." ...|$|E

500|$|November's {{first game}} {{was at the}} Mata Real against Paços de Ferreira. Benfica scored first with a header by Cristian Rodríguez, but Tiago Valente tied the game {{a few minutes later}} for Paços. In the 85th minute, Kostas Katsouranis scored Benefica's winning goal with an assist by Rodríguez. To Camacho, the win was [...] "difficult but very important". On 6 November, Benfica played Celtic on the road. In their second game against the team, Benfica lost 1–0 on a goal by Aiden McGeady. With the loss, Benfica was in last place and needed to defeat Milan to remain in the Champions League. Although Camacho was optimistic, he was aware of the high stakes. On 11 November, Benfica hosted Boavista in search of their fourth {{consecutive}} win in the Primeira Liga. Cardozo scored in the first half, with Boavista tying the score in the 58th minute. Benfica then scored five goals in the final 40 minutes for a 6–1 win. After the match, Rui Costa said, [...] "We had our fourth consecutive win in the Primeira Liga, and I think we are on the right track." [...] After a third international break, Benfica resumed on the 24th with an away game against Académica. Lito scored first for Académica, but a free kick by Rui Costa tied the game. Académica goalkeeper Ricardo made two errors, allowing Luisão and Adu to score Benfica's second and third goals, and Camacho credited the late win to his players' perseverance and commitment. November ended with a decisive match against Milan. Andrea Pirlo scored for Benfica, but Maxi Pereira's 23th-minute shot tied the game. Benfica's fate was determined by events in Glasgow, as Celtic defeated Shakhtar Donetsk with an added-time goal. Camacho bemoaned his team's luck: [...] "We're a bit unhappy. For what we <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> competition I think we should have had more of a chance to go through, so for me football has not been fair to Benfica." ...|$|E

Hinnant, {{who would}} become known as a featured performer on The Electric Company, was cast because he [...] "had such a naturally phony voice", according to Bakshi. Bakshi and Seuling improvised their dialogue as comically inept pig officers; Bakshi enjoyed working as a voice actor and later went on to provide voice roles for some of his other films. Bakshi re-created the voice he <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> film for {{the part of a}} storm trooper in his 1977 animated science fiction film Wizards.|$|E

2500|$|Among two {{or three}} friends, however, the picture of Rivers is quite different.

[...] His insistence on veracity made him a formidable researcher, as Haddon puts it, [...] "the keynote of Rivers was thoroughness. Keenness of thought and precision marked all his work." [...] His research was distinguished by a fidelity {{to the demands of}} experimental method very rare in the realms which he was exploring and, although often overlooked, the work that Rivers <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> early period is of immense import as it formed the foundation of all that came later.|$|E

Girardi said, [...] "This guy, when you look at what he <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> series, he was awesome. He's had a tremendous career, and I'm sure he's going to continue to play, and I don't know what's going to happen."

She was a broken woman, her figure, always plump, became thin and her hands trembling. Although she had been affected by gastric troubles, her death came unexpectedly. [...] Eight days after her sixty-seventh birthday, on 25 October 1920, the only child of Tsar Alexander II to survive the Russian Revolution died in her sleep of a heart attack.

2500|$|Judaism posits a {{creation}} narrative [...] "In the beginning" [...] and a redeemed Olam Haba at the end, which means Judaism has a linear, not a cyclical concept of time, at least regarding the physical world. However, as the Creator is eternal and without beginning or end, things in time attain {{some form of}} eternal-ity through a relationship with Him. Additionally, the Midrash posits that historical events {{in the history of}} the Jewish people repeat themselves. [...] There is a spiritual repetition, too, and the influence is transmitted year after year, no matter the [...] "distance" [...] from the original event. As a result, the actions in a person's life directly affect their life in the next world, or after death, and are direct manifestations of the spiritual influences of what they <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world (see the Kabbalah of the Ariza'l). There is also a perspective that time is composed of seven cycles, which repeat every seven thousand years (a view rejected by Isaac Luria). These concepts give human choices to do good deeds in Olam HaZeh — [...] "this world" [...] - some of what Nietzsche called the eternal recurrence's [...] "infinite weight".|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} again {{arose in}} relation to the incomes of members of the Australian Parliament. In assessing the income of Alfred Deakin and Sir William Lyne, the Victorian Commissioner of Taxes had included their salaries as members of parliament, £233, and as Ministers, £1,650. Deakin lived in Victoria and was the member for Ballaarat. He was also the Attorney-General under then Prime Minister Barton. Lyne lived in New South Wales and was the member for Hume and in 1902 was the Minister for Home Affairs. At the time Parliament sat in Melbourne and so he was required to be in Melbourne whenever Parliament was sitting. [...] Deakin and Lyne objected to the assessment and the Commissioner stated cases for the opinion of the Supreme Court as to whether the assessments were correct to include Commonwealth salaries and this was again referred to the Full Court. The outcome of the case would directly affect the interests of both Barton J and O'Connor J as they were in essentially the same position as Lyne, having previously been members of parliament and living in NSW. The issue would also affect any High Court judge, as the same question would arise when the High Court was sitting in Melbourne, as it <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case.|$|E
