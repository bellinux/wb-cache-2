5|$|Despite those players' {{performance}}s, {{the game}} was decided <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> game {{and the performance of}} the two teams' offensive and defensive lines.

5|$|Given {{the social}} circumstances, {{politically}} oriented social problem films ridiculed politicians and portrayed them as incompetent bumblers, scoundrels, and liars. In The Dark Horse (1932), Warren William is again enlisted, {{this time to}} get an imbecile, who is accidentally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> for Governor, elected. The candidate wins the election despite his incessant, embarrassing mishaps. Washington Merry-Go-Round portrayed the state of a political system stuck in neutral. Columbia Pictures nearly released the film with a scene of the public execution of a politician as the climax before deciding to cut it.|$|E

5|$|In {{the latter}} part of the season, Smith {{increased}} his role and was elevated over Isaiah Williams as the number-two receiver across from Darrius Heyward-Bey.

5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private.
