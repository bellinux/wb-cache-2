40|$|We {{examined}} whether two interpersonal processes, self-disclosure and {{affirmation of}} ideal self, mediated {{the relationship between}} cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> psychological well-being and academic outcomes. We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 484 secondary school children (243 White European, 241 South Asian British; Mage = 11. 10, 220 boys, 264 girls) recruited from 35 multiethnic classrooms. Results of multilevel structural equation modeling revealed mediational effects of self-disclosure between cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> psychological well-being for only South Asian children. Affirmation also mediated the association between cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> both psychological well-being and academic outcomes for South Asian children. For White European children, affirmation mediated the association between cross-ethnic <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> psychological well-being. Further analyses demonstrated that self-disclosure resulting from cross-ethnic friendship quality facilitated affirmation, which in turn promoted both sets of outcomes. Findings demonstrate that cross-ethnic friendships in multiethnic settings contribute to well-being through the generation of positive interpersonal processes. Publisher's Versio...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the methods}} used most often to assess students' <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> <b>friendship</b> {{networks}} is the reciprocal nomination method. However, an often heard complaint is that this technique produces rather negative outcomes. This study compares the reciprocal nomination method with another method to assess students' <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> <b>friendship</b> networks: Social Cognitive Mapping (SCM). The outcomes show that descriptions of students' <b>friendships</b> <b>and</b> <b>friendship</b> networks by both methods tend largely to overlap, even though SCM divides the students into smaller groups. The nomination method indeed yields a slightly more negative picture, labeling more students as "isolates". According to students, {{in most cases the}} group structure of SCM best reflects reality, whereas {{more than half of the}} teachers consider the nomination structure to best fit with reality. It is concluded that the differences between both methods are small, which seems to be primarily based on rather arbitrary decisions in the programs calculating students' scores and group composition...|$|R
