40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{last years}} gave a rise to many {{important}} {{changes in the}} operational status and practical exploitation of satellite navigation systems (SNS) GPS & GLONASS, differential mode of these systems (DGPS, <b>DGLONASS)</b> and Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) as EGNOS or WAAS. Therefore the modernization of these systems as new satellites, new civil signals, new codes, new monitoring stations etc. and the details about new systems under construction as Galileo, Compass and IRNSS, the problem of interoperability and new maritime applications are presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Differential Global Navigation Satellite Systems (DGNSS) such as Differential GPS (DGPS) and GLONASS (<b>DGLONASS)</b> are {{acknowledged}} as global standards for precise positioning and navigation {{and are used}} extensively within dynamic positioning (DP) systems to guide vessels involved in offshore survey and construction operations. Before this, DP vessels would typically use radio-navigation systems provided and operated by a survey-positioning company. These were normally installed {{for the duration of}} a particular contract or project. The survey-positioning company retained full responsibility for the system, which would be used for both survey and DP requirements. The operational straightforwardness of DGNSS has led to its permanent installation and widespread use aboard DP vessels without input from surveyors. This has given vessel operators significant autonomy regarding the positioning of their vessels. When survey services are required on board, the survey contractor is often asked {{to make use of the}} DGNSS system permanently installed on the vessel. Whilst usually convenient this can present potential operational problems relating to the control and performance of the system. There is also potential for contractual disputes to arise in any situation where the survey user and the DP use...|$|E
40|$|The {{high cost}} of {{inertial}} units is the main obstacle for their inclusion in precision navigation systems to support a variety of application areas. Standard inertial navigation systems (INS) use precise gyro and accelerometer sensors; however, newer inertial devices with compact, lower precision sensors have become available in recent years. This group of instruments, called motion sensors, is six to eight times less costly than a standard INS. Given their weak stand-alone accuracy and poor run-to-run stability, such devices are not usable as sole navigation systems. Even the integration of a motion sensor into a navigation system as a supporting device requires the development of non-traditional approaches and algorithms. The objective {{of this paper is}} to assess the feasibility of using a motion sensor, specifically the MotionPakÂ®, integrated with DGPS and <b>DGLONASS</b> information, to provide accurate position and attitude information, and to assess its capability to bridge satellite outages for up to 20 seconds. The motion sensor has three orthogonally mounted 'solid-state ' micro-machined quartz angular rate sensors, and three high performance linear servo accelero-meters mounted in a compact, rugged package. Advanced algorithms are used to integrate the GPS and motion sensor data. These include INS error damping, calculated platfor...|$|E
