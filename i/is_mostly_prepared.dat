It can be further cooked (usually baked), but most often is used without any other preparation. The pâté is served on bread, often with dill or other fresh herbs. Basically the same recipe is known as chopped liver in Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, where schmaltz is used instead of butter and hard-boiled eggs are usually added. Another common type of pâté in Jewish cuisine, also popular in Russia and Ukraine, is vorschmack or gehakte herring (chopped herring).|$|E

Pt <b>is</b> used <b>mostly</b> as a counter electrode as it demonstrates higher efficiencies [38], but the replacement of Pt was much needed due to its higher cost and less abundance. Thus, several alternatives have developed to replace Pt in DSSCs, such as carbon [39], carbonylsulfide (CoS) [40], Au/GNP [15], alloy CEs like FeSe [41], and CoNi 0.25 [42], although {{the different types of}} the CEs are also discussed by Jihuai Wu et al.

25|$|Due to {{the absence}} of {{contemporary}} culinary utensils such as the refrigerator, gas stovetops and ovens, the Indigenous resorted to other means to prepare their food. Upon bringing back hunted game meat, the Aborigines would preserve the meat with either millet wine or salt. Another cooking technique involved the heating up of stones by fire, which are then placed inside a vessel with other certain meats and seafood, which are cooked from the heat of the stones. Foods <b>were</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>prepared</b> by steaming, boiling or roasting, in order to infuse flavours together, yet preserve the original flavours. This again is contrasted with the Han, who adopted skills like stir-frying and stewing. Meat was also put on a bamboo spit and cooked over the fire.|$|R

Such a PLQY of Cs 4 PbBr 6 is significantly {{higher than that of}} other solid forms of lower-dimensional metal halide perovskite derivatives and perovskite nanocrystals. We attribute this dramatic increase in PL to the high exciton binding energy, which we estimate to be ∼ 353 meV, likely induced by the unique Bergerhoff–Schmitz–Dumont-type crystal structure of Cs 4 PbBr 6, in which metal-halide-comprised octahedra are spatially confined. Our findings bring this class of perovskite derivatives to the forefront of color-converting and light-emitting applications...|$|E

In many Asian countries, farmers formulate their own organic formulations by combining different organic materials and treating them by fermentation or composting. For example, in India, panchagavya (PG) {{is one of}} the widely used traditional organic formulations, which <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>prepared</b> by farmers themselves. Panchagavya is a fermented product made from five ingredients obtained from cow, such as milk, urine, dung, curd and clarified butter (Amalraj et al. 2013). South Korean farmers use wild weed wineberry (Rubus phoenicolasius) extract with native microorganisms, which is prepared by mixing wild weed extract, salt, molasses and decomposed leaf soil extract. Thailand farmers use fermented plant extracts or fermented plant juices, which can promote plant growth and act as a biocontrol agent (Kantachote et al. 2009). Bokashi is a Japanese traditional organic formulation preparation which contains effective microorganisms (EM). Japanese first developed the EM concept during 1980 s, and this preparation contains various PGPB and yeast (Yamada and Xu 2001).

40|$|Abstract: The {{increased}} use of composite materials {{has led to an}} increase in demand for facilities to machine them. There are signicant differences between the machining of metals and alloys and that of composite materials, because composites are anisotropic, inhomogeneous and <b>are</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>prepared</b> in laminate form before undergoing the machining process. In most cases, traditional metal cutting tools and techniques are still being used. While the process of metal cutting has been well researched over the years, relatively little research has been carried out on the cutting of composite materials. This paper presents a brief review of research on the cutting of bre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites and medium-density breboard (MDF). Most of the research published is concentrated on the chip formation process and cutting force prediction with unidirectional FRP materials.

The total land inputs including land rent and land tax accumulated to Rs. 50903 /hectare. Among marketing costs the transportation charges were the highest amount of costs. The overall average date palm fruit yield was estimated at 77. 29 maunds per hectare.

The programme does not use other technologies for detection and is not connected to the GPS system. The programme is intended for a long-term use in the vehicle, therefore, the battery autonomy is provided with the appropriate selection of the background colour that covers most of the screen, and with imaging in lower resolution.

40|$|Background: Ghee (clarified butter) {{also known}} as ghrita, has been {{utilized}} {{for thousands of years}} in Ayurveda. Ghee <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>prepared</b> by traditional method in Indian households or by direct cream method at industry level. Ayurvedic classics mention that ghrita made from cow milk is superior. However, there is no scientific comparison available on preparation methods and essential fatty acids content of ghrita. Objective: To investigate fatty acid composition of ghrita prepared by traditional/Ayurvedic method and commercial method (direct cream method). Materials and Methods: Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) extracted from ghrita samples were analysed on Gas Chromatography (GC) Shimadzu B using capillary column BPX 70 (0. 32 mmFNx 0160 m, ID of 0. 25 mm). The fatty acids in the samples were identified by comparing peaks with the external standard 68 A (Nu-Chek-Prep, Inc. USA). Significant differences between the experimental groups were assessed by analysis of variance. Results: Distribution of fatty acids was compared in ghrita samples prepared by traditional method and direct cream method which is commercially used. Saturated fatty acids were predominant in both the groups. Mono unsaturated fatty acids and poly unsaturated fatty acids were in the range of 17 - 18 % and 3 - 6 % respectively. DHA content was significantly higher in ghee prepared by traditional method using curd starter fermentation. Conclusion: The findings suggested that ghrita prepared by traditional ayurvedic methods contains higher amount of DHA; Omega- 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which is a major component of retinal and brain tissues and remains important in prevention of various diseases...|$|E

The prevention of complications which is the main aim {{in the treatment of}} diabetes can be accomplished partly with nutrition education. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the relationship between nutrition knowledge (NK) and complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Materials and Methods: 280 patients with 8 - 20 years of diabetes duration who applied to diet outpatient clinic were recruited. The questionnaire was prepared by the investigators to assess the NK. A score was calculated on the scale of 100. The complications were determined based on hospital records and patients’ selfreport. Results: 63. 2 % of participants were female and 36. 8 % were male. The most common complications in participants were retinopathy (56. 1 %) and neuropathy (42. 9 %). The mean NK score was 80. 2 ± 11. 7. At least one complication was seen in 85. 0 % of the participants. There was no significant difference for having any complication in patients with adequate and inadequate NK. However the risk of diabetic foot, and coronary artery disease was significantly higher in women with inadequate NK. Conclusion: NK is quite high in long term diabetic patients. However no effect of the NK on the development of complications could be shown. The difference of effect between men and women could be due to the fact that food <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>prepared</b> by women thus not much chance of the knowledge of men to be reflected on his eating habits.

We find that micelle formation is very fast and diffusion-limited, occurring on time scales of a few milliseconds. The development of an ordered lyotropic micellar phase is completed within 1 s. The structural transformation into cylindrical micelles occurs over several hours, which subsequently evolve into vesicles over time scales of days. Whereas the first two steps are transport-limited, the two latter processes involve large activation energies related to micellar fusion against the sterically stabilizing micellar coronas, which corresponds to much longer time scales of self-assembly...|$|R
