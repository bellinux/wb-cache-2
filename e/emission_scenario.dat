2500|$|Pteropods {{and brittle}} stars both form {{the base of}} the Arctic food webs and are both seriously damaged from acidification. Pteropods shells {{dissolve}} with increasing acidification and the brittle stars lose muscle mass when re-growing appendages. For pteropods to create shells they require aragonite which is produced through carbonate ions and dissolved calcium. Pteropods are severely affected because increasing acidification levels have steadily decreased the amount of water supersaturated with carbonate which is needed for aragonite creation. Arctic waters are changing so rapidly that they will become undersaturated with aragonite as early as 2016. Additionally the brittle star's eggs die within a few days when exposed to expected conditions resulting from Arctic acidification. Acidification threatens to destroy Arctic food webs from the base up. Arctic food webs are considered simple, meaning there are few steps in the food chain from small organisms to larger predators. For example, pteropods are [...] "a key prey item of a number of higher predators – larger plankton, fish, seabirds, whales". Both pteropods and sea stars serve as a substantial food source and their removal from the simple food web would pose a serious threat to the whole ecosystem. The effects on the calcifying organisms at {{the base of the}} food webs could potentially destroy fisheries. The value of fish caught from US commercial fisheries in 2007 was valued at $3.8billion and of that 73% was derived from calcifiers and their direct predators. Other organisms are directly harmed as a result of acidification. For example, decrease in the growth of marine calcifiers such as the American lobster, ocean quahog, and scallops means there is less shellfish meat available for sale and consumption. Red king crab fisheries are also at a serious threat because crabs are calcifiers and rely on carbonate ions for shell development. Baby red king crab when exposed to increased acidification levels experienced 100% mortality after 95days. In 2006 red king cab accounted for 23% of the total guideline harvest levels and a serious decline in red crab population would threaten the crab harvesting industry. [...] Several ocean goods and services are likely to be undermined by future ocean acidification potentially affecting the livelihoods of some 400 to 800million people depending upon the <b>emission</b> <b>scenario.</b>|$|E

The final result would be an increase of average annual temperature of about 42 °F to close to 48 °F over the southeast region of Alaska.

Based on those readily available datasets, after an extensive model chain evaluation and selection, a correction of systematic biases {{in the daily}} air temperature and precipitation outputs of the RCMs is done. These fields are used to finally drive the hydrological models (mainly HBV). The hydrological model simulation results are used to analyze changes (expressed as scenario bandwidths and tendencies) in average discharge, low-flow and high-flow diagnostics for selected gauging stations along the Rhine and its major tributaries (Basel, Maxau, Worms, Kaub, Cologne, Lobith, Raunheim and Trier).|$|E

The Antarctic ice sheet, however, is expected to grow during the 21st century because of increased precipitation.

In addition to intrinsic uncertainty associated with the natural climate, projections of climate change are subject to the combined uncertainties associated with selection of <b>emissions</b> <b>scenarios,</b> GCM ensembles and downscaling techniques. In particular, unknown future greenhouse gas emissions contribute substantially to the overall uncertainty. We contend that a reduction in uncertainty is possible by refining <b>emissions</b> <b>scenarios.</b> We present a comprehensive review of the growing body of literature that challenges the assumptions underlying the high-growth <b>emissions</b> <b>scenarios</b> (widely used in climate change impact studies), and instead points to a peak and decline in fossil fuel production occurring in the 21 st century. We find that the IPCC's new RCP 4. 5 <b>scenario</b> (low-medium <b>emissions),</b> as well as the B 1 and A 1 T (low <b>emissions)</b> marker <b>scenarios</b> from the IPCC's Special Report on <b>Emissions</b> <b>Scenarios</b> are broadly consistent with the majority of recent fossil fuel production forecasts, whereas the medium to high <b>emissions</b> <b>scenarios</b> generally depend upon unrealistic assumptions of future fossil fuel production.

50|$|As {{indicated}} above, {{the risk}} assessment of biocides in EU hinges {{for a large}} part {{by the development of}} specific <b>emission</b> <b>scenario</b> documents (ESDs) for each product type, which is essential for assessing its exposure of man and the environment. Such ESDs provide detailed scenarios to be used for an initial worse case exposure assessment and for subsequent refinements. ESDs are developed in close collaboration with the OECD Task Force on Biocides and the OECD Exposure Assessment Task Force and are publicly available from websites managed by the Joint Research Centre and OECD (see below). Once ESDs become available they are introduced in the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances (EUSES), an IT tool supporting the implementation of the risk assessment principles set in the Technical Guidance Document for the Risk Assessment of Biocides (TGD). EUSES enables government authorities, research institutes and chemical companies to carry out rapid and efficient assessments of the general risks posed by substances to man and the environment. Once a biocidal active substance is allowed onto the list of approved active substances, its specifications become a reference source of that active substance (so called 'reference active substance'). Thus, when an alternative source of that active substance appears (e.g. from a company that have not participated in the Review Programme of active substances) or when a change appears in the manufacturing location and/or manufacturing process of a reference active substance, then a technical equivalence between these different sources needs to be established with regard to the chemical composition and hazard profile. This is to check if the level of hazard posed to health and environment by the active substance from the secondary source is comparable to the initial assessed active substance.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} year, an {{investigation}} has been initiated regarding how future climate changes may impact the hydrology of the Tijuana River Watershed – a binational watershed. The study has used gridded observed daily precipitation and temperatures and downscaled daily precipitation and temperature projections from three global climate models (GCM) {{to drive the}} VIC macroscale hydrologic model. Sensitivity analysis using VIC suggests about 2 % reduction of runoff for each 1 % reduction in precipitation. A 1 oC increase in average temperature produces about 3 % reduction of runoff. All three GCM simulations yield annual warming, with end-of-century temperature increases from approximately + 1 oC under a lower <b>emission</b> <b>scenario</b> in the less responsive PCM 1 to + 3 oC in a higher <b>emission</b> <b>scenario</b> with the more responsive GFDL model.

Previous projections have broken important new ground, but many rely on out-of-range projections, are limited to the 21 st century, or provide only implicit probabilistic information.

We use this model to derive probabilistic projections of business-as-usual CO 2 emissions to the year 2150.

RCPs have been developed using Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that typically include economic, demographic, energy and simple climate components. Before AR 5, IPCC has been using climate change scenario based on Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) published in 2000 (IPCC Working Group III 2000). In contrast to the AR 4, the climate change from the RCP scenarios in the AR 5 is framed as a combination of adaptation and mitigation (IPCC 2013). They produce a range of responses from ongoing warming, to approximately stabilize forcing, to a stringent mitigation scenario that stabilizes and then slowly reduces the RF after mid- 21 st century. Four RCPs have been used in AR 5 to represent future scenarios. They are RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6 and RCP 8.5. In all RCPs, atmospheric CO 2 concentrations are higher in 2100 relative to present day {{as a result of a}} further increase of cumulative emissions of CO 2 to the atmosphere during the 21 st century.
