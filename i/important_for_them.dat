5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.|$|E
25|$|The {{front row}} {{are usually the}} stockiest members of the scrum. Hookers are {{normally}} smaller than props so they may manoeuvre their lower bodies within the tight confines of the front row and tunnel. Props and locks both need to be strong, but the positions differ in their main criteria for selection. Since props are more directly involved in wrestling for position and channelling the drive forward, strength and weight are of prime importance for them. Strength is also important for locks, since they also push; however, height is more <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> {{than it is for}} front-row players. Locks are virtually always the tallest players on the team; they are used as the primary contestants for possession in another phase of the game, the line-out. Flankers and the number 8 do less of the pushing in the scrum, and need more speed, because their task is to quickly tackle or cover the opposing half-backs if the opposition wins the scrum. Approximately 40% {{of the power of the}} scrum is produced in the front row itself. In most professional teams the forward pack weighs at least 800 kg (1764 lbs).|$|E

500|$|The season's {{first two}} episodes, [...] "Bart of Darkness" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Rival", were held {{over from the}} {{previous}} season, as production was delayed because of the 1994 Northridge earthquake. [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] caused some controversy among the staff with series creator Matt Groening removing his name from the episode's credits {{as he saw it}} as blatant advertising for The Critic, which was airing at the time. The season finale [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" [...] (which aired in two parts, the second acting as the following season's premiere) came from Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, which {{could be used as a}} publicity stunt.

500|$|For {{its fourth}} album, Sleater-Kinney {{wanted to work}} with {{producer}} Roger Moutenot due to his textural work on Yo La Tengo's critically acclaimed 1997album I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One. This marked a change from regular producer John Goodmanson, who had recorded every previous Sleater-Kinney album. As Tucker explained, [...] "These songs warranted a different production, so we looked to other people". The band wanted to expand their sound and challenge themselves in new ways, stating that it was <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> not to make the same record twice. According to Tucker, [...] "We have to keep pushing in order to stay interested in making music together, we want to have longevity as a band". Similarly, drummer Janet Weiss stated that they [...] "wanted the record to sound different than Dig Me Out, to make each song have a real strong personality". The album was written {{over the course of a}} year, which was the longest period the band had spent on making an album. It was recorded at Avast! Recording Company in Seattle, Washington in July 1998.|$|E

500|$|In {{the same}} year, Akhtar {{directed}} Positive, a film produced by Shernaz Italia and Frenzy Kodaiji, starring Boman Irani and Shabana Azmi. It {{was a short}} film running for 12 minutes. Dealing with a family's attitude towards a person suffering from HIV-AIDS, the film was shot in Mumbai and aimed at creating awareness about the problem. It also introduced Arjun Mathur in the film industry. Speaking about {{the purpose of the}} project, Akhtar stated that [...] "Just as a social stigma, many people believe that an HIV patient should be isolated. They also have certain misconceptions about dealing with the disease. And since India has a lot of joint families, it becomes very <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to understand the value of support to the person who has acquired this disease.

2500|$|In the event, Labour {{lost the}} 1959 election, but it voted at its 1960 Conference for {{unilateral}} nuclear disarmament, which represented CND's greatest influence and {{coincided with the}} highest level of public support for its programme. [...] The resolution was passed against the wishes of the party's leaders, who refused to be bound by it and proceeded to organise to have it overturned at the next conference. Hugh Gaitskell, the Labour Party leader, promised to [...] "fight, fight, and fight again" [...] against the decision, which was duly overturned at the 1961 Conference. Labour's failure to win the election and its rejection of unilateralism upset CND's plans, and from about 1961 its prospects of success began to fade. It was said that from that time onward it lacked any clear idea of how nuclear disarmament was to be implemented and that its demonstrations had become ends in themselves. The sociologist Frank Parkin said that, for many supporters, the question of implementation was of secondary importance anyway because, for them, involvement in the campaign was [...] "an expressive activity in which the defence of principles was felt to have higher priority than 'getting things done'." [...] He suggested CND's survival in the face of its failure was {{explained by the fact that}} it provided [...] "a rallying point and symbol for radicals", which was more <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> than [...] "its manifest function of attempting to change the government's nuclear weapons policy." [...] Despite setbacks, it retained the support of a significant minority of the population and became a mass movement, with a network of autonomous branches and specialist groups and an increased participation in demonstrations until about 1963.|$|E

2500|$|Season two {{received}} generally positive reviews but {{was criticized}} by commentators and fans {{for a much}} slower pace, less engaging storyline and lack of focus compared to the first season.

[...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Heroes creator Tim Kring commented on criticisms of season two, and the series' 15% decline in ratings. Kring said that he felt he had made mistakes with the direction of season two. He had thought that the audience was looking for a [...] "build-up of characters and the discovery of their powers", when viewers were instead looking for [...] "adrenaline." [...] Kring also outlined what he felt were problems with plot development, stating that season two [...] "took too long to get to the big-picture story", explaining that Peter's vision of the viral armageddon should have occurred in the first episode instead of the seventh. He feels that it would have been better to introduce new characters within the context of the main storyline, as with Elle, rather than in unattached arcs such as that of Maya and Alejandro. Kring also admitted that he should have resolved the [...] "Hiro in Japan" [...] storyline much more quickly, and that the romantic stories were not working well. With regard to Claire and West, and Hiro and Yaeko, he said, [...] "I've seen more convincing romances on TV. In retrospect, I don't think romance is a natural fit for us." ...|$|E

After leaving the summit level of the lake basin, the road is carried along the slope of a fine forest ravine. The descent is a long one, so that I estimated the village to be not more than 1,500 feet above the sea, yet I found the morning temperature often 69°, the same as at Tondano at least 600 or 700 feet higher. I {{was pleased with the}} appearance of the place, which had a good deal of forest and wild country around it; and found prepared for me a little house consisting only of a verandah and a back room. This was only intended for visitors to rest in, or to pass a night, but it suited me very well. I was so unfortunate, however, as to lose both my hunters just at this time. One had been left at Tondano with fever and diarrhoea, and the other was attacked at Langówan with inflammation of the chest, and as his case looked rather bad I had him sent back to Menado.
