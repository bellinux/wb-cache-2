40|$|AbstractIn industrialized countries, waste {{electrical}} and electronic equipment is mostly processed in shredder-based processes, which {{are characterized by}} a low recovery of precious metals, rare earth elements and flame retardant plastics. To increase the recycling efficiency for these materials, a <b>dismantling</b> <b>tool</b> has been developed. The development process of the <b>dismantling</b> <b>tool</b> was guided by in-depth analysis of the required disassembly time for LCD TVs and laptops. The results of practical experiments demonstrate that the use of the <b>dismantling</b> <b>tool</b> enable to reduce the dismantling time for plastic housing components and PWBs with respectively 36 % and 45 % for LCD TVs...|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{tribute to}} the Hs 123 usefulness came in January 1943 when Generaloberst Wolfram von Richthofen, then commander-in-chief of Luftflotte 4, asked whether production of the Hs 123 could be restarted because the Hs 123 performed well in a theater where mud, snow, rain and ice took a heavy toll on the serviceability of more advanced aircraft. However, the Henschel factory had already <b>dismantled</b> all <b>tools</b> and jigs in 1940.|$|R
40|$|Decommissioning of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant {{involves}} multiple problems. One {{of them is}} personnel {{radiation safety}} during the performance of dismantling activities. In this paper, modeling results of radiation doses during {{the dismantling of the}} pressurized tank from the emergency core cooling system (ECCS PT) of RBMK- 1500 reactor are presented. The radiological surveys indicate that the inner surface of the ECCS PT is contaminated with radioactive products of corrosion and sediments due to the radioactive water. The effective doses to the workers have been modeled for different strategies of ECCS PT dismantling. In order to select the optimal personnel radiation safety, the modeling has been performed by the means of computer code “VISIPLAN 3 D ALARA Planning tool” developed by SCK CEN (Belgium). The impacts of <b>dismantling</b> <b>tools,</b> shielding types, and extract ventilation flow rate on effective doses during the dismantling of ECCS PT have been analyzed. The total effective personnel doses have been obtained by summarizing the effective personnel doses from various sources of exposure, that is, direct radiation from radioactive equipment, internal radiation due to inhalation of radioactive aerosols, and direct radiation from radioactive aerosols arising during hot cutting in premises. The uncertainty of the collective doses is also presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out with a Nd-YAG laser as a future <b>dismantling</b> cutting <b>tool.</b> At the beginning, industrial lasers could cut only small thicknesses due their small power (1 kW) but now, with the rise in industrial power (8 kW), it is possible to cut plates up to 100 mm thickness. This technique is practical with the use of optical fibers which allow to maintain the laser generator in a non-radioactive zone. This paper provides a synthesis of the measurements of aerosols and gases produced in different configurations (cutting in air and underwater) and some comparisons with other cutting tools...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{dismantling}} techniques {{used in a}} Decontamination and Dismantlement (D and D) project are taken from conventional demolition practices. Some modifications to the techniques are made to limit exposure to the workers or to lessen the spread of contamination to the work area. When working on a D and D project, {{it is best to}} keep the <b>dismantling</b> techniques and <b>tools</b> as simple as possible. The workers will be more efficient and safer using techniques that are familiar to them. Prior experience with the technique or use of mock-ups {{is the best way to}} keep workers safe and to keep the project on schedule...|$|R
40|$|This Note {{investigates the}} wisdom and {{validity}} of 40 CER. § 124. 55 (b), a Clean Water Act regulation promulgated by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{as part of the}} National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program. The Clean Water Act provides affected states with an opportunity to certify federally administered NDES permits before issuance by EPA. State certification is a meaningful moment in water quality regulation, and judicial review of these critical decisions takes place in state courts. Unfortunately, 40 C. ER. § 124. 55 (b), designed to bring certainty and finality to permit-holders, effectively removes state courts from the process of ensuring that state certifications are legally sufficient after permit issuance. In doing so, the regulation <b>dismantles</b> an essential <b>tool</b> of the Clean Water Act. It also renders 40 CER. § 124. 55 (b) invalid. Thus, 40 C. ER. § 124. 55 (b) should be repealed by EPA or invalidated by the courts, so that environmental organizations can effectively challenge illegal state certifications. While significant legal obstacles-standing, jurisdiction, and statutes of limitations, to name a few-stand {{in the way of a}} challenge to the validity to 40 CER. § 124. 55 (b), there is a good chance that such a challenge could ultimately find success...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{studies on}} four makes of Japanese automobiles, three 1981 and one 1982 model years, received from three manufacturers {{to determine if}} their materials composition would present problems to the current technology used to process junk automobiles for metal recovery. One of each make of automobile was hand-dismantled to determine the materials composition. In addition, two nearly identical automobiles of each make were shredded at a commercial operation where all metal products and rejects were collected for analysis to determine metal and nonmetal distribution. The average weight of the four automobiles to be <b>dismantled,</b> less batteries, <b>tools,</b> and fluids, was 1, 938. 3 lb. The weight was distributed as 1, 472. 9 lb. ferrous and 115. 6 lb nonferrous metals, 275. 2 lb combustibles, 72. 3 lb noncombustibles, and 2. 3 lb electrical components. The dismantled automobiles, less gas tanks, fluids, tools, wheels, tires, and batteries, which were all removed from the automobiles that were shredded, contained an average of 1, 389. 1 lb ferrous and 101. 6 lb nonferrous metals, 305. 7 lb nonmetals, and 2. 3 lb electrical components. In comparison, materials collected from the shredded automobiles averaged 1, 304 lb ferrous metals, 80 lb nonferrous metals, and 341 lb landfill materials. There were no materials used {{in the manufacture of}} the late model Japanese automobiles that should present handling or processing problems to the steelmaking or secondary metal recyclers...|$|R
