5|$|The idea {{going in}} was to <b>juxtapose</b> my singing style with a {{hardcore}} hip-hop sensibility {{and have the}} finished product still sound like a Madonna record. I began the process by meeting with the hip-hop producers whose work I most admired. It was important, if I were to {{use a variety of}} collaborators, that the end product sound cohesive and thematically whole. I wasn't interested in the variety pack approach.|$|E
5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to <b>juxtapose</b> the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E

50|$|When declaring {{identity}} of two elements, Duna has {{no need of}} a copula. Two noun phrases can simply be <b>juxtaposed</b> to indicate identity or a similarity relation. The same goes for adjectival predicates: <b>juxtaposing</b> subject and adjective results in property attribution.|$|R
50|$|The {{three most}} common means of joining clauses are sentence-sequence (<b>juxtaposed</b> clauses that have {{separate}} intonation contours), coordination (<b>juxtaposed</b> clauses with one intonation contour and sharing of conjugational {{categories such as}} tense) and subordination.

5|$|For many, the Vatican's actions {{encapsulated}} {{all that}} {{was wrong with the}} Papal States and exposed pontifical rule as an anachronism. Several historians highlight the affair {{as one of the most}} significant events of Pius IX's papacy, and <b>juxtapose</b> his handling of it in 1858 with the loss of most of his territory a year later. The case notably altered the policy of the French Emperor Napoleon III, who shifted from opposing the movement for Italian unification to actively supporting it. The traditional Italian historiography of unification does not give much prominence to the Mortara case, which by the late 20th century was remembered mostly by Jewish scholars, but a 1997 study by the American historian David Kertzer has marked the start of a wider re-examination.|$|E

25|$|Man Ray was {{represented}} in the first Surrealist exhibition with Jean Arp, Max Ernst, André Masson, Joan Miró, and Pablo Picasso at the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. Important works from this time were a metronome with an eye, originally titled Object to Be Destroyed, and the Violon d'Ingres, a stunning photograph of Kiki de Montparnasse, styled after the painter/musician Ingres. Violon d'Ingres is a popular example of how Man Ray could <b>juxtapose</b> disparate elements in his photography to generate meaning.|$|E

50|$|The shot/reverse shot {{function}} of split screen comprises {{most of the}} running time of the film, but the filmmakers also use split screen for other spatial, temporal and emotional effects. Conversations split screen sometimes shows flashbacks of the recent or distant past <b>juxtaposed</b> with the present; moments imagined or hoped by the characters <b>juxtaposed</b> with present reality; present experience fractured into more than one emotion for a given line or action, showing an actor performing the same moment in different ways; and present and near future actions <b>juxtaposed</b> to accelerate the narrative in temporal overlap.|$|R

25|$|A tesseract is in {{principle}} obtained by combining two cubes. The scheme {{is similar to}} the construction of a cube from two squares: <b>juxtapose</b> two copies of the lower-dimensional cube and connect the corresponding vertices. Each edge of a tesseract is of the same length. This view is of interest when using tesseracts as the basis for a network topology to link multiple processors in parallel computing: the distance between two nodes is at most 4 and there are many different paths to allow weight balancing.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} to have critical success with scores to such films as the 1976 dystopian science fiction Logan's Run, the 1977 period drama Islands in the Stream (which remained one of his personal favorites), the 1978 science fiction suspense Coma, the 1978 science fiction thriller Capricorn One, the 1978 disaster film The Swarm, the 1979 period comedy The Great Train Robbery, and his Academy Award-nominated score to the 1978 science fiction thriller The Boys from Brazil, in which he utilized lively waltzes to <b>juxtapose</b> the film's horrific concept, cloning Adolf Hitler.|$|E
25|$|Yamaguchi {{intentionally}} {{tried to}} create uncool and old-fashioned lyrics, in order to <b>juxtapose</b> with the song's modern sound. He wrote the lyrics an hommage to kayōkyoku pop lyrics of the 1970s and 1980s, specifically the songs of Momoe Yamaguchi and Akina Nakamori. Yamaguchi felt that stylistically, the song's chorus melody was directly inspired by Shōwa period kayōkyoku, but someone unfamiliar with the genre might misinterpret as purely inspired by dance music. After Yamaguchi finished songwriting, the band's guitarist Motoharu Iwadera arranged the initial demo, with bassist Ami Kusakari later reworking the demo to blend Iwadera's style with hers.|$|E

25|$|Each {{suite of}} Musikalische Ergötzung {{begins with an}} {{introductory}} Sonata or Sonatina in one movement. In suites 1 and 3 these introductory movements are Allegro three-voice fughettas and stretti. The other four sonatas are reminiscent of French overtures. They have two Adagio sections which <b>juxtapose</b> slower and faster rhythms: the first section uses patterns of dotted quarter and eighth notes in a non-imitative manner. The second employs the violins in an imitative, sometimes homophonic structure, that uses shorter note values. The dance movements of the suites show traces of Italian (in the gigues of suites 2 and 6) and German (allemande appears in suites 1 and 2) influence, {{but the majority of}} the movements are clearly influenced by the French style. The suites do not adhere to a fixed structure: the allemande is only present in two suites, the gigues in four, two suites end with a chaconne, and the fourth suite contains two arias.|$|E
25|$|Hudson River School {{paintings}} {{reflect the}} themes of discovery, exploration, and settlement in America in the 19th century. The detailed and idealized paintings also typically depict a pastoral setting. The works often <b>juxtapose</b> peaceful agriculture and the remaining wilderness, which was fast disappearing from the Hudson Valley {{just as it was}} coming to be appreciated for its qualities of ruggedness and sublimity. The school characterizes the artistic body, its New York location, its landscape subject matter, and often its subject, the Hudson River. In general, Hudson River School artists believed that nature {{in the form of the}} American landscape was an ineffable manifestation of God, though the artists varied in the depth of their religious conviction. Their reverence for America's natural beauty was shared with contemporary American writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The artist Thomas Cole is generally acknowledged as the founder of the Hudson River School, while painters Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt were the most successful painters of the school.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} aspects of the complex is its murals and other decorative features. There are both monochromatic and polychromatic murals, with monochromatic dominating. The murals contain Biblical and other religious scenes which show some interesting localized modifications, starting with the use of monochrome paintings. Elements of imagery and symbols from Mixtec and Zapotec religious and cultural traditions can be found in both the murals and in some of the architectural elements. The purpose of the blend was to <b>juxtapose</b> the spiritual traditions of Mesoamerica and the Iberian Peninsula. The idea was to make conversion easier for the indigenous people by allowing them to recognize similarities and compatibilities between the old and new religions so that there would be gradual conversion and acculturalation. The most obvious of this is the large atrium, which mimics a teocalli or sacred precinct. A mural of the crucifixion {{on the wall of the}} sacristy of the basilica has scenery with references to the geographical features of Cuilapan. The monochromatic scenes in the processional corridors contain allusion to the religious practices and cosmogonies of the Mixtecs.|$|E

Two examples of this procedure, from the opening movement of the B-flat Sonata, are shown on the right.|$|E

500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American rock band Blink-182 for their eponymously titled fifth studio album (2003). The song was released as the lead single from Blink-182 on October 2, 2003 through Geffen Records. It was written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus, and drummer Travis Barker, and was produced and mixed by Jerry Finn. The song originated {{on the first day}} of producing the album. Its lyrics are purely sexual in nature; the band attempted to <b>juxtapose</b> lust and passion between verses and choruses, thematically connected with a wistful, regretful tone.|$|E
