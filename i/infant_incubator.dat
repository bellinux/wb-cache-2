In neonatal intensive care units (NICU), <b>infant</b> <b>incubators</b> are the places where premature babies are nurtured for their complete development.

Several ANC algorithms are evaluated for the complicated problem of noises generated from different sources {{both inside and outside the}} incubator. A multiplechannel hybrid ANC system is developed effectively to cancel both inside and outside incubator noises.

The ANC system for the <b>infant</b> <b>incubators</b> is further enhanced by integrating a cry detection algorithm.

40|$|Summary: The authors {{compared}} axillary skin temperatures (AT) {{measured with}} an infrared (IR) thermometer (Lightouch Neonate, Exergen Corp) with rectal temperatures (RT) in 16 newly born term infants under radiant warmers (RW) and in cribs. Twelve stable, growing premature <b>infants</b> in <b>incubators</b> were also studied. This new device {{may be useful}} because of safety and rapid results (1 second), but clinical accuracy is unknown. For term infants, mean (SD) RT-AT difference was 0. 1 (0. 48) 0 C under RW and 0. 25 (0. 17) 0 C 2 hours later in cribs. For premature <b>infants</b> in <b>incubators</b> the mean RT-AT difference was 0. 09 (0. 16) °C.

5000|$|Tarnier {{is remembered}} {{for his work}} {{involving}} the perinatal aspects of obstetrics, and in particular, the treatment and well-being of premature infants. In the 1870s he realized that keeping a constant temperature was not sufficient for a premature infant's survival. He believed that isolation, hygiene, appropriate feeding, and a warm, humid environment were also necessary. Inspired by a device used to incubate poultry, Tarnier introduced prototypes of <b>infant</b> <b>incubators</b> to the Paris Maternité in 1881. These devices were basically wooden boxes with glass lids and compartments that contained hot-water bottles. He called his [...] "baby-warming device" [...] a [...] "couveuse", [...] and through it Tarnier was responsible for a 28% decrease in infant mortality {{over a three-year period}} at the Paris Maternité.|$|R

The healthcare application is further enhanced by integrating the “womb effect”, that is, by using intrauterine and maternal heart sounds, proven to be beneficial to infant health, for soothing the infant and masking the residual noise. A computer model for audio-integrated noise cancellation utilizing experimentally measured transfer functions is developed for simulations using real medical equipment noise.

50|$|While high infant {{mortality}} rates were {{recognized by the}} British medical community at least {{as early as the}} 1860s, modern neonatal intensive care is a relatively recent advance. In 1898 Dr. Joseph DeLee established the first premature <b>infant</b> <b>incubator</b> station in Chicago, Illinois. The first American textbook on prematurity was published in 1922. In 1952 Dr. Virginia Apgar described the Apgar score scoring system as a means of evaluating a newborn's condition.

5000|$|<b>Infant</b> <b>Incubator</b> - Although infant {{incubators}} {{were invented}} {{in the year}} 1888 by Drs. Alan M. Thomas and William Champion, these devices were not immediately widely used. To increase awareness of the benefits these units provided, infant incubators containing premature babies were displayed at the 1897, 1898, 1901, and 1904 World Fairs. This piece of medical equipment helped neonates with compromised immune systems by providing a sanitary environment to {{reduce the likelihood of}} acquiring an infection. Each incubator was an air-tight glass box with a metal frame. Hot air was pumped into the container to keep a constant temperature. Newspapers advertised the incubators with [...] "lives are being preserved by this wonderful method." [...] During the World Fair in 1904, E. M. Bayliss brought these devices for exhibition on The Pike where approximately ten nurses cared for twenty-four neo-natal babies while in the infant incubators. The exhibit required an entrance fee of twenty-five cents and visitors could also purchase souvenirs and refreshments from the adjoining shop and café. These proceeds, totaling $181,632, helped to fund Bayliss's project. There were some setbacks with the <b>infant</b> <b>incubator</b> display as the sanitary conditions were not always consistent and some babies died of illness. The incubator area was then modified by installing glass walls to separate the babies from visitors, thus decreasing the exposure of the infants. The science and technology behind the incubators has since been expanded upon. Now known as [...] "isolettes," [...] these units are a vital component to caring for neonates in modern neonatal intensive care units.|$|E

Objetivos: Avaliar incubadoras e comparar conhecimentos e práticas de manuseio entre enfermeiros e técnicos/auxiliares de enfermagem. Método: Estudo transversal, quantitativo, realizado em unidade neonatal de um hospital de referência. A avaliação da estrutura física das incubadoras foi realizada por check-list e analisada por estatística descritiva. Aplicou-se questionário e foi realizada observação direta envolvendo o manuseio das incubadoras pelos profissionais, considerando-se p< 0, 05 para o nível de significância estatística ao compará-los. Resultados: Detectaram-se inúmeros defeitos nas incubadoras. Técnicos/auxiliares de enfermagem mais frequentemente receberam treinamento ao ingressarem na unidade e sentiam-se aptos para manusearem incubadoras. Práticas adequadas de manuseio tiveram proporções semelhantes entre os profissionais. Conclusões: Identificaram-se problemas físicos nas incubadoras, dúvidas e práticas inadequadas pelos profissionais.
