40|$|A {{computationally}} efficient {{method is}} developed {{in this paper}} for deriving a sequence of bounds to the global value of an in~eger fixed charge problem where certain functions are linear only for positive values of the argument and have a jump discontinuity at the origin. While other efficient approximate techniques are available, the technique developed here offers the additional advantage of permitting the sequential error inherent in approximate solutions to be determined. By adapting Bolinski’s [I]?!aI,proximate method Of 9 f 31 ution” for the fixed cost transportation problem, initial bounds are derived to the global value of fixed <b>charge</b> <b>plant</b> location problem. Then, a sequence of problems are defined which are theorematically shown to be finite.

40|$|Eight {{surrogate}} spaceflight mission specialists {{participated in}} a real-time evaluation of remote coaching using the Ames Life Science Telescience Testbed facility.

The major objective of this project was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of telescience techniques and hardware to support three realistic remote coaching science procedures: <b>plant</b> seed germinator <b>charging,</b> <b>plant</b> sample acquisition and preservation, and remote plant observation with ground coaching. Each scenario was performed by a subject acting as flight mission specialist, interacting with a payload operations manager and a principal investigator expert. All three groups were physically isolated from each other yet linked by duplex audio and color video communication channels and networked computer workstations. Workload ratings were made by the flight and ground crewpersons immediately after completing their assigned tasks. Time to complete each scientific procedural step was recorded automatically. Two expert observers also made performance ratings and various error assessments. The results are presented and discussed...|$|R
