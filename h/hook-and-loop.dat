25|$|On model railroads {{couplers}} {{vary according}} to scale, and have evolved over many years. Early model trains were coupled using various <b>hook-and-loop</b> arrangements, which were frequently asymmetrical, requiring all cars to be pointing in the same direction. In the larger scales, working scale or near-scale models of Janney couplers were quite common, but proved impractical in HO and smaller scales.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2004, some U.S. Army {{soldiers}} in Iraq were issued the [...] "Close Combat Uniform" [...] {{a variant of}} the Desert Camouflage Uniform (DCU) that featured new innovations such as shoulder pockets affixed with <b>hook-and-loop</b> [...] "Velcro" [...] fasteners, chest-worn rank insignia, and a new collar. The experimental features used on the CCU were eventually incorporated into the ACU, which was announced to the public in June 2004.|$|E

These jackets were previously adorned with various [...] "mission patches," [...] which indicate places the wearer has served. Today, patches on the G-1 {{are limited to}} a maximum of three in addition to the nametag, i.e., a unit insignia on the right breast, an aircraft type insignia on the right sleeve and an aircraft type insignia or embroidered U.S. flag on the left sleeve.|$|E
2500|$|Trademark owners {{may take}} various steps {{to reduce the}} risk, {{including}} educating businesses and consumers on appropriate trademark use, avoiding use of their marks in a generic manner, and systematically and effectively enforcing their trademark rights. If a trademark {{is associated with a}} new invention, the trademark owner may also consider developing a generic term for the product to be used in descriptive contexts, to avoid inappropriate use of the [...] "house" [...] mark. [...] Such a term is called a generic descriptor, and is frequently used immediately after the trademark to provide a description of the product or service. [...] For example, [...] "Kleenex tissues" [...] ("facial tissues" [...] being the generic descriptor) or [...] "Velcro brand fasteners" [...] for Velcro brand name <b>hook-and-loop</b> fasteners.|$|E
2500|$|The current {{version of}} the Centennial shirt is a khaki (officially {{referred}} by BSA as tan) button-front shirt with collar, bellowed pockets on the chest and closed with <b>hook-and-loop</b> closures, and shoulder epaulets with shoulder loops in {{the color of the}} individual's registration (see above). All adults and youth males wear forest green or khaki convertible or Switchback zip-off cargo pants, which easily convert to knee-length cargo shorts with the pull of a zipper. Socks, worn with the uniform, are also forest green and have a black [...] "B.S.A." [...] monogrammed at the top and are available in crew and ankle lengths. The new official belt is a forest green rigger style belt with a black metal mechanical claw buckle– other belt styles, mostly in tan or brown leather, are also worn, while the hat, resembling the U.S. Army's baseball-style fatigue hat worn during the Vietnam War-era, is also in forest green with the B.S.A. emblem embroidered in the front in a ghost stitching.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, {{the medical}} bag {{was made of}} leather, opened on the top with a split-handle design. During the American Civil War, physician's medical saddle bags were used.

5000|$|The vest is donned {{and removed}} using a hook-and-pile [...] "cummerbund," [...] which fastens around the waist, and a buckle atop each shoulder.

Other possible features include collars, shoulder straps and hoods.Persians were the first people who made coats.|$|E
50|$|With {{the modern}} {{development}} of synthetic shipping boots made with <b>hook-and-loop</b> fasteners, most people choose this option {{as they are}} quicker to apply. A poorly applied shipping bandage is {{also more likely to}} fall off than a shipping boot.

50|$|Although the tensile {{strength}} {{is similar to}} Kevlar, Vectran still tends to experience tensile fractures when exposed to significant stress. The wispy, hair-like fibers tend to fray, to easily acquire dirt, and to readily entangle in <b>hook-and-loop</b> fasteners, from which they must sometimes then be cut or (when possible) torn.If used without protective coatings, Vectran has low resistance to UV degradation.|$|E

50|$|Take-n-Play Thomas & Friends (formerly Take Along Thomas & Friends) is {{a series}} of {{die-cast}} 'Thomas' models made by Learning Curve and designed for preschool children. The models have superseded the Ertl die-cast models range, which has now been discontinued. The two ranges are incompatible as the new models use special 'two-way' magnets instead of the <b>hook-and-loop</b> couplers provided on the Ertl models.|$|E
50|$|Because its ease of use, <b>hook-and-loop</b> {{fasteners}} {{have been}} used {{for a wide variety of}} applications where a temporary bond is required. It is especially popular in clothing where it replaces buttons or zippers, and as a shoe fastener for children who have not yet learned to tie shoelaces. Touch fasteners are used in adaptive clothing, which is designed for people with physical disabilities, the elderly, and the infirm, who may experience difficulty dressing themselves due to an inability to manipulate closures such as buttons and zippers.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{physical}} nature of playing rugby, several variants have been created to introduce the sport to children with a reduced level of physical contact. Of these versions, Touch rugby, in which [...] "tackles" [...] are made by simply touching the ball carrier with two hands, is popular as a mixed sex version of the sport played by both children and adults. Tag Rugby, is a version in which the participants wear a belt with two <b>hook-and-loop</b> fastener tags, the removal of either counting as a 'tackle'. Tag Rugby also varies {{in the fact that}} kicking the ball is not allowed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hook-and-loop</b> {{fasteners}}, hook-and-pile fasteners or touch fasteners, {{commonly known}} as [...] "velcro", consist of two components: typically, two lineal fabric strips (or, alternatively, round [...] "dots" [...] or squares) which are attached (sewn or otherwise adhered) to the opposing surfaces to be fastened. The first component features tiny hooks; the second features even smaller and [...] "hairier" [...] loops. When the two components are pressed together, the hooks catch in the loops and the two pieces fasten or bind temporarily {{during the time that}} they are pressed together. When separated, by pulling or peeling the two surfaces apart, the strips make a distinctive [...] "ripping" [...] sound.|$|E

50|$|A bolster {{is a long}} narrow pillow or cushion {{filled with}} cotton, down or fibre. Bolsters are usually firm for back or arm support or for {{decorative}} application. They are not a standard size or shape and commonly have a zipper or <b>hook-and-loop</b> enclosure. A foam insert is sometimes used for additional support. A bolster is {{also referred to as}} a cushion, a pillow and a prop. In western countries, a bolster is usually placed at the head of one's bed and functions as head or lower back support, or as an arm support on furniture with high rigid sides. Bolster pillows are also used as bumpers in cribs and for lounging on the floor in family and children's rooms.|$|E

50|$|The Airman Battle Uniform {{is similar}} to the Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP) in color, with the {{inclusion}} of slate blue, but is otherwise nearly identical to the BDU layout. The ABU is to be worn with low-maintenance sage green suede combat boots. The ABU does not have features of the U.S. Army ACU, such as tilted/slanted pockets, sleeve pockets, <b>hook-and-loop</b> attachment points and closures, gusseted back, mandarin collar, etc. However, the ABU does have essential NIR (near-infra red) qualities. The sleeves are authorized to be rolled up. The heavy weight of the material, along with the multiple layers used to make the interior pockets, retains more heat than the ACU or BDU in hot climates such as the Middle East. A new version of the ABU blouse has the multiple layers and inside pockets removed.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} a trucker cap {{is similar to that}} of a {{baseball}} cap, with a slightly curved bill in front, a cap constructed from six almost triangular gores, and a button on top. Instead of being made of cotton fabric like a typical baseball cap, the front section of a trucker hat above the bill is foam, and the rest is plastic mesh for breathability. The foam front of the hat stands up straight and stiff, which makes the trucker hat taller than most baseball caps. There is an adjustable plastic snap or <b>hook-and-loop</b> closure in the back to ensure that one size fits most. This design was intended to make the cap much cooler in the sun or hot weather for the comfort of the wearer.|$|E
