5|$|From April to September 1982, the Queen {{was anxious}} but {{proud of her}} son, Prince Andrew, who was serving with British forces during the Falklands War. On 9 July, the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, Michael Fagan, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> her. In a serious lapse of security, {{assistance}} only arrived after two calls to the Palace police switchboard. After hosting US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visiting his California ranch in 1983, the Queen was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada, one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her.|$|E

Wesker easily overpowers Chris and Claire, but Alice {{is able to}} defeat both Bennett and Wesker with help from K-Mart. They lock Bennett <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> Wesker's corpse. Bennett is devoured by Wesker when he revives.

Unbeknownst to them, Wesker parachutes away from the explosion, while Luther emerges from the sewers, battered but alive. Alice resolves to turn Arcadia into a real haven and broadcasts a new message for any other survivors. As Alice, Claire and Chris watch over from Arcadia, it is approached by a military squadron of Umbrella aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> her and walking away.|$|E

5|$|The visual {{opens with}} two men fighting, {{including}} one of them being thrown to the floor by the latter. Stanlistening to the action from her houseleaves the place by car, following which she and her boyfriend are presented sitting {{at opposite ends of}} a bed. The singer is eventually left by the male alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> him being shown entering a supermarket while Stan lays on the ground near a piano. Later, he gets back to her house again, but Stan closes the door in his face. Subsequently, she is portrayed traveling with a red car previously shown in the beginning, arriving at an old vehicle and holding a bird on her arm. Over the rest of the music video, the singer is shown meeting her love interest face to face two more times, including a performance of the song to a bar's crowd in which he is featured, sporting a white dress and head accessory. Her suitor ends struggling with alcohol issues. Scenes interspersed through the main video present the singer laying over the abandoned vehicle, and playing the piano in her room.|$|E
5|$|Thongs and Octopus {{are taken}} to the triad boss, who insists the baby is his grandson, only to be proven wrong by the blood test. Driven mad, the boss places the baby in a deep freeze room next to Max's corpse so the baby can be with his son, {{prompting}} Thongs and Octopus {{to fight for the}} baby. The two end up trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> two minions, but are saved when Inspector Mok arrives with the Landlord, who swiftly cracks the lock to the room. Thongs and Octopus run to the garage with the comatose baby, where Thongs attempts to revive him with a makeshift defibrillator powered by a car battery from a Pagani Zonda. Despite his efforts, the baby does not come to and is driven off in an ambulance, where his heart is found to be beating weakly. Imprisoned for kidnapping, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord volunteer for a mock capital punishment demonstration during an open day, using the opportunity to apologise to their loved ones. After the demonstration, Inspector Mok informs the three that their sentences have been further reduced by the Department of Justice. Thongs, Octopus, and the Landlord then see the baby alive and well with his parents. As a token of appreciation for saving the baby's life, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord are offered jobs by the Lee family as a bodyguard, chauffeur and head of security respectively.|$|E
25|$|Representing {{the danger}} of the Cowboys to the {{business}} owners and citizens, on Saturday, March25, 1882, Martin R.

25|$|The {{video is}} {{shot in a}} grey room, where Yonezu wearing a flower wreath and long hair {{covering}} his face sits down to read a picture book. The picture book illustrates the song, showing pictures of two hands {{on top of each}} other, and a couple separated in every moment of their lives by a glass pane. Yonezu walks around the room, and finds holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> light shining through them. Further along there is a barren tree, with the lyrics of the song hanging on it. Yonezu sits under the tree with the book. The girl in the picture book leaves the drawings, leaving the male character alone. Yonezu starts to frantically claw at the holes of light, and falls down. On {{the other side of the}} holes of light, Yonezu performs the song with a band and an orchestra.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} from Whorf's {{experience}} as a chemical engineer working for an insurance company as a fire inspector. While inspecting a chemical plant he observed that the plant had two storage rooms for gasoline barrels, one for the full barrels {{and one for the}} empty ones. He further noticed that while no employees smoked cigarettes in the room for full barrels, no-one minded smoking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> empty barrels, although this was potentially much more dangerous because of the highly flammable vapors still in the barrels. He concluded that {{the use of the word}} empty in connection to the barrels had led the workers to unconsciously regard them as harmless, although consciously they were probably aware of the risk of explosion. This example was later criticized by Lenneberg as not actually demonstrating causality between the use of the word empty and the action of smoking, but instead was an example of circular reasoning. Pinker in The Language Instinct ridiculed this example, claiming that this was a failing of human insight rather than language.|$|E
500|$|Whorf {{helped to}} attract new {{customers}} to the Fire Insurance Company; they favored his thorough inspections and recommendations. Another famous anecdote from his job was used by Whorf to argue that language use affects habitual behavior. Whorf described a workplace in which full gasoline drums were stored in one room and empty ones in another; he said that because of flammable vapor the [...] "empty" [...] drums were more dangerous than those that were full, although workers handled them less carefully {{to the point that}} they smoked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> [...] "empty" [...] drums, but not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> full ones. Whorf argued that by habitually speaking of the vapor-filled drums as empty and by extension as inert, the workers were oblivious to the risk posed by smoking near the [...] "empty drums".|$|E

When they leave, the dog tells the Snowman the couple are sweethearts who will someday move into [...] "the same kennel and share their bones." [...] He then recounts happier days when he slept under the stove in the housekeeper‘s room as a pampered pet.

500|$|Radiohead {{had created}} Kid A and Amnesiac, {{recorded}} simultaneously, through a years-long process of recording and editing that drummer Phil Selway described as [...] "manufacturing {{music in the}} studio". For their next album, the band sought to capture a more immediate, [...] "live" [...] sound. Yorke told MTV: [...] "The last two studio records were a real headache. We had {{spent so much time}} looking at computers and grids, we were like, that's enough, we can't do that any more. This time, we used computers, but they had to actually be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> all the gear. So everything was about performance, like staging a play." ...|$|E

Ripley accuses Burke of releasing the facehuggers {{so that they would}} impregnate her and Newt, allowing him to smuggle the embryos past Earth's quarantine, and of planning to kill the rest of the marines so that no one could contradict his version of events. Before the marines can execute Burke in response to the accusation, the electricity is cut, and aliens assault through the ceiling. Hicks is injured and Newt is captured, but Burke, Gorman, Hudson and Vasquez are killed in the attack.|$|E

500|$|The {{song that}} Scully keeps {{hearing in the}} episode is [...] "Don't Look Any Further", {{originally}} by former Temptations lead singer Dennis Edwards. The production staff went through several cover versions {{in order to find}} the right one for the episode. Unfortunately, according to Paul Rabwin, none of the songs [...] "really worked." [...] Originally, Rabwin wanted Lyle Lovett to record a cover for the episode, but he was unavailable, so the staff asked singer-songwriter John Hiatt. Rabwin later called Hiatt's version [...] "chilling, eerie, and soulful.". Mark Snow, the show's composer, used various musical effects for emphasis. He explained, [...] "There's a slo-mo scene where Mulder comes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> Scully and guns are drawn. They're looking around, and I do these big boom single hits with a lot of reverb. There's nothing else but that. Sometimes, that is really effective." ...|$|E
500|$|For a time, Very {{tried to}} recruit Nathaniel Hawthorne as a brother figure in his life. Though Hawthorne treated him kindly, {{he was not}} {{impressed}} by Very. Unlike Hawthorne, Emerson found him [...] "remarkable" [...] and, when Very showed up at his home unannounced along with Cornelius Conway Felton in 1838, Emerson invited several other friends, including Henry David Thoreau, to meet him. Emerson, however, was surprised at Very's behavior in larger groups. [...] "When he is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> other persons, speech stops, {{as if there were}} a corpse in the apartment", he wrote. Even so, in May 1838, the same month Very published his [...] "Epic Poetry" [...] lecture in the Christian Examiner, Emerson brought Very to a meeting of the Transcendental Club, where the topic of discussion was [...] "the question of mysticism". At the meeting, held at the home of Caleb Stetson in Medford, Massachusetts, Very was actively engaged in the discussion, building his reputation as a mystic within that circle.|$|E

They had mixed reactions to his suggestions; {{at one point during}} production of [...] "Hapsburg Lippp" [...] – a track which did not make the final track listing – Price returned them a reggae-inspired mix as a joke. Higgs explained to Andy Morris of Gigwise that Price had an [...] "ability to become one of us very quickly". Price joined them in person for the last nine days of recording.

Archer constantly tries to imitate Burt and always raves about Burt's movies and all-around awesomeness. So to have Burt recording voice-overs for the show was just amazing." [...] After receiving the episode's script from Reed, Reynolds made several edits; while editing the script of the episode, Reynolds added {{a scene in which}} Sterling reveals that his career choice was largely influenced by his films. [...] "We sent him the script beforehand and he noted the script up pretty good. But it was all to make it more self-deprecating." [...] Reed, a fan of Reynolds, said that working with him was a great experience. [...] "It was such a surreal experience being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> Burt Reynolds, my childhood hero," [...] he affirmed.
