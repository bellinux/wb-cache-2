To {{study the}} effect of a strong {{underwater}} shock wave on a concrete dam, in this research the <b>hammers</b> <b>impact</b> were applied to simulate the underwater shock in a model test. The model scale Lλ was 200 according to the gravity-elasticity similitude law. Five acceleration sensors were imbedded along the downstream surface of the dam. The maximum input pressure was evaluated based on the recorded accelerations. The explosive charge and the distance between the explosion center and the dam were determined corresponding to the maximum impact pressure. After the <b>hammers</b> <b>impacted,</b> the upstream face of the dam was fractured and downstream was scabbed; some cracks extended from the upstream face to the downstream face; the head of dam was projected; and the dam appeared entirely displacement. Although the damage similarity of the model and prototype is not verified, this method may be used to verify the quality of a protection project and offered evidence to define a protection project...|$|R

Therefore, noninvasive <b>impact</b> <b>hammers</b> – to be specific Schmitt <b>impact</b> <b>hammer</b> – were used for determination of structural concrete strength. However, efficiency of calibration correlation using <b>impact</b> <b>hammer</b> volume indicated in standards (e. g.

Given the importance of rock bolts, the research outlined in this paper attempts to develop a portable non-destructive evaluation method for assessing the length of installed rock bolts for inspection purposes. Traditionally, piezoelectric elements or <b>hammer</b> <b>impacts</b> were used to perform non-destructive evaluation of rock bolts. However, such methods suffered from many major issues, such as the weak energy generated and the requirement for permanent installation for piezoelectric elements, and the inconsistency of wave generation for <b>hammer</b> <b>impact.</b> In this paper, we proposed a portable device for the non-destructive evaluation of rock bolt conditions based on a giant magnetostrictive (GMS) actuator. The GMS actuator generates enough energy to ensure multiple reflections of the stress waves along the rock bolt and a lead zirconate titantate (PZT) sensor is used to detect the reflected waves. A new integrated procedure that involves correlation analysis, wavelet denoising, and Hilbert transform was proposed to process the multiple reflection signals to determine the length of an installed rock bolt. The experimental results from a lab test and field tests showed that, by analyzing the instant phase of the periodic reflections of the stress wave generated by the GMS transducer, the length of an embedded rock bolt can be accurately determined...|$|R

Economical efficiency of their production {{has been shown}} in the paper. The paper provides a pile cap design that ensures perception of <b>hammer</b> <b>impacts</b> with the help of lateral edges of the pile cap. Driven reinforced concrete piles which are manufactured from three shaft sections having various strength have been proposed in the paper. Material strength (concrete grade and diameter of bars) and length of shaft sections are given on a case by case basis in accordance with nature and rate of stresses in piles during their driving process. Manufacturing of polystrong piles provides an opportunity to select them for a particular construction site with due account of their preservation during driving process. A pile cap has been developed that as opposed to existing analogous designs makes it possible to transmit impact efforts from a hammer to the pile through lateral surface of its head part. The pile cap provides the possibility to increase an area for perception of <b>hammer</b> <b>impact</b> efforts by the pile and in doing so it is possible significantly to reduce a damage risk and destruction of pile concrete during its driving. Application of polystrong piles and their driving with the help of new pile cap are considered as a basis for defect-free and resource-saving technology for pile foundations in the construction. </p...|$|R

Main objectives are the investigation of the pile response and the free field vibrations due to low strain dynamic loading on a single cast in situ pile with a 5. 5 kg <b>hammer</b> <b>impact</b> on the pile head. Whereas low strain testing is usually performed to assess the integrity of the pile as a structural member, this study focuses on both pile and ground vibrations. The pile head response and ground motions are measured with accelerometers during different blows with the <b>impact</b> <b>hammer.</b> The dynamic characteristics of the soil are determined with a SASW test. Experimental results are compared with predictions obtained with a coupled finite element-boundary element model. The computed pile head and free field response show a good correspondence with the measured response. In addition, the static stiffness of the pile estimated by means of the mobility function shows a very good agreement with the value calculated by an analytical formulation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The {{objective of this}} thesis was {{to look at the}} dynamic behavior of a timber-concrete composite system, where the concrete deck consisted of several prefabricated elements glued together. The shear connector used was a glued-in steel mesh, which had shown strong capacity in previous studies. The concrete was fibre reinforced concrete. A full-scale model was built in the laboratory, and the following tests were performed: A dynamic test (<b>hammer</b> <b>impact</b> test) and a deflection test with 1 kN load. In addition a direct shear test was performed on two asymmetrical specimen to find the stiffness of the shear connector. The fibre reinforced concrete was tested separately to find its characteristic properties. There was also made a numerical model in ABAQUS, to estimate the behavior of the composite beam. The <b>hammer</b> <b>impact</b> test showed that the composite beam satisfied the dynamic requirements sat for the beam. The shear connector proved to be weaker and more ductile than expected. It was discovered this was due to insufficient gluing during the assembly. The numerical analyses done in combination with the empirical tests proved to give good estimates on the behavior of the composite beam. The stiffness of the shear connector proved to be more decisive of the deflection of the beam than the frequency. Expanding the beam to a full-size floor in ABAQUS indicated that the composite beam gave smaller values for the frequency than what would be the case for a full floor. The overall performance of the timber-concrete composite system tested in this thesis was good. However, some adjustments should be made and more research has to be done, before developing this into a new floor system. </p...|$|R
