40|$|Since {{occupational}} accidents {{often occur}} in farm tractor drivers, {{it is extremely}} important to focus the attention on specific devices {{in order to avoid}} risks from tractor overturning. This phenomenon is actually considered as the leading cause of deaths or injuries related to agricultural work. The system adopted to reduce the above-mentioned risk consists of passive protection devices aimed at preventing the hazardous event which may affect workers’ health. More precisely, the tractor chassis (i. e. ROPS) and the proper seat belt define a “safety volume” around the worker. The aim of the present research is to carry out tests on narrow-track wheeled tractors with <b>fixed</b> <b>roll</b> over protective structures in those areas – such as hazel and olive groves and vineyards - where problems related to under–tree activities occur. This is to implement planting layout and/or cultivation techniques which can be considered suitable for tractors with roll over protective structures.

The results show that nowadays only a few agricultural vehicles are provided with specific fixed devices able to work under tree without damaging orchards...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{dynamics}} of the accelerating bicycle. It is shown that time-scale separation can be used to study the oscillatory characteristics of the accelerating machine using time-invariant models. These models are used to explain practically observed wobble-mode bursting oscillations that are associated most frequently with down-hill riding. If the vehicle is cornering under constant acceleration, at a <b>fixed</b> <b>roll</b> angle, it is shown that for low values of acceleration (and braking), it follows closely a logarithmic spiral shaped trajectory. The studies presented are facilitated by a novel adaptive control scheme that centers the machine's trajectory on any arbitrary point in the ground plane. The influences of cambered road surfaces are also investigated. The bicycle model employed is an extension of that originally developed by Whipple, and comprises two road wheels and two laterally-symmetric frame assemblies that are free to rotate relative to each other along an inclined steering axis. For the most part, the front frame is treated as being flexible and the bicycle is fitted with force generating road tires, rather than classical nonholonomic rolling constraints. This research provides the ground work required for generating more complex dynamic models for high-performance motorcycle studies. © 2010 American Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|E

40|$|Currently, Slocum Autonomous Underwater Gliders (AUGs) {{are widely}} used in oceanographic research. However, {{compared}} to the other legacy AUGs, Spray gliders and Seagliders, the roll controllability is insufficient on the Slocum gliders. This thesis discusses two different approaches of improving the roll controllability on a Slocum underwater glider. With improved roll motion, the Slocum glider {{has the potential to be}} involved in iceberg management along the Newfoundland and Labrador coast, and to fulfill the mission of iceberg surveillance and data reporting; for example, iceberg draft measurement and profiling. The operation of a Slocum glider will be safer and less expensive than the current ship based method. A simplified dynamic model of an underwater glider is derived and evaluated by comparing the simulation result with the field trial data collected in Conception Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, 2010. The presented dynamic model can be easily modified to represent various realistic Slocum glider internal mass arrangements or even other types of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). In addition to the existing internal structure of a Slocum glider, a movable mass, the position of which is variable in the wingspan direction, is introduced to investigate the 6 degree of freedom (DOF) performance of a Slocum glider, especially the roll and yaw motions. Two roll control mechanisms are introduced in this thesis. Based on the field data, a small roll angle (2 ° to 5 ﾟ) exists in the mission due to a small error of separation between the center of buoyancy and the center of gravity in the roll trimming or other environmental effects. An Autonomous Roll Trimming Mechanism (ARTM) evolving from the wingspan movable mass is designed to simplify the roll trimming process and to eliminate the dynamic roll angle error during the flight. In the design of the Deflectable Wingtip Mechanism(DWM), the standard flat-plate wing sets are replaced by NACA 00 l 2 airfoil sections and deflectable wingtips. A miniature geared stepper motor is integrated into the wing to control the wingtip deflection angle. The mechanism rolls the glider by reversing the lift forces on the wingtips which create a rolling moment and roll the Slocum glider with an angle up to 45 °. Simulated with the previously introduced and evaluated dynamic model, the Slocum glider flies in a spiral motion with a <b>fixed</b> <b>roll</b> angle with a deflection on the wingtip. In order to control the spiral motion properly, the spiral parameters, such as turning radius and roll angle, are further examined. We illustrated the relationship between the angle of attack of the wingtip and the spiral motion performance. [...] Beyond the mathematical analysis of the DWM, a hydrodynamic test is applied on the DWM. A hydrodynamic testing platform is designed, on which the angle of attack of the DWM, the sweep angle, and the wingtip deflection angle are variable. The experiments are conducted in the Open water flume tank located at the Engineering Department of Memorial University of Newfoundland. The forces and torques are collected using a 3 -axis JR 3 load cell. As a result, the hydrodynamic characteristics of the DWM with different experimental settups are Obtained and compared...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{investigations into}} a number of coating processes using experimental, analytical and computational techniques. The first problem, considered experimentally, is that of reverse roll coating with a liquid reservoir positioned directly above horizontally aligned rollers. Measurements of the film thickness {{as a function of the}} height of fluid in the reservoir and speed ratio are presented. When the wetting line is located downstream of the nip, either a decrease in the height of the associated hydrostatic head or an increase in the speed ratio causes a reduction in the thickness of the outgoing film. However, when the wetting line is located upstream of the nip the opposite is found to be true. The bead-break instability in forward meniscus coating is considered both experimentally and analytically. Agreement between predictions from a simple mathematical model of the stable bead and experimentally determined meniscus positions is seen to be excellent. A perturbation hypothesis is used to predict the onset of the bead-break instability, at which the upstream meniscus accelerates rapidly towards the downstream one, so the two collide and the bead collapses. The results from the model compare well with experiments. An outline of a method for using the bead-break instability as a design criterion is also presented. Typically in a slot, blade or knife coater the downstream meniscus is assumed to pin at a corner of the coating device. In chapter 5, a series of experiments and a corresponding computational study, are presented which illustrate that the meniscus can advance up the face of such coating devices (in this case a roll-flat plate system). Reducing the corner angle is seen to reduce the size of the climb region and the associated recirculation at this point at the downstream meniscus. It is also shown that the meniscus can detach from the corner and retreat into the gap, which can in turn give rise to the ribbing instability. An offset gravure coating arrangement is considered in chapter 6. The coating arrangement is split into two areas of study - the offset gravure nip and the kiss coating bead. An experimental investigation of the offset nip with the two rolls vertically aligned and running at the same speed in forward mode reveals two ways in which the metered film thickness can be influenced. Either increasing the nip force by pressing the two rolls together or decreasing the roll speeds causes a reduction in the metered film thickness. At higher speeds the metered film thickness is observed to asymptote to a limiting value, the value of which depends on the gravure pattern. The reverse mode kiss coating bead operating at speed ratios greater than one is also investigated. Experiments reveal that under these conditions, all the fluid is transferred from the roll surface to the web and the two make contact due to the generation of a sub-ambient pressure field within the bead. Two models based on lubrication theory are derived, one assuming an infinitely tensioned web and a second that incorporates the effect of web flexibility. The latter is found to give much better agreement with the experimental data. Finally a perturbation hypothesis is applied to these to models in order to predict the onset of the ribbing instability, both of which are found to give reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Finally, the results of a systematic experimental investigation of reverse mode direct gravure coating is reported, where the web runs directly over a gravure roll surface. This wide ranging parametric study illustrates the effect of the operating parameters on the final film thickness. Key findings are that speed ratio, fluid properties and cell shape and size can significantly influence the final film thickness. For a <b>fixed</b> <b>roll</b> speed it is observed that as the web speed is increased the gravure bead becomes unstable. This results in streaking on the web, and gives an upper limit to the speed ratio. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBy {{exploiting}} the coupling between convection and thermodiffusion, we examine {{in this study}} the possibility to perform separation of species in viscoelastic solutions saturating a porous cavity heated from below. We analyze the thermal convection thresholds and linear characteristics of the primary and secondary instabilities for binary mixtures with viscoelastic properties {{taking into account the}} Soret effect and the lateral confinement of the medium. We focus on viscoelastic mixtures with positive separation ratio ψ, a dimensionless parameter which represents the mass contribution divided by the temperature contribution to buoyancy forces and is proportional to the strength of the Soret effect. In that case, the lighter component of the viscoelastic solution is driven into the direction of the bottom of the cavity, thus further enhancing the density gradient. We find that for sufficiently elastic mixtures, oscillatory instability may be sustained for small positive ψ contrary to the case of Newtonian mixtures, where oscillatory convection occurs only for ψ ψmono> 0 a stationary bifurcation leads to a monocellular flow at the onset of convection, with a horizontal stratification of the concentration, allowing separation of species between the two ends of the cell. The optimum of separation is obtained for a particular value Raopt of the Rayleigh number. The linear stability analysis of the monocellular flow is performed, and the critical conditions above which the flow becomes unstable are determined. The combined influence of the viscoelastic parameters and the lateral confinement on the characteristics of the secondary instability is quantified as a function of ψ. It is found that, depending on the lateral confinement, the monocellular flow may lose its stability via a Hopf bifurcation giving rise to transversal travelling rolls or via a stationary bifurcation to <b>fixed</b> longitudinal <b>rolls.</b> When the secondary bifurcation is a Hopf one, two regimes of convection are identified. While the viscoelastic mechanism {{plays a key role in}} one regime, the other regime is dominated by the Soret effect. Independently of the nature of the secondary instability pattern, it is shown that the monocellular flow remains stable beyond Raopt indicating that optimal separation of species is possible for viscoelastic solutions...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} the stability of elliptical vortex in rotating stratified flows is completed in the present study. Firstly, we analyze the stability of a Lagrangian unsteady non-uniform vortices with a shorter wavelength WKB type formalism. It appears that the mechanism of destabilization of these eddies {{is the same as}} the one destabilizinga elliptical uniform vortex. This result shows that the elliptical instability is a universal 3 D mechanism of destabilization 2 D vortex. In a second time, is theoretically and experimentally studied the stability of elliptical eddies confined in a stratified fluid in rotation. The experimental device allowing the study consists of a rotating cylinder (filled with a stratified fluid in density following the vertical), elliptical distorted by two <b>rolls</b> <b>fixed,</b> all united by a panel also rotating. By varying the parameters of our experience (the frequency of Brunt-Väisälä Nb and the absolute vorticity Ta, the two quantities are non dimensional by the relative rate of rotation of fluid particles), we observed that the rotation and the stratification have antagonist contribution to the stability of elliptical vortices. Thus, if the stratification is sufficiently strong (Nb > 1), we observe that only anticyclones (such as |Ta| 1), nous observons que seuls les anticyclones (tels que |Ta| < 1) sont instables. Les cyclones étant toujours stables. Par ailleurs si la stratification est faible (Nb < 1), les zones d'instabilité s'inversent. Finalement les longueurs d'ondes ainsi que les taux de croissance des modes, mesurés par analyse d'images, sont en bon accord avec les prévisions théoriques...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative "observer" {{models for}} spatial {{orientation}} and eye movements {{have been developed}} based on 1 -G data from humans and animals (e. g. Oman 1982, 1991, Merfeld, et al 1993, 2002; Haslwanter 2000, Vingerhoets 2006). These models assume that the CNS estimates "down", head angular velocity and linear acceleration utilizing an internal model for gravity and sense organ dynamics, continuously updated by sensory-conflict signals. CNS function is thus analogous to a Luenberger state observer in engineering systems. Using a relatively small set of free parameters, Observer orientation models capture the main features of experimental data {{for a variety of}} different motion stimuli. We developed a Matlab/Simulink based Observer model, including Excel spreadsheet input capability and a GUI to make the model accessible to less expert Matlab users. Orientation and motion predictions can be plotted in 2 D or visualized in 3 D using virtual avatars. Our Observer's internal model now computes azimuth, and pseudointegrates linear motion in an allocentric reference frame (perceived north-east-down). The model mimics the large perceptual errors for vertical motion observed experimentally. It retains the well validated "vestibular core" of the Merfeld perceptual model and predicts responses to angular velocity and linear accelerations steps, dumping, <b>fixed</b> radius centrifugation, <b>roll</b> tilt and OVAR. This model was further extended to include static and dynamic visual sensory information from four independent visual sensors (Visual Velocity, Position, Angular Velocity and Gravity/"Down"). (cont.) Visual additions were validated against the Borah et al (1978) Kalman filter simulation results and validation data sets (Earth vertical constant velocity rotation in the light, somatogravic illusion in the light, and linear and circular vection). The model predicts that circular vection should have two dynamic components, and the recent finding of Tokumaru et al (1998) that visual cues influence somatogravic illusion in ways not accounted for by the Borah model. The model also correctly predicts both the direction of Coriolis illusion, and the magnitude of the resulting tilt illusion. It also predicts that the direction and mechanism of Pseudo-Coriolis illusion is fundamentally different from Coriolis, a prediction verified by means of a pilot experiment. Finally, the model accounts for the dynamics of astronaut post-flight tilt-gain and OTTR vertigos in ways not explained by previous static analyses (e. g. Merfeld, 2003).
