The nearby and <b>intermediate</b> <b>surveys</b> {{are assumed to be}} conducted from the ground, while the high-z is a joint ground- and space-based survey. This latter survey, the "Dark Energy Supernova Infra-Red Experiment" (DESIRE), is designed to fit within 6 months of Euclid observing time, with a dedicated observing programme. We simulate the SN events as they would be observed in rolling-search mode by the various instruments, and derive the quality of expected cosmological constraints. We account for known systematic uncertainties, in particular calibration uncertainties including their contribution through the training of the supernova model used to fit the supernovae light curves. Using conservative assumptions and a 1 D geometric Planck prior, we find that the ensemble of surveys would yield competitive constraints: a constant equation of stateparameter can be constrained to sigma(w) = 0. 022, and a Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit of 203 is found for a two-parameter equation of state. Our simulations thus indicate that Euclid can bring a significant contribution to a purely geometrical cosmology constraint by extending a high-quality SN Ia Hubble diagram to z ~ 1. 5.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a secondary {{analysis of the}} NZCER 2010 Primary and <b>Intermediate</b> Schools National <b>Survey.</b> The aim of this project was to conduct an exploratory investigation into the attitudes of education stakeholders toward National Standards. Open response data from the NZCER 2010 Primary and <b>Intermediate</b> Schools National <b>Survey</b> principal, teacher, trustee, and parent questionnaires was coded in two different ways. First, a thematic framework was developed and the open responses were coded against the themes. The open responses were then recoded as a binary attitude variable, according to whether they were considered to convey a negative or positive attitude toward the standards. Logistic regression and Fisher’s exact tests {{were used to determine}} statistically significant relationships between the binary attitude variable and other elements of the survey data, in the interests of finding predictors for attitude to the National Standards. These analyses were carried out with a selection of items from each of the principal, teacher, and trustee questionnaires; and with all of the items from the parent questionnaire. For teachers and principals (and to a lesser extent, trustees), findings from the thematic analysis of open responses largely reflected concerns about the standards being voiced by sector groups and academics around the time the survey was undertaken. Results from the statistical analysis of the binary attitude variable indicated that principal and teacher attitudes were associated with teaching experience and career plans. General findings from the analysis of parent responses included a suggestion that parents may lack knowledge and understanding of the National Standards, and may be expecting the standards to deliver something they are not designed for. Patterns in parent responses also indicated that attitudes to the National Standards might be related to wider perceptions of the purpose of education, and the various roles of education stakeholders. A similar pattern emerged in analysis of trustee responses. More specific findings related to parent attitude included associations with student year level, and with school reporting practice...|$|R

We also investigated the completeness of our X-ray selected sample by observing more than 100 stars that were not detected as X-ray sources, but have proper motions indicating membership to Upper Sco. While the new X-ray selected PMS stars with known proper motions have kinematics consistent with membership, none of the X-ray quiet proper motion candidates is a PMS star.

40|$|This is a {{draft of}} a {{monograph}} {{to appear in the}} Springer series "Encyclopaedia of Mathematical Sciences", subseries "Invariant Theory and Algebraic Transformation Groups". The subject is homogeneous spaces of algebraic groups and their equivariant embeddings. The style of exposition is <b>intermediate</b> between <b>survey</b> and detailed monograph: some results are supplied with detailed proofs, while the other are cited without proofs but with references to the original papers. The content is briefly as follows. Starting with basic properties of algebraic homogeneous spaces and related objects, such as induced representations, we focus the attention on homogeneous spaces of reductive groups and introduce two important invariants, called complexity and rank. For the embedding theory it is important that homogeneous spaces of small complexity admit a transparent combinatorial description of their equivariant embeddings. We consider the Luna-Vust theory of equivariant embeddings, paying special attention to the case of complexity not greater than one. A special chapter is devoted to spherical varieties (= embeddings of homogeneous spaces of complexity zero), due to their particular importance and ubiquity. A relation between equivariant embedding theory and equivariant symplectic geometry is also discussed. The book contains several classification results (homogeneous spaces of small complexity, etc).

40|$|Multibeam Echosounder data is a {{powerful}} method for rapidly mapping the seabed, either from the water surface or from a remote (or autonomous) vehicle. However, the data density of such systems can make data handling difficult, and most conventional processing schemes are subjective due to their reliance on human experience. We describe an automatic scheme for converting raw data to a preliminary gridded product without human interaction, using the estimated measurement error of the data to adjudge the reliability of each sounding and hence the weight {{that it should be}} given in the grid. Along with a propagation of information argument which implicitly defines the local bathymetry, the algorithm is able to track multiple estimates of depth to provide extra robustness (e. g., in the face of burst-mode instrument failure, or outlier data) and can continually update its estimate of the bathymetry as new data is presented, potentially from multiple sources or measurement systems. All depth hypotheses are maintained on-line so that human revision of the estimates is possible after the algorithm 2 ̆ 7 s best resolution is determined. We illustrate the algorithm on two datasets: a shallow water survey in Portsmouth, NH, and an <b>intermediate</b> depth <b>survey</b> on the west Florida shelf, Gulf of Mexico, where we also compare the surfaces generated by conventional processing methodologies.

In this study, we evaluated {{the ability of}} six anadromous salmonids (coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, pink salmon O. gorbuscha, chum salmon O. keta, sockeye salmon O. nerka, Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, and steelhead O. mykiss) to pass five sets of falls or cascades within Ward Creek, Alaska, a stream regulated by Connell Dam. The study focused on determining suitable instream flow releases to afford passage. Each set of falls was surveyed under three flow conditions (about 0. 91, 1. 34, and 3. 0 m(3) /s), and access portals were identified. Using computed stage-discharge relationships and published swimming and jumping criteria, we evaluated the falls barrier potential over a range (0. 23 - 11. 33 m(3) /s) Of flows. Analysis indicated pink salmon and chum salmon would be relegated to the area below the lower two falls. Flows affording passage over all five falls for the other species (excluding Chinook salmon) were defined as 2 ̆ 2 flow windows 2 ̆ 2 and ranged from 0. 66 to 3. 01 m(3) /s. Flow windows varied by species; the narrowest range of acceptable passage flows was found for sockeye salmon, the widest was found for steelhead, and the range for coho salmon was <b>intermediate.</b> Escapement <b>surveys</b> generally confirmed our analysis; pink salmon and chum salmon were only found below the lowermost falls. The flow windows for passage were compatible {{with a set of}} instream flow recommendations derived via a PHABSIM-based study but were incompatible with the highest flow recommendation based on the method of Tennant (1976). Care must be taken when evaluating instream flow needs to ensure that all flow-sensitive factors are considered...|$|R
