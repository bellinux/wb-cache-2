5|$|The ships mounted four 10-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns in twin-gun turrets {{fore and}} aft of the superstructure. The guns could fire both solid shot and {{explosive}} shells. They were mounted on carriages that used hydraulic jacks to <b>elevate</b> and depress the guns.|$|E
5|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} weakness of these ships lay in {{their inability to}} generate sufficient electric current to power the multitude of auxiliary motors on which their advanced machinery and complex gun mountings were dependent. Their DC electrical supply was only 115V, whereas larger cruisers with power-operated turrets had a 230V system. Electrical power was generated by two Alsthom turbo-generators rated at only 120kW with two small diesel generators rated at 44/52kW for use when the ship was alongside. The latter provided only for the ship's minimum lighting and electricity needs, and fires had to be lit {{in at least one}} of the boilers in order to train the turrets or <b>elevate</b> the guns for practice or maintenance. Many of the auxiliary motors themselves were also seriously underpowered, particularly the servomotors for the gun mountings (which were slow to train and <b>elevate)</b> and for the rudder which contributed to the ship's poor maneuverability. In technological terms Mogador and Volta were ships with the armament of a light cruiser in the hull of a destroyer; the contre-torpilleur as a type had been pushed past the limits of its capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Classifications {{published}} {{since the}} use of molecular phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (s.s.). In 1998, Tamura considered Calochortus sufficiently distinct to <b>elevate</b> the subfamily Calochortoideae to family status as Calochortaceae, resulting in the term Liliaceae sensu Tamura to indicate Liliaceae without the Calochortoideae. In 2009, Takhtajan used an even narrower definition (see Table 2 & Table 3 below).|$|E
50|$|The Causeway Street <b>Elevated</b> {{was one of}} {{the last}} pieces of <b>elevated</b> line {{constructed}} in Boston, and, except for a short section remaining at Lechmere, was the last section in service. Although initial plans had called for the Cambridge-Dorchester Line to be constructed as an <b>elevated,</b> the Causeway Street <b>Elevated</b> was the only <b>elevated</b> in Boston not part of the Main Line <b>Elevated.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{station is}} one of a small number of <b>elevated</b> rapid transit {{stations}} remaining in the MBTA system. (The only others are Beachmont, Science Park, Malden Center, Wollaston, and Fields Corner; Lechmere will also become an <b>elevated</b> station as part of the Green Line Extension.) Boston once had several <b>elevated</b> lines, but the Atlantic Avenue <b>Elevated,</b> Charlestown <b>Elevated,</b> Washington Street <b>Elevated,</b> and Causeway Street <b>Elevated</b> were all torn down in favor of subway and surface-level lines.|$|R

5|$|Near Adelaide, in South Australia, three {{bottlenose}} dolphins 'tail-walk', whereby they <b>elevate</b> {{the upper}} part of their bodies vertically out of the water, and propel themselves along the surface with powerful tail movements. Tail-walking mostly arises via human training in dolphinaria. In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 27, sentries {{informed}} Magaw that Percy's troops were launching an attack supported by two frigates sailing up the Hudson. Magaw ordered {{an attack on the}} frigates, and both British ships were badly damaged by the guns from Fort Lee and Fort Washington. The frigates could not <b>elevate</b> their own guns to the height of the American positions. The British towed away the frigates, but an artillery duel continued for some time between British and American gunners.|$|E

5|$|Peckham {{also had}} {{problems}} with his subordinate Thomas Bek, who was Bishop of St David's in Wales. Bek tried to revive a scheme to make St David's independent from Canterbury, and to <b>elevate</b> it to metropolitan status. This had originally been put forth by Gerald of Wales around 1200, but had been defeated {{by the actions of}} Hubert Walter, then the Archbishop of Canterbury. Bek did not manage even the four-year fight that Gerald had managed, for Peckham routed him quickly.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{armament}} included eighteen 15cm (5.9inch) SK L/40 guns; {{six were}} emplaced in single turrets amidships and twelve were mounted in MPL casemates. These guns fired armor-piercing shells {{at a rate}} of 4–5 per minute. The ships carried 120 shells per gun, for a total of 2,160 rounds total. The guns could depress to −7degrees and <b>elevate</b> to 20degrees, for a maximum range of 13,700m (14,990yd). They were manually elevated and trained.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews for}} its portrayal of homosexuality.

25|$|On April 10, 1888, the Union <b>Elevated</b> {{opened the}} first piece of the Myrtle Avenue <b>Elevated,</b> from Adams Street at City Hall east over Myrtle Avenue to Grand Avenue, where it junctioned with the Brooklyn <b>Elevated.</b> The company {{operated}} through {{to the end of the}} Brooklyn <b>Elevated</b> at Van Siclen Avenue. Another branch operated by the Union <b>Elevated,</b> the Broadway <b>Elevated</b> from Gates Avenue northwest to Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, opened on June 25, 1888. This was extended to Broadway Ferry on July 14, 1888. The Myrtle Avenue <b>Elevated</b> was extended north over Adams Street to Sands Street at the Brooklyn Bridge on September 1, 1888, and the Union <b>Elevated</b> began running between Sands Street and Van Siclen Avenue. The Union <b>Elevated</b> opened the Hudson Avenue <b>Elevated,</b> a branch of the Brooklyn <b>Elevated</b> from the intersection of Hudson and Park Avenues south to the Long Island Rail Road's Flatbush Avenue terminal, on November 5, 1888, and began operating between Fulton Ferry and Flatbush Avenue.|$|R
5|$|The {{music played}} during the {{broadcast}} of the 1939 radio speech at {{the climax of the}} film is from the 2nd movement (Allegretto) of Beethoven's 7th Symphony; it was added by Tariq Anwar, the editor. When Desplat later joined the team to write the music, he praised and defended Anwar's suggestion. Hooper further remarked that the stature of the piece helps <b>elevate</b> the status of the speech to a public event.|$|E
5|$|These guns fired 100lb (45.4kg) shells {{at a rate}} {{of between}} 57 per minute. The shells were fired with a muzzle {{velocity}} of 2,775fps (846mps), though the guns were capable of higher velocities. It was reduced in order to standardize the performance of all the 6inch guns in Royal Navy service, which would simplify range calculations for guns of the calibre. The guns could <b>elevate</b> to 20°, which enabled a maximum range of 15,800yd (14,450m).|$|E
5|$|Tiberius {{seems to}} have tired of {{politics}} at this point.

5|$|To <b>elevate</b> {{his son to}} Mary's rank, Emperor Charles V ceded to Philip {{the crown}} of Naples {{as well as his}} claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Therefore, Mary became Queen of Naples and titular Queen of Jerusalem upon marriage. Their wedding at Winchester Cathedral on 25 July 1554 took place just two days after their first meeting. Philip could not speak English, and so they spoke in a mixture of Spanish, French, and Latin.|$|E
5|$|When {{the emperor}} Macrinus came to power, he {{suppressed}} the threat against his reign {{from the family}} of his assassinated predecessor, Caracalla, by exiling them—Julia Maesa, her two daughters, and her eldest grandson Elagabalus—to their estate at Emesa in Syria. Almost upon arrival in Syria, Maesa began a plot with her advisor and Elagabalus' tutor, Gannys, to overthrow Macrinus and <b>elevate</b> the fourteen-year-old Elagabalus to the imperial throne.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the medieval}} chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after the Battle of Stamford Bridge Harold {{entrusted}} the loot gained from Harold Hardrada to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did {{this because he}} had heard of Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to <b>elevate</b> Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated {{over what to do}} while William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.|$|E
50|$|The Tremont Street Subway was {{extended}} north from Park Street in 1898. It {{rose to the}} surface at the Canal Street Incline, with a surface terminal at Causeway Street.
