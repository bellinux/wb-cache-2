40|$|The use {{of sensors}} {{temperature}} by thermocouple {{to determine the}} magnitude of the output voltage in the <b>kerosene</b> and <b>diesel</b> combustion were investigated. The mass fuel of <b>kerosene</b> and <b>diesel</b> were varied from 0, 2 grams to 1, 8 grams by interval of 0, 2 grams mass. The thermocouple was connected to the signal conditioning circuit and the change in temperature and the output voltage were recorded in every 10 seconds during 3 minutes.

50|$|LTTD {{has proven}} very {{effective}} in reducing concentrations of petroleum products including gasoline, jet fuels, <b>kerosene,</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel, heating oils, and lubricating oils. LTTD is applicable to constituents that are volatile at temperatures up to 1,200 °F. Most desorbers operate at temperatures between 300 °F to 1,000 °F. Desorbers constructed of special alloys can operate at temperatures up to 1,200 °F. More volatile products (e.g. gasoline) can be desorbed at the lower operating range, while semivolatile products (e.g. <b>kerosene,</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel) generally need temperatures over 700 °F, and relatively nonvolatile products (e.g., heating oil, lubricating oils) need even higher temperatures. Essentially all soil types are amenable for treatment by LTTD systems. However, different soils may require varying degrees and types of pretreatment. For example, coarse-grained soils (e.g. gravel and cobbles) may require crushing; fine-grained soils that are excessively cohesive (e.g. clay) may require shredding.|$|E

50|$|Distillation {{of crude}} oil is {{typically}} performed either under atmospheric pressure and under a vacuum. Low boiling fractions usually vaporize below 400 °C at atmospheric pressure without cracking the hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, all the low boiling fractions {{of crude oil}} are separated by atmospheric distillation. A crude distillation unit (CDU) consists of pre-flash distillation column. The petroleum products obtained from the distillation process are light, medium, and heavy naphtha, <b>kerosene,</b> <b>diesel,</b> and oil residue.|$|E

50|$|IFR {{tanks are}} used for liquids with low flash-points (e.g., ATF, MS. gasoline, ethanol). These tanks are nothing but cone roof tanks with a {{floating}} roof inside which travels up and down along with the liquid level. This floating roof traps the vapor from low flash-point fuels. Floating roofs are supported with legs or cables on which they rest.FR tanks {{do not have a}} fixed roof (it is open in the top) and has a floating roof only. Medium flash point liquids such as naphtha, <b>kerosene,</b> <b>diesel,</b> and crude oil are stored in these tanks.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors affecting the crack spread is the relative proportion of various petroleum products produced by a refinery. Refineries produce many products from crude oil, including gasoline, <b>kerosene,</b> <b>diesel,</b> heating oil, aviation fuel, asphalt and others. To some degree, the proportion of each product produced can be varied in order to suit the demands of the local market. Regional differences in the demand for each refined product depend upon the relative demand for fuel for heating, cooking or transportation purposes. Within a region, there can also be seasonal differences in demand for heating fuel versus transportation fuel.|$|E
