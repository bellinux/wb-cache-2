5000|$|Australian scholar Marcus K.

5|$|During {{spare time}} in filming, Tom Baker and Ian Marter (who played Harry Sullivan {{in the series}} and later novelised several <b>Doctor</b> <b>Who</b> scripts for Target Books) wrote a script for a <b>Doctor</b> <b>Who</b> film, <b>Doctor</b> <b>Who</b> meets Scratchman. The script, {{sometimes}} titled <b>Doctor</b> <b>Who</b> and the Big Game, saw the Doctor encounter the Daleks, meet the Devil known as Harry Scratch or Scratchman, robots known as Cybors, scarecrows made from bones, the Greek god Pan, and at times Vincent Price and Twiggy {{were associated with the}} production to play as the villain Harry Scratch and a possible new female companion after Elisabeth Sladen left the TV series. The finale of the film was to have taken place on a giant pinball table, with the Doctor, Harry and Sarah dodging balls as well as battling Daleks on the board. During his tenure as the Fourth Doctor, Baker repeatedly tried to attract funding for the film. At one point, he received substantial donations from fans, but after taking legal advice was forced to return them. The plans were eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|During the Fourth Doctor era, future <b>Doctor</b> <b>Who</b> {{script editor}} Douglas Adams {{submitted}} {{this story in}} 1976 before later preparing it as a submission for a <b>Doctor</b> <b>Who</b> film, <b>Doctor</b> <b>Who</b> and the Krikkitmen. Elements of Krikkitmen {{were used in the}} Key to Time story arc, for which Adams wrote a story, and Krikkitmen was reworked as the third Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy book Life, the Universe and Everything. A novel adaption by James Goss was released by BBC Books in January 2018.|$|E
