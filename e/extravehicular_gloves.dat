This causes the hands to swell which can cause problems for astronauts trying to do work in pressurized EVA (<b>extravehicular</b> activity) <b>gloves.</b> To better design these gloves, accurate measurements of the astronauts swollen hands are needed. Five concepts were developed in this report from an original field of 972 possible concepts.

40|$|The {{design of}} a {{wireless}} data-glove is introduced in this paper, {{the aim is to}} provide an effective and complete solution wherever a tactile sensing system has to be integrated to correctly interact with the surrounding environment (e. g., astronaut's <b>extravehicular</b> activity <b>glove).</b> The focus is on the design of the whole system, starting with the readout circuit, the digital signal encoding and ending with the data transmission. The system is made of eight quasi-digital readout circuits to convert the analog information into a pulse-density modulation. The pulse streams are then temporally ordered to form a single streams of events. By integrating a Impulse Radio Ultra-Wide Band (IR-UWB) transmitter and choosing the proper protocol and modulation, we can aim to minimize the power consumption and provide error detection, the design has also taken into account the minimization of the complexity of the receiver. The whole system, fully asynchronous, has been designed as a single full-custom chip, besides having multiple independent inputs, it can be configured both to deploy a multi-chip system (with a single receiver) and to optimize wireless transmission parameter...|$|R

Examination of the literature showed that there existed no acceptable, non-invasive method of obtaining accurate biomechanical data on the hand. For this reason a project was initiated to develop magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for biomechanical data acquisition and visualization. Literature reviews also revealed a lack of practical modeling methods for fabric structures, so a basic science research program was also initiated in this area...|$|R

Flexible sensors in each finger enable control inputs that can be mapped to any number of functions (e. g., a mouse click, a keyboard strike, or a button press). Tracking of hand motion is interpreted alternatively as movement of a mouse (change in cursor position on a graphical user interface) or a change in hand position on a virtual keyboard.

Results showed that: 1) the test battery is an efficient tool for differentiating among input devices, 2) gloved operations were about 1 second slower and had at least 15 % more errors; 3) devices used with gloves have to be larger, and should allow good hand positioning to counteract the lack of tactile feedback, 4) none of the devices, as designed, were ideal for operation with EVA gloves...|$|R

Based on an assessment of general human hand functioning and EVA task requirements several tests within each measurement domain were developed to provide a comprehensive evaluation. All tests were designed to be conducted in a glove box with the bare hand as a baseline and the EVA glove at operating pressure.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} faced in <b>Extravehicular</b> Activity (EVA) <b>glove</b> development has been the absence of concise and reliable methods to measure the effects of EVA gloves on human-hand capabilities. NASA has sponsored a program to develop a standardized set of tests designed to assess EVA-gloved hand capabilities in six performance domains: Range of Motion, Strength, Tactile Perception, Dexterity, Fatigue, and Comfort. Based upon an assessment of general human-hand functioning and EVA task requirements, several tests within each performance domain were developed to provide a comprehensive evaluation. All tests were designed to be conducted in a glove box with the bare hand, an EVA glove without pressure, an EVA glove at operation pressure. Thus, the differential effect on performance of the glove with and without pressure was tested. Bare hand performance was used to 'calibrate' the effects. Ten subjects participated in the test setup as a repeated-measures experimental design. The paper will report {{the results of the}} test program...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} effects of <b>extravehicular</b> activity (EVA) <b>gloves</b> at different pressures on human hand capabilities. A factorial experiment was performed in which three types of EVA gloves were tested at five pressure differentials. The independent variables tested in this experiment were gender, glove type, pressure differential, and glove make. Six subjects participated in an experiment where a number of dexterity measures, namely time to tie a rope, and the time to assemble a nut and bolt were recorded. Tactility was measured through a two point discrimination test. The results indicate that with EVA gloves strength is reduced by nearly 50 percent, there is a considerable reduction in dexterity, performance decrements increase with increasing pressure differential, and some interesting gender glove interactions were observed, some of which may have been due to the extent (or lack of) fit of the glove to the hand. The implications for the designer are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{quantify}} finger tactility, while wearing a Phase VI <b>Extravehicular</b> Activity (EVA) <b>glove.</b> Subjects were fully suited in an Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) suit. Data was collected under three conditions: bare-handed, gloved at 0 psi, and gloved at 4. 3 psi. In order to test tactility, a series of 30 tactile stimuli (bumps) were created that varied in both height and width. With the hand obscured, subjects applied pressure to each bump until detected tactilely. The amount of force needed to detect each bump was recorded using load cells located under a force-plate. The amount of force needed to detect a bump was positively related to width, but inversely related to height. In addition, as the psi of the glove increased, more force was needed to detect the bump. In terms of application, it was possible to determine the optimal width and height a bump needs to be for a specific amount of force applied for tactility...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} hand strength, while wearing a Phase VI <b>Extravehicular</b> Activity (EVA) <b>glove</b> in an <b>Extravehicular</b> Mobility Unit (EMU) suit. Three types of data were collected: hand grip, lateral pinch, and pulp- 2 pinch, wider three different conditions: bare-handed, gloved with no Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment (TMG), and glove with TMG. In addition, during the gloved conditions, subjects were tested when unpressurized and pressurized (43 psi). As a percentage of bare-hand strength, the TMG condition showed reduction in grip strength to 55 % unpressurized and 46 % pressurized. Without the TMG, grip strength increased to 66 % unpressurized and 58 % pressurized of bare-hand strength. For lateral pinch strength, the reduction in strength was the same for both pressure conditions and with and without the TMG, about 8. 5 % of bare-hand Pulp- 2 pinch strength with no TMG showed an increase to 122 % unpressurized and 115 % pressurized of bare-hand strength. While wearing the TMG, pulp- 2 pinch strength was 115 % of bare-hand strength for both pressure conditions...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the bulk}} and {{stiffness}} of the astronauts' <b>glove,</b> so called <b>Extravehicular</b> Activity (EVA) <b>glove,</b> many problems occur during their missions outside the spacecraft i. e. fatigue, dexterity reduction, decrease of possible EVA hours, etc. [1, 2]. To {{solve these problems}} a hand exoskeleton which can be embedded inside the astronauts' glove has been proposed {{as a solution to}} help them to move their fingers more easily. In this work all the steps that were taken towards the design of a preliminary version of the hand exoskeleton are explained in detail. The paper starts with a brief survey on related literature, followed by an analysis of three main research subjects for the design and realization of the hand exoskeleton: sensors, actuators and structure. In particular, different kinds of sensors and actuators are evaluated and advantages and disadvantages of each one are investigated. Then the main reasons to choose a specific type of sensor or actuator are described in detail. Regarding the structure, different possible solutions converging towards an optimal design for this application have been evaluated. Moreover, the use of some springs in the structure to simulate the stiffness of the EVA glove is proposed {{in order to be able}} to test the device in a condition similar to its final application.

The NGLS Project develops selected life support technologies needed for humans {{to live and work}} productively in space, with focus on technologies for future use in spacecraft cabin and space suit applications. Over the last three years, NGLS had five main project elements: Variable Oxygen Regulator (VOR), Rapid Cycle Amine (RCA) swing bed, High Performance (HP) <b>Extravehicular</b> Activity (EVA) <b>Glove,</b> Alternative Water Processor (AWP) and Series-Bosch Carbon Dioxide Reduction. The RCA swing bed, VOR and HP EVA Glove tasks are directed at key technology needs for the Portable Life Support System (PLSS) and pressure garment for an Advanced Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). Focus is on prototyping and integrated testing in cooperation with the Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) Advanced EVA Project. The HP EVA Glove Element, new this fiscal year, includes the generation of requirements and standards to guide development and evaluation of new glove designs. The AWP and Bosch efforts focus on regenerative technologies to further close spacecraft cabin atmosphere revitalization and water recovery loops and to meet technology maturation milestones defined in NASA's Space Technology Roadmaps. These activities are aimed at increasing affordability, reliability, and vehicle self-sufficiency while decreasing mass and mission cost, supporting a capability-driven architecture for extending human presence beyond low-Earth orbit, along a human path toward Mars.

40|$|The Glove-Enabled Computer Operations (GECO) system enables an <b>extravehicular</b> {{activity}} (EVA) <b>glove</b> to be dual-purposed as a {{human-computer interface}} device. This paper describes {{the design and}} human participant testing of a right-handed GECO glove in a pressurized glove box. As part of {{an investigation into the}} usability of the GECO system for EVA data entry, twenty participants were asked to complete activities including (1) a Simon Says Games in which they attempted to duplicate random sequences of targeted finger strikes and (2) a Text Entry activity in which they used the GECO glove to enter target phrases in two different virtual keyboard modes. In a within-subjects design, both activities were performed both with and without vibrotactile feedback. Participants' mean accuracies in correctly generating finger strikes with the pressurized glove were surprisingly high, both with and without the benefit of tactile feedback. Five of the subjects achieved mean accuracies exceeding 99 % in both conditions. In Text Entry, tactile feedback provided a statistically significant performance benefit, quantified by characters entered per minute, as well as reduction in error rate. Secondary analyses of responses to a NASA Task Loader Index (TLX) subjective workload assessments reveal a benefit for tactile feedback in GECO glove use for data entry. This first-ever investigation of employment of a pressurized EVA glove for human-computer interface opens up a wide range of future applications, including text "chat" communications, manipulation of procedures/checklists, cataloguing/annotating images, scientific note taking, human-robot interaction, and control of suit and/or other EVA systems...|$|R
40|$|Hand fatigue {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} problems of astronauts during their missions to space. This fatigue is due to the stiffness of the astronauts' <b>gloves</b> known as <b>Extravehicular</b> Activity (EVA) <b>gloves.</b> The EVA glove has a multilayered, bulky structure and is pressurized against the vacuum of space. In order to evaluate the stiffness of EVA gloves, different methods have been proposed in the past. In particular, the effects of wearing an EVA glove on the performance of the hands have been published by many researchers to represent the stiffness of the EVA glove. In this paper, a new method for measuring the stiffness of EVA gloves is proposed. A tendon-actuated finger probe is designed and used as an alternative to the human index finger in order to be placed inside an EVA glove and measure its stiffness. The finger probe is equipped with accelerometers, which work as tilt sensors, to measure the angles of its phalanges. The phalanges are actuated by applying different amount of torque using the tendons of the finger probe. Moreover, a hypobaric glove box is designed and realized to simulate the actual operating pressure of the EVA glove and to measure its stiffness in both pressurized and non-pressurized conditions. In order to prove the right performance of the proposed finger probe, an Orlam-DM EVA glove is used to perform a number of tests. The equation of stiffness for the PIP joint of this glove is extracted from the results acquired from the tests. This equation presents the torque required to flex the middle phalanx of the glove. Then, the effect of pressurization on the stiffness is highlighted in the last section. This setup can be used to measure the stiffness of different kinds of EVA gloves and allows direct, numerical comparison of their stiffnes...|$|R
40|$|The {{gloved hand}} {{is one of}} an {{astronaut}} s primary means of interacting with the environment, and any restrictions imposed by the glove can strongly affect performance during <b>extravehicular</b> activity (EVA). <b>Glove</b> restrictions {{have been the subject}} of study for decades, yet previous studies have generally been unsuccessful in quantifying glove mobility and tactility. Past studies have tended to focus on the dexterity, strength, and functional performance of the gloved hand; this provides only a circumspect analysis of the impact of each type of restriction on the glove s overall capability. The aim of this study was to develop novel capabilities to provide metrics for mobility and tactility that can be used to assess the performance of a glove in a way that could enable designers and engineers to improve their current designs. A series of evaluations were performed to compare unpressurized and pressurized (4. 3 psi) gloved conditions with the ungloved condition. A second series of evaluations were performed with the Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment (TMG) removed. This series of tests provided interesting insight into how much of an effect the TMG has on gloved mobility - in some cases, the presence of the TMG restricted glove mobility as much as pressurization did. Previous hypotheses had assumed that the TMG would have a much lower impact on mobility, but these results suggest that an improvement in the design of the TMG could have a significant impact on glove performance. Tactility testing illustrated the effect of glove pressurization, provided insight into the design of hardware that interfaces with the glove, and highlighted areas of concern. The metrics developed in this study served to benchmark the Phase VI EVA glove and to develop requirements for the next-generation glove for the Constellation program...|$|R
40|$|Systems and {{components}} of selected Apollo A 7 L/A 7 LB flight-article spacesuits that were worn on {{the lunar surface}} have been studied to determine {{the degree to which}} they suffered contamination, abrasion and wear or loss of function due to effects from lunar soil particles. Filter materials from the lithium hydroxide (LiOH) canisters from the Apollo Command Module were also studied to determine the amount and type of any lunar dust particles they may have captured from the spacecraft atmosphere. The specific spacesuit study materials include the outermost soft fabric layers on Apollo 12 and 17 integrated thermal micrometeorite garment assemblies and outermost fabrics on Apollo 17 <b>extravehicular</b> pressure <b>gloves.</b> In addition, the degree of surface wear in the sealed wrist rotation bearing from Apollo 16 extravehicular and intravehicular pressure gloves was evaluated and compared. Scanning electron microscope examination of the Apollo 12 T- 164 woven TeflonO fabric confirms the presence of lunar soil particles and the ability of these particles to cause separation and fraying of the Teflon fibers. Optical imaging, chemical analysis and particle sampling applied to the outer fabric of the Apollo 17 spacesuit has identified Ti as a potentially useful chemical marker for comparing the amount of lunar soil retained on different areas of the spacesuit outer fabric. High-yield particle sampling from the Apollo 17 fabric surfaces using adhesive tape found 80 % of particles on the fabric are lunar soil particles averaging 10. 5 m in diameter, with the rest being intrinsic fabric materials or environmental contaminants. Analysis of the mineralogical composition of the lunar particles found that on a grain-count basis the particle population is dominated by plagioclase feldspar and various types of glassy particles derived mostly from soil agglutinates, with a subordinate amount of pyroxene. On a grain size basis, however, the pyroxene grains are generally a factor of 2 larger than glass and plagioclase, so conversion of the data to a modal (volume %) basis results in pyroxene becoming the modally dominant particle type with glass and plagioclase significantly less abundant. When comparisons are made to the modal composition of lunar soil at the Apollo 17 landing site, the results suggest that pyroxene particles have overall better retention on the spacesuit outer fabric compared to plagioclase and especially glass. Scanning electron microscopy revealed no measureable difference in the amount of wear and abrasion in the wrist rotation bearing of an Apollo 16 pressure glove worn only in the spacecraft and one worn only for extravehicular activity on the lunar surface. The results suggest either that the bearing prevented entry of lunar dust, or that dust was not sufficiently abrasive to damage the bearing, or both...|$|R

However, as design reference missions mature, the risks of using heritage hardware have highlighted the need for developing robust new glove technologies. To address the technology gap, the NASA Game-Changing Technology group provided start-up funding for the High Performance EVA Glove (HPEG) Project {{in the spring of}} 2012. The overarching goal of the HPEG Project is to develop a robust glove design that increases human performance during EVA and creates pathway for future implementation of emergent technologies, with specific aims of increasing pressurized mobility to 60 % of barehanded capability, increasing the durability by 100 %, and decreasing the potential of gloves to cause injury during use. The HPEG Project focused initial efforts on identifying potential new technologies and benchmarking the performance of current state of the art gloves to identify trends in design and fit leading to establish standards and metrics against which emerging technologies can be assessed at both the component and assembly levels. The first of the benchmarking tests evaluated the quantitative mobility performance and subjective fit of four prototype gloves developed by Flagsuit LLC, Final Frontier Designs, LLC Dover, and David Clark Company as compared to the Phase VI. All of the companies were asked to design and fabricate gloves to the same set of NASA provided hand measurements (which corresponded to a single size of Phase Vi glove) and focus their efforts on improving mobility in the metacarpal phalangeal and carpometacarpal joints.

The overarching goal of the HPEG Element is to develop a robust glove design that increases human performance during EVA and creates pathway for implementation of emergent technologies, with specific aims of increasing pressurized mobility to 60 % of barehanded capability, increasing the durability in on-pristine environments, and decreasing the potential of gloves to cause injury during use. The HPEG Element focused initial efforts on developing quantifiable and repeatable methodologies for assessing glove performance with respect to mobility, injury potential, thermal conductivity, and abrasion resistance. The team used these methodologies to establish requirements against which emerging technologies and glove designs can be assessed at both the component and assembly levels. The mobility performance testing methodology was an early focus for the HPEG team as it stems from collaborations between the SSA Development team and the JSC Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) that began investigating new methods for suited mobility and fit early in the Constellation Program. The combined HPEG and ABF team used lessons learned from the previous efforts as well as additional reviews of methodologies in physical and occupational therapy arenas to develop a protocol that assesses gloved range of motion, strength, dexterity, tactility, and fit in comparative quantitative terms and also provides qualitative insight to direct hardware design iterations. The protocol was evaluated using five experienced test subjects wearing the EMU pressurized to 4. 3 psid with three different glove configurations. The results of the testing are presented to illustrate where the protocol is and is not valid for benchmark comparisons.

40|$|With the {{new vision}} of space travel aimed at {{traveling}} back to the Moon and eventually to Mars, NASA is designing a new spacesuit glove. The {{purpose of this study}} was to baseline hand strength while wearing the current <b>Extravehicular</b> Activity (EVA) <b>glove,</b> the Phase VI. By varying the pressure in the glove, hand strength could be characterized as a function of spacesuit pressure. This finding is of extreme importance when evaluating missions that require varying suit pressures associated with different operations within NASA's current human spaceflight program, Constellation. This characterization fed directly into the derivation of requirements for the next EVA glove. This study captured three types of maximum hand strength: grip, lateral pinch, and pulp- 2 pinch. All three strengths were measured under varying pressures and compared to a bare-hand condition. The resulting standardized data was reported as a percentage of the bare-hand strength. The first wave of tests was performed while the subjects, four female and four male, were wearing an Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) suit supported by a suit stand. This portion of the test collected data from the barehand, suited unpressurized, and suited pressurized (4. 3 psi) conditions. In addition, the effects of the Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment (TMG) on hand strength were examined, with the suited unpressurized and pressurized cases tested with and without a TMG. It was found that, when pressurized and with the TMG, the Phase VI glove reduced applied grip strength to a little more than half of the subject s bare-hand strength. The lateral pinch strength remained relatively constant while the pulp- 2 pinch strength actually increased with pressure. The TMG was found to decrease maximum applied grip strength by an additional 10 % for both pressurized and unpressurized cases, while the pinch strengths saw little to no change. In developing requirements based on human subjects, it is important to attempt to derive results that encompass the variation within the entire population. The current EMU does not accommodate humans at the extremes of the anthropometric spectrum. To account for this and to ensure that these requirements cover the population, another phase of testing will be conducted in a differential pressure glove box. This phase will focus on smaller females and very large males that do not have a properly fitted EMU suit. Instead, they would wear smaller or larger gloves and be tested in the glove box as a means to compare and contrast their strength capabilities against the EMU accommodated hand size subjects. The glove box s ability to change pressures easily will also allow for a wider range of glove pressures to be tested. Compared to the data collected on the subjects wearing the EMU suit, it is expected that there will be similar ratios to bare-hand. It is recommended that this topic be sent to the Physical Ergonomics Board for review...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades the number of human space {{missions}} has increased significantly. In many of these missions, astronauts are sent to space in order to carry out some specific tasks like installation of different units or parts {{to the international space}} station and/or repair and maintenance of its different parts. In order to do these tasks, astronauts have to go outside of the spacecraft. All the activities that astronauts perform outside of the spacecraft are called Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA). To do EVA, astronauts have to be protected from dangerous condition of space. Some outstanding elements that distinguish the space environment and make it dangerous are radiation, zero pressure and micrometeoroids. These elements are very harmful for human being and in order to protect human body from this harsh condition, astronauts have to wear a specific suit when they go out of the spacecraft to do EVA. Astronaut' space suit is designed to protect astronauts from this harsh environment. The thickness of a spacesuit is approximately 3 / 16 inches (4. 8 mm) and it is fabricated by sewing and cementing 11 layers of different materials. Moreover, some metal parts are used to join different parts of the suit together. In addition, the spacesuit has to be pressurized internally in order to compensate the vacuum of the space and keep astronaut alive. This heavy, thick and multilayer suit prevents astronauts moving their body easily. This is also true for the astronauts' gloves. Due to the bulk and stiffness of this <b>glove,</b> so called <b>Extravehicular</b> Activity (EVA) <b>glove,</b> many problems occur during their missions outside the spacecraft. Hand fatigue, dexterity reduction of the fingers and consequently decrease of possible EVA hours are some of these problems. Several solutions have already been proposed to solve the problem. One approach tries to decrease this stiffness by adopting a suit with Mechanical Counter Pressure (MCP) instead of gas (oxygen) pressure. Other solutions attempt to overcome the existing stiffness of the gloves by means of external devices such as hand exoskeletons which support human fingers during flexion. Here a comprehensive research regarding the second solution is performed. In other words, overcoming the stiffness of the astronauts EVA glove by means of an external device is investigated. Therefore, in the first chapter the problem is explained completely and in the second chapter the possible solutions are evaluated. State of the art in this field is also discussed in this chapter. The main stream of discussion starts in chapter three. Evaluation of the EVA glove effects on the hand performance is explained in this chapter followed by measuring the stiffness of the EVA glove in chapter four. Study of the kinematics of the finger joints is covered in chapter five. In chapter six, a test bed is designed and realized to simulate the stiffness of the EVA glove and finally design of two compatible structures for this application is explained in chapter seve...|$|R
