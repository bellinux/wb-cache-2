The suspensions were subjected to a linear temperature increase from 40 to 95 degrees C in 14 min, a <b>holding</b> <b>step</b> of 40 min at 95 degrees C, a cooling step (7 min) with a linear temperature decrease to 50 degrees C, and a final <b>holding</b> <b>step</b> at 50 degrees C (13 min). Potassium iodate (1. 18 and 1. 77 mu mol/g protein) and potassium bromate (1. 52 and 15. 2 mu mol/g protein) decreased RVA viscosities in the <b>holding</b> <b>step</b> and increased sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) protein extractabilities suggesting a greater heat resistance and decreased gliadin-glutenin cross-linking. In contrast, {{in the presence of}} DTT (1. 65 and 3. 30 mu mol/g protein) RVA viscosity increased at lower temperatures and lowered SDS extractabilities. It is postulated that low concentrations of reducing agent facilitate gliadin-glutenin cross-linking during heating while oxidants hinder gluten polymerization due to decreased levels of free sulphydryl groups and less flexibility of the glutenin chains.

Above 80 degrees C, the RVA viscosity steadily increased with longer holding times while the gliadin and glutenin extractabilities decreased. Their reduced extractability in 60 % ethanol showed that gamma-gliadins were more affected after heating than alpha-gliadins and omega-gliadins. Enrichment of wheat gluten in either gliadin or glutenin showed that both gliadin and glutenin are necessary for the initial viscosity in the RVA profile.

The process which involves an additional <b>holding</b> <b>step</b> and potentials for saving energy was investigated on a pilot plant {{on the basis of}} which a design is proposed for industrial applications. The process was used in order to produce full-fat soy flour and maize germ with long shelf life and improved nutritive and organoleptic qualities. Antitrypsin factors, lipoxygenase and lipase could be inactivated with no damage to available lysine. Overheating not only caused damage to available lysine but also made the products more prone to rancidity possibly by causing destruction of natural antioxidants. The process caused protein solubility and dispersibility to fall and starch (in maize germ) to gelatinize. Water absorption of maize germ also increased. In soybeans, urease was found to be a good indicator of the extent of inactivation of antitrypsin factors, while lipoxygenase was found more heat sensitive than urease and antitrypsin factors. For evaluating storage stability, in addition to measuring peroxide value and % free fatty acids, sensory analysis was also carried out. The process was further applied for treating soybeans prior to oil extraction. It was concluded that the quality of the crude oil obtained from the pretreated beans in terms of oxidation products, free fatty acids and nonhydratable phospholipids was such that the alkali treatment step in the refining process could be circumvented. The improved quality of the crude oil was attributed to the inactivation of phospholipase D, lipoxygenase and lipase. The residual defatted flakes showed low levels of trypsin inhibitor activity and could be used directly as food or feed. Finally, the involvement of phospholipase D in the hydrolysis of phospholipids and formation of nonhydratable phospholipids in soybeans was elucidated by radio(chemical) methods, as well as thin layer chromatography and densitometry.

40|$|Wheat gluten {{proteins}} {{can form}} a continuous network that gives wheat dough its unique visco-elastic properties essential for bread making. They are classically divided into monomeric gliadin and polymeric glutenin. While gliadin provides viscosity to dough, glutenin {{is responsible for}} dough strength and elasticity. Gliadins are soluble in alcohol-water media, and these monomeric wheat proteins contain only intramolecular disulfide (SS) bonds. Glutenin is a heterogeneous mixture of SS linked polymers with a largely unknown polymer structure. Although the bread making process is of enormous importance to bread quality, only {{little is known about}} the physico-chemical changes of gluten during bread making itself. While they play a decisive role during bread baking, information on heat-induced changes in gluten is scarce and the mechanisms that ultimately result in the functionality of the final product are not completely understood. The aim of this thesis was to deliver insight in gluten polymerisation during thermal treatment in general and during the bread making process in particular. A model system was developed to study gluten proteins during hydrothermal treatment. The rapid visco analyser (RVA) was used to measure rheological behaviour in gluten-in-water suspensions upon applying temperature profiles. Temperature and length of the holding phase both affected RVA viscosity and protein extractability. The formation of SS linked polymers caused a viscosity rise in the RVA profile. Size exclusion and reversed phase HPLC showed that increasing the temperature (up to 95 °C) mainly decreased glutenin extractability. Holding at 95 °C resulted in polymerisation of both gliadin and glutenin. At temperatures exceeding 90 °C, the RVA viscosity steadily increased with longer holding times while the gliadin and glutenin extractabilities decreased. Their extractability in 60 % ethanol revealed that heating affected γ-gliadins more than α- and ω-gliadins. Enrichment of wheat gluten in either gliadin or glutenin showed that both gliadin and glutenin were necessary for the initial viscosity in the RVA profile. The levels of free sulfhydryl (SH) groups decreased markedly between 70 °C and 80 °C and when holding the temperature at 95 °C. To alter the level of SH groups during hydrothermal treatment, redox agents were added to gluten-in-water suspensions at room temperature, at 90 °C and after 15 min at 95 °C. Simultaneously, the RVA viscosity was monitored. Addition of potassium iodate and potassium bromate at the start of RVA analysis decreased RVA viscosities in the <b>holding</b> <b>step</b> and increased protein extractabilities suggesting a greater heat resistance and decreased gliadin-glutenin cross-linking. In contrast, addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) at room temperature increased RVA viscosity at lower temperatures and lowered protein extractabilities. DTT decreased maximal RVA viscosity as well as the levels of extractable α- and γ-gliadin after heat treatment. The decrease was independent of the time of addition during hydrothermal treatment. In contrast, potassium iodate increased the levels of extractable α- and γ-gliadin. Its impact was less pronounced when it was added at later times during RVA analysis. A SH blocking agent (N-ethylmaleimide) added at room temperature to the gluten suspension, decreased RVA viscosity at 95 °C and increased the extractabilities of glutenin and α- and γ-gliadin after hydrothermal treatment. Subsequent addition at 90 °C of a reducing agent (glutathione) recovered the control RVA profile and restored the control protein extractabilities after RVA analysis. This shows the importance of both heat-induced gliadin-glutenin reactions for gluten viscosity and of free SH groups for the polymerisation of gluten proteins. It is postulated that low concentrations of reducing agent facilitate gliadin-glutenin cross-linking during heating while oxidants hinder gluten polymerisation due to decreased levels of free SH groups and less flexibility of the glutenin chains. A model explaining gliadin-glutenin polymerisation through a SH-SS exchange mechanism and demonstrating the effects of redox agents was put forward. Interactions between starch and gluten may influence bread quality parameters. To evaluate gluten extractability in the presence of starch, RVA analysis was performed on a gluten-starch mixture. The presence of starch had no influence on gluten extractability during hydrothermal treatment in the RVA. The treatment of gluten proteins with starch in the RVA system was compared to that of gluten-starch bread making, which itself served as a model for wheat flour bread making. The temperature profile used in the model RVA system resembled the profile that proteins in bread crumb were exposed to during baking of gluten-starch bread. The changes in protein extractability during bread making were similar as in RVA analysis with, at temperatures below 90 °C, mainly a decrease in glutenin and, at temperatures exceeding 90 °C, mainly a decrease in gliadin extractabilities. γ-Gliadins were more affected during baking than α-gliadins. Only a limited effect on ω-gliadin extractability was observed. Given the analogies between the results in the model system and those in gluten-starch bread making, we postulate glutenin polymerisation through oxidation and SH-SS interchange reactions and gliadin-glutenin cross-linking through SH-SS interchange reactions. Although the conditions of dilute starch-gluten-water suspensions in the RVA were quite different from the concentrated starch-gluten-water systems in baked products, the similarities in temperature conditions and gluten extractabilities suggest that the model obtained from the RVA system can be instrumental in understanding gluten behaviour in concentrated food systems, such as bread making. To impact gluten properties and to study gliadin-glutenin interactions in a real bread making process, redox agents were added to wheat flour. In control bread making, mixing increased glutenin extractability. The levels of SDS extractable glutenin decreased during fermentation and then further in the oven. Those of extractable α- and γ-gliadin also decreased during bread baking due to gliadin-glutenin polymerisation. Neither oxidizing nor reducing agents had an impact on glutenin extractabilities after mixing. The redox additives did not affect ω-gliadin extractabilities during bread making due to their lack of cysteine residues. Potassium iodate and potassium bromate increased both α- and γ-gliadin extractabilities during baking. Increasing concentrations of glutathione decreased levels of extractable α- and γ-gliadins during baking. This confirmed that, during baking, glutenin and gliadin polymerize through heat-induced SH-SS exchange reactions. Moreover, its was demonstrated that, oxidizing agents, besides their effect on dough rheology and hence, bread volume, hinder gliadin-glutenin linking during baking, while glutathione increases the degree of covalent gliadin to glutenin linking. The redox agents potassium bromate and glutathione not only affected dough properties and gluten polymerisation during baking, they also had an effect on bread density and crumb structure and texture during storage. The differences in crumb structure could be attributed to differences in dough properties. More extensible dough, as is the case for bread with glutathion in this study, led to more stable gas cells and higher bread volume. The differences in crumb firmness during storage between the breads with and without additives could not be attributed to differences in amylopectin retrogradation enthalpies, but were probably caused by a different bread density. Although this study did not demonstrate a direct influence of gluten proteins in bread firming, the indirect effect of gluten proteins on bread firming through their effect on bread volume is of paramount importance for the consumer’s perception of bread freshness. status: publishe...|$|E
