5|$|Henry had a {{problematic}} relationship with Louis VII of France throughout the 1150s. The {{two men had}} already clashed over Henry's succession to Normandy and the remarriage of Eleanor, and the relationship was not repaired. Louis invariably attempted to take {{the moral high ground}} in respect to Henry, capitalising on his reputation as a crusader and circulating rumours about his rival's behaviour and character. Henry had greater resources than Louis, however, particularly after taking England, and Louis was far less <b>dynamic</b> <b>in</b> resisting Angevin power than he had been earlier in his reign. The disputes between the two drew in other powers across the region, including Thierry, the Count of Flanders, who signed a military alliance with Henry, albeit with a clause that prevented the count from being forced to fight against Louis, his feudal lord. Further south, Theobald V, the Count of Blois, an enemy of Louis, became another early ally of Henry. The resulting military tensions and the frequent face-to-face meetings to attempt to resolve them has led historian Jean Dunbabin to liken the situation to the period of the Cold War in Europe in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In 2036, FBI Agents Simon Foster (Henry Ian Cusick) and Henrietta 'Etta' Bishop (Georgina Haig) {{recover the}} body of Walter Bishop (John Noble), Walter having purposefully encased himself and his team in amber shortly after the Observer takeover. Though {{they are able to}} release him from the amber, they find that he has {{suffered}} memory damage and lacks the mental capacity to build a strange device of his own design. Simon and Etta talk to Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), learning that Walter had William Bell remove a piece of his brain some time in the past, which she postulates could be used to heal Walter's brain now. However, the piece is still in storage in the old Massive Dynamic facility on the main island of New York City, tightly controlled by Observers who can read their thoughts, making its recovery difficult. They are able {{to make it to the}} vault in Massive <b>Dynamic,</b> <b>in</b> part due to the inability of the Observers to read Etta's mind, and successfully restore Walter's memories. They are, however, unaware that they have alerted Fringe division—still led by Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick)—and the Observers to their presence; a coordinated team, instructed to shoot on sight, is dispatched.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Our study investigates <b>dynamic</b> {{capabilities}} <b>in</b> micro-organizations and in {{this paper}} we particularly focus upon understanding the links between entrepreneurial learning and <b>dynamic</b> capabilities <b>in</b> such organizations. Prior Work: Although there are a small number of empirical studies into <b>dynamic</b> capabilities <b>in</b> which microorganizations form {{at least part of the}} research context, such research remains rare. This is despite the potential theoretical and empirical insights that could be realised from such research. Dynamic capabilities can also benefit organizational performance (Helfat et al, 2007), and therefore, better understanding of <b>dynamic</b> capabilities <b>in</b> micro-organizations could benefit practitioners in such organizations. Approach: We look to gain understanding of <b>dynamic</b> capabilities <b>in</b> three micro-organizations based in the United Kingdom by adopting a qualitative research approach. We utilize narrative interviewing, unstructured interviewing, and qualitative shadowing. In particular, data drawn from eleven interviews with owner-managers of the three organizations inform the findings presented within this paper. Results: The analysis of the data illuminates that the self-concept of owner-managers, which can result from their entrepreneurial learning, can be a key micro-foundation of <b>dynamic</b> capabilities <b>in</b> the organizations studied. Interestingly, our findings also suggest that in some cases part of the owner-manager’s self-concept can also be an outcome of entrepreneurial learning stemming from the owner-manager’s experience of the enactment of dynamic capabilities. Implications: The links between dynamic capabilities and self-concept highlighted within this paper offer new contributions to dynamic capabilities literature. These findings advance our understanding of <b>dynamic</b> capabilities <b>in</b> the micro-organization context by shedding light on how the entrepreneurial learning and self-concept of owner-managers can link to the development of micro-organizations. Value: Not only do our findings advance our theoretical understanding of dynamic capabilities and how they relate to entrepreneurial learning, but they could also inform policy and practice aimed at the development and enactment of <b>dynamic</b> capabilities <b>in</b> micro-organizations...|$|R
