40|$|Digital textile {{printing}} is over-taking the printing industry with eco-friendly processes {{and ability to}} produce short runs. With its rapid growth, {{there is a constant}} need to reproduce consistent colors throughout different print runs and crucial for these colors to perform well and up hold under certain conditions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to research the colorfastness digitally printed <b>reactive</b> and pigment <b>inks</b> printed on cotton fabrics. Fabric swatches printed using the <b>reactive</b> and pigment <b>inks</b> were tested according to the AATCC standards for laundering, crocking, light, and perspiration. The digital {{textile printing}} industry has slowly started transitioning from printing with <b>reactive</b> <b>inks</b> to primarily pigment inks. Printing with pigment inks is more cost effective and cheaper than <b>reactive</b> <b>inks</b> and has had a large impact on the printing industry. While <b>reactive</b> <b>inks</b> are printed on natural fibers, such as cotton and silk pigment inks, have the ability to be printed on natural and synthetic fibers. To test the textiles, a Mimaki TX 2 1600 digital textile printer was used to print the <b>reactive</b> <b>ink</b> samples while an outside printing company was used to print the pigment ink samples. One hundred and twenty-eight test samples sizes 2 ”x 6 ”printed with a red, blue, and green geometric pattern were tested. Both the pigment and reactive samples were testing according to the AATCC standards for colorfastness to laundering, crocking, light, and perspiration. Using a spectrophotometer, the samples were tested and the CIELAB color and ΔE* color change were obtained. The samples were also tested using the AATCC gray scale and 9 -step chromatic transference scale. Using the Wilcoxin rank sum test the pigment and reactive samples were compared to record any statistical significance in color change. The results revealed that the colors printed using pigment inks perform better than <b>reactive</b> <b>inks.</b> Pigment inks experienced much less color loss than the <b>reactive</b> <b>inks</b> in laundering, crocking, and perspiration. Light had little to no impact on the color of both the reactive and pigment samples.

It is a process of printing on textiles and garments using specialized or modified inkjet technology. Inkjet printing on fabric is also possible with an inkjet printer by using fabric sheets with a removable paper backing. Today, major inkjet technology manufacturers can offer specialized products designed for direct printing on textiles, not only for sampling but also for bulk production. Since the early 1990s, inkjet technology and specially developed water-based ink (known as dye-sublimation or disperse direct ink) have made it possible to print directly onto polyester fabric. This is mainly related to visual communication in retail and brand promotion (flags, banners and other point of sales applications).

Photosensitization in a biological system such as the epidermis is an oxidative or other chemical change in a molecule in response to light-induced excitation of endogenous or exogenously-delivered molecules within the tissue. Photo-oxidation can also occur in the plant itself, resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species, free radical damage and eventual DNA degradation.

Combining inkjet printing with high-resolution multiphoton polymerization (MPP) {{enables us to}} generate branched, tubular systems with diameters << 1 mm. New synthetic polymers were tailored to match {{the needs of the}} technical building process and the elastic properties of blood vessels. The polymers were biofunctionalized to achieve a close coating with endothelial cells (ECs). Experimental Methods: Based on numerical simulations, branched tubular scaffolds were fabricated by combining inkjet printing and MPP. Precursor polymers, cross linking agent, photo initiators and solvent additives were optimized to yield photo <b>reactive</b> <b>inks</b> with customizd E-moduli. Crosslinked polymers were modified with derivatized heparin and RGD and analyzed by XPS and colorimetric methods. Viability, proliferation, functionality of primary human microvascular ECs on the substrates was determined, using several assays and immunocytological stainings. Results: A set-up for integrating inkjet printing and MPP has been designed with which branched vessel scaffolds have been fabricated. The diameter of the tubes can range between 20 µm and several millimeters. Material compositions have been developed to achieve E-Moduli of 2 - 2000 MPa after crosslinking, the lower are similar to natural blood vessels. Suitable aftertreatment ensured biocompatibility of the processed polymers, thereafter thio-heparin and RGD have been covalently bound on the surface. On these biofunctionalized substrates an increased adhesion, viability and proliferation of ECs has been determined in comparison with unmodified substrates. EC-typical antigene expression has been observed by immunocytological stainings on all substrates.
