5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses {{the whole history}} of a universe— it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E

5|$|In his text, An Unusual Feast: Gumbo and the Complex Brew of Black Religion, author Derek Hicks {{suggest that}} “through gumbo, traditions and values are transmitted.” This quote {{represents}} his larger claim that gumbo does this for African American culture, uniting {{a group of}} people by one very powerful dish. According to Hicks, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> that gumbo is a cultural and historical food in the black community, but that it continues to foster that community through its flavors, colors and eating methods, which are usually in large groups where it can be shared among many people.|$|E
5|$|Malaria <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> {{a disease}} {{commonly}} associated with poverty: some evidence {{suggests that it is}} also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development. Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was {{a major factor in the}} slow economic development of the American southern states.|$|E
5|$|Archie is {{visited by}} Peggy and he pleads {{with her to}} come home to him as she is the woman he loves. Peggy says she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> a sweet and {{innocent}} old lady and that he has no idea whom he is messing with. She tells Archie if he does not leave the pub that night he will regret every cruel and evil act he has ever done. He tells her that unless she returns he will have the pub converted to flats. He then becomes emotional as he tells Peggy that he will be waiting for her as she walks out on him. Bradley walks in and punches Archie in the face twice but accidentally punches the bar as well, cutting his hand. He tells Archie to stay away from his girlfriend Stacey because she has said Archie raped her three months previously, and Bradley leaves. As Archie picks up his snowglobe from the floor, the bust of Queen Victoria is pushed from the bar and hits him on the head.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> Quatermass who is {{interested}} in what happened to Carroon and his crewmates; journalists such as James Fullalove (Paul Whitsun-Jones) and Scotland Yard's Inspector Lomax (Ian Colin) are also keen to hear his story. Carroon is abducted {{by a group of}} foreign agents whose government wants the information they believe he has obtained about travelling in space. It is clear that there is something critically wrong: he appears to have absorbed the consciousness of the other two crew members, and is slowly mutating into a plant-like alien organism.|$|E
5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction {{of the novel is}} that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for what goes on in people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> Bang's portrayal of a bygone provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Unni, Babu, Shaji, Shenoy, and MLA meet atop an {{apartment}} building to discuss {{the circumstances surrounding the}} gold they smuggled into Kozhikode and lost to an ambush while in transit from the airport. They suspect Ramesh is involved since he disappeared right after the incident. They devise a plan to kidnap Jayanthi in order to force Ramesh to return the gold. An unsuspecting Raju and Jayanthi become the targets of their surprise attack in which Jayanthi is rendered unconscious. Raju draws his concealed handgun and foils the kidnapping by shooting at his assailants. He collects the unconscious Jayanthi and transports her to a safe place. When she awakens, she finds herself surrounded by strangers. She also discovers that Raju <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> a taxi driver rather he is part of an investigation to find Ramesh and the missing gold. Raju explains to her that Ramesh was involved in the smuggling, and has since become the target of the criminals. Jayanthi returns to Rekha's home for safety, and Chandrasekharan begins investigating Raju who, in a turn of events, has raised suspicion.|$|E

5|$|The earthly authority, whose {{words and}} actions should be cleaved to both in life (agriculture) and death (funerals), is called to minaa (an aluk priest). Aluk <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> a belief system; it is a {{combination}} of law, religion, and habit. Aluk governs social life, agricultural practices, and ancestral rituals. The details of aluk may vary from one village to another. One common law is the requirement that death and life rituals be separated. Torajans believe that performing death rituals might ruin their corpses if combined with life rituals. The two rituals are equally important. During the time of the Dutch missionaries, Christian Torajans were prohibited from attending or performing life rituals, but were allowed to perform death rituals. Consequently, Toraja's death rituals are still practised today, while life rituals have diminished.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones allow {{players to}} freely explore the game world, which is {{typically}} {{on the scale}} of an entire city. Some games base their level design on real world cities, such as London, New York City, and Los Angeles. Players are usually able to navigate by vehicle or on foot. Some games put greater emphasis on leaping, climbing, and even swimming. Exploring the world <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> necessary to complete objectives, but also to gain valuable items, weapons, and vehicles. Different parts of the game world may be controlled by different enemy factions, who will attempt to stop the player in a variety of ways. However, more recent games in this genre allow players to acquire their own territory. The freedom of navigating a huge game world may be overwhelming or confusing for new players. Game designers {{have come up with a}} variety of navigational aids to solve this problem. A mini-map feature is common, while Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto IV go so far as to offer a GPS service. Games without these navigation tools are sometimes criticized as confusing.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that were not considered vital, upgraded the telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years ago, and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades will also help Hubble to see deeper into the universe, and farther into the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang. Hubble's importance to science <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> seen in the dramatic images it provides, but also in the volume of work it has generated – an average of fourteen scientific articles are published each week based on data gathered from the telescope. Officially, the upgrades should extend Hubble's life through 2014, but Hubble Space Telescope Senior Scientist David Leckrone noted prior to the mission that if all of the mission's objectives were successful, the telescope could easily last longer than that. The next large telescope scheduled to be launched is the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018, which is infrared-only, so to have Hubble, which has ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared capabilities, still operational after 2018 would be of great benefit to the scientific community.|$|E
