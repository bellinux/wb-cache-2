5|$|Genome : The Liliaceae {{include the}} species {{with the largest}} genome size within the angiosperms, Fritillaria assyriaca (1C=127.4pg), while Tricyrtis macropoda is as small as 4.25pg. Chromosome numbers vary by genus. Some genera like Calochortus (x=6-10), Prosartes (6,8,9,11), Scoliopus (7,8), Streptopus (8, 27) and Tricyrtis (12-13) <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> and {{variable}} number of chromosomes while subfamily Lilioideae have a larger and more stable chromosome number (12) as have the Medeoleae (7).|$|E

5|$|Males {{and females}} {{of all ages}} can be {{distinguished}} by {{the position of the}} two round genital openings or gonopores. In females, they are at the bases of the third pair of pereiopods, while in males they are {{at the base of the}} fifth (last) pereiopods, furthest from the head and the closest to the abdomen. Mature females <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> claw on the fifth pereiopod, and enlarged pleopods.|$|E
5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E
5|$|All known {{isotopes}} of curium are radioactive and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{critical mass}} for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. They predominantly emit α-particles, {{and the heat}} released in this process {{can serve as a}} heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, but this application is hindered by the scarcity, high cost, and radioactivity of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238Pu radionuclide for power sources in artificial pacemakers. It served as the α-source in the alpha particle X-ray spectrometers installed on several space probes, including the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity Mars rovers and the Philae lander on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to analyze the composition and structure of the surface.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the olfactory bulb, but they do have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|E
5|$|Chalukyan temples {{fall into}} two {{categories}} – the first being temples with a common mantapa (a colonnaded hall) and two shrines (known as dvikuta), and the second being temples with one mantapa and a single shrine (ekakuta). Both kinds of temples have two or more entrances giving access to the main hall. This format differs from both the designs of the northern Indian temples, which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> closed mantapa leading to the shrine and the southern Indian temples which generally have a large, open, columned mantapa.|$|E
5|$|Considered {{the most}} {{specialized}} member of its family, the tasselled wobbegong's ornate coloration and complex dermal fringe grants it excellent camouflage, {{while it is}} probably a slower swimmer than related species. It is solitary and spends {{most of the day}} lying motionless inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled up. Individual sharks <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> home range, containing several preferred resting spots that are used repeatedly. This species becomes more active at night, swimming onto the reef to hunt.|$|E

5|$|Fluorine's first {{ionization}} energy is third-highest among all elements, behind helium and neon, which complicates {{the removal of}} electrons from neutral fluorine atoms. It also has a high electron affinity, second only to chlorine, and tends to capture an electron to become isoelectronic with the noble gas neon; it has the highest electronegativity of any element. Fluorine atoms <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> covalent radius of around 60picometers, {{similar to those of}} its period neighbors oxygen and neon.|$|E
5|$|In adults {{short term}} use of nasal decongestants may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> benefit. Antihistamines may improve {{symptoms}} {{in the first}} day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnally active, {{the prickly}} shark rests {{during the day}} in deeper {{offshore}} waters and performs a diel migration to shallower inshore waters at dusk. Individual sharks <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> home range and tend to remain within a given local area. This species consumes a variety of bony and cartilaginous fishes, and cephalopods. Since it moves slowly, it may use suction to capture prey. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing sizable litters. The prickly shark is not known to be dangerous to humans and has minimal economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial deepwater fisheries, which are expanding and may potentially threaten its population. Thus, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened.|$|E

5|$|Silkies {{appear in}} two {{distinct}} varieties: bearded and non-bearded. Bearded Silkies {{have an extra}} muff of feathers under the beak area that covers the earlobes. They also are separated according to color. Colors of Silkie recognized for competitive showing include black, blue, buff, grey, partridge, and white. Alternative hues, such as cuckoo, lavender, red, and splash also exist. The standards of perfection call for all Silkies to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> walnut-colored comb, dark wattles, and turquoise-blue earlobes. In addition to these defining characteristics, Silkies have five toes on each foot. Other breeds which exhibit this rare trait include the Dorking, Faverolles, and Sultan.|$|E
5|$|Species in {{this order}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> {{inflexible}} disc and 6–20 long, thin arms, which they use for suspension feeding. They {{have a single}} series of marginal plates, a fused ring of disc plates, a reduced number of aboral plates, crossed pedicellariae, and several series of long spines on the arms. They live almost exclusively in deep-sea habitats, although a few live in shallow waters in the Antarctic. In some species, the tube feet have rounded tips and lack suckers.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Judaism in Turkey {{goes back to}} the Romaniote Jews of Anatolia who have been present since at least the 5th century BC. They built ancient places of worship such as the Sardis Synagogue in Lydia and the Priene Synagogue in Ionia. The Sephardi Jews who were {{expelled}} from the Iberian peninsula and southern Italy {{under the control of the}} Spanish Empire were welcomed into the Ottoman Empire between the late-15th and mid-16th centuries. Despite emigration during the 20th century, modern-day Turkey continues to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> Jewish population. At present, there are around 26,000 Jews in Turkey, the vast majority of whom are Sephardi.|$|E

5|$|There {{are male}} (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers (unisexual flowers) {{on a single}} plant (monoecious), and these grow singly, {{appearing}} from the leaf axils. Flowers have five fused yellow to orange petals (the corolla) and a green bell-shaped calyx. Male flowers in Cucurbitaceae generally have five stamens, but in Cucurbita there are only three, and their anthers are joined together so that {{there appears to be}} one. Female flowers have thick pedicels, and an inferior ovary with 3–5 stigmas that each have two lobes. The female flowers of C.argyrosperma and C.ficifolia have larger corollas than the male flowers. Female flowers of C.pepo <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> calyx, but the calyx of C.moschata male flowers is comparatively short.|$|E
5|$|This bird is glossy {{black with}} a wide fork to the tail. Adults usually <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> white spot {{at the base of}} the gape. The iris is dark brown (not crimson as in the similar ashy drongo). The sexes cannot be told apart in the field. Juveniles are {{brownish}} and may have some white barring or speckling towards the belly and vent, and can be mistaken for the white-bellied drongo. First-year birds have white tips to the feathers of the belly, while second-years have these white-tipped feathers restricted to the vent.|$|E
5|$|Agungs {{also play}} a major role in agung orchestras—ensembles {{composed}} of large hanging, suspended or held, knobbed gongs which act as drones without any accompanying melodic instrument like a kulintang. Such orchestras are prevalent among Indigenous Philippine groups (Bagobo, Bilaan, Bukidon, Hanunoo, Magsaka, Manabo, Mangyan, Palawan, Subanun, Suludnon, T’boli, Tagakaolu, Tagbanwa and the Tiruray), regions in Kalimantan and Indonesia (Iban, Modang, Murut) and Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysia (Bidayuh, Iban, Kadazan-Dusun, Kajan, Kayan), places where agung orchestras take precedence over kulintang-like orchestras. The composition and tuning of these orchestras vary widely from one group to another. For instance, the Hanunoo of Mindoro <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> agung ensemble consisting of only two light gongs played by two musicians on the floor in a simple duple rhythm while the Manobo have an ensemble (called an ahong) consisting of 10 small agungs hung vertically on a triangular frame. It includes three musicians: one standing up, playing the melody, and the rest sitting. The ahong is divided by purpose, with the higher-pitched gongs (kaantuhan) carrying the melody, three to four lower-pitched gongs (gandingan) playing melodic ostinato figures, and the lowest-pitched gong (bandil) setting the tempo.|$|E
