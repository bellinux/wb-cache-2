25|$|Whereas a {{national}} recession is identified by two quarters of decline, defining a global recession is more difficult, because a Developing country {{is expected to}} have a higher GDP growth than a Developed country. According to the IMF, the real GDP growth of the emerging and developing countries is on an uptrend and that of advanced economies is on a <b>downtrend</b> since late 1980s. The world growth is projected to slow from 5% in 2007 to 3.75% in 2008 and to just over 2% in 2009. Downward revisions in GDP growth vary across regions. Among the most affected are commodity exporters, and countries with acute external financing and liquidity problems. Countries in East Asia (including China) have suffered smaller declines because their financial situations are more robust. They have benefited from falling commodity prices and they have initiated a shift toward macroeconomic policy easing.|$|E
25|$|The {{ratio of}} {{testosterone}} to cortisol can both increase and decrease during resistance training, depending on intensity of exercise. A study comparing {{young and old}} subjects showed acute increases in GH and testosterone for both, although the latter increased less in older men. Testosterone rises in late hours of sleep after anaerobic exercise. Androgen receptor expression increases with acute exercise in correlation to free testosterone. When comparing {{men and women in}} the 30, 50 and 70 year age groups, young and middle aged men showed increased testosterone after exercise, with the latter also having increased cortisol. Elderly men showed no change. Other studies have also shown with age there is a <b>downtrend</b> of testosterone and attenuated growth hormone response. Young men have shown no acute change in testosterone with resistance training, with increase in cortisol and growth hormone depending on intensity. One study in young men showed testosterone acutely stable, with increase in GH and IGF-1. Similarly, a study showed testosterone did not increase in young men, women, and pubescent boys unaccustomed to weight training when corrected for plasma volume. Extreme intensity of strength training may trigger the stress response, resulting in lower testosterone levels, an effect accentuated by energy deprivation. A separate study comparing different ages, however, found no difference in acute testosterone and cortisol levels between groups, but attenuated growth hormone response in the elderly. Acutely, other studies have shown testosterone to increase. In a small group of anaerobically trained athletes, stressful training acutely even decreased serum testosterone and its ratio to cortisol and SHBG, with an increase in LH. With subsequent decompensation, testosterone was stable, but cortisol and SHBG decreased. Another case control showed with intense training followed by rest, testosterone dropped and LH increased initially.|$|E

40|$|Research {{on global}} pitch trends {{has shown that}} {{statements}} and different types of questions in Dutch all display distinct patterns, and suggests that these {{may be influenced by}} the presence of accentual prominence on wh-words and whether syntactic cues to interrogativity are present [11]. This implies that there would be different pitch trends in a language such as Korean which lacks accentual prominence and which does not necessarily have an interrogative syntax in unmarked yes-no questions. We test this implication by comparing the results in [11] with similar statements and question types in Korean, concentrating in this paper on the scaling of L tones. Further, we differentiate between the pitch trends {{towards the end of the}} utterances and those in the rest of the utterance, so as to investigate the contribution of final lowering to the shape of global trends. Results reveal similar <b>downtrends</b> in Korean, providing evidence against the explanation that syntactic and lexical cues to interrogativity directly influence these <b>downtrends.</b> 1...|$|R

We find evidence of bi-directional dynamics during upward, downward and some mixed market movements. However, after adding control variables to our models, only the relationship for the negative components retains its significance; indicating that the Islamic index is the least responsive during bad times.

50|$|Finally, Cardwell {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} positive and negative reversals in the RSI. Reversals are the opposite of divergence. For example, a positive reversal occurs when an uptrend price correction results in a higher low compared to the last price correction, while RSI results in a lower low compared to the prior correction. A negative reversal happens when a <b>downtrend</b> rally results in a lower high compared to the last <b>downtrend</b> rally, but RSI makes a higher high compared to the prior rally.|$|E
50|$|The rising wedge {{pattern is}} {{characterized}} by a chart pattern which forms when the market makes higher highs and higher lows with a contracting range. When this pattern is found in an uptrend, it is considered a reversal pattern, as the contraction of the range indicates that the uptrend is losing strength. When this pattern is found in a <b>downtrend,</b> it is considered a bearish pattern, as the market range becomes narrower into the correction, indicating that the correction is losing strength, and that the resumption of the <b>downtrend</b> is in the making.|$|E

50|$|Mutual fund flows are {{published}} by organizations like Investment Company Institute and TrimTabs. They show that flows generally track the {{overall level of}} the market: investors buy stocks when prices are high, and sell stocks when prices are low. For example, {{in the beginning of}} the 2000s, the largest inflows to stock mutual funds were in early 2000 while the largest outflows were in mid-2002. It is good to note that these mutual fund flows were near the start of a significant bear (<b>downtrending)</b> market and bull (uptrending) market respectively. A similar pattern is repeated near the end of the decade. Chien of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis confirms the correlation showing return-chasing behavior.|$|R

40|$|Soil {{heat content}} (SHC) {{provides}} {{an estimate of}} the integrated effect of changes in the land surface energy balance. It considers the specific heat capacity, soil temperature, and phase changes of soil moisture as a function of depth. In contrast, soil temperature provides a much more limited view of land surface energy flux changes. This is particularly important at high latitudes, which have and are undergoing surface energy flux changes as a result of changes in seasonal variations of snow cover extent (SCE) and hence surface albedo changes, among other factors. Using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface model forced with gridded climate observations, we simulate spatial and temporal variations of SCE and SHC over the pan-Arctic land region for the last half-century. On the basis of the SCE trends derived from NOAA satellite observations in 5 ° latitude bands from April through June for the period 1972 – 2006, we define a snow covered sensitivity zone (SCSZ), a snow covered non-sensitivity zone (SCNZ), and a non-snow covered zone (NSCZ) for North America and Eurasia. We then explore long-term trends in SHC, SCE, and surface air temperature (SAT) and their corresponding correlations in NSCZ, SCSZ and SCNZ for both North America and Eurasia. We find that snow cover <b>downtrends</b> {{have a significant impact on}} SHC changes in SCSZ for North America and Eurasia from April through June. SHC changes in the SCSZ over North America are dominated by <b>downtrends</b> in SCE rather than increasing SAT. Over Eurasia, increasing SAT more strongly affects SHC than in North America. Overall, increasing SAT during late spring and early summer is the dominant factor that has resulted in SHC changes over the pan-Arctic domain, whereas reduced SCE plays a secondary role that is only important in the SCSZ...|$|R

40|$|Financial {{time series}} often exhibit high degrees of {{fluctuation}} which are considered as noise in time series analysis. To remove noise, several lower bounding the Euclidean distance based dimensionality reduction methods are applied.

Therefore, although a number of methods can retain the important points in the financial time series reduction, but, however, they loss the nature of financial time series which consist of several uptrends, <b>downtrends</b> and sideway trends in different resolutions and in the zigzag directions. In this paper, we propose the Zigzag based Perceptually Important Point Identification method to collect those zigzag movement important points. Further, we propose Zigzag based Multiway Search Tree to index these important points. We evaluate our methods in time series dimensionality reduction.

40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} issue of <b>downtrends</b> in {{different}} types of yes/no question in Estonian.

It appears that these differ {{with respect to the}} slope of the fall in prenuclear accents and the step between the final prenuclear and nuclear accent. Tag and unmarked questions show a similar prenuclear slope but differ in the step; kas-questions have a significantly different slope from the other two types. A further comparison is made with statements, revealing that the question type most similar to statements is the kas-question. It is suggested that this is because the questioning particle in the beginning of an utterance signals a question immediately, and thus less intonational marking is needed. The other two types of question are either not marked morphosyntactically at all, or have marking only at the very end, and consequently a larger degree of intonational marking is used for conveying interrogativity...|$|R

50|$|Gann {{watched for}} {{important}} tops and bottoms to form on a daily, weekly, or monthly chart and drew his angles from {{these changes in}} trend. When the trend is up and the price stays in the space above an ascending angle without breaking below it, the market is strong; when the trend is down and the price remains below a descending angle without breaking above it, the market is weak. The market shows its relative strength or weakness according to the angle it is above or below. For example, if the price is above the 2x1 the market has shown itself {{to be much more}} bullish than if it is above the 1x1. In his angles course, Gann argues that when an uptrending price reverses and breaks under an ascending angle, the tendency of the price is to go to the next nearest angle below it; likewise, when a <b>downtrending</b> price reverses and breaks up through a descending angle, the tendency of the price is to go to the next nearest angle above it.|$|R

The hypoglycemic effect produced by liposomes with 10 % biotin-DSPE weaker than that of liposomes with more biotin-DSPE may be as a consequence of relatively weak stability rather than the insufficiency of ligand amount, because DSPE that possesses a high phase transition temperature could reinforce the rigidity of liposomes if more biotin-DSPE was incorporated into lipid bilayer. However, since there was not much difference in the stability of liposomes, increasing the amount of biotin-DSPE is not helpful to the absorption of liposomes, which could also be deduced from the results of hypoglycemic effect using liposomes containing 20 % and 30 % biotin-DSPE that presented similar profiles of blood glucose decline.|$|R
