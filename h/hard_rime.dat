5|$|The {{climate of}} Strandzha is {{influenced}} by the proximity of the Black, Marmara and Aegean seas which clearly distinguishes the local climate from that of the rest of Bulgaria. The region is among the warmest in the country with temperatures rarely falling below 0°C in winter and rising above 24°C in summer due to the cooling effect of the Black Sea. The average temperature drops with the rising elevation in the interior which creates conditions for more frequent and longer-lasting mists, heavier snowfall and earlier frosts. In winter frequent fogs lead to <b>hard</b> <b>rime</b> and the icing of the forests at altitudes above 50.|$|E

The street-lamps flickering in the gusty north-east wind, as if the very gas were contorted with cold; the white-topped houses; the bleak, star-lighted sky; the market people and other early stragglers, trotting to circulate their almost frozen blood; the hospitable light and warmth of the few coffee-shops and public-houses that were open for such customers; the <b>hard,</b> dry, frosty <b>rime</b> with which the air was charged (the wind had already beaten it into every crevice), and which lashed my face like a steel whip.|$|R

Especially when a warm front brings wet snow, {{the surface of the}} tree is colder than the snowflakes, and the latter attach to the tree crown.|$|E

50|$|Soft rime {{formations}} {{have the}} appearance of white ice needles and scales; they are fragile and can be easily shaken off objects.Factors that favour soft rime are small drop size, slow accretion of liquid water, high degree of supercooling, and fast dissipation of latent heat of fusion. The opposite conditions favour ice with higher densities, such as <b>hard</b> <b>rime</b> or clear ice.|$|E
50|$|Rime {{is a type}} of ice {{formed on}} cold objects when drops of water {{crystallize}} on them. This can be observed in foggy weather, when the temperature drops during the night. Soft rime contains a high proportion of trapped air, making it appear white rather than transparent, and giving it a density about one quarter of that of pure ice. <b>Hard</b> <b>rime</b> is comparatively dense.|$|E

50|$|Summer is the driest {{season and}} can {{overcome}} with great frequency 30 °C, reaching sporadically over 35 °C. However, in winter it is frequent that the temperatures fall to 0 °C, producing ice in cloudless nights and snow sporadically. When frost combines with fog, {{that is called}} <b>hard</b> <b>rime,</b> a very characteristic phenomenon of the area, like frost. This northern region of Spain, {{along with the rest}} of the provinces of Castile and Leon, is the coldest region in South Europe. Rainfall follows a very similar pattern to that of the typical Mediterranean climate, reaching between 400 and 600 mm, with a peak during Spring and Autumn. The declining influence of the sea, however, makes it a drier climate than the typical.|$|E
5000|$|The {{climate in}} Reggio Emilia is {{temperate}} continental, with hot rather moist summers (the temperatures can sometimes rise above 35 °C) and fairly rigid winters with frequent frosts (the temperatures can go below -10 °C). Precipitations are evenly distributed all year long, but October, November and April {{are the most}} rainy months, while July and January are the most arid.In the city, you can rarely see snow, even though almost every year there is a period when it's snowing, but due to the rather high temperatures, it does not settle, or if it does, the layer of snow is not very consistent.During autumn and winter it is very common, especially in the areas outside the city, to encounter very thick fog, even though nowadays it is less frequent than in the past. Other meteorological phenomena that one can assist in the area is the <b>hard</b> <b>rime</b> and the freezing rain during winter and hail during summer or rarely during spring. The area is not particular windy and there are ofter days of total calm, especially during the anticyclonic phases in winter, while spring is more ventilated. The most intense winds are the ones blowing from North-Est (Bora) or from South-West (Libeccio). The latter, during its descent from the Northern Apennines, it sometimes tends to become a downslope wind and thus being very dry and hot. In rare and particular conditions, the downwind of the Alps, the Foehn, can reach Reggio Emilia from the North-West. In Reggio Emilia, the average annual high temperature is , the annual low temperature is , and the annual precipitation is 700 mm ...|$|E
40|$|The pile {{of small}} ice {{particles}} is produced when {{the cold air}} containing plenty of small supercooled water droplets collide to an object and the droplets change into ice. Such a phenomenon or its product is called "icing" and the rime, a kind of icing, covering the mountain is widely known as a beautiful creation of nature in the winter. However the chances the icing occures are limitted in Sauthern district in Japan like Nagasaki even in Mt. Unzen famous for the rime because {{the condition of the}} climate to produce the icing is not so frequently satisfied. The present study was conducted to make it possible to see indoor artificial icing throughout the year. In this study cooled wet air of the temperature - 5 to - 10 ℃ was forced to flow through an acrylic resin pipe of 30 mm diameter and 1750 mm length in which a needle and a small branch were mounted as the base the icing grows. Mists from the atomizer was used to wet the cooled air. Using these facilities the relations between the test conditions and the characteristics of icing produced were investigated. The results are as follows; (1) Various types of icing, <b>hard</b> <b>rime,</b> soft rime, glaze and air hoar were produced artificially by controlling the test conditions. (2) The shapes and the grow speed of icing changed with the test conditions and some of the relations between them were clarified. (3) The catch ratio in the present experiment was remarkably small in comparison with another researcher's data. The reason is not clear, however it would have been from the difference of the content of water droplets in the air...|$|E
40|$|Wind {{power will}} {{play a major role}} in the future energy system in Sweden. Most of the major wind parks are planned to be built in sites where the cold climate and {{atmospheric}} icing can cause serious problems. This underlines the importance of addressing these issues. The major cause of these problems is in-cloud icing of the rotor blades due to super cooled liquid droplets of clouds. The droplets freeze upon impact with the rotor blade and form <b>hard</b> <b>rime</b> ice. This rime ice causes disruption in the aerodynamics that leads to production losses, extra loads on the rotor blades and when the ice is shed it poses a safety risk to people in the near environment. This master thesis focuses on how to measure the accretion of ice and the correlation between measured ice and production losses of two wind parks in northern Sweden.   The results show a good correlation between the ice accretion on a stationary sensor and the production loss from a wind turbine. In most icing events the icing of the sensor and large production losses from the wind turbine correlated clearly. Attempts to quantify the production losses at a certain ice rate measured with the stationary sensors was done, however no clear results was produced. The reason for this is that the wind turbines often stop completely during an icing event and that the time series analyzed was too short to be able to quantify the losses at certain wind speed and ice rates.   Recommendations on the type of sensor which should be used was to be produced, however the conclusion was that no single sensor has acted satisfactory and could be recommended to measure ice accretion for wind turbine applications. Due to this, at least two sensors are recommended to increase the redundancy in the measurement system. Modeling ice accretion with standard parameters measured has been done and the results show that the time of icing could be determined quite well when the sensors was ice free, however when the sensors and especially the humidity sensors was iced the time of icing was overestimated.   The main conclusion drawn is that there is a clear relationship between the icing of a stationary sensor and the rotor blade. There is still no which fulfills all demands of measuring ice accretion for wind turbine applications, further it is possible with simple models to roughly determine when icing occurs with standard measurements...|$|E
40|$|In cold seasons, {{irregular}} {{layers of}} atmospheric ice (AI) are usually accreted on the rotor blades of wind turbines. These layers can cause unexpected downtimes {{and increase the}} maintenance cost reducing the efficiency. AI presents an unpredictable mixture of crystalline and amorphous ices including such forms as dense snow frozen to the surface, soft rime, <b>hard</b> <b>rime,</b> clear ice, and glaze. The parameters of the AI-layer e. g., the thickness, mass volumetric density, porosity, elastic moduli, viscosities, and stress relaxation time, vary significantly, from a half on order to a few orders, depending on the parameter and type of AI. To solve the icing problem for wind turbines, the ice-detection and de-icing systems are needed. The ice detection systems (IDSs) should not only detect the AI-layer on the blade skin but also provide the data allowing identification of the AI-layer parameters, which are sufficient for the cost-efficient de-icing. The identification method is, thus, in {{the focus of the}} IDS development, which deals with the following main features. (1) The operational load in a blade creates irregular space-time distributions of acoustic variable (e. g., strain, stress, and displacement) which depend on the acceleration, deceleration, and speed of rotation of the rotor, the blade-pitch angle, the wind, the presence of the AI layer on the skin, and other factors. The corresponding experimental data are well documented. (2) The blade skin is a layer of a complex, curvilinear shape, which, {{in the course of the}} turbine operation, varies in space and time. This feature is also well documented. (3) The AI stress-relaxation time can be in an interval of a few orders. (4) The AI-layer parameters should be identified by means of an appropriate acoustic model from the data of the sensors, which are located on the inner surface of the blade skin and wirelessly controlled in the real-time mode by a computer and gateways. The present work develops an acoustic model and method for identification of four of the AI-layer parameters: the thickness, mass density, bulk-wave speed, and stress-relaxation time. Due to Point (1), the identification method presumes passive rather than active sensing. The method is based on measurements of the acoustic accelerations at different points on the inner surface of the skin. The challenge in Point (2) is met by the generalizing the thin-planar-disk approximation from a single solid layer to the system of the blade-skin/AI layers. The proposed identification method is computationally efficient and suitable for the use indicated in Point (4). It extends the scope of the structural health monitoring techniques...|$|E
