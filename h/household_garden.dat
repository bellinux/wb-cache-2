5000|$|New Bourbon was {{a planned}} {{tripartite}} (three-part) French village, {{divided into three}} sections, with the village {{at the core of}} the settlement containing square lots called a terrain or an emplacement which typically contained a residence, a <b>household</b> <b>garden,</b> a small orchard and barnyard animals, a barn (grange) for grain, a cabin (cabane) or shed (appenti) for corn, and perhaps a slave cabin and a horse and cow milking stable. This lot would usually be closed off with a stone or wooden fence. At the core of the village was a Catholic church and an open public space place for assembly. The village would have been surrounded by a commons referred to as a parc or parque, common fields referred to as champs or terres cultivées, and the royal domains or domaine royale beyond these areas. The commons (parc) served as a multi-use piece of land, and would be used to provide herbage for cattle, wood for fuel and fencing, and berries and fruit. The common fields were divided into long, narrow strips champs en long (long lots) which were a few arpents wide and roughly 40 arpents long, and were used to raise wheat, corn and oats. After the harvest, these champs would be used to graze cattle and horses, with their manure acting as a means to fertilize the fields. The royal domains functioned as a commons for general use as the inhabitants deemed fit.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Background: Rural {{poverty and}} {{lack of access to}} {{education}} has led to urban migration and fed the constant growth of urban slums on the outskirts of Lima, Peru. These informal settlements suffer from public access to water and sanitation, informal land rights, food and water insecurity, all of which contribute to poorer health outcomes. We explored the feasibility of implementing household gardens using participatory design methods and examined the impact of increased green space on wellbeing. Methods: Between September 2013 and September 2014, we conducted a repeated measures longitudinal study with 29 community members in an informal settlement of 82 households in Lima, Peru. We assessed changes in physical and mental health after participatory design and construction of household gardens. Anthropometric data and a composite of five validated mental health surveys were collected at baseline, 6 -months, and 12 -months after garden construction. Results: Twelve months after garden construction, we found significant increases from baseline in all domains of quality of life—physical (p< 0. 01), psychological (p= 0. 05), social (p= 0. 02), and environmental (p= 0. 02) —in overall social capital (p< 0. 01), and perceived stress (p< 0. 01). Life threatening experiences decreased compared to baseline significantly (p= 0. 02). There were no significant changes in parent or partner empathy (p= 0. 21), BMI (p= 0. 95), waist circumference (p= 0. 18), or blood pressure (p= 0. 66) at 6 or 12 months.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate environmental contamination derived from metalliferous mining activities. In the study area, the Dalsung Cu–W mine, soils, various crop plants, stream waters, sediments and particulates were sampled in and around the mine and analyzed for As, Sb and Bi by ICP-AES with a hydride generator. In addition, soil pH, cation exchange capacity, loss-on-ignition and soil texture were also measured. Concentrations of As, Sb and Bi in surface soils sampled in the mine dump sites averaged 2500, 54 and 436 mg g, respectively. Relatively lower concentrations, however, were found in soils from alluvial and high land sites andy 1 <b>household</b> <b>garden</b> sites. Arsenic, Sb and Bi contents in plant samples varied depending upon their species and parts, with higher concentrations in spring onions, soybean leaves and perilla leaves and lower levels in red peppers, corn grains and jujube grains. These results confirm that elemental concentrations in plant leaves are much higher than those in plant grain. Elevated levels of As, Sb and Bi were also found in stream sediments sampled in the vicinity of the mine and decreased with distance from the mine. Concentrations in stream water samples ranged from 0. 8 to 19. 1 mg As l and from 0. 3 to 8. 4 mg Bi l; all the samples contained less than 1. 0 mg Sb l. Because of veryy 1 y 1 y 1 low particulate loading at the time of sampling, the metal contents in particulates were very low (- 8. 2 mg As l,-y 1 0. 22 mg Sb l and 2. 8 mg Bi l.

40|$|Challenges at {{hazardous}} waste and contaminated sites are persistent, complex, and multifactorial, and unfortunately the progress in implementing solutions is slow. This delay {{can be attributed}} to the lack of collaboration, information transfer to the end-user, and partnership building among academia, government and the affected community. As a solution, Environmental Research Translation (ERT), a framework that is rooted in existing participatory models, and encompasses many of the key principles from informal science education and community-based participatory research is proposed. The ERT framework lead to a community-academic partnership called: Gardenroots: The Dewey-Humboldt, Arizona Garden Project. Vegetable gardening in contaminated soils presents a health hazard. A controlled greenhouse study was conducted in parallel with a co-created citizen science program to characterize the uptake of arsenic by homegrown vegetables near the Iron King Mine and Humboldt Smelter Superfund Site in Arizona. Community members, after training, collected soil, water and vegetable samples from their <b>household</b> <b>garden.</b> The greenhouse and home garden arsenic soil concentrations ranged from 2. 35 to 533 mg kg⁻¹. In the greenhouse experiment four vegetables were grown in three different soil treatments and a total of 63 home garden produce samples were obtained from 19 properties neighboring the site. All vegetables accumulated arsenic, ranging from 0. 01 - 23. 0 mg kg⁻¹ dry weight. Bioconcentration factors were determined and arsenic uptake decreased in the order: Asteraceae > Brassicaceae >> Amaranthaceae > Cucurbitaceae > Liliaceae > Solanaceae > Fabaceae. Concentrations of arsenic measured in potable water, soils and vegetable samples were used in conjunction with reported US intake rates to calculate daily dose, excess cancer risk and Hazard Quotient for arsenic. Relative arsenic intake dose decreased in order: potable water > garden soils > well washed homegrown vegetables, and on average, each accounted for 79, 14 and 7 %, of a residential gardener's daily arsenic intake dose. The IELCR ranges for vegetables, garden soils and potable water were 10 ⁻⁸ to 10 ⁻⁴, 10 ⁻⁶ to 10 ⁻⁴; and 10 ⁻⁵ to 10 ⁻², respectively. The ERT framework improved environmental health research, information transfer, and risk communication efforts.
