5000|$|The report, {{as widely}} expected, {{justified}} the shooting. But it criticised the Police for not applying measures, {{such as the}} use to tear gas, to keep the crowd away from the <b>factory</b> <b>compound.</b> The members of the commission also felt that the shooting period went beyond what was reasonable when they stated: [...] "We are, therefore, of the opinion that the evidence has established that after the first few shots, there was firing which went beyond the requirements of the situation, with the result that Pooran notably and some others received shots when in actual flight".|$|E

50|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 16 June a crowd of about 400 workers {{gathered}} outside the factory at Enmore for a protest and picketing exercise. The management of Enmore Estate was expecting this protest action, and the evening before had requested assistance from the Police.

50|$|At that time, Chinese {{authorities}} limited {{trade with}} the outside world to the port of Canton. All foreign traders were further restricted to living and working on <b>factory</b> <b>compounds</b> established {{on the banks of the}} Pearl River. American trade with China increased steadily throughout the early decades of the nineteenth century, although there were long periods during which the office of the U.S. Consul at Canton was unoccupied, and Americans serving at the consulate typically did not speak Chinese. In the wake of the Opium War between China and Great Britain, however, the Chinese government was compelled to expand trading opportunities beyond Canton. After the conclusion of the hostilities, the first U.S. formal mission to China, led by former Congressman Caleb Cushing, brokered the 1844 Treaty of Wanghia, an agreement which secured trading privileges for American merchants and opened new Chinese ports to American vessels. In addition to protecting the interests of United States merchants, American consuls enjoyed greater authority granted by Congress; in 1848 the Consulate was allowed to arraign U.S. citizens charged with offenses against the laws of China. The Canton consulate was burned down in 1856, but U.S. diplomats continued to support an expanding American presence in the region throughout the nineteenth century.|$|R

50|$|By 10.00 a.m. {{the crowd}} had grown to between 500 and 600 persons and was led {{by one of the}} workers {{carrying}} a red flag. They attempted to enter the <b>factory</b> <b>compound</b> through the gates and through two trench gaps at the rear by which punts entered the factory. But they were prevented from doing so because the locked gates and the punt gaps were protected by policemen. A section of the crowd then hurled bricks and sticks at the policemen, and several persons managed to enter the compound on the rear of the factory. The policemen tried to push back the crowd, but after this effort failed, they opened fire and five workers were killed and fourteen others were injured.|$|E

With the help of Lt Woodson, who survived the previous attack, they secure the compound {{and turn it into a}} Ranger outpost. Their goals are now fourfold: acquire enough zeolite and cat litter to upgrade their radiation suits, allowing them passage across all of LA; fit out more radio towers with repeaters to boost the signal back to Arizona and tell Vargas that they have survived; help out the locals with their problems to promote the Ranger name; and track down the source of the suspicious signal.|$|E
50|$|At noon on 17 July, Cheka officer Pyotr Startsev {{and a few}} Bolshevik workers came to the school. They {{took from}} the prisoners {{whatever}} money they had left and announced {{that they would be}} transferred that night to the Upper Siniachikhensky <b>factory</b> <b>compound.</b> The Red Army guards were told to leave and Cheka men replaced them. That night the prisoners were awakened and driven in carts on a road leading to the village of Siniachikha, some 18 km from Alapayevsk where there was an abandoned iron mine with a pit 20 m deep. Here they halted. The Cheka beat all the prisoners before throwing their victims into this pit, Elisabeth being the first. Hand grenades were then hurled down the shaft, but only one victim, Fyodor Remez, {{died as a result of}} the grenades.|$|E
30|$|Since the {{founding}} of the People's Repbulic of China, the state has played a pivotal role in structuring inequality (Bian 1994). In the Mao period (1949 – 1978), urbanites and rural farmers were spatially segregated through the hukou or household registration system, created in 1957 to bar individuals from moving from their place of birth. The policy relegated the peasantry to agricultural labor in collectives, while the urban-born worked in state-owned factories and other institutions, where they received substantial benefits not available to the peasantry (Walder 1988). With the advent of market reforms in the 1980 s, rural people were allowed to travel for work in foreign-invested factories on the Southeast Coast, drawing. The policy shift promped a massive supply of rural labor to migrate these workplaces (Pun 2005). The new hukou rules allowed peasants only temporary sojourn in cities and excluded them from urban citizenship. On a practical level, this meant they were ineligible for health insurance and housing subsidies, and often exempted from labor laws, while their children were barred from urban schools (Solinger 1999). 2 As the country developed its mammoth export manufacturing sector, urban employers and local governments escaped these obligations to their migrant workers. This both minimized the costs of proletarianization and reproduced a sharp structural divide between urban and migrant workers. Employers sequestered migrants in <b>factory</b> <b>compounds,</b> assigning them to on-site dormitories. Thus, contact with urbanites was quite limited.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the Polish chemical industry is connected with the professor of University of Technology in Lwów - Ignacy Mościcki, who became director of the nitric <b>compound</b> <b>factory</b> in Royal Steel Plant (later Chorzów) acquired from the German side upon the Silesian uprisings. The main promotor of chemical industry development, including nitric compounds, in Poland was the Chemical Research Institute in Warsaw established by I. Mościcki. The plans of chemical industry development were conceived in this institute, including {{the construction of the}} second large nitric <b>compounds</b> <b>factory.</b> The final decision on building the new factory in Tarnów was taken on 12 March 1927. Farm goods were purchased from the family of Sanguszkowie, measuring 670 hectares, for the sum of 207 thousand American dollars. The first works on the construction site were commenced on 5 May 1927.|$|R
5000|$|A former U.S. State Department {{official}} in October 2001 described Bosnia and Herzegovina {{as a safe}} haven for terrorists, and asserted that militant elements of the former Sarajevo government were protecting extremists, some with ties to Osama bin Laden.

50|$|The estate offices, coach {{house and}} stables block were {{probably}} {{built in the}} 18th century by John Paterson, however {{it is suggested that}} the architect was Robert Adam. Old photographs show that a pair of matching entrances to the central 'archway' existed, but were replaced by windows and walling at an unknown date. The building was first converted and extended to form a factory, opened by the 17th Earl in 1958 for Newforge Canning Factories (Ireland), otherwise known as Wilson's canning factory. This factory has been out of use for some years and is currently undergoing redevelopment into residential properties consisting of 12 apartments within the listed stable building and 24 detached houses with the former <b>factory</b> <b>compound.</b> The 2 car parks adjacent to the factory are to be removed and replaced with one single car park situated towards the visitor center.|$|E

50|$|In {{part due}} to the German-Polish trade war in the 1920s, the {{industry}} of Chorzów, a border city at that time, stagnated until 1933.

In the initial period of its operation, PFZA produced ca. 60 tons of ammonia per day. Nitrogen necessary for synthesis was obtained {{as a result of}} air condensation with Linde method and hydrogen out of water gas.
