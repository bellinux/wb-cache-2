50|$|The United States has an {{assortment}} of federal, state, local, and special-purpose governmental jurisdictions. Each <b>imposes</b> taxes to fully or partly fund its operations. These taxes may be <b>imposed</b> on the same income, property or activity, often without offset of one tax against another.

Taxes on property are typically <b>imposed</b> only at the local level, though there may be multiple local jurisdictions that tax the same property. Other excise taxes are <b>imposed</b> by the federal and some state governments. Sales taxes are <b>imposed</b> by most states and many local governments.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. A channel with 40 to 1 aspect ratio and rectangular cross-section {{is used to}} {{study the effects of}} <b>imposed</b> oscillations on transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Oscillations are <b>imposed</b> using a single rotating vane located in the flow downstream of the test section. Flows with Reynolds numbers ranging from 1100 to 3580 and Strouhal numbers from 0. 0211 to 0. 2418 are studied. For all cases, time-averaged velocity profiles are unaffected by <b>imposed</b> oscillations. <b>Imposed</b> oscillations have a destabilizing effect on the flow {{near the edge of the}} Stokes layer. Turbulence intensity magnitudes with <b>imposed</b> oscillations show that transition to turbulence begins at lower Reynolds numbers and extends over a wider range of Reynolds numbers than when no <b>imposed</b> oscillations are present. In addition, higher levels of intermittency are present with <b>imposed</b> oscillations for Reynolds numbers 1900 to 2200 at yd= 0. 90. At Reynolds numbers from 1450 to 1800, frequency spectra evidence high intensity intermittent turbulent fluctuations, followed and preceded by quiescent flow, both with and without <b>imposed</b> oscillations. A center mode of secondary instability is evidenced by high values of normalized longitudinal turbulence intensity measured in the channel center when no oscillations are <b>imposed</b> on the flow. <b>Imposed</b> oscillations are found to suppress this center mode of secondary instability, as evidenced by reductions in longitudinal turbulence intensity values near the channel center.
