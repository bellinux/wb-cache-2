40|$|Abstract – With video {{conferencing}} becoming extremely popular in wired and wireless network, efficient {{utilization of the}} network bandwidth is important to achieve Quality of Service (QOS). Internet Protocol (IP) multicast is a routing technique that allows <b>IP</b> <b>traffic</b> to be <b>sent</b> from one source or multiple sources and delivered to multiple destinations. Instead of sending individual packets to each destination, a single packet is sent to a multicast group, which is identified by a single IP destination group address. In this paper it is proposed to compare the performance of {{video conferencing}} using unicast and multicast communication using Protocol Independent Multicasting – Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) modes...|$|R
40|$|Internet edge {{mobility}} {{has been}} {{possible for a}} number of years: mobile IP[8], allows a host to change its point of attachment to the Internet and NEMO [6] allows the same functionality for a group of hosts along with a mobile router. The virtue of NEMO and mobile IP is transparency: a host remains identifiable through the same <b>IP</b> address, and <b>traffic</b> <b>sent</b> to that <b>IP</b> address will be tunneled to arrive at the intended node. NEMO allows “nested networks”: a mobile network which attaches to another mobile network to arbitrary depth. However for each level of nesting, traffic is encapsulated and tunneled to reach the destination. This leads to increased overhead (encapsulation) and to sub-optimal paths (tunneling without consideration for the actual network topology). In this paper, we investigate route-optimization in nested NEMO networks. We employ an ad-hoc routing protocol between mobile routers to ensure shortest routes when both source and destination for traffic is within the nested NEMO network. The mechanism also simplifies the requirements for route optimization when the source node is located outside of the nested NEMO network...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTraditional {{real-time}} <b>IP</b> <b>traffic</b> analysis applied on todays' {{high-speed network}} links {{suffers from the}} lack of scalability. Although sampling proves to be a promising approach, there are application scenarios foreseen, in which decisions cannot be based on sampled data, e. g., for usage- based charging or intrusion detection systems. Moreover, traditional traffic analysis mechanisms do not map the traffic observed in the network to a particular user, but rather to a particular end-node, which may have been shared by several users.

40|$|Nowadays, accounting, {{charging}} and billing users' network resource consumption {{are commonly}} used {{for the purpose of}} facilitating reasonable network usage, controlling congestion, allocating cost, gaining revenue, etc. In traditional <b>IP</b> <b>traffic</b> accounting systems, <b>IP</b> addresses are used to identify the corresponding consumers of the network resources. However, there are some situations in which IP addresses cannot be used to identify users uniquely, for example, in multi-user systems. In these cases, network resource consumption can only be ascribed to the owners of these hosts instead of corresponding real users who have consumed the network resources. Therefore, accurate accountability in these systems is practically impossible. This is a flaw of the traditional IP address based <b>IP</b> <b>traffic</b> accounting technique. This dissertation proposes a user based <b>IP</b> <b>traffic</b> accounting model which can facilitate collecting network resource usage information on the basis of users. With user based <b>IP</b> <b>traffic</b> accounting, <b>IP</b> <b>traffic</b> can be distinguished not only by IP addresses but also by users. In this dissertation, three different schemes, which can achieve the user based <b>IP</b> <b>traffic</b> accounting mechanism, are discussed in detail. The inband scheme utilizes the IP header to convey the user information of the corresponding IP packet. The Accounting Agent residing in the measured host intercepts IP packets passing through it. Then it identifies the users of these IP packets and inserts user information into the IP packets. With this mechanism, a meter located in a key position of the network can intercept the IP packets tagged with user information, extract not only statistic information, but also IP addresses and user information from the IP packets to generate accounting records with user information. The out-of-band scheme is a contrast scheme to the in-band scheme. It also uses an Accounting Agent to intercept IP packets and identify the users of <b>IP</b> <b>traffic.</b> However, the user information is transferred through a separated channel, which is different from the corresponding IP packets' transmission. The Multi-IP scheme provides a different solution for identifying users of <b>IP</b> <b>traffic.</b> It assigns each user in a measured host a unique IP address. Through that, an IP address can be used to identify a user uniquely without ambiguity. This way, traditional IP address based accounting techniques can be applied to achieve the goal of user based <b>IP</b> <b>traffic</b> accounting. In this dissertation, a user based <b>IP</b> <b>traffic</b> accounting prototype system developed according to the out-of-band scheme is also introduced. The application of user based <b>IP</b> <b>traffic</b> accounting model in the distributed computing environment is also discussed. Ein Modell für Nutzerbasiertes IP-Verkehr Accountin...|$|R
