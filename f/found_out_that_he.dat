Đức mistakenly thought Kỳ and his subordinates would join the coup, but later realized that he was mistaken. After he <b>found</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been tricked into thinking that the plotters had great strength, he defected. Several U.S. advisers were chased away by rebel officers who did not want interference in the coup. They thought the Americans would not approve of their actions, as both U.S. Ambassador Maxwell Taylor and President Lyndon Johnson had made optimistic comments about South Vietnam recently.|$|E

25|$|Jackson held true to his threat not to sign, and the Buccaneers {{forfeited}} {{his rights}} before the 1987 draft.
