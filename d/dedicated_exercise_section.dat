The work carried out by Mrs. Joan Hine and Professor G. B. Wetherill at Bath University, together with some other help from time to time by colleagues at Bath University and elsewhere. Testing was done at various colleges and universities, and some helpful comments were received, but we particularly mention King Edwards School, Bath, who provided some sixth formers as 'guinea pigs' for the first testing, the Bishop Lonsdale College of Education, and Bradford University. 2 OUf objectives in the text are to take students to the use of standard t, F and X tests, with some intro­ duction to regression, assuming no knowledge of statistics to start, and to do this {{in such a way that}} students attain some degree of understanding of the underlying reasoning.

Learning from this <b>exercise,</b> <b>Section</b> 8 presents the way forward: how should resource accounting models be made consumer–centric. Section 9 illustrates how consumer–centric models can form the basis for creating tools for consumers that automate the task of computing billing charges.

Literature searches for publications (January 1980 –February 2009) in Medline (OVID), PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), EBSCOhost EJS, ProQuest Central, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink (Kluwer), and Wiley Interscience (Blackwell) were performed. Reference lists from relevant articles were hand-searched for further publications.

One hundred and seventy one publications were found with a primary focus on exercise in hemodialysis. Of these, 28 primary research and 14 review articles addressed {{one or more}} aspects of sustainability of hemodialysis exercise programs. Factors contributing to sustainable <b>exercise</b> programs included: <b>dedicated</b> <b>exercise</b> professionals; encouragement to exercise intradialytically; dialysis and medical staff commitment; adequate physical requirements of equipment and space; interesting and stimulating; cost implications need to be addressed; exercise is not for everyone; requires individual prescription; {{and there is no}} age barrier to exercise on hemodialysis. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Thermal images, or {{infrared}} images, are {{representations of}} the world based on heat, instead of visible light. Research {{has shown that the}} resulting thermal image results in perceptual differences leading to difficulties in interpretation (e. g., the determination of slope angle, concavity/convexity), or increased identification latencies. A joint research project between the United States (NASA and U. S. Army) and Israel (Ministry of Defense and Israel Air Force) has resulted {{in the development of a}} prototype part-task trainer for the acquisition of perceptual skills associated with thermal imaging usage. This prototype system is videodisk-based under computer control, using recordings of thermal images. A lesson section introduces declarative knowledge, in which the basic physics and heuristics of thermal imagery are taught.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{is unique}} as it {{provides}} a uniform treatment of the Fourier theories of functions (Fourier transforms and series, z-transforms), finite measures (characteristic functions, convergence in distribution), and stochastic processes (including arma series and point processes). It emphasises the links between these three themes. The chapter on the Fourier theory of point processes and signals structured by point processes is a novel addition to the literature on Fourier analysis of stochastic processes. It also connects the theory with recent lines of research such as biological spike signals and ultrawide-band communications. Although the treatment is mathematically rigorous, the convivial style makes the book accessible to a large audience. In particular, {{it will be interesting}} to anyone working in electrical engineering and communications, biology (point process signals) and econometrics (arma models). Each chapter has an <b>exercise</b> <b>section,</b> which makes Fourier Analysis and Stochastic Processes suitable for a graduate course in applied mathematics, as well as for self-study...|$|R
40|$|People's {{tendency}} to be more generous toward identifiable victims than toward unidentifiable or statistical victims {{is known as the}} Identifiable Victim Effect. Recent research has called the generality of this effect into question, showing that in cross-national contexts, identifiability mostly affects willingness to help victims of one's own "in-group. " Furthermore, in inter-group conflict situations, identifiability increased generosity toward a member of the adversary group, but decreased generosity toward a member of one's own group. In the present research we examine the role of group-cohesiveness as an underlying factor accounting for these divergent findings. In particular, we examined novel groups generated in the lab, using the minimal group paradigm, as well as natural groups of students in regular <b>exercise</b> <b>sections.</b> Allocation decisions in dictator games revealed that a group's cohesiveness affects generosity toward in-group and out-group recipients differently, depending on their identifiability. In particular, in cohesive groups the identification of an in-group recipient decreased, rather than increased generosity...|$|R
