40|$|Purpose: {{investigation}} of structural transformations of low-carbon and low-alloyed steels {{and development of}} a quantitative model of formation of the structure and properties of hot-rolled strips. It is established that the kinetics of spheroidization of pearlite in carbon and low-alloyed steels fits the equation of Avrami. A mechanism of formation of structurally <b>free</b> <b>cementite</b> is proposed. The obtained quantitative laws of structural transformations in the roll {{make it possible to}} predict the variation of the structure and properties of the rolled stock depending on its cooling conditions on the run-out table. The model of prediction of the structure and properties was used as part of the automatic control system of the hot-rolling mill 2500 of new Lipetsk Metallurgical PlantAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Scientific and {{practical}} {{interest is the}} application of alloying alloy-modifiers for secondary treatment of high-strength cast iron to stabilize the process of spheroidization graphite and achieving higher physical-mechanical properties of castings. The peculiarity of the high-strength cast irons manufacturing technology is their tendency to supercooling during solidification in the mold. This leads {{to the formation of}} shrinkage defects and structurally <b>free</b> <b>cementite,</b> especially in thin-walled sections of the finished castings. To minimize these effects in foundry practice during production of ductile iron the secondary inoculation is widely used. In this regard, the question of the choice of the additives with effective impact not only on the graphitization process but also on the formation of the metallic base of ductile iron is relevant. The aim of the present work is to study the peculiarities of structure formation in cast iron with nodular graphite when alloying alloy-modifier based on tin with additions of nanoparticles of titanium carbide, yttrium oxide and graphite nano-pipes is used for secondary treatment. Melting of iron in laboratory conditions was performed in crucible induction furnace IST- 006 with an acid lining held. Spheroidizing treatment of melt was realized with magnesium containing alloying alloy FeSiMg 7 by means of ladle method. Secondary treatment of high strength cast iron was carried out by addition of alloying alloy-modifier in an amount of 0. 1 % {{to the bottom of the}} pouring ladle. Cast samples for chemical composition analysis, study of microstructure, technological and mechanical properties of the resultant alloy were made. Studies have shown that the secondary treatment of high strength cast iron with developed modifier-alloying alloy results in formation of the perlite metallic base due to the tin impact and nodular graphite with regular shape under the influence of titanium carbide, yttrium oxide and graphite nano-pipes. The tendency of high strength cast iron to «white cast iron» formation has been minimized, and the mechanical properties of the alloy produced correspond to HSCI 80. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of bainite morphology {{on the impact}} toughness behaviour of a continuously cooled <b>cementite</b> <b>free</b> low carbon C-Mn-B type of steel has been examined. Different bainite morphologies were obtained by cooling from the austenite regime to ambient temperature with different cooling rates. The resulting microstructures have been quantitatively analysed using light optical microscopy (LOM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) techniques. The relationship between the steel morphology and impact toughness has been discussed. It could be shown that bainitic microstructures formed mainly by lath-like upper bainite, consisting of thin and long parallel ferrite laths, exhibit higher impact toughness values than those with a granular bainite morphology, consisting of an equiaxed ferrite structure and discrete islands of M/A phases. Granular bainite shows evidence of low resistance to crack propagation during cleavage fracture because of its larger crystallographic packet size. Moreover, the stress concentration associated with coarse M/A grains is considered as a possible factor contributing to the premature crack nucleation. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{the trend}} {{around the world}} is to produce lighter wires with higher {{strength}} for long span bridge applications and the automobile tire industry. Increasing the carbon content in the steel is the most common way to achieve higher strength in these applications. The chosen steel in this study was SAE 1092. The advantage of this steel is its higher strength but the disadvantage is the formation of a brittle phase. In this type of hypereutectoid steel, the proeutectoid cementite precipitates along the austenite grain boundaries prior to the formation of the pearlite. As the amount of carbon increases above the eutectoid point, more of this brittle phase precipitates. At the beginning of this work, two proeutectoid cementite networks were identified; one in the center and the other close {{to the surface of the}} wire rod. Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) was used to crytallographically define that proeutectoid cementite forms at certain grain boundaries of a given orientation. Dilatometric tests were carried out to verify the minimum cooling rate necessary to avoid the formation of the proeutectoid cementite. It was also used to verify the influence of the environment on the transformation of austenite and the precipitation of the proeutectoid cementite. Industrial experiments were also carried out in order to determine what conditions should be used to produce wire rods with large diameters and <b>free</b> of proeutectoid <b>cementite</b> network...|$|R
