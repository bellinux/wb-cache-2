40|$|Reasons of {{development}} of life-threatening arrhythmias {{that lead to}} sudden and total death in cases of cardiovascular diseases are still unclear, though cardiac research of this problem is conducted throughout the world. Damage of connective tissues <b>insulation</b> <b>cover</b> of the heart’s conductive pathways with oxidation of ectopic nodes can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. This damage has never been considered before {{as a cause of}} electrical instability of the heart. Accordingly, treatment of such patients should change, and consequently should reduce the total number of sudden deaths due to cardiovascular diseases. The speed of electricity conduction from the heart to the nervous system and its distribution throughout the body remains underestimated. Slowdown of electric magnetic induction (acceleration) between the heart and the central nervous system as well as slowdown of its distribution results in insufficient speed of electric flow and reduction of bioelectric processes of the body. This leads to activation of the sympathetic nervous system with the subsequent cascade of pressor mechanisms and development of essential hypertension...|$|E

40|$|Virgin olive oil(VOO) is {{a product}} {{characterized}} by high economic and nutritional values, because of its superior sensory characteristics and minor compounds (phenols and tocopherols) contents. Since the original quality of VOO may change during its storage, this study aimed to investigate the influence of different storage and shipment conditions {{on the quality of}} VOO, by studying different solutions such as filtration, dark storage and shipment inside insulated containers to protect it. Different analytical techniques were used to follow-up the quality changes during virgin olive oil storage and simulated shipments, in terms of basic quality parameters, sensory analysis and evaluation of minor components (phenolic compounds, diglycerides, volatile compounds). Four main research streams were presented in this PhD thesis: The results obtained from the first experimental section revealed that the application of filtration and/or clarification can decrease the unavoidable quality loss of the oil samples during storage, in comparison with unfiltered oil samples. The second section indicated that the virgin olive oil freshness, evaluated by diglycerides content, was mainly affected by the storage time and temperature. The third section revealed that fluctuation in temperature during storage may adversely affect the virgin olive oil quality, in terms of hydrolytic rancidity and oxidation quality. The fourth section showed that virgin olive oil shipped inside insulated containers showed lower hydrolytic and oxidation degradation than those without <b>insulation</b> <b>cover.</b> Overall, this PhD thesis highlighted that application of adequate treatment, such as filtration or clarification, in addition to a good protection against other external variables, such as temperature and light, will improve the stability of virgin olive oil during storage...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The {{triangular}} {{design of a}} solar water heater not only enhances the overall gain to the system but also improves the natural convection between the absorbing plate and the water, leading to better performance of the system. A night <b>insulation</b> <b>cover</b> is used at the top surface of the heater to reduce the losses from the system during the off-sunshine hours. Another {{way to reduce the}} losses from the system is by using an insulating baffle plate in the tank. This plate divides the tank water into two portions, the water above this plate is known as the upper column and below is known as the lower column. The water of the two columns is in contact with each other {{with the help of the}} incoming and outgoing vents provided in the baffle plate. This plate also suppresses losses from the lower column during the off-sunshine hours. In this paper, we have studied the effect of a baffle plate on the performance ofa triangular built-in-storage solar water heater. To obtain the thermal behavior of the system, the energy balance quations are written at the different nodes, and the well-known finite difference forward time step marching technique is used for their solution. The proposed system is studied by varying the vent area, the water mass in the two columns and under a constant flow rate for different durations. The effects of the thermal conductivity and thickness of the baffle plate on the water temperature are also investigated. It is found that the presence of the baffle plate greatly improves the system performance during off-sunshine hours...|$|E

40|$|Broilers {{experience}} high {{physiological stress}} during pre-slaughter transport, especially under extremes of thermal environment. Characterization of thermal environment on the trailer {{is crucial to}} identify stress-prone regions during transportation. At the same time, Broilers experience high physiological stress during pre-slaughter transport, especially under extremes of thermal environment. Characterization of thermal environment on the trailer is crucial to identify stress-prone regions during transportation. At the same time, quantification of heat loss of the broilers loaded on trailers is important in understanding {{the well-being of the}} broilers. We have developed four electronic chickens (E-chickens) to simulate the sensible heat loss of live broiler during transit and holding period in commercial live-haul trips. It is an average broiler-sized enclosure with a thermostatically controlled circuit to keep the internal temperature at 41 °C. Power consumption as a result of four different combinations of covering the enclosure as well as their sensitivity with exposed wind were compared. Double layer of fleece fabric was selected as the <b>insulation</b> <b>cover</b> for the E-chickens to match the sensible heat production reported in literature. Heat loss exhibited a positive correlation with the wind and a negative correlation with the temperature gradient between internal and external environment. However, the wet cover of E-chickens did not increase heat loss compared to dry cover, indicating its inability to release moisture unlike evaporation from natural feathers and respiratory water loss. Thirty-two commercial live-haul trips were monitored to determine humidity ratio increase-above-ambient air humidity, E-chickens were installed in eight of the trips. Moderate levels of measured power consumption of the E-chickens suggested that ambient temperatures in the range of 11 °C- 25. 1 °C (during transit) and 5. 3 °C- 21. 7 °C (during holding) were in the zone of thermal comfort (allowing the live chickens to regulate heat by their metabolism to stay comfortable). For the holding period, the winter trips were mostly in the zone of thermal comfort, but during summers, hyperthermic conditions were widespread during transit. Fan-assisted evaporative cooling during on-farm loading may have introduced additional cooling due to wetting of live chicken surface, not quantified by the limitation of E-chickens. The mild weather observed during spring and fall season was the most comfortable for broilers...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} develops {{with the}} objective to investigate the technical aspects related to green roofs and evaluate their possible installation on existing buildings. In fact, using these technological solutions for the roof, can be easily implements in the new buildings but collides with multiple difficulties in the existing buildings. In this regard, it is consider interesting to investigate the technological aspects related to these solutions. In order to identify the main constraints that prevent the implementations of green roofs on existing buildings and to define {{the conditions under which}} this type of installation can find the effective implementation also on existing buildings, without relevant construction works. The objective of this work is the assessment of the feasibility of the installation of green roofs on existing buildings. In particular, we set ourselves the goal {{is to be able to}} identify technological constraints, architectural and structural, that make impossible the installation of green roofs in existing buildings. Based on these assessments, will be to demonstrate that below definite conditions, the installation of green roofs is also possible on the existing buildings. The green roofs are gradually more popular, especially on new buildings, due to the greater sensitivity of the actors in the construction market with respect to issues related to environmental protection and the design of solutions to reduce the energy consumption of buildings. In this context, in recent times, research has provided confirmations about the benefits related to the implementation of green covering on the buildings roofs. In particular, we highlighted the positive impact of the reduction of urban heat island effect, reducing energy consumption for air conditioning in summer and winter and reducing the outflow of rainwater. However, it is not known yet what is the potential of the city to adopt in their already built environment green roofs. In this sense, the work of the proposed research has the target to give a very first contribution to provide the answer to this question. We conduct the analysis by comparing performances of a designed green roof from different technological solutions of the current situation. We evaluated the implementation of intensive and extensive green roofs on existing building with a flat roof. We chose to proceed developing the extensive green roofs, as less onerous in terms of loads and so more suitable for installation on an existing building. We also considered a possible traditional and insulate solution (thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>cover,</b> without the realization of green roof) to replace the existing roof, with which was made comparisons for each category evaluated. For each solution, both at green roof and traditional insulated, we are determined all the values relating to the energy performances of the building and the values of the static load introduced by installations. Last one, evaluated in conditions of saturation of the soil that is the situation more onerous as regards the green covering. Obtained results show that the implementation of a green roof on an existing building, compared to a general improvement of the energy performance, implying a heavier load on the roof. By a purely legal point of view, analysis indicate that the load introduced would not require a revision of the building structure. This is because there is not a change in the roof destination use and the weight of the introduced solution by extensive green roof does not exceed 10...|$|E

Passive Cooling Strategies Overview Buildings should be designed in relation to specific climatic conditions, the changed function or the time of use or occupancy levels of internal and external spaces, and in relation to how these decisions will impact parts that remain unaltered. Landscaping can be used to improve both external and internal comfort and energy efficiency. Improvements can also be target specific, such as fitting shading devices over existing openings. PROTECTED ENTRIES AND OUTDOOR LIVING o Provide indoor/outdoor transitions with extended roof overhangs and the use of verandas, arcades, and porches to serve as shaded entries and buffers between indoor and outdoor spaces. o Partially enclose external spaces (e. g. open trellises, walls and/or small courtyards) so that they can be managed by alteration of microclimate with shade, evaporative cooling and airflow. o Water features such as fountains (evaporative cooling) and vegetation in semienclosed spaces can be used to create pleasant and usable outdoor microclimates. o Incorporate landscape strategies that can alter the surrounding condition of a building: planting to shade a building, a canopy selection that does not restrict air movement, inclusion of water for evaporative cooling and ground cover selection to reduce heat reflection and glare, for example grass instead of paving. o The function and use of internal spaces should be related to orientation.
