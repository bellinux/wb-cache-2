We explored the plasticity of different white <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> depots in acquiring a brown phenotype by cold exposure. By comparing cold-induced genes in white fat to those enriched in brown compared to white fat, at thermoneutrality, we defined a "BRITE" transcription signature. We identified the genes, pathways and promoter regulatory motifs associated with "browning" as these represent novel targets for understanding this process. For example, Neuregulin 4 was more highly expressed in brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> upregulated in white fat upon cold exposure and cell studies showed it is a neurite outgrowth-promoting adipokine, {{indicative of a}} role in increasing <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> innervation in response to cold.

The differences between brown and white <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> are brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> have higher activity in glyceroneogenesis than white <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> and glyceroneogenesis in brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> is related to thermogenesis.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{it was shown}} that (brown) <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> {{associated}} metabolic dysfunction increases the risk on development of cardiovascular disease in high risk patients. Quantity of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> is an important risk factor for <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> dysfunction but functionality of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> not solely relies on its quantity. The capacity of adipocytes to expand and safely store nutrients may greatly influence functionality of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> and cardiovascular risk. Also in normal weight patients whose high risk may go unnoticed. With increasing severity of cardiovascular burden the metabolic consequences of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> dysfunction become {{even more important than}} strict measures of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> quantity to estimate cardiovascular risk. These findings underline the urge for timely detection of (dys) functional <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> Functionality of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> is accompanied by local structural changes in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> composition which may be quantified using various imaging techniques. We show that Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are able to assess differences in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> composition that associate with local and systemic consequences of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> (dys) function. For example, differences in cardiovascular risk factor profile are associated with differences in epicardial <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> composition as measured by CT density in Hounsfield Units. Subsequently, differences in CT density of epicardial <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> are associated with higher scores of coronary artery calcification in men. These findings indicate the potential role for epicardial <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> density as a measure of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> function in the development of cardiovascular disease. In addition to subcutaneous white <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> (WAT) another type of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> named brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> (BAT), may exist in humans. BAT is predominantly located within the supraclavicular <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> depot interspersed within WAT cells. BAT is hypothesized to dissipate energy via non-shivering thermogenesis to maintain body temperature during periods of cold and thereby contribute to cardiometabolic health. Due to differences in intracellular water content the Fat signal Fraction of BAT differs from WAT. In thesis we show that MRI reproducibly measures Fat signal Fractions in supraclavicular and subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> Furthermore, we show that supraclavicular <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> still has BAT characteristics in adult patients with clinical manifest cardiovascular disease and that BAT presence is associated with general measures of obesity and metabolic dysfunction.

To understand a physiological and pathological role of natural killer T (NKT) cells on inflammation in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> we characterized a subset of NKT cells in abdominal and subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice fed normal or high-fat diets.

Furthermore, some NKT cells in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> expressed higher levels of CD 69 and intracellular interferon-γ, whereas the Vβ repertoires of NKT cells in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> were similar to other cells. In obese mice fed a high-fat diet, <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> inflammation had little effect on the Vβ repertoire of NKT cells in epididymal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues.</b> We speculate that the NKT cells in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> may form an equivalent subset in other tissues and that these subsets are likely to participate in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> inflammation.

40|$|Obesity {{results from}} {{expansion}} of white <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> The inability of white <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> to adequately store lipids leads to ectopic deposition of lipids in non-adipose tissue {{that can lead}} to systemic insulin resistance. It is well known that insulin resistance correlates with inflammation of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in obese animals and humans. Decreasing inflammation in the <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> has been proven as a therapeutic strategy for improvement of insulin sensitivity in vivo. Numerous factors secreted by immune cells, including macrophages, have been suggested as regulating <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> insulin sensitivity. In the first part of my thesis, I describe the role of one such factor, CD 40 in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> inflammation. The CD 40 -CD 40 L dyad acts as co-stimulation in the interaction of antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, with effector cells, such as T cells, in adaptive immunity. We found that CD 40 knockout mice were smaller but surprisingly more insulin resistant and glucose intolerant compared to wild-type mice when fed a high fat diet. Consistent with their metabolic phenotype, knockout mice displayed increased <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> inflammation with infiltration of immune cells including macrophages and T cells. Consistent with increased inflammation, CD 40 knockout <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> displayed decreased lipid storage. Deficiency of CD 40 also led to increased lipid deposition in liver, which may be due to increased lipid release into circulation from the <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> as well as increased lipid synthesis in the liver. CD 40 knockout mice had increased hepatic insulin resistance and increased gluconeogensis despite decreased hepatic inflammation. These findings suggest that CD 40 is a novel regulator of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> inflammation in diet-induced obesity. In the second part of this thesis we examined perivascular <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> and brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> for the presence of inflammation. In contrast to visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> macrophage infiltration was absent in perivascular and brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> as defined by reduced F 480 + cells by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. We also found that perivascular <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> was similar to brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> as shown by gross morphology and gene expression pattern. Inflammatory gene expression was not increased in brown or perivascular <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in obese mice as determined by microarray gene expression analysis. These findings suggest that perivascular <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> is more similar to brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> than white <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> and that both perivascular and brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> are resistant to inflammation. We conclude that, (1) CD 40 protects against <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> inflammation in diet-induced obesity, (2) the CD 40 knockout mouse is an interesting model of hepatic steatosis with decreased inflammation and (3) perivascular <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> is almost identical to brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in obese mice and that both are resistant to inflammation...|$|R

30|$|Critical illness induces a hypercatabolic {{response}} {{with severe}} wasting of lean tissue [1, 2]. Remarkably, in non-obese patients, critical illness prioritizes {{the maintenance of}} <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> over skeletal muscle tissue [3]. Such preservation of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> mass during prolonged critical illness coincided with increased adipogenesis, as has been observed in subcutaneous and visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> biopsies of prolonged critically ill patients [4, 5]. Recently, we have shown in an animal and patient study that premorbid obesity protected against muscle wasting and weakness. Obese critically ill mice lost relatively more <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> mass than lean mice but ultimately retained more <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> [6]. These observations suggest that in overweight/obese critically ill patients, preservation of the <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> is not prioritized but that the stored lipids in the <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> are being used, which provokes a muscle-sparing effect [6]. Overall, these findings indicate an essential role for the <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> during critical illness but also suggest that different processes are ongoing in lean vs. overweight/obese critically ill patients. As it appears that having abundantly available <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> is beneficial during critical illness, an increase in adipogenesis {{could be interpreted as}} an attempt to ensure sufficient <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> during critical illness. However, as the muscle-sparing effect coincided with a decrease in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> mass, one could also interpret an increase in adipogenesis as an undesirable preservation of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> over the skeletal muscle. We therefore hypothesize that, to preserve <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> mass during critical illness, adipogenesis is increased in prolonged lean critically ill patients, but not in overweight/obese critically ill patients, who enter the intensive care unit (ICU) with excess <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b>|$|R

The cross-sectional and the follow-up studies showed that sKIM- 1 level was positively associated with RS <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> volume increase for both genders. FGF- 21 was positively associated with RS and retroperitoneal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> amount. Conclusions: Regardless of gender <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in RS accumulates asymmetrically–the left RS accumulates a significantly higher amount of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> Thus, primarily RS <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> effects should be assessed on the left kidney. Accumulation of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in the RS is related with the visceral adipose amount, KIM- 1 and FGF- 21 concentration increase in the blood serum...|$|R

This study investigated the association between directly measured visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> {{and the risk of}} EAC. In a case-control setting, we measured visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in patients with EAC and healthy controls. Visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> was determined by abdominal CT. Exclusion criteria were uninterpretable CT scans and severe comorbidity. Controls were healthy volunteers undergoing screening CT colonography. Cross-sectional areas of visceral and subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> were measured in cm(2) at L 3 /L 4. Values of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> of EAC patients were extrapolated to stage 0 and compared to controls. The association between visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> and EAC was calculated with least-squares regression, adjusted for age, sex and TNM stage. We included 175 EAC patients and 251 controls. While body mass index was similar in EAC patients (26. 1 kg/m(2)) and controls (26. 2 kg/m(2)), visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> was significantly higher in EAC patients at stage 0 than in controls (276 vs. 231 cm(2); p = 0. 015). Regarding subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> there was no difference. Patients with EAC have significantly higher visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> than healthy controls.

40|$|Obesity alters <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> {{metabolic}} and endocrine {{function and}} leads to an increased release of fatty acids, hormones, and proinflammatory molecules that contribute to obesity associated complications. To further characterize the changes that occur in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> with increasing adiposity, we profiled transcript expression in perigonadal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> from groups of mice in which adiposity varied due to sex, diet, and the obesity-related mutations agouti (Ay) and obese (Lepob). We found that the expression of 1, 304 transcripts correlated significantly with body mass. Of the 100 most significantly correlated genes, 30 % encoded proteins that are characteristic of macrophages and are positively correlated with body mass. Immunohistochemical analysis of perigonadal, perirenal, mesenteric, and subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> revealed {{that the percentage of}} cells expressing the macrophage marker F 4 / 80 (F 4 / 80 +) was significantly and positively correlated with both adipocyte size and body mass. Similar relationships were found in human subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> stained for the macrophage antigen CD 68. Bone marrow transplant studies and quantitation of macrophage number in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> from macrophage-deficient (Csf 1 op/op) mice suggest that these F 4 / 80 + cells are CSF- 1 dependent, bone marrow–derived <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> macrophages. Expression analysis of macrophage and nonmacrophage cell populations isolated from <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> demonstrates that <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> macrophages are responsible for almost all <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> TNF-α expression and significant amounts of iNOS and IL- 6 expression. <b>Adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> macrophage numbers increase in obesity and participate in inflammatory pathways that are activated in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> of obese individuals...|$|R
40|$|Whereas {{the role}} of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in glucose and lipid {{homeostasis}} is widely recognized, its role in systemic protein and amino acid metabolism is less well-appreciated. In vitro and ex vivo experiments suggest that <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> can metabolize substantial amounts of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs). However, {{the role of}} <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in regulating BCAA metabolism in vivo is controversial. Interest in the contribution of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> to BCAA metabolism has been renewed with recent observations demonstrating down-regulation of BCAA oxidation enzymes in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in obese and insulin-resistant humans. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we observe alterations in adipose-tissue BCAA enzyme expression caused by adipose-selective genetic alterations in the GLUT 4 glucose-transporter expression. We show {{that the rate of}} <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> BCAA oxidation per mg of tissue from normal mice is higher than in skeletal muscle. In mice overexpressing GLUT 4 specifically in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> we observe coordinate down-regulation of BCAA metabolizing enzymes selectively in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> This decreases BCAA oxidation rates in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> but not in muscle, in association with increased circulating BCAA levels. To confirm the capacity of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> to modulate circulating BCAA levels in vivo, we demonstrate that transplantation of normal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> into mice that are globally defective in peripheral BCAA metabolism reduces circulating BCAA levels by 30 % (fasting) - 50 % (fed state). These results demonstrate {{for the first time the}} capacity of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> to catabolize circulating BCAAs in vivo and that coordinate regulation of adipose-tissue BCAA enzymes may modulate circulating BCAA levels...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the presence of functional prolactin receptors (PRLRs) in white <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> of mice and humans, and the possible functions mediated via PRLRs. In mouse white <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> three PRLR mRNA isoforms, L-, S 2 -, and S 3 -PRLR, and L-PRLR protein expression were detected. In human subcutaneous abdominal and breast <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> four PRLR mRNA isoforms, L-, I-, S 1 a- and S 1 b-PRLR and PRLR proteins were detected. During lactation, mouse <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> L-PRLR mRNA expression increased. Moreover, in the <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> of prolactin (PRL) -transgenic mice with chronically elevated PRL levels, L-PRLR expression was also increased. Elevated serum testosterone increased L-PRLR expression in the <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> of male mice. However, inhibition of progesterone in late gestation increased L-PRLR expression in the mammary gland but not in the <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> To investigate whether adipocyte PRLRs are functional, mouse adipocytes were cultured in vitro and the direct effects of PRL on suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) expression and leptin secretion were investigated. PRL induced CIS mRNA expression in cultured adipocytes. Furthermore, PRL increased insulin-induced SOCS- 3 expression significantly more compared to insulin alone. The insulin-induced leptin secretion was suppressed by PRL. In mouse <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> in vivo, transient PRL stimulation induced SOCS- 3, CIS and SOCS- 2. In contrast, only SOCS- 2 was increased in the <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> after prolonged PRL exposure, as well as during pregnancy and lactation. In female PRL-transgenic mice, the retroperitoneal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> mass was reduced, serum leptin levels were elevated and <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> resistin expression was unchanged compared to controls. However, resistin expression was increased in untreated male PRL-transgenics. Male PRL-transgenics have elevated serum testosterone and testosterone's role in regulating resistin was therefore studied. Resistin was increased in the <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> of control mice with elevated testosterone, but not in castrated PRL-transgenic males, suggesting a role for testosterone in regulating resistin. In human <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> cultured in vitro, the direct effect of PRL on lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was investigated and PRL inhibited the LPL activity in the human <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> In conclusion, this study demonstrates that there are functional PRLRs in white <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> and PRL is an important regulator of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> metabolism in both humans and mice...|$|R

50|$|<b>Adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> macrophages (abbr.

40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} {{is often seen}} {{as a consequence of}} obesity and there are several possible links between <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> function and insulin resistance determined in other organs such as skeletal muscle or liver. One such link is the regulation of NEFA (non-esterified fatty acid) delivery {{to the rest of the}} body. Simplistically, an expanded <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> mass delivers more NEFA to the systemic circulation and these fatty acids compete for substrate utilization in skeletal muscle, which in turn reduces glucose utilization. This increases blood glucose concentration and provides the stimulus for increased insulin secretion and hyperinsulinaemia is a key feature of the insulin-resistance syndrome. However, there is abundant evidence that <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> is exquisitely insulin sensitive and hyperinsulinaemia may therefore lead to a constant lipolytic inhibition in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> Consequently, the main function of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> to rapidly switch between fat uptake and fat release, will be hampered. <b>Adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> blood flow is the conveyor of signals and substrates to and from the <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> In healthy people <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> blood flow is much enhanced by food intake, whereas in insulin-resistant subjects this response is blunted.

The aims of this study were the evaluation of 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> and subcutaneous adipose tissues and to determine eventual differences in patients with and without obesity. Material and Methods: Retrospective study of adult patients who underwent whole body 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/ computed tomography scanning between July and August of 2016. Statistical analysis: SPSS™ software v. 20. Statistical significance: p < 0. 05. Results: We assessed fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans from 156 patients (58. 3 % of males) {{with a mean age of}} 61. 0 ± 14. 1 years. Half of the patients had a body mass index ≥ 25. 0 kg/m 2  and 15. 4 % (n = 24) were obese. In both groups, the mean 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was higher in visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues.</b> There were no differences in 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> between the groups. Obese patients had lower density of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> both in subcutaneous <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> and in visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues.</b> Abdominal circumference and density of visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> had a positive predictive value in the mean 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues.</b>   Discussion: Through a non-invasive test, this study demonstrated a significant higher metabolic activity in visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> in both obese and non-obese patients. According to our results, abdominal circumference was an important determinant in 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in visceral <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues.</b> We also demonstrated that obese patients had differences in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> quality.

The present study characterises enzymes involved in ceramide metabolism in subcutaneous and intra-abdominal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> Methods Pathways leading to increased ceramide concentrations in inflamed versus non-inflamed <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> were investigated by quantifying expression levels of key enzymes involved in ceramide metabolism. Sphingomyelinases (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterases SMPD 1 - 3) were investigated further using immunohistochemistry {{to establish their}} location within <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> and their mRNA expression levels were determined in subcutaneous and intra-abdominal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> from both non-obese and obese subject. Results Gene expression levels of sphingomyelinases, enzymes that hydrolyse sphingomyelin to ceramide, rather than enzymes involved in de novo ceramide synthesis, were higher in inflamed compared to non-inflamed <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> of obese women (with high and normal liver fat contents respectively). Sphingomyelinases were localised to both macrophages and adipocytes, but also to blood vessels and to extracellular regions surrounding vessels within <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> Expression levels of SMPD 3 mRNA correlated significantly with concentrations of different ceramides and sphingomyelins.
