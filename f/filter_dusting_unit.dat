40|$|In the {{presence}} of insoluble metal oxides (industrial <b>filter</b> <b>dust,</b> zinc oxide, synthetic mixture of metal oxides), Penicillium simplicissimum developed the ability to excrete considerable amounts of citric acid (> 100 mM). Parallel {{with the increase of}} citric acid concentration in the culture broth, zinc was solubilized from zinc oxide. The adsorption of <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> onto the mycelium (the pellets formed were less than 1 mm in diameter) was required for not only the citric acid excretion but also the leaching of zinc. When the <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> was replaced with a synthetic mixture of metal oxides or with zinc oxide in combination with trace elements, levels of adsorption and citric acid production were observed to be similar to those in experiments where industrial <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> was used. The two most important properties of the <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> were its heavy-metal content and its buffering capacity. These properties were simulated by adding heavy metals in soluble form (as chlorides, sulfates, or nitrates) or soluble buffers to the medium. Both heavy metals and buffers were not able to induce a citric acid efflux. As with citric acid production by Aspergillus niger, the addition of manganese lowered citric acid excretion (by 40 % with metal oxide-induced citric acid efflux and by 100 % with urea-induced citric acid efflux). Copper antagonized the effect of manganese. The mechanism for the bulk of citric acid excretion by P. simplicissimum, however, seemed to be different from that described for citric acid accumulation by A. niger. Because of the inefficiency of metals in solubilized form and of soluble buffers to induce a strong citric acid efflux, adsorption of an insoluble metal compound (zinc oxide) turned out to be essential. Surface phenomena possibly involving the plasma membrane H+-ATPase are thought to participate in the induction of citric acid excretion by P. simplicissimum in {{the presence}} of industrial <b>filter</b> <b>dust...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the present {{research}} project {{is placed on the}} potential emission of heavy metals from raw materials from different substance cycles by water. Risk assessment is based on different leaching studies of waste products from the incineration of domestic refuse considering their disposal at appropriate sites or using them as construction materials. The investigations show that accumulation and leachability of heavy metals from slags derived from a muncipal waste incinerator depend on the combustion bed temperature. Combustion bed temperatures of 750 C- 1060 C were monitored by an IR-camera during three incineration experiments. Metals with comparatively low boiling points such as Cd, Pb and Zn predominately accumulate in the boiler ashes and <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> when the incinerator is operated at higher grate temperature. Furthermore, TOC-content as well as loss on ignition is lowered by 25 percent. Sequential elution experiments reveal that the leaching rate of heavy metals is mainly driven by pH. Solid phase investigations indicate the formation of three evident phase components in the slag. The phase components are matrix unmolten, matrix molten and metal pellets. The metal pellets also {{can be found in the}} boiler ash. The measurement of PCDD/PCDF and <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> shows large variations. Slags are contaminated relatively low, while contamination of boiler ash and <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> is very high. To sum up, it has been demonstrated that increasing combustion bed temperature leads to a better quality of slgas with regard to environmental compatibility. Nevertheless, the possible recycling of slag materials should be bound to further investigations.

40|$|Evaporation {{processes}} generally {{occurring in}} glass melting furnaces are undesirable phenomena. Volatile glass components like sodium or boron evaporate from batch and glass melt. Their loss does {{not only have}} an effect on glass composition, homogeneity and quality, but also makes flue gas filters behind glass melting tanks indispensable. Although the operation of these filters is often based on long experience and collected empirical data, filter corrosion or slip-through of components can still lead to enormous problems. In boron containing flue gases, the main difficulties during filter operation are the slip-through of the gaseous species (HBO 2) n and H 3 BO 3 and the back-reaction of already precipitated <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> to gaseous species. This study focuses on the thermodynamic and kinetic conditions in flue gases consisting of combustion gases, sodium, boron and sulphur compounds. To identify the reaction mechanisms in flue gases, results from thermodynamic calculations, kinetic experiments and the analysis of industrial <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> are combined. The obtained data may be used to adjust filter operation {{in such a way that}} the above mentioned problems are avoided. In sulphur free flue gases, the possible species are NaBO 2, KBO 2, Na 2 B 4 O 7 and H 3 BO 3. In sulphur containing gases Na 2 SO 4, NaHSO 4, Na 3 (HSO 4) (SO 4) and K 3 Na(SO 4) 2 will form. Sodium and potassium borates and sulfates form condensates that can easily be precipitated between 400 and 200 °C. Only if boron has no alkaline reaction partner, can it pass the filters as gaseous species. In this case, boron will condensate as H 3 BO 3. The condensation temperatures of each species depend on the partial pressure of the compound in the flue gas. For a typical partial pressure of PH 3 BO 3 = 1 ∙ 10 - 4 bar H 3 BO 3 will condensate below 87 °C. The analysis of industrial <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> in combination with thermodynamic calculations shows, that condensation of compounds from flue gas will occur in the following order:Na 2 SO 4 -NaF-CaSO 4 -NaxByOz-Na 2 CO 3 -CaF 2 -NaOH-CaxByOz-CaCO 3 -Ca(OH) 2 The formation of the salts of sulphuric or hydrofluoric acid is preferred. The back-reaction from <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> results from the reaction of precipitated species with acid components. As the mixing energy of the phases in the row above increases from left to right, SO 3, F, B 2 O 3, CO 3 and H 2 O can be disposed by any species positioned left in the row...|$|R

Vsebnost kovin smo analizirali v vzorcih iz Taluma d. d in Impola d. d. Analizirali smo žlindro in filtrni prah iz livarne Talum d. o. o., ter filtrni prah iz livarne Impol. Laboratorijska vzorca filtrnega prahu iz Taluma d. o. o. in Impola d. o. o. smo pripravili po celotnem postopku, torej pripravili zatehto suhe snovi, izvedli izluževanje, filtriranje, razklop in na koncu izvedli meritev z indultivno sklopljeno plazmo in masno spektrometrijo (ICP – MS). Vzorec žlindre iz livarne Talum d. o. o. pa je v obliki izlužka, tako da smo naredili še razklop s HNO 3 ali z zlatotopko in nato izvedli meritve.

Laboratory samples of <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> from the Talum and Impol plants were prepared for analysis. We carried out the processes of leaching, filtration and separation.

The contamination of these installations with heavy metals e. g. mercury and NORM requires an ecologically disposal concept. The Continental Netherlands Oil Company B. V. (CONOCO) has shift their Kotter and Logger platform to a new owner. For treatment of residual NORM contaminated process equipment CONOCO was looking for alternatives to the expensive and time consuming traditional decontamination technique of hydro blasting combined with state of the art gamma detection equipment, which result in the decision to melt these material in the special melting plant at Siempelkamp.

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{industrial}} survey {{was performed on}} the secondary products generated in the Dutch metal industry. From this industrial survey it was concluded that the Dutch metal industry is already far ahead with closing the materials cycle as for almost every product is a processing route to recover its metal content. The residues generated at LDM BV, a secondary brass producer located in Drunen, are currently being processed by a different company; however in their goal to have a zero footprint on the environment LDM BV (hereafter referred to as LDM) is looking for opportunities to process the secondary products on site. Two different kinds of products are generated at LDM; a <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> containing around 80 % ZnO, 8 % C, 4 % Cu and 1. 5 % Pb and a slag containing various amounts of copper ~ 45 % and zinc ~ 40 % in metallic and oxide form. A study {{was performed on the}} processing techniques available to process zinc containing residues and from this study several treatment options were designed and tested in the lab. The main focus was put on the recovery of zinc from the LDM <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> as this is the first goal the company has set itself, however since the nature of the two materials is similar a combined treatment of both materials was investigated as well. First the pyrometallurgical reduction by utilizing the carbon contained in the LDM <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> was tested at 1200 oC. It was found that a maximum of 97 % of the zinc could be recovered; a higher recovery at 1200 oC was not possible as the remaining zinc was bound to gahnite (ZnAl 2 O 4). The residue still contained 15 % ZnO and did not form a slag. A combined reduction of both the <b>filter</b> <b>dust</b> and melting slag resulted in the recovery of 96. 8 % of the copper, 99. 9 % of the zinc (as ZnO) and 64. 9 % of the lead. This test was performed at 1400 oC and it was found that at this temperature the gahnite would be reduced. Also by addition of lime and silica a suitable slag was formed which contained 2. 18 % CuO and 0. 16 % ZnO. Both the copper and zinc oxide produced had a purity of over 98 %. Hydrometallurgical treatment was tested by using two different leaching agents, NaOH and H 2 SO 4. It was found that the best leaching conditions for NaOH at a liquid solid ratio of 10 were 90 oC using 320 g/L NaOH. After 15 minutes the maximum amount of zinc was already leached and total of 86 % was leached. Lead was leached for 68 % and Copper for 5 %. Using 200 g/L H 2 SO 4 at 65 oC resulted in 96 % of all the zinc to be leached and 90. 5 % of all the copper. Both residues contained mainly gahnite which is impossible to leach under atmospheric conditions. After an iron removal step for the acidic solution both leach liquors were purified with Zn dust cementation. A zinc product of 99. 7 % purity was produced through electrowinning for both solutions; however the power consumption for the NaOH solution was significantly lower at 2. 2 kWh/kg opposed to 3. 04 kWh/kg zinc produced Finally a conceptual flow sheet is given for both a pyrometallurgical and a (sulfuric acid) hydrometallurgical processing facility in a brass smelting plant.
