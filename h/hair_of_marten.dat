40|$|To examine multi-annual {{variations}} in the food habits <b>of</b> the Japanese <b>marten</b> (Martes melampus), we analyzed the composition <b>of</b> <b>marten</b> feces in the Bonbori Forest Path in western Tokyo, central Japan, in two time periods a decade apart (1997 – 1998 and 2007 – 2008). The staple foods <b>of</b> <b>martens</b> in both periods were fruits/seeds and animal materials (mainly insects and mammals). The martens fed frequently on fruits/seeds and insects throughout the year in both periods, but the consumption of mammals, birds, and arthropods/other animals showed seasonal variations. The composition of fruits/seeds {{and the frequency of}} occurrence for each fruit-bearing species differed between the two periods. These results suggest that both the foraging strategy and role <b>of</b> <b>martens</b> as a seed dispersal agent changes yearly, presumably according to multi-annual variation in the availability of prey animals and/or fruits. We emphasize the importance of multi-annual studies both on food habits and to monitor food availability in the temperate region where the food environment changes among seasons, as well as years...|$|R
