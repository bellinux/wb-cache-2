40|$|With food, {{consumers}} often face {{a trade-off}} between taste and nutrition. A priori, {{it is not}} obvious which would be {{more important to the}} average consumer, so it is an empirical question how consumers value <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> that simultaneously affect taste and nutritional value. In this paper, Swedish consumer preferences regarding <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> in breakfast cereals, hard bread and potato products are analyzed. In particular, the value consumers attach to fat, fibre, salt and sugar is studied, as well as the value of easily accessible nutritional information provided by a nutrition symbol. The equations estimated are derived from a hedonic price model. The price data originates from a household panel and scanner data, whereas the corresponding data on <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> was collected manually in supermarkets or from producers. The value consumers attach to <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> are found to vary by product and the results also imply that these values could be sensitive to changes in the combination of characteristics in a product. hedonic pricing; willingness to pay; <b>food</b> <b>characteristics...</b>|$|E

40|$|When {{domestic}} ruminants {{are faced}} with food diversity, they can use pre-ingestive information (i. e. <b>food</b> sensory <b>characteristics</b> perceived by the animal before swallowing the food) and post-ingestive information (i. e. digestive and metabolic consequences, experienced by the animal after swallowing the food) to evaluate the food and make decisions to select a suitable diet. The concept of palatability is essential to understand how pre- and post-ingestive information are interrelated. It refers to the hedonic value of the food without any immediate effect of post-ingestive consequences and environmental factors, but with the influence of individual characteristics, such as animal’s genetic background, internal state and previous experiences. In the literature, the post-ingestive consequences are commonly considered as the main force that influences feeding behaviour whereas <b>food</b> sensory <b>characteristics</b> are only used as discriminatory agents. This discriminatory role is indeed important for animals {{to be aware of}} their feeding environment, and ruminants are able to use their different senses either singly or in combination to discriminate between different foods. However, numerous studies on ruminants’ feeding behaviour demonstrate that the role of <b>food</b> sensory <b>characteristics</b> has been underestimated or simplified; they could play at least two other roles. First, some sensory characteristics also possess a hedonic value which influences ruminants’ intake, preferences and food learning independently of any immediate post-ingestive consequences. Further, diversity of <b>food</b> sensory <b>characteristics</b> has a hedonic value, as animals prefer an absence of monotony in <b>food</b> sensory <b>characteristics</b> at similar post-ingestive consequences. Second, some of these <b>food</b> sensory <b>characteristics</b> become an indicator of post-ingestive consequences after their initial hedonic value has acquired a positive or a negative value via previous individual food learning or evolutionary processes. These <b>food</b> sensory <b>characteristics</b> thus represent cues that could help ruminants to anticipate the post-ingestive consequences of a food and to improve their learning efficiency, especially in complex environments. This review then suggests that <b>food</b> sensory <b>characteristics</b> could be of importance to provide pleasure to animals, to increase palatability of a food and to help them learn in complex feeding situations which could improve animal welfare and productivity...|$|R

40|$|Transportation {{activities}} are often highlighted for their climate impact, and one {{industry that has}} a significant impact is the food industry. However, reducing the climate impact of transporting food products can be difficult due to the various characteristics of such products, for example temperature regime. These characteristics also influence shippers’ ability to create efficient logistics systems. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} thesis is to understand the role of <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> for efficient logistics in order to enable shippers of food products to reduce the climate impact of transportation. The thesis is a compilation of three papers: (1) a literature review of food logistics in order to study how food aspects have been considered within logistics literature; (2) an interview study to identify links between <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> and logistics systems; and (3) a case study to create a framework for reducing the climate impact of transportation by considering <b>food</b> <b>characteristics.</b> To stress the importance of creating frameworks that can be adjusted to the wide range of <b>food</b> <b>characteristics,</b> the findings are analysed with the help of fundamental assumptions of contingency theory. In combination, the three papers constitute a framework for the link between <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> and climate impact of transportation. First, the framework identifies nine <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> and describes links between these characteristics and logistics performance variables. Second, the framework describes how to identify product flow characteristics (including <b>food</b> <b>characteristics)</b> for shipments and analyses how these product flow characteristics influence variables for reducing the climate impact. Finally, to guide shippers to make efficient decisions to reduce the climate impact of transportation, this study demonstrates how shipments can be categorised {{with the help of a}} portfolio approach. The thesis explains how to consider the context, both in terms of the physical products and the physical flows, when creating efficient food logistics for reducing the climate impact of transportation. For shippers of food products, the findings of this thesis can be applied to problematising the challenge of transporting a wide variety of products with different <b>food</b> <b>characteristics...</b>|$|E

Using the cuisine concept, we propose a more comprehensive approach to the study of fast <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> and availability, while taking cultural context into account. The objectives of this paper are to explore the usefulness of the cuisine concept and to provide some insight into fast <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> and its availability in the Greater Accra Region (GAR) of Ghana. We used quantitative and qualitative approaches to obtaine data from restaurateurs and consumers in GAR. The study showed that fast food in GAR comprised “globally recognized popular fast foods” including French fries, pizzas, and fried rice, and some traditional Ghanaian foods such as jollof rice, banku with tilapia, and kelewele. The foods, usually hot and spicy, were mainly obtained from restaurants and check-check vendors, eaten with cutlery, fingers or both, together with a drink, and mostly in the company of other people. In total, 68 % of restaurants in GAR were fast food restaurants. The cuisine concept enabled us to explore more fast <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> than what were done in previous studies. The availability of fast foods signals the need for more research to improve our understanding of its contribution to food security and its link with health, culture and environment. We encourage researchers to explore the cuisine concept and identify new significant research questions for advancing the field of food studies...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn social insects, the {{decision}} to exploit a food source is made both at the individual (e. g., a worker collecting a food item) and colony level (e. g., several workers communicating {{the existence of a}} food patch). In group recruitment, the recruiter lays a temporary chemical trail while returning from the food source to the nest and returns to the food guiding a small group of nestmates. We studied how <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> influence {{the decision}}-making process of workers changing from individual retrieving to group recruitment in the gypsy ant Aphaenogaster senilis. We offered field colonies three types of prey: crickets (cooperatively transportable), shrimps (non-transportable), and different quantities of sesame seeds (individually transportable). Colonies used group recruitment to collect crickets and shrimps, as well as seeds when they were available in large piles, while small seed piles rarely led to recruitment. Foragers were able to “measure” <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> (quality, quantity, transportability), deciding whether or not to recruit, accordingly. Social integration of individual information about food emerged as a colony decision to initiate or to continue recruitment when the food patch was rich. In addition, group recruitment allowed a fast colony response over a wide thermal range (up to 45 °C ground temperature). Therefore, by combining both advantages of social foraging (group recruitment) and thermal tolerance, A. senilis accurately exploited different types of food sources which procured an advantage against mass-recruiting and behaviorally dominant species such as Tapinoma nigerrimum and Lasius niger...|$|E

40|$|Preservation of {{skeletal}} muscle mass {{is of great}} importance for maintaining both metabolic health and functional capacity. Muscle mass maintenance is regulated by the balance between muscle protein breakdown and synthesis rates. Both muscle protein breakdown and synthesis rates {{have been shown to}} be highly responsive to physical activity and food intake. Food intake, and protein ingestion in particular, directly stimulates muscle protein synthesis rates. The postprandial muscle protein synthetic response to feeding is regulated on a number of levels, including dietary protein digestion and amino acid absorption, splanchnic amino acid retention, postprandial insulin release, {{skeletal muscle}} tissue perfusion, amino acid uptake by muscle, and intramyocellular signaling. The postprandial muscle protein synthetic response to feeding is blunted in many conditions characterized by skeletal muscle loss, such as aging and muscle disuse. Therefore, it is important to define <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> that modulate postprandial muscle protein synthesis. Previous work has shown that the muscle protein synthetic response to feeding can be modulated by changing the amount of protein ingested, the source of dietary protein, as well as the timing of protein consumption.

Only few studies have investigated the postprandial muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of protein dense foods, such as dairy and meat.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of feeding behaviour of ruminants would help optimising the use of forages by these animals and improve their zootechnical performances, including welfare, and environmental interests. We studied the role of sensory characteristics of food in qualitative (diet selection) and quantitative (intake) aspects of feeding behaviour in sheep. Thus far these characteristics {{are believed to have}} only a discriminating role. We studied their role at similar post-ingestive consequences, on the one, and their role at different post-ingestive consequences, using food learning paradigms, on the other hand. At similar post-ingestive consequences, sensory <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> did not influence voluntary daily intake but they influenced i/ short term intake when the motivation to eat induced by the food overruled the satiety state of the animal, and ii/ feeding activities (time spent eating and intake rate). Interestingly, results differed according to quality contrasts between food items. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact role of sensory characteristics in the regulation of voluntary intake. Sensory characteristics influenced also food preferences when they possessed a hedonic or an a priori value subjectively indicating positive or negative consequences to the animal. The influence of the hedonic value was however difficult to analyse because of a great inter-individual variability in animal response. The hedonic value was furthermore influenced by the context of food presentation; a non preferred food item could become preferred if it was not recently consumed, which indicates an attraction for food diversity and especially for a change in food. During food learning, the hedonic value of sensory characteristics modulates the animal's ability to associate them with post-ingestive consequences. When sensory <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> had acquired an a priori value, animals could use them as indicators of post-ingestive consequences. Consequently, they allowed animals to be more efficient in food learning, notably in complex environments, via a generalisation process. Our work is thus reinforcing the validity of the food learning theory in complex environments. Some primary tastes, such umami and bitter tastes, possess an a priori value (positive and negative, respectively). It is expected that these tastes have a role as indicator. In conclusion, sensory <b>food</b> <b>characteristics,</b> because of their role as discriminator, their hedonic value or their role as indicator, influenced different aspects of feeding behaviour in sheep. Therefore, sensory <b>food</b> <b>characteristics</b> have the possibility to improve the use of forage in animal diets and to a certain extent, ameliorate farm animal welfare. Nous nous sommes intéressés au rôle des caractéristiques sensorielles des aliments dans les aspects qualitatifs (sélection) et quantitatifs (ingestion) du comportement alimentaire des ovins. Indépendamment des conséquences post-ingestives d'une part, et en interaction avec les conséquences post-ingestives dans les processus d'apprentissage alimentaire d'autre part. A conséquences similaires, les caractéristiques sensorielles n'ont pas influencé l'ingestion journalière mais ont influencé i/ l'ingestion à court-terme via une modification de l'équilibre entre motivation et rassasiement, et ii/ les durées et vitesses d'ingestion. Certaines caractéristiques sensorielles possèdent une valeur hédonique voire une valeur latente potentiellement indicatrice des conséquences, et influencent la sélection. Lors des apprentissages, la valeur hédonique de ces caractéristiques module la propension des animaux à les associer aux conséquences.
