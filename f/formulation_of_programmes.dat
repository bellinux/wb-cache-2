40|$|The trainability {{of youth}} at {{specific}} periods during growth and maturation {{has become a}} key issue in paediatric exercise science. The development of physical capacities such as movement speed, strength and power is difficult to predict in youth meaning that the structuring of training can be a significant challenge for coaches. Accordingly, methodologically sound research is required to underpin a more informed approach to the <b>formulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> of physical development. To this end, {{the purpose of this}} work was to investigate the trainability of youth athletes at specific stages during maturation (pre-, mid-, and post-peak height velocity) by addressing some of the shortcomings of the existing body of literature. Short-term controlled interventions were undertaken and they extended from the findings of three meta-analytical reviews, all of which examined the effect of training on the development of speed, strength and power in youths aged 9 to 18. These investigations were focused on the manipulation of modifiable factors, such as the training stimulus, as opposed to non-modifiable factors, such as maturity (which was generally controlled for). With some exceptions, which are potentially explainable, speed, strength and power were, on the whole, more trainable in youths as they advanced in maturation with the mid-peak height velocity phase being a particularly important time for the development of these capacities. This could indicate the presence of a maturational threshold which moderates responses to training but this can also be coincident with a period of impaired performance potentially related to reduced motor control due to rapid growth rates. Because of the way speed, strength and power can develop in youth athletes, the pre-peak height velocity phase of development may be more conducive to neuromuscular training with a coordinative component which establishes the movement competency required for more advanced techniques. An intensification of resistance (strength) training can be of benefit during mid-peak height velocity though impaired movement or a higher susceptibility to injury could compel coaches to reduce sprint (speed) and/or plyometric (power) training at this time. During the post-peak height velocity phase, athletes can be transitioned to more advanced training techniques, that are traditionally used with adults, if they possess the necessary coordination and experience to do so. Regardless of the results in this work, at every stage of development it is important for coaches to make programming decisions for youth athletes based, primarily, on training age and movement competency with the above maturity-related recommendations being suitable for those who have been exposed to high quality training from an early age...|$|E

Unique challenges face nurses functioning in the stressful surgical environment where anticipation to prevent or cope with life-threatening situations is the order of the day. The operating room nurse must be knowledgeable, skilled and alert, as he/she is held accountable for all acts of commission and omission. To ensure that nurses are appropriately educated and trained and able to keep trend with the changing technology in the operating room, it is essential that learning programmes meet the minimum standards for registration as prescribed by the South African Nursing Council. Reviewing and evaluating learning programmes on a regular basis by specialist nursing educationists, are therefore essential to ensure that the standards of education and training are maintained and upgraded if required. The aim of this study is to explore and describe the various Operating Room Nursing Science Learning Programmes offered at accredited Higher Education Institutions, utilized for the education and training {{of the operating}} room nursing students in South Africa. The proposed research is based on a qualitative paradigm and the theoretical grounding is found in Bergman’s model for professional accountability (Bergman, 1982 : 8). A document analysis of five approved comprehensive Operating Room Nursing Science Learning Programmes from higher education institutions in South Africa (nursing colleges and universities) was carried out, together with a sixth programme, the Operating Theatre Learning Programme, as suggested by the Standard Generating Body. Requests for permission were forwarded to the management of the selected colleges or universities for inclusion of the respective programmes in the study. The researcher formulated and utilized thirty-four essential criteria derived from three documents, the first being a document entitled “Proposed Standards for Nursing and Midwifery Qualifications” submitted to the SANC and SAQA by the SGB for Nursing and Midwifery (2001 - 2004). The second document entitled the Public and Private Higher Education Institutions format template for criteria for the Generation and Evaluation of Qualifications and Standards within the National Qualifications Framework was also utilized (SAQA, 1430 / 00) and thirdly the researcher included the most relevant criteria from the list of criteria for curriculum development as indicated by the South African Nursing Council. Various tables were compiled, to reflect the findings of the document analysis according to the thirty-three criteria indicated above, to provide a clear and broad overview of the specific data in the respective six Operating Room Nursing Science Learning Programmes utilized in the study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the nature and potential of an integrated strategy for non-formal education and development that will alleviate the problem of milieu-deprivation in Third World communities. This integrated strategy includes compensatory education, community development, and development communication strategies. Learning need structures were investigated {{and the most important}} categories of learning needs that exist in socially disadvantaged communities were identified. Community education is a relatively new concept, through which innovation, adaptation and extension of educational opportunities can be achieved, and thus suggests the most suitable infrastructure for the integration of educational and developmental strategies, namely compensatory education, community development and development communication. Community education can be defined as the educational process in which the provisions (services, <b>programmes,</b> resources) <b>of</b> all the educational agencies in a community are utilised in a co-operative and co-ordinated manner, to provide for all of the learning needs of all the people of a community, to develop the community and solve the problems of the community. The milieu-deprived Third World communities of the world are thus depend en t on community education. I n the present practice of community education, the community school serves as community learning centre, and becomes {{the focal point of the}} community whereby the school functions as a centre and delivery system for lifelong learning and community development. The operation <b>of</b> educational <b>programmes</b> is realized through a ten phase process. The appointment of a Director of Education, creating an educational milieu and the establishment of an organizational structure for participative planning, establish the necessary infrastructure for community education. The planning and bringing into operation <b>of</b> educational <b>programmes</b> takes place in the next six phases, namely: identification and analysis of problems and needs, <b>formulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>programme</b> objectives, identification and mobilization of community resources, operation <b>of</b> educational <b>programmes,</b> evaluation, and continuous research. The community education process can be implemented for the integration <b>of</b> all the <b>programmes,</b> practices, projects, and learning experiences of compensatory education, community development and development communicaton. The following categories of compensatory education can be realized in a community education set-up: pre-school educational programmes and parent education work-study programmes for youths higher education and adult education counselling reading and language education extracurricular innovations In dealing with community education, one is dealing with a community development strategy: a comprehensive community development strategy is actualised through some variation of the co-ordinating, co-operating process of community education. The following development communication strategies can be implemented and realised in a community education set-up: the open broadcasting strategy, the organised group strategy, multimedia strategy. Through the integration of the above-mentioned strategies within a community education set-up, with its network of educational agencies and social services, the problems of mi 1 ieu-deprived communities can be alleviated to a meaningful extent.

Thus on the central government tier several organs have been instituted, within the government or attached to it, which manage the national economy {{on behalf of the}} Cabinet. In People’s Poland that function was assigned to a numerous group of deputy premiers or else to the Presidium of the Cabinet, or to the Economic Committee of the Cabinet and the Planning Committee, and in the years 1981 - 1982 there was an Economic Committee of the Cabinet. In the assumptions of the economic reform a radical change of the existing system of subjects of management has been admitted towards a socialisation of management, restriction and change of the role of administration in management. Also the directions of changes in the position of the Cabinet in managing the national economy have been laid out. In the years 1981 - 1985 several changes realising the assumptions of the economic reform have been made. First they referred to the economic subjects and representative organs, and only indirectly to the administration and in particular the Cabinet. Essentially the position of the Cabinet in management has been changed.
