40|$|On {{the basis}} of a "Punctual" Equivalence Principle of the general {{relativity}} context, we consider spacetimes with measurements of conformally invariant physical properties. Then, applying the Pfaff theory for PDE to a particular conformally equivariant system of differential equations, we make explicit the dependence of any kind of function describing a "spacetime deployment", on n(n+ 1) parametrizing functions, denoting by n the spacetime dimension. These functions, appearing in a linear differential Spencer sequence and determining gauge fields of spacetime deformations relatively to a "substrat spacetime", can be consistently ascribed to unified electromagnetic and gravitational fields, at any spacetime dimensions n greater or equal to 4.

40|$|Abstract − − It is not {{possible}} to exchange parametric information of CAD models based on the current version of STEP. The design intent can be lost during the STEP transfer of CAD models. The Parametrics Group of ISO/TC 184 /SC 4 has proposed the SMCH schema, which includes constructs for exchange of parametric information. This paper proposes a macroparametric approach that is intended to provide capabilities to transfer parametric information including design intents. In this approach, CAD models are exchanged in the form of <b>macro</b> <b>files.</b> The <b>macro</b> <b>file</b> contains the history of user commands, which are used in the modeling phase. To exchange CAD models using the macro-parametric approach, the modeling commands of several commercial CAD systems are analyzed. Those commands are classified and a set of standard modeling commands has been defined. Mapping relations between the standard modeling commands and the native modeling commands of commercial CAD systems are defined. The scope of the current version is limited to parts modeling, not assemblies...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} active-sterile neutrino conversions in {{the early}} universe hot plasma {{in the presence of a}} random magnetic field generated at the electroweak phase transition. Within a random field domain the magnetization asymmetry of the lepton antilepton plasma produced by a uniform constant magnetic field is huge in contrast to their small density asymmetry, leading to a drastic change in the active-sterile conversion rates. Assuming that the random field provides the seed for the galactic field one can estimate the restrictions from primordial nucleosynthesis. Requiring that the extra sterile does not enter in equilibrium with the active ones before nucleosynthesis we find limits of the oscillation parameters which are stronger than in the isotropic case.

This is especially true in developing nations, were the levels of computer literacy are low requiring an even greater effort to acquire the skills necessary to customise Greenstone.

We generalize our recent work on the relations of operator product algebra (OPA) structure constants of sl(2) theories with the Pasquier algebra attached to the graph.

Finally, we study the top Yukawa coupling (h_t) evolution whose initial value is determined in terms of the common gauge coupling at the string scale.

However, it has been highlighted that {{the performance of the}} algorithms depends on the characteristics of the railway system in question. For example, the frequency of station stops could significantly affect the algorithm performance and suitability. Two major areas for further work are therefore to examine this performance using datasets from other railway systems and also to develop and compare the performance of algorithms based on other characteristics, such as speed limits rather than station stops. Further development work for the algorithms already developed could include hybridisation of the filtering and sequence-based algorithms, along with the index <b>file</b> <b>macros,</b> to further automate the process and reduce the amount of manual work required.

40|$|Abstract: Ideally, {{any change}} that modifies the similar {{parts of a}} cloned code snippet should be {{propagated}} to all its duplicates. In practice however, consistent propagation of changes in clones does not always happen. Current evidence indi-cates that clone families have a 50 % chance of having consistent changes. This paper measures cloning and co-changes at file level as a proxy to assess the fre-quency of consistent changes. Given that changes to a clone group are not necessar-ily propagated in the same commit transaction (i. e., late propagations), our analysis uses macro co-changes instead of the traditional definition of co-changes. Macro changes group bursts of changes that are closer among themselves than to other changes, regardless of author or message. Then, macro co-changes are sets of files that change in the same macro changes. Each cloned file is tagged depending on whether any of the files with which it macro co-changes is cloned with it (during the macro change) or not. Contrary to previous results, we discovered {{that most of the}} cloned <b>files</b> <b>macro</b> co-change only with files with which they share clones.
