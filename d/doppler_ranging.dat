A relatively new interferometric tracking technique under development is Connected Element Interferometry (CEI), which uses a single frequency standard, distributed to two antennas spaced 10 to 100 km apart, to make highly accurate measurements of the phase-delay of incoming radio signals. The angular navigation accuracies attainable with <b>Doppler,</b> <b>range,</b> CEI, and VLBI data strategies are compared, using simple analytic models for these data types. The measurement accuracies assumed for <b>Doppler,</b> <b>range,</b> and VLBI data represent the performance expected from these systems in the Magellan and Galileo missions, while the assumed CEI data accuracy represents the anticipated performance of an experimental connected element system being constructed at the Deep Space Network's Goldstone, California complex. The results indicate that the Galileo VLBI system can deliver 20 - to 25 -nrad accuracy throughout the ecliptic plane. A hypothetical CEI dual-baseline sysem at Goldstone yielded accuracies in the 35 - to 50 -nrad range, while another hypothetical Goldstone-based system, consisting of a single CEI baseline and an X-band (8. 4 GHz) Doppler system, produced accuracies of 25 to 100 nrad. Angular accuracies obtained from <b>Doppler</b> and <b>range</b> were found to be highly dependent upon the sensitivity of earth-spacecraft differential acceleration to small changes in geocentric spacecraft position...|$|R

40|$|Conventional FMCW radar {{principle}} {{was implemented}} on Symeo 61 GHz LPR®- 1 DHP-R radar sensor system. There were few {{limitations of the}} FMCW implementation which needed to be removed. First, target separation in multi target environment was not possible for objects at same distance. For example, there are two targets, one is moving and one is static. When the moving target approaches the static target and becomes parallel to static target, which means {{they are at the}} same distance. At this point, the system is unable to distinguish between two targets. Second, high resolution in velocity measurement was needed. To overcome these limitations <b>Range</b> <b>Doppler</b> Signal Processing was proposed. For the implementation of the <b>Range</b> <b>Doppler</b> algorithm, first of all proof of concept is needed. Simulations are performed using MATLAB to simulate <b>Range</b> <b>Doppler</b> algorithm using raw data from the sensor. After successful simulation, prototype is developed using python. This also provides the real time visualization of <b>Range</b> <b>Doppler</b> signal processing along with peak detection with distance and velocity measurements. With the <b>Range</b> <b>Doppler</b> implementation, separation between static and moving target becomes possible. Later the algorithm is implemented on Texas Instrument DSP in C considering the resource limitations of the target hardware. To validate the <b>Range</b> <b>Doppler</b> implementation and to determine the measurements accuracy, multiple test setups are created. Two main local testing environments have been setup, linear unit and turntable. The system is tested on these environments for different velocities and distances along with multiple targets and on different surfaces.

40|$|Navigation of deep-space probes is {{accomplished}} {{through a variety}} of different radio observables, namely <b>Doppler,</b> <b>ranging</b> and Delta-Differential One-Way Ranging (Delta-DOR). The particular mix of observations used for navigation mainly depends on the available on-board radio system, the mission phase and orbit determination requirements. The accuracy of current ESA and NASA tracking systems is at level of 0. 1 mais at 60 s integration time for Doppler, 1 to 5 m for ranging and 6 to 15 nrad for Delta-DOR measurements {{in a wide range of}} operational conditions. The ASTRA study, funded under ESA's General Studies Programme (GSP), addresses the ways to improve the end-to-end accuracy of <b>Doppler,</b> <b>ranging</b> and Delta-DOR systems by roughly a factor of 10. The target accuracies were set to 0. 01 mm/s at 60 s integration time for Doppler, 20 cm for ranging and 1 nrad for Delta-DOR. The companies and universities that took part in the study were the University of Rome Sapienza, ALMASpace, BAE Systems and Thales Alenia Space Italy. The analysis of an extensive data set of radio-metric observables and dedicated tests of the ground station allowed consolidating the error budget for each measurement technique. The radio-metric data set comprises X/X, X/Ka and Ka/Ka range and Doppler observables from the Cassini and Rosetta missions. It includes also measurements from the Advanced Media Calibration System (AMCS) developed by JPL for the radio science experiments of the Cassini mission. The error budget for the three radio-metric observables was consolidated by comparing the statistical properties of the data set with the expected error models. The analysis confirmed the contribution from some error sources, but revealed also some discrepancies and ultimately led to improved error models. The error budget reassessment provides adequate information for building guidelines and strategies to effectively improve the navigation accuracies of future deep space missions. We report both on updated error budget for radio-metric observables and the system configurations proposed for the upgrade of ESA's tracking and orbit determination systems...|$|E

During the 157 years to 2016, the precisions and accuracies of laboratory and space experiments, and of astrophysical and cosmological observations on relativistic gravity have been improved by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude. The improvements have been mainly from optical observations at first followed by radio observations. The achievements for the past 50 years are from radio Doppler tracking and radio ranging together with lunar laser ranging. At the present, the radio observations and lunar laser ranging experiments are similar in the accuracy of testing relativistic gravity. We review and summarize the present status of solar-system tests of relativistic gravity. With planetary laser ranging, spacecraft laser ranging and interferometric laser ranging (laser <b>Doppler</b> <b>ranging)</b> together with the development of drag-free technology, the optical observations will improve the accuracies by another 3 - 4 orders of magnitude in both the equivalence principle tests and solar-system dynamics tests of relativistic gravity.
