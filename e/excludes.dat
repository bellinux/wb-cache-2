One solution circle <b>excludes</b> the given circles that are enclosed by its conjugate solution, and vice versa.

The two conjugate solution circles are related by inversion, by the following argument.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} locally <b>excluded</b> minors.

We show that first-order model-checking is fixedparameter tractable on any class of graphs locally <b>excluding</b> a minor. This strictly generalises analogous results by Flum and Grohe on <b>excluded</b> minor classes and Frick and Grohe on classes with bounded local tree-width. As an important consequence of the proof we obtain fixed-parameter algorithms for problems such as dominating or independent set on graph classes <b>excluding</b> a minor, where now the parameter is the size of the dominating set and the <b>excluded</b> minor. We also study graph classes with <b>excluded</b> minors, where the minor may grow slowly with the size of the graphs and show that again, first-order model-checking is fixed-parameter tractable on any such class of graphs...|$|R
