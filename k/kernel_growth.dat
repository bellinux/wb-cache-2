40|$|Past {{research}} on <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> in wheat (Triticum aestivum) {{has shown that}} the kernel itself largely regulates the influx of sucrose for consequent starch synthesis in the endosperm of the grain. The first step in the conversion of sucrose to starch is catalyzed by sucrose synthase (EC 2. 4. 13). Sucrose synthase activity was assayed in developing endosperms from kernels differing in growth rate and in maximum dry weight accumulation. From 10 to 22 days after anthesis, sucrose synthase activity per wheat endosperm remained constant with respect to time in all grains. However, kernels which had higher rates of <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> and which achieved greatest maximum weight had consistently and significantly higher sucrose synthase activities at any point in time than did kernels with slower rates of dry matter accumulation and lower maximum weight. In addition, larger kernels had a significantly greater amount of water in which this activity could be expressed.

40|$|A {{new theory}} of spark {{ignition}} has been formulated which includes {{for the first}} time the temporal dependence of the spark energy input. This theory was based on the observation made here that for ignition the spark kernel or hot bubble of gas created by the spark must grow to a critical size before its expansion velocity falls below a critical value. A model of spark <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> was developed which related the time varying energy input to the kernel expansion in the high pressure region behind a strong shock wave or in an ambient pressure environment behind a weak shock. The strong shock <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> model was developed from a simulation of a time dependent energy release in an ideal gas without transport effects which was modified to reflect real gas behavior. The assumptions that energy loses from the spark kernel due to conduction, radiation or convection were negligible were justified by existing experimental data and observations of spark ignition. ^ Comparisons of observed spark <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> patterns and ignition energies with prediction made using this theory showed very good agreement for a wide range of pressures, air-fuel ratios and spark durations for both stagnant and flowing gases. The increase in ignition energy and decrease in critical spark duration for flowing gases compared to stagnant mixtures were shown to be due to a distortion of the arc by the flow which makes some of the arc energy unavailable for ignition. The use of turbulent critical radii overpredicted the turbulent ignition energies suggesting that even in turbulent flow the critical kernel size is the same as in laminar flow or stagnant cases. ...|$|E

Zinc nutrition affects membrane integrity and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes which are also important to a plant’s {{ability to cope with}} high temperatures. Two experiments were conducted to examine the interaction between Zn nutrition and heat stress at two growth stages. Wheat was grown at deficient and adequate levels of Zn at 22 / 16 °C before being exposed to a short period of high temperature (40 / 20 °C). One experiment examined the response to a 3 day heat stress treatment at 10 days after anthesis and the second experiment examined the response to 6 days of heat stress in 30 -day old seedlings. Varieties differing in thermotolerance and sensitivity to Zn deficiency were compared. Zinc deficiency and heat stress reduced <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> rates, kernel weight and grain yield and the greatest reductions were measured in Zn-deficient, heat stressed plants. The greater reduction in <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> rates from heat stress in Zn deficient plants occurred in both thermotolerant and sensitive varieties and was negatively associated with grain Zn concentration. Genetic differences in tolerance to Zn deficiency did not have consistent effects on the response to heat stress. Chlorophyll fluorescence and chlorophyll content were reduced and chloroplast ultrastructure was disrupted by heat stress and the effect was exacerbated by low supplies of Zn. While the responses to heat stress and low Zn were largely additive effects, the experiments demonstrated that low levels of Zn nutrition can exacerbate the adverse effects of short periods of heat stress on <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> and chloroplast function.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{of the effects of}} spark power and of incomplete fuel-air mixing on spark-ignited flame <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> was conducted in turbulent propane-air mixtures at 1 atm, 300 K conditions. The results showed that increased spark power resulted in an increased growth rate, where the effect of short duration breakdown sparks was found to persist for times of the order of milliseconds. The effectiveness of increased spark power was found to be less at high turbulence and high dilution conditions. Increased spark power had a greater effect on the 0 - 5 mm burn time than on the 5 - 13 mm burn time, {{in part because of the}} effect of breakdown energy on the initial size of the flame kernel. And finally, when spark power was increased by shortening the spark duration while keeping the effective energy the same there was a significant increase in the misfire rate, however when the spark power was further increased by increasing the breakdown energy the misfire rate dropped to zero. The results also showed that fluctuations in local mixture strength due to incomplete fuel-air mixing cause the flame kernel surface to become wrinkled and distorted; and that the amount of wrinkling increases as the degree of incomplete fuel-air mixing increases. Incomplete fuel-air mixing was also found to result in a significant increase in cyclic variations in the flame <b>kernel</b> <b>growth.</b> The average flame <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> rates for the premixed and the incompletely mixed cases were found to be within the experimental uncertainty except for the 33 %-RMS-fluctuation case where the growth rate was significantly lower.

40|$|According to {{conventional}} wisdom, {{a positive relationship}} exists between governance and growth. This paper reexamines this empirical relationship using nonparametric methods. We use different governance measures, as defined in World Governance Indicators provided by the World Bank. The findings show that {{only three of the}} six measures: voice and accountability, political stability, and rule of law are significantly correlated with economic growth. Regulatory control, control of corruption, and government effectiveness were found to be insignificant. The concept of growth profile curves are introduced as a visual device to interpret the results of the nonparametric analysis. We find that the empirical relationship between voice and accountability, political stability, and growth are highly nonlinear. These effects demonstrate heterogeneity across indicators, regions, and time. These empirical results are complementary to the literature on growth diagnostics in demonstrating that specific, targeted reforms to improve governance may be a more effective policy lever to encourage economic growth rather than wholesale reform.

The first part of combustion that consists of flame initiation and flame <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> has laminar velocity. For a certain radius of <b>kernel</b> <b>growth,</b> transition to turbulent flame occurs; afterwards, the flame {{can be described as}} turbulent. This paper investigates the relationship between fuel properties and engine operation parameters, their influence on flame velocity and their ability to calculate the time delay from ignition to 50 % mass fraction burned (MFB) that is used for adjusting the spark advance. The GT-Power software is employed to simulate the combustion process of a spark-ignition (SI) engine. The flame speed mean value model is applied to determine the laminar flame speed under different amounts of unburned mixture, temperatures and pressures. The results show that mixture with less than the stoichiometric ratio has the greatest laminar flame speed. At higher temperature, the difference between poor and rich mixture is significant for laminar flame speed. On the other hand, the relationship between turbulence intensity and engine speed is almost linear. The cylinder pattern used to create turbulence during the intake and compression strokes defines the slope between the engine speed and turbulent flame speed. The mean value flame speed model was capable of determining the combustion phasing and predicting spark ignition in advance...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{regulating}} assimilate transport into developing maize (Zea mays L.) kernels {{have been}} difficult to determine because of the structural complexity of basal kernel tissues and the damage that results from tissue dissection. The sensitivity of maize kernels to experimental manipulation is such that substantial maternal tissue is required to support <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> in vitro. Consequently, sugar transport experiments with isolated seed tissues or detached kernels have not unequivocally demonstrated how sugar transport occurs. In the present study, Tassel-seed Tunicate (Ts- 5 Tu) maize kernels were investigated as a model system for introducing test solutions into the pedicel apoplast with minimal wounding. Transpiration in leafy glumes drew 14 C-sugar solutions up the 8 - to 10 -millimeter-long pedicel stalks into the basal endosperm transfer cell region. 14 C from fructose was incorporated into starch for 8 days. Sugar uptake into endosperm and embryo tissue showed specificity and inhibitor sensitivity. In particular, p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate partially inhibited fructose uptake into the endosperm but had no effect on the metabolic conversion of that fructose that entered the endosperm. These results are consistent with active, carrier-mediated sugar transport, but a definitive determination would require more detailed tissue analysis. We propose that further refinement of the incubation solution may allow long-term <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> without cob tissue and thus provide a more precise determination of which maternal factors influence seed development...|$|E
40|$|In maize (Zea mays L.), drought {{during the}} post-pollination stage {{decreases}} <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> and {{often leads to}} grain yield losses. Kernels in the apical region of the ear are more severely affected than basally positioned kernels. We hypothesized that water deficit during early endosperm development might inhibit <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> by decreasing endosperm cell division, and that this response might be mediated by changes in endosperm abscisic acid (ABA) levels. Greenhouse-grown maize, cultivar Pioneer 3925, was subjected to water limitation from 1 to 15 days after pollination (DAP), spanning the period of endosperm cell division and induction of storage product accumulation. Water deficit decreased the number of endosperm nuclei during the treatment period; the most substantial effect was in the apical region of ears. Correspondingly, endosperm fresh weight, starch accumulation and dry mass at maturity were decreased by water limitation. Abscisic acid concentrations in endosperm were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Water deficit increased ABA concentration in apical-region endosperm by four-fold compared to controls. ABA concentrations were also increased in middle and basal regions of the ear, but to a lesser extent. Two key enzymes in the starch synthesis pathway, sucrose synthase and granule-bound ADP-glucose starch synthase, and zein, the major storage protein in maize endosperm, were studied as markers of storage product synthesis. Water deficit did not affect sucrose synthase enzyme activity or RNA transcript abundance relative to total RNA. However, ADP-glucose starch synthase activity and RNA transcript abundance decreased slightly in apical-region endosperm of water-limited plants by 15 DAP, compared with well-watered controls. In contrast to starch, there was no treatment effect on the accumulation of zein, evaluated at either the polypeptide or RNA level. We conclude that under the conditions tested, the establishment of starch and zein synthetic potential in endosperm was only slightly affected by plant water deficit during the early phase of <b>kernel</b> <b>growth,</b> and that capacity for growth and starch accumulation was affected by {{the extent to which}} cell division was inhibited. Based on correlative changes in ABA concentration and cell division we suggest that ABA {{may play a role in}} inhibiting endosperm cell division during water limitation...|$|E

This efficiency improvement hinges on the ability of the engine to detonate fuel/air mixture through deflagration-to-detonation transitions at 60 to 100 times a second. A major breakthrough in reducing the cycle time of a pulse detonation device is {{through the use of a}} Transient Plasma Ignition (TPI) system vice the normal Capacitive Discharge Ignition (CDI) system. The TPI system deposits an equivalent amount of energy as the CDI system but in a fraction of the time and over a larger combustor volume.

Maize was sown on eight sowing dates (SD) at 15 – 20 -day intervals from mid-March to mid-July during 2012 and 2013 in the North China Plain. With sowing date delay, KW increased initially and later declined, and the greatest KW was obtained at SD 6 in both years. The increased KW at SD 6 was attributed mainly to <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> rate (Gmean), and effective grain-filling period (P). Variations in temperature and radiation were the primary factors that influenced KW and grain-filling parameters. When the effective cumulative temperature (AT) and radiation (Ra) during grain filling were 950 °C and 1005. 4 MJm− 2, respectively, P and KW were greatest. High temperatures (daily maximum temperature [Tmax]> 30. 2 °C) during grain filling under early sowing conditions, or low temperatures (daily minimum temperature [Tmin] 7. 1 °C) decreased <b>kernel</b> <b>growth</b> rate and ultimately final KW.

Earshoots were sampled at 2, 8, 14, and 18 d after silking; dissected into cob, spikelet, and/or pedicel and kernel fractions; then analyzed for amino acid profiles and key enzyme activities associated with amino acid metabolism. Major amino acids in the cob were glutamine (Gln), aspartic acid (Asp), asparagine (Asn), glutamate, and alanine. Gln concentrations dropped dramatically from 2 to 14 d after silking in both pollinated and unpollinated cobs, whereas all other measured amino acids accumulated over time in unpollinated spikelets and cobs, especially Asn. N supply had a variable effect on individual amino acid levels in young cobs and spikelets, with Asn being the most notably enhanced.

Our approach reveals an intrinsic citation rate that clearly separates into an [...] in the long run, exponentially time-dependent [...] ageing function and a completely time-independent preferential-attachment-type <b>growth</b> <b>kernel.</b> For the general case of such a separable citation rate, we obtain the time-dependent citation distribution analytically {{in a form that}} is valid for any functional form of its ageing and growth parts. Good agreement between theory and long-time characteristics of patent-citation data establishes our work as a useful framework for addressing still open questions about knowledge-propagation dynamics, such as the observed excess of citations at short times.

40|$|There are ten {{chapters}} in this dissertation, {{which focuses on}} nine contents: growth estimates for a class of subharmonic functions in the half plane; growth estimates for a class of subharmonic functions in the half space; a generalization of harmonic majorants; properties of limit for Poisson integral; a lower bound for a class of harmonic functions in the half space; the Carleman formula of subharmonic functions in the half space; a generalization of the Nevanlinna formula for analytic functions in the right half plane; integral representations of harmonic functions in the half plane; integral representations of harmonic functions in the half space. The outline of the paper is arranged as follows: Chapter 1 presents the background, basic notations, some basic definitions, lemmas, theorems and propositions of the research; In Chapter 2, we prove that a class of subharmonic functions represented by the modified <b>kernels</b> have the <b>growth</b> estimates at infinity in the upper half plane C+, which generalizes the growth properties of analytic functions and harmoni...|$|R
40|$|We pursue {{applications}} for symplectic Plancherel growth {{based on a}} repulsion phenomenon arising in its diffusion limit and on intermediate representation theory underlying its correlation structure. Under diffusive scaling, the dynamics converge to interlaced reflecting Brownian motions with a wall that achieve Dyson non-colliding dynamics. We exhibit non-degeneracy of constraint in this coupled system by deriving a path property that quantifies repulsion between particles coinciding in the limit. We then identify consistent series of Plancherel measures for Sp(∞) that reflect the odd symplectic groups, despite their non-semisimplicity. As an application, we compute the correlation <b>kernel</b> of the <b>growth</b> model and investigate its local asymptotics: the incomplete beta kernel emerges in the bulk limit, and new variants of the Jacobi and Pearcey kernels arise as edge limits. In particular, we provide further evidence for the universality of the 1 / 4 -growth exponent and Pearcey point process {{in the class of}} anisotropic KPZ with a wall.
