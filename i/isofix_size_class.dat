Recent results show that they also contribute significantly to soil organic matter (SOM) formation. We hypothesized that different molecular <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> of compounds in soil microbial biomass (SMB) have variable turnover time and in consequence influence SOM formation differentially. Here we used natural differences in carbon stable isotope signatures (d 13 C values) after C 3 eC 4 vegetation change to track newly fixed C 4 plant carbon into SMB molecular <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> SMB was obtained by chloroform fumigation extraction (SFE) and d 13 C values of its <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> were measured using size exclusion chromatography coupled online to liquid chromatography‒isotope ratio mass spectrometry (SECeLC eIRMS).

A decreasing carbon turnover of compounds in SMB extracts along a continuum of molecular size from small to large implies that low molecular weight microbial compounds are rapidly metabolized products that link to fast respiratory carbon fluxes, whereas high molecular weight ones could be products of microbial synthesis like structural compounds that have slower turnover rates and link to slower SOM formation. Our methods help avoid contamination of CFE extracts and the results help explain why SMB turnover is faster in CFE extracts when compared to calculations using membrane lipids (e. g.

30|$|Because the {{historical}} timber surveys sampled forest structure during two separate years (1923 and 1936), {{the absence of}} fire in this 16 -year period likely allowed for additional tree recruitment into the smallest <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> in the 1936 dataset (Lydersen et al. 2013). A simple linear model of density conditional on sample year showed a significant increase from 1923 to 1936 (t[*]=[*] 7.6, P[*]<[*] 0.001), but a comparable model of basal area showed {{no significant difference between}} the years (t[*]=[*]− 1.3, P[*]=[*] 0.19).

But the precise mechanisms underlying relationships or how these three ecological properties relate remain elusive. We identify five hypotheses relating energy availability, body size distributions, abundance, and species richness within communities, and we use experimental deep sea wood fall communities to test their predicted effects both on descriptors describing the species richness-body size distribution, and on trends in species richness within <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> over an energy gradient (size class-richness relationships). Invertebrate communities were taxonomically identified, weighed, and counted from 32 Acacia sp. logs ranging in size from 0. 6 to 20. 6 kg (corresponding to different levels of energy available) which were deployed at 3203 m in the Northeast Pacific Ocean for between 5 and 7 years.

Wild-type LPS yielded <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> of 1 X 10 (6) to 4 X 10 (6) daltons, 250, 000 daltons, and 20, 000 daltons. Re LPS yielded <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> of 1 X 10 (6) to 4 X 10 (6) daltons and 20, 000 daltons. Untreated LPS was always greater than 4 X 10 (6) daltons. Chemical characterization of the <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> revealed 3 -keto- 2 -deoxyoctonate in all <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> and suggests that the O-antigenic side chain length may determine the aggregate size in solubilized LPS...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{asks whether}} synergies or {{managerial}} discipline operates {{in different ways}} across small versus large plants to affect the likelihood of mergers. Our findings indicate that those characteristics which provide the type of synergies upon which ownership changes rely are important factors leading to plant-ownership changes across most <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> The magnitudes, however, are different across plant-size classes, with synergies generally being more important in larger plants. Foreign plants in all <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> {{are more likely to}} be taken over. The effective rates of control change differ much more in the small than in the larger <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> Compared to domestic plants, multinational plants in the smaller <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> contain relatively more of the type of intangible capital that makes them attractive vehicles for the transmission of new knowledge via takeover.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2001 Flathead sole, Pacific halibut, rock sole, and {{yellowfin sole}} were found co-existing near Kodiak Island as juveniles (< 200 mm) during late summer. Dietary {{differences}} {{were attributed to}} fish species, size, and depth-sediment characteristics of their habitat. Two to three <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> were assigned within each species. Across all habitats, significant differences in dietary composition, stomach fullness, and diet diversity were found between <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> of different flatfish species. Within a single depth-sediment habitat, flatfishes of different species and <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> ate similar prey. Seven of nine species <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> had similar prey composition across multiple habitats. Significant differences in dietary composition across habitats were detected only for small Pacific halibut and small rock sole. The juvenile flatfishes near Kodiak were opportunistic feeders, and appeared to select habitat based on parameters other than the presence of specific prey taxa...|$|R
40|$|The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) {{program of}} the Bureau of Labor Statistics {{recently}} produced firm size estimates for research purposes. For each of the 3 firm <b>size</b> <b>classes,</b> data series were produced at the total private level for job openings, hires, total separations, quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations from December 2000 through December 2011. For this paper, firm <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> are compared to each other, to national level JOLTS data, Business Employment Dynamics net employment growth, and to Current Employment Statistics by firm size. Differences in {{the movements of the}} time series before, during, and after the most recent recession are analyzed with respect to size of firm. The impact of the economic cycle on larger versus smaller firms is discussed as are other factors that potentially contribute to the time series behavior of the different <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> Key Words: firm <b>size</b> <b>class,</b> research data, recessio...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} distribution of aggregate {{size of the}} diffuse and florid-type prion protein (PrP) plaques was studied in various brain regions in cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). The size distributions were unimodal and positively skewed and resembled those of β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome (DS). The {{frequency distribution}}s of the PrP aggregates were log-normal in shape, but there were deviations from the expected number of plaques in specific <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> More diffuse plaques were observed in the modal <b>size</b> <b>class</b> and fewer in the larger <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> than expected and more florid plaques {{were present in the}} larger <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> compared with the log-normal model. It was concluded that the growth of the PrP aggregates in vCJD does not strictly follow a log-normal model, diffuse plaques growing to within a more restricted size range and florid plaques to larger sizes than predicted. © Springer-Verlag 2005...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{demographics}} of the genus Acacia in Africa, despite its prominence and the economic and environmental importance of this group. The demographics and species composition of stands of four different Acacia species was investigated in the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve in northern Kwazulu-Natal in order to determine whether stands were self-replacing, or whether other Acacia species were invading them. Soil and stand density as well as the density and composition of the grass layer were investigated in order to determine whether any of these affected Acacia demography and species composition. In three out of four cases, the species whose large <b>size</b> <b>class</b> dominated the stand (known as the "stand species") was found to have a strongly bimodal <b>size</b> <b>class</b> distribution, skewed primarily towards the large <b>size</b> <b>class</b> and secondarily towards the small <b>size</b> <b>class.</b> Other Acacia species in the stands, with few or no large individuals present ("nonstand species") tended to have unimodal <b>size</b> <b>class</b> distributions, skewed primarily towards the small <b>size</b> <b>class</b> and secondarily towards the medium <b>size</b> <b>class.</b> Based on the proportion of small to large individuals, non-stand species are more likely to increase in overall numbers in future, suggesting that the species composition of the stands may be in a state of flux. Few relationships were found between stand density, grass density, grass composition and numbers of small and medium acacias. This could be as a result of differentiation between Acacia species, meaning that they cannot be analysed collectively. Furthermore, sample sizes of individual species may have been too small to analyse individually. Alternatively, it could mean that none of these factors {{have a significant effect on}} one another and that other explanations need to be found for the demographics of this genus...|$|R
