40|$|In {{this thesis}} we tackle {{the problem of}} goal-oriented {{adaptation}} of a robot hitting motion. We propose the parameters that must be learned {{in order to use}} and adapt a basic hitting motion to play minigolf. Then, two different statistical methods are used to learn these parameters. The two methods are evaluated and compared. To validate the proposed approach, a minigolf control module is developed for a robotic arm. Using the different learning techniques, we show that a robot can learn the non-trivial task of deciding how the ball should be hit for a given position on a minigolf field. The result is a robust minigolf-playing system that outperforms most human players using only a small set of training examples.

5000|$|Some {{contemporary}} critics interpreted {{these films}} as commentaries and satires {{on the state}} of film-making in Japan at the time. Hasebe denied such intentions on his part, but did not {{rule out the possibility that}} producer Ito and the script-writer may have had this in mind. Hasebe rejected the idea that cinematic violence incites violence in the audience, saying, [...] "I believe violence has no effect on an audience. Personally, I can attest to this fact. I do not become aggressive when I watch a violent movie. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> such a correlation... When I was very young, we admired Humphrey Bogart for his dandyism, but not for his killing. We did not accept the formula. We knew that killing somebody wouldn't make us become him. Why?

Especially the almost orbicular leaves, the thick, short, never curved tendrils, which are inserted far from the apex, the peculiar-shaped pitcher without wings and the strongly vaulted lid are very remarkable. A leaf form as aberrant as this, only occurs in the Philippine species N. truncata. It is not known, in what manner N. clipeata grows. The following seems probable to me. The plant does not climb. The short and robust stems, petioles and tendrils prove, that the mentioned specimens are found in an open place. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>imagine,</b> in what manner the pitchers have been placed when the leaves were spread horizontally. Therefore I suggest, that the plant has grown against the perpendicular wall of the G. Kelam, and that the leaves stood vertically, the pitchers behind it. It is, however, improbable, that N. clipeata can grow only against perpendicular walls, but it is not clear, what may be the manner of growing in other habitats." ...|$|E
5000|$|Channing was {{important}} to the Anthony family. Mary Anthony said [...] "The liberal preaching of William Henry Channing in 1852 proved so satisfactory {{that it was not}} long before this was our accepted church home." [...] Susan B. Anthony's sense of spirituality was influenced by Channing. Her friend and co-worker Elizabeth Cady Stanton said in 1898, [...] "She first found words to express her convictions in listening to Rev. William Henry Channing, whose teaching had a lasting spiritual influence upon her. To-day Miss Anthony is an agnostic. As {{to the nature of the}} Godhead and of the life beyond her horizon she does not profess to know anything. Every energy of her soul is centered upon the needs of this world. To her, work is worship ... Her belief is not orthodox, but it is religious."
