6000|$|To speak precisely, {{those were}} seven lugubrious hours; since Flora {{would not be}} due before eight o'clock, if, indeed, I might count on her eluding her <b>double</b> <b>cordon</b> of spies. The {{question}} was, whither to turn in the meantime? Certainly not back to the town. In the near neighbourhood I knew of no roof but [...] "The Hunters' Tryst," [...] by Alexander Hendry. Suppose that I found it (and the chances in that fog were perhaps against me), would Alexander Hendry; aroused from his bed, be likely to extend his hospitality to a traveller with no more luggage than a Paisley shawl? He might think I had stolen it. I had borne it down the staircase under {{the eyes of the}} runners, and the pattern was bitten upon my brain. It was doubtless unique in the district and familiar: an oriflamme of battle over the barter of dairy produce and malt liquors. Alexander Hendry must recognise it, and with an instinct of antagonism. Patently it formed no part of my proper wardrobe: hardly could it be explained as a gage d'amour. Eccentric hunters trysted under Hendry's roof; the Six-Foot Club, for instance. But a hunter in a frilled shirt and waistcoat sprigged with forget-me-nots! And the house would be watched, perhaps. Every house around would be watched.|$|E

40|$|A second-best {{traffic demand}} {{management}} policy, cordon tolls, is considered. <b>Double</b> <b>cordons</b> are simulated for seven English towns. It is {{found that a}} second, outer cordon implemented jointly with an inner cordon surrounding the city center enhances the increase in social welfare in comparison with a single inner cordon. Although other social and political considerations such as potential revenues and distributional effects may persuade policy makers to implement higher or lower charges, a method is proposed for deciding on the optimal combination of tolls, which {{is defined as the}} combination that maximizes the increase in social welfare for a given cordon location, social welfare being equal to the sum of individual utilities minus the sum of individual costs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the impact of}} road user charging (RUC) on vehicle emissions through application of traffic assignment and pollutant emission models. It presents results of an analysis of five RUC schemes on vehicle emissions in Leeds, UK for 2005. The schemes were: a £ 3 inner ring road cordon charge; a <b>double</b> <b>cordon</b> with a £ 2 inner ring road and a £ 1 outer ring road charge; and distance charges of 2, 10 and 20 pence per km levied for travel within the outer cordon. Schemes were compared to a no charge option and results presented here. Emissions are significantly reduced within the inner cordon, whilst beyond the cordon, localised increases and decreases occur. The <b>double</b> <b>cordon</b> exhibits a similar but less marked pattern. Distance charging reduces city-wide emissions by 10 % under a 2 p/km charge, 42 - 49 % under a 10 p/km charge and 52 - 59 % under a 20 p/km charge. The higher distance charges reduce emissions within the charge zone, and are also associated with elevated emissions outside the zone, but {{to a lesser extent}} than that observed for cordon charging...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} {{the influence of the}} vine training system in the composition in terpenes, norisoprenoids and their precursors (carotenoids and glycosidic molecules), these compounds were quantified in grapes and Port wines belonging to two varieties: Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca from Douro Region. The <b>double</b> <b>cordon</b> LYS 2 / 3 system was compared with the traditional method, the vertical shoot positioning VSP system. Touriga Nacional grapes and wines have higher contents in carotenoids, free and glycosylated fractions of terpenic and norisoprenoids compounds than Touriga Franca. In general, LYS 2 / 3 training system produced grapes and wines with high content in glycosylated fractions of terpenes and nor-isoprenoids, being more appropriate to the production of Port wines, which are submitted to an aging process...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} long-term economic effects of three cordon-based road pricing schemes applied to the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. To conduct this analysis, we employ a spatially disaggregated general equilibrium model of a regional economy that incorporates the decisions of residents, firms, and developers, integrated with a spatially disaggregated strategic transportation planning model that features mode, time period, and route choice. We find that all cordon pricing schemes increase welfare of the residents, as well as lead to GDP growth. At the optimum, the larger cordon and a <b>double</b> <b>cordon</b> lead to higher benefits than the small cordon encompassing downtown core. Nevertheless, the small cordon {{seems to be a}} safer bet because when the toll charge is set suboptimally, the net benefits from the small cordon compared to the optimum change negligibly, while the net benefits from the larger cordon decline sharply as the charge deviates from the optimal level. traffic congestion, cordon tolls, land use, welfare analysis, road pricing, general equilibrium, simulation, Washington DC...|$|E
50|$|Pruning {{of vines}} {{should take place}} annually, before the first leaves have fully developed.

Once suckering and green harvesting have been completed, the maximum number of clusters allowed per vine is 14.|$|R
50|$|Inside the station, {{the left-wing}} activist José Júlio da Costa {{was waiting for}} him, concealing a pistol in his Alentejo cloak. When the President passed the assassin {{on the first floor}} of Rossio station, Da Costa {{penetrated}} the <b>double</b> police <b>cordon</b> that surrounded the President and fired two shots from the pistol hidden under his cloak. The first shot hit Pais in the right arm, where the bullet became lodged. The second shot hit the President in the stomach, causing a wound which would prove fatal. Pais immediately fell to the ground, and a panic broke out. During the confusion, four innocent bystanders were fatally wounded by the guards; the assassin, who didn't try to escape, was arrested after being brutally beaten by the crowd. Pais was still alive at this point and was rushed to St. Joseph hospital, but he died of his wounds en route to the hospital shortly before midnight.|$|R
2500|$|Within these larger classifications, {{the vine}} {{training}} {{system may be}} further distinguished by the canopy such as whether it is free (like goblet) or constrained by shoot positioning along wires (such as VSP trellising) and whether it includes a single curtain (Guyot) or <b>double</b> (Lyre). For <b>cordon</b> and many other spur trained systems, they {{could be described as}} unilateral (utilizing only 1 arm or cordon) or bilateral with both arms extending from the trunk. Two other classifications, based on trellising, are whether or not the vine is [...] "staked" [...] with an external support structure and the number of wires used in the trellising. Vines may be individual staked either permanently, as many vineyards along the bank of the Rhone Valley which are at risk of wind damage, or temporarily as some young vines are to provide extra support. Within a trellis system fruiting canes and young shoots are attached to wires strung out across the rows. The number of wires used (one, two, three) {{and whether or not they}} are movable (such as the Scott Henry) will influence the size of the canopy and the yield.|$|R
30|$|An {{interesting}} point to note {{is the current}} height of the <b>double</b> <b>cordon</b> fence. The inner fence {{on the western side}} (Botswana) is stock proof at 1.4  m high, while the one on the eastern side (Zimbabwe) is stock and game proof at 2.4  m. However, in areas like Matopi, both fences are at a height of 1.4  m (presumably for ease of maintenance following relentless pressure by elephants). In an earlier study by Hargreaves et al. (2004) in Zimbabwe on the outbreak of FMD in cattle adjacent to a conservancy, epidemiological investigations showed that it was most likely that antelope (impala or kudu) infected through contact with the buffalo herd within the conservancy had jumped over the fence and transmitted the virus to nearby cattle herds. Following this incident, the height of fencing surrounding conservancies in Zimbabwe was increased to a minimum of 2.3  m (Hargreaves et al. 2004), which may prompt reconsideration on the sufficiency of the current cordon fence height. In fact, a small number of respondents in the current study did mention the non-kudu-proof fence as a possible constraint in combating the disease.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{environmental}} benefits and changes in social surplus from second best congestion tolls in eight English towns are estimated and compared with those from second best environmental tolls. Single and <b>double</b> <b>cordon</b> tolls are simulated using the SATURN model (Simulation and Assignment of Traffic to Urban Road Networks), with associated software to simulate the changes in traffic patterns resulting from cordon tolls. With these results the second best environmental and congestion tolls are computed. Changes in vehicle emissions are estimated and reduction in health and global warming costs computed. It is found that whereas any toll designed to reduce traffic congestion would yield positive environmental benefits not any toll designed to reduce environmental costs would yield positive benefits in social surplus. Double cordons yield higher absolute benefits than single ones, but the ratio of environmental benefits to other transport benefits stays roughly constant and is quite small. It is concluded that altogether more efficient results may be obtained by introducing a congestion toll than by introducing an environmental one.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In Europe, many {{autochthonous}} grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) {{are only}} cultivated at local scale, but {{play a very}} important economic role due to their strict relation with terroir and wine tipicity. In this study, it was pursued to evaluate the influence of several factors on performance of Moll, the main autochthonous white variety of Majorca, {{by means of the}} data-base coming from a clonal preselection. The effects of multiple virus infections, vintage and vineyard components were studied by univariate linear models and principal component analy-sis, starting from measurement of production and must quality parameters of several vines located in 14 vineyards belonging to two appellations during four consecutive years (2001 - 2004). Absence of multiple virus infections, <b>double</b> <b>cordon</b> system, high clay content and Useful Water Reserve in soils have enhanced vine production without inducing considerable alterations in sugar accumulation in berries and acidity. Moll variety presented great viticultural and oenological potentials. Fertile and deep soils should be preferred in order to maximize production. Also, the use of certified propagation material is strongly recommended. However, further investigations are required to optimize must quality by opportune managements. This study does not provide only essential information to improve Moll cultivation in Majorca, but it also represents a useful example to analyze grapevine varieties that are endemically infected by viruses. In fact, in such situations, it may be supposed an insidious interference by viruses on terroir and wine tipicity...|$|E
40|$|More than 70 % of the {{vineyards}} of Douro, the Port wine region, are planted in hillsides with a slope superior to 30 %. After the inscription of the Douro Valley in the "World Heritage list - UNESCO", in slopes higher than 30 % is mandatory that vineyards are planted in terraces {{with less than}} 2. 5 m wide and a single row of plantation. However narrow terraces have the disadvantage of a low planting density and consequently a low yield potential, circumstance the disencourages its use by grape growers. Because of that, an experiment was performed in a vineyard planted in terraces of 2. 3 m wide, and a single row of vines, with two alternatives of training. 1) the traditional vertical shoot positioning - VSP and 2) a <b>double</b> <b>cordon,</b> trained upwards and downwards, the LYS 2 / 3. Additionally, two pruning alternatives had been introduced in the cordon trained downwards of LYS 2 / 3, spur pruning (Royat) and can pruning. The variety used was Touriga Nacional, grafted in 110 R. The results obtained in 2005 and 2006 showed that yield in the LYS 2 / 3 system was 24 % {{higher than in the}} VSP. Regarding the quality parameters, both training systems reached good fruit sugar concentrations, 14. 0 for VSP and 12. 8 % v/v for LYS 2 / 3. As conclusion, Touriga Nacional, revealed high quality potential and narrow terraces proved {{to be a very good}} alternative in planting hillside vineyards, being LYS 2 / 3 a system able to reach an important improvement in yield, and even if with a lower sugar content, allowing to achieve a satisfactory quality...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{nutritional}} diagnosis requires {{specific reference}} levels for each grape variety to effectively reflect the nutritional {{status of the}} crop. A vine nutritional survey was undertaken in the Rioja A. O. C., northeastern Spain. The survey method was used to establish the preliminary norms {{in the application of}} the Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) to the nutritional diagnosis of leaf blade and petiole tissues of Vitis vinifera L., cv. Tempranillo, on Richter- 110 rootstock. These DRIS norms were generated from data obtained during the course of 11 years (2000 ¿ 10) from 166 vineyards trained on both Gobelet and Vertical Shoot Position (VSP) pruned Guyot and <b>Double</b> <b>Cordon</b> Royat systems. The database obtained includes information from different altitudes, soil types, cultural practices, and climatic conditions within the Rioja appellation. The majority of the vineyards had no irrigation and soil was tilled mechanically. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium were analyzed in leaf blade and petiole dry tissues sampled at both flowering and veraison. Vineyards with phytosanitary damages or flowering problems were discarded. Ratios among nutrients were established for the blade and petiole at both flowering and veraison by comparing two subpopulations of high and low quality. Both subpopulations were selected from a limited production criteria by a Student¿s t-test mean comparison. Finally, DRIS norms for leaf blade and petiole at both flowering and veraison are proposed for the nutrition diagnosis of the cv. Tempranillo in the Rioja A. O. C.

Data were statistically analyzed to obtain the normal average values considering the (¿ ± 0. 25 ¿) of the central data as optimal levels and the tails values (¿ ± 0. 84 ¿) of the population as excessive or deficient levels. The statistical procedure included the Kolmogorov¿Smirnov nonparametric test for normality, data transformations for normality, and the calculation of percentiles when those transformations to normal distributions become unlikely (P 20, P 40, P 60, and P 80).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{relationship}} between carotenoid contents in grapevine berries and plant water status. For this purpose, a black grapevine variety, Vitis vinifera L. cv. Touriga Nacional, was studied. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} same Douro vineyards, with plants of the same age, in two different water retention soils. A higher water retention capacity soil, soil A, and a lower water retention capacity soil, soil B, were both in a 1. 2 m deep silt-loam schist-derived soil. The training system was the <b>double</b> <b>cordon</b> trained and spur pruned. A first range was nonirrigated (NI) and a second one was irrigated (I), 60 % of evapotranspiration (ET 0). For soil B, a 30 % of ET 0 treatment was also applied. The plant water status was estimated by predawn leaf water potential. The effects of plant water status on berry growth were studied by measurement of the berry weight and total soluble solids (°Brix). The carotenoid profile was quantitatively determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/diode array. Carotenoids determined were â-carotene, lutein, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, and luteoxanthin. The comparison between irrigated and nonirrigated grapes was followed from 2 weeks before veraison until the ripe stage. Results showed that at harvest time, berries exposed to the NI had a lower weight than those exposed to the irrigated treatment (60 % of ET 0), 0. 89 vs 1. 36 g/berry and 0. 94 vs 1. 34 g/berry, for soils A and B, respectively. The irrigated treatment contributed to a higher sugar concentration in both soils. However, depending on the soil water retention capacity, the carotenoid contents were different in soils A and B. For soil A, the total carotenoid content was similar for both NI and I treatments. However, with regard to soil B, in irrigated treatment, levels of carotenoids were approximately 60 % lower than those found for the NI. It seems to be possible to produce higher weight berries (with higher sugar levels) with similar carotenoid contents. On the other hand, soil characteristics had a larger influence than irrigation on the concentration of carotenoids in grapes, resulting in an important viticultural parameter to take into account in aroma precursor formation...|$|E
