25|$|It was the 21st Spanish Grand Prix {{since the}} race was first held in 1913. It was the fourth, and last, Grand Prix to be held on the Montjuïc street circuit. The race was {{shortened}} to 29 of its scheduled 75 laps, a race distance of 109 kilometres. The race was won by German driver Jochen Mass driving a McLaren M23. It {{would be the only}} Formula One win of his career. Mass had <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> lead over the Lotus 72E of Belgian driver Jacky Ickx when {{the race was}} declared. Argentine racer Carlos Reutemann was declared third in his Brabham BT44B, a lap behind the race leaders after a penalty was given to Jean-Pierre Jarier. This was the final win by a German driver until Michael Schumacher won the 1992 Belgian Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco {{started the}} second half with a drive into Washington territory, aided by a {{controversial}} ruling in which running back Wendell Tyler dropped the ball <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> after catching it and then dove on it. Officials ruled the play a fumble and recovery for the 49ers rather than an incompletion. But kicker Ray Wersching later slipped on the muddy field while attempting a 50-yard field goal and it fell well short. On Washington's next drive, they ran another trick play, this time a pass from Riggins, who threw a 36-yard completion to Charlie Brown inside the 49ers 15-yard line. But all that led to was Moseley's third missed field goal attempt of the day, this one from 38 yards, that he once again sent wide right.|$|E
25|$|Weidlinger {{started his}} career as a {{specialist}} in the 3000 metres steeplechase and he just missed out on a medal at the 1996 World Junior Championships in Athletics, finishing fourth in the final. He won his first championship medal the following year, by winning the steeplechase race at the 1997 European Athletics Junior Championships. He began representing Austria in cross country running competitions and after winning a silver medal in the junior race at the 1997 European Cross Country Championships, he stepped up to the senior ranks for the 1998 edition and was fourth, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> behind Driss El Himer. After winning the gold medal at the 1999 European Athletics U23 Championships, he attended his first global senior championships – the 1999 World Championships in Athletics. He reached the steeplechase final and finished in ninth position with a national record time of 8:10.83. He improved upon this the following year by taking eighth place in the same event at the 2000 Summer Olympics.|$|E

25|$|Dempsey {{was not in}} the {{starting}} XI for the first three matches of the 2007–08 season, but after an injury to Brian McBride, he came into the side as a striker and scored in a 2–1 defeat against Aston Villa. He followed this up by scoring in Fulham's next fixture in a 3–3 home draw against Tottenham on September 1. Two weeks later, he opened the scoring in Fulham's 1–1 away draw against Wigan Athletic. These goals gave Dempsey three in as many games. On September 29, Dempsey was involved in an aerial collision with John Terry during a 0–0 draw at Stamford Bridge which resulted in Terry later being substituted. There was some suggestion that Dempsey used a deliberate elbow on Terry; however, he wasn't punished for the incident as referee Martin Atkinson didn't report it to The Football Association (The FA). On November 3, Dempsey scored during Fulham's 3–1 home win over Reading to secure <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> league win of the season. He scored his last goals of the season in a 1–1 home draw with Wigan Athletic and a 5–1 away loss to Tottenham in December. In May 2008, Fulham announced Dempsey had signed a contract extension which would keep him at the club until the summer of 2010. Fulham beat Portsmouth 1–0 {{on the final day of}} the season to secure Premier League status for another year. He ended the season as Fulham's top Premier League goalscorer with six goals.|$|E
500|$|Writing in {{the late}} 1970s, Nicholas Schaffner noted the song's [...] "towering simplicity" [...] and the [...] "endlessly {{repetitive}} fade-out that somehow manages to be hypnotic instead of boring". Like Leng and Schaffner, a number of commentators have remarked on the significance of [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] {{in the context of}} the Beatles' demise, starting with the song's length: 7:10 – <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> under [...] "Hey Jude". Ben Gerson, in his 1971 Rolling Stone review, described the song as a [...] "lament... whose beginning is the broken thirds of John's 'I Am the Walrus' and whose end is the decadent, exultant last half of Paul's 'Hey Jude'". Peter Doggett considers [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] a [...] "remarkably non-judgemental commentary on the disintegration of the Beatles' spirit".|$|E
500|$|Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station. [...] Rating higher, Cambridge took an early lead under the {{guidance}} of experienced stroke Adam Wright, and were almost a length up after two-and-a-half minutes. [...] By the Mile Post, the lead was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> and the long bend around Harrods Furniture Depository, afforded Oxford the advantage, and by Hammersmith Bridge the Dark Blues were over two seconds ahead. Extending their lead to seven seconds by Chiswick Steps, Oxford took control of the race and passed under Barnes Bridge with a twelve-second advantage. [...] Oxford passed the finishing post in a time of 16 minutes 59 seconds, the third-fastest {{time in the history of}} the Boat Race, winning their 18th race in 23 years. [...] The Beefeater Gin Trophy was presented to the victorious Oxford Boat Club president Obholzer by the Princess Royal.|$|E

2500|$|Graham Kennedy's News Show was {{a rarity}} {{in that it was}} a live news show that had a studio audience.

2500|$|One of {{the more}} famous images of the event was the live {{broadcast}} of Hoy Mismo, a news program in the Televisa television network, when the earthquake struck. In the video, movement can be seen, especially in the lights above the newscasters. The three newscasters were María Victoria Llamas (substituting for Guillermo Ochoa), Lourdes Guerrero and Juan Dosal. As the movement began Llamas reports grabbing {{the underside of the}} desk, and whispering quickly to her colleagues that she hoped no one could see how scared she was. The last image broadcast from the studio was that of Lourdes Guerrero stating [...] "...it's still shaking a little (sigue temblando un poquitito), but we must take it calmly. We will wait <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> so we can keep talking." [...] Then the image disappeared. The transmission ended because a nearby 10-ton antenna had bent over and crushed parts of Televisa's buildings that were located on Niños Héroes and Dr. Río de la Loza Streets in Colonia Doctores.|$|E
