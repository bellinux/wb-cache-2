5000|$|The Madballs {{are on a}} bumpy ride {{on their}} ship through space. On the {{on-board}} television, the Madballs are delighted {{by what they see}} to be rock and roll music on Earth, with a band called The Cartoons about to perform, being introduced by their manager, Skip. The Madballs then decide to go on to Earth. Meanwhile, on <b>Earth,</b> <b>Skip</b> is desperate because the Cartoons have not yet been able to make it to their concert. His sister, Sandy, receives a phone call in which she is informed that the Cartoons are in Alaska and are not returning. Back in space, the Madballs are looking forward to heading to Earth, until they realize that Wolfbreath and the Badballs have left in a spaceship of their own and are going after the Madballs, and he threatens the Madballs with a broadcast warning. Wolfbreath orders the firing of lasers to go after the Madballs' comparatively rickety spaceship as they go through an asteroid belt. The Madballs survive the belt and eventually land on Earth {{at the site of the}} concert. They sing a cover of [...] "Great Balls of Fire" [...] by Jerry Lee Lewis to an enthusiastic crowd. However, Wolfbreath's spaceship lands on Earth, and after the Madballs give their performance, he and his Badballs order the Madballs to return to Orb. An angry Freakella, offended by being called [...] "Mophead", leads an attack on the Badballs, forcing them back into their spaceship and sending them back to Orb. The crowd cheers yet again. The special ends with Skip agreeing to be the Madballs' manager.|$|E

When these nets are simulated, mobility models {{can be used to}} specify node movements. The work in this thesis focuses on designing an extension of the random trip mobility model on a city section from EPFL (Swiss federal institute of technology). Road data is extracted from the census TIGER database, displayed in Google Earth and used as input for the model. This model produces output {{that can be used in}} the open source network simulator ns- 2. We created utilities that take output from a database of US counties, the TIGER database, and convert it to KML. KML is an XML based format used by Google Earth to store geographical data, so that it can be viewed in Google Earth. This data will then be used as input to the modified mobility model and finally run through the ns- 2 simulator. We present some NAM traces, a network animator that will show node movements over time. We managed to complete most of the goals we set out, apart from being able to modify node positions in Google <b>Earth.</b> This was <b>skipped</b> because the model we modified had an initialization phase that made node positions random regardless of initial position. We were also asked to add the ability to set stationary nodes in Google Earth; this was not added due to time constraints...|$|R
