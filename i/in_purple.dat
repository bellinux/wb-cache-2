5|$|In the 1960s, flocked Christmas trees <b>in</b> <b>purple,</b> gold, pink, {{and even}} black became popular. The trees' {{branches}} were coated in a chemically-created, flame retardant substance resembling snow. Sophisticated style mavens suggested {{developing a new}} Christmas tree theme every year and buying color coordinated ornaments. Natural trees would return to favor in the 1970s when country arts and crafts became popular.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{are often}} used in atomic clocks. Caesium atomic clocks are {{extraordinarily}} accurate; if a clock had been made {{at the time of}} the dinosaurs, it would be off by less than four seconds (after 80 million years). For that reason, caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second. Rubidium ions {{are often used}} <b>in</b> <b>purple</b> fireworks, and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the emblem sits a green outline of Belarus, {{superimposed}} over the rays of a golden sun. The sun is partially covered by a globe, with the landmass (part of Eurasia) <b>in</b> <b>purple</b> and waters in blue. Lining the left and right sides of the emblem are stalks of wheat, superimposed with flowers. Clovers adorn the left wheat stalks; flax flowers adorn the right. Wrapped around the wheat stalks is a red and green ribbon bearing the colours of the flag of Belarus; the ribbon meets {{at the base of the}} emblem, where the name Republic of Belarus (Рэспублiка Беларусь) is inscribed in gold in the Belarusian language. At the top of the emblem there is a five-pointed red star.|$|E

5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both {{stay out of the}} market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked <b>in</b> <b>purple)</b> are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E
5|$|When Maribor was established, some of {{the club}} {{officials}} were favouring the red and white colours, while the traditional colours of Branik were black and white. Because {{of the fact that}} many football teams in Yugoslavia wore red and white or black and white jerseys, most notably Red Star Belgrade and Partizan, Maribor officials decided for a new and fresh combination. They decided to follow the example of Fiorentina, which at the time {{was one of the most}} successful clubs in Europe, and their purple and white combination. Oto Blaznik, the first captain in history of the club, was the one who proposed the combination after seeing the Italian side play. Eventually, they changed the secondary colour to yellow. In July 2015, white replaced yellow as the secondary colour. Today, Maribor play their home matches <b>in</b> <b>purple</b> and away matches in white kits. Since July 2011, the club's kit manufacturer is Adidas.|$|E
25|$|Anthocyanins {{tend to be}} {{the main}} polyphenolics <b>in</b> <b>purple</b> grapes whereas flavan-3-ols (i.e. catechins) are the more {{abundant}} phenolic in white varieties. Total phenolic content, a laboratory index of antioxidant strength, is higher <b>in</b> <b>purple</b> varieties due almost entirely to anthocyanin density <b>in</b> <b>purple</b> grape skin compared to absence of anthocyanins in white grape skin. It is these anthocyanins that are attracting the efforts of scientists to define their properties for human health. Phenolic content of grape skin varies with cultivar, soil composition, climate, geographic origin, and cultivation practices or exposure to diseases, such as fungal infections.|$|E
