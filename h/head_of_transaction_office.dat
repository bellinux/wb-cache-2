40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the process of Austrian “aryanisations”; this paper, however, aims to {{describe}} how “aryanisations” are reflected in the civil judicial decisions of the Regional Court of Vienna (Landgericht Wien) from the Nazi period. For that purpose, 28 court files were analysed, of which 13 resulted in a court ruling. The paper concerns exclusively the “aryanisations” of sole proprietorships and points out the most common difficulties and questions arising from the transfer of “Jewish” assets into “Aryan hands”. This includes, for instance, the uncertain effects of National Socialist provisions in civil court procedures, the intervention <b>of</b> the Property <b>Transactions</b> <b>Office</b> (Vermögensverkehrsstelle) and its impact on the price agreement of the parties, as well as the question of the legal basis of “aryanisations”. It is demonstrated that the economic interests of the National Socialist state were respected by the courts and that its institutions and regulations were taken into account and included in the decision-making practice of the Regional Court of Vienna (Landgericht Wien). The work concludes that – based on the small sample of decisions analysed – there was nevertheless a basic tendency to adhere to the traditional principles of civil law, specifically private autonomy and the sanctity of contracts, in litigations involving “Jewish” and “Aryan” individuals...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} {{intrinsic}} {{energy efficiency rating}} of an office building has {{a significant impact on}} its rental value. A sample <b>of</b> 817 <b>transactions</b> for <b>offices</b> with Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) in the UK is used to assess whether a pricing differential can be identified, depending on the energy rating. While previous analyses of this topic have typically relied on appraisal-based and/or asking rent data, the dataset used in this research contains actual contract rents as well as information on lease terms. The results indicate a significant rental premium for energy-efficient buildings. However, it is found that this premium appears to be mainly driven by the youngest cohort of state-of-the-art energy-efficient buildings. The results also show that tenants of more energy-efficient buildings tend to pay a lower service charge, but this link appears to be rather weak and limited to newer buildings. Hence, it is argued that the information contained in the EPC is still not fully taken into account in the UK commercial property market {{with the possible exception of}} both the highest and the lowest EPC ratings...|$|R

40|$|Valuing {{customers}} is {{a central}} issue for any commercial activity. The customer lifetime value (CLV) is the discounted value of the fu-ture profits that this customer yields to the company. In order to compute the CLV, one needs {{to predict the future}} number of transac-tions a customer will make and the profit <b>of</b> these <b>transactions.</b> With the Pareto/NBD model, the future number <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> <b>of</b> a cus-tomer can be predicted, and the CLV is then computed as a discounted product between this number and the expected profit per transaction.

We show that the dependence between the number <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> and their profitability can be used to increase the accuracy of the predic-tion of the CLV.

40|$|Abstract: Companies {{have been}} {{investing}} in integrated enterprise applications (such as ERP) {{for over a}} decade, without firm evidence of a return from these investments. Much research has centred on the factors which {{will lead to a}} successful implementation project (eg: Holland and Light, 1999; Shanks and Seddon, 2000), but to date there appears to be little research on the longer term impact of ERP systems on the organisation (Heili and Vinck, 2008). Although the greater level of system integration brought on by ERP has meant that there is more operational information available to managers than ever before, the information stored in ERP applications requires much off-line manipulation in order to be meaningful to managers. The data held in ERP databases originate in physical processes that evolve over time, and thus inevitably a gap opens between the ERP system, and the reality it is designed to capture (Lee and Lee, 2000). Taking the evaluation of management performance against organisational objectives as research domain, and focusing on a case study in the pharmaceutical sector, this paper looks at the footprint of a global ERP system in the day to day decision making of managers both at a manufacturing site level and at Headquarters level. Although the ERP implementation resulted in major improvements in data integrity at an operational level, resulting in improved visibility of costs and traceability <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> for <b>head</b> <b>office,</b> many <b>of</b> the benefits associated with exploiting the information thus collected have been compromised by the need to rely on non-integrated tools for certain specific functions.

40|$|Whatever form it may take, {{the peer}} review of manuscripts {{submitted}} to scientific journals always {{has the same}} purpose: to proffer a totally objective opinion. This involves taking {{on the role of}} “modest witness”, that of a man of science unpolluted by his own subjectivity and corporeality, whose historical and political emergence was so well documented by Shapin and Schaffer (1985). In her now famous text, Haraway (1996) reconceptualized this posture by arguing for the elucidation of the material conditions of existence of subjects and objects of knowledge in as much as they are continuously traversed by language, story, corporeality and metaphor. It is in this context that we now examine the forms of arrangement developed between anonymity and objectivity in the evaluation of scientific articles. We will pay particular attention {{to the way in which}} the technologies used to decide upon the fate of manuscripts attribute distinct positions of judgement within the decision-making process. And as this story unfolds, we will see that the commitment of researchers (female scholars in particular) who feel themselves to have been hard done by is far from anecdotal. Peer review was one of several different technologies to emerge during the 17 th century, notably at The Royal Society in London, for the purpose of carrying out experiments, determining the forms of participation by scientists and guaranteeing validation of the facts (Shapin & Schaffer 1985).
