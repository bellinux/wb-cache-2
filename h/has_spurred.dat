The museum had 302,583 visitors in 2009 and 273,108 visitors in 2008. There were approximately 500,000 visitors during its first year (November 2004 â€“ 2005).|$|E
5|$|Academic {{study of}} Barbadian music remains limited. Some song {{collections}} {{and other activities}} have been conducted, but there remain significant holes in scholarship, such as the musics of recent immigrants from China and India, who presumably have brought with them styles of Indian and Chinese musics. Due {{to a lack of}} archaeological and historical records, the island's indigenous music is unknown. Since the 1970s, an increase in general interest in Barbadian culture <b>has</b> <b>spurred</b> greater study of music, and given an incentive to radio and television stations to create and maintain archives of cultural practices.|$|E
5|$|Many, if not all, {{countries}} have {{some degree of}} polyethnicity, with countries like the United States and Canada having large levels and countries like Japan and Poland having very small levels (and more specifically, a sense of homogeneity). The amount of polyethnicity prevalent in some Western countries <b>has</b> <b>spurred</b> some arguments against it, which include a belief that it leads to the weakening of each society's strengths, and also a belief that political-ethnic issues in countries with polyethnic populations are better handled with different laws for certain ethnicities.|$|E

5|$|The Cold War {{was a major}} political, {{economic}} and military endeavor for over four decades, but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically {{by the end of}} Reagan's presidency. The significance of Reagan's role in ending the Cold War <b>has</b> <b>spurred</b> contentious and opinionated debate. That Reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the Soviet Union is agreed, but the extent of this role is continuously debated, with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism, as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|It has {{a smooth}} and bright surface, {{with a layer}} of water {{surrounding}} the mantle of the planet, thought to be 100 kilometers thick. The smooth surface includes a layer of ice, while the bottom of the ice is theorized to be liquid water. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. Heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity. Life may exist in Europa's under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents or the Antarctic Lake Vostok. Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to microbial life on Earth in the deep ocean. So far, {{there is no evidence that}} life exists on Europa, but the likely presence of liquid water <b>has</b> <b>spurred</b> calls to send a probe there.|$|E
5|$|Premiering at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival {{and opening}} in New York City and Los Angeles on May 24, 2006, the {{documentary}} {{was a critical}} and box office success, winning two Academy Awards for Best Documentary Feature and Best Original Song. The film grossed $24 million in the U.S. and $26 million at the international box office, becoming the tenth highest grossing documentary film to date in the United States. Since the film's release, An Inconvenient Truth has been credited for raising international public awareness of global warming and reenergizing the environmental movement. The documentary has also been included in science curricula in schools around the world, which <b>has</b> <b>spurred</b> some controversy. A sequel to the film, titled , was released on July 28, 2017.|$|E

50|$|Some {{tortoises}} in {{the genus}} Testudo also bear spurs, though these {{form on the}} femur rather than the foot. Unlike other spurs, they serve no obvious function. In the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca), {{both males and females}} <b>have</b> <b>spurs.</b> In a related tortoise, Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), neither the male or female <b>have</b> thigh <b>spurs</b> but both <b>have</b> a <b>spur</b> on the tip of the tail which is larger in the male.|$|R
5|$|So far, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that life exists on Europa, but Europa has emerged as one of the most likely locations in the Solar System for potential habitability. Life could exist in its under-ice ocean, perhaps in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents. Even if Europa lacks volcanic hydrothermal activity, a 2016 NASA study found that Earth-like levels of hydrogen and oxygen could be produced through processes related to serpentinization and ice-derived oxidants, which do not directly involve volcanism. In 2015, scientists announced that salt from a subsurface ocean may likely be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. The likely presence of liquid water in contact with Europa's rocky mantle <b>has</b> <b>spurred</b> calls to send a probe there.|$|E
5|$|A westward freeway {{extension}} of MD 177 was under construction from MD 3 (Glen Burnie Bypass) east to MD 2 by 1963. The freeway opened as MD 177 in 1964 with intermediate interchanges at MD 174 and Oakwood Road. In 1966, the freeway was extended slightly east to terminate at Mountain Road at an intersection {{at the site}} of today's ramps to and from westbound MD 100. By 1967, an {{extension of}} the freeway east to beyond Jacobsville was proposed. The eastward freeway extension opened in 1971; however, the extension and the freeway west to MD 3 were designated MD 100. MD 177 was expanded to a divided highway from MD 2 to MD 10 when the latter freeway was extended south from MD 648 to MD 100 between 1987 and 1989. The divided highway was extended east to Lipin's Corner in 1997. Since the late 1970s, heavy traffic on MD 177 east of MD 100 <b>has</b> <b>spurred</b> efforts to build a bypass of the Lake Shore section or widen the highway, projects that have been opposed by residents who fear increased development on the peninsula. Congestion on the highway was eased significantly when lane use signals were added to allow the center lane of the highway to become a travel lane during rush hours in July 1999.|$|E

25|$|The mineral {{industry}} in Peru has also generated controversy. While the {{mineral industry}} <b>has</b> <b>spurred</b> national economic growth, {{it has also}} produced changes to the environment that compromise rural populations' livelihoods.

Best known are the spurs on chicken, though most galliform birds bear spurs. The spurs are mostly found in males, and used in mating competition or territory defence.
