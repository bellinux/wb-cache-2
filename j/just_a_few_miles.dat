Vénus only survived with the co-operation of the British prisoners aboard, who brought the ship safely to port.

5|$|Early {{experiments}} with floating petroleum {{on the sea}} and igniting it were not entirely successful: the fuel was difficult to ignite, large quantities were required to cover even modest areas and the weapon was easily disrupted by waves. However, the potential was clear. By early 1941 a flame barrage technique was developed. Rather than attempting to ignite oil floating on water, nozzles were placed above high-water mark with pumps producing sufficient pressure to spray fuel which produced a roaring wall of flame over, rather than on, the water. Such installations consumed considerable resources and although this weapon was impressive, its network of pipes was vulnerable to pre-landing bombardment; General Brooke did not consider it effective. Initially ambitious plans were cut back to cover <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> of beaches.|$|E

The highway was first designated in 1928 running north out of downtown Jackson. It connected U.S. Highway12 (US12) to the state prison and Bunkerhill Road.

A larger attack of the Swabian League took place on April 11, 1499: the Swabian troops occupied and plundered some villages on the southern shore of Lake Constance, just south of Constance.

Despite the damage his ships had suffered in the heavy weather conditions, Bompart attempted to escape but was swiftly run down and defeated in battle, his flagship and four frigates being captured and towed into Lough Swilly. Among the prisoners seized on board the flagship was Theobald Wolfe Tone, leader of the United Irishmen, whose capture and subsequent death signified the end of the rebellion.

50|$|The {{company began}} in 1867 as the William Butcher Steel Works. The {{products}} that founders William Butcher, Jr. (a {{son of the}} founder of W. & S.

At about this time in nearby Bethlehem, the predecessor company of Bethlehem Steel was also getting into the steel rail business. The Nicetown site was chosen because plenty of the anthracite coal that moved by river, canal, and rail from northeast Pennsylvania passed by Nicetown on its way to Port Richmond. Anthracite was superior to bituminous coal for steelmaking. Nicetown's proximity to one of the principal locomotive-building plants of the western hemisphere, the Baldwin Locomotive Works (which at the time was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> rail-served <b>miles</b> away in the Spring Garden neighborhood), was another benefit of the site.|$|R

50|$|Abundant natural {{resources}} of Central Asia become important factor for South Asia {{which has the}} scantiest endowment of hydrocarbons to fulfill their energy requirements. In this context, Gwadar port can {{play a significant role}} as an energy corridor to link Central and South Asia into economic integration to achieve a sustainable economic growth. Located <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>miles</b> away, the energy corridor will connect the Central Asian states of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan to exploit over 217 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves which are more in quantum than Saudi Arabia’s resources (Aziz, 2005, p. 63). Moreover, South Asia can enable Central Asian States to diversify their economies by supplying gas and oil on global market prices as Russia’s Gasprom, oil and gas company, is exploiting the Central Asian countries’ energy flow on a very minimal price. The Central Asia has old gas pipeline network which known as the Central Asia-Center (CAC) gas pipeline system runs from Turkmenistan through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to Russia. The CAC is a network of five separate pipelines which are being used for transportation of energy from the Central Asia to Russia. These pipelines were started constructing in 1966 and completed in 1987. Keeping in view the rich energy resources of Central Asia, Russia has increased its transit capacity to retain energy from the Central Asia (Fredholm, 2008, p. 42). The Russian monopoly and exploitation is {{because of the fact that}} during former Soviet’s period, all supply routes of Central Asia were designed in such a way to direct its energy resources only to Russia and left the region with no option but to continue supplying Russian energy market. This approach of exploitation at the hands of Russia has severely thwarted the region’s economic development. The energy corridor will also contribute for economic development of Afghanistan as the country is located in the middle of two regions and can serve as a viable transit corridor for uninterrupted energy. It is a high time for both the region to act as fueling prices are steadily going up since 2002 and delay may cause a severe blow to regional prosperity and to both the economies of India and Pakistan whose people are living below the poverty line (p. 63).|$|R

40|$|William Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s {{family came}} from the area {{surrounding}} Stratford-upon-Avon. William 2 ̆ 7 s father, John Shakespeare, {{was the son of}} a respectable farmer at Snitterfield, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> short <b>miles</b> from Stratford. John arrived in Stratford with a moderate inheritance and set up business as a local merchant and landowner. He is described as being a wool dealer and a glover in Stratford. He purchased two houses; one in Green-hill Street and another in Henley Street. In 1557, John married Mary Arden, daughter of a wealthy land owner, who brought with her an estate called 2 ̆ 2 Ashbies 2 ̆ 2 and an interest in two Snitterfield tenements. John and Mary settled in the house on Henley Street where all of their eight children are believed to have been born. John was successful in business and held many town offices until about the year 1575 when he began to suffer financial difficulties. William, the third child and eldest son in the Shakespeare family, was born when the family was still affluent and influential in Stratford. His christening date was recorded on April 26, 1564 and he spent his first twenty years as a resident of Stratford. It is assumed that William attended the public school in Stratford, which was known for its high quality of education. It was not unusual for boys at the school to be writing fluent Latin by the time they were eleven years old. Unfortunately, John Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s declining financial resources and the burden of supporting a large family made it impossible for William to be sent either to Oxford or to Cambridge upon graduation from the public school in Stratford. The period of time between William 2 ̆ 7 s graduation from public school and his appearance as a successful London dramatist is full of conjecture. Some sources claim he was apprenticed to a butcher, ran off to London and was accepted as a servant into a playhouse. This butcher story, however, most likely had its origin in a tradition that said, 2 ̆ 2 when he (Shakespeare) kill 2 ̆ 7 d a calfe, he would doe it in a high style, and make a speech. 2 ̆ 2 This probably refers to an old semi-dramatic entertainment called 2 ̆ 2 killing the calf 2 ̆ 2 in which the actor, behind a door or screen, using ventriloquism, went through a pretended performance of slaughtering a calf. The more dramatic the performance, the more the crowd enjoyed it. (The Globe_Illustrated Shakespeare, Greenwich House,l 9 B 3) Some historians believed that the youthful Shakespeare must have spent several years working as a law clerk because legal expressions are more frequently and accurately used in his writings than in any other author of the day. However, his familiarity with legal terminology could also be explained by the fact that his father was a leader in Stratford government for many years and the young William could have been exposed to legal proceedings in this way...|$|R
