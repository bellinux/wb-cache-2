Information such as {{sound is}} {{converted}} by a transducer {{such as a}} microphone to an electrical signal, which modulates a radio wave sent from a transmitter.

50|$|Detection {{theory or}} signal {{detection}} theory {{is a means}} to quantify the ability to discern between <b>information-bearing</b> patterns (called stimulus in living organisms, signal in machines) and random patterns that distract from the information (called noise, consisting of background stimuli and random activity of the detection machine and {{of the nervous system}} of the operator). In the field of electronics, the separation of such patterns from a disguising background is referred to as signal recovery.|$|E
5000|$|Demodulation is extracting the {{original}} <b>information-bearing</b> signal from a modulated carrier wave. A demodulator is an electronic circuit (or computer {{program in a}} software-defined radio) {{that is used to}} recover the information content from the modulated carrier wave. [...] There are many types of modulation so there are many types of demodulators. The signal output from a demodulator may represent sound (an analog audio signal), images (an analog video signal) or binary data (a digital signal).|$|E
5000|$|Demodulation: After {{the radio}} signal is {{filtered}} and amplified, the receiver must extract the <b>information-bearing</b> modulation {{signal from the}} modulated radio frequency carrier wave. This is done by a circuit called a demodulator (detector). Each type of modulation uses a matching type of detector for optimum results; FM, for example, works poorly with an AM detector. Many other types of modulation are also used for specialized purposes. These different types of modulation require different demodulation circuits.|$|E

50|$|Thus, Rolf Landauer {{argued in}} 1961, {{if one were}} to imagine {{starting}} with those degrees of freedom in a thermalised state, there would be a real reduction in thermodynamic entropy if they were then re-set to a known state. This can only be achieved under information-preserving microscopically deterministic dynamics if the uncertainty is somehow dumped somewhere else - i.e. if the entropy of the environment (or the non <b>information-bearing</b> degrees of freedom) is increased by at least an equivalent amount, as required by the Second Law, by gaining an appropriate quantity of heat: specifically kT ln 2 of heat for every 1 bit of randomness erased.|$|E
5000|$|Entangled [...] "particles" [...] are emitted in {{a single}} event. Conservation laws ensure that the {{measured}} spin of one particle must be {{the opposite of the}} measured spin of the other, so that if the spin of one particle is measured, the spin of the other particle is now instantaneously known. The most discomforting aspect of this paradox is that the effect is instantaneous so that something that happens in one galaxy could cause an instantaneous change in another galaxy. But, according to Einstein's theory of special relativity, no <b>information-bearing</b> signal or entity can travel at or faster than the speed of light, which is finite. Thus, {{it seems as if the}} Copenhagen interpretation is inconsistent with special relativity.|$|E
5000|$|Distortion is the {{alteration}} {{of the original}} shape (or other characteristic) of something. In communications and electronics it means the {{alteration of}} the waveform of an <b>information-bearing</b> signal, such as an audio signal representing sound or a video signal representing images, in an electronic device or communication channel. Distortion is usually unwanted, and so engineers strive to eliminate or minimize it. In some situations, however, distortion may be desirable. For example, in FM broadcasting and noise reduction systems like the Dolby system, an audio signal is deliberately distorted in ways that emphasize aspects of the signal that are subject to electrical noise, then is symmetrically [...] "undistorted" [...] after passing through a noisy communication channel, reducing the noise in the signal. Distortion is also used as a musical effect, particularly with electric guitars.|$|E
5000|$|Using optical amplifiers, the {{capacity}} of fibers to carry information was dramatically increased {{with the introduction of}} wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) in the early 1990s. AT&T’s Bell Labs developed a WDM process in which a prism split a beam of light into different wavelengths, which could travel through a fiber simultaneously. The peak wavelength of each beam is spaced far enough apart that the beams are distinguishable from each another, creating multiple channels within a single fiber. The earliest WDM systems had only two or four channels—AT&T, for example, deployed a 4-channel long-haul system in 1995. Erbium-doped amplifiers, however, do not amplify signals uniformly across their spectral gain region. During signal regeneration, slight discrepancies in various frequencies introduce an intolerable level of noise into the <b>information-bearing</b> wavelength, making WDM impractical for long-distance fiber communications ...|$|E
50|$|When an <b>information-bearing</b> signal {{passes through}} a {{communication}} channel, it is progressively degraded due to loss of power. For example, when a telephone call {{passes through a}} wire telephone line, some of the power in the electric current which represents the audio signal is dissipated as heat in {{the resistance of the}} copper wire. The longer the wire is, the more power is lost, and the smaller the amplitude of the signal at the far end. So with a long enough wire the call will not be audible at the other end. Similarly, the farther from a radio station a receiver is, the weaker the radio signal, and the poorer the reception. A repeater is an electronic device in a communication channel that increases the power of a signal and retransmits it, allowing it to travel further. Since it amplifies the signal, it requires a source of electric power.|$|E
5000|$|Error {{correction}} allows digital formats {{to tolerate}} {{quite a bit}} more media deterioration than analog formats. That is not to say poorly produced digital media are immune to data loss. Laser rot was most troublesome to the Laserdisc format, but also occurs to some pressed commercial CDs, and was caused in both cases by inadequate disc manufacture. [...] There can occasionally be difficulties related to the use of consumer recordable/rewritable compact discs. This may be due to poor-quality CD recorder drives, low-quality discs, or incorrect storage, as the <b>information-bearing</b> dye layer of most CD-recordable discs is at least slightly sensitive to UV light and will be slowly bleached out if exposed to any amount of it. Most digital recordings rely at least to some extent on computational encoding and decoding and so may become completely unplayable if not enough consecutive good data is available for the decoder to synchronize to the digital data stream, whereas any intact segment of any size of an analog recording is playable.|$|E
50|$|LaserDiscs {{potentially}} had a {{much longer}} lifespan than videocassettes. Because the discs were read optically instead of magnetically, no physical contact {{needs to be made}} between the player and the disc, except for the player's clamp that holds the disc at its center as it is spun and read. As a result, playback would not wear the <b>information-bearing</b> part of the discs, and properly manufactured LDs would theoretically last beyond one's lifetime. By contrast, a VHS tape held all of its picture and sound information on the tape in a magnetic coating which is in contact with the spinning heads on the head drum, causing progressive wear with each use (though later in VHS's lifespan, engineering improvements allowed tapes to be made and played back without contact). Also, the tape was thin and delicate, and it was easy for a player mechanism, especially on a low quality or malfunctioning model, to mishandle the tape and damage it by creasing it, frilling (stretching) its edges, or even breaking it.|$|E
5000|$|In {{support of}} this, Chalmers {{is famous for}} his {{commitment}} to the logical (though, importantly, not natural) possibility of philosophical zombies. These zombies, unlike the zombie of popular fiction, are complete physical duplicates of human beings, lacking only qualitative experience. Chalmers argues that since such zombies are conceivable to us, they must therefore be logically possible. Since they are logically possible, then qualia and sentience are not fully explained by physical properties alone. Instead, Chalmers argues that consciousness is a fundamental property ontologically autonomous of any known (or even possible) physical properties, and that there may be lawlike rules which he terms [...] "psychophysical laws" [...] that determine which physical systems are associated with which types of qualia. He further speculates that all <b>information-bearing</b> systems may be conscious, leading him to entertain the possibility of conscious thermostats and a qualified panpsychism he calls panprotopsychism. Chalmers maintains a formal agnosticism on the issue, even conceding that the viability of panpsychism places him at odds with the majority of his contemporaries. According to Chalmers, his arguments are similar to a line of thought that goes back to Leibniz's 1714 [...] "mill" [...] argument; the first substantial use of philosophical [...] "zombie" [...] terminology may be Robert Kirk's 1974 [...] "Zombies vs. Materialists".|$|E
5000|$|Finally, {{the role}} of the anchor {{correlates}} with the analogous, authority- and <b>information-bearing</b> positions already well-established in American politics, and the benefits it confers upon the political realm elucidate the compatibility between these two systems of information. Once again, Morse outlines this relationship between the anchor and the larger context in which they operate: [...] "since there are few other organs for inclusive and substantial discourse on social and cultural values in American life, the responsibility for interpreting the world and posing a political course of action and a social agenda falls on a very limited number of public personas, including such news personalities and the president". She levies a criticism against the anchor in this case, claiming that by decreasing the number of people responsible for delivering the news, American viewers receive a bottlenecked stream of information about their surroundings. The choreography and performativity involved {{in the construction of the}} news broadcast dramatizes political processes, but in doing so, exposes its flattening of subjectivity and insistence upon itself as the final word of truth. More specifically, [...] "the news media may do 'an important social good when using the techniques of dramaturgy to make governance more interesting to people than would be the case otherwise.' At the same time, however, 'there is an important difference between drama and democracy, with the former requiring spectators and the latter participants.'" [...] In contrast to perceptions of the news as a one-sided relationship with its viewers, some believe that the news works in conjunction with its audience to produce the most efficient picture possible of the world. Tom Brokaw, in speaking about his experiences as a news anchor for NBC, explained how news stories for the length of their duration tend to feed off viewers' demands, and that news is inherently a [...] "populist medium", and that [...] "people are not going to turn to television networks for a historically accurate and detailed description of what happened." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This letter {{focuses on}} the {{broadcasting}} phase of bidirectional cooperative networks with multiple decode-and-forward relays. In this phase, the relays first combine the <b>information-bearing</b> symbols transmitted by the sources, and then broadcast {{them back to the}} sources in order to achieve bidirectional communications. Two different combining methods at the relays are considered. The first one is that the relays transmit linear combinations of the <b>information-bearing</b> symbols to the sources by beamforming. We develop an algorithm that can compute the optimum beamforming vector in closed form and this beamforming vector minimizes the outage probability of the bidirectional cooperative network. The second method is that the relays combine the <b>information-bearing</b> symbols by exclusive-or and then transmit them to the sources by beamforming. For this case, we show that the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratios at the sources depend on the values of the <b>information-bearing</b> symbols. Based on [1], the optimum beamforming vector is computed and it minimizes an upper bound of the outage probability of the bidirectional cooperative network.
