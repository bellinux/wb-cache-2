40|$|Abstract. <b>Gravity</b> <b>abutment</b> widely {{uses for}} {{substructure}} {{part of the}} bridge structure. For many reasons, there are many damages {{take place in the}} parts of abutment. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the strengthening effects on the performance of highly structure of <b>Gravity</b> <b>abutment.</b> ANSYS ver. 10 software is used in the theoretical analysis of capacity of abutment structure. There are two experimental models. The first model uses one ring of carbon fiber sheet and the second uses two rings of carbon fiber sheet. The results of theoretical analysis show that there are good effects when using carbon fiber sheet strengthening method...|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} is a concrete gravity-arch hybrid dam. This design {{was chosen as}} the gorge is too wide for a complete arch so flanking walls form <b>gravity</b> <b>abutments</b> to the central arch.|$|R
50|$|The {{first draft}} {{and the first}} {{topographic}} surveys on the alignment of the dam, were made in 1965 by the Portuguese COBA company. This project involved {{the construction of an}} arch dam, based on two <b>gravity</b> <b>abutments.</b> This project was scrapped by Soviet specialists and construction costs were later significantly reduced. Project Capanda HPP 520 MW was completed in 1989. The successfully project passed inspection by the state experts from the organizations of USSR, Angola and Brazil.|$|R
40|$|The Dokan Reservoir dam is a {{concrete}} cylindrical arch with <b>gravity</b> <b>abutments,</b> {{located on the}} Lesser Zab River about 60  km {{from the city of}} Sulaimani in north-eastern Iraq. A bathymetric survey was conducted in November 2014 for a period of 10  days, using an echo sounder of 200 -kHz single beam. The survey results indicated an annual average sediment deposition of 3. 8  million m 3. Thirty-two sediment samples were collected from the reservoir bed. The ratio of gravel, sand, silt and clay was 15 : 14 : 48 : 23, respectively. The reservoir bed is covered mainly with silt. The sediments are composed of silty clay (77. 6 %), silty sandy clay (10 %), sandy gravely silty clay (1. 2 %) and gravely sandy silty clay (1 %).

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} seismic sliding {{displacement}} calculations of <b>gravity</b> wall bridge <b>abutments</b> when subjected to passive condition during earthquakes. Pseudo-dynamic {{approach has been}} used for the calculation of the passive seismic earth pressure. A novel element of the present investigation is the computation of seismic passive earth pressure coefficients by considering the composite curved rupture surface behind the abutment wall in the framework of limit equilibrium method. Sliding failure along the wall base is considered in the new pseudo-dynamic method. The critical seismic acceleration coefficient for sliding and sliding component Of the displacement, resulting from horizontal and vertical sinusoidal ground accelerations, are computed by using Newmark's sliding block method. The effect of sliding on the response of earth structures is evaluated and comparisons are made between sliding displacements calculated using planar and composite failure mechanisms. Results of the comparative study showed that the assumption of planar failure mechanism for rough soil-wall interfaces significantly overestimates the critical seismic accelerations for sliding and underestimates the sliding displacements...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the reliability-based design {{optimization}} of <b>gravity</b> wall bridge <b>abutments</b> when subjected to active condition during earthquakes. An analytical study considering the effect of uncertainties in the seismic analysis of bridge abutments is presented. Planar failure surface has been considered {{in conjunction with the}} pseudostatic limit equilibrium method for the calculation of the seismic active earth pressure. Analysis is conducted to evaluate the external stability of bridge abutments when subjected to earthquake loads. Reliability analysis is used to estimate the probability of failure in three modes of failure viz. sliding failure of the wall on its base, overturning failure about its toe (or eccentricity failure of the resultant force) and bearing failure of foundation soil below the base of wall. The properties of backfill and foundation soil below the base of abutment are treated as random variables. In addition, the uncertainties associated with characteristics of earthquake ground motions such as horizontal seismic acceleration and shear wave velocity propagating through backfill soil are considered. The optimum proportions of the abutment needed to maintain the stability are obtained against three modes of failure by targeting various component and system reliability indices. Studies have also been made to study the influence of various parameters on the seismic stability...|$|R
40|$|Most of the sub-structures of new railway river bridges in {{the state}} of Odisha are built with solid mass {{concrete}} <b>gravity</b> piers and <b>abutments.</b> These piers do not have steel reinforcement to bear the load as it does not subject to any tensile stress under regular type of loading. Safety of these piers is of major concern during high magnitude earthquake as frequent occurrence of such earthquakes is observed in India in recent times. Failure of pier may result in loss of functionality of Railway Bridge leading to the cut down of rail communication line for an indefinite amount of time and a huge loss to the society. This study aims to assess the vulnerability of the solid gravity bridge piers which forms the important component of railway bridges as the load transfer between substructure and superstructure takes through them. In the present study seven existing piers from the state of Odisha are evaluated using free vibration analysis and nonlinear static (pushover) analysis. Free-vibration analysis of the bridge pier shows that the mass participation of fundamental mode is always below 50 %. Also, the cumulative mass participation for first six mode is found to be less than 80 % for all the selected bridge pier. This indicates the significant contribution of higher modes. The pushover analysis indicates the brittle mode of failure of all the bridge piers at ultimate load. This is due to poor energy dissipation capacity of the mass concrete used for building these structures...|$|R
