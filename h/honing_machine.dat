50|$|A <b>honing</b> <b>machine,</b> ironically, is {{relatively}} accurate and perfect. Instead {{of relying on}} {{the accuracy of the}} machine tool, it relies on the averaging effect between the stone and the workpiece. In fact, compliance is a requirement of a <b>honing</b> <b>machine</b> that is necessary for the averaging effect to occur. This leads to an obvious difference between the two machines: in a grinder the stone is rigidly attached to a slide, while in honing the stone is actuated with pneumatic or hydraulic pressure.|$|E

Because of {{the high}} {{precision}} in roundness, straightness and roughness, {{it is very difficult}} to machining the inner surface of injection nozzle. <b>Honing</b> <b>machine</b> is the main equipment for machining the injection nozzle. The key honing control techniques and honing test for injection nozzle on the developed high precision vertical <b>honing</b> <b>machine</b> are analyzed. The quantitative expansion，which is one of the most important feeding styles in honing process, is discussed in detail. Some machining tests on the developed <b>honing</b> <b>machine</b> are made and the work pieces of injection nozzles with inner surface Φ 11 mm are honed successfully with roundness tolerance less than 0. 4 µm, straightness tolerance less than 1 µm and roughness tolerance less than 0. 04 µm...|$|E

50|$|In 1942, at {{the height}} of World War II, Bill Brodey was engaged in selling various tools and {{machines}} including Joseph Sunnen <b>honing</b> <b>machines</b> used for <b>honing</b> cylinder bores of engines. Torque wrenches were being imported and sold alongside of the <b>honing</b> <b>machines</b> because it was known that uneven torque tightening of engine cylinder head bolts would distort the cylinder bore. Bill and his friend Ernest Thornitt applied to the UK Ministry of Supply requesting permission to manufacture torque wrenches in the UK. Torque wrenches were much in demand for the manufacture of Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engines and the UK Government was keen to manufacture in the UK wherever possible to reduce pressure on the Atlantic supply convoys. Consequently, permission was granted to 'The North Bar Tool Company' to start manufacturing torque wrenches in 'North Bar Place', Banbury in the United Kingdom. The address 'North Bar' gave the company its name and this was later contracted to 'Norbar'.|$|R
40|$|Extrusion honing is a {{technique}} used for the finish machining of engineering components. The process {{may be used to}} deburr, radius or polish depending on the specific application. Extrusion honing utilises a polyborosiloxane polymer, which is mixed with fine abrasive particles and forced through or around components using an extrusion <b>honing</b> <b>machine</b> to achieve the machining action. It is evident that the machining process is very dependent upon the physical and mechanical characteristics of the polyborosiloxane. However, the process to date has largely been developed empirically, and further developments will require a greater understanding {{of the relationship between the}} characteristics of the polymer and the machining action. The rheology of the C- 11 polyborosiloxane has been investigated using a concentric cylinder, a slit-die and a capillary rheometer. The shear history of the polyborosiloxane prior to testing with the capillary rheometer was found to significantly affect the results produced. At shear strain rates up to 100 s- 1 and a temperature of 30 °C the rheology of the polyborosiloxane has been approximated to a power law equation (K. = 989 KPas; n= 0. 935). At shear strain rates greater than 100 s- 1 the pseudoplasticity of the polyborosiloxane increases significantly. Using this power law equation the velocity, shear strain rate and the shear stress within the polyborosiloxane in an extrusion die has been modelled mathematically. In some cases the extrusion barrel pressure and the mass flow rate through the extrusion die have both been shown to vary considerably during the constant ram velocity extrusion of polyborosiloxane in the capillary rheometer. It is tentatively proposed that such variations in the extrusion barrel pressure during capillary flow are a result of periodic slipping and sticking of the polyborosiloxane to the extrusion die wall. This mechanism is thought to be considerably influenced by the polyborosiloxane temperature, the extrusion ram velocity and the flow passage geometry. It is proposed that the measured variations in the mass flow rate of the polyborosiloxane through the extrusion dies are a result of pressure induced density variations within the extrusion barrel. This mechanism has been mathematically modelled. Temperature profiles within the C- 11 polyborosiloxane have been measured on an extrusion <b>honing</b> <b>machine</b> and the results suggest significant heat generation towards the periphery of the restriction. These results have been used to model mathematically the heat generation and transfer within the polyborosiloxane during operation of the extrusion <b>honing</b> <b>machine.</b> It is proposed that heat generation during extrusion honing is by friction at the medium/workpiece interface and internal shear within the medium. Both of these mechanisms would cause the greatest heat generation towards the periphery of an orifice restriction...|$|E

40|$|The honing {{temperature}} of a cylindrical workpiece of steel is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The experiment {{is carried out}} by using a vertical <b>honing</b> <b>machine</b> consisting of a constant pressure stone system. The temperature distribution in the workpiece is measured {{by means of a}} thermocouple formed by spot welding {{at the bottom of a}} small hole. The influence of its temperature on the finishing accuracy is also studied. The results obtained are as follows. The change of the cutting condition of sticks can be found from the variation of temperature in the surface layer of a workpiece. On the distribution of temperature in the workpiece, its gradient in the radial direction is small, but that in the axial direction is not so small. Using the suitable model of honing operation, the theoretical equations representing the influence of honing conditions on the {{temperature of}} workpiece were obtained. These equations explain the experimental result well. For example, the temperature becomes larger in proportion to the honing speed and the stone pressure, and the heat flux into the workpiece decreases as operation proceeds...|$|E
50|$|The path of {{the stone}} {{is not the only}} {{difference}} between grinding and <b>honing</b> <b>machines,</b> they also differ in the stiffness of their construction.

40|$|Abstract. Existing laser <b>honing</b> <b>machines</b> all {{utilize the}} motion mode of {{workpiece}} movement. But as to complex workpiece, this mode is inappropriate to use. For example, cylinder liner, pre-casted into the engine block, is not suitable to rotate when {{fixed on the}} chuck, because the block is irregular and heavy. This equipment uses the mode of laser head rotation and linear motion. The workpiece keeps still during the laser texturing process. In this paper, the structure design and control principle of the laser machine are narrated in detail. The process of the machine is a new method of laser micro-texturing, named as “single-pulse interval of the same point many times”. The method contributes to processing microscopic or macroscopic morphology and significantly reduces the negative thermal effects of laser processing...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of honed surfaces {{is one of}} the most important tasks in tribology. Although many established techniques exist for texture characterization, such as SEM, tactile stylus or white-light interferometry, none of them is suited for a machine integrated measurement. Harsh conditions such as the presence of cooling lubricant or vibrations prohibit the use of commercial sensors inside a <b>honing</b> <b>machine.</b> Instead, machined engine blocks need time-consuming cleaning and preparation while taken out of the production line for inspection. A full inspection of all produced parts is hardly possible this way. Within this paper, an approach for a machine-integrated measurement is presented, which makes use of optical sensors for texture profiling. The cooling lubricant here serves as immersion medium. The results of test measurements with a chromatic-confocal sensor and a fiber-optical low-coherence interferometer show the potential of both measuring principles for our appr oach. Cooling lubricant temperature and flow, scanning speed and measurement frequency have been varied in the tests. The sensor with best performance will later be chosen for machine integration...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, a new {{methodology}} {{is presented to}} translate roughness results from a test machine to different industrial machines without the need to stop production for a long time. First, mathematical models were searched for average roughness Ra in finish honing processes, in both a test and an industrial machine. Regression analysis was employed for obtaining quadratic models. Main factor influencing average roughness Ra was grain size, followed by pressure. Afterwards, several experiments were simulated in the common range of variables for the two machines using the models for average roughness Ra. A new variable DifRa corresponding {{to the difference between}} roughness values from the test machine and the industrial machine was defined and a quadratic model was obtained. Once DifRa is modeled, it is possible to predict roughness in a different industrial <b>honing</b> <b>machine</b> from results of the test machine by performing a few experiments in the industrial machine and translating the curves. This will reduce the number of tests to be performed in industrial machines. The suggested new methodology has been tested with two more roughness parameters, maximum height of profile Rz and core roughness depth Rk, proving its validity.

40|$|The texture {{change during}} {{running-in}} alters {{the performance and}} efficiency of a tribo-mechanical system. During mass production of cylinder liners, a final finishing stage known as ‘‘plateau honing’’ is commonly added to reduce the running-in wear process of the liner surface. The majority of researchers think that this operation improves the engine efficiency and decreases oil consumption. It was believed that there are close links between the surface topography of honed cylinders change and their wear resistance during running-in. However, these interactions {{have not yet been}} established. Some running-in wear models were developed in the open literature to predict topographical surface changes without considering the running-in conditions. The present paper thus investigates the various aspects of the wear modeling that caused running- in problems in honed surfaces and its implications on ring-pack friction performance. To illustrate this, plateau honing experiments under different conditions were first carried out on an instrumented vertical <b>honing</b> <b>machine.</b> The plateau honing experiments characterize the surface modifications during running-in wear of cast-iron engine bores using advanced characterization method. Based on the experimental evidence, a running-in wear model was developed. Finally, a numerical extension of the developed model was applied to solve the Reynolds equation by taking into account the real surface topographies of the engine bore. This enables us to predict realistic friction performance within the cylinder ring-pack tribosystem...|$|E
5000|$|Examples of {{stick-slip}} can {{be heard}} from hydraulic cylinders, tractor wet brakes, <b>honing</b> <b>machines</b> etc. Special dopes {{can be added to}} the hydraulic fluid or the cooling fluid to overcome or minimize the stick-slip effect. Stick-slip is also experienced in lathes, mill centres, and other machinery where something slides on a slideway. Slideway oils typically list [...] "prevention of stick-slip" [...] as one of their features. Other examples of the stick-slip phenomenon include the music that comes from bowed instruments, the noise of car brakes and tires, and the noise of a stopping train. Stick-slip also has been observed in articular cartilage in mild loading and sliding conditions, which could result in an abrasive wear of the cartilage. Another example of the stick-slip phenomenon occurs when musical notes are played with a glass harp by rubbing a wet finger along the rim of a crystal wine glass. One animal that produces sound using stick-slip friction is the spiny lobster which rubs its antennae over smooth surfaces on its head. Another, more common example which produces sound using stick-slip friction is the grasshopper.|$|R

40|$|Fixed-field intensity-modulated treatments, {{delivered}} by conventional linac-plus-multileaf systems, have rapidly {{become the most}} common form of IMRT. Several innovative alternative IMRT options are also now available, including tomotherapy, CyberKnife and jaws-only linacs. These innovative approaches have divergent rationales. Jaws-only IMRT is being developed because it allows treatments to be delivered using conventional linacs without expensive multileaf collimators and not because it improves dose distributions. On the other hand, tomotherapy and CyberKnife systems have different geometric degrees of freedom, beam sizes and modulation techniques than those of conventional linacs, which may enable these innovative systems to deliver superior dose distributions to some treatment sites. Because conventional linacs are themselves finely <b>honed</b> <b>machines,</b> enhancement of one aspect of machine performance is sometimes accompanied by diminution of another. For example, tomotherapy systems possess an enhanced rotational IMRT capability but currently can only deliver coplanar radiation beams. Thus the various delivery systems may prove optimal for different types of treatments, specific machine designs excelling for specific disease sites. In practice, of course, IMRT delivery systems will be distinguished not just by the quality of the dose distributions they deliver but also by factors not discussed in this chapter, such as the efficiency of their treatment process, the integration of on-board imaging into that process, and their ability to measure, minimise and compensate for the effects of respiratory motion, a major detriment to accurate IMRT delivery...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHoning is a {{machining}} {{process that can}} economically produce very exact bores regarding form, geometry and surface quality. It is mainly used as the final finishing operation for ready made parts and typically conducted on the inner surface of a cylinder. Due to their specific surface structure which has a good ability to keep lubricants and a high wear resistance, honed parts usually serve as functional surfaces to guide moved parts. Today, the main fields for applications of honing technology {{can be found in}} most sectors of the metal working industry, e. g. the automotive industries, hydraulic and pneumatic manufacture and aircraft industries. During the long-stroke honing process the tool, equipped with one or several abrasive honing stones, is performing three overlaying movement components. These are a rotational movement, an oscillating stroke movement in axial direction and the radial feed movement of the honing stone. This feed movement is one of the decisive factors for the results of the honing process. It can be realized through feed control or, in a more recent approach, through force control strategies. By feed controlled honing, the position of the honing stone is changed in defined invariable steps in certain time intervals. In contrast, by force controlled honing the force of the honing stone {{against the wall of the}} workpiece is measured indirectly by a force sensor, which is located within the feed unit of the <b>honing</b> <b>machine.</b> A required force value is given and, if necessary, the honing stone is fed outwards to reach and maintain a constant cutting force throughout the honing process. This constant force is supposed to produce better results of the honing process in terms of geometric and form accuracy as well as surface structure. The presented research studies aim at improving process know-how to further increase the production accuracy and process repeatability. In a comparison between parts honed with the two different feeding strategies for the honing stone, force components and moments were analyzed and correlated to the phases of the process and several influencing parameters. In addition to the forces and moments measured during the honing process, the quality parameters of the honed parts have also been analyzed and compared...|$|E
40|$|Fixed-field treatments, {{delivered}} using conventional clinical {{linear accelerators}} fitted with multileaf collimators, have rapidly become the standard form of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Several innovative nonstandard alternatives also exist, for which delivery and treatment planning systems are now commercially available. Three of these nonstandard IMRT approaches are reviewed here: tomotherapy, robotic linear accelerators (CyberKnife, Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and standard linear accelerators modulated by jaws alone or by their jaws acting {{together with a}} tertiary beam-masking device. Rationales for the nonstandard IMRT approaches are discussed, and elements of their delivery system designs are briefly described. Differences between fixed-field IMRT dose distributions and the distributions that can be delivered by using the nonstandard technologies are outlined. Because conventional linear accelerators are finely <b>honed</b> <b>machines,</b> innovative design enhancement of one aspect of system performance often limits another facet of machine capability. Consequently the various delivery systems may prove optimal for different types of treatment, with specific machine designs excelling for disease sites with specific target volume and normal structure topologies.

50|$|The general {{pattern of}} {{development}} for wealthy nations was {{a transition from}} a primary industry based economy to a manufacturing based one, {{and then to a}} service based economy. Romania did not follow this pattern, manufacturing has always been secondary, though certainly not unimportant. In part because of this, Romania did not suffer as greatly from the pains of deindustrialization in the 1970s and 1980s. Manufacturers have been attracted to Romania due to the highly educated population with lower labour costs than the EU. Romania's government-run healthcare system is also an important attraction, as it exempts companies from the high health insurance costs they must pay in the EU.

5000|$|Die {{grinders}} and rotary {{tools are}} handheld power tools used for grinding, sanding, <b>honing,</b> polishing, or <b>machining</b> material (typically metal, but also plastic or wood). All such tools are conceptually similar, with no bright {{dividing line between}} die grinders and rotary tools, although the die grinder name tends {{to be used for}} pneumatically driven heavy-duty versions whereas the rotary tool name tends to be used for electric lighter-duty versions. Flexible shaft drive versions also exist. The die grinder name comes from one of their earliest and archetypal applications, tool and die work, where they were used to create the precise contours of dies or molds. Especially before the advent of widespread CNC usage, they were heavily relied upon for contouring via manual skill comparable to a sculptor's. CNC now provides much of the contouring for die and mold interior surfaces, but die grinders are still very useful for hundreds of cutting needs, from sculpture-like contouring in the absence of CNC, to cut-off of bar stock, to any of the cutting and grinding needs of fabrication, such as in the work of welders, boilermakers, millwrights, ironworkers (steel erectors), sheet metal workers (such as auto body workers and HVAC technicians), to woodworking (especially cabinet making), hacking, and other hobby or business pursuits.

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in the data volumes encountered in many application domains has led to widespread adoption of parallel and distributed data management systems like parallel databases and MapReduce-based frameworks (e. g., Hadoop) in recent years. Use of such parallel and distributed frameworks is expected to accelerate in the coming years, putting further strain on already-scarce resources like compute power, network bandwidth, and energy. To reduce total execution times, there is a trend towards increasing execution parallelism by spreading out data across {{a large number of}} machines. However, this often increases the total resource consumption, and especially energy consumption, significantly because of process startup costs and other overheads (e. g., communication overheads). In this dissertation, we develop several data management techniques to minimize resource consumption through workload consolidation. In this dissertation, we introduce a key metric called query span, i. e., number of machines involved in the execution of a query or a job. In order to minimize the per query resource consumption we propose to minimize query span. To that end, we develop several workload-driven data partitioning and replica selection algorithms that attempt to minimize the average query span by exploiting the fact that most distributed environments need to use replication for fault tolerance. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that judicious data placement and replication can dramatically reduce the average query spans resulting in significant reductions in resource consumption. We show our results primarily on two applications, distributed data warehouse system and distributed information retrieval. In the first case, we show that minimizing average query spans can minimize overall resource consumption for a given workload and can also improve the performance of complex analytical queries. In the second case, our approach minimizes the overall search cost as well as effectively trades off search cost with load imbalance. The best case of resource efficiency for any underlying data processing system is achieved when the job or the query can be run efficiently on a single machine (i. e., query span= 1). In the final part of dissertation, we discuss an in-memory MapReduce system optimized for performing complex analytics tasks on input data sizes that fit in a single machine's memory. We argue that systems like Hadoop that are designed to operate across a large number of machines are not optimal in performance for small and medium sized complex analytics tasks because of high startup costs, heavy disk activity, and wasteful checkpointing. We have developed a prototype runtime called HONE that is API compatible with standard (distributed) Hadoop. In other words, we can take existing Hadoop code and run it, without modification, on a multi-core shared memory machine. This allows us to take existing Hadoop algorithms and find the most suitable runtime environment for execution on datasets of varying sizes. Overall, in this dissertation, our key contributions in this work include identification of key metric query span and its relationship with overall resource consumption in scale-out architectures. We introduce several workload-aware techniques to optimize this key metric. We go on to demonstrate the effectiveness of query span minimization on different application scenarios. In order to take advantage of scale-up architectures effectively we develop novel in-memory MapReduce system <b>HONE</b> for single <b>machine.</b> Our thorough experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approaches...|$|R
