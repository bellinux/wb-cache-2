Hamilton led a boarding party to retake Hermione and, after an exceptionally bloody action, sailed her out of danger under Spanish gunfire. The Spanish casualties included 119 dead; the British took 231 Spaniards prisoner, while another 15 jumped or fell overboard. Hamilton had 11 men injured, four seriously, but none killed. Hamilton himself was severely wounded.|$|E
5|$|Although Favorite was wrecked, over 200 of {{her crew}} and soldier-passengers {{had reached the}} land and, having set fire to their ship, {{prepared}} to march on Port St. George {{under the leadership of}} Colonel Gifflenga. Two British midshipmen left in command of the town organised the British and indigenous population into a defensive force and marched to meet Gifflenga. The junior British officers informed Gifflenga that the return of the British squadron would bring overwhelming numbers of sailors, marines and naval artillery to bear on his small force and that if he surrendered immediately he could expect better terms. Gifflenga recognised that his position was untenable and capitulated. At Port St. George, the Venetian gunboat Lodola sneaked unnoticed into the harbour and almost captured a Sicilian privateer, Vincitore. The raider was driven off by the remaining garrison of the town without the prize, while attempting to manoeuvre <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bay.|$|E

As the battle is ending, Amelia and Kanyenke pass under an archway in which Beaumont is concealed. Beaumont jumps down and attempts to stab Amelia but Kanyenke pushes <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way. All three tumble to the ground. Beaumont charges at Amelia, about to stab her, but when Beaumont gets near, Amelia kicks him and pushes him backwards. He quickly charges at her again, but she grabs her shotgun and shoots him. Amelia later uses the Circle's stored treasure to revive the Falcon Company and succeeds in building railroads to the west coast.|$|E
5|$|At a temple, which Meera visits as {{her daily}} ritual, Zeenat makes her first contact. Zeenat is {{too afraid to}} tell Meera {{the truth about the}} situation, and she does not reveal who she is or why she has come. Over a few weeks, they become good friends and spend most of the time together. Their {{friendship}} brings out the missing part in each of their personalities. In the process, Zeenat realizes helplessness; this is totally new to her forthright way of thinking. Meera, on the other hand, gets a glimpse of freedom; this brings <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shell of the traditions in her haveli and gives her a new perspective on her life.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{release from}} Motown was made final on February 22, 1968, when she {{received}} a one-time payment of US$139,804.94 in royalties and earnings. She attempted a solo career with ABC Records, {{and was forced to}} formally reject a solo contract offered by Motown as part of her settlement. Ballard's two 1968 singles failed to chart and her solo album was shelved. In 1971, Ballard sued Motown for $8.7million, claiming that Gordy and Diana Ross had conspired to force <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group; the judge ruled in favor of Motown. Ballard eventually sank into poverty and died abruptly on February 22, 1976 from coronary thrombosis at the age of 32. At the time of her death, she had begun to make financial and personal strides and was planning to reinvigorate her solo career.|$|E

5|$|Dexter's Laboratory (commonly {{abbreviated}} as Dexter's Lab) is an American comic {{science fiction}} animated television series created by Genndy Tartakovsky for Cartoon Network, {{and the first}} of the network's Cartoon Cartoons. The series follows Dexter, a boy-genius and inventor with a secret laboratory in the basement of his house, who constantly battles his sister Dee Dee in an attempt to keep <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lab. He also engages in a bitter rivalry with his neighbor and fellow-genius Mandark. The first two seasons contained additional segments: Dial M for Monkey, which focuses on Dexter's pet lab-monkey/superhero, and The Justice Friends, about a trio of superheroes who share an apartment.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up {{much of the time}} that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying in tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help to pull <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the orphanage}} staff {{who thought that}} Monroe would be happier living in a family, Grace became her legal {{guardian}} in 1936, although she {{was not able to}} take <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orphanage until the summer of 1937. Monroe's second stay with the Goddards lasted only a few months, as Doc molested her. After staying with various of her and Grace's relatives and friends in Los Angeles and Compton, Monroe found a more permanent home in September 1938, when she began living with Grace's aunt, Ana Atchinson Lower, in the Sawtelle district. She was enrolled in Emerson Junior High School and was taken to weekly Christian Science services with Lower. While otherwise a mediocre student, Monroe excelled in writing and contributed to the school's newspaper. Due to the elderly Lower's health issues, Monroe returned to live with the Goddards in Van Nuys in either late 1940 or early 1941. After graduating from Emerson, she began attending Van Nuys High School.|$|E

5|$|Eufemija (also {{known as}} Marija, Ofka, and Anka) married Bolesław Jerzy II of Galicia, in modern-day Ukraine, in 1331. The {{marriage}} was engineered in 1323 when the brothers Lev and Andrew of Galicia were slain without leaving heirs. Instead of {{replacing them with}} his own son Liubartas and risking a war with Poland, Gediminas forged a compromise with Władysław I of Poland. Both parties agreed to install Bolesław, cousin of Władysław I and nephew of Gediminas' son-in-law Wacław of Płock, with the marriage to take place later. Bolesław {{at the time was}} fourteen years old. In this way the war for control of Galicia–Volhynia was postponed until after Bolesław's poisoning in 1340; control of the area was not stabilized until 1370. According to Teodor Narbutt, Eufemija was drowned beneath the ice of the Vistula River on 5 February 1342 in order to keep <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> succession disputes.|$|E
5|$|James and Stratus teamed {{together}} at the March 18, 2006 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event to defeat Candice Michelle and Victoria. After the match, James agreed to honor Stratus' wishes and attempted to kiss her. After Stratus pushed her away, James attacked Stratus and vowed to destroy her, becoming a villain in the process {{for the first time}} in her WWE career. The feud between James and Stratus culminated in a Women's Championship match at WrestleMania 22, which James won, to earn her first Women's Championship. Her angle with Stratus continued into Backlash during a rematch, after Stratus legitimately dislocated her shoulder when James threw <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring. The feud would come to an end on the June 26 episode of Raw, when James defeated Stratus in a Women's Championship match.|$|E
5|$|Lady Crane {{returns to}} her {{chambers}} to find a wounded Arya Stark hiding inside, and helps stitch her wounds.

She then offers to have Arya join them, but she refuses, saying that she intends to travel west of Westeros to see {{the edge of the}} world. As Arya recovers, The Waif arrives and kills Lady Crane, intending to kill Arya as well. Arya flees through the streets of Braavos, but during the chase, Arya's wounds reopen and she limps back to her hideout with the Waif in close pursuit. As the Waif closes in, Arya uses Needle to cut a candle, plunging the room into total darkness, where, having been trained while blinded for several weeks, Arya gains the upper hand.|$|E

Encouraged by Navarro, Roman opens the sarcophagus, exposing himself to an {{airborne}} virus. As he begins to turn, Navarro guns him down and orders his men to secure the statue {{so that he can}} sell the virus to the highest bidder on the black market. Nate jumps onto the net carrying the treasure which is connected to the transport chopper while a captive Elena gets the pilot killed, causing it to crash on Navarro's cargo ship. Nate kills the remaining mercenaries and attempts to rescue Elena, only to be attacked by Navarro. After a fistfight, he pulls <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chopper and pushes it overboard, taking Navarro, whose leg is tangled in the rope connected to the net, and the statue with it {{to the bottom of the}} sea.|$|E
5|$|On December 20, 2009, {{during a}} {{counseling}} session with two colleagues to discuss her poor time-keeping, Manning {{was told she}} would lose her one day off a week for persistent lateness.

A sergeant moved Manning away from the weapons rack, and other soldiers pinned her arms behind her back and dragged <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room. Several witnesses to the incident believed her access to sensitive material {{ought to have been}} withdrawn at that point. The following month, January 2010, she began posting on Facebook that she felt hopeless and alone.|$|E
5|$|On the July 17 {{episode of}} Raw, Candice was the Special Guest Referee during a tag team match of Stratus and Wilson against Victoria and Mickie James. James entered the match without being tagged in, so Candice threw <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring. Afterwards, Victoria tried to clothesline Candice, but she ducked {{out of the}} way, {{allowing}} Stratus to perform a Stratusfaction for the victory. As {{a result of her}} participation in the match, Candice became a fan favorite. On the Raw following Unforgiven, Candice won a match against Lita. The next week, in her second match against Lita, Candice was pinned after she was speared by guest referee Edge, {{in the first round of}} the WWE Women's Championship tournament. On the November 27 episode of Raw, during the Diva battle royal, Candice suffered a legitimate broken nose when Victoria kicked her in the face. She had surgery on November 30 to repair her deviated septum.|$|E
