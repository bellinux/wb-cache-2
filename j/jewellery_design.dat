Every printable material has its very own constraints that have to be considered while designing the piece of jewellery using 3D Modelling Software.|$|E

50|$|The {{twentieth century}} is where this {{rudimentary}} {{change in the}} public’s attitude towards <b>jewellery</b> <b>design</b> and function is most apparent.

Additionally, no one trend {{can be seen as}} the history of <b>jewellery</b> <b>design</b> for this time period. Throughout the twentieth century <b>jewellery</b> <b>design</b> underwent drastic and continual style changes: Art Nouveau (1900-1918), Art Deco (1919-1929), International Style & organicism (1929-1946), New Look & Pop (1947-1967), Globalization, Materialism, and Minimalism. <b>Jewellery</b> <b>design</b> trends are highly affected by the economic and social states of the time. The boundaries of styles and trends tend to blur together and the clear stylistic divisions of the past are harder to see during the twentieth century.|$|E
