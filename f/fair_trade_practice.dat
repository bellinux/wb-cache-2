40|$|University of Minnesota M. A. thesis. December 2010. Major: Design, Housing, and Apparel. Advisor:Dr. Gloria Williams. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iv, 62 pages, appendices A-C. There {{has been a}} backlash by concerned consumers in the global north against free trade policies, also known as trade liberalization, {{in the last two}} decades. The <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> system has been established {{as an alternative to the}} free trade system. The following study examines the <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> and marketing strategies of three apparel businesses based in Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota. This case study resulted in three findings related to <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices.</b> First, the businesses were all established as <b>fair</b> <b>trade,</b> which demonstrates that <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> is an integral part of the mission of the companies. Second, the wholesalers in this study considered some <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> to be more important than others. Finally, in order to ensure that their companies are utilizing <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices,</b> the business owners in this study preferred to maintain short supply chains by working closely with their producers and suppliers. In the marketing of <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> apparel, the businesses in this study relied heavily on their websites and points-of-purchase signage to inform consumers about their products. The lack of a standardized logo for labels on <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> apparel has meant that the businesses have had to find creative ways to communicate their <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> to consumers...|$|R
5000|$|Gandhi {{promoted}} {{the idea that}} businesses have a trustee role in being responsible to the customers, workers, shareholders, and their community. In particular, Gandhi said that [...] "A customer {{is the most important}} visitor on our premises. He is not dependent upon us. We are dependent upon him. He is not an interruption in our work - he is the purpose of it. We are not doing him a favor by serving him. He is doing us a favor by giving us the opportunity to serve him". United States consumer advocate Ralph Nader called Gandhi [...] "the greatest consumer advocate the world has seen" [...] for advancing the concept that commercial enterprise should serve the consumer and that the consumer should expect to be served by business. Vinoba Bhave and Jayaprakash Narayan, two great proponents of Gandhi's philosophy, and V. V. Giri and Lal Bahadur Shastri, contemporary Indian president and prime minister, similarly expected the business community to regulate itself as an expression of responsibility to contribute to society. These ideas were developed by some business leaders. In July 1966 in Bombay some people founded the <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practice</b> Association, which was later renamed the Council for Fair Business Practice. This is now seen as a sincere effort toward promoting business self-regulation, despite consumer activists' criticism that self-regulation would not provide sufficient protection to consumers.|$|E

40|$|As a theologically {{inspired}} {{action that}} {{has captured the}} attention of a wide public, Fair Trade action by churches {{can be viewed as a}} successful form of Public Theology. Despite the popularity of Fair Trade, and the considerable Church involvement in its promotion, little attention has been paid by academic theology to the public impact of church support for Fair Trade. This research sets out to correct this oversight by bringing together the study of Fair Trade and Public Theology for the greater illumination of both. Using a qualitative study, consisting of twenty-five in depth interviews of community stakeholders and churchgoers, this research asks to what extent, and in what ways, this action is ‘public’ and examines the nature and content of the theology of the churchgoers in regard to Fair Trade. This research contributes to the better understanding of the nature of support for Fair Trade. My investigation of the theology of the churchgoers indicates that their beliefs shape their understanding of what Fair Trade is. They view Fair Trade as an act of justice and as demonstration of Christian principles in action. The churchgoers’ desire for Fair Trade to ‘live up’ to these theologically inspired ideals leads them to defend forms of <b>Fair</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>practice</b> that offer a distinctive alternative to mainstream trade. My analysis of Fair Trade action by churches complements the existing body of knowledge on Public Theology, by offering detailed example of the practical outworking of some of the key points of discussion within the discourse. Using Fair Trade action by churches as a case study of a specific form of Public Theology in practice, I indicate the ways in which engagement between the Church and a wider audience can be balanced with the exercise of a distinctive theological voice. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{educators}} introduce {{students to}} basic concepts {{and practices of}} sustainable development by exploring fair trade in the world today. They guide students in researching, creating, and implementing fair trade projects in different disciplinary contexts and help students understand fair trade practices {{as a part of}} sustainable development. When fair trade works best, it develops equal, long-term relationships between producers and consumers in the world, encourages ecologically-friendly production, transparent gender and ethnic-inclusive business practices, facilitates the emergence of long-term networks of cooperatives that practice democratic decision making, and creates new economic power bases in the global South with support from equitable trading partners in the global North. Fair trade is part of sustainable development because <b>fair</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practice</b> represents an innovation in ecological, economic, political, and social relations. These new regional-to-global linkages are designed to provide long-term stability for the world’s people and environment. In their respective fields, the educators define sustainable development holistically, involving ecological, social, cultural, economic, and political relationships. Promoting sustainability involves the conservation and re-use of natural resources in addition to the generation of long-term, socio-economic ways of living that restore ecosystems and global human relationships. This is a departure from traditional definitions of sustainability; the educators’ pedagogical perspective moves beyond the physical realm to incorporate the development of social relations between people. Defined in this way, sustainability is an integral component in the educators’ disciplines. As presenters at the Conference, the educators will describe how they integrate fair trade education into their fields and programs. These include Interior Architecture and Product Design, Women’s Studies, Nonviolence Studies, the Campaign for Nonviolence, and the KSU Fair Trade Week and Marketplace. In Interior Architecture and Product Design, the educator works with students on conceptual designs for a fair trade cooperative in La Esperanza, Nicaragua. This project engages students in activities on and off campus, exposing students to the wide range of issues relating to sustainability and fair trade. In Women’s Studies, another educator introduces students to active learning via academic readings and volunteer work with the KSU Fair Trade Week. Students design and sell fair trade t-shirts that are obtained from U. S. based fair trade groups that work with women-owned cooperatives in Mexico and Nicaragua. By teaching nonviolence studies, this educator helps students develop an awareness of workplace exploitation in the U. S. and other countries, and to understand how alternative relations are established. In addition, the educator works with the Campaign for Nonviolence, Nonviolence Studies, and Women’s Studies to initiate learning experiences in Central America that will enable the student organization “Engineers Beyond Borders” (as supervised by Civil Engineer David Chandler) to design renewable energy systems, using solar, water, and wind power for fair trade cooperatives and their workplace production.
