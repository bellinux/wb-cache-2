40|$|AbstractQuantitative {{characterization}} techniques {{based on}} fracture mechanics were proposed {{and used to}} examine the interface strength in multilayered structures. Novel in situ micro-fracture testing for nanolayers inside a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is developed to observe fracture evolution during bending deformation of nanolayered films. Other quantitative technique on interface fracture mechanics has been the 4 -point bending or double cantilever beam bending methods. In this paper we will discuss about these two techniques and their applications. In particular, the Double Cantilever Beam bending test method using <b>Delaminator</b> v 8. 2 Adhesion testing system has been used to quantify the adhesion strength between the Solar PV backsheet and encapsulant. The environmental conditions in tropical countries makes the photovoltaics components vulnerable to salt mist and water vapour as well as acid penetration. Under moisture condition, the hydrolysis reaction of water vapour with backsheet materials release acetic acid, causing delamination and further corrosion of the encapsulant and inter-metallic connectors on solar cells by the salt mist leading to electrical shorts, heat accumulation and fire. Understanding the interface strength between these two materials and its degradation with typical environments in tropical and near-ocean regions is instrumental to enable robust and reliable solar PV technology for such regions...|$|E

Three dimensional stacked integrated circuits (3 D SIC) present a potential technology that can enhance system performance based on interconnect and packaging techniques. Contemporary vertical stacking of Si chips in 3 D SIC technology is based on through-Si vias and microbumps. Compared to two dimensional integrated circuits, these vertical interconnects enable shorter signal paths that lead to lower signal delay and reduced power consumption. Extensive research is being done on the electrical properties of TSVs and microbumps. Furthermore, the thermo-mechanical impact of TSVs on the back-end-of-line (BEOL) and Si is being investigated. However, {{little is known about}} the thermo-mechanical impact of chip-package interaction (CPI) on Si in 3 D SIC technology. Therefore, this thesis focuses on detecting mechanical stress mechanisms occuring after 3 D IC stacking and packaging and the impact of those stresses on FEOL devices in Si. Within this thesis, the linear piezoresistance model, originally developed for bulk Si, is applied to describe the response of FEOL devices to stress. In this case, the piezocoefficients represent the stress sensitivity of the whole device, rather than bulk material. A stress sensor evaluation methodology is proposed and implemented within the thesis. Stress sensitivity of several FEOL device types and through several FEOL technology nodes was assessed. FEOL devices were calibrated to in-plane and out-of-planestress. The stress sensitivities are analyzed from two perspectives: To gain information on the nature of stress sensitivity of FEOL devices and itstrends through scaling technology nodes Their applicability for usage as FEOL CPI stress sensorsObtained FEOL device piezocoefficients can greatly differ from Smith piezocoefficients for bulk Si. Direct calibration of FEOL devices to stress is necessary. The stress sensitivity of MOSFETs, FinFETs and pseudo-Hall devices was assessed. All of these devices exhibit a sensitivity to mechanical stress. MOSFETs were implemented as stress sensors. An important advantage of MOSFETs is its ability toextract individual stress components. FinFETs exhibited lower sensitivity to stress than MOSFETs. Pseudo-Hall devices exhibit better temperature stability than MOSFETs, but extraction of stress components is not straightforward. Under certain conditions, MOSFETs can be used to extract both in-plane stresses and out-of-plane stress. High MOSFET current shift of above 40 % was observed after 3 D Si die stacking and linked to the underfill-microbump stress mechanism. During cooling of a 3 D IC stack after die bonding, the underfill as the material with the highest coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) in the surrounding, shrinks and pulls the thin Si die over the underlying microbumps causing local warpage of the thin Si die. The underfill microbump stress mechanism is a CTE mismatch driven mechanism initiated by the underfill material. The underfill-microbump interaction was experimentally monitored on 3 generations of 2 -die 3 D stacks. Global and local in-plane and out-of-plane stresses generated after 3 D stacking were extracted with MOSFETs on both die levels. Stress in Si was monitored on the opposite side of the microbumps, directly below the microbump and between microbumps. After 3 D die stacking, on the opposite side of the microbump, tensile in-plane stress components in Si are dominant. Compressive out-of-plane stress becomes dominant on the Si side below the microbump. Cu pads used for creating microbumps leave a non-negligible stress mark in Si as well. N-type and p-type Si and in that sense n-type and p-type MOSFETs have a distinctively different response to mechanical stress. Circular stress patterns are observed in Si as a consequence of the underfill-microbump interaction, which reflect into circular current shift patterns for n-type Si devices and orbital current shift patterns with positive and negative current shift regions for p-type Si devices. Keep-out zones, prohibited areas in Si for processing MOSFETS and other sensitive FEOL devices on IC layouts due to the underfill-microbump stress impact, are proposed. Circular keep-out zones, primarily above the microbump position are proposed for n-type devices. Rectangular keep-out zones around the microbump position, in the surrounding but not directly above the microbump position, are proposed for p-type devices. Underfill-microbump stress mitigation guidelines are proposed based on an experimentally validated finite element model. Increasing die thickness, choosing a lowstress underfill, decreasing the pitch between microbumps, decreasing the microbump height and grouping microbumps in larger arrays all contribute to stress reduction in Si. Based on implementation of some of the guidelines, such as increase of Si thickness and lower microbump pitch, stress decrease in Si is observed through assessed 3 D stack generations, from a starting 827 MPa down to 125 MPa. 3 D stacks were further packaged. Global and local in-plane and out-of-plane stress in Si generated after 3 D stack packaging was extracted with MOSFETs on both die levels. It was revealed that the package substrate has an equally important impact in generating Si stress and package warpage as the mold compound. The final package warpage and Si stress is a result of the interaction of the substrate and mold compound. Packaging exerts different global stress patterns on the two stacked Si dies. Between the microbumps, compressive in-plane stress is observed on the thinned die and tensile in-plane stress is observed on the thicker die. High out-of-plane stress is observed between the microbumps on the thicker Si die. Local sensors revealed that stress patterns in Si from the underfill-microbump reaction remain after packaging andare only modified in absolute value by the interaction of the substrate and mold compound.
