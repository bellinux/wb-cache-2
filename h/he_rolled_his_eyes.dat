500|$|Erin McWhirter of The Daily Telegraph called George's {{character}} [...] "outrageous" [...] {{in response}} to the appendectomy. Former Star-Ledger editor Alan Sepinwall was critical of the character, saying <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> in regard to her letting the interns perform procedures on her, sarcastically writing: [...] "Ooooh, she's damaged! And sexy! She takes off her top and then eagerly cuts herself for the other interns! That's hot!" [...] TV Guide Erin Lulevitch referred to her as a [...] "masochist" [...] due to her self-incision.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> upward {{with a gesture}} of despair.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> ecstatically for a moment, then beamed {{upon them}} with a fatherly air.|$|E
60|$|The Joss doesn't like it. I can see that. Late at night, sometimes, {{he turns}} {{all sorts of}} queer colors--blue and green and red--just {{as he used to}} do when old Fung-Tching was alive; and <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and stamps <b>his</b> feet like a devil.|$|R
6000|$|I {{only meant}} [...] "How-do-you-do?" [...] but <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> big <b>eyes</b> {{sideways}} {{at me in}} his flabby face (it was easier than moving his face) and he answered: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One boat got away--where is it?" [...] asked Mr. Meeson, who, a wet and wretched figure, was huddled {{up in the}} stern-sheets, as <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> wild <b>eyes</b> round {{striving to}} pierce the curtain of the mist.|$|R
60|$|The staring Colonel {{was long}} past minding satire. <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> all round the street.|$|E
60|$|Chandler {{could not}} turn his head, but <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> in the {{direction}} of the speaker.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he's {{no worse}} than the others," [...] {{answered}} Yates, smoothly, and then <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and winked at the other cowboys.|$|E
6000|$|His {{heart was}} cleft {{with pain and}} rage, [...] 640 [...] His cheeks they quivered, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> were wild, [...] Dishonoured thus in his old age; [...] Dishonour'd by his only child, [...] And all his {{hospitality}} [...] To the insulted daughter of his friend [...] 645 [...] By more than woman's jealousy [...] Brought thus to a disgraceful end-- [...] <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> with stern regard [...] Upon the gentle minstrel bard, [...] And said in tones abrupt, austere-- [...] 650 [...] "Why, Bracy! dost thou loiter here? [...] I bade thee hence!" [...] The bard obeyed; [...] And turning from his own sweet maid, [...] The aged knight, Sir Leoline, [...] Led forth the lady Geraldine! [...] 655 ...|$|R
60|$|With creditable ingenuity, old Jake {{set up a}} cackling, high-pitched, {{protracted}} laugh. He {{beat his}} knee, picked up his hat and bent the brim in an apparent paroxysm of humorous appreciation. The seizure afforded him a mask behind which <b>he</b> could <b>roll</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> impartially between, above, and beyond his two tormentors.|$|R
6000|$|Presently {{the street}} {{door opened and}} Platt, {{with an air of}} intense devotion to {{business}} assumed to cover his adoption of that unusual route, came in and made for the staircase down to the warehouse. <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> up <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> at Polly. [...] "Oh Lor!" [...] he said and vanished.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> round heavily, {{but he was}} too {{far gone}} to express surprise. All he could do was to utter one word, [...] "Brandy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The double decker!" [...] said Francis archly. [...] "Why, {{what do you}} mean!--" [...] <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> significantly. [...] "But may I {{introduce}} my friend Angus Guest." ...|$|E
60|$|Lerumie {{was unable}} to answer. <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> helplessly, {{resigned}} to receive a whipping such as he had long since bitterly learned white masters were wont to administer.|$|E
5000|$|Mr Humphries {{also seems}} to be quite put off by Mrs. Slocombe's {{references}} to her [...] "pussy" [...] (to which she means her cat, one of the many double entendres the television show was known for). <b>He</b> often <b>rolls</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> when she mentions stroking the cat or having to dry it out after it was soaking wet.|$|R
6000|$|She {{found herself}} handed {{out of the}} room, with {{somewhat}} curtailed good nights, although nine o'clock, her usual signal, had not yet struck. When {{she came into the}} lamplit hall, Jumbo was grinning and nodding like a maniac, and when she asked what was the matter, <b>he</b> only <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and said, [...] "Missie good! Mas'r like music!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Within the Baron's {{heart and}} brain [...] If thoughts, like these, had any share, [...] They only swelled his rage and pain, [...] And did but work {{confusion}} there. [...] His heart was cleft {{with pain and}} rage, [...] 640 [...] His cheeks they quivered, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> were wild, [...] Dishonoured thus in his old age; [...] Dishonoured by his only child, [...] And all his hospitality [...] To the wronged daughter of his friend [...] 645 [...] By more than woman's jealousy [...] Brought thus to a disgraceful end-- [...] <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> with stern regard [...] Upon the gentle minstrel bard, [...] And said in tones abrupt, austere-- [...] 650 [...] 'Why, Bracy! dost thou loiter here? [...] I bade thee hence!' The bard obeyed; [...] And turning from his own sweet maid, [...] The ag√©d knight, Sir Leoline, [...] Led forth the lady Geraldine! [...] 655 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} Mr. Briggs?" [...] asked the {{straightforward}} Major. <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to every {{quarter of the}} seventh sphere, clapped his hand upon his heart, and assumed an expression of angelic gratitude:-- ...|$|E
60|$|She {{tried to}} {{interrupt}} {{him but he}} went on till she actually clapped {{her hand on his}} mouth. <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> a bit but when she took her hand away he remained silent.|$|E
60|$|The Cast-iron Man gave {{so terrible}} a roar that he even frightened {{the men who}} had made him; and then <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> till they flashed fire, and gnashed his teeth till the noise sounded like thunder.|$|E
60|$|The Joss doesn't get so many sticks burned {{under his}} nose as he used to; that's a sign of ill-luck, as sure as Death. He's all brown, too, {{and no one ever}} attends to him. That's the Memsahib's work, I know; because, when Tsin-ling tried to burn gilt paper before him, she said it was a waste of money, and, if he kept a stick burning very slowly, the Joss wouldn't know the difference. So now we've got the sticks mixed with a lot of glue, and they take half an hour longer to burn, and smell stinky. Let alone the smell of the room by itself. No {{business}} can get on if they try that sort of thing. The Joss doesn't like it. I can see that. Late at night, sometimes, he turns all sorts of queer colors--blue and green and red--just as he used to do when old Fung-Tching was alive; and <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and stamps <b>his</b> feet like a devil.|$|R
60|$|By-and-by {{there was}} a huge noise, and the door opened and in came an ugly troll with a head as big as a bucket. <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> great saucer <b>eyes</b> around till he saw the Prince where he sat beside the fire.|$|R
6000|$|For pure discomfort, {{there are}} few {{things in the world}} that can compete with the final rehearsals of an amateur {{theatrical}} performance at a country-house. Every day, the atmosphere becomes more heavily charged with restlessness and depression. The producer of the piece, especially if he be also the author of it, develops a sort of intermittent insanity. He plucks at his mustache, if he has one: at his hair, if he has not. He mutters to himself. He gives vent to occasional despairing cries. The soothing suavity that marked his demeanor in the earlier rehearsals disappears. He no longer says with a winning smile, [...] "Splendid, old man, splendid. Couldn't be better. But I think we'll take that over just once more, if you don't mind." [...] Instead, <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and snaps out, [...] "Once more, please. This'll never do. At this rate, we might just as well cut out the show altogether. What's that? No, it won't be all right on the night! Now, then, once more; and do pull yourselves together this time." [...] After this, the scene is sulkily resumed; and conversation, when the parties concerned meet subsequently, is cold and strained.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me, Messenger," [...] he added, [...] "how it {{was that}} {{you were able to}} cure me, and who were in the plot to kill me? There must have been more than one," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> round with angry suspicion.|$|E
60|$|Every {{time the}} old rancher saw Wade <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and wagged his head, as if combating superstition with an {{intelligent}} sense of justice. Wade knew what troubled Belllounds, and it strengthened the gloomy mood that, like a poison lichen, seemed finding root.|$|E
60|$|The seaman {{addressed}} {{pulled the}} stroke-oar of the boat, and consequently {{he faced the}} Coquette. Without in the least relaxing his exertions, <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> over the ship, and answered with a steadiness that showed {{him to be a}} man accustomed to situations of hazard.|$|E
50|$|In the rebooted continuity, Fox is notably self-centered, {{as opposed}} to his {{previous}} depiction. He is much less motivated by any desire to resist tyranny, and more by revenge against Andross and money. In Star Fox Adventures he was constantly grumbling about not being paid enough for what he was {{being asked to do}} and made references to only caring about the inevitable pay-off. <b>He</b> frequently <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> or sighed when he found out that he was being asked to do even more work, or when a conversation with a character simply went on too long.|$|R
6000|$|Lord Marmion ill could brook such jest; [...] <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> {{kindling}} <b>eye,</b> With pain <b>his</b> rising wrath suppressed, [...] Yet made a calm reply: [...] "That boy thou thought'st so goodly fair, He {{might not}} brook the Northern air. More of his fate if thou wouldst learn, I left him sick in Lindisfarne: Enough of him. But, Heron, say, Why does thy lovely lady gay Disdain to grace the hall to-day? Or has that dame, so fair and sage, Gone on some pious pilgrimage?" [...] He spoke in covert scorn, for fame Whispered light tales of Heron's dame.|$|R
60|$|The other's {{paroxysm}} had passed, {{and he sat}} up, {{weak and}} fainting, too weak to rise, his forehead dripping, his lips flecked with a foam made yellow by the mustard in which <b>he</b> had <b>rolled.</b> <b>He</b> rubbed <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> with <b>his</b> knuckles, and groans that were like whines came from his throat.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> heavily full on me, and, as I stared, I beheld all {{meaning and}} {{consciousness}} die {{out of the}} swiftly dilating pupils. His figure lost its stark rigidity, softened into the chair, and, chin on chest, hands dropped before him, he rested open-eyed, absolutely still.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a hunter," [...] he said; [...] "I am named 'Eater-up-of-Elephants';" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> looking {{about for}} someone to {{contradict}} him, which nobody did. Indeed, his [...] "praiser," [...] a thin, tired-looking person, whose voice was worn out with his previous exertions, repeated in a feeble way: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{flung the}} length of knotted cord {{to one of the}} negroes, who in an instant made it fast about the prisoner's brows. Then between cord and cranium the black {{inserted}} a short length of metal, round and slender as a pipe-stem. That done <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> towards Levasseur, awaiting the Captain's signal.|$|E
60|$|The Saw-Horse, finding himself alive, {{seemed even}} more {{astonished}} than Tip. <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> knotty <b>eyes</b> {{from side to}} side, taking a first wondering {{view of the world}} in which he had now so important an existence. Then he tried to look at himself; but he had, indeed, no neck to turn; so that in the endeavor to see his body he kept circling around and around, without catching even a glimpse of it. His legs were stiff and awkward, for there were no knee-joints in them; so that presently he bumped against Jack Pumpkinhead and sent that personage tumbling upon the moss that lined the roadside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Porcupine still {{sat with}} his hands clasped over his lean stomach, for {{it took a long}} time for his slow wit to {{understand}} what Sister South Wind meant. 'Bark, bark, try bark,' said Mr. Porcupine over and over to himself. <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> dull little <b>eyes</b> up at the big black birch. 'I believe I will try it,' said Mr. Porcupine at last.|$|R
50|$|He {{continues}} {{to travel with}} them, and while Alejandro becomes more distrustful of Sylar, Maya becomes more trusting of him. After teaching Maya to control her powers, he convinces her that her brother hates her and that in her heart {{she wanted to see}} his wife dead. Convincing her to send Alejandro away, Sylar is eventually confronted by Alejandro. He kills him, but states that he would have let Alejandro go had he not come back. Soon after, Maya confesses her love for Gabriel, and they reach Mohinder's apartment. Sylar attempts to obtain a cure for his condition, later revealed to be the same strain of the Shanti Virus which Niki was infected with. Upon finding that Sylar cannot use any of his obtained abilities, Mohinder attempts to kill Sylar, who then threatens him with a gun. This causes Maya to finally see Sylar's true intentions, so Sylar takes Maya, Mohinder and Molly hostage. Sylar agrees to go to Isaac's loft after Mohinder tells him tests need to be run. At the loft, Molly reveals to Maya that Alejandro is dead, who then goes to confront Sylar. <b>He</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as Maya screams at him, casually turns around and shoots her in the chest, and then tells Mohinder to cure Maya first. Elle enters the building and starts shooting at Sylar, but by then he has seen that the cure works, and he steals it and escapes.|$|R
