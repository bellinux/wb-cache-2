50|$|Modern {{windows are}} usually glazed with one large sheet of glass per sash, while {{windows in the}} past were glazed with {{multiple}} panes separated by <b>glazing</b> <b>bars,</b> or muntins, due to the unavailability of large sheets of glass. Today, <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> tend to be decorative, separating windows into small panes of glass even though larger panes of glass are available, generally in a pattern dictated by the architectural style at use. <b>Glazing</b> <b>bars</b> are typically wooden, but occasionally lead <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> soldered in place are used for more intricate glazing patterns.|$|R
50|$|A {{picture window}} {{is a large}} fixed window in a wall, {{typically}} without <b>glazing</b> <b>bars,</b> or <b>glazed</b> with only perfunctory <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> {{near the edge of}} the window. Picture windows provide an unimpeded view, as if framing a picture.|$|R
50|$|The front {{elevation}} features windows with arched <b>glazing</b> <b>bars,</b> whilst the fanlight {{above the door}} features scalloped <b>glazing</b> <b>bars.</b> The remainder of the windows were originally nine paned in rows of three which pivoted inwards or outwards, however most were replaced with sheet glass or glass louvres in 1983.|$|R
40|$|The high {{strain rate}} (600 s− 1) {{compression}} deformation of a 316 L metallic hollow sphere (MHS) structure (density: 500 kg m− 3; average outer hollow sphere diameter: 2 mm and wall thickness: 45 μm) was determined both numerically and experimentally. The experimental compressive stress–strain behavior at high strain rates until about large strains was obtained with multiple reloading tests using a large-diameter compression type aluminum Split Hopkinson Pressure <b>Bar</b> (SHPB) <b>test</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The multiple reloading of MHS samples in SHPB was analyzed with a 3 D {{finite element model}} using the commercial explicit finite element code LS-DYNA. The tested MHS samples showed increased crushing stress values, when the strain rate increased from quasi-static (0. 8 × 10 − 4 s− 1) to high strain rate (600 s− 1). Experimentally and numerically deformed sections of MHS samples tested showed very similar crushing characteristics; plastic hinge formation, the indentation of the spheres at the contact regions and sphere wall buckling at intermediate strains. The extent of micro-inertial effects was further predicted with the strain rate insensitive cell wall material model and with the strain rate sensitive behavior of MHS structure {{similar to that of}} the cell wall material. Based on the predictions, the strain rate sensitivity of the studied 316 L MHS sample was attributed to the strain rate sensitivity of the cell wall material and the micro-inertia.

2500|$|Bow or bay {{windows were}} the [...] "chief {{architectural}} feature" [...] of Brighton's early houses. Vertical sliding timber-framed sash windows with <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> were usually inserted into these, although casements were sometimes used—typically on the oldest or most modest buildings. [...] Casements would sometimes be given <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> as well. [...] Such bars were usually slim and had mouldings in various patterns. [...] The combination of partly recessed sashes and bow windows {{is characteristic of}} Brighton's Regency-era residential developments. The Queen Anne Revival-style housing popular in Hove in the late 19th century had its own window pattern: two-part sashes with many panes on the upper section, separated by wider <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> than those used in earlier years. Casement windows were popular on interwar Tudor Revival houses, as at Woodland Drive (a conservation area) in West Blatchington; and steel-framed Crittall windows are found in interwar Modernist buildings such as Embassy Court and the Moderne-style mansion flats at 4 Grand Avenue, Hove.|$|R
50|$|It is {{now called}} Dunston Church of England Voluntary Primary Controlled School, Junior Mixed and Infants. The {{building}} is of red brick, the original block, dating from 1866, has lancet windows with diagonal <b>glazing</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
50|$|The manse {{is located}} {{at the corner of the}} black facing Ipswich Street. It is a {{weatherboard}} building on low stumps with a hipped corrugated iron roof. The windows are casements with horizontal <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> and there is a small porch.|$|R
50|$|The north window, as noted, was {{put into}} the {{elevation}} in 1801. The window is of tripartite type comprising a six-over-six sash with narrow margin lights. The <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> are narrow and elegant, consistent with the Regency era within which it was built.|$|R
50|$|The {{windows are}} ornamented by dropped keystones and aprons. In order to {{maintain}} the scale and perspective of the building, the windows are by necessity long and narrow this creates an illusion of greater height — illusion being a typical Baroque feature. The illusion has been somewhat modified, however, by the late 19th century replacement <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> on the first and second floors. The <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> on the ground floor, which are likely to be original, give smaller panes which are more in the English Baroque style as seen at other contemporary baroque buildings, such as Easton Neston. The crowded features of the Baroque façade are not dissimilar to those at Heythrop Park, also in Oxfordshire, where Francis Smith, the architect, worked as building contractor.|$|R
25|$|The cab of {{the crane}} is also of iron, with small-paned windows. These window frames are {{decorated}} with small roses cast into the junctions of the <b>glazing</b> <b>bars.</b> Some time around 1900 the top winding drums and gears were enclosed in a further box on the roof.|$|R

50|$|Glazing: Removed eight full {{stained-glass windows}} for repair in the studio; {{repaired}} 13 other stained and plain glass windows in situ; repaired <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> and repaired window openings; provided fully ventilated external secondary glazing to all windows - {{this was a}} preferred choice to the proposed grills and was cost neutral.|$|R
50|$|The base of {{the tower}} is a square, {{constructed}} at the juncture {{of two of the}} most important avenues in Bogota. The building's facade comprises pilasters of concrete and vertical <b>glazing</b> <b>bars,</b> extending unbroken from ground level to the building's roof. The feature provides ventilation and natural light to offices.|$|R
50|$|A Stained {{glass window}} {{is a window}} {{composed}} of pieces of colored glass, transparent, translucent or opaque, frequently portraying persons or scenes. Typically the glass in these windows is separated by lead <b>glazing</b> <b>bars.</b> Stained glass windows were popular in Victorian houses and some Wrightian houses, and are especially common in churches.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its campaigning and educational roles, the Trust comments on planning applications and takes part in planning policy consultations. It also provides limited financial assistance towards the repair or reinstatement of external architectural features (railings, window <b>glazing</b> <b>bars,</b> urns, gateposts, etc) that may be missing from listed buildings in Bath.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{doors are}} timber with moulded {{panelling}} and operable timber panelled fanlights that retain original brass opening mechanisms. Timber French doors with fanlights have fine, moulded <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> and clear glass lights and open onto the verandah from most rooms. One set of French doors has been modified into one large sliding door and another set has been relocated to enclose the verandah nearby. Other windows are double-hung timber sashes or timber casements with fine, moulded <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> and clear glass. Much {{of the original}} door and window furniture is retained. The house has several built-in storage cupboards with timber shelves. The opening between the foyer and the hall has an arched and battened fanlight. An early bell system survives with buttons in the main bedroom and the drawing room connected to bells in the back hall.|$|R
50|$|Original timber {{doors are}} either {{single-leaf}} or French with rectangular fanlights. The former are low-waisted with four solid panels, {{while the latter}} are low-waisted with single solid panels {{at the bottom and}} two rectangular panes divided by a narrow <b>glazing</b> <b>bar</b> at the top. Some doors appear to have been relocated within the building.|$|R
