5|$|September 26 is World Contraception Day, {{devoted to}} raising {{awareness}} and improving education about sexual and reproductive health, {{with a vision}} of a world where every pregnancy is wanted. It is supported by a group of governments and international NGOs, including the Office of Population Affairs, the Asian Pacific Council on Contraception, Centro Latinamericano Salud y Mujer, the European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health, the German Foundation for World Population, the International Federation of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, <b>International</b> <b>Planned</b> <b>Parenthood</b> <b>Federation,</b> the Marie Stopes International, Population Services International, the Population Council, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and Women Deliver.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war, one pressing problem was the very high number of unwanted pregnancies of rape victims. Estimates of the number of pregnancies resulting in births range from 25,000 to the Bangladeshi government's figure of 70,000, while one publication by the Centre for Reproductive Law and Policy gave a total of 250,000. A government-mandated victim relief programme was set up with the support of the World Health Organization and <b>International</b> <b>Planned</b> <b>Parenthood</b> <b>Federation,</b> among whose goals it was to organise abortion facilities to help rape victims terminate unwanted pregnancies. A doctor at a rehabilitation centre in Dhaka reported 170,000 abortions of pregnancies caused by the rapes, and the births of 30,000 war babies during the first three months of 1972. Dr. Geoffrey Davis, an Australian doctor and abortion specialist who worked for the programme, estimated that there had been about 5,000 cases of self-induced abortions. He also said that during his work he heard of numerous infanticides and suicides by victims. His estimate of the total number of rape victims was 400,000, twice as high as the official estimate of 200,000 cited by the Bangladeshi government. Most of the victims also contracted sexual infections. Many suffered from feelings of intense shame and humiliation, and a number were ostracised by their families and communities or committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|The <b>International</b> <b>Planned</b> <b>Parenthood</b> <b>Federation</b> and the BBC World Service ran a 12-part series {{known as}} , which {{discussed}} sex education, family life education, contraception and parenting. It was first launched in South Asia and then extended worldwide.|$|E

Beginning in 1965, Pilpel was an advisor to the United States Women's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor. She was chair of the Law Panel <b>International</b> of <b>Planned</b> <b>Parenthood</b> <b>Federation</b> from 1970 to 1978. From 1979 to 1986, she served as {{general counsel for the}} American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). She {{served on the}} boards of the Guttmacher Institute, the ACLU, and NARAL. She was also {{co-chair}} of the National Coalition Against Censorship. In the 1950s and 1960s Pilpel also wrote a monthly column for Publishers Weekly entitled [...] "But Can You Do That?"

25|$|The {{oldest and}} largest foreign-funded private {{organization}} with a population control program is the Family Welfare in Brazil (BEMFAM), which is funded by the <b>International</b> <b>Planned</b> <b>Parenthood</b> <b>Federation.</b> Notably, Brazil’s birth rate is well below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the legalization}} of {{contraceptives}} {{in the early twentieth}} century, Brazilian law placed contraception, abortion and immorality in the same classification. Three factors that have impacted contraceptive laws on Brazil are the influence of the Catholic Church, the legacy of Iberian culture, and the historically conservative approach to the status of women in Latin America. Bem-Estar Familiar no Brasil (BEMFAM), which is funded by the <b>International</b> <b>Planned</b> <b>Parenthood</b> <b>Federation,</b> is the leading NGO in the country dedicated to family planning.|$|E
25|$|In the German {{part of the}} country, the {{situation}} is somewhat different. Sex education as a school implemented program is a fairly recent subject, the responsibility given to school teachers. Though federal structures give authority to each State to decide, there are efforts, notably {{under the auspices of}} Santé sexuelle Suisse - the Swiss branch of IPPF (<b>International</b> <b>Planned</b> <b>Parenthood</b> <b>Federation)</b> - to look for and propose possible models of application which take into account all factors of sex education according to their different levels of concern, parents, teachers, and external experts.|$|E

500|$|On July 5, European Parliament {{passed a}} {{resolution}} condemning both the treatment of Feng and forced abortions in general, [...] "especially {{in the context of}} the one-child policy." [...] The resolution also requested that forced abortion be added the agenda for the next bilateral human rights dialogue with China. Additionally, some Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) requested an independent investigation into forced abortion and infanticide in China. A few days later, MEP Lojze Peterle opined that Chinese family planning law violates provisions outlined by the United Nations in the International Conference on Population and Development. [...] He said the resolution passed by parliament gives the European Commission a [...] "clear mandate" [...] to withdraw funds from any organization potentially involved in aiding coercive practices in China, citing the <b>International</b> <b>Planned</b> <b>Parenthood</b> <b>Federation</b> and Marie Stopes International as two potential targets.|$|E
500|$|Birth control {{advocacy}} {{also took}} on a global aspect as organizations around the world began to collaborate. In 1946, Sanger helped found the International Committee on Planned Parenthood, which evolved into the <b>International</b> <b>Planned</b> <b>Parenthood</b> <b>Federation</b> and soon became the world's largest non-governmental international family planning organization. In 1952, John D. Rockefeller III founded the influential Population Council. Fear of global overpopulation became {{a major issue in}} the 1960s, generating concerns about pollution, food shortages, and quality of life, leading to well-funded birth control campaigns around the world. The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development and the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women addressed birth control and influenced human rights declarations which asserted women's rights to control their own bodies.See also: Petchesky, Rosalind Pollack (2001), [...] "Reproductive Politics", in The Oxford Companion to Politics of the World, Joël Krieger, Margaret E.

2500|$|During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, {{numerous}} {{women were}} tortured and raped. Exact numbers {{are not known}} and are a subject of debate. Most {{of the women were}} captured from Dhaka University and private homes and kept as sex-slaves inside the Dhaka Cantonment. Australian Doctor Geoffrey Davis was brought to Bangladesh by the United Nation and <b>International</b> <b>Planned</b> <b>Parenthood</b> <b>Federation</b> to carry out late term abortions on rape victims. He was of the opinion that the 200,000 to 400,000 rape victims was an underestimation. On the actions of Pakistan army he said [...] "They’d keep the infantry back and put artillery ahead and they would shell the hospitals and schools. And that caused absolute chaos in the town. And then the infantry would go in and begin to segregate the women. Apart from little children, all those were sexually matured would be segregated...And then the women would be put in the compound under guard and made available to the troops…Some of the stories they told were appalling.
