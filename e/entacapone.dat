It {{has been used}} to complement levodopa; however, its usefulness is limited by possible complications such as liver damage. A similarly effective drug, <b>entacapone,</b> has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function. Licensed preparations of <b>entacapone</b> contain <b>entacapone</b> alone or in combination with carbidopa and levodopa.|$|E
25|$|Tolcapone {{inhibits}} the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme, which degrades dopamine and levadopa, thereby prolonging {{the therapeutic}} effects of levodopa. It, alongside inhibitors of peripheral dopa decarboxylase, {{have been used}} to complement levodopa. However, due to its possible side effects such as liver failure, it is limited in its availability. A similar drug, <b>entacapone,</b> has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function and maintains adequate inhibition of COMT over time. <b>Entacapone</b> is available for treatment alone (COMTan) or combined with carbidopa and levodopa (Stalevo).|$|E
5000|$|... 10% of {{patients}} taking <b>entacapone</b> {{have been shown}} to experience diarrhea. Diarrhea may occur within 4-12 weeks of initial <b>entacapone</b> use but resolves after discontinuation of the drug. Use of <b>entacapone</b> in the presence of diarrhea can also be associated with weight loss, low potassium levels, and dehydration. In clinical studies, severe diarrhea was the most common reason for discontinuation of <b>entacapone.</b>|$|E

50|$|Biliary {{excretion}} is {{the major}} route of excretion for <b>entacapone.</b> People with liver dysfunction may require additional caution and more frequent liver function monitoring while taking <b>entacapone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 10% {{of people}} taking <b>entacapone</b> {{experience}} {{a change in}} urine color to orange, red, brown, or black. This side effect is due to <b>entacapone</b> metabolism and excretion in the urine and shown to not be harmful.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there have}} been animal studies that showed that <b>entacapone</b> was {{excreted}} into maternal rat milk, {{there have been}} no studies with human breast milk. Caution is advised for mothers taking <b>entacapone</b> while breastfeeding or during pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Entacapone</b> is a {{selective}} and reversible inhibitor of the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). When taken together with levodopa (L-DOPA) and carbidopa, <b>entacapone</b> stops catechol-O-methyltransferase from breaking down and metabolizing levodopa, {{resulting in an}} overall increase of levodopa remaining {{in the brain and}} body.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} with <b>entacapone,</b> another nitrocatechol COMT inhibitor, tolcapone has a longer half life (2.9 hours vs. 0.8 hours) and can better penetrate the blood-brain barrier, acting {{both in the}} central nervous system and in the periphery. However, <b>entacapone</b> is less toxic for the liver.|$|E
5000|$|Potential {{limiting}} conditions to consider before starting <b>entacapone</b> include: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Entacapone</b> {{safety and}} {{efficacy}} have not been assessed in infants or children.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{side effect of}} <b>entacapone</b> is {{movement}} problems, which occur in 25% of people taking <b>entacapone.</b> This drug may cause or worsen dyskinesia for people with Parkinson's disease treated together with levodopa and carbidopa. In particular, [...] "peak-dose dyskinesias" [...] may occur when levodopa levels are at its peak concentration in the serum plasma.|$|E
50|$|Pharmaceutical {{examples}} include <b>entacapone,</b> tolcapone,opicapone and nitecapone. Tolcapone also acts inside the CNS.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{significant}} considerations {{for people with}} poor kidney function taking <b>entacapone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Entacapone</b> is an orally {{active drug}} {{that can be}} taken with or without food.|$|E
50|$|<b>Entacapone,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Comtan among others, is a {{medication}} commonly used {{in combination with other}} medications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. <b>Entacapone</b> together with levodopa and carbidopa allows levodopa to have a longer effect in the brain and reduces Parkinson’s disease signs and symptoms for a greater length of time than levodopa and carbidopa therapy alone.|$|E
50|$|Levodopa is the {{immediate}} precursor to dopamine. <b>Entacapone</b> is a selective, reversible catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor {{that increases the}} bioavailability of levodopa. <b>Entacapone</b> does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Carbidopa is a peripheral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor. Carbidopa, which also does not cross the blood-brain barrier, is combined with levodopa to prevent its conversion to dopamine in the periphery.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{high risk}} for {{allergic}} reactions {{for people who are}} hypersensitive to <b>entacapone.</b>|$|E
50|$|For the {{treatment}} of Parkinson’s disease, <b>entacapone</b> is given {{as an adjunct to}} levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, carbidopa. <b>Entacapone</b> inhibits COMT in the periphery (but not, or at most marginally, in the brain) and the metabolism of levodopa, thus increasing plasma levels of levodopa and causing more constant dopaminergic stimulation {{in order to reduce the}} signs and symptoms presented in the disease.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Entacapone</b> {{is used in}} {{addition}} to levodopa and carbidopa for people with Parkinson's disease to treat the {{signs and symptoms of}} end-of-dose [...] "wearing-off." [...] "Wearing-off" [...] is characterized by the re-appearance of both motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease occurring towards the end of a previous levodopa and carbidopa dose. In clinical trials, <b>entacapone</b> has not been shown to slow progression or reverse Parkinson’s disease.|$|E
5000|$|Levodopa, a {{precursor}} of catecholamines, {{is an important}} substrate of COMT. COMT inhibitors, like <b>entacapone,</b> save levodopa from COMT and prolong the action of levodopa. <b>Entacapone</b> is a widely used adjunct drug of levodopa therapy. When given with an inhibitor of dopa decarboxylase (carbidopa or benserazide), levodopa is optimally saved. This [...] "triple therapy" [...] is becoming a standard {{in the treatment of}} Parkinson's disease.|$|E

50|$|Carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone (Stalevo), a {{medication}} developed by Orion Pharma and marketed by Novartis, {{is a single}} tablet formulation that contains levodopa, carbidopa, and <b>entacapone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Episodes of orthostatic {{hypotension}} {{have been}} shown to be more common at the start of <b>entacapone</b> use due to increased levels of levodopa.|$|E
5000|$|Carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone was {{approved}} by the FDA in June 2003 to treat adults with Parkinson’s disease of unknown cause in two scenarios. First, to substitute with equivalent strength of each of the three components for immediate-release carbidopa/levodopa and <b>entacapone</b> previously administered as individual products. Second, to replace immediate-release carbidopa/levodopa therapy (without <b>entacapone)</b> when people experience the signs and symptoms of end-of-dose [...] "wearing-off" [...] but only for people taking a total daily dose of levodopa of 600 mg or less and not experiencing dyskinesias.|$|E
50|$|Tolcapone has {{demonstrated}} significant liver toxicity (hepatotoxicity) that limits the drug's utility. <b>Entacapone</b> is an alternative, largely {{since it has}} a more favorable toxicity profile.|$|E
50|$|Tolcapone {{inhibits}} the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme, which degrades dopamine and levadopa, thereby prolonging {{the therapeutic}} effects of levodopa. It, alongside inhibitors of peripheral dopa decarboxylase, {{have been used}} to complement levodopa. However, due to its possible side effects such as liver failure, it is limited in its availability. A similar drug, <b>entacapone,</b> has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function and maintains adequate inhibition of COMT over time. <b>Entacapone</b> is available for treatment alone (COMTan) or combined with carbidopa and levodopa (Stalevo).|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of carbidopa/levodopa carries the brand names of Kinson,Sinemet, Pharmacopa and Atamet; while Stalevo {{is a combination}} with <b>entacapone,</b> which enhances the bioavailability of carbidopa and levodopa.|$|E
50|$|The {{volume of}} {{distribution}} (Vd) after intravenous injection is approximately 20 liters. 98% of the circulating <b>entacapone</b> {{is bound to}} serum albumin, which limits its distribution into tissues.|$|E
50|$|COMT inhibitors include tolcapone, <b>entacapone</b> and opicapone, {{which are}} used in the {{treatment}} of Parkinson's disease. Risk of liver toxicity and related digestive disorders restricts the use of tolcapone.|$|E
50|$|People have {{reported}} sudden sleep onset while engaging in daily activities without prior warning of drowsiness. In controlled studies, patients on <b>entacapone</b> had a 2% {{increased risk of}} somnolence compared to placebo.|$|E
50|$|As with <b>entacapone,</b> no {{relevant}} liver toxicity {{has been}} found in studies. This is in contrast to the first COMT inhibitor tolcapone, which could cause - in some cases lethal - liver insufficiency.|$|E
