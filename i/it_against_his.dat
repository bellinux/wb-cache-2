25|$|To ring a handbell, the ringer moves {{it in such}} a {{way that}} the clapper strikes the inside surface of the bell, usually holding <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> or her shoulder, bell upwards, and then {{swinging}} the bell through an elliptical shape to cause the clapper to strike the casting. The tone of the bell will continue to resonate, decaying naturally until it stops completely or the ringer stops it by damping the bell with a hand or on the body or a padded surface.|$|E
25|$|Blue Horse’s {{twin brother}} Big Mouth was the elder and became head chief in 1864 upon {{the death of}} Old Chief Smoke. Big Mouth opposed Spotted Tail’s {{leadership}} and criticized his negotiations with Washington politicians. On October 29, 1869, Spotted Tail called {{at the door of}} Big Mouth’s lodge, and asked to speak with him. On his appearance, he was seized by two warriors, who held him fast, while Spotted Tail drew a pistol, placed <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> body, and shot Big Mouth dead.|$|E
500|$|Too Much Too Soon {{was titled}} after the {{biography}} {{of the same name}} on actress Diana Barrymore. According to music journalist Jon Savage, the title was [...] "more than applicable to the Dolls themselves" [...] because of alcoholism and other issues among the band members, including Thunders's heroin use and Nolan's contraction of hepatitis. A dedication to Barrymore was printed in the album's gatefold LP. For its front cover, the group eschewed the drag image that their first album had presented and they had developed a reputation for in favor of a fake concert shot. During the shoot, Thunders held a doll in his arm as if to strike <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> guitar to add shock value.|$|E
50|$|He is {{paired with}} Kagetsuya, a {{handsome}} and popular white-winged angel who hates mankind and holds hostility for Lucifers. Due to this prejudice, Kagetsuya is extremely hostile towards Chihaya at first, constantly belittling {{him because of}} his feelings and appearance. Despite all this, Kagetsuya often finds himself carried away with Chihaya's ideals and constantly aiding him, though <b>it's</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> position.|$|R
50|$|Mainwaring {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from Elizabeth, asking him to get her some off-ration ox tail for him. He tries to explain <b>it's</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> principles, but Elizabeth refuses to listen. Mainwaring calls Jones into the office to ask him about the ox tail, and his wife's craving for it, but crossed wires result in Jones believing he will help to deliver Elizabeth's child.|$|R
50|$|Girls & Sports {{deals with}} the dating lives of two men, Bradley and Marshall. Bradley is dating Joann but is not against going {{to the bar and}} hitting on other women, though he remains loyal to Joann (as far as she knows). Marshall is the {{perpetual}} single guy who listens to Bradley's advice even when <b>it's</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> better judgment. Joann thinks Marshall is a bad influence on Bradley.|$|R
500|$|Among {{the issues}} confronting the Senate was the surplus of {{government}} funds. With high revenue held over from wartime taxes, {{the federal government}} had collected more than it spent since 1866; by 1882 the surplus reached $145 million. Opinions varied on how to balance the budget; the Democrats wished to lower tariffs, in order to reduce revenues and the cost of imported goods, while Republicans believed that high tariffs ensured high wages in manufacturing and mining. They preferred the government spend more on internal improvements and pensions for Civil War soldiers while reducing excise taxes. [...] Bayard did not oppose some veterans' pensions, but worried that pensions would require continued high tariffs, which he opposed. [...] He supported the movement for a commission to examine the tariff and suggest improvements, but opposed the resulting Tariff of 1883, which reduced tariffs by an average of 1.47%. [...] Congressional Republicans also sought to deplete the surplus through a Rivers and Harbors Act that increased spending on internal improvements; Bayard opposed the bill and was gratified when Arthur vetoed <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> own party's wishes.|$|E
500|$|During {{a typical}} Polish {{coronation}} ceremony {{in the times}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the king-elect received Szczerbiec after his anointment and before being crowned and enthroned. The primate of Poland, that is the archbishop of Gniezno, picked up the unsheathed sword from the altar {{and handed it to}} the kneeling king. At the same time, he recited a formula which asked the monarch to use the sword to rule justly, defend the Church, fight evil, protect widows and orphans, and to [...] "rebuild what is damaged, maintain what is rebuilt, avenge what is unjust, reinforce what is well managed," [...] etc. Then, the king handed the sword to the Crown sword-bearer (miecznik koronny), who slid it into the scabbard and passed on to the primate. The primate, aided by the Crown and Lithuanian sword-bearers, fastened the scabbard to the king's belt. The king stood up and, facing onlookers, withdrew Szczerbiec, made three times {{the sign of the cross}} with it, and wiped <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> left arm before replacing it in the scabbard. The king's sword-wielding abilities were closely watched by his new subjects during this part of the ritual. When Augustus III betrayed his poor fencing skills at his coronation, nobles joked that they were going to have [...] "a peaceful lord". After Szczerbiec, a bishop handed the sovereign the Grunwald Swords symbolizing the monarch's reign over the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth.|$|E
2500|$|Tinsley was an unorthodox businessman, often working without formal agreements; {{and what}} he saw as fair dealing might come across as sharp {{practice}} to those who lost by it. But he could also be generous and had a genuine enthusiasm for literature. [...] His greatest passion was the theatre and his sometimes naive admiration led him to publish material from those involved in <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> own interest.|$|E

2500|$|Intentionalists {{hold that}} the Holocaust {{was the result}} of a {{long-term}} masterplan on the part of Hitler, and that he was the driving force behind it. Functionalists hold that Hitler was antisemitic, but that he did not have a masterplan for genocide. They see the Holocaust as coming from the ranks of the German bureaucracy, with little or no involvement on the part of Hitler. Within the content of Hitler biographies written by Joachim Fest and Alan Bullock, one encounters a [...] "Hitler-centric explanation of genocide" [...] even though other psycho-historians like Rudolph Binion, Walter Langer, and Robert Waite raised issues about Hitler's ability to make rational decisions; his anti-Semitism remained nonetheless unquestioned, the latter authors merely juxtaposed <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> general mental health.|$|E
2500|$|.....while talking or even musing {{as he sat}} in his chair, he {{commonly}} held {{his head to one side}} towards his right shoulder, and shook it in a tremulous manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his mouth; sometimes giving a half whistle, sometimes making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking like a hen, and sometimes protruding <b>it</b> <b>against</b> <b>his</b> upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly under his breath, 'Too, too, too.' All this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, in the course of a dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale.|$|E
