40|$|Although many view {{iterative}} and {{incremental development}} as a modern practice, its application dates {{as far back as}} the mid- 1950 s. Prominent software-engineering thought leaders from each succeeding decade supported IID practices, and many large projects used them successfully. As agile methods become more popular, some view iterative, evolutionary, and incremental software development—a cornerstone of these methods—as the “modern ” replacement of the waterfall model, but its practiced and published roots go back decades. Of course, many software-engineering students are aware of this, yet surprisingly, some commercial and government organizations still are not.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an extracurricular program called INSPIRE 3 {{that has been}} implemented by the ETSEIAT (Escola Tècnica Superior d’Enginyeries Industrial i Aeronàutica de Terrassa), a center belonging to the UPC-BarcelonaTech (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya). This program is mainly aimed at facilitating cross-curricular skills and developing abilities among students through collaborative-project based learning. The projection of an attractive external image of engineering degrees offered by ETSEIAT {{in order to increase}} the enrollment in such degrees is a secondary goal of this program. Under INSPIRE 3, several real, challenging and multidisciplinary engineering projects are currently under development. The main feature of this program is that the subjects of the projects are proposed by the students themselves. In this paper, INSPIRE 3 motivation, program management and implementation process are described and a short <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> under development is also given.
