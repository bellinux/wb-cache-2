5|$|The {{media has}} {{historically}} come under {{varying degrees of}} pressure over time to censor their criticism of the government. Reporters are occasionally threatened or harassed and media outlets are periodically forced to close. Accusations of media censorship have increased since 2009 due to the alleged intensification of restrictions on political criticism. Access to the internet has grown <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> past decade, with an estimated 352,000 residents of Madagascar accessing the internet from home or {{in one of the}} nation's many internet cafés in December 2011.|$|E
5|$|Lara's backstory {{has changed}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{course of the}} series. During the first era, game manuals {{describe}} the character as the Wimbledon, London-born daughter of Lord Henshingly Croft (Lord Richard Croft in Legend and its sequels). She was raised as an aristocrat and betrothed to the fictitious Earl of Farringdon. Lara attended the Scottish boarding school Gordonstoun and a Swiss finishing school. At the age of twenty-one, she survived a plane crash, which left her stranded in the Himalayas for two weeks; the experience spurred her to shun her former life and seek other adventures around the world. Croft published books and other written works based on her exploits as a mercenary, big-game hunter, and master thief.|$|E

5|$|Physiologists such as Claude Bernard {{explored}} (through vivisection {{and other}} experimental methods) {{the chemical and}} physical functions of living bodies to an unprecedented degree, {{laying the groundwork for}} endocrinology (a field that developed quickly after the discovery of the first hormone, secretin, in 1902), biomechanics, and the study of nutrition and digestion. The importance and diversity of experimental physiology methods, within both medicine and biology, grew <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> second half of the 19th century. The control and manipulation of life processes became a central concern, and experiment was placed at the center of biological education.|$|E
25|$|The {{control of}} {{turbocharger}} boost has changed <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> 100-plus {{years of their}} use. Modern turbochargers can use wastegates, blow-off valves and variable geometry, as discussed in later sections.|$|E
25|$|Coburn and McCain {{noted that}} the {{practice}} of members of Congress adding earmarks has risen <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years, from 121 earmarks in 1987 to 15,268 earmarks in 2005, according to the Congressional Research Service.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the details}} of local {{administration}} have changed <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> time, <b>the</b> basic outline of the current three-tiered system was implemented under the reign of Gojong in 1895. A similar system also remains in use in North Korea.|$|R
50|$|Agriculture in Dilhorne still plays a {{large part}} in the village, {{but the number of}} farms and workers has <b>dramatically</b> {{decreased}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years. The main concern of agriculture around the Dilhorne area is dairy farming.|$|R
50|$|The {{delinquency}} rate on jumbo loans rose <b>dramatically,</b> tripling <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{course of}} 2009, and by February 2010, almost {{one in ten}} jumbo mortgages were 'seriously delinquent' (i.e. in arrears by at least 60 days).|$|R
25|$|While the {{offshore}} wind industry has grown <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last several decades, especially in Europe, {{there is still}} a great deal of uncertainty associated with how the construction and operation of these wind farms affect marine animals and the marine environment.|$|E
25|$|Sums {{allocated}} for prisoner health, hygiene and nutrition declined <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years. Food rations were {{kept to a}} minimum, and prisoners would often resort to hunting mice and other small animals, or even consuming grass {{in an attempt to}} supplement their diet.|$|E
25|$|Canada {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{agricultural}} producers and exporters in the world.

40|$|China's urban {{geography}} has been <b>dramatically</b> altered <b>over</b> <b>the</b> past three decades.

25|$|Aquaculture, an {{industry}} that has emerged only in recent decades, {{has become one of the}} fastest growing sectors of the world food economy.

25|$|While {{the number}} of Non-governmental Organization have {{increased}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> past few decades, fragmentation in aid policy is an issue. Because of such fragmentation, health workers in several African countries, for example, say they are so busy meeting western delegates that they can only do their proper jobs in the evening.|$|E
25|$|War and {{colonisation}} {{during the}} 16th and 17th centuries brought Ireland securely under English control. However, {{this was at}} a cost of great resentment over land ownership and inequitable laws. This resulted in Gaelic ties between Scotland and Ireland withering <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of the 17th century, including a divergence in the Gaelic language into two distinct languages.|$|E
30|$|The {{number of}} new cases has <b>dramatically</b> {{increased}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> past years because of the better recognition of this condition. The natural evolution is variable but the spontaneous prognosis is severe. A good knowledge of its specific imaging features seems to be crucial for early management and improved prognosis.|$|R
50|$|This area of Notting Hill's {{northern}} corner {{has changed}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> its history. <b>The</b> area {{was part of}} the Great Forest of Middlesex; in 1543 the land was seized by Henry VIII and by the 18th century Golborne was farmland.|$|R

25|$|Eyemouth is not {{far from}} the small villages of Ayton, Reston, St. Abbs, Coldingham and Burnmouth. The coast offers {{opportunities}} for birdwatching, walking, fishing and diving. Accommodation includes several hotels, B and a holiday park. The geology of the area shows evidence of folding that led James Hutton to announce that {{the surface of the earth}} had changed <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ages.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} how dances {{were to be}} {{executed}} changed <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years. For instance, doing an early-20th-century-style Sword Dance in a competition today would get a dancer disqualified nearly immediately. There used to be terrible confusion as to what would be allowed (or prescribed) where, until the SOBHD {{came up with a}} standard that has become acceptable to the majority of competitive dancers.|$|E
25|$|Volkswagens {{were first}} {{exhibited}} {{and sold in}} the United States in 1949, but sold only two units in America that first year. On entry to the U.S. market, the VW was briefly sold as a Victory Wagon. Volkswagen of America was formed in April 1955 to standardise sales and service in the United States. Production of the Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle increased <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years, the total reaching one million in 1955.|$|E

50|$|Historians' {{interpretations of}} the Radical Republicans have <b>dramatically</b> shifted <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years, from the pre-1950 view of them as tools of big {{business}} motivated by partisanship and hatred of the white South, to {{the perspective of the}} neoabolitionists of the 1950s and afterwards, who applauded their efforts to give equal rights to the freed slaves.|$|R
25|$|Computational {{capacity}} {{has increased}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last decade making possible {{the use of}} more sophisticated and computationally intensive methods in computer-assisted drug design. However, dealing with receptor flexibility in docking methodologies is still a thorny issue. The main reason behind this difficulty is {{the large number of}} degrees of freedom that have to be considered in this kind of calculations. Neglecting it, however, leads to poor docking results in terms of binding pose prediction.|$|E
25|$|Cannabis use has {{increased}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{past few decades}} whereas the rate of psychosis has not increased. Together, {{these findings suggest that}} cannabis use may hasten the onset of psychosis in those who may already be predisposed to psychosis. High-potency cannabis use indeed seems to accelerate the onset of psychosis in predisposed patients. A 2012 study concluded that cannabis {{plays an important role in}} the development of psychosis in vulnerable individuals, and that cannabis use in early adolescence should be discouraged.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{editions of}} Aderca's works saw print after the 1989 Revolution: Femeia cu carne albă, Zeul iubirii and Revolte, {{as well as}} a 2003 Editura Hasefer reprint of Mărturia unei generații. Also issued were his full {{biography}} of Peter the Great and the Oameni excepționali collection. His life and work were the object of several monographs, several of which were authored and published by Zalis. Still, interest in his work declined <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> following period, although some disciples of his, including the poet and translator Petre Solomon, were still active.|$|E
