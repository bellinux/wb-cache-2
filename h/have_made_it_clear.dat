By this time political events <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that the settler and indigenous strands are inextricably bound in a sense of nationhood independent of Britain. Acceptance of local English(es) expresses this new identity. National dictionaries are enthusiastically supported, at least for new lexis (and not always for localized grammar). Literary creativity in local English begins to flourish.|$|E

25|$|Scientific {{publications}} <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> {{since the}} 1980s {{that the majority}} of researchers do believe animals suffer and feel pain, though it continues to be argued that their suffering may be reduced by an inability to experience the same dread of anticipation as humans, or to remember the suffering as vividly. The problem of animal suffering, and animal consciousness in general, arose primarily because it was argued that animals have no language. Singer writes that, if language were needed to communicate pain, it would often be impossible to know when humans are in pain, though we can observe pain behavior and make a calculated guess based on it. He argues that {{there is no reason to}} suppose that the pain behavior of nonhumans would have a different meaning from the pain behavior of humans.|$|E

The Massacre at Huế came under increasing press scrutiny later, when press reports exposed that South Vietnamese [...] "revenge squads" [...] had also been at work {{in the aftermath of the}} battle, searching out and executing citizens that had supported the communist occupation. According to Vietnam historian Stanley Karnow, [...] "Balanced accounts <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear,</b> however, that the Communist butchery at Hue did take place—perhaps on an even larger scale than reported during the war." ...|$|E

[...] The Foreign Ministry issued a statement dismissing the OIC’s criticism and accusing it of disseminating misperceptions and misinformation about the situation in the southern provinces. [...] "If the OIC secretariat really wants to promote the cause of peace and harmony in the three southern provinces of Thailand, the responsibility falls on the OIC secretariat to strongly condemn the militants, who are perpetrating these acts of violence against both Thai Muslims and Thai Buddhists."

2500|$|Insisting {{that all}} mothers had {{something}} to say and a right to act, Barrett also successfully led large numbers of women to push the boundaries of what was acceptable for women to pursue. Historian Katherine Aiken finds Barrett’s current relatively small profile illuminating. [...] "One of the most prominent women of her time, Kate Waller Barrett is today a virtually unknown historical character." [...] Aiken notes that popular culture and historians have focused on female activists and social scientists [...] "who tended to be single, career women. Certainly, as a physician and trained nurse, Barrett's professional status was on par with any progressive reformer, male or female. However, unlike many of her contemporaries, Barrett relied on her role as wife and mother to establish her credentials.... Recent studies of maternalism <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that middle-class women often used the rhetoric of motherhood to make inroads toward achieving changes favorable to women. Barrett and the NFCM illustrate this phenomenon".|$|E

He depicted Gallagher's attitude as [...] "an outbreak of resentments", and indicated that [...] "the only praise I could offer [...] " [...] was in regard to the latter's respect for pluralism in front of authoritarianism. In later statements on the issue, he argued that Gallagher concerns about a supposed change in political views had been unfounded, while expressing regret over the fact that [...] "I had not highlighted [...] in those sections I authored, certain elements that would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> for the reader where I stand". Elsewhere, he responded to claims made about his contacts with Becali by admitting that the visit was inappropriate. Cristian Vasile, who notes that concerns similar to those of Gallagher were expressed by historian Șerban Papacostea and by himself, argues that Tismăneanu effectively dissuaded fears of a [...] "moral resignation" [...] by not accepting any form of [...] "privilege or public post" [...] from the political sides he was alleged to favor.|$|E
