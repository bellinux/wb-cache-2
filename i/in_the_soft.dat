Though some projectiles buried themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> soil, most found their marks on the reverse slope of the ridge.

5|$|The present {{geography}} of the Gulf Coast was formed during an ice age approximately 30,000 years ago when dramatic lowering of the sea level occurred.

5|$|As they hovered {{above the}} target, however, the first {{helicopter}} experienced a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} vortex ring state. This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature ("a so-called 'hot and high' environment") and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor downwash from diffusing. The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside. The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E
5|$|Footprints {{from the}} Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when Currie and colleagues {{described}} several {{examples from the}} Nemegt locality. Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids (probably Saurolophus), while two have been left by a large theropod (probably Tarbosaurus) and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia, which showed a matching hind foot morphology. The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym, making it unlikely that the tracks were left by another, similar titanosaur. The tracks were left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand. Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{widening}} the existing structure, the Minister for Transport, Eric Charlton, on 15 July 1998 approved {{the construction of}} a separate second road bridge alongside the original Narrows Bridge; this solution would cost $15 million less, due to new building techniques, and would be less disruptive to traffic on the existing bridge. The construction of a separate bridge was also deemed necessary because the foundations of any new structure might settle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> river bed at a different rate to the existing bridge. Under the plan, there would be six lanes on each bridge, including a bus lane on each. The new bridge would run parallel to the original bridge and be separated from it by a gap of , and was designed to look largely the same as the original.|$|E

5|$|Many {{anthozoans}} are {{colonial and}} consist of multiple polyps {{with a common}} origin joined together by living material. The simplest arrangement is where a stolon runs along the substrate in a two dimensional lattice with polyps budding off at intervals. Alternatively, polyps may bud off from a sheet of living tissue, the coenosarc, which joins the polyps and anchors the colony to the substrate. The coenosarc may consist of a thin membrane from which the polyps project, as in most stony corals, or a thick fleshy mass in which the polyps are immersed apart from their oral discs, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> corals.|$|E
5|$|A general {{principle}} concerning dental abscesses is ubi pus, ibi evacua ("{{where there is}} pus, drain it"), which applies to any case {{where there is a}} collection of pus in the tissues (such as a periodontal abscess, pericoronal abscess, or apical abscess). The pus within the abscess is under pressure, and the surrounding tissues are deformed and stretched to accommodate the swelling. This leads to a sensation of throbbing (often in time with the pulse) and constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be performed via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeeds, or they are impossible, incision and drainage may be required, in which a small incision is made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> tissues directly over the abscess at the most dependent point. A surgical instrument such as a pair of tweezers is gently inserted into the incision and opened, while the abscess is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is immediate and marked as the built up pressure is relieved. If the pus drains into the mouth, there is usually a bad or offensive taste.|$|E
5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E

25|$|X-rays {{interact}} with matter in three main ways, through photoabsorption, Compton scattering, and Rayleigh scattering. The strength of these interactions {{depends on the}} energy of the X-rays and the elemental composition of the material, but not much on chemical properties, since the X-ray photon energy is much higher than chemical binding energies. Photoabsorption or photoelectric absorption is the dominant interaction mechanism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> X-ray regime and for the lower hard X-ray energies. At higher energies, Compton scattering dominates.|$|E
25|$|Caesium-137 {{is also a}} {{particular}} threat because it behaves like potassium and is taken up by cells throughout the body. Additionally, it has a long, 30-year half-life. Cs-137 can cause acute radiation sickness, and increase the risk for cancer because of exposure to high-energy gamma radiation. Internal exposure to Cs-137, through ingestion or inhalation, allows the radioactive material to be distributed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> tissues, especially muscle tissue, exposing these tissues to the beta particles and gamma radiation and increasing cancer risk. Prussian blue helps the body excrete caesium-137.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} on the invertebrates of the seabed of the Irish Sea is rather patchy because {{it is difficult to}} survey such a large area, where underwater visibility is often poor and information often depends upon looking at material brought up from the seabed in mechanical grabs.
