The Poisson’s ratio {{of both the}} wheel and rail materials is ν =  0.3. The contact angle is δ =  2.5 °. The vertical force applied on the wheel is w =  75, 000  N. The wheel is 840  mm in nominal diameter. The rail is the 60  kg/m type, and 46, 000  mm in length. The <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>sleepers</b> is 600  mm. The width of sleepers is 160  mm. The coefficient of friction between wheel and rail is μ =  0.4. In the present work, the lateral spring stiffness value K_RL of the rail fastener between the rail and each sleeper {{is assumed to be}} a half of the vertical spring stiffness value K_RV; specifically K_RV =  5.0  ×  107  N/m, and K_RL =  2.5  ×  107  N/m. The vertical and lateral damping coefficients of each rail fastener are C_RV =  5, 000  Ns/m and C_RL =  5, 200  Ns/m, respectively. The vertical and lateral spring stiffness values between each sleeper and the monolithic track bed are K SV =  8.9  ×  107  N/m and K SL =  5.0  ×  107  N/m, respectively. The vertical and lateral damping values between each sleeper and the monolithic track bed are C SV =  8.98  ×  104  Ns/m and C SL =  4.0  ×  104  Ns/m, respectively.|$|E

It can both enhance {{the efficiency of}} the heat transfer and reduce the pressure drop. Through the experimental study, under the same shell side flow, the heat transfer coefficient K which the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> flower baffles is 134 mm is higher 3 %~ 9 % than the one of which the <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> flower baffles are 163 mm, 123 mm. The heat transfer coefficient K which the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> flower baffles is 147 mm is close to the one of which the <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> flower baffles is 134 mm. The shell volume flow V is higher, the incremental quantity of heat transfer coefficient K is more. The integrated performance K/∆p of flower baffle heat exchanger which the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> flower baffles is 134 mm is higher 3 %~ 9 % than the one of which the <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> flower baffles are 163 mm, 123 mm.

40|$|We discuss two {{versions}} of the Fréchet distance problem in weighted planar subdivisions. In the first one, the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> points is the weighted length of the line segment joining the points. In the second one, the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> points is the length of the shortest path between the points. In both cases, we give algorithms for finding a (1 +epsilon) -factor approximation of the Fréchet <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> polygonal curves. We also consider the Fréchet <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> polygonal curves among polyhedral obstacles in R^ 3 and present a (1 +epsilon) -factor approximation algorithm.

40|$|Let T be a {{triangulation}} of {{a simple}} polygon. A flip in T is the operation of removing one diagonal of T and adding a different one such that the resulting graph is again a triangulation. The flip <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> triangulations is the smallest number of flips required to transform one triangulation into the other. For the special case of convex polygons, the problem of determining the shortest flip <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> triangulations is equivalent to determining the rotation <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> binary trees, a central problem which is still open after over 25 years of intensive study. We show that computing the flip <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> triangulations {{of a simple}} polygon is NP-complete. This complements a recent result that shows APX-hardness of determining the flip <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> triangulations of a planar point set. ...|$|R
