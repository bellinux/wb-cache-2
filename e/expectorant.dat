30|$|<b>Expectorants</b> {{are thought}} to {{increase}} the hydration of sputum either by the direct addition of water or by stimulation of water secretion into the airway [44]. <b>Expectorants</b> do not directly improve mucociliary clearance. The <b>expectorants</b> include water, guaifenesin, and the iodide containing medications. Despite widespread use of these agents, there are no well-controlled clinical trials that support their use, while randomized controlled trials have generally shown these medications to be ineffective [45 – 47].|$|R

25|$|Nasturtiums {{have been}} used in herbal {{medicine}} for their antiseptic and <b>expectorant</b> qualities. They are said to be good for chest colds and to promote the formation of new blood cells. T. majus has been used in herbal medicine for respiratory and urinary tract infections.|$|E
25|$|Culturing fungi from sputum is a {{supportive}} {{test in the}} diagnosis of ABPA, but is not 100% specific for ABPA as A. fumigatus is ubiquitous and commonly isolated from lung <b>expectorant</b> in other diseases.

25|$|In a 1994 report {{released}} by five top cigarette companies, cysteine {{is one of}} the 599 additives to cigarettes. Like most cigarette additives, however, its use or purpose is unknown. Its inclusion in cigarettes could offer two benefits: acting as an <b>expectorant,</b> since smoking increases mucus production in the lungs; or increasing the beneficial antioxidant glutathione (which is diminished in smokers).|$|E
25|$|In {{a modern}} botanical context, manna {{is often used}} to refer to the {{secretions}} of various plants, especially of certain shrubs and trees, and in particular the sugars obtained by evaporating the sap of the manna ash, extracted by making small cuts in the bark. The manna ash, native to southern Europe and southwest Asia, produces a blue-green sap, which has medicinal value as a mild laxative, demulcent, and weak <b>expectorant.</b>|$|E
25|$|Camphor was a {{component}} of paregoric, an opium/camphor tincture developed in the 18th century. Paregoric was used in various formulations for hundreds of years. It was a household remedy in the 18th and 19th centuries when it was widely used to control diarrhea in adults and children, as an <b>expectorant</b> and cough medicine, to calm fretful children, and to rub on the gums to counteract the pain from teething. Its use declined in the 20th century after the regulation of opium.|$|E

25|$|Misuse of multi-symptom cold medications, {{rather than}} using a cough {{suppressant}} whose sole active ingredient is dextromethorphan, carries significant risk of fatality or serious illness. Multi-symptom cold medicines contain other active ingredients, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), chlorpheniramine, and phenylephrine, any of which can cause permanent bodily damage such as kidney failure, or even death, if taken on the generally accepted recreational dosing scale of dextromethorphan. Sorbitol, an artificial sweetener found in many cough syrups containing dextromethorphan, can also have negative side effects including diarrhea and nausea when taken at recreational dosages of dextromethorphan. Guaifenesin, an <b>expectorant</b> commonly accompanying dextromethorphan in cough preparations, can cause unpleasant symptoms including vomiting, nausea, kidney stones, and headache.|$|E
500|$|Dioscorides first {{recommended}} the plant 2000 years ago, against pulmonary diseases, {{and this has}} remained one of its primary uses, especially against cough. Leaf decoctions or herbal teas were used for expectoration, consumption, dry cough, bronchitis, sore throat and hemorrhoids. Leaves were also smoked against pulmonary ailments, a tradition that in America was rapidly transmitted to Native American [...] peoples. The Zuni people, however, use the plant in poultices of powdered root applied to sores, rashes and skin infections. An infusion of the root {{is also used to}} treat athlete's foot. [...] The combination of <b>expectorant</b> saponins and emollient mucilage makes the plant particularly effective for cough. All preparations meant to be drunk have to be finely filtered to eliminate the irritating hairs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two main}} kinds {{recognized}} in industry are coal-tar creosote and [...] wood-tar creosote. The coal-tar variety, having {{stronger and more}} toxic properties, has chiefly {{been used as a}} preservative for wood; coal-tar creosote was also formerly used as an escharotic, to burn malignant skin tissue, and in dentistry, to prevent necrosis, before its carcinogenic properties became known. The wood-tar variety has been used for meat preservation, ship treatment, and such medical purposes as an anaesthetic, antiseptic, astringent, <b>expectorant,</b> and laxative, though these have mostly been replaced by modern formulations.|$|E

50|$|The {{treatment}} for cor pulmonale can include the following: antibiotics, <b>expectorants,</b> oxygen therapy, diuretics, digitalis, vasodilators, and anticoagulants.

2500|$|A {{saturated}} solution of KI (SSKI) is typically given orally in adult doses {{several times a}} day (5 drops of SSKI assumed to be mL) for thyroid blockade (to prevent the thyroid from excreting thyroid hormone) and occasionally this dose is also used, when iodide is used as an <b>expectorant</b> (the total dose is about one gram KI per day for an adult). The anti-radioiodine doses used for [...] uptake blockade are lower, and range downward from 100 mg a day for an adult, to less than this for children (see table). All of these doses should be compared with the far lower dose of iodine needed in normal nutrition, which is only 150μg per day (150 micrograms, not milligrams).|$|E
60|$|My {{father was}} a north-country surgeon. He had retired, a widower, from her Majesty's navy many years before, and had a small {{practice}} in his native village. When I {{was seven years old}} he employed me to carry medicines to his patients. Being of a lively disposition, I sometimes amused myself, during my daily rounds, by mixing the contents of the different phials. Although I had no reason to doubt that the general result of this practice was beneficial, yet, as the death of a consumptive curate followed the addition of a strong mercurial lotion to his <b>expectorant,</b> my father concluded to withdraw me from the profession and send me to school.|$|E
