5|$|The comb-line filter {{is similar}} to the {{interdigital}} filter in that it lends itself to mechanical assembly in a metal case without dielectric support. In the case of the comb-line, all the lines are short-circuited at the same end rather than alternate ends. The other ends are terminated in capacitors to ground, and the design is consequently classified as semi-lumped. The chief advantage of this design is that the upper stopband can be made very wide, that <b>is,</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> spurious passbands at all frequencies of interest.|$|E
5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume that the world <b>is</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, {{as well as the}} attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E

Entrance to the galleries <b>is</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> charge. Notable exhibitions have included works by Bridget Riley, Richard Long, Rachel Whiteread, Paul McCartney, Angus Fairhurst and Louise Bourgeois. Regular events include poetry and film festivals, live art and dance performances, lectures and jazz and experimental music concerts, including Bodies in Flight, Goat Island Performance Group, Akram Khan, the London Sinfonietta, the Philip Glass Ensemble, Random Dance, and Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company.|$|E

5|$|The island's {{geography}} comprises relatively low-lying mountains {{surrounding a}} central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. The island has lush vegetation, {{a product of}} its mild but changeable climate which <b>is</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> extremes in temperature. Thick woodlands covered the island until the Middle Ages. As of 2013, the amount of land that is wooded in Ireland is about 11% of the total, compared with a European average of 35%. There are twenty-six extant mammal species native to Ireland. The Irish climate is very moderate and classified as oceanic. As a result, winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area. However, summers are cooler than those in Continental Europe. Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the first seven years of primary education, students can continue their studies in lower secondary education in the 8th and 9th grade and if they wish to, they can also take the 10th year of Fólkaskúli. Two thirds of the pupils from the 9th grade chose to take the 10th grade of Fólkaskúlin also. Lower secondary education lasts {{two to three years}} and, as with primary education, it is provided by Fólkaskúli and <b>is</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> charge. The first two years are part of the compulsory education, while the third year is optional, though a prerequisite to continue to the upper high school. In 2014 there were 1,932 students in lower secondary education.|$|E
5|$|When Joan {{comes to}} speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to be a common member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able {{to see through the}} ruse and {{immediately}} proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she <b>is</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came to her with visions and describes her faith in a similar manner to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along with a sound, which is enough to silence any doubts about her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts her immediate donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed and that she would be a victim. The individual, as it turns out, is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.|$|E

5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and <b>is</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E
5|$|Once {{they reach}} Zanarkand, Yunalesca—the first summoner to defeat Sin and unsent ever since—tells {{the group that}} the Final Aeon is created from the fayth of one close to the summoner. After {{defeating}} Sin, the Final Aeon kills the summoner and transforms into a new Sin, which has caused its cycle of rebirth to continue. Yuna decides against using the Final Aeon, due to the futile sacrifices it carries {{and the fact that}} Sin would still be reborn. Disappointed by their resolution, Yunalesca tries to kill Tidus' group, but she is defeated and vanishes, ending hope of ever attaining the Final Aeon. After the fight, the group learns that Yu Yevon, a summoner who lost his humanity and mind, is behind Sin's cycle of rebirth. This leads the group to infiltrate Sin's body to battle Seymour, and Jecht's imprisoned spirit. With Sin's host defeated, Tidus' group battles and defeats Yu Yevon. Sin's cycle of rebirth ends, and the spirits of Spira's fayth are freed from their imprisonment. Auron, who had earlier been revealed to be unsent, goes to the Farplane. Just then, Dream Zanarkand and Tidus disappear, now that the freed fayth stopped the summoning. Afterward, {{in a speech to the}} citizens of Spira, Yuna resolves to help rebuild their world now that it <b>is</b> <b>free</b> <b>of</b> Sin. In a post-credits scene, Tidus awakens under water. He then swims towards the ocean surface, and the screen fades to white.|$|E
