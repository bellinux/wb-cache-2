At the {{beginning}} of August President Ryti resigned to allow Finland to sue for peace again, which the new government did in late August. The Soviet peace terms were harsh, but the $600,000,000 reparations <b>demanded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring were reduced to $300,000,000, most likely due to pressure from the United States and Britain. However, after the ceasefire the Soviets insisted that the payments should be based on 1938 prices, which doubled the amount.

As the Germans had withdrawn, British troops under General Scobie had {{deployed}} to Athens, {{but there were}} concerns that the largely pro-communist Greek resistance, EAM and its military wing ELAS, would take power (see Greek Civil War) or come into conflict with British troops. Macmillan rode in a tank and was under sniper fire at the British Embassy. Despite the hostility of large sections of British and American opinion, who were sympathetic to the guerillas and hostile to what was seen as imperialist behaviour, he persuaded a reluctant Churchill, who visited Athens later in the month, to accept Archbishop Damaskinos as Regent {{on behalf of the}} exiled King George.

25|$|Less than a {{week after}} the assassination, President Johnson <b>demanded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name of {{patriotic}} duty that Warren head the governmental commission to investigate the death of John F. Kennedy. It was an unhappy experience for Warren, who did not want the assignment. As a judge, he valued candor and justice, but as a politician he recognized the need for secrecy in some matters. He insisted that the commission report should be unanimous, and so he compromised {{on a number of issues}} in order to get all the members to sign the final version. Many conspiracy theorists have attacked the commission's findings ever since, claiming that key evidence is missing or distorted and that there are many inconsistencies in the report. The Commission concluded that the assassination was the result of a single individual, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone. Fears of possible Soviet or Cuban foreign involvement in the assassination necessitated the establishment of a bipartisan commission that, in turn, sought to depoliticize Oswald's role by downplaying his Communist affiliations. The commission weakened its findings by not sharing the government's deepest secrets. The report's lack of candor furthered antigovernment cynicism, which in turn stimulated conspiracy theorists who propounded any number of alternative scenarios, many of which appear mutually contradictory.|$|E

The sovereign claims of would-be centralizing, South Indian rulers and the resources <b>demanded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name of that sovereignty diminished the resources which local chieftains used {{as a kind of}} royal largess; thus centralizing demands were opposed on moral as well as on political grounds by even quite modest chiefs.|$|E

Nevertheless, the students rallied and were attacked by ethnic Abkhazians.
