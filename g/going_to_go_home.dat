2500|$|The Buccaneers {{defeated}} the St. Louis Cardinals, only recently eliminated from playoff contention, {{for their first}} home victory. Gary Huff completed 7 of 12 passes, including 61- and 62-yarders to Morris Owens, {{the first of which}} went for a touchdown. The improved offensive line allowed no sacks. Huff's average of 14.3 yards per pass attempt is the third-best in Buccaneer history, and stood as the record until broken by Vinny Testaverde in 1992. Said Coach McKay following the victory: [...] "I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> take a shower, and tell myself what a great coach I am".

The fifty points the Bucs scored in their final two games were nearly as many (53) they had put up in the entire rest of the season (twelve games). They had scored only three points at home until this game, being shut out in five consecutive home games.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Objectives. Does {{predictive}} {{power for}} outcomes of {{neonatal intensive care}} unit (NICU) patients get better with time? Or does it get worse? We deter-mined the predictive power of Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP) scores and clinical intuitions {{as a function of}} day of life (DOL) for newborn infants admit-ted to our NICU. Methods. We identified 369 infants admitted to our NICU during 1996 – 1997 who required mechanical venti-lation. We calculated SNAP scores on DOL 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, and weekly thereafter until either death or extubation. We also asked nurses, residents, fellows, and attendings on each day of mechanical ventilation: “Do you think this child is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> live <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> their family, or die before hospital discharge?...|$|R

50|$|The {{morning after}} Allie is voted off, the contestants {{assemble}} and Tina makes an announcement. She asksthat, {{despite the fact}} that she fought hard to stay this week, she be voted off this week, because she recently withdrew $16,000 from her 401K in order to take her family on the vacation of a lifetime, which she will miss unless she gets voted off. The other contestants react with anger. It was a painful decision to vote off Allie, a 300-pound 22-year-old, and thousands of people wish they were on the show, and now Tina is wasting that opportunity. She starts crying. Lisa is particularly upset, and says now she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> early so that she can help Allie, since they live 10 miles apart and Allie has nobody. The others get angry at Lisa for saying that - she has to think of herself, and her own children, and not use Allie as an excuse to give up. Bob tells the camera that contestants go crazy after someone has been voted off for the first time. He takes Tina and Lisa aside individually and inspires them to be committed to staying on the Ranch and becoming as healthy as possible. They have a very tough workout. Jesse talks back to Bob, and Bob starts working everyone harder as punishment. Frado is shown making lots of noise in the gym - it's what he's known for. Lisa becomes re-energized and says she feels proud of herself after the workout. Brendan, Frado, and Patrick form a secret alliance to stick together until the end. Anna Kournikova comes by and they have a tennis workout. Then they have an immunity challenge, in which contestants have to pick up tennis balls from a court and run to cylinders set up with everyone's name. they put one tennis ball in each cylinder on each trip. Everyone immediately starts putting them in Tina's cylinder, and she is quickly knocked out. Then, the men start targeting the women, who are knocked out one by one. Ultimately, Frado gets immunity. They have a surprise weigh-in, and people are subject to the curse of Week 2, with most posting disappointing numbers. Half fall under the yellow line, mostly women. The Biggest Loser of the week (in this case, Adam) is allowed to save one of the people who are below the yellow line, and he saves Aaron. The people below the yellow line have a challenge - they must dig through a huge pile of sand and find one of the brass rings that is buried. The two who do not find a ring will be up for elimination. Tina and Lisa are the losers - the two who had talked of going home before. Tina is voted off. At <b>homes,</b> she <b>goes</b> from 263 pounds to 205 pounds. Her daughter, who had also tried out for the show, loses 80 pounds at home.|$|R
50|$|Kayleigh {{first arrived}} on Coronation Street on 18 March 2007 with her dad, grandad and {{siblings}} Jodie, Mel and Darryl. Her family were giving their neighbours headaches {{after just a}} few hours on the street with their loud music. On her first day at Weatherfield High Sophie Webster and Chesney Battersby-Brown told her about the teachers and Sophie told Kayleigh how the teachers would take her rings off of her. Instead of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> school she <b>went</b> <b>home</b> and when Jerry found her he asked why she wasn't at school. An argument ensued and Kayleigh snapped that she wished she could go back and live with her mum. Realising he couldn't keep her with him against her will, Jerry was forced to agree to Kayleigh's wishes and phoned Teresa. Kayleigh was delighted <b>to</b> be <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> live with her mum but it was clear that Jerry was devastated. Kayleigh left the following day. A pattern soon emerged of her regular and lengthy visits to her father's house. Jodie noticed how Kayleigh was very quick at eating her breakfast and that she kept requesting money. After several days, Jerry offered to drop her off as he was suspicious of the situation. It turned out that Teresa had gone on holiday and left Kayleigh to look after her six-year-old half-brother Finlay whilst she was away. As a result of this, she has temporarily moved back into her dad's house with Finlay. Teresa turned up a few weeks later. Jerry had taken her TV away and several other electrical items. She didn't seem that bothered about her kids and only wanted her TV back. She agreed to let Jerry keep the kids if she could have her telly back. Jerry agreed to this.|$|R

6000|$|The wind, as I before said, blew freshly {{from the}} southwest. The night {{was very clear}} and cold. Augustus had taken the helm, and I {{stationed}} myself by the mast, {{on the deck of}} the cuddy. We flew along at a great rate--neither of us having said a word since casting loose from the wharf. I now asked my companion what course he intended to steer, and what time he thought it probable we should get back. He whistled for a few minutes, and then said crustily: [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sea--you may <b>go</b> <b>home</b> if you think proper." [...] Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at once that, in spite of his assumed nonchalance, he was greatly agitated. I could see him distinctly by the light of the moon--his face was paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he could scarcely retain hold of the tiller. I found that something had gone wrong, and became seriously alarmed. At this period I knew little about the management of a boat, and was now depending entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend. The wind, too, had suddenly increased, as we were fast getting out of the lee of the land--still I was ashamed to betray any trepidation, and for almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence. I could stand it no longer, however, and spoke to Augustus about the propriety of turning back. As before, it was nearly a minute before he made answer, or took any notice of my suggestion. [...] "By-and-by," [...] said he at length--"time enough--home by-and-by." [...] I had expected a similar reply, but there was something in the tone of these words which filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. I again looked at the speaker attentively. His lips were perfectly livid, and his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely able to stand. [...] "For God's sake, Augustus," [...] I screamed, now heartily frightened, [...] "what ails you?--what is the matter?--what are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do?" [...] "Matter!" [...] he stammered, in the greatest apparent surprise, letting go the tiller at the same moment, and falling forward into the bottom of the boat--"matter--why, nothing is the--matter--going home--d--d--don't you see?" [...] The whole truth now flashed upon me. I flew to him and raised him up. He was drunk--beastly drunk--he could no longer either stand, speak, or see. His eyes were perfectly glazed; and as I let him go in the extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the bilge-water, from which I had lifted him. It was evident that, during the evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and that his conduct in bed had been the result of a highly-concentrated state of intoxication--a state which, like madness, frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses. The coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual effect--the mental energy began to yield before its influence--and the confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. He was now thoroughly insensible, and there was no probability that he would be otherwise for many hours.|$|R
