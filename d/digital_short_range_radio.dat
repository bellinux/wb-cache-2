40|$|With the {{deployment}} {{of a large number}} of fe-mto-cells, interference reduction and energy consumption considerations are becoming an important topic. This has been captured in TR 36. 902, where it is stated that capacity could be improved through interference reduction by switching off those cells that are not conveying traffic at some point of time, in particular the H(e) NB’s when the users are not at home. So far several proposals have been made presen-ting different alternatives, for example detecting when the user is not in the coverage area of the nearest macrocell or proposing a specific solu-tion based on S 1 signalling. However, a simple and effective wake-up mechanism for a H(e) NB is one based on a specific <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>radio</b> in-terface for determining the proximity of the UE to the H(e) NB, provided that this <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>radio</b> interface does not add complexity to both the UE and the H(e) NB and the battery lifetime of the UE is not compromised...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Commercial {{off-the-shelf}} autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) {{are commonly}} equipped with <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>radios</b> (for high bandwidth, low-cost close range operation) and satellite modems (for low bandwidth, global operation). In a coastal observatory it should thus {{be possible to}} exploit an AUVs’ proximity to the coast to use the <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>radios</b> when vehicles are within useful communication range of coastal base stations, and to use satellite communications otherwise. Measurements in the coastal ocean using a Slocum glider and a network of elevated, coastal base stations show that the useful communication range depends strongly on two parameters 1) {{the distance between the}} vehicle and the base station, and 2) the local sea state experienced by the vehicle. Here we describe measurements of communication quality in a coastal setting over 206 glider surfacing events at ranges between 2. 4 and 16 km from the base station. The glider was instrumented with an accelerometer. At each surfacing, the accelerations experienced by the glider due to the local sea state were recorded concurrently with communication quality. Analysis of these measurements provides the first evidence {{that it is possible to}} predict communication quality from the sea state at a vehicle’s location and the distance between the vehicle and the nearest base station. This enables a simple, yet useful, piece of logic that allows onboard decision making on whether the vehicle should use its <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>radio</b> or its satellite modem. We discuss how this finding enables online modification of lowlevel communication protocol parameters. I...|$|R

Arjan is active in the <b>Short</b> <b>Range</b> <b>Radio</b> division, and will briefly outline the interests and activities of this group. Furthermore he will present some results of the research that he did during his short sabbatical in Belfast last year. This concerns the performance analysis of a frequency offset modulation scheme using wideband noise carriers. The main advantage of such a scheme is that it enables fast receiver synchronization without channel adaptation, while providing robustness to multipath fading and in-band interference. This is important for low-power wireless systems with bursty traffic, such as sensor networks. In the talk a semi-analytical framework for evaluating its bit error rate performance in wideband frequency-selective fading channels will be described. Some numerical results will be presented, based on channel models developed in the IEEE 802. 15. 4 a channel modeling subgroup.

50|$|The {{first steps}} towards {{creating}} licence-free <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>radio</b> communications {{were taken in}} April 1997 when the European Radio Communications Committee decided on a 446 MHz frequency band {{to be used for}} the new radios. In November 1998 another three decisions followed which designated the new frequency band for PMR446, established licence exemption for PMR446 equipment and established free circulation of the PMR446 equipment. The first country which introduced these frequencies for licence-free use was Ireland and it did so on 1 April 1998. The United Kingdom introduced PMR446 service in April 1999. Since 2003, PMR446 has replaced the former short-range business radio (SRBR) service.

30|$|Nowadays the {{application}} of <b>short</b> <b>range</b> wireless technologies continues to grow, which requires the radio spectrum, a scarce resource, to be well-managed. Most of these modern wireless technologies {{take place in a}} frequency range from 200 MHz to 3 GHz where spectrum sensing is key to many applications. For instance, several applications in this frequency range need spectrum sensing to identify white spaces (dynamic spectrum access (DSA) applications) but also telecom operators use spectrum sensing to measure utilization and interference. An important part of these <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>radio</b> communication systems is currently active in the license-free 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band, i.e., systems like Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 b/g/n), Bluetooth, wireless sensor networks, wireless A/V links (e.g., wireless cameras).
