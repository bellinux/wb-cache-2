5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E

[...] He then had sex with his mother's corpse, hid it in a closet and went out to drink. Upon his return, he invited his mother's best friend, 59-year-old Sara Taylor [...] "Sally" [...] Hallett, over to the house for dinner and a movie. When Hallett arrived, he strangled her to death, decapitated her and spent the night with her exanimate body.

6000|$|There is {{a legend}} about the natural {{philosophy}} class-room, the period long antecedent to Tait. The professor, annoyed by a habit students had got into of leaving their hats on his desk, {{announced that the}} next hat placed there would be cut in pieces by him in presence of the class. The warning had its effect, until one day when the professor was called {{for a few minutes}} from the room. An undergraduate, to whom the natural sciences, unrelieved, were a monotonous study, slipped into the ante-room, from which he emerged with the professor's hat. This he placed on the desk, and then stole in a panic to his seat. An awe fell upon the class. The professor returned, but when he saw the hat he stopped. He showed no anger. [...] "Gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "I told you what would happen if you again disobeyed my orders." [...] Quite blandly he took a pen-knife from his pocket, slit the hat into several pieces, and flung them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> While the hat was under the knife, the students forgot to demonstrate; but as it splashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> they gave forth a true British cheer.

60|$|In {{cruising}} thus leisurely, {{they made}} the coast of Cochin China; and the tempests, which rose at the same time, threatened them more than once with shipwreck. The idolaters had recourse to their ordinary superstitions. The lot declared, that the wind should fall, {{and that there was}} no danger. But an impetuous gust so raised the waves, that the mariners were forced to lower their sails, and cast anchor. The shog of the vessel threw a young Chinese (whom Xavier had christened, and carried along with him) <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> which was then open. They drew him out half dead, much bruised, and hurt in the head very dangerously. While they were dressing him, the captain's daughter fell into the sea, and was swallowed by the waves, notwithstanding all they could do to save her.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, the idolaters, {{instead of}} {{acknowledging}} that their idol had deceived {{them with a}} lie, took pains to appease him, as if {{the death of the}} Chinese woman had been an effect of their god's displeasure. They sacrificed birds to him, and burnt incense in honour of him; after which they cast lots again to know the cause of this disaster which had befallen them. They were answered, [...] "That if the young Christian, who had fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> had died, the captain's daughter had been preserved." [...] Then Neceda, transported with fury, thought to throw Xavier and his companions overboard. But the storm ceasing in an instant, his mind grew calmer by degrees, he weighed anchor, and set sail again, and took the way of Canton, with intention there to pass the winter. But the designs of men, and power of devils, can do nothing against the decrees of Providence. A contrary wind broke all the projects of the captain, constraining him, in his own despite, to enter with full sails into the ocean of Japan. And the same wind carried the junk of the pirate toward Cangoxima, the birth-place of Anger, sirnamed Paul de Sainte Foy. They arrived there on the fifteenth of August, in the year 1549.|$|E

60|$|He went on {{with his}} fables. His mother and brother, he declared, had often asked him to tell them when his master went to collect rents. He had done so after Harrison started for Charringworth {{on the morning of}} August 16. John Perry next gave an account of his {{expedition}} with his brother in the evening of the fatal day, an account which was incompatible with his previous tale of his doings and with the authentic evidence of Reed and Pierce. Their honest version destroyed Perry's new falsehood. He declared that Richard Perry and he had dogged Harrison, as he came home at night, into Lady Campden's grounds; Harrison had used a key to the private gate. Richard followed him into the grounds; John Perry, after a brief stroll, joined him there and found his mother (how did she come thither?) and Richard standing over the prostrate Harrison, whom Richard incontinently strangled. They seized Harrison's money and meant to put his body 'in the great sink by Wallington's Mill.' John Perry left them, and knew not whether the body was actually thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> In fact, non est inventus in the sink, any more than in the bean-rick. John next introduced his meeting with Pierce, but quite forgot that he had also met Reed, and did not account for that part of his first story, which Reed and Pierce had both corroborated. The hat, comb, and band John said that he himself had carried away from Harrison's body, had cut them with his knife, and thrown them into the highway. Whence the blood on the band came he neglected to say.|$|E
