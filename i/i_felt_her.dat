500|$|Jackson {{describes}} Lena Horne as {{a profound}} inspiration, for entertainers of several generations {{as well as}} herself. Upon Horne's death, she stated [...] " [...] brought much joy into everyone's lives—even the younger generations, younger than myself. She {{was such a great}} talent. She opened up such doors for artists like myself." [...] Similarly, she considers Dorothy Dandridge to be one of her idols. Jackson has declared herself [...] "a very big Joni Mitchell fan", explaining [...] "As a kid I was drawn to Joni Mitchell records [...] Joni's songs spoke to me in an intimate, personal way." [...] She holds reverence for Tina Turner, stating [...] "Tina has become a heroic figure for many people, especially women, because of her tremendous strength. Personally, Tina doesn't seem to have a beginning or an end in my life. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> music was always there, and I feel like it always will be." [...] She has also named other socially conscious acts, such as Tracy Chapman, Sly and the Family Stone, U2, and Bob Dylan as sources of inspiration. In her early career, Jackson credited her brothers Michael and Jermaine as musical influences. According to Rolling Stone and MTV, other artists attributed as influences are The Ronettes, Dionne Warwick, Tammi Terrell, Diana Ross, Chaka Khan, Stevie Wonder, Teena Marie, Michael Jackson, Prince, and Tina Turner ...|$|E
2500|$|Kuk Harrell, {{one of the}} {{producers}} of Talk That Talk, spoke on the recording of the album saying: [...] "In addition to touring, we are recording Rihanna's new album. We have a portable studio that we set up at the different hotels that we are staying at. We set up shop anywhere in the hotel. Before {{we went on the}} European leg of Rihanna's Loud tour, we started recording the album in Los Angeles. Rihanna likes to work late hours, so she would come into the studio at 9pm and work until 6am." [...] Continuing Harrell stated [...] "The show was the priority, and then the album. That's how the day was broken up." [...] Expanding on this Harrell stated that Rihanna would perform every night, finish her meet [...] and greet by 1 a.m. Then go to the studio for around two or three a.m. During these session Harrell stated [...] "I’d make the decision based off where <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> voice was. Knowing she just did two hours of a show and meet-and-greets, I would suggest capturing the stuff that was easier to get like the lower-range stuff so we wouldn’t hurt or damage her voice." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> {{wonderful}} eyes searching {{mine and}} my face more closely.|$|E
60|$|Left {{alone with}} the mother, I again {{expressed}} the gratitude <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> to <b>her</b> {{as well as to}} her daughter.|$|R
60|$|I {{could see}} that the poor girl was near crying, and I resumed my chair without {{speaking}} and looked at her (I hope) as mildly as <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> towards <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Shore she's almost gone," [...] he said, dismally. [...] "It took my nerve, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> of <b>her</b> face.... Thet orful wail is {{her breath}} chokin' in her throat.... Like a death-rattle, only long instead of short." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently I {{knew that}} she was {{standing}} at my side. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> hand laid upon my shoulder.|$|E
60|$|We {{were walking}} very close together. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> fingers {{suddenly}} upon {{my arm and}} her soft breath upon my cheek.|$|E
60|$|She gave a {{start and}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> large eyes look at me, but I {{went on with}} it and with my needlework.|$|E
5000|$|... "When I met Morwenna Banks {{and read}} <b>her</b> script, <b>I</b> really <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> passion {{for this story}} — this is {{something}} she lived through. She managed to take real life {{and turn it into}} a powerful, laugh-and-cry-out-loud screenplay." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> almost <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> warm {{breath as}} she stole past me. I caught a gleam of a pale face, {{sufficient}} {{to tell me}} who she was. She passed on and took up her stand outside that small end window.|$|R
6000|$|... "Beatrice," [...] he confessed, [...] "I was a thick-headed ignorant fool, without understanding. I {{came to you}} for safety. I {{was afraid}} of Elizabeth, I was afraid of what <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> for <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> wanted to escape from it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> {{trembling}} more. I {{waited for}} what was yet to come, and I now thought I began {{to know what it}} was.|$|E
6000|$|Outside in {{the starlight}} she looked white and very beautiful. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> tremble. Perhaps my gravity presaged the worst. So {{it did in}} one way--poor Vaughn! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sad and strange, Sally. That {{was worse}} than my bullet-holes." [...] She gripped my hand. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> hair on my brow, felt her breath on my cheek.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{suddenly}} he {{stuck in his}} speech, and stared with his mouth open over my shoulder. I turned, and there was Edie, with such a merry, roguish smile, standing in the door. How proud <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> of <b>her,</b> and of myself too, as I looked at her! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The better I knew her, {{the more}} {{interest}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in <b>her</b> fortunes. They gathered to a crisis. I found her beset by a selfish and ungrateful brother, beset by an unacceptable wooer, beset by the snares {{of a more}} powerful lover, beset by the wiles of her own heart.' ...|$|R
60|$|Melissa {{pinned on}} her hair again {{and put on}} her hat and drank the milk, all without a word; but she was purple. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sorry for <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me that I had but closed my eyes when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> hand upon my {{shoulder}} and heard her soft voice warning me of a new danger.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> {{pressure}} on my hand, {{and then she}} had fled into the house, leaving me standing by the steps looking after her. Comyn's voice aroused me.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought it}} best to let my dear girl have her way and to say no more about it. So I said as much. I said it lightly, because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> trembling.|$|E
6000|$|... "By my honour, then, I didn't see {{anything}} from the time I {{got out of the}} brook. I'd enough to do to sit where I was, and keep the mare's head straight. When she made the great leap, <b>I</b> hardly <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> feet come to the ground, she came down so lightly." ...|$|R
60|$|I thanked <b>her</b> most heartily. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{this was}} the real tender sympathy of a being of my own age and like myself, and there were {{something}} so pathetic in <b>her</b> expression that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sorry for <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|She gave me her hand. I stammered {{something}} about the pleasure <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in seeing <b>her</b> again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a long, long time.|$|R
60|$|She {{shook her}} head. She {{raised her hand}} timidly to the lapel of my coat, and {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> palm, cool and firm, upon my forehead. It rested there but an instant.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> hand {{trembling}} in my hand, {{and gave}} it a little encouraging squeeze. [...] "Let us judge him," [...] I suggested, [...] "by what he says and does, on finding us together." ...|$|E
6000|$|I obeyed, and bending {{so close}} that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> warm breath on my neck, she whispered: [...] "Are the people in Cuzco like me? Would they {{understand}} me--the things you cannot understand? Do you know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a slight}} pause before Adam said, [...] "My temper {{got the better of}} me, and I said things as wasn't true. I'd no right to speak as if you'd known you was doing me an injury: you'd no grounds for knowing it; I've always kept what <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> for <b>her</b> as secret as I could." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't a notion. She {{walked into}} Brown's hotel {{yesterday}} looking played out and anxious, and said somebody {{had told her}} I {{was going to the}} Bluff. As <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sorry for <b>her</b> <b>I</b> started at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{nine years}} since I've seen it, but I can't get those lines {{out of my}} head. Perhaps it's because of the girl who sang them. Somehow, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sorry for <b>her.</b> She had remarkably fine eyes." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> cold hand close fast on mine; {{the grasp}} of the chill, frail fingers was almost painful to me. Her lips moved, but her quick, hysterical {{breathing}} made the few words she uttered inarticulate.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> dreadful logic, but I couldn't--with my {{exquisite}} image all contrasted, as {{in a flash}} from flint, {{with this}} monstrosity--so much as entertain her question. I could only stupidly again sound it. [...] "Awfully sharp?" ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes opened}} wider and wider in unutterable expectation. She {{suddenly}} advanced her face {{so close to}} mine, that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> hot breath on my cheeks as the next words burst their way through her lips.|$|E
5000|$|Inspired {{by their}} romance, Marvin penned hit singles about Anna {{including}} [...] "Stubborn Kind of Fellow", [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] and [...] "You're a Wonderful One". Of [...] "Pride and Joy", Gaye said, [...] "When I composed 'Pride and Joy', I was {{head over heels}} in love with Anna. I just wrote what <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> about <b>her,</b> and what she did for me. She was my pride and joy." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stopped and}} laughed. [...] "It's nine years since I've seen it, but I can't get those lines {{out of my}} head. Perhaps it's because of the girl who sang them. Somehow, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sorry for <b>her.</b> She had remarkably fine eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> hadn't <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> warm to touch, I {{should have}} been dreaming to-night that I'd seen Mary's ghost." [...] This was the grim fancy which darkly troubled Mat's mind, {{at the very same}} moment when Madonna was {{thinking}} how cold his hand was. He turned away impatiently from some wine offered to him just then by Zack; and, looking vacantly into the fire, drew his coat-cuff several times over his eyes and forehead.|$|R
