5|$|We've {{always thought}} Lutz was the <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> sell it. But it's like how people claim they saw Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game or were at Woodstock. The {{landscape}} {{is littered with}} salesmen who say, 'Oh yeah, I was the <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> bring that in.' The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E

The backing track was recorded at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes, London, but {{the remainder of}} overdubs occurred at Abbey Road Studios. Musically, the song {{is made up of}} a suite of various segments, ranging from a piano ballad at the beginning through to guitar arpeggios at the end.|$|E
5|$|With his father, Las Casas {{immigrated to}} the island of Hispaniola in 1502 on the {{expedition}} of Nicolás de Ovando. Las Casas became a hacendado and slave owner, receiving {{a piece of land}} in the province of Cibao. He participated in slave raids and military expeditions against the native Taíno population of Hispaniola. In 1510, he was ordained a priest, the <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> be ordained in the Americas.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} the {{non-stop}} protests in Ottawa ended, non-stop protests began {{on the evening of}} 26 April in front of the Consulate of the United States in Toronto, urging Barack Obama to call for an immediate permanent ceasefire. Protesters sat down on University Avenue, occupying {{a large portion of the}} street. On the third day of the non-stop protest (29 April), fifteen arrests were made while one woman was injured after a brief scuffle with police. This incident was the <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> happen among these protests in Canada. The protests later shifted to Queen's Park with a diminished number of protesters.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant Junior Grade Clarence Samuels, born on Bohio, Panama, {{enlisted in}} the Coast Guard on July 16, 1920 and became a {{naturalized}} citizen of the United States on July 21, 1923. On May 12, 1939 he was appointed a chief photographer's mate becoming not only the first Hispanic of African descent photographer in the Guard, but also only the second photographer in {{the entire history of}} the Service. On July 29, 1944, he assumed command of Lightship No. 115, operating in the Panama Sea Frontier. Thus, he became the first admitted Hispanic of African descent to command a cutter, as well as the <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> be an officer-in-charge of a Coast Guard vessel during wartime. Samuels entered the Coast Guard as a seaman 2nd Class and reached the rank of lieutenant (as a part of the massive demobilization of the Coast Guard following the end of hostilities, his lieutenancy was revoked and he was dis-rated to chief photographer's mate). Samuels retired from the Coast Guard on September 1, 1947.|$|E
5|$|Müller {{started in}} all six matches that Germany {{played at the}} Euro 2016 finals. In the quarter-final match against Italy, Müller's shot was the <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> be saved in the penalty {{shoot-out}} during the tournament. This {{was the first time}} Germany failed to score in a shoot out since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup. Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5. Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding a goal to his name at the Euros.|$|E
5|$|San Martín's {{column was}} the <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> reach the enemy. The two cannons and the cannon {{fire from the}} ships defended the royalists, but they were quickly outmanoeuvred by the saber attacks and, unable to form a square, had to retreat. The {{advantage}} of surprise and {{the speed of the}} cavalry charge allowed the regiment to defeat the larger royalist army who had almost double the number of soldiers. When Bermúdez and his column joined the battle the royalists were not able to stand their ground and were routed, retreating in disarray under covering fire from the ships. Bermudez led the attack at this point as San Martín had fallen from his horse.|$|E

In 1861 the 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment became one of the first Hoosier regiments to see action in the war. The 9th Indiana fought in many major battles, including the Battle of Shiloh, the Battle of Stones River, the Atlanta Campaign, and the Battle of Nashville, among others.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} a Powers Picture Plays {{directed}} by Edwin August and {{distributed by the}} Universal Film Manufacturing Company. The film's production number was 0101. The screen play was written by Jeanie MacPherson who also {{played the role of}} The Girl. Simon Louvish, author of Cecil B. DeMille: A Life in Art, states this uncredited screenplay was the <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> be authored by MacPherson. Louvish also refers to this film as a two-reeler. Lon Chaney and Robert Z. Leonard had previously worked together for the Ferris Hartman Troupe. Three years prior to the release of the film, the two were involved in the production of musical comedies for the Troupe. In 1918, Leonard would later direct his wife, Mae Murry, and Lon Chaney in Danger, Go Slow.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} space station Horizon sends a distress signal to the ISIS agency, stating that the spaceship has been under attack. Anthony Drake (Bryan Cranston), {{the commander of the}} station, has urged ISIS to assist the crew in controlling the situation. A reluctant Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler) is the <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> voice concern over the issue, as none of them have undergone training in preparation for a flight. Despite these concerns, Malory Archer (Jessica Walter) is quick to take the job for financial gain. The field agents of ISIS—except Sterling Archer (H. Jon Benjamin), who is being evaluated by Doctor Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates) for medical purposes—are subjected to basic astronaut regimens in anticipation for the flight, including a flight simulator (which Archer makes Cyril crash), and weightlessness training, which causes Lana to vomit copiously {{because of the lack of}} gravity.|$|E

South Korean Chun Lee-Kyung has also won four gold medals (the <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> have done so, in 1998), {{as well as a}} bronze medal. Viktor Ahn has the most Olympic medals of any short-track speed skater. Tania Vicent of Canada is the oldest athlete to medal; she was 34 in 2010 when she won a silver medal in the 3000 metre relay. Kim Yoon-Mi of South Korea is the youngest; she was 13 when she won a gold in the same event.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two {{consecutive}} FA Cup finals, losing to Everton in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating Portsmouth in 1934. During the 1934 cup run, Manchester City broke {{the record for}} the highest home attendance of any club in English football history, as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth round FA Cup tie against Stoke City in 1934 – a record which still stands to this day. The club won the First Division title {{for the first time in}} 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division. Twenty years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the Revie Plan reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; just as in the 1930s, they lost the <b>first</b> <b>one,</b> <b>to</b> Newcastle United, and won the second. The 1956 final, in which Manchester City beat Birmingham City 3–1, is one of the most famous finals of all-time, and is remembered for City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking his neck.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} Gibraltar changed following {{the invention of}} steamships; the <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> reach Gibraltar's harbour arrived there in 1823. The advent of steamships caused {{a major shift in}} trade patterns in the Mediterranean. Transshipment, which had previously been Gibraltar's principal economic mainstay, was largely replaced by the much less lucrative work of servicing visiting steamships through coaling, victualling and ferrying of goods. Although Gibraltar became a key coaling station where British steamships refuelled on the way to Alexandria or Cape Horn, the economic changes resulted in a prolonged depression that lasted until {{near the end of the}} century. The demand for labour for coaling was such that Gibraltar instituted the practice of relying on large numbers of imported Spanish workers. A shanty town sprang up on the site of the old Spanish fortifications just across the border, which became the workers' town of La Línea de la Concepción. The poor economy meant that Gibraltar's population barely changed between 1830 and 1880, but it was still relatively more prosperous than the severely impoverished south of Spain. As a consequence, La Línea's population doubled over the same period and then doubled again in the following 20 years.|$|E
