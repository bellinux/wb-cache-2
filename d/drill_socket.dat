40|$|Large {{diameter}} long drilled shafts {{are commonly}} used to support tall buildings to resist both vertical and horizontal loads in the Far East including Hong Kong. The diameter of these drilled shafts ranges from 1. 0 m to 1. 8 m and from 28 m to 60 m in depth. They typically penetrate through and found in weathered rocks and soils. Generally, the design for side shear of large diameter drilled shafts in weathered rocks and soils involve considerable uncertainty and design parameters must usually be verified by field tests. In this paper, 27 full-scale load tests on large diameter drilled shaft including 14 drilled shafts founded in soils and 13 <b>drilled</b> shafts <b>socketed</b> in weathered rocks are reviewed and studied in detail. Particular attention {{is given to the}} degree of mobilization of side shear in soil and rock socket side shear. The authors were heavily involved in the recent construction and testing of 11 of these drilled shafts. For drilled shafts in soils, 90 % of ultimate side shear is mobilized at average local displacement of 1. 9 % the shaft diameter. The average side shear normalized with N and a value are 1. 2 N kPa and 0. 3, respectively. Three alternative approaches, tIN vs. L, vs. a, and s. A' are proposed and clear trend lines were identified for different soil types by these three approaches. For the <b>drilled</b> shafts <b>socketed</b> in rock, side shear is analyzed with regard to rock type and is compared to the findings and correlations published in literature. Alternative correlations for predicting side shear capacity in granitic rocks in Hong Kong are proposed. For drilled shaft subjected to cyclic loading, significant hysteresis effect is identified. For multi-stage tests on drilled shafts in soil, the stiffness and mobilized side shear at the first and second stages are similar. However, for <b>drilled</b> shaft <b>socketed</b> in weathered rocks, both the stiffness of the rock socket and the mobilizedside resistance were lower at the second stage...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} five axial loading tests on large-diameter <b>drilled</b> piles <b>socketed</b> into rock are {{discussed}} in this paper. The piles were built on an Italian site where several shallow rock formations are found below loose soils. Pile sockets involved rocks with different strengths such as: marl, limestone, gypsum and diabase. The pile response during static loading depended on rock strength, length of the socket in rock, and length of the pile in soil. In this paper, an analytical model is {{used to evaluate the}} limit skin friction at the pile-rock interface. The model is based on the hyperbolic transfer function technique and allows back-analyses to be carried out easily. Following current empirical approaches, a preliminary appraisal of the model parameters is made using extensive data from laboratory and in situ tests. The parameters are subsequently modified by fitting the measured pile head displacements to computer simulation results. The shaft resistance values obtained from the analyses are compared with published values and found to be lower...|$|R

40|$|The {{costs of}} {{installing}} tidal energy technology are high, requiring expensive vessels to <b>drill</b> <b>sockets</b> {{in the sea}} bed or to handle gravity based structures of substantial mass, and this impacts on the commercial viability of any proposed marine renewables development. This thesis offers {{a viable alternative to}} socketed or gravity based installations by proposing that the downwards lift force that can be developed from the flow over a hydrofoil can be used to resist the slip and overturning moments applied to a structure by the flow. The fundamental theory of axial and crossflow energy conversion devices is outlined and the current methods of fixing and supporting tidal stream devices are analysed. The origins of tidal stream flows are discussed and the effects of local topography, bathymetry and system resonance are used to explain the significant differences between real tidal behaviour and the ideal of Newton’s equilibrium theory. The idiosyncratic and localised nature of tidal streams is thereby made clear as well as the need for a solid understanding of the resource prior to device design and installation. The principles of classical hydrodynamics and conformal mapping are used in the context of relating theoretical lift and drag functions to low aspect ratio hydrofoils with endplates, and a numerical model of distributed surface pressures around a hydrofoil is demonstrated. Subsequently, the concept is evaluated using two 1 / 7 th scale test devices, one is field tested in a large stream under real flow conditions, and the second in a tow tank under ideal laboratory conditions. The limitations and challenges of model scaling are shown and the semi-empirical Froude method of scaling using residual forces is applied to the towing model. Analysis of the experimental data shows a correlation with normal distribution and extrapolation of the experimental results shows that the Sea Snail can operate with an average lift coefficient of 0. 7 and drag coefficient of 0. 18. Application of the experimental data to the full scale device demonstrates that the Sea Snail principle is not only valid, but is a significant advance on existing installation methodologies.

40|$|Three field load {{tests of}} <b>drilled</b> shafts <b>socketed</b> in Burlington {{limestone}} were conducted using the Osterberg load cell. The objective {{of these tests}} was to compare the shaft capacities obtained from the field load tests with capacities predicted using analytical methods and with typi-cal presumptive design capacities. It was believed that the actual ca-pacities of the drilled shafts would be considerably greater than the capacities predicted from presumptive bearing capacity values. Based {{on the results of}} this testing, the following conclusions were drawn. Observed values of side resistance are comparable to the predicted val-ues obtained from empirical relationships. Observed values of end bearing pressure greatly exceed the presumptive values of allowable bearing capacity commonly used for the design of shafts bearing on Burlington limestone. The test shafts were not failed in end bearing and it is believed that the ultimate end bearing pressures would signifi-cantly exceed the observed end bearing pressures. The actual factors of safety of shafts in Burlington limestone that are designed for end bearing only, using typical presumptive end bearing capacities, will exceed 6. Side resistance will carry {{a large portion of the}} load and for service loads, the entire load may be carried by side friction.

40|$|Objective: This study {{compared}} {{the effects of}} three different methods of preparing bone implant <b>sockets</b> (<b>drilling,</b> osteotomes, and piezoelectric device) on osseointegration using resonance frequency analysis (RFA). Study Design: An experimental prospective study was designed. Material and Methods: Ten adult beagle dogs were studied. After 5 weeks, 23 out of 28 initially placed implants in the iliac crest were evaluated, comparing these three different procedures of bone implant socket. Student’s t-test (paired, two-tailed) was used to reveal differences among the three groups {{at each time point}} (SPSS 16. 0, IL, USA). Results: After a 5 -week healing period, the implants placed in sockets that were made using an osteotome or pie-zoelectric device were slightly more stable than those made by drilling. Reduced mechanical and heat injury to the bone is beneficial for maintaining and improving stability during the critical early healing period. Conclusion: Using RFA, there was evidence of a slight increase in implant stability in the iliac crest after 5 weeks of healing when the implant socket was made using a piezoelectric device or expansion procedure as compare with the drilling method...|$|R

40|$|Conditions {{encountered}} {{by the authors}} on several projects (tunnel boring, blast hole drill-ing, and large diameter pile <b>socket</b> <b>drilling)</b> were unanticipated, undetectable, and even difficult to identify even after they had been encountered. These conditions have caused failure of mechanical components, low penetra-tion rates, and remarkably high cutter wear. Coincidentally, all projects had one or more geotechnical conditions in common.

50|$|In restaurants, wine {{is usually}} {{served by the}} litre, 750 mL or 500 mL bottle, but a wine glass is {{measured}} in ounces. Similarly, fast food restaurants (e.g. McDonald's Quarter Pounder) often advertise measurements of food and drink in US customary units, but converted to metric units, because either the containers are made to US standards, or the franchise is US-based and uses a standard size for its products. Thus in Canada a 20 US fluid ounce bottled soft drink is labelled as 591 mL (or occasionally rounded up to 600 mL). Beer in bottles continues to be 12 imperial fluid ounces (labelled as 341 mL), but beer in cans is filled to 12 US fluid ounces (labelled as 355 mL). There is also a larger sized beer bottle which is labelled as containing 1.18 L. Some of these package sizes have been introduced since Canadian metrication began; for example, the traditional Canadian soft drink can was 10 imperial fluid ounces (284 mL), later marketed as 280 mL. Only in the early 1990s did the US-derived 355 mL size displace it. Television sets and computer screens are also measured in inches. Standard and special fasteners like alloys, nuts, bolts, washers, studs, tapping, self <b>drilling</b> screw and <b>socket</b> screware are often quoted in both imperial and metric; products range from 2/56 in diameter up to 4 in.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect on side shear resistance in limestone when temporary casing is used. Due to testing in actual limestone being an unrealistic goal, simulated limestone mixes were prepared and cast into 6 – 42 in. diameter beds. Limestone throughout Florida can be quite varied (e. g. 50 - 5000 psi) but where stronger limestone is not likely to be penetrated by casing installation. Therefore, target unconfined compressive strengths of the study specimens ranged between 60 psi to 850 psi. A simulated limestone material was developed based on over 200 cylinders cast for unconfined compression testing where the binder (cement or lime), water to binder ratio, aggregate types (sand, coquina, and oyster shells), and binder content were all varied. Results of the laboratory tests were used to establish simulated limestone mixes for 42 in. diameter specimen beds in which 1 / 10 th scale <b>drilled</b> shaft rock <b>sockets</b> were cast. <b>Drilled</b> shaft casing installation techniques were adapted to 1 / 10 th scale where driven casing and oscillated/rotated casing methods were simulated. Within each of the simulated limestone test beds, 5 shaft specimens were cast with and without temporary casing where at least one of the specimens was cast without temporary casing (control specimen). Pullout tests of each specimen revealed that the presence of temporary casing reduced the side shear by 25 to 28 percent depending on the casing installation/extraction method. However, in all cases representative of weaker limestone, the measured reduction did not affect the anticipated design side shear resistance...|$|R
30|$|The {{recently}} described all-inside graft-link technique {{using two}} TightRope Reverse Tension devices is an a ACL procedure which present some advantages such as lower morbidity of donor site, less postoperative pain and tensioning {{from both sides}} of the graft at any degree of extension [14, 15]. This technique is based on <b>drilling</b> two bone <b>sockets</b> on both the femoral and tibial sides using the Flipcutter drill (Arthrex®). Moreover, this technique also allows the surgeon to perform an anatomical ACL reconstruction in cases with a shorter depth of the femoral condyle because the graft completely fills the socket, which should be at least 20 – 25  mm to ensure bone graft incorporation. For all these reasons, graft length is crucial for ACL all-inside reconstruction to achieve complete filling of the graft on both tibial and femoral sockets with an adequate intra-articular portion. As well described by Lubowitz, meticulous graft preparation is crucial for a successful technique, so the author recommends the following graft characteristic: no greater than 270  mm in length, so that the final length when quadrupled is no more than 75  mm [13]. However, if the harvested graft has inadequate length, it is suggested that the graft be tripled or even to harvest the gracilis. Results from this study seem to demonstrate that, although the “quadrupled” tendon achieved the best UFL, the “tripled” configuration also had sufficient biomechanical characteristics to safely withstand loads experienced during early rehabilitation, while the “half-quadrupled” configuration demonstrated a lower strength. For this reason, with a total semitendinosus length of less than 260  mm it is better to “triple” instead of “half-quadruple” it, to achieve better graft performance.|$|R
40|$|The current design {{methodology}} for a drilled shaft foundation in cohesionless soil is primarily based on ultimate skin friction values of drilled shafts. In {{order to obtain}} these values for each soil type, load tests such as Osterberg test are designed and performed. The Osterberg test layout is designed to estimate the capacity of drilled shaft by applying an upward load during the test and then calculating the downward capacity assuming the upward and downward capacity are the same. This method is appropriate for soils not containing caliche layers because caliche layers bond to the shaft and prevent skin friction to reach its ultimate capacity during the load test. As long as ultimate skin friction is achieved, the location of O-cell with respect to any of existing soil layers is not an effective. Osterberg test results in soils containing caliche indicate that the ultimate skin friction is not achieved and shaft/caliche interaction is mostly elastic. In these cases, {{the behavior of the}} shaft when it is loaded from the bottom is different from when it is loaded from the top. This study will show that, the location of O-cell with respect to the caliche layers will influence the interpretation of test results. The study will investigate the current interpretation method when O-cell is installed at a location far from caliche and will compare the equivalent top-down load from test results to when the shaft is loaded from the top. The reason for discrepancies between the behavior of the shaft in these two loading scenario will be explained. Additionally, the interpretation for tests when O-cell is installed close to caliche will be investigated and the behavior of the shaft will be compared for upward and downward loading. The procedure is performed by collecting 30 Osterberg load tests in soils containing caliche. The test layouts with O-cell installed at identified locations are selected. The 2 -D finite element software PLAXIS 8 is then used to simulate the Osterberg tests. The models are calibrated using field Osterberg tests and then loaded conventionally from the top. The behavior of the shaft during top-down loading is compared to interpreted test results from Osterberg test. A test layout with O-cell at a location far from the caliche layers shown to have a higher capacity during conventional loading compared to interpreted test results from Osterberg load test. On the other hand when O-cell is installed close to caliche, the top-down loading shows a similar behavior to interpreted test results from Osterberg load test. In fact when O-cell and caliche layers are close to each other, the test layout is similar to the procedure performed to estimate rock <b>socketed</b> <b>drilled</b> shafts capacity. The results of this study will help engineers to have better understanding of the drilled shafts behavior in soils containing caliche by introducing an appropriate test design and interpretation of the test results...|$|R
