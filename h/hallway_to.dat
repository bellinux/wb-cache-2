5|$|Once the Trust took ownership, {{scaffolding}} {{was placed}} in the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> repair the roof lantern. While this was in place the architectural paint analyst Lisa Oestreicher was able to examine the decorative scheme that had been used in the spaces and room frequented by the public. Three principal phases were identified: 1860s original; 1870s updates and adaptions; 1887–90 redecoration, which returned the main spaces to the original green colours and motifs created by Crace. Once lantern repairs were complete, the Trust replaced the elderly chenille carpet destroyed by contractors working for Christie's with a new Wilton carpet with a replica design by Linney Cooper, bought with £45,000 from public lottery donations.|$|E
5|$|The {{long take}} video begins with many people dancing on a hallway, until a girl comes and opens a door {{which leads to}} a room. There, other dancers are dancing to the song in midway of white rays of light, until the camera shows Jackson {{in the corner of the}} room and they start {{performing}} a dance routine. While the singer disappears from vision, people dance until she appears again dancing to the song. Then she goes to a hallway and enters a red-lighted room, accompanied by dancers, where entertainer Mimi Marks is seen. There she dances another routine along with her dancers. After dancing, she enters in another hallway where she gets alone with a man, until they share a kiss. Then, people who were in the previous room enter to the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> connect to another room, with Marks taking Jackson with her. The video ends with people coming closer to Jackson.|$|E
25|$|Inside this residence, {{the house}} {{originally}} {{had a very}} simple interior, with a large living room {{to the right of}} the front door, a simple dining room straight ahead, a long <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> the left of the front door, a simple spiral staircase in the front hall, and a small kitchen and servants' quarters in the back (now a bigger kitchen). In the interior of the house, the forms of the rooms were simple but combined to make a more complex structure like Breuer and Gropius advocated. The house has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.|$|E

25|$|Terminal 2 is due {{to receive}} a major extension, to {{encompass}} current remote stands to the west. Between twelve and fifteen covered aircraft stands will be made available by this. An air side link for transferring passengers between Terminals 1 and 2 is at the planning stage, designed {{in an effort to}} boost Manchester's chances of becoming a major hub airport and minimise missed connections. It was announced in June 2015 that the airport would have an expansion taking 10 years to complete. Terminal 2 will be the most developed, adding new piers to the terminal and also create a larger security hall as well as more outlets. There will also be a connecting <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> Terminal 3.|$|E
25|$|In May 1972, two loyalist gunmen {{called to}} the MacBride family's door and Nora MacBride, who was {{carrying}} a baby at the time, went to answer the door. The men duped Mrs. MacBride into opening the door by stating {{that they were looking}} for Frank, a building contractor, and were seeking work. When the door was opened the gunmen then saw Frank coming down the narrow <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> see who was at the door. They opened fire shooting Frank in the shoulder, hand and thighs, then Antoine came out from a side room to protect his father and was shot in the leg. Frank MacBride was hit by 12 bullets and never recovered from the attack, dying 17 months later.|$|E
500|$|Ariana Richards said, [...] "I {{was called}} into a casting office, {{and they just}} wanted me to scream. I heard later on that Steven had watched a few girls on tape that day, and I {{was the only one}} who ended up waking his {{sleeping}} wife off the couch, and she came running through the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> see if the kids were all right." [...] Joseph Mazzello had initially screen-tested for a role in Hook, but was deemed too young. Spielberg promised Mazzello that they would work together on a future film. Robin Wright turned down a role in the film. Christina Ricci auditioned for a role, but did not receive it.|$|E

50|$|Several {{additions}} {{have been}} made to the building over the years. The first addition added <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> the ends of the existing <b>hallways</b> <b>to</b> create two square hallways coming off of the main walkways. With that addition in the 1990s, Minooka added more technology and classroom space. Next came the new physical education department space that has been added in the last 4 or 5 years. This addition created more room for PE classes, along with driver's ed classrooms and more. The other big addition was building a new lunch room. This glass panel, rounded room, is the location of lunch, after school programs, athletic practices, concerts, musicals & plays, and the homecoming dance.|$|R

500|$|While Henert {{established}} perimeters around Cole Hall, Mitchell and Grady {{entered the}} building, where {{they met with}} Holland, Ellington, and Wright. [...] Ellington, the first officer to arrive on the scene, evacuated the adjacent auditorium, and met with the other officers in the front walkway. [...] Holland was instructed {{to remain in the}} <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> ensure no one came into the auditorium and that the shooter did not come out. Grady, Mitchell, Ellington, and Wright entered the south auditorium, discovering a body on the stage, surrounded by guns, with a pool of blood coming from the head. Victims with varying injuries lay on the floor or were propped up against the seats. Confirming there were no immediate threats, Grady and Mitchell began attending to victims, while Ellington and Wright confirmed that the shooter was dead. [...] At 3:11:42 (five minutes after the first 911 call), Ellington reported to the dispatcher, [...] "Shooter's down. Shotgun's secure. [...] We need an ambulance and the coroner at Cole Hall." ...|$|E
500|$|The initial {{conservation}} work focused around weatherproofing the house. The {{repair of}} the roof, which is 20 {{times the size}} of the average British family’s home, was made possible by the erection of an extensive free-standing scaffold roof structure. At the height of the restoration works, [...] of scaffolding tubes covered the building's entire exterior. This allowed over 18 months repairs and restoration to take place, including the final restoration of the original bold red and black tiled geometric diaper pattern. The entire property was rewired with special cabling, copper sheathed (fire and rodent proofed). Much of the original lead piping was replaced and a fireproofing scheme, mainly through the design of a suitable compartmentation system was designed and implemented. Interior scaffolding was installed in the [...] high <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> repair the lantern rooflight, and to provide access to other high points of the interior. These initial works cost more than £10 million, much of which was raised through donations via the [...] "Save Tyntesfield" [...] campaign and the sale of lottery tickets to visitors.|$|E
500|$|... "G.U.Y." [...] {{begins as}} Gaga rises {{again in a}} white dress, reborn as a Greek goddess of sorts and the song begins to play. Shots of Gaga in {{different}} outfits, including a blue dress and white bikini are shown with dance sequences. Andy Cohen and the stars of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills make cameos in the video. A scene featuring Gaga rolling around on a seashell bed in a red outfit, dancing in a gold leotard with arrows, and floating on a bed in a pool are shown throughout the song. With the help of YouTuber SkyDoesMinecraft (also making his cameo appearance), Michael Jackson, Mahatma Gandhi, John Lennon, and Jesus are resurrected using the game Minecraft and their blood is used to create clones known as [...] "G.U.Y." [...] Gaga, Vanderpump, and Richards are seen {{coming out of a}} car in black outfits, shooting money cannons, and walking down the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> kill corporate executives to replace with G.U.Y. clones.

500|$|Rachel informs Monica (Courteney Cox) {{that she}} has managed to find two male nurses who {{would be willing to}} go out on a date with either of them. Monica declines the offer at first, not wanting to {{jeopardize}} her secret relationship with Chandler (Matthew Perry) but when he assumes she is willing to go out with nurse Dan, Monica decides to date him after all. Chandler in response asks a female nurse {{to go out on a}} date with him; she declines immediately, adding to his embarrassment. After Phoebe gives birth, Chandler approaches Monica in a <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> ask if she is really going to date Dan. She replies to him that since both of them are just [...] "goofing around", she figured why not [...] "goof around" [...] with Dan too; Chandler asks if Monica had checked up the term in the dictionary, noting the technical definition is “two friends who care a lot about each other, and have amazing sex, and just want to spend more time together”. Monica, smitten by Chandler's words, kisses him and goes to call off her date with Dan.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Madonna and her dancers {{go from the}} <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> a bar where the singer forcefully makes Kortajarena drink a beverage, dry humps a dancer and {{continues}} dancing. The guest appearances start with Cyrus pointing her middle finger towards the camera wearing glitter around her eyes, followed by Wang, Diplo and Rocco in the bar, Beyoncé posing like Madonna's music video for [...] "Vogue" [...] (1990), Perry moving around to the song, and David dancing while Madonna and the others cheer him; all of them mouth the song name while they appear onscreen. As the chorus ends, a dancer brings a video screen behind them where Minaj appears rapping her part, interspersed by shots of West cheering. Madonna and her dancers continue moving through the room with falling confetti and reach a dance pole. She climbs {{through a set of}} dimly lit stairs and reaches the rooftop where the party is taking place. The song nears to an end and Madonna is shown surrounded by her dancers and some partygoers while she lies down; interspersed scenes show her twerking and dancing alone in a room wearing a cap with Hebrew word [...] "" [...] ("Shalom") written on it. The video ends with a far away shot of the Standard Hotel's brightly lit rooftop where the party continues.|$|E

Media in northern New Jersey and nearby New York City {{picked up on the}} report, and the Anti-Defamation League visited with the school superintendent on Thursday, May 21. School officials revealed in media reports that five students were suspended, although the school would not make it clear what, if any, involvement these students had had in the incidents. To protest against white supremacy and to promote racial equality, school students put up a banner in the <b>hallway,</b> <b>to</b> be signed by students who wanted racial tolerance and diversity.|$|E
2500|$|Jean Grey {{appears in}} The Super Hero Squad Show, voiced by Hynden Walch. In the episode [...] "Mysterious Mayhem at Mutant Academy", {{she is the}} only {{cheerleader}} at X-Men academy.

I'll rap you with a mental hurl, if you call me Marvel Girl! Go Mutants!), after she's done her cheer she uses the Phoenix Force and creates a heavy windstorm in the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> open the lockers and find a fractal while under Ringmaster's control. Oddly while the comic book cover intro for the episode shows Jean wearing a childlike version of her classic Phoenix costume, she wears a cheerleader uniform with a X-logo in the actual episode.

These included: the garden floor, the door and entrance foyer, the stairway, the <b>hallway</b> <b>to</b> the Cabinet Room, the Cabinet Room, the garden and terrace, the Small and Large State Rooms and the three reception rooms. The staircase, however, was rebuilt and simplified. Steel was hidden inside the columns in the Pillared Drawing Room to support the floor above. The upper floors were modernised and the 3rd floor extended over Numbers 11 and 12 to allow more living space. As many as 40 coats of paint were stripped from the elaborate cornices in the main rooms revealing details unseen for almost 200 years in some cases.|$|E
