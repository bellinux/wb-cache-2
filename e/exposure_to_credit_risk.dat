The paper is based on an analysis of results of the application of the linear regression model, during the period from the third quarter of 2008 to the third quarter of 2014. There are three main findings. Firstly, the higher lending activity of banks contributes to the increasing share of high-risk loans in the total withdrawn loans (delayed effect of 3 years).

40|$|Although most bank {{failures}} and banking problems historically have been attributable <b>to</b> poorly managed <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> <b>credit</b> <b>risk,</b> inadequate management of {{interest rate risk}} can give rise to {{the same types of}} problems, as illustrated by the U. S. 'savings and loan crisis' of the early 1990 s. Interest rate risk is one of the principal risks inherent in the maturity transformation activity of banks. Excessive or poorly managed <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> interest rate risk can menace both the financial balance of specific credit institutions and the overall stability of the financial system. The current environment of low interest rates, ongoing developments in regulatory and accounting standards, and the structural burden of the fixed-rate investment strategy of French banks – and of continental European banks in general – all combine <b>to</b> make <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> and management of interest-rate risk a leading concern of the different actors involved in ensuring financial stability. In this environment, prudential authorities, along with other authorities responsible for overall financial stability, need to have accurate indicators of levels and trends in <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> interest rate risk in the financial system. However, the diversity of this risk makes it very difficult to select such indicators. The choice depends heavily {{on the nature of the}} interest rate risk – in particular, on the volume of assets and liabilities containing embedded options –, on the financial structure of the specific institution, and on its overall strategy. This explains the diversity of practices observed today in the monitoring and management of interest rate risk. The same factors also make it extremely difficult to establish a harmonised system of quantitative reporting. As with other types of risk, the first line of defense against the vulnerabilities associated with interest rate risk is the soundness and robustness of internal management and control systems. The new capital framework envisages a tailored supervisory review. ...|$|R

The result shows a negative association between ownership concentration and risk. We also find that different categories of shareholders have different risk attitudes. Family-owned banks have incentives to take less risk. State-owned banks display higher risk and have significantly greater proportions of non-performing loans than other banks. By comparing conventional and Islamic banks, the empirical findings show that private Islamic banks are as stable as private conventional banks.

40|$|Credit risk is most simply {{defined as}} the {{potential}} that a borrower/counter party will fail to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed terms. The goal of credit risk management is to maintain credit risk exposure within targeted limits so that the bank can maximize risk adjusted return.

In order to prevent such situations, commercial banks must take certain measures of reducing credit risk. In order to assess the <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>credit</b> <b>risk,</b> we can operate with a system of indicators based on information obtained from financial statements.

Credit derivatives provide a way of gaining <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> alone, to the exclusion of interest rate risk. They also permit a relatively easy use of leverage. We examine two types of allocation : the first is a conventional investment in government bonds, corporate bonds (investment grade and high yield) and equities in the United States; the second replaces corporate bonds with credit derivatives, which may also be leveraged. We look at past data on returns, risk and correlations of these investments, and we show that the credit risk component seems to have a strongly diversifying effect relative to the traditional asset classes, i. e. equities and government bonds. We then compute efficient frontiers within a standard mean- variance framework. The results show the advantages of credit derivatives for portfolio diversification, and the usefulness of leveraging this investment to extend the limits of the efficient frontier.

40|$|The {{result of}} {{relatively}} recent financial innovations, collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) are securities that represent {{a portfolio of}} bank loans and/or different financial instruments. Part securitisation instrument part credit derivative, these increasingly-popular structured finance products are used by financial institutions for various purposes, ranging from reducing their cost of financing to exploiting arbitrage opportunities or transferring <b>credit</b> <b>risk.</b> Irrespective of their form, CDOs are issued in different tranches that are tailored using securitisation techniques. The process of tranching allows <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> and returns on their underlying portfolio to be redistributed to investors in an ad hoc fashion. CDOs {{are part of an}} ongoing trend of converting <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> into a marketable commodity. This process started with securitisation, and was then sustained by the development of credit ratings and corporate bond markets and, more recently, by that of credit derivatives. While CDO issuance represents at most the equivalent of a sixth of that of corporate bonds, the influence of these products has a far greater significance because of the amount of <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> they allow <b>to</b> be transferred. The sharp growth in synthetic structures backed by credit derivatives, especially in Europe, has heightened this trend. The rapid development of CDOs has improved non-bank investors’ access <b>to</b> <b>credit</b> markets and has enabled them to overcome the obstacles posed by the size and limited diversification of the corporate bond market, notably in Europe where bank intermediation remains predominant. Investors can now choose portfolios with specific risk-return profiles and take <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> previously confined <b>to</b> banks’ balance sheets, such as SME loans. Given that CDOs are <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> transfer instruments, they facilitate the redistribution of this risk within the financial and banking sector and even beyond, while increasing the degree of completeness of the credit market. They should therefore {{have a positive impact on}} financial stability. However, as is often the case with financial innovations, evaluating CDOs and the risks they entail, particularly in the case of Synthetic CDOs, requires the use of complex techniques that are not always sufficiently tried and tested. Both investors and market participants may thus be exposed to relatively high potential losses. At present, this risk does not appear to be of a systemic nature given the size and relative newness of the market. Nonetheless, if this market continues to grow at its current pace, attracting increasing numbers of investors, in particular in Europe where CDOs are predominantly synthetic, systemic risk may emerge. Moreover, growth in CDO issuance seems to have contributed to the marked narrowing of spreads over the past two years on all credit markets. This trend raises questions as to the links between the CDO market and the corporate bond and credit derivatives markets, and deserves particular attention with regard to the risk of the propagation and amplification of strains that may arise on the CDO market due to its still limited liquidity and transparency. ...|$|R

In particular, greater <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> <b>credit</b> and market <b>risk</b> {{are found to be}} key profit efficiency drivers.

The first-order conditions also allow us to identify the ‘cost-optimal’ directional vector for the banking DTDF, thus eliminating the uncertainty associated with an ad hoc choice of the direction. We apply our cost system approach to the data on large US commercial banks for the 2001 – 2010 period, which we estimate via Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods subject to theoretical regularity conditions.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the two leading types of proposals for {{reform of the}} housing finance system: (i) broad-based, explicit, priced government guarantees of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and (ii) privatization. Both proposals have drawbacks. Properly-priced guarantees would have little effect on mortgage interest rates relative <b>to</b> unguaranteed mortgage <b>credit</b> during normal times, and would expose taxpayers to moral-hazard risk with little benefit. Privatization reduces, but does not eliminate, the government’s <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> mortgage <b>credit</b> <b>risk.</b> It also leaves the economy and financial system exposed to destabilizing boom and bust cycles in mortgage credit. Based on this analysis, we argue that the main goal of housing finance reform should be financial stability, not the reduction of mortgage interest rates. To this end, we propose that the private market should be the main supplier of mortgage credit, but {{that it should be}} carefully regulated. This will require new approaches to regulating mortgage securitization. Moreover, we argue that while government guarantees of MBS have little value in normal times, they can be valuable in periods of significant stress to the financial system, such as in the recent financial crisis. Thus, we propose the creation of a government-owned corporation that would play the role of “guarantor-of-last-resort ” of newly-issued (not legacy) MBS during periods of crisis.

Following a brief summary {{of the development of}} the synthetic CDO market, I draw on recent innovations in modeling to present a pricing model for CDO tranches that does not require Monte Carlo simulation. I use the model to analyze the risk characteristics of the tranches of synthetic CDOs. The analysis shows that although the more junior CDO tranches [...] equity and mezzanine tranches [...] typically contain {{a small fraction of the}} notional amount of the CDO's reference portfolio, they bear a majority of the <b>credit</b> <b>risk.</b> One implication is that <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> disclosures relying on notional amounts are especially inadequate for firms that invest in CDOs. I show how the equity and mezzanine tranches can be viewed as leveraged <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> the underlying <b>credit</b> <b>risk</b> of the CDO's reference portfolio. Even though mezzanine tranches are typically rated investment-grade, the leverage they possess implies their risk (and expected return) can be many times that of an investment-grade corporate bond. The paper goes on to show how CDO tranches and other innovative credit products, such as single-tranche CDOs and first-to-default basket swaps, are sensitive to the correlation of defaults among the credits in the reference portfolio. Differences of opinion among market participants as to the correct default correlation can create trading opportunities. Finally, the paper shows how the dependence of CDO tranches on default correlation can also be characterized and measured as an <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> the business cycle, or as "business cycle risk. " A mezzanine tranche, in particular, is highly sensitive to business cycle risk. Risk...|$|R

The Greek financial sector appears largely sound and resilient to potential adverse shocks. The banking system is well capitalized and profitable, with adequate liquidity, but faces challenges arising from the recent rapid credit growth that increases bank <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> unfamiliar <b>credit</b> <b>risks.</b> Strategic and medium-term challenges include addressing legal and institutional impediments to improving competitiveness and developing new, cost-efficient sources of funding.
