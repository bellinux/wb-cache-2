2500|$|PSD senator Dan Șova is prosecuted since August 2014 {{for three}} offenses of {{complicity}} to abuse of office, with obtaining undue advantages for himself or for another, after in 2007–2008 his firm, [...] "Șova and Associates", concluded three contracts for legal aid with energy complexes Turceni and Rovinari, {{after which they}} would be prejudiced by nearly 3.5 million lei. In the same case are prosecuted Laurențiu Ciurel, director of Investment at Rovinari <b>Energy</b> <b>Complex</b> at the material time, and former general manager of Turceni <b>Energy</b> <b>Complex,</b> Dumitru Cristea, for abuse of office. Dan Șova is also investigated by the National Anticorruption Directorate {{in the case of}} illegal retrocession of forests, along with former PSD deputy Viorel Hrebenciuc and Victor Ponta's father-in-law, Ilie Sârbu. After a voting row, the Senate rejected on 2 June DNA request of retention and preventive arrest of Șova, being registered 66 votes [...] "for" [...] and 72 [...] "against". As of 5 June, Dan Șova is under judicial review. Moreover, he's not allowed to leave the country or communicate with Victor Ponta.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fossil fuels}} include coal, {{petroleum}} and natural gas. Bulgaria possesses significant reserves of coal estimated at 4,8 billion tons. More than 92% of them, or 4,5 billion tons, is lignite, {{which is the}} lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content but is widely used for electricity generation. With reserves of 2,856 billion tons Maritsa Iztok, situated in the Upper Thracian Plain, {{is by far the}} largest coal basin in the country which powers Maritsa Iztok Complex, the largest <b>energy</b> <b>complex</b> in South-Eastern Europe. Other lignite basins include Sofia valley (reserves of 870 million tons), Elhovo (656 million tons), Lom (277 million tons), Maritsa Zapad (170 million tons). The reserves of sub-bituminous coal are 300 million tons, situated mainly near Bobov Dol, Pernik and Burgas. The recoverable reserves of bituminous coal and anthracite are insignificant— only 10 and 2,5 million tons respectively. However, there is a huge basin of bituminous coal in Southern Dobruja with estimated reserves of over 1 billion tons but its large depth (1370–1950m) is an obstacle for its commercial exploitation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{interaction}} and electron transfer (ET) between rubredoxin (Rd) and rubredoxin: oxygen oxidoreductase (ROO) from Desulfovibrio gigas is studied by molecular modelling techniques. Experimental kinetic assays using recombinant proteins {{show that the}} Rd reoxidation by ROO displays a bell-shaped dependence on ionic strength, suggesting a non-trivial electrostatic dependence {{of the interaction between}} these two proteins. Rigid docking studies reveal a prevalence for Rd to interact, in a very specific way, with the surface of the ROO dimer near its FMN cofactors. The optimization of the lowest <b>energy</b> <b>complexes,</b> using molecular dynamics simulation, shows a very tight interaction between the surface of the two proteins, with a high probability for Rd residues (but not the iron centre directly) to be in direct contact with the FMN cofactors of ROO. Both electrostatics and van der Waals interactions contribute to the final <b>energy</b> of the <b>complex.</b> In these complexes, the major contributions for complex formation are polar interactions between acidic residues of Rd and basic residues of ROO, plus substantial non-polar interactions between different groups. Important residues for this process are identified. ET estimates (using the Pathways model), in the optimized lowest <b>energy</b> <b>complexes,</b> suggest that these configurations are efficient for transferring electrons. The experimental bell-shaped dependence of kinetics on ionic strength is analysed in view of the molecular modelling results, and hypotheses for the molecular basis of this phenomenon are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{tasks of}} the {{management}} of <b>energy</b> <b>complexes</b> are solved {{on the basis of}} information data about the condition and functioning of the <b>energy</b> <b>complexes.</b> Up to now more attention was paid to the energy production and transmission sector, less – to raising energy efficiency in the management systems. One of the main obstacles to wider introduction of the measures how to raise energy efficiency are the limited financial resources. Therefore it is essential to apply innovative management and financial mechanisms and schemes in this field. The aims of the conducted investigations were to study the methods how to raise the efficiency of the use of energy and to work out recommendations for their implementation under Latvian conditions because not only technical measures, for instance, the improvement and updating of the machinery, can be a cause for raising energy efficiency. Very often it can be achieved by introducing a correct energy efficiency management system. Consequently, not only huge sums must be invested to achieve such an effect. It is important to recognise that there are savings possible without great investments. In order to arrive at such a result, the main thing is to form a strategic approach to the management of energy consumption by joining various separate technical solutions of energy management...|$|R

In 1997, the Petroleum Investment Law was adopted, establishing a legal and regulatory framework, and liberalizing oil production. The key objectives of the law were the creation of the CNPE and the ANP, increased use of natural gas, increased competition in the energy market, and investments in power generation. The state monopoly of oil and gas exploration was ended, and energy subsidies were reduced.

40|$|We {{present an}} atomistic study carried out using density {{functional}} calculations including structural relaxations and Car–Parrinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD) simulations, aiming {{to investigate the}} structures of phenylalanine-copper (II) ([Phe-Cu] 2 +) complexes and their micro-solvation processes. The structures of the [Phe-Cu] 2 + complex with up to four water molecules are optimized using the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G** model in gas phase to identify the lowest energy structures at each degree of solvation (n = 0 – 4). It is found that the phenylalanine {{appears to be in}} the neutral form in isolated and mono-hydrated complexes, but in the zwitterionic form in other hydrated complexes (with n ≥ 2). The most stable structures of the complexes suggest that the Cu 2 +–π interactions are not dominant in the [Phe-Cu] 2 + complexes. The present CPMD simulations of the lowest energy micro-hydrated [Phe-Cu] 2 + complexes also reveal that the maximum coordination of Cu 2 + {{in the presence of the}} Phe ligand does not exceed four: the oxygen atoms from three water molecules and one carboxyl oxygen atom of Phe. Any excess water molecules will migrate to the second solvation shell. Moreover a unique structural motif, (N) H⋯O(3) ⋯H 2 O–Cu 2 + is present in the lowest <b>energy</b> <b>complexes,</b> which is recognized to be significant in stabilizing the structures of the complexes.
