5|$|The {{establishment}} of New Orleans in 1718 {{marked the beginning}} of the French colony of Louisiana.

5|$|A manor {{had existed}} at Ashby-de-la-Zouch {{from at least}} 1086, when the {{location}} was known as Ascebi. The lands were acquired by Robert de Beaumont, the Count of Meulan and later Earl of Leicester, in 1100. He established the Belmeis family there as his tenants and, after the Belmeis family line died out in 1160, the earls of Leicester reassigned the estate to the le Zouch family, <b>from</b> <b>whom</b> the manor took its later name.|$|E

5|$|According to Clan MacLeod tradition, Leod {{inherited}} {{some of his}} lands from {{a foster}} father, who was a sheriff of the Hebridean island of Skye; other lands he inherited from his father-in-law, {{who was also a}} lord on Skye. MacLeod tradition also states that Leod was the father of four sons and two daughters. Two of these sons founded the two main branches of MacLeods; branches which exist to this day—Tormod (<b>from</b> <b>whom</b> the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan descend) and Torquil (<b>from</b> <b>whom</b> the MacLeods of Lewis descend). The traditional belief that Torquil was a son has also been challenged; the current understanding is that he was a great-grandson of Leod. In recent years, the DNA evidence of men bearing surnames equating to MacLeod has revealed that a certain proportion share a common ancestor—an ancestor considered to have been the clan's founder.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{building}} and the institute take their name primarily from Master Morya, a non-corporeal spiritual leader <b>from</b> <b>whom</b> Helena Roerich received guidance via automatic writing. A secondary source of the name was Roerich himself who was revered as a theosophist master, able to interpret the wisdom of ancient gurus to modern man.|$|E

Kate informs Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) of all she knows about the Others and then leaves, saying she's going to get help to rescue Jack, but she won't say <b>from</b> <b>whom.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1809, {{the makeup}} of the {{legislature}} was altered again by Congress to a bicameral body. A House of Representatives was created and the representation was apportioned by population. The House was then to choose ten candidates <b>from</b> <b>whom</b> the President, through the governor, would choose five to form a council which served as the upper house of the legislature. Thereafter, the structure of the legislature remained unchanged {{for the remainder of the}} territory's existence.|$|E

5|$|In 1874, when Horatio was 14 and due {{to leave}} the orphanage, he ran away without waiting for the formalities. His aunt Caroline Praill—his mother's sister—who lived in nearby Edgbaston, gave him a home, while he worked as an errand boy in a Birmingham {{building}} firm.

5|$|Some Canadian and British {{infantry}} divisions {{had been}} temporarily equipped with M7 Priest self-propelled guns for the D-Day landings, {{which had been}} replaced by towed 25-Pounder field guns.

Permission was first requested from the Americans, <b>from</b> <b>whom</b> the M7s had been borrowed, to convert them into APCs.|$|E
5|$|The Historia Brittonum {{says that}} Pybba had 12 sons, {{including}} Penda, but that Penda and Eowa of Mercia were those best known to its author. (Many of these 12 sons of Pybba {{may in fact}} merely represent later attempts to claim descent from him.) Besides Eowa, the pedigrees also give Penda a brother named Coenwalh <b>from</b> <b>whom</b> two later kings were said to descend, although this may instead represent his brother-in-law Cenwalh of Wessex.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{its natural}} {{strategic}} {{position on a}} small peninsula into the Mediterranean Sea below the Taurus Mountains, Alanya has been a local stronghold for many Mediterranean-based empires, including the Ptolemaic, Seleucid, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires. Alanya's greatest political importance came in the Middle Ages, with the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm {{under the rule of}} Alaeddin Kayqubad I, <b>from</b> <b>whom</b> the city derives its name. His building campaign resulted in many of the city's landmarks, such as the Kızıl Kule (Red Tower), Tersane (Shipyard), and Alanya Castle.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{an aristocratic}} Bengali family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was {{inclined}} towards spirituality. He {{was influenced by}} his Guru, Ramakrishna Deva, <b>from</b> <b>whom</b> he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to mankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds {{of public and private}} lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the United States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a patriotic saint and his birthday is celebrated there as National Youth Day.|$|E
