We have an ovum practically free from yolk (alecithal), and, therefore, we find it dividing completely and almost equally. We naturally assume, from what we have learnt, that the next stages will be {{the formation of a}} hollow blastosphere, invagination, a gastrula forming mesoblast by hollow outgrowths from the archenteron, and so on. There is no yolk here to substitute <b>epiboly</b> (Section 9) for invagination, nor to obliterate the archenteron and the blastopore through its pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Completion of <b>epiboly</b> {{requires}} {{the coordination of}} cytoskeletal changes across the embryo. The YSL appears to play {{a prominent role in}} this process. Studies on Fundulus demonstrated that the YSL is capable of undergoing <b>epiboly</b> even when the blastoderm has been removed, but that the blastoderm cannot undergo <b>epiboly</b> {{in the absence of the}} YSL. In zebrafish, there is a microtubule array in the yolk that extends from the animal to the vegetal pole of the embryo, and that contracts as <b>epiboly</b> progresses. Treating embryos with the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole completely blocks <b>epiboly</b> of the YSL and partially blocks <b>epiboly</b> of the blastoderm, while treating with the microtubule stabilizing agent taxol blocks <b>epiboly</b> of all cell layers. There is also evidence for the importance of actin-based structures in <b>epiboly.</b> Ring-like structures of filamentous actin have been observed at the leading edge of the enveloping layer, where it contacts the yolk cell. It is thought that a network of filamentous actin in the yolk might constrict in a myosin-II dependent manner to close the blastopore at the end of <b>epiboly,</b> via a [...] "purse-string mechanism". Treating embryos with the actin destabilizer cytochalasin b results in delayed or arrested <b>epiboly.</b>|$|E

Comparisons of <b>epiboly</b> in amniotes, teleosts and X. laevis show that the key movement of <b>epiboly</b> in the fish and frog is radial intercalation while in amniotes it would appear to be cell division in the plane of the epithelium. All groups undergo cell shape changes such as the characteristic flattening of cells to increase surface area.|$|E

50|$|<b>Epiboly</b> is a cell {{movement}} {{that occurs in}} the early embryo, {{at the same time}} as gastrulation. It is one of many movements in the early embryo that allow for dramatic physical restructuring (see morphogenesis). The movement is generally characterized as being a thinning and spreading of cell layers. <b>Epiboly</b> has been most extensively studied in zebrafish as their development allows for an easy visualization of the process.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Epiboly</b> in {{zebrafish}} is {{the first}} coordinated cell movement, and begins once the embryo has completed the blastula stage. At this point the zebrafish embryo contains three portions, an epithelial monolayer known as the enveloping layer (EVL), a yolk syncytial layer (YSL) which is a membrane-enclosed group of nuclei that lie {{on top of the}} yolk cell, and the deep cells (DEL) of the blastoderm which will eventually form the embryo's three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). The EVL, YSL, and DEL all undergo <b>epiboly.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{gastrulation}} patterns exhibit enormous variation {{throughout the}} animal kingdom, they are unified by the five basic types of cell movements that occur during gastrulation: 1) invagination 2) involution 3) ingression 4) delamination 5) <b>epiboly.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{is still}} {{debate on the}} extent to which the DEL and EVL epibolic {{movements}} are active movements. The EVL contacts the YSL by means of tight junctions. It is thought that these contacts allow the YSL to [...] "tow" [...] the EVL towards the vegetal pole. Claudin E is a molecule found in tight junctions that appears to be expressed in the EVL and required for normal zebrafish <b>epiboly,</b> supporting this hypothesis. Additionally, zebrafish embryos that fail to make a fully differentiated EVL show defects in epibolic movements of the DEL, EVL, and YSL, suggesting a requirement for a normal EVL for the <b>epiboly</b> of all three cell layers.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecule}} fibronectin {{has been}} found {{to play a role in}} radial intercalation. Other signaling pathways that appear to function in <b>epiboly</b> include the Wnt/PCP pathway, PDGF-PI3K pathway, Eph-Ephrin signaling, Jak-Stat signaling, and the MAP kinase cascade.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to defining asymmetric axes {{in the adult}} organism, cell polarity also regulates both individual and collective cell movements during embryonic development such as apical constriction, invagination, and <b>epiboly.</b> These movements are critical for shaping the embryo and creating the complex structures of the adult body.|$|E
50|$|Yolk plug is the {{remaining}} patch of endodermal cells that is created during {{the formation of}} the dorsal lip of the blastopore. It is a patch of large endodermal cells which remains exposed on the vegetal surface of the amphibian blastula that will eventually be internalized by <b>epiboly.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Radial {{intercalation}} {{occurs in}} the DEL. Interior cells of the blastoderm move towards the outer cells, thus [...] "intercalating" [...] with each other. The blastoderm begins to thin as it spreads toward the vegetal pole of the embryo until it has completely engulfed the yolk cell. The EVL also moves vegetally during <b>epiboly,</b> increasing its surface area as it spreads. Work in the ray-finned fish Fundulus has shown that no large rearrangements occur in the EVL; instead, cells {{at the leading edge}} of the EVL align and constrict. The YSL also moves towards the vegetal pole, spreading along the surface of the yolk and migrating slightly ahead of the blastomeres. Once <b>epiboly</b> is complete, the DEL, EVL, and YSL have engulfed the yolk cell, forming a closure known as the blastopore.|$|E
50|$|The cell-cell {{adhesion}} molecule E-cadherin {{has been shown}} to be required for the radial intercalation of the deep cells. Many other molecules involved in cell-cell contact are implicated in zebrafish <b>epiboly,</b> including G alpha (12/13) which interacts with E-Cadherin and actin, as well as the cell adhesion molecule EpCam in the EVL, which may modulate adhesion with the underlying deep cells.|$|E

These {{differences between the two}} groups suggest no definite relationship between them. These two groups of animals might have originated from a remote ancestral stock. The annelidan aflffmities of Balanoglossus have, therefore, been given up.|$|E
50|$|Once {{blastoderm}} {{cells have}} covered {{almost half of}} the yolk cell, thickening throughout the margin of deep cells occurs. The thickening {{is referred to as the}} germ ring and is made up of a superficial layer, the epiblast which will become ectoderm, and an inner layer called the hypoblast which will become endoderm and mesoderm. As the blastoderm cells undergo <b>epiboly</b> around the yolk the internalization of cells at the blastoderm margin start to form hypoblast. Presumpive ectoderm or epiblast cells do not interalize but the deep cells (inner layer of cells) do and they become the mesoderm and endoderm. As the hypoblast cells move inward future mesoderm (hypoblast cells) start to move vegetally and proliferate but later in development these cells alter their direction and start moving towards the animal pole. However, endodermal precursors seem to lack a pattern and move randomly over the yolk.|$|E
50|$|During {{the process}} of gastrulation, a special type of cells called bottle cells invaginates a hole {{on the surface of}} the blastula which is called the dorsal lip of the blastopore. Once this lip has been established, the bottle cells will extend inward and migrate along the inner wall of the blastula known as the roof of the blastocoel. The once {{superficial}} cells of the animal pole are destined to become the cells of the middle germ layer called the mesoderm. Through {{the process of}} radial extension, cells of the animal pole that were once several layers thick divide to from a thin layer. At the same time, when this thin layer of dividing cells reaches the dorsal lip of the blastopore, another process occurs termed convergent extension. During convergent extension, cells that approach the lip intercalate mediolaterally, in such a way that cells are pulled over the lip and inside the embryo. These two processes allow for the prospective mesoderm cells to be placed between the ectoderm and the endoderm. Once convergent extension and radial intercalation are underway, the rest of the vegetal pole, which will become endoderm cells, is completely engulfed by the prospective ectoderm, as these top cells undergo <b>epiboly,</b> where the ectoderm cells divide in a way to form one layer. This creates a uniform embryo composed of the three germ layers in their respective positions.|$|E
50|$|Gastrulation in {{amphibians}} is {{initiated by}} formation of bottle cells at the dorsal marginal zone, followed by involution of prospective mesodermal cells. The mesoderm and endoderm then migrate animally along the blastocoel roof, driven {{in part by}} movement of the vegetal endoderm cells. In Xenopus embryos in which the blastocoel roof is removed prior to gastrulation, the movement of vegetal cells toward the blastocoel and their intercalation into the blastocoel floor causes the floor to spread, pushing the dorsal edge downward. In {{the context of the}} embryo, active vegetal rotation, together with <b>epiboly</b> of the animal cap ectodermal cells, appears to bring the vegetal mesendoderm into contact with the blastocoel roof. This movement results in formation of Brachet’s cleft. As gastrulation continues, further spreading of the blastocoel floor by upward movement of vegetal cells contributes to the advancement of the mesendoderm along the blastocoel roof. This process is aided by crawling mesodermal cells at {{the leading edge of the}} mesendoderm. Much like bottle cell formation at the blastopore lip, vegetal rotation begins at the dorsal side of the embryo, and spreads laterally to the ventral side. These processes, however, occur independently. While vegetal rotation appears to be important prior to and in the early stages of gastrulation, by stages 10.5 - 11, vegetal rotation ceases and further involution appears to be driven primarily by cell rearrangements.|$|E
50|$|The first visible {{stage of}} {{gastrulation}} {{is the creation}} of a concavity on the dorsal side, right under the gray crescent. In this place begins the infiltration of cells of the future mesoderm. From this moment the embryo is called a gastrula, and the concave, visible from outside, is the emerging blastopore. Over the upper edge of the blastopore, called the dorsal lip, a migration of cells occurs, which derive from the central area of the gray crescent. The process of involution takes place - the dorsal lip turns in upon itself. The moving cells enter the blastocoele. As the blastopore deepens, a new embryonic cavity develops, the primitive gut, or the archenteron. It grows in length towards the future front part of the embryo. It can be seen from outside the embryo that the dorsal lip curves itself and grows, creating the side lips of the blastopore. During this time, the paraxial mesoderm enters the embryo. It will change into somitomeres. The bottom of the archenteron is composed of macromeres. They later transform into the gut of the embryo. The ventral lip of the blastopore develops, and the lateral plate mesoderm enters the blastocoel through it. The blastopore develops a ring-like shape, and surrounds the macromeres, creating the yolk sac. The process of involution occurs simultaneously with the process of <b>epiboly,</b> a cell movement associated with the covering of the embryo by the ectoderm. The blastopore gradually closes, and the macromeres, which are endodermal cells, are pulled inside of the embryo (the process of emboly). It {{can be seen from the}} outside as the shrinking of the yolk sac. Near the end of gastrulation, the yolk sac becomes entirely covered by the ectoderm, and the blastopore assumes the shape of a vertical cleavage. The three germ layers form a characteristic shape. The ectoderm is the outermost layer, the mesoderm is the middle one, and the endoderm forms the inside layer. Only in the locations of the future body openings (the mouth and the anus), the endoderm remains in immediate contact with the ectoderm.In the next stage of development, which is known as neurulation, the embryo grows in length in the anterior-posterior axis. The differentiation of the germ layers also occurs.|$|E
30|$|The {{expansion}} of blastoderm and slow peristaltic {{movement of the}} cellular perivitelline fluid were noticed. This is the commencement of <b>epiboly</b> - that is the very slowly morphogenetic peristaltic cellular movement. This movement involves more or less contraction and {{expansion of}} the blastoderm. The movement later increased gradually and consistently. At about 50 % <b>epiboly</b> (Figure  2 N), there was the definitive germ ring (Figure  2 O) evident around the blastoderm. The embryonic shield was discernible with thickness of the chorionic/perivitelline capsule (Figure  2 P). The characteristic cellular inward movement continued (Figure  2 Q) until the blastopore was closed marking the end of <b>epiboly</b> and/or gastrulation. Prior to the completion of <b>epiboly</b> was the protrusion of yolk cell beyond the blastoderm margin {{referred to as the}} yolk plug (Figure  2 R). Tail bud was noticed forming at 95 % <b>epiboly</b> (Figure  2 R); and there was eventually a completed <b>epiboly</b> (Figure  2 S) revealing the polster and the tail bud. This stage was highly characterized with offensive odour.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{earliest}} morphogenetic processes {{in the development of}} many animals is <b>epiboly.</b> In the zebrafish, <b>epiboly</b> ensues when the animally localized blastoderm cells spread, thin over, and enclose the vegetally localized yolk. Only a few factors are known to function in this fundamental process. We identified a maternal-effect mutant, betty boop (bbp), which displays a novel defect in <b>epiboly,</b> wherein the blastoderm margin constricts dramatically, precisely when half of the yolk cell is covered by the blastoderm, causing the yolk cell to burst. Whole-blastoderm transplants and mRNA microinjection rescue demonstrate that Bbp functions in the yolk cell to regulate <b>epiboly.</b> We positionally cloned the maternal-effect bbp mutant gene and identified it as the zebrafish homolog of the serine-threonine kinase Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Activated Protein Kinase 2, or MAPKAPK 2, which was not previously known to function in embryonic development. We show that the regulation of MAPKAPK 2 is conserved and p 38 MAP kinase functions upstream of MAPKAPK 2 in regulating <b>epiboly</b> in the zebrafish embryo. Dramatic alterations in calcium dynamics, together with the massive marginal constrictive force observed in bbp mutants, indicate precocious constriction of an F-actin network within the yolk cell, which first forms at 50 % <b>epiboly</b> and regulates <b>epiboly</b> progression. We show that MAPKAPK 2 activity and its regulator p 38 MAPK function in the yolk cell to regulate the process of <b>epiboly,</b> identifying a new pathway regulating this cell movement process.

40|$|<b>Epiboly,</b> {{the process}} by which the animally-localized {{blastoderm}} spreads vegetally to encapsulate the yolk, is not well understood. Proteins and processes that contribute to <b>epiboly</b> are beginning to be identified and studied both in the zebrafish and other model systems. The maternal-effect mutant betty boop provides a tool for understanding force generation and cell movements that allow the blastoderm to migrate over the yolk during <b>epiboly.</b> betty boop embryos develop normally until 50 % <b>epiboly</b> when the blastoderm margin constricts, causing the yolk to burst, killing the embryo. betty boop embryos were analyzed with regard to the known factors contributing to the <b>epiboly</b> process. Patterning occurs normally in betty boop embryos, consistent with the defect being strictly in the morphogenesis of the early embryo. The bursting of the yolk can be quasi-rescued by incubating mutant embryos in hyperosmotic solution allowing the healed gastrula to continue to develop, suggesting that mutant cells are competent to undergo gastrulation and convergence/extension movements. Actin and microtubule networks form, and endocytosis begins properly in the syncytial layer of the yolk, suggesting that these aspects of <b>epiboly</b> are properly set up prior to the <b>epiboly</b> defect. Chromosomal mapping of the betty boop mutation, followed by positional cloning, identified a nonsense base change that truncates the protein MAPKAPK 2, a target of the p 38 /MAP kinase pathway. The 33 amino acid truncation removes a nuclear localization signal and carboxy-terminal amino acids that not only affects subcellular localization of the protein, but also catalytic function.

40|$|Summary <b>Epiboly</b> is {{the first}} coordinated cell {{movement}} in most vertebrates and marks the onset of gastrulation. During zebrafish <b>epiboly,</b> enveloping layer (EVL) and deep cells spread over the vegetal yolk mass with a concomitant thinning of the deep cell layer. A prevailing model suggests that deep cell radial intercalations directed towards the EVL would drive deep cell <b>epiboly.</b> To test this model, we have globally recorded 3 D cell trajectories for zebrafish blastomeres between sphere and 50 % <b>epiboly</b> stages, and developed an image analysis framework to determine intercalation events, intercalation directionality, and migration speed for cells at specific positions within the embryo. This framework uses Voronoi diagrams to compute cell-to-cell contact areas, defines a feature-based spatio-temporal model for intercalation events and fits an anatomical coordinate system to the recorded datasets. We further investigate whether <b>epiboly</b> defects in MZspg mutant embryos devoid of Pou 5 f 1 /Oct 4 {{may be caused by}} changes in intercalation behavior. In wild-type and mutant embryos, intercalations orthogonal to the EVL occur with no directional bias towards or away from the EVL, suggesting that there are no directional cues that would direct intercalations towards the EVL. Further, we find that intercalation direction is independent of the previous intercalation history of individual deep cells, arguing against cues that would program specific intrinsic directed migration behaviors. Our data support a dynamic model in which deep cells during <b>epiboly</b> migrate into space opening between the EVL and the yolk syncytial layer. Genetic programs determining cell motility may control deep cell dynamic behavior and <b>epiboly</b> progress...|$|E
40|$|Summary Fetal alcohol {{spectrum}} disorder (FASD) {{occurs when}} pregnant mothers consume alcohol, causing embryonic ethanol exposure and characteristic birth defects that include craniofacial, neural and cardiac defects. Gastrulation {{is a particularly}} sensitive developmental stage for teratogen exposure, and zebrafish is an outstanding model to study gastrulation and FASD. <b>Epiboly</b> (spreading blastomere cells over the yolk cell), prechordal plate migration and convergence/extension cell movements are sensitive to early ethanol exposure. Here, experiments are presented that characterize mechanisms of ethanol toxicity on <b>epiboly</b> and gastrulation. <b>Epiboly</b> mechanisms include blastomere radial intercalation cell movements and yolk cell microtubule cytoskeleton pulling the embryo to the vegetal pole. Both of these processes were disrupted by ethanol exposure. Ethanol effects on cell migration also indicated that cell adhesion was affected, which was confirmed by cell aggregation assays. E-cadherin cell adhesion molecule expression was not affected by ethanol exposure, but E-cadherin distribution, which controls <b>epiboly</b> and gastrulation, was changed. E-cadherin was redistributed into cytoplasmic aggregates in blastomeres and dramatically redistributed in the extraembryonic yolk cell. Gene expression microarray {{analysis was used to}} identify potential causative factors for early development defects, and expression of the cell adhesion molecule protocadherin- 18 a (pcdh 18 a), which controls <b>epiboly,</b> was significantly reduced in ethanol exposed embryos. Injecting pcdh 18 a synthetic mRNA in ethanol treated embryos partially rescued <b>epiboly</b> cell movements, including enveloping layer cell shape changes. Together, data show that <b>epiboly</b> and gastrulation defects induced by ethanol are multifactorial, and include yolk cell (extraembryonic tissue) microtubule cytoskeleton disruption and blastomere adhesion defects, in part caused by reduced pcdh 18 a expression...|$|E
40|$|We report that, during <b>epiboly</b> in zebrafish, three F-actin-based {{structures}} appear {{only after}} the blastoderm migrates past the embryonic equator.

40|$|AbstractThe T-box {{transcription}} factor Eomesodermin (Eomes) has {{been implicated in}} patterning and morphogenesis in frog, fish and mouse.

Here we report {{for the first time the}} identification and characterization of an Eomesa mutant generated by TILLING. We find that Eomesa has a strictly maternal role in the initiation of <b>epiboly,</b> which involves doming of the yolk cell up into the overlying blastoderm. By contrast, <b>epiboly</b> progression is normal, demonstrating for the first time that <b>epiboly</b> initiation is genetically separable from progression. The yolk cell microtubules, which are required for <b>epiboly,</b> are defective in maternal-zygotic eomesa mutant embryos. In addition, the deep cells of the blastoderm are more tightly packed and exhibit more bleb-like protrusions than cells in control embryos. We postulate that the doming delay may be the consequence both of overly stabilized yolk cell microtubules and defects in the adhesive properties or motility of deep cells.

40|$|AbstractEpiboly, {{the first}} {{morphogenetic}} cell movement {{that occurs in}} the zebrafish embryo, is {{the process by which}} the blastoderm thins and spreads to engulf the yolk cell. This process requires the concerted actions of the deep cells, the enveloping layer (EVL) and the extra-embryonic yolk syncytial layer (YSL). The EVL is mechanically coupled to the YSL which acts as an <b>epiboly</b> motor, generating the force necessary to draw the blastoderm towards the vegetal pole though actomyosin flow and contraction of the actomyosin ring. However, it has been proposed that the endocytic removal of yolk cell membrane just ahead of the advancing blastoderm may also play a role. To assess the contribution of yolk cell endocytosis in driving <b>epiboly</b> movements, we used a combination of drug- and dominant-negative-based approaches to inhibit Dynamin, a large GTPase with a well-characterized role in vesicle scission. We show that Dynamin-dependent endocytosis in the yolk cell is dispensable for <b>epiboly</b> of the blastoderm. However, global inhibition of Dynamin function revealed that Dynamin plays a fundamental role within the blastoderm during <b>epiboly,</b> where it maintains epithelial integrity and the transmission of tension across the EVL. The epithelial defects were associated with disrupted tight junctions and a striking reduction of cortically localized phosphorylated ezrin/radixin/moesin (P-ERM), key regulators of epithelial integrity in other systems. Furthermore, we show that Dynamin maintains EVL and promotes <b>epiboly</b> progression by antagonizing Rho A activity...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEarly morphogenic {{movements}} {{are an important}} feature of embryonic development in vertebrates.

At the molecular level, the Nrz protein controls the actin-myosin dynamics through IP 3 R-dependent calcium levels variation.

40|$|The {{basic body}} plan of teleost embryos emerges during the {{gastrula}} period when {{a series of}} extensive cell movements and rearrangements - <b>epiboly,</b> involution, convergence and extension - lead {{to the formation of}} the three germ layers as well as the dorsoventral and anterioposterior body axes. Starting {{towards the end of the}} blastula period, <b>epiboly</b> consists of the thinning and spreading of both the blastoderm and the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) over the large (~ 600 μm diameter) yolk cell toward the vegetal pole until, by the end of the gastrula period, the yolk is completed encompassed. The characterisation of microfilaments in zebrafish embryos from the earliest stages of development to around 50 % <b>epiboly</b> has been previously described, thus the goal of my project was to complete this study up until the end of <b>epiboly.</b> Here in my thesis, I described four striking new actin-based structures: a punctate actin band in the external yolk syncytial layer (E-YSL); continuous rings of actin at the leading margins of both the enveloping layer (EVL) cells and deep cells (DCs); as well as a dense actin mat located at the vegetal pole (VP). Of these four structures, only one, the vegetal actin mat, is present throughout <b>epiboly.</b> The other three, the punctate actin band and the two marginal actin rings, only appear after the equator of the yolk cell has been crossed by the spreading blastoderm layers. It is suggested, therefore, that these structures are specific for the second half of <b>epiboly</b> and appear in response to the changing geometry of the embryo with respect to the spreading cell layers. With regards to function, the punctate actin band appears to be associated with a region of macropinocytosis that acts to internalise the yolk cell membrane (YCM) in front of the advancing blastoderm margins. It is proposed that this actin-based contractile activity also generates force that helps to draw the E-YSL and attached EVL toward the VP. It is suggested that the EVL and DC marginal actin rings act as contractile purse-strings and thus help to bring together the margins of the EVL and DCs as they approach the VP. Finally, it is proposed that the vegetal actin mat acts as major component of the yolk cell cytoskeleton, maintaining structural integrity during <b>epiboly.</b> I also present evidence to show that Ca 2 + may play a key role in the formation and function of these actin-based structures. Treatment with the Ca 2 + chelator dibromo-BAPTA (DBB) results in the disruption of the various actin-based structures and leads to the slowing or immediate arrest of <b>epiboly,</b> resulting in a failure of yolk cell occlusion followed by the eventual lysis of the embryo through the vegetal pole region. I also present data whereby embryos were loaded with f-aequorin (a Ca 2 +-sensitive bioluminescent reporter) at the single cell stage and then treated with either cytochalasin B or DBB during <b>epiboly</b> and the resulting Ca 2 + signalling patterns visualised using a Photon Imaging Microscope system.

40|$|<b>Epiboly,</b> the {{spreading}} and the thinning of the blastoderm {{to cover the}} yolk cell and close the blastopore in fish embryos, {{is central to the}} process of gastrulation. Despite its fundamental importance, {{little is known about the}} molecular mechanisms that control this coordinated cell movement. By a combination of knockdown studies and rescue experiments in zebrafish (Danio rerio), we show that <b>epiboly</b> relies on the molecular networking of syntenin with syndecan heparan sulphate proteoglycans, which act as co-receptors for adhesion molecules and growth factors. Furthermore, we show that the interaction of syntenin with phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) and with the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf 6), which regulate the endocytic recycling of syndecan, is necessary for <b>epiboly</b> progression. Analysis of the earliest cellular defects suggests a role for syntenin in the autonomous vegetal expansion of the yolk syncytial layer and the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in extra-embryonic tissues, but not in embryonic cell fate determination.

In {{the last couple of}} decades, most studies of <b>epiboly</b> have utilized Xenopus or zebrafish as genetically tractable model organisms, while the avian <b>epiboly</b> model has received virtually no attention. Here, we re-visit <b>epiboly</b> in quail embryos and characterize several molecular markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the inner zone of the extraembryonic Area Opaca and at the blastoderm edge. Our results show that the intermediate filament vimentin, a widely-used marker of the mesenchymal phenotype, is strongly expressed in the edge cells compared to the cells in the inner zone, and that <b>epiboly</b> is inhibited when embryos are treated with Withaferin-A, a vimentin-targeting drug. Laminin, an extracellular matrix protein that is a major structural and adhesive component of the epiblast basement membrane, is notably absent from the blastoderm edge, and shows three distinct morphological regions approaching the leading edge. While these expression profiles are consistent with a mesenchymal phenotype, several other epithelial markers, including cytokeratin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin, were present in the blastoderm edge cells. Moreover, the results of a BrDU proliferation assay suggest that expansion of the edge cell population is primarily due to recruitment of cells from the inner zone, and not proliferation. Taken together, our data suggest that the edge cells of the avian blastoderm have characteristics of both epithelial and mesenchymal cells, and could serve as an in-vivo model for cancer and wound healing studies.

40|$|<b>Epiboly,</b> the {{enveloping}} of the yolk cell by the blastoderm, is {{the first}} zebrafish morphogenetic movement, We isolated four mutations that affect epiboly: half baked, avalanche, lawine and weg, Homozygous mutant embryos arrest the vegetal progress of the deep cells of the blastoderm; only the yolk syncytial layer of the yolk cell and the enveloping layer of the blastoderm reach the vegetal pole of the embryo, The mutations half baked, avalanche and lawine produce a novel dominant effect, termed a zygotic-maternal dominant effect: heterozygous embryos produced from heterozygous females slow down <b>epiboly</b> and accumulate detached cells over the neural tube; {{a small fraction of}} these mutant individuals are viable, Heterozygous embryos produced from heterozygous males crossed to homozygous wild-type females complete <b>epiboly</b> normally and are completely viable. Additionally, embryos heterozygous for half baked have an enlarged hatching gland, a partial dominant phenotype, The phenotypes of these mutants demonstrate that, for the spreading of cells during <b>epiboly,</b> the movement of the deep cells of the blastoderm require the function of genes that are not necessary for the movement of the enveloping layer or the yolk cell, Furthermore, the dominant zygotic-maternal effect phenotypes illustrate the maternal and zygotic interplay of genes that orchestrate the early cell movements of the zebrafish...|$|E
40|$|<b>Epiboly</b> spreads and thins the {{blastoderm}} {{over the}} yolk cell during zebrafish gastrulation, and involves coordinated movements of several cell layers. Although {{recent studies have}} begun to elucidate the processes that underlie these epibolic movements, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved remain to be fully defined. Here, we show that gastrulae with altered Gα 12 / 13 signaling display delayed epibolic movement of the deep cells, abnormal movement of dorsal forerunner cells, and dissociation of cells from the blastoderm, phenocopying e-cadherin mutants. Biochemical and genetic studies indicate that Gα 12 / 13 regulate <b>epiboly,</b> in part by associating with the cytoplasmic terminus of E-cadherin, and thereby inhibiting E-cadherin activity and cell adhesion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Gα 12 / 13 modulate epibolic movements of the enveloping layer by regulating actin cytoskeleton organization through a RhoGEF/Rho-dependent pathway. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that Gα 12 / 13 regulate <b>epiboly</b> through two distinct mechanisms: limiting E-cadherin activity and modulating {{the organization of the}} actin cytoskeleton...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMembers of the Bcl- 2 protein family {{regulate}} {{mitochondrial membrane}} permeability and also localize to the endoplasmic reticulum where they control Ca(2 +) homeostasis by interacting with inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) receptors (IP 3 Rs). In zebrafish, Bcl- 2 -like 10 (Nrz) {{is required for}} Ca(2 +) signaling during <b>epiboly</b> and gastrulation. We characterized the mechanism by which Nrz controls IP 3 -mediated Ca(2 +) release during this process. We showed that Nrz was phosphorylated during early <b>epiboly,</b> and that in embryos in which Nrz was knocked down, reconstitution with Nrz bearing mutations designed to prevent its phosphorylation disrupted cyclic Ca(2 +) transients and the assembly of the actin-myosin ring and led to <b>epiboly</b> arrest. In cultured cells, wild-type Nrz, but not Nrz with phosphomimetic mutations, interacted with the IP 3 binding domain of IP 3 R 1, inhibited binding of IP 3 to IP 3 R 1, and prevented histamine-induced increases in cytosolic Ca(2 +). Collectively, {{these data suggest that}} Nrz phosphorylation is necessary for the generation of IP 3 -mediated Ca(2 +) transients and the formation of circumferential actin-myosin cables required for <b>epiboly.</b> Thus, in addition to their role in apoptosis, by tightly regulating Ca(2 +) signaling, Bcl- 2 family members participate in the cellular events associated with early vertebrate development, including cytoskeletal dynamics and cell movement...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDynamic {{cytoskeleton}} {{organization is}} essential for polarized cell behaviours {{in a wide variety}} of morphogenetic events. In zebrafish, <b>epiboly</b> involves coordinated cell shape changes and expansion of cell layers to close the blastopore, but many important regulatory aspects are still unclear. Especially, the spatio-temporal regulation and function of actin structures remain to be determined for a better understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate <b>epiboly</b> movement. Here we show that Rac 1 signalling, likely functions downstream of phosphatiditylinositol- 3 kinase, is required for F-actin organization during <b>epiboly</b> progression in zebtafish. Using a dominant negative mutant of Rac 1 and specific inhibitors to block the activation of this pathway, we find that marginal contractile actin ring is sensitive to inhibition of Rac 1 signalling. In particular, we identify a novel function for this actin structure in retaining the external yolk syncytial nuclei within the margin of enveloping layer for coordinated movement toward the vegetal pole. Furthermore, we find that F-actin bundles, progressively formed in the vegetal cortex of the yolk cell, act in concert with marginal actin ring and play an active role in pulling external yolk syncytial nuclei toward the vegetal pole direction. This study uncovers novel roles of different actin structures in orchestrating <b>epiboly</b> movement. It helps to provide insight into the mechanisms regulating cellular polarization during early development...|$|E
