We find that under optimal operation, buses provide lower waiting time and operator costs, therefore the only possible advantage for rail is providing a lower in-vehicle time cost if trains are faster. Using Australian data, we found that bus rapid transit provides a lower total cost, higher profit and welfare, up to their capacity.

40|$|Microeconomic {{optimisation}} of scheduled {{public transport}} operations has traditionally focused on finding optimal {{values for the}} frequency of service, capacity of vehicles, number of lines and distance between stops. In addition, however, there exist other elements in the system that present a trade-off between the interests of users and operators that have not received attention in the literature, such as the optimal selection of a fare payment system and a designed running speed (i. e., the cruising speed that buses maintain in between two consecutive stops). Alternative fare payment methods (e. g., on-board and off-board, payment by cash, magnetic strip or smart card) have different boarding times and capital costs, with the more efficient systems such as a contactless smart card imposing higher amounts of capital investment. Based on empirical data from several Bus Rapid Transit systems around the world, we also find {{that there is a}} positive relationship between infrastructure cost per kilometre and commercial speed (including stops), achieved by the buses, which we further postulate as a linear relationship between infrastructure investment and running speed. Given this context, we develop a microeconomic model for the operation of a bus corridor that minimises total cost (users and operator) and has five decision variables: frequency, capacity of vehicles, station spacing, fare payment system and running speed, thus extending the traditional framework. Congestion, induced by bus frequency, {{plays an important role in}} the design of the system, as queues develop behind high <b>demand</b> <b>bus</b> stops when the frequency is high. We show that (i) an off-board fare payment system is the most cost effective in the majority of circumstances; (ii) bus congestion results in decreased frequency while fare and bus capacity increase, and (iii) the optimal running speed grows with the logarithm of <b>demand.</b> <b>Bus</b> Fare payment method Running speed Congestion Operator cost Travel time...|$|E
30|$|If {{this new}} measure is {{combined}} {{with the introduction of}} time windows, special attention should be paid to the level of service as shorter time windows may lead to increasing the number of last-mile operating vehicles and bus utilization. High upfront investment costs are needed in order to build or adjust transshipment spaces, hire personnel for goods handling both at bus terminals and at bus stops, etc. Social uptake should also be under investigation because the image of buses (and their level of service) is expected to change. Finally, there is an issue concerning the type of goods that should be transported (fragile, sensitive, etc.) and their size. Bus capacity is limited and its availability depends on several factors such as passenger <b>demand,</b> <b>bus</b> route and so on, and, thus, conflicts could be created between the retailer’s demand and existing supply. Public transport is mainly a transport service for passengers and it should operate mostly with respect to passengers’ needs.|$|E

As {{a result of this}} year's project, we proposed "Tsuneishi Smart Community" system. This systemutilized strong and active local community, which is valuable social capital in Tsuneishi area. Through our project, we clarified five core issues in Tsuneishi area. Communication, traffic, shopping, education and land are their core issues. We interviewed residents in Tsuneishi for 5 times. At first, we defined four problems from the VOC by using KJ diagram. i. Traffic problem caused by lack of public transport system and narrow road. ii. People can't drive a car have difficulty to go shopping iii. Children must go other area for higher education. iv. Narrow land restrict to build new buildings and houses In this project, we defined "revitalization" as improving these problems. We selected traffic problem as most important. The land problem is given environment, and has huge challenge to improve it. Causal loop diagram shows that the shopping and education problem will be solved by traffic system. While the interview, people mentioned about the traffic problem most frequently. According to the questionnaire responded by Tsuneishi residents, 60 % people think that the traffic problem is the most important. Additional interview and observation conducted after we defined four problems showed us the other problem: communication gap in Tsuneishi area. There are 3 major gaps between sub-communities, such as different generation, different town association, or Tsuneishi Employee and other residents. On the other hand, we found out that there are active local community. They have many event and communication in the community center. It is the wonderful resource in Tsuneishi. CVCA included interview results shows us that these sub-communities have no relations each other. WCA result is similar. As a result of concept generation, we reached "On Demand Bus" system as initial idea. On <b>Demand</b> <b>Bus</b> System is the public transportation system with flexible bus operation is regarding user demand. QFD result shows time to destination and distance to bus stop are key quality metric in transportation system design. In this phase this system seems suitable solution.. In the next phase, we used Pugh selection to compare traffic systems. Both of On <b>Demand</b> <b>Bus</b> System and Car Sharing System show similar advantage, so we combined each advantage and propose new system. On <b>Demand</b> <b>Bus</b> System has challenge on sustainable profit. The system is introduced in the many community, butalmost all of these cases require the subsidy from local govenment Usually 70 % of incomes are subsidies. The system is very useful for substitute of the local fixed route bus, {{but it is difficult to}} operate for private enterprises. From the study result we made, we recommend Hitch Life Community System. The system has a concept "we are all friends in Tsuneishi". The system is the membership carpool system in Tsuneishi utilize strong human network. A fundamental use-case is described below. Drivers and users made member registration first. A driver responds to a user's hitchhike usually. User interface is local SNS and Kairanban: a notice around from house to house in the neighborhood. A user can check operation status of a car and make reservation. A driver pick up users could earn local currency as incentive. Moreover, the system uses the bus already operated inside the Tsuneishi HD factory as a On <b>Demand</b> <b>Bus</b> in the high demands time as morning. Income source of the system is user's registration fee, advertise revenue on the car and sales of cooperation stores. We carried out field survey of the French Covoiturage system as the system's benchmark. Covoiturage is the carpool system using SNS started by a venture enterprise. The system is intended to transport from a local city to other local city in French. At first, users and drivers write their schedule and search for travel partner. Users have to negotiate with a driver from several days before. A user pays a part of highway cost and gasoline cost for a driver. Now, Covoiturage is a governmental promotion enterprise and has 1, 000, 000 users. In the early phase of this system, Tsuneishi HD will recommend their employee, which occupies the half of the daytime population in Tsuneishi area becoming a driver to provide drivers need in early phase. We assume that student who attends school not located in Tsuneishi area will be major user in early phase. Biggest risk of thinking has uneasiness to the responsibility and safety in case of a traffic accident. It seems that both user and driver feel anxious from result of questionnaire. As a countermeasure, evaluation system of the driver similar to covoirturage could be introduced...|$|E

40|$|Developing public {{transportation}} and giving priority to buses is a feasible solution {{for improving the}} level of {{public transportation}} service, which facilitates congestion alleviation and prevention, and contributes to urban development and city sustainability. This paper presents a novel bus operation control strategy including both holding control and speed control to improve the level of service of transit systems within a connected vehicle environment. Most previous work focuses on optimization of signal timing to decrease the bus signal delay by assuming that holding control is not applied; the speed of buses is given as a constant input and the acceleration and deceleration processes of buses can be neglected. This paper explores {{the benefits of a}} bus operation control strategy to minimize the total cost, which includes bus signal delay, bus holding delay, bus travel delay, acceleration cost due to frequent stops and intense driving. A set of formulations are developed to explicitly capture the interaction between bus holding control and speed control. Experimental analysisand simulation tests have shown that the proposed integrated operational model outperforms the traditional control, speed control only, or holding control only strategies in terms of reducing the total cost of buses. The sensitivity analysis has further demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the proposed approach to be applied in a real-time bus operation control system under different levels of traffic <b>demand,</b> <b>bus</b> stop locations, and speed limits...|$|E
40|$|Power grids {{have long}} {{been a source of}} {{interesting}} optimization problems. Perhaps best known among the optimization community are the unit commitment problems and related generator dispatching tasks. However, recent blackout events have renewed interest on problems related to grid vulnerabilities. A difficult problem that has been widely studied, the N-K problem, concerns the detection of small cardinality sets of lines or buses whose simultaneous outage could develop into a significant failure event. This is a hard combinatorial problem which, unlike the typical formulations for the unit commitment problem, includes a detailed model of flows in the grid. A different set of algorithmic questions concern how to react to protect a grid when a significant event has taken place. This is the outlook that we take in this paper. In this context, the central modeling ingredient is that power grids display cascading behavior. In this paper, building on prior models for cascades, we consider an affine, adaptive, distributive control algorithm that is computed {{at the start of the}} cascade and deployed during the cascade. The control sheds demand as a function of observations of the state of the grid, with the objective of terminating the cascade with a minimum amount of demand lost. The optimization problem handled at the start of the cascade computes the coefficients in the affine control (one set of coefficients per <b>demand</b> <b>bus).</b> We present numerical experiments with parallel implementations of our algorithms, using as data a snapshot of the U. S. Eastern Interconnect, with approximately 15000 buses and 23000 lines...|$|E
40|$|The Thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Civil Engineering for the MSc in TransportationIn Sri Lanka the public transport bus services arc provided jointly by the state sector and the private sector. The state sector has schedules for buses. and crews, but private sector buses are operated by individual operators and the permits are issued to only one selected route. As a result. the passenger transport services are difficult to manage due to the existing ownership structure. As a solution. the National Transport Commission recently introduced the formation or passenger bus companies. In this study, {{it is assumed that}} the buses are operated by well organized passenger transport companies. In order to provide reliable and comfortable service to the passengers, the passenger transport companies should consider two important factors buses and crews. These two factors should be scientifically designed in order to provide the best possible service to the passengers at the lowest possible cost. Time tabling is the process of determining how frequently buses must operate on routes based on passenger <b>demand.</b> <b>Bus</b> schedules are process of assigning buses to trips to ensure that the total cost is minimized. Scheduling is carried out by assuming that the start and end time as well as the start and end locations of all trips arc fixed.

It finds that the bus and the MAX have significantly different fare elasticities. We observe that riders have fare inelastic ridership <b>demand</b> for <b>bus</b> transit and fare elastic ridership demand for MAX transit. Based on the estimated effect of income on ridership demand, we find that bus service is an inferior good and MAX ridership is a normal good. These results are consistent with the fare and income elasticity findings of other studies and make intuitive sense. This suggests that although both modes of public transit in the Portland area operate at the same price level without competition from other public transit agencies, demand behavior for each service is not the same...|$|R
40|$|Theme 4 The {{local public}} {{transport}} system in the Lombardy Region is to be restructured {{in order to improve}} the effectiveness and efficiency of public transportation. In line with EU and national legislation, public authorities are to be directly responsible for the planning and financial support of public transport, stipulating contracts with train and bus companies setting out specific requirements on both sides for the supply of transportation services (regional authorities for rail transport and local authorities for bus transport). Monitoring of the transport system is therefore a key activity for the Region in planning local railway services and promoting – in agreement with Provinces – a regional, trans-modal transport network which makes better use of transport facilities. MISTRAL is a project which aims to define an information system to support regional and local authority planning of transport activities by: · monitoring the contracts for transportation services that public authorities are to stipulate with train and bus companies; · evaluating the transport system through indicators related to mobility and transport <b>demand,</b> <b>bus</b> and train supply (involving both transportation and economic aspects) and all issues affecting public transport (e. g. : distribution of public facilities such as schools, possibility of park-and-ride etc.); · providing support to decision and negotiation processes with methodologies based on multicriteria analysis, sensitivity analysis and analytical techniques for solving conflict; · providing standard information and procedures regarding the regional transport system to public authorities, transport companies and users.
