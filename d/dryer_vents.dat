40|$|It’s easy to {{tell when}} your neighbors are doing the wash: just sniff the outdoor air for the scent of laundry products. In a new study, {{researchers}} have identified components of those scented emissions that are classified as hazardous air pollutants and known or probable carcinogens. 1 The bottom line, says first author Anne Steinemann, is that “there are hazardous chemicals coming out of <b>dryer</b> <b>vents.</b> ” However, very little research has examined whether exposure to these chemicals {{in the context of}} dryer-vent emissions has adverse health effects. Toxicological studies have shown that many individual fragrance ingredients are safe at the concentrations used in consumer products. 2 However, exposure to scented products has been documented to cause irritation of the eyes and airways, contact dermatitis, migraines, and asthmatic reactions, particularly in sensitive individuals. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 According to one 2000 article, mice exposed to emissions from five fabric-softener products experienced sensory and pulmonary irritatio...|$|E

50|$|A clean, {{unobstructed}} <b>dryer</b> <b>vent</b> {{improves the}} safety and efficiency of the dryer. As the dryer duct pipe becomes partially obstructed and filled with lint, drying time increases and causes the dryer to overheat and waste energy. In extreme cases, a blocked vent {{may result in a}} fire. Clothes dryers are one of the more costly home appliances to operate.|$|R
50|$|When {{not working}} on solar panels, OCS {{employees}} {{work in the}} year-round weatherization program focused on households throughout Cleveland. According to Casey Gillfeather, OCS director of operations, the weatherization process includes insulating exterior walls, wrapping the hot water tank, installing an energy-efficient <b>dryer</b> <b>vent,</b> weatherize the basement, and insulating the attic {{in order to reduce}} energy consumption of the house by one-third.|$|R
50|$|Improvised {{methods of}} {{salvaging}} this heat for in-home heating, {{by use of}} inline vent boxes equipped with a flapper valve to redirect moist heated air to indoor areas, will also increase humidity within a dwelling. Although this may be beneficial in dry winter conditions, excess humidity from these devices increases likelihood of mold, mildew, and bacterial growth inside a home. Indoor venting may also be against local regulations. Gas dryers must always be vented outdoors, as the products of combustion are mixed with the moist air. Building codes and manufacturers' instructions usually recommended that <b>dryers</b> <b>vent</b> outdoors. An indoor lint trap kit poses a similar concern of increased humidity within the dwelling.|$|R

The Atkinson police discovered his body on the floor of his master bathroom after Pamela Sullivan saw a <b>dryer</b> <b>vent</b> tube connected to the exhaust pipe of Delp's yellow car. Two charcoal grills were found to have been lit inside the bathtub causing the room to fill with smoke. A suicide note was paper-clipped to the neck of his T-shirt, which read: [...] "Mr. Brad Delp. 'J'ai une âme solitaire'. I am a lonely soul." [...] Delp left four sealed envelopes in his office addressed to his children, his former wife Micki, his fiancée, and another unnamed couple. He was 55 years old.

50|$|For tumble dryers {{the energy}} {{efficiency}} scale is calculated using the cotton drying cycle {{with a maximum}} declared load. The energy efficiency index is in kW·h per kilogramme of load. Different scales apply for condenser and <b>vented</b> <b>dryers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most washer dryer combos are ventless and are {{designed}} with drying systems that work differently from the ordinary stand-alone (<b>vented)</b> <b>dryer.</b> Instead of <b>venting</b> moist hot air to the outside, like a conventional dryer would, the combo unit makes use of condensation similarly to condenser dryers. Hot dry(er) air enters the drum from either the front or the rear, and evaporates some of the moisture from the tumbling clothing. This warm, damp air is then drawn through a condensing chamber, and the extracted water is flushed out the drain hose to the sink or through the plumbing lines. These units are easy to install under cabinets, in closets or anywhere with electricity.|$|R

50|$|In the European Union, the EU energy {{labeling}} {{system is}} applied to dryers; dryers are classified with a label from A+++ (best) to G (worst) according {{to the amount of}} energy used per kilogram of clothes (kWh/kg). Sensor dryers can automatically sense that clothes are dry and switch off. This means over-drying is not as frequent. Most of the European market sells sensor dryers now, and they are normally available in condenser and <b>vented</b> <b>dryers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Ultrafine {{particles}} (∼ 10 - 100 nm) {{were measured}} continuously for 18 months in an occupied townhouse. A major source {{was determined to}} be the gas clothes dryer. Although the <b>dryer</b> was <b>vented</b> to the outdoors it consistently produced an order of magnitude increase in the ultrafine concentrations compared to times with no indoor sources. Short-term peak number concentrations exceeded 100, 000 cm- 3 on a number of occasions. The source strength was conservatively estimated at about 6 X 1012 ultrafine particles produced per drying episode. These values are underestimates, since the part of the peak below 9. 8 nm was not measured. Averaged over 150 hours of operation, the number concentration showed a major peak at the smallest size measured (9. 8 nm) and a secondary peak at 30 nm. Loss rates of the ultrafines due to diffusion, deposition, and particle growth (1 - 2 h- 1) were high compared to losses due to air exchange (0. 1 - 0. 6 h- 1). Considering the reported health effects of ultrafines, the widespread use of gas dryers, and the substantial amount of time that gas dryers are operated in many homes, it may be desirable to carry out further research to determine if the results reported here for a single dryer in one home are reproducible under different conditions...|$|R
40|$|Since {{early the}} early 20 th century the {{electrical}} tumble dryer became an appliance to dry clothes. During {{many years of}} improvements different configurations to solve issues on decreased drying time and more energy efficient solutions has been performed. Several different configurations have been developed; air <b>vented</b> <b>dryers,</b> condensing dryers {{and the most recent}} heat pump dryers. The heat pumps in drying technology became the next solution based on improved drying time and decreased energy consumption. With today’s focus on energy consumption, with energy demanding appliance such as the clothes dryer; new technology that satisfy the customers need must be available. By introducing the heat pump to the drying technology, a suitable refrigerant must be chosen. The choice should be based on several factors; the performance of the heat pump and the refrigerants GWP and ODP values, its toxicity and safety for the consumer. This report is based on a heat pump dryer made for an R 134 a system. R 134 a has a global warming potential (GWP) 1300 times the value of R 744 (carbon dioxide). This report will present the feasibility of replacing the R 134 a system with a system designed for carbon dioxide as refrigerant. Carbon dioxide or R 744 is a natural refrigerant, and it is in contrast to other commonly used refrigerants operating in the transcritical region. This implies that the heat rejection is performed with gliding temperature exchange, not by condensation as for the R 134 a. This is due to the low critical temperature of carbon dioxide; a critical pressure of 73. 8 Bara and a critical temperature of 31. 1 &# 730;C. Despite the required high pressures, the heat exchange properties of carbon dioxide in the critical region are very good, and new technology can take advantage of this. By SINTEF developed simulation tool HX SIM Basic 2007, based on results from the R 134 a cycle, heat exchangers have been designed to reach the optimal solution. The capacity of the heat changers and the compressor will be the same as the R 134 a system. The system is built with a manual throttling valve in parallel to a capillary tube, during the experiments the system will be tested to find the most optimal set point. Evaporating pressures from 40 to 50 Bara and gas cooler pressures from critical pressures to 120 Bara have been applied in the experiments. The main purpose of the experiments is to find a system design that will fulfil both energy saving requirements and have a simple enough construction for it to be a market product. Based on the experiments on this first prototype and the results obtained; a conclusion is that the dryer with CO 2 as refrigerant is using marginally more energy than the R 134 a system. However this is a first prototype and its potential should be investigated further. </p...|$|R
