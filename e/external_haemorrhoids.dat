40|$|BACKGROUND: Thrombosed <b>external</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} anorectal emergencies. They are associated with swelling and intense pain. Internal sphincter hypertonicity plays a role in the aetiology of the pain. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of an intrasphincteric injection of botulinum toxin for pain relief in patients with thrombosed <b>external</b> <b>haemorrhoids.</b> METHODS: Thirty patients with thrombosed <b>external</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> who refused surgical operation were randomized into two groups. Patients received an intrasphincteric injection of either 0. 6 ml saline or 0. 6 ml of a solution containing 30 units botulinum toxin. Anorectal manometry was performed before treatment and 5 days afterwards. RESULTS: After 5 days of treatment, the maximum resting pressure fell in both groups, but was significantly lower in the botulinum toxin group (P = 0. 004). Pain intensity was significantly reduced within 24 h of botulinum toxin treatment (P < 0. 001), but only after 1 week in the placebo group (P = 0. 019). CONCLUSION: A single injection of botulinum toxin into the anal sphincter seems to be effective in rapidly controlling the pain associated with thrombosed <b>external</b> <b>haemorrhoids,</b> and could represent an effective conservative treatment for this condition.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of anal protrusions in {{children may be}} difficult, because the protrusion often occurs only after defaecation, and is usually invisible during the consultation. We present three cases of children with rectal prolapse (4 -year-old boy), polyp (4 -year-old boy), and <b>external</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> (3 -year-old boy), respectively. In each case, the diagnosis could be made after parents had sent {{a picture of the}} phenomenon. The first patient recovered after laxative therapy, the second after polypectomy, and in the third patient, the haemorrhoid persisted, despite laxative therapy and physiotherap...|$|E
40|$|Haemorrhoids {{are one of}} {{the most}} common anal {{disorders}} encountered in primary care. Haemorrhoids are defined as the symptomatic enlargement and distal displacement of the normal anal cushions. 1 These cushions are usually found in three main locations: left lateral, right anterior, and right posterior (3, 7 and 11 o'clock positions). 2 These vascular cushions participate in the drainage of the anal canal. It has also been suggested that these cushions intensify the action of the anal sphincter mechanism, thereby contributing to continence. There are two types of haemorrhoids: internal and external. Internal haemorrhoids arise above the dentate line, are viscerally innervated and therefore painless. <b>External</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> can be painful because they originate below the dentate line and have a somatic innervation. 3 Internal haemorrhoids are further subdivided according to the degree of prolapsed. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background It is {{important}} {{to better understand the}} aetiology of thrombosed <b>external</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> (TEH) because recurrence rates are high, prophylaxis is unknown, and optimal therapy is highly debated. Findings We conducted a questionnaire study of individuals with and without TEH. Aetiology was studied by comparison of answers to a questionnaire given to individuals with and without TEH concerning demography, history, and published aetiologic hypotheses. Participants were evaluated consecutively at our institution from March 2004 through August 2005. One hundred forty-eight individuals were enrolled, including 72 patients with TEH and 76 individuals without TEH but with alternative diagnoses, such as a screening colonoscopy or colonic polyps. Out of 38 possible aetiologic factors evaluated, 20 showed no significant bivariate correlation to TEH and were no longer traced, and 16 factors showed a significant bivariate relationship to TEH. By multivariate analysis, six independent variables were found to predict TEH correctly in 79. 1 % of cases: age of 46 years or younger, use of excessive physical effort, and use of dry toilet paper combined with wet cleaning methods after defaecation were associated with a significantly higher risk of developing TEH; use of bathtub, use of the shower, and genital cleaning before sleep {{at least once a week}} were associated with a significantly lower risk of developing TEH. Conclusion Six hypotheses on the causes of TEH have a high probability of being correct and should be considered in future studies on aetiology, prophylaxis, and therapy of TEH. </p...|$|E
