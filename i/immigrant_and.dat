40|$|We study {{differences}} in contributory and non-contributory welfare benefit receipt between <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> natives for 16 EU countries. In contrast to previous studies we analyse {{differences in}} benefit levels allowing for potentially different takeup rates between <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> natives and use Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions to discuss residual welfare dependence. Results point to substantial heterogeneity in welfare dependence between countries when not controlling for observed characteristics of <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> natives. This is {{primarily due to}} different selection into benefits between <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> natives and differences in their characteristics (mainly income, personal, and household characteristics). Once this is controlled for, immigrants participate at most equally often in both types of benefits as natives and usually also receive lower or comparable benefit levels...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a broad {{approach to the}} analysis of immigration by combining aspects of both supply of <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> demand for <b>immigrants.</b> Immigration is assumed to be motivated by lack of economic and noneconomic opportunities; <b>and,</b> correspondingly, <b>immigrants</b> are classified as early <b>immigrants,</b> late <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> refugees. An optimal immigration quota 2 ̆ 7 s policy, which is based on a linear feedback rule and aimed at stabilizing the host-country’s unemployment level, is developed. The optimal feedback coefficient is found to be dependent upon the correlations of the number of legal immigrants in the previous period with the current numbers of illegal <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> vacant jobs, and upon the variances of these variables. The consequences of the feedback policy on the numbers of early <b>immigrants,</b> late <b>immigrants,</b> <b>and</b> illegal <b>immigrants</b> are discussed under the assumption that early <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> late <b>immigrants</b> generate rational expectations about incomes in the host country. This conceptual framework is applied to the United States in order to assess its immigration policy...|$|R

Ruth's parents, George Herman Ruth Sr. (1871–1918) and Katherine Schamberger, were both of German American ancestry. According to the 1880 census, his parents were born in Maryland. His {{paternal}} grandparents were from Prussia and Hanover. Ruth Sr. worked a series of jobs that included lightning rod salesman and streetcar operator. The elder Ruth then became a counterman in a family-owned combination grocery and saloon business on Frederick Street.

Only one of young George's seven siblings, his younger sister Mamie, survived infancy.|$|E
5|$|Shemanski Fountain, {{also known}} as Rebecca at the Well, is an outdoor {{fountain}} with a bronze sculpture, located in the South Park Blocks of downtown Portland, Oregon, in the United States.

Linde designed the trefoil, which features a statue designed by Oliver Laurence Barrett. The sculpture, which was added to the fountain in 1928, depicts the biblical personage Rebecca.

5|$|Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Miami is a {{separate}} non-profit organization operated by the Archdiocese of Miami. It {{is part of a}} national network of organizations that are operated in each U.S. diocese. This organization claims to be the largest nongovernmental provider of services to the needy in South Florida. It began in 1931 during the Great Depression with four Miami-area pastors and lay members of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. It employs over 600 staff and operates on an annual budget of over $38 million. In 2006, it served over 17,000 families in the tri-county area of Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties. Some of these services include transitional housing, homeless shelters, elderly day care, child day care, addiction recovery, HIV/AIDS programs, family and school counseling, meals for the elderly and various <b>immigrant</b> <b>and</b> refugee help programs among others.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with an essay by Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine <b>immigrant</b> <b>and</b> labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} factors {{underlying}} {{the differences that}} exist between <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> natives in the selective process {{at work in the}} transition from lower to upper secondary school in France. The analysis shows that the academic performance of <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> natives is unequal. This imbalance, in addition to the inadequate understanding of how the school system functions and the time passed since arriving in the host country, sufficiently accounts for the initial inter-group variation in grades. After controlling for class and immigration related variables, ethnicity was found to have a minor role in the explanation of educational differentials between <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> natives.

40|$|Abstract: Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} continuity of care in the psychiatric healthcare system from the perspective of patients, including vulnerable groups such as <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> refugees. Method: The study is based on 19 narrative interviews conducted with 15 patients with diverse migration backgrounds (<b>immigrants,</b> descendents, refugees, <b>and</b> ethnic Danes). Patients were recruited from a community psychiatric centre situated in an area with a high proportion of <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> refugees. Data were analysed through the lens of a theoretical framework of continuity of care in psychiatry, developed in 2004 by Joyce et al., which encompasses four domains: accessibility, individualised care, relationship base and service delivery. Results: Investigating continuity of care, we found issues of specific concern to <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> refugees, but also commonalities across the groups. For accessibility, areas pertinent to <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> refugees include lack o...|$|R

40|$|This study uses six Canadian censuses {{spanning}} from 1981 to 2006 and the 2011 National Household Survey {{to examine}} employment rate gaps between <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> non-immigrants during thirty years. Recent immigrants {{are found to}} have lower probabilities of being employed than Canadian-born people. The employment rate gaps of immigrants are analyzed through the estimations of entry, assimilation and cohort effects. The entry effect is the estimated immigrants’ employment penalty at the year of arrival; the assimilation effect refers to {{the difference in the}} returns to experience between <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> natives; and the cohort effect represents immigrants’ “quality” change through different arriving cohorts. The paper identifies some of the reasons leading to a worsened labour market performance of recent <b>immigrants.</b> Entry effects <b>and</b> cohort effects {{can be explained by the}} shift in the composition of new <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> by the macroeconomic conditions. The speed of assimilation effect can be related to the distribution of educational achievements of recent <b>immigrants</b> <b>and</b> to the concentration of places of residence...|$|R
