5|$|In P. fimbriata from Queensland and in {{some other}} species, {{contests}} between males usually last only 5 to 10seconds, and only their legs make contact. Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and in P. fimbriata from Queensland these often including grappling that sometimes breaks a leg. A victor may evict a loser, and then <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> loser's eggs and take over the loser's web. Unlike in some other Portia species, victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill and <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> losers.|$|E

When queens were removed, up to 40% of the workers activated their ovaries in subsequent days. However, policing workers continued to <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> worker-laid eggs, suggesting that the mechanism of policing in this species does not involve direct intervention from the queen.|$|E

5|$|Agar.io is a massively {{multiplayer}} online action game {{created by}} Matheus Valadares. Players control a cell in a map representing a petri dish.

The name comes from the substance agar, used to culture bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Cortinarius violaceus {{mushrooms}} are considered edible, {{but they are}} not choice; instead, the primary appeal of the species to mushroom hunters, according to Arora, is its beauty.

50|$|Many rivers {{fed into}} the sea {{bringing}} leaves and driftwood from the land. These served as {{the base of the}} food chain. Bacteria and other microscopic scavengers <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> decaying wood. Plankton <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> bacteria. Clams filtered the small plankton. Snails <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> clams and were eaten in turn by crabs and fish. Mosasaurs and cephalopods <b>ate</b> <b>the</b> fish and crabs. Some organisms were swimmers or floaters, but most lived on or in the sandy mud of the sea bottom. This layer of sandy clay, bones, and shells became the Coon Creek Formation.|$|R

5|$|Killer {{whales in}} many areas may prey on {{cormorants}} and gulls. A captive killer whale at MarineLand discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> birds. Four others then learned to copy the behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{visits the}} office and announces {{that he wants to}} make amends for his past behavior.

She remains adamant on this point even after Packer leaves, but once Pam goes home the {{remaining}} employees <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> cupcakes. Packer reveals to the documentary crew that he spiked the cupcakes with drugs, supposedly as revenge for getting him fired (though none of the employees present save Nellie {{had anything to do with}} his being fired). He then visits Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) at Athlead in Philadelphia, pulling the same trick on them. In the morning, Pam returns to {{the office and}} announces she is going to eat her cupcake, only to find everyone else reeling from the aftereffects of Packer's deed.|$|E

5|$|Monica (Courteney Cox) {{tells her}} friends {{that she will}} not be cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving because of the large amount of {{leftovers}} it will create. Chandler does not eat turkey {{as a result of his}} dislike of all Thanksgiving foods (a result of childhood trauma), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow's character) is a vegetarian and Rachel was having an aversion to poultry from her pregnancy. This left only Monica, Ross and Joey to <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> enormous turkey. Joey (Matt LeBlanc) protests, and announces that he will <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> entire turkey himself if necessary. Monica agrees, and Joey finishes the nineteen-pound turkey by the end of the episode. Monica tells Rachel that she has invited over an old high-school friend of hers and Ross's called Will Colbert (Brad Pitt). Rachel does not remember him, and he reacts with total disgust when he finds out Rachel will be joining them for dinner.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves show a {{preference}} for the seeds of certain species of plant over others. Foods taken in preference to others include pine nuts, sweetgum seeds, and the seeds of pokeberry, amaranth, canary grass, corn, sesame, and wheat. When their favorite foods are absent, mourning doves will <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> seeds of other plants, including buckwheat, rye, goosegrass and smartweed.|$|E
5|$|Often farmers {{would leave}} a solitary cabbage tree—or even groves of trees—standing after the swamps were drained. Most of these trees will slowly die out because {{livestock}} <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> seedlings and damage the trunks and roots of adult trees. When a cabbage tree {{is the only}} shade in a field, stock will shelter underneath it, damaging the bark by rubbing against it, and compacting the soil around the tree. Cows, sheep, goats, and deer <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> nutritious tissue under the bark of cabbage trees. Once the trunk has been damaged by animals, it seldom heals and the wounds get bigger over time. Eventually the tissue in {{the centre of the}} stem rots away and a cavity forms along its entire length. The trunk becomes misshapen or completely ring-barked for a metre above the ground. Often the growth layer dies and the injuries may lead to bacterial or fungal infections that spread into the branches until the canopy too begins to die. Other factors thought to contribute to Rural Decline include wood-rotting fungi like Phanerochaete cordylines, micro-organisms which cause saprobic decay and leaf-feeding caterpillars.|$|E

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the War of the First Coalition, Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. Unfortunately for him, military rations were insufficient to satisfy his appetite. He would carry out tasks for other soldiers in return for a share of their rations and scavenge on the dungheap for scraps, but this was not enough to satisfy him. Suffering from extreme exhaustion, he was admitted to the military hospital at Soultz-Haut-Rhin. He was granted quadruple rations but remained hungry; he would scavenge for garbage in gutters and refuse containers, <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> scraps of food left by other patients, and creep into the apothecary's room to <b>eat</b> <b>the</b> poultices. Military surgeons could not understand his appetite; Tarrare was ordered to remain in the military hospital to take part in physiological experiments designed by Dr.Courville (surgeon to the 9th Hussar Regiment) and George Didier, Baron Percy, surgeon-in-chief of the hospital.|$|E
