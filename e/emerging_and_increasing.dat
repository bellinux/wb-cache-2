The experimental design was split plot based on randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The emergence time was considered in three levels: emergence of the weed 14 days earlier, 7 days earlier and concurrent with corn, respectively, as main plots and density of weed at six levels: 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 plants per m 2, respectively, as subplots.

40|$|Congenital hearing {{impairment}} affects nearly 1 in every 1000 live births {{and is the}} most frequent birth defect in developed societies. Hereditary types of hearing loss {{account for more than}} 50 % of all congenital sensorineural hearing loss cases and are caused by genetic mutations. HL can be either nonsyndromic, which is restricted to the inner ear, or syndromic, a part of multiple anomalies affecting the body. Nonsyndromic HL can be categorised by mode of inheritance, such as autosomal dominant (called DFNA), autosomal recessive (DFNB), mitochondrial, and X-linked (DFN). To date, 125 deafness loci {{have been reported in the}} literature: 58 DFNA loci, 63 DFNB loci, and 4 X-linked loci. Mutations in genes that control the adhesion of hair cells, intracellular transport, neurotransmitter release, ionic hemeostasis, and cytoskeleton of hair cells can lead to malfunctions of the cochlea and inner ear.

40|$|Energy systems {{across the}} globe are going through a radical {{transformation}} {{as a result of}} technological and institutional changes, depletion of fossil fuel resources, and climate change issues. Accordingly, local energy initiatives are <b>emerging</b> <b>and</b> <b>increasing</b> number of the business models are focusing on the end-users. In this context, Integrated community energy systems (ICESs) are emerging as a modern development to reorganize local energy systems allowing simultaneous integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and engagement of local communities. With the emergence of ICESs new roles and responsibilities as well as interactions and dynamics are expected in the energy system. With this background, this thesis aims to understand the ways in which ICESs can contribute to enhancing the energy transition. This thesis utilizes a conceptual framework consisting of four institutional and three societal levels {{in order to understand the}} interaction and dynamics of ICESs implementation. Current energy trends and the associated technological, socio-economic, environmental and institutional issues are reviewed. The developed ICES model performs optimal planning and operation of ICESs and assesses their performance based on economic and environmental metrics. This thesis demonstrates the added value of ICESs to the individual households, local communities, and the society. As the added value of ICESs is impacted by the institutional settings internal and external to the system, a comprehensive institutional design considering techno-economic and institutional perspectives is necessary to ensure effective contribution of ICESs in the energy transition. <br/...|$|E

This {{study was to}} investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of IBD in Northern China. METHODS: This is a prospective, population-based study of incidence of IBD in Daqing, Heilongjiang province of Northern China from March 1, 2012 to February 28, 2013. All incident patients with IBD were clinically identified by IBD specialist group from five main General Hospitals covering the healthcare service for 1, 343, 364 residents in the urban areas of Daqing. IBD cases included in this study were followed-up for three months for diagnosis confirmation. RESULTS: A total of 27 new IBD cases including 25 cases of ulcerative colitis (UC) and 2 cases of Crohn's disease (CD) were identified. The population at risk was 1, 343, 364 person years. Age-adjusted incidence for total IBD, CD and UC were 1. 77, 0. 13, and 1. 64 per 100, 000 population, respectively. A male predominance was found in CD patients (male to female ratio was 2 ∶ 0). In contrast, no obvious gender predominance was found in UC patients (male to female ratio was 1 ∶ 1. 1). CD patients were diagnosed at an average age of 39. 5 years. The main disease phenotypes of UC were distal colitis with a 24 % of proctitis and 56 % of left-sided colitis. The mean diagnostic age of UC patients was 48. 9 years. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the incidence of IBD in the Northern Chinese population. A lower incidence of IBD, similar male predominance for CD, similar disease phenotype of UC, and lower disease activity was observed in Daqing compared to that in Southern China...|$|E

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{of human}} embryonic stem (ES) cells changes with their colonial growth. For {{a better understanding of}} the growth of ES cell colonies in culture, we determined their cytochemical and ultrastructural characteristics focusing on images of living cells under a phase contrast microscope. During the initial growth stages, the colonies exhibited a mosaic appearance with discernible cell–cell borders. PAS staining coupled with amylase digestion demonstrated that the bright granules and dark deposits in the cytoplasm contained glycogen. Ultrastructurally they were glycogen accumulations, and clustered open spaces associated with various amounts of glycogen. Although intercellularly heterogeneous, these structures were detectable throughout colony growth. As the colonies grew, compaction towards the centre <b>emerged</b> <b>and</b> <b>increased,</b> accompanied by heterogeneous increases in coarse particles with or without a halo. TUNEL showed these particles to consist at least in part of apoptotic cells/bodies. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that most apoptotic cells had been phagocytosed by intact ES cells. Spontaneous differentiation was detected occasionally in the periphery of the colonies. The presence of PAS-positive fibrous structures not susceptible to amylase digestion and laminin-immunoreactivity indicated the accumulation of extracellular matrix in the peripheral differentiated areas. These findings made it possible to determine the growth stage of human ES cell colonies...|$|R

To be clear, Force as Mover is not a ‘wrong’ resource that students should never use. On the contrary, it can correctly explain commonplace situations in everyday life, as pointed out earlier. But it does not always work well as an explanatory resource in more complex situations that involve the combinations of forces along different directions. Levels in SURGE Next deliberately expose students to situations where Force as Mover is not productive, enabling students to iteratively revise and refine their reasoning through re-designing, re-deploying, and re-assessing their solutions. The nature of the solution process itself - i.e., the placement of impulses along the predicted path of Surge - made explicit students' underlying assumptions, {{and the ability to}} verify, revise, and refine their solutions offered them opportunities to reflect and consider other conceptual resources. Gradually, new resources such as Force as Deflector <b>emerged</b> <b>and</b> <b>increased</b> in cueing priority, but only after repeated attempts and failures to make the primary resource of Force as Mover work.

Origin-state institutions dedicated to emigrants {{and their descendants}} have been largely overlooked in mainstream political studies, perhaps because they fall in the grey area between domestic politics and international relations.

In response, we identify and then investigate empirical support for three theoretically-grounded perspectives on diaspora institution emergence and importance: instrumentally rational states tapping resources of emigrants and their descendants; value-rational states embracing lost members of the nation-state; institutionally-converging states governing diasporas consistent with global norms. We document support for these alternative perspectives in regression and related analyses modelling diaspora institution emergence and importance in 144 states observed from 1990 - 2010. Tapping perspective estimations exhibit better overall model fit compared to estimations based on other perspectives. Estimations combining perspectives exhibit the best model fit.
