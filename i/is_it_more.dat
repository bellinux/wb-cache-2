25|$|The {{pervaporation}} method uses a membrane {{that is more}} permeable to the one constituent than {{to another}} to separate the constituents of an azeotrope as it passes from liquid to vapor phase. The membrane is rigged to lie between the liquid and vapor phases. Another membrane method is vapor permeation, where the constituents pass through the membrane entirely in the vapor phase. In all membrane methods, the membrane separates the fluid passing through it into a permeate (that which passes through) and a retentate (that which is left behind). When the membrane is chosen so that <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> permeable to one constituent than another, then the permeate will be richer in that first constituent than the retentate.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{praised the}} game's combat and pacing. G4 called the game's combat [...] "sublime," [...] {{and said that}} [...] "no Infinity Engine game thus far has had such {{interesting}} and intricate tactical combat." [...] GameSpot called it [...] "expertly paced." [...] PC Zone complained that certain gameplay mechanics had become outdated, but that [...] "the only real downer is the antiquated spell system and the inexplicable necessity to rest after every fight." [...] The game was also praised for its implementation of the Third Edition rules and interface. Computer Gaming World said that [...] "IWD II has the Third Edition rules down, and in no other place in the game <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> apparent than with character development," [...] and PC Gamer said it had [...] "a dazzling implementation of the D 3rd Edition rules." [...] GameSpot called the interface [...] "a big improvement on the spread-out interface of all previous Infinity Engine games," [...] and IGN said that [...] "the customization improvements to the interface that seem so natural, they make you wonder why they weren't thought of before." [...] Game Informer called the interface [...] "absolutely inspired" [...] and its inventory system [...] "second to none." ...|$|E
