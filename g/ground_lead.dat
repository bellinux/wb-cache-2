60|$|At 7.15 a.m. we {{struck the}} camp at Jebel Kibár, and moved due eastward towards the Pass. This {{north-eastern}} Khuraytah (Col) is termed the Khuraytat el-Hismá or el-Jils, after a hillock on the plateau-summit, to {{distinguish it from}} the similar feature to the south-west: the latter {{is known as the}} Khuraytat el-Zibá; or el-T h m , the local pronunciation of Tihámah. About two miles of rough and broken <b>ground</b> <b>lead</b> {{to the foot of the}} ladder. The zigzags then follow the line of a mountain torrent, the natural Pass, crossing its bed from left to right and from right again to left: the path is the rudest of corniches, worn by the feet of man and beast; and showing some ugly abrupt turns. The absolute height of the ascent is about 450 feet (aner. 26.70--26.25) and the length half a mile. The ground, composed mostly of irregular rock-steps, has little difficulty for horses and mules; but camels laden with boards (the mess-table) and long tent-poles must have had a queer time--I should almost expect after this to see an oyster walking up stairs. Of course, they took their leisure, feeling each stone before they trusted it, but they all arrived without the shadow of an accident; and the same was the case during the two subsequent descents.|$|E

50|$|Stage 3 {{is another}} linear walk, from Egton Bridge Station to Whitby.

5000|$|The Mark IIC finally {{remedied}} the {{two major}} problems of the IIA and the IIB, which were the noisy reverb circuit, and a footswitching system that produced a popping noise when activated. The Mark IIC featured a quieter footswitching system based on optocouplers to reroute the signal, and a new mod to the reverb circuit. The reverb modification involved resistor swaps and a change in <b>ground</b> <b>lead</b> placement. That modification {{is still on the}} books of 'official' mods, which they send to their authorized techs; it runs about $50." [...] Mesa/Boogie no longer does this modification at its own factory. The Mark IIC also featured a new Pull Bass shift on the front panel, which slightly extended the low frequencies in the preamp.|$|E

The sky begins to grow more {{turbulent}} as the band walks past flags and boat wreckage, a destroyed bridge, and dead trees. Bassist McKee opens a box he has been carrying and a pale light glows from within. The band removes a pebble-sized, glowing orb from the box. The band members dig a hole for it with their hands, and then drop the orb into the <b>ground.</b> <b>Lead</b> singer Dan Reynolds then shouts, {{and in the next}} scene the band members are shown running away from their dig site. A large explosion throws Reynolds into the air where he seems to levitate (similarly to the Continued Silence album cover). Finally, the sky begins to part and the sunlight shines through.|$|E

5000|$|In {{professional}} student laboratory kits, {{the container}} A is {{often in the}} form of two concentric cylinders of metal screen, open at the top. [...] A screen acts the same as a solid metal sheet for electrostatic charge, as long as its holes are small. The inner cylinder is the Faraday pail container itself, separated from the outer cylinder with insulating supports. The outer cylindrical metal screen surrounds the inner, and acts as a ground to shield it from stray charges. This design largely eliminates the stray charge problem, as well as allowing the experimenter to see inside the container. The electrometer <b>ground</b> <b>lead</b> is clipped to the outer ground screen, and the experimenter touches this screen while performing any procedure. To ground the inner screen, the experimenter can bridge his finger between the inner and outer screens. When doing this it is important that he lift his finger first from the inner screen, not the outer, to avoid leaving charge on the inner screen.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – MOV Distribution class {{lightning}} surge arresters uses <b>ground</b> <b>lead</b> disconnect (GLD) {{to disconnect}} the power system in the case when the surge arrester fails. These GLD are often the most unreliable component in the arrester. Traditionally IEC [1] and other standards have not focussed adequately on this component to ensure its reliability. This paper looks at the most common design of GLD and the duty it will experience. It explains the logic behind the requirements Eskom has introduced {{to ensure that the}} GLD can handle the duty it will be exposed to during its expected life. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigate spin-polarized electron transport {{between a}} permalloy ferromagnet and {{the edge of}} a two-dimensional electron system with band inversion, realized in a narrow, 8 ~nm wide HgTe quantum well. In zero magnetic field, we observe strong asymmetry of the edge potential distribution with respect to the ferromagnetic <b>ground</b> <b>lead.</b> This result indicates, that the helical edge channel, specific for the structures with band inversion even at the conductive bulk, is strongly coupled to the ferromagnetic side contact, possibly due to the effects of proximity magnetization. It allows selective and spin-sensitive contacting of helical edge states. Comment: As appear in JET...|$|E

Traditional {{transmission}} line tower grounding resistance measurements have many shortcomings, {{in order to}} make up the defects the model of {{transmission line}} tower with good conductor wires and multiple <b>grounding</b> <b>leads</b> was builded, and then the algorithm of tower grounding resistance on-line measurement was proposed.

Before Franklin could carry out his experiment, in 1752 Thomas-François Dalibard erected a 40 ft iron rod at Marly-la-Ville, near Paris, drawing sparks from a passing cloud. With ground-insulated aerials, an experimenter could bring a <b>grounded</b> <b>lead</b> with an insulated wax handle close to the aerial, and observe a spark discharge from the aerial to the grounding wire. In May 1752, Dalibard affirmed that Franklin's theory was correct.|$|R
30|$|The {{passage on}} page 56 in this {{manuscript}} {{goes on to}} say ‘And because it would be too difficult to grind it as it is, it must be made red hot in the fire, then once completely red throw it into cold water and it will crumble and become powdery and then be ground easily. After being well ground in a lot of water, it looks like <b>ground</b> <b>lead</b> white, but, despite this, it does not in fact have body.’ The verso of page 57 expands on this last phrase, stating that ‘Crystallin having been ground in water appears to have body, but in oil it does not have any. It is ground with lake and with aspalthe, which will not dry {{for a very long time}} without it.’ As in other treatises, the ground glass is to be mixed with red lake and a black pigment as a siccative.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Independent {{measurements}} of radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes {{and the ground}} heat flux are {{used to describe the}} annual cycle of the surface energy budget at a high-arctic permafrost site on Svalbard. During summer, the net short-wave radiation is the dominant energy source, while well developed turbulent processes and the heat flux in the <b>ground</b> <b>lead</b> to a cooling of the surface. About 15 % of the net radiation is consumed by the seasonal thawing of the active layer in July and August. The Bowen ratio is found to vary between 0. 25 and 2, depending on water content of the upper-most soil layer. During the polar night in winter, the net long-wave radiation is the dominant energy loss channel for the surface, which is mainly compensated by the sensible heat flux and, to a lesser extent, by the ground heat flux, which originates from the refreezing of the active layer.

40|$|The archaeological {{heritage}} is non-renewable, and any invasive research or other actions {{leading to the}} intervention of mechanical or chemical into the <b>ground</b> <b>lead</b> {{to the destruction of}} the archaeological site in whole or in part. For this reason, modern archeology is looking for alternative methods of non-destructive and non-invasive methods of new objects identification. The concept of aerial archeology is relation between the presence of the archaeological site in the particular localization, and the phenomena that in the same place can be observed on the terrain surface form airborne platform. One of the most appreciated, moreover, extremely precise, methods of such measurements is airborne laser scanning. In research airborne laser scanning point cloud with a density of 5 points/sq. m was used. Additionally unmanned aerial vehicle imagery data was acquired. Test area is located in central Europe. The preliminary verification of potentially microstructures localization was the creation of digital terrain and surface models. These models gave an information about the differences in elevation, as well as regular shapes and sizes that can be related to the former settlement/sub-surface feature. The paper presents the results of the detection of potentially sub-surface microstructure fields in the forestry area...|$|E

Grounding grid was {{considered}} as a pure-resistor network and its inner information was obtained through limited <b>grounding</b> <b>leads.</b> A set of diagnostic equations was established based on Tellegen’s theorem. Iteration method and Nonnegative Least Squares method (NNLS) were used to solve it. To verify this method, corrosion diagnosis of single-branch and two-branch was simulated.

This method is able to determine the corrosion position and degree reliably and the optimal plan has higher efficiency and less workload...|$|R
