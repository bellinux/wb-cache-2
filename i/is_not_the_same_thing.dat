But he says pessimism <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid worst-case scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro {{also points out that}} some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic that humanity will act before it is too late.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} debate {{about what would}} have been a more appropriate term. Some scholars, notably Ruth Ross, argue that mana (prestige, authority) would have more accurately conveyed the transfer of sovereignty. However, it has more recently been argued by others, including Judith Binney, that mana would not have been appropriate. This is because mana <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as sovereignty, and also because no-one can give up their mana.|$|E

500|$|This {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a value of 0. [...] A null value indicates a lack of a value - a lack of a value <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as a value of zero in the same way that a lack of an answer <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as an answer of [...] "no". [...] For example, consider the question [...] "How many books does Adam own?" [...] The answer may be [...] "zero" [...] (we know that he owns none) or [...] "null" [...] (we do not know how many he owns). [...] In a database table, the column reporting this answer would start out with no value (marked by Null), and it would not be updated with the value [...] "zero" [...] until we have ascertained that Adam owns no books.|$|E
500|$|Women's yeshivas {{that include}} Talmud {{study on the}} {{curriculum}} often schedule chavrusa study sessions for their students. In Orthodox women's seminaries, students are paired with study partners of equal or greater strength to learn Halakha, Chumash, Jewish philosophy, or any other topic in Judaism. Although the latter set-up is often called [...] "chavrusa learning", it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as what Orthodox men do and is better called [...] "one-on-one study". In recent years, telephone study partnerships for women have been promoted as a kiruv (Jewish outreach) tool in Israel and as an option for busy homemakers.|$|E
500|$|As the {{difference}} between the two prices or quantities increases, the accuracy of the PED given by the formula above decreases for a combination of two reasons. [...] First, the PED for a good is not necessarily constant; as explained below, PED can vary at different points along the demand curve, due to its percentage nature. Elasticity <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as the slope of the demand curve, which is dependent on the units used for both price and quantity. [...] Second, percentage changes are not symmetric; instead, the percentage change between any two values depends on which one is chosen as the starting value and which as the ending value. For example, if quantity demanded increases from 10 units to 15 units, the percentage change is 50%, i.e., (15 − 10) ÷ 10 (converted to a percentage). [...] But if quantity demanded decreases from 15 units to 10 units, the percentage change is −33.3%, i.e., (10 − 15)÷15.|$|E

[...] In California, the fundamental inquiry is always whether the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded a cause of action, [...] not whether the plaintiff has some entitlement to judicial action separate from proof of the substantive {{merits of the claim}} advanced. The court acknowledged that the word [...] "standing" [...] is often sloppily used to refer to what is really jus tertii, and held that jus tertii in state law <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as the federal standing doctrine.|$|E
2500|$|Education {{for girls}} and women was {{originally}} provided within the family, by locals dame schools and public elementary schools, and at female seminaries found in every colony, but limited to young ladies from families with the means to pay tuition and, arguably, still more limited by the focus on providing ladylike accomplishments rather than academic training. These seminaries or academies were usually small and often ephemeral, usually established founded by a single woman or small group of women, they often failed to outlive their founders. In evaluating the many claims of various colleges {{to have been the}} [...] "first" [...] women's college, it is necessary to understand that a number of these 18th- or early 19th-century female seminaries later grew into academic, degree-granting colleges, while others became notable private high schools. However, to have been a female seminary at an early date <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as to have been a women's college at that date.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 February 1840 the {{original}} English {{version of the}} treaty and its translation into Māori were put before a gathering of northern chiefs inside a large marquee on the lawn in front of Busby's house at Waitangi. Hobson read the treaty aloud in English and Williams read his Māori version. In his translation he used a dialect known as [...] "Missionary Māori", which was not traditional Māori, but had been made up by the missionaries. An example {{of this in the}} Treaty is kāwanatanga (governorship), a cognate word which Williams is believed to have transplanted from English. The word kāwanatanga was first used in the Declaration of Independence of New Zealand (1835). It reappeared in 1840 in the Treaty and hence, some argue, was an inappropriate choice. There is considerable debate about what would have been a more appropriate term. Some scholars argue that mana (prestige, authority) would have more accurately conveyed the transfer of sovereignty; although others argue that mana cannot be given away and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as sovereignty.|$|E

2500|$|... {{which is}} known as the {{dispersion}} relation for a free particle. Here one must notice that now, since the particle is not entirely free but under the influence of a potential (the potential V described above), the energy of the particle given above <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as [...] where p is the momentum of the particle, and thus the wavenumber k above actually describes the energy states of the particle, not the momentum states (i.e. {{it turns out that the}} momentum of the particle is not given by [...] ). In this sense, it is quite dangerous to call the number k a wavenumber, since it is not related to momentum like [...] "wavenumber" [...] usually is. The rationale for calling k the wavenumber is that it enumerates the number of crests that the wavefunction has inside the box, and in this sense it is a wavenumber. This discrepancy can be seen more clearly below, when we find out that the energy spectrum of the particle is discrete (only discrete values of energy are allowed) but the momentum spectrum is continuous (momentum can vary continuously) and in particular, the relation [...] for the energy and momentum of the particle does not hold. As said above, the reason this relation between energy and momentum does not hold is that the particle is not free, but there is a potential V in the system, and the energy of the particle is , where T is the kinetic and V the potential energy.|$|E
