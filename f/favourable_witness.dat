5000|$|Magaš {{found out}} and in January 1985 Magaš and his {{associates}} Slobodan [...] "Cane" [...] Savić and Vlada Bačar attempted to kill Vuković and his friend Boris Petkov. Vuković was wounded by Savić. German police arrested Magaš, but he was acquitted {{due to lack of}} evidence. Magaš used his influence around Yugoslav emigre circles to obtain <b>favourable</b> <b>witness</b> testimonies and reportedly even got football coach Fahrudin Jusufi to provide an alibi for his whereabouts {{on the night of the}} shooting.|$|E

2500|$|The inquisitorial process {{consisted}} {{of a series of}} hearings, in which both the denouncers and the defendant gave testimony. A defense counsel was assigned to the defendant, a member of the tribunal itself, whose role was simply to advise the defendant and to encourage them to speak the truth. The prosecution was directed by the fiscal. Interrogation of the defendant was done {{in the presence of the}} Notary of the Secreto, who meticulously wrote down the words of the accused. The archives of the Inquisition, in comparison to those of other judicial systems of the era, are striking in the completeness of their documentation. In order to defend themselves, the accused had two possibilities: abonos (to find <b>favourable</b> <b>witnesses,</b> akin to [...] "substantive" [...] evidence/testimony in Anglo-American law) or tachas (to demonstrate that the witnesses of accusers were not trustworthy, akin to Anglo-American [...] "impeachment" [...] evidence/testimony).|$|R
5000|$|Over {{time the}} {{decisions}} of Finniss became so criticised that the South Australian Government recalled the party {{with the intention of}} holding an inquiry into his conduct. In December 1865 the barque Ellen Lewis left the Northern Territory carrying Finniss and most of the witnesses, including Litchfield, to arrive back at Adelaide in February 1866. [...] Litchfield then appeared as a <b>witness</b> <b>favourable</b> to Finniss at the Northern Territory Commission hearings that took place during March-April 1866.|$|R
5000|$|He must be {{summoned to}} any trial {{in which there}} is question, before a {{competent}} judge, of the validity or nullity of a marriage, and any proceeding will be null if he is not duly cited. He must have the opportunity to examine the witnesses, and, orally or in writing, to bring forward whatever arguments may favour the validity of the marriage. He must be cited even though the party interested in the defence of the marriage be present, and all the acts of the court are always to be accessible to him, and at any time he has a right to bring forward new documents or <b>witnesses</b> <b>favourable</b> to the marriage. On assuming his office he must take an oath to fulfill his duties and he is expected to renew the oath in each case. If the judge decides in favour of the marriage the defender takes no further action unless its opponent appeals to a higher court. Here a defender undertakes anew the defence of its validity. If the judge of the first instance decides against the validity of the marriage and no one else appeals, the defender of marriage has the right to appeal to the higher court. If he feels it his duty to appeal, a new marriage may not be contracted until his plea is heard.|$|R
60|$|The French, {{who have}} never acted a generous part {{in the history of}} the world, readily entered into the views of the Genoese, which accorded with their own policy: for such was their {{ascendancy}} at Genoa, that in subduing Corsica for these allies, they were in fact subduing it for themselves. They entered into the contest, therefore, with their usual vigour, and their usual cruelty. It was in vain that the Corsicans addressed a most affecting memorial to the court of Versailles; that remorseless government persisted in its flagitious project. They poured in troops; dressed a part of them like the people of the country, by which means they deceived and destroyed many of the patriots; cut down the standing corn, the vines, and the olives; set fire to the villages, and hung all the most able and active men who fell into their hands. A war of this kind may be carried on with success against a country so small and so thinly peopled as Corsica. Having reduced the island to perfect servitude, which they called peace, the French withdrew their forces. As soon as they were gone, men, women, and boys rose at once against their oppressors. The circumstances of the times were now favourable to them; and some British ships, acting as allies of Sardinia, bombarded Bastia and San Fiorenzo, and delivered them into the hands of the patriots. This service was long remembered with gratitude: the impression made upon our own countrymen was less <b>favourable.</b> They had <b>witnessed</b> the heartburnings of rival chiefs, and the dissensions among the patriots; and perceiving the state of barbarism to which continual oppression, and habits of lawless turbulence, had reduced the nation, did not recollect that the vices of the people were owing to their unhappy circumstances, but that the virtues which they displayed arose from their own nature. This feeling, perhaps, influenced the British court, when, in 1746, Corsica offered to put herself under the protection of Great Britain: an answer was returned, expressing satisfaction at such a communication, hoping that the Corsicans would preserve the same sentiments, but signifying also that the present was not the time for such a measure.|$|R
