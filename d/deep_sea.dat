Most of the latter are azooxanthellate and live in both shallow and <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> habitats. In the <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> they share the ecosystem with soft corals, polychaete worms, other worms, crustaceans, molluscs and sponges. In the Atlantic Ocean, the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa forms extensive deep-water reefs which support many other species.|$|E

40|$|The <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> {{until the}} late sixties was a largely unknown {{part of the sea}} and {{represented}} nothing more than an academic curiosity. With technology making hitherto hidden depths of the ocean accessible for exploitation, it became known in the late sixties that the <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> contained precious minerals. In a world used to shrinking resources, this shot the <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> into the centre stage of world politics, becoming perhaps the most controversial issue in any United Nations Conference. The controversy centered around the legal status of the <b>deep</b> <b>seabed.</b> This work contends that there is not in place any viable international legal regime for supervising and regulating resource development in the <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> outside national jurisdiction; that whatever regulations there are, are geared towards facilitating exploitation of the area; that such lacunae would be at an environmental cost that could negate whatever short-term benefits are derivable therefrom. This work therefore examines the potential environmental impact of <b>deep</b> <b>seabed</b> mining and proposes a legal regime for preventing and minimizing same...|$|R

5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within striking distance of the fish.|$|E

5|$|In {{many animals}} of the <b>deep</b> <b>sea,</b> {{including}} several squid species, bacterial bioluminescence {{is used for}} camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches the overhead environmental light as seen from below.

These light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria. However, in one species, Euprymna scolopes, the bacteria are an integral component of the animal's light organ.|$|E

5|$|The short-tailed isopods {{have a short}} pleotelson and terminal, stylus-like uropods {{and have}} a {{sedentary}} lifestyle on or under the sediment on the seabed. The long-tailed isopods have a long pleotelson and broad lateral uropods {{which can be used}} in swimming. They are much more active and can launch themselves off the seabed and swim for short distances. The more advanced long-tailed isopods are mostly endemic to the southern hemisphere and may have radiated on the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana soon after it broke away from Laurasia 200 million years ago. The short-tailed forms may have been driven from the shallow seas in which they lived by increased predatory pressure from marine fish, their main predators. The development of the long-tailed forms may also have provided competition that helped force the short-tailed forms into refugia. The latter are now restricted to environments such as the <b>deep</b> <b>sea,</b> freshwater, groundwater and dry land. Isopods in the suborder Asellota are by far the most species-rich group of <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> isopods.|$|E

40|$|In June of 1980, the President of the United States {{signed into}} law the <b>Deep</b> <b>Seabed</b> Hard Mineral Resources Act, a piece of {{national}} legislation that will most definitely have international repercussions.
