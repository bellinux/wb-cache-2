A June 2016 survey, {{conducted}} two {{weeks prior to}} the first election in the new district, found that three quarters of respondents in each prefecture opposed the merger.

25|$|On 6 October 2011 a {{government}} panel proposed {{to ease the}} legal restrictions for exposure to radiation in the contaminated areas with radioactive fallout, because in their opinion it would be extremely difficult to limit exposure below the legal limit of 1 millisievert per year.

Targets should be lowered in steps as decontamination proceeded. Targets might differ by region and residents should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> setting the targets.|$|E
25|$|The {{administration}} initially {{denied the}} union recognition. While the university discouraged {{the formation of}} labor unions, arguing that “it can do more ‘for’ the employee than a union,” Local 77 denounced this idea as “deepening the basic problem,” suggesting that “Employees need to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> their own future; and that voice can only come through collective bargaining...Only then may employees negotiate and sign a contract as mutual, equal participants rather than dependents of a paternal employer with unilateral decision-making power. Only then will the psychology of dependence be overcome.” The black work force had little power in the grievance procedures.|$|E

25|$|The {{crown prince}} (Şehzadeler) lived here in seclusion; therefore, the apartments were also called kafes (cage). The crown prince and other princes {{were trained in}} the {{discipline}} of the Ottoman Harem until they reached adulthood.

From the beginning of the 17th century onward, the princes lived in the Harem, which started to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> the palace administration.

25|$|In January 1917, Germany resumed {{unrestricted}} submarine warfare, {{realizing it}} would mean American entry. The German Foreign Minister, in the Zimmermann Telegram, invited Mexico to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States. In return, the Germans would finance Mexico's war and help it recover the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The United Kingdom intercepted the message and presented it to the U.S. embassy in the U.K. From there it {{made its way to}} President Wilson who released the Zimmermann note to the public, and Americans saw it as casus belli. Wilson called on antiwar elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe. He argued that the war was so important that the U.S. had to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> the peace conference. After the sinking of seven U.S. merchant ships by submarines and the publication of the Zimmermann telegram, Wilson called for war on Germany, which the U.S. Congress declared on 6 April 1917.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, {{opposition}} to Kantakouzenos began to coalesce around three figures: the Patriarch, a forceful man determined to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> {{the governance of}} the Empire, the Empress-regent, who feared that Kantakouzenos would dispossess her son, and {{last but not least}} Alexios Apokaukos, the ambitious megas doux (commander-in-chief of the navy) and head of the bureaucracy. A [...] "new man" [...] promoted to high office as the protégé of Andronikos III and possibly the richest man in the Empire by 1341, Apokaukos was distrusted by the hereditary aristocracy. The only surviving narrative accounts of the period, Kantakouzenos's memoirs and the history of Nikephoros Gregoras, with their pro-aristocracy bias, paint a very negative picture of the man. According to Kantakouzenos, Apokaukos' adherence to the Patriarch's camp resulted from his ambition: Apokaukos sought further advancement by trying to convince Kantakouzenos to declare himself Emperor. When the latter refused, Apokaukos secretly switched his allegiance.|$|E

500|$|The most {{well-documented}} early European {{team was}} founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, [...] "I founded the association late last year , with the fixed resolve of proving {{to the world that}} women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most." [...] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.|$|E

[...] This became an increasingly hard position to support as World War I dragged on.

2500|$|In December 2013, the Canadian Association of University Teachers {{passed a}} {{resolution}} calling on all Canadian universities and colleges that currently host CIs on their campuses to cease doing so, and those contemplating such arrangements to pursue them no further.

CAUT executive director James Turk said Canadian universities that agree to host CIs are compromising their own integrity by allowing the Hanban to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> academic matters such as curriculum, texts, and topics of class discussion, describing such interference as a [...] "fundamental violation of academic freedom."
