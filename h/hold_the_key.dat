25|$|An unusual species, Turritopsis dohrnii, {{formerly}} {{classified as}} T. nutricula, might be effectively immortal {{because of its}} ability under certain circumstances to transform from medusa back to the polyp stage, thereby escaping the death that typically awaits medusae post-reproduction if they have not otherwise been eaten by some other ocean organism. So far this reversal has been observed only in the laboratory. At least one professor at the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory at Kyoto University in Japan has concluded {{that there are three}} species of jellyfish that are immortal, and says their immortality may <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to immortality for human beings, as he says that genetically they are not that much different from humans.|$|E

25|$|The War of the Second Coalition in {{northern}} Italian {{began with the}} inconclusive Battle of Verona on 26 March 1799 between the Habsburg Austrian army of Paul Kray and the Republican French Army of Italy under Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer. The subsequent Battle of Magnano on 5 April was a clear-cut victory by Kray over the French, with the Austrians sustaining 6,000 casualties while inflicting losses of 8,000 men and 18 guns on their foes. The defeat was a crushing blow to French morale and prompted Schérer to plead with the French Directory to be relieved of command. Finding his strong position behind the Mincio River outflanked on the north by 12,000 Austrians, Schérer left 12,000 troops to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> fortress of Mantua, directed 1,600 more to defend Peschiera del Garda and retreated to the west on 12 April. Two days later, Alexander Suvorov arrived at Vicenza with a Imperial Russian army and assumed command of the combined Austro-Russian forces.|$|E

Civilians are herded into safe rooms, but despite the precautions, Don breaks into a room containing a large crowd and starts a domino effect of rapid infection. The mob - now with half its members infected - breaks out of the safe room and into the streets. Scarlet, a U.S. Army medical officer, rescues Tammy and Andy as the soldiers in District One are ordered to shoot indiscriminately. Doyle, unable to bring himself to comply with the order, abandons his post and escapes with Scarlet, Tammy, Andy, and several others through the Greenwich Foot Tunnel. General Stone orders District One to be firebombed, but large numbers of the infected, including Don, escape the bombardment. Scarlet informs Doyle that the children might <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to a cure and must be protected at all costs. Flynn arrives by helicopter to pick up Doyle, but he refuses to take anyone else, as they would be shot down for carrying people who are possibly infected.|$|E

After Scully examines the shards, {{she begins to}} believe that they <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to all of life's mysteries. Meanwhile, Mulder slips into a coma, and Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) enlists the help of former Department of Defense agent Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) to determine what is wrong with Mulder. The two discover that while Mulder's condition has made him unresponsive, it has given him telepathic powers. Scully, working in Africa, witnesses several strange events relating to the wreck before returning to Washington.|$|E

500|$|According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, {{the song}} is {{influenced}} by the Sly and the Family Stone track [...] "Family Affair" [...] (1971). It starts as the sound of slap bass plays along with sequenced synth bass, as Madonna sings the opening lines, [...] "Keep, keep it together, keep people together forever and ever". As the first verse starts, a guitar comes into play with Madonna's voice being backed by percussion and banjo. After the second chorus comes near the end, Madonna utters the line [...] "Brothers and sisters, They <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>key,</b> To your heart and your soul, Don't forget that your family is gold", the percussion sound is thinned out and a mixture of the sound from a live drummer and conga comes into the picture.

500|$|According to McIlwain, {{the episode}} {{represents}} the series' ultimate [...] "coalescence of science, religion, and metaphysics". It {{is one of}} the few episodes in which Scully sets aside her empirical reasoning to save Mulder's life. Scully, representing the more rational one [...] "who must anchor herself in the certainty of scientific facts", discovers the alien shards and deduces that they <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to [...] "every question that has ever been asked". Mulder, on the other hand, represents the one who [...] "seeks the truth among a realm of possibilities too fantastic and beyond the realm of scientific validity" [...] and possesses the needed tool—his immunity—to solve the puzzle. The episode also explores the moral side of The Smoking Man and his affinity for evil. Kenneth Silber of Space.com notes that The Smoking Man's [...] "enticing blandishments confirm he is a highly dangerous foe, one whose Machiavellian creativity borders on the Satanic." [...] Timothy Dunn and Joseph J. Foy note in [...] "Moral Musings on a Cigarette Smoking Man" [...] that The Smoking Man's evil deeds have little to do with his mission in the Syndicate, instead reflecting his desire for [...] "completely gratuitous" [...] evil. The two cite his line [...] "Aren't you expecting me to sprout vampire fangs?" [...] as evidence that The Smoking Man is aware of his crimes but casually shrugs them off.|$|E

It has called for a new era of water investments and policies for upgrading rainfed agriculture that would go beyond controlling field-level soil and water to bring new freshwater sources through better local management of rainfall and runoff. Increased agricultural productivity enables farmers to grow more food, which translates into better diets and, under market conditions that offer a level playing field, into higher farm incomes. With more money, farmers are more likely to diversify production and grow higher-value crops, benefiting not only themselves but the economy as a whole." ...|$|E
