5|$|Czolgosz {{had lost}} his job during the {{economic}} Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy adhered to by recent killers of foreign leaders. Regarding McKinley {{as a symbol of}} oppression, Czolgosz was convinced that it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him. Unable to <b>get</b> <b>near</b> the President during the presidential visit earlier, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasite}} is the nematode Beddingia (Deladenus) siricidicola, {{which was}} {{suggested in the}} New World in the 1970s as a possible biological control. B. siricidicola causes infertility in female wasps, but does not impair the fertility of males. Inside the host tree, the nematodes primarily feed on fungal mycelium. If they <b>get</b> <b>near</b> the wasp larvae, they infect females, which then couple with males and finally infest the wasp larvae. These eventually exit the tree carrying the nematodes with them. Competition for food between B. siricidicola and the wasp larvae also occurs, resulting in slower growth and possible starvation of the woodwasp larvae. The population of the Sirex woodwasp is very prone to infestation by B. siricidicola; infestation rates of up to 90% have been recorded. The nematodes are often used to combat the wasps by combining them with the symbiosis partner Amylostereum. The related species B. wilsoni has a similar effect, but as it also lives parasitically with the genus Rhyssa, it is not used for pest control.|$|E

5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to <b>get</b> <b>near</b> the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E
5|$|Papa Stour's {{most recent}} {{shipwreck}} occurred on 9 December 1977 when the Aberdeen trawler Elinor Viking A278, skipper Alec Flett, foundered on the Ve Skerries. The Aith Lifeboat {{came to the}} scene {{but was unable to}} <b>get</b> <b>near</b> enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions. At the request of Alec Webster, Coastguard Station Officer, Lerwick, a volunteer crew in a British Airways Sikorsky S61N helicopter from Sumburgh Airport was scrambled. They managed to winch all the boat's crew to safety within hours of the grounding, despite the storm force winds. The helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery. There was no loss of life, but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the skerries in 1979, and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit, based at Sumburgh Airport.|$|E
25|$|The Burmese {{would not}} make any {{progress}} against a better-led Siam, now based in Bangkok, in the future. This was the last war in which the Burmese were able to <b>get</b> <b>near</b> Ayutthaya, and achieve territorial gains. The Burmese performance got progressively worse over the next decades, and lost territory. They managed to penetrate to central Siam in 1775–1776 but were decisively defeated at the border in 1785–1786, after which the Burmese would no longer attempt another full-scale invasion.|$|E

25|$|The North American F-108 Rapier was {{the first}} {{proposed}} successor to the F-106. It was {{to be capable of}} Mach 3 performance and was intended to serve as a long-range interceptor that could destroy attacking Soviet bombers over the poles before they could <b>get</b> <b>near</b> US territory. It was also to serve as the escort fighter for the XB-70 Valkyrie Mach-3 strategic bomber, also to be built by North American. The Air Force expected that the first F-108A would be ready for service by early 1963. An order for no less than 480 F-108s was anticipated.|$|E
25|$|Realising {{that they}} had less than four months before the rainy season, the Burmese command {{initially}} launched a few assaults on the city walls. But the place proved too strong and too well defended. Because of the numerous stockades outside the city, the Burmese could not even <b>get</b> <b>near</b> the wall, and those that got near were cut down by musket fire from atop. The Burmese now drew a line of entrenchments round the city, and prepared to reduce it by famine. As time passed and no signs of surrender appeared, {{the approach of the}} dreaded rainy season caused alarm among the Burmese command. Several senior commanders advised calling off the invasion. However, Maha Nawrahta decided to continue the invasion, and his colleague Thihapate supported him. The Burmese command now made preparations to meet the rise of the river by collecting boats and building embankments on the bits of high ground.|$|E

25|$|This {{strike was}} carried on by sampan-men of all ethnicities. The sampan-men had earlier on been fined heavily for insisting that {{passengers}} {{pay more than}} the two cents per passenger each way to and from steamers within the inner harbour and four cents to vessels in the outer harbour set down in the Harbour Rules for Sampans. While some viewed this as extortion there were cases mentioned where passengers gave more than the rules called for, of their own accord. The case where a passenger gave 30 cents and the sampan-man was fined $20 {{is said to have}} led to the leaders of the sampan-men initiating the strike. The sampan-men found the prohibition on repairing their boats along Weld Quay a hardship and the fares dictated by the Harbour Rules inadequate. The prohibition, apparently came about because of complaints from tongkang-men who were unable to <b>get</b> <b>near</b> to Weld Quay, being obstructed by sampans laid up for repair. The strike was said to have involved 150 sampans.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} recorded use of {{the word}} [...] "cootie" [...] appears in Albert N. Depew's [...] World War I memoir, Gunner Depew (1918): [...] "Of course you know what the word 'cooties' means....When you <b>get</b> <b>near</b> the trenches you get a course in the natural history of bugs, lice, rats and every kind of pest that had ever been invented." [...] The word may be derived from Malaysian kutu, a head louse. In North American English, children use the word to refer to a fictitious disease or condition, often infecting members of the opposite sex. Among children, the word [...] effectively serves as a device for enforcing separation of the sexes.|$|E

500|$|To {{kick off}} the band's European tour, the band staged a free show in Moscow's Red Square, on August 14, 1999, to a crowd of over 200,000.

[...] Following the European leg, the group did a show in New York City, at the Windows on the World, for KROQ radio contest-winners, {{and then at the}} Big Day Out festival in Australia following several Japanese tour dates. Flea, however, began to feel the repercussions of touring causing the band to set up concerts that were less strenuous, and consequently less financially rewarding, for them. These shows would finish the remainder of the Californication tour. As one of the last shows before the release of their next album By the Way, the Chili Peppers played Rock in Rio 3.|$|E

In the pilot episode, when her parents are killed in the first meteor shower, Lana is adopted by her aunt Nell (Sarah-Jane Redmond).

500|$|Around 6:30 pm on {{the evening}} of Friday, December 26, 1873, the three-story Orange Hotel station depot caught fire. Some staff of the re-christened Erie Railroad were {{examining}} a room in the roof of the building, and upon looking into it, found it engulfed in smoke. The fire quickly spread, consuming the entire story. There was a lull, but the building re-ignited as flames continued through the building. The Mansard roof on top of the building was destroyed by the flames. No fire-ridding materials to douse the blaze were available to staff and no one could <b>get</b> <b>near</b> the building to inspect where the flames were. The flames finally destroyed the entire building, and just two hours after the fire was discovered, the walls began to collapse on the structure. Within a half-hour, the entire hotel/depot had collapsed and was a pile of brick ruins. Train service on the Erie main line was disrupted for several hours due to the fire and station depot collapse. A later study determined the station depot burned down due to a defective flue.|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} eight episode [...] "Bride", Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley), believing he is {{tracking}} Lex Luthor {{who has been}} missing since the season seven finale, discovers Lana instead. Oliver convinces her to return to Smallville {{so that she can}} attend Chloe's wedding. In the season eight episode [...] "Power", it is revealed that Lana really returned so that she could steal Lex's [...] "Prometheus" [...] technology, which harnesses alien DNA to give the wearer of a [...] "super-suit" [...] superhuman abilities, for herself. By the end of the episode, the procedure is complete, and Lana becomes just as strong and invulnerable as Clark. In the episode [...] "Requiem", Lana discovers that her suit absorbs kryptonite, but also emits the radiation making her a potential danger to Clark. When Winslow Schott puts a kryptonite bomb {{on the roof of the}} Daily Planet, Lana is forced to absorb all of the kryptonite to deactivate the bomb. As a result, she leaves Smallville to go on her own quest as Clark can no longer <b>get</b> <b>near</b> her without the kryptonite radiation hurting him.|$|E
