5|$|The University Educational Trust (UET) is a 501 (c)(3) tax-exempt {{organization}} {{serving as}} a source of external fund-raising, funds-management and revenue-distribution at Cal Poly Pomona. With diminishing state support in recent years, the university has become not fully state-supported, but rather, state-assisted. UET oversees Cal Poly's endowment and generates resources with help of public and private partners to complement state-support and is recognized by the CSU Board of Trustees as a Title V auxiliary organization. It has a total capacity for up to 35 members and currently includes 4 officers, 18 community representatives, and 5 university representatives. The board of directors is composed of the university president who acts as an <b>ex</b> <b>officio</b> voting director and who appoints one <b>ex</b> <b>officio</b> executive director, one faculty member, one student member, and either the vice president for administrative affairs or the chief financial officer.

5|$|Bo {{took up the}} Chongqing post on 30 November, a month {{following}} {{the conclusion of the}} Congress, even though Wang Yang had vacated the position on 13 November. Whilst some saw this transfer as a 'banishment' from the central government to the hinterlands to keep Bo's perceived arrogance and high-profile antics out of Beijing's view, others considered it a promotion since being the party chief in one of the four direct-controlled municipalities came with an <b>ex</b> <b>officio</b> seat on the Politburo.|$|E
5|$|De Saulles {{created the}} new florin {{in this manner}} to {{distinguish}} the coin from the half crown, as there had been complaints of confusion. He probably based the design on his British trade dollar (1895). The sitter for the design was Susan Hicks-Beach, the daughter of Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and <b>ex</b> <b>officio</b> Master of the Mint. The modern-day Britannia coinage, bullion pieces struck by the Royal Mint for investors and collectors, has a reverse that strongly resembles that of the Edwardian florin.|$|E

5|$|The Hong Kong {{government}} generally {{respects the}} human rights of its citizens, and members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong and the District Council of Hong Kong are elected into office by Hong Kong citizens. However, there are 27 <b>ex</b> <b>officio</b> members of the district council (the Rural Committee Chairmen in the New Territories) as of the fifth District Council Assembly, and roughly half of the legislative council seats are elected by 3% of the people in Hong Kong through the functional constituency. The imbalance of voting power in the LegCo has led to widespread criticism of its inability to represent Hongkongers' socio-economic needs. In addition, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong is elected by 1,200 members based on their contributions to four different sectors of Hong Kong's society. This policy has received criticism from various political figures in Hong Kong, and led to the Umbrella Revolution. Plans to expand the voting population had begun to appear in the 2000s, and political figures liaised with the government to provide universal suffrage.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} Register {{has been held}} by the Dean of Windsor since 1558. The Garter Principal King of Arms is <b>ex</b> <b>officio</b> the senior officer of the College of Arms (the heraldic {{authority}} of England), and is usually appointed from among the other officers of arms at the College. As the title suggests, Garter Principal King of Arms has specific duties as the Order's officer of arms, attending to the companions' crests and banners of arms, which are exhibited in the chapel. The Secretary, who acts as deputy to Garter in the ceremonial aspects of the Order, has since 1952 also been selected from the other officers of the College of Arms.

5|$|In 1967, Brooke-Little was {{advanced}} {{to the position of}} Richmond Herald. On 7 July 1980, after almost thirty years of service to the Earl Marshal and the College of Arms, Brooke-Little was appointed to replace Sir Walter Verco as Norroy and Ulster King of Arms, with heraldic authority in the part of England north of the Trent, as well as in Northern Ireland. While serving in that office, he enjoyed telling people that the commonly held view that the Order of Saint Patrick was extinct was quite false. Brooke-Little believed that as the Ulster King of Arms ‚Äì the capacity in which he handled Northern Irish heraldry ‚Äì he remained <b>ex</b> <b>officio</b> an Officer of the Order. As the holder of that office, he and his successors would remain the Order's King of Arms, Registrar and Knight Attendant, until such time as the Sovereign should choose formally to abolish the office of Ulster King of Arms or to declare that these positions are not vested in the office. The fact that the last knight had died in 1974 was of little consequence to such a staunch traditionalist.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial War Museum is an {{executive}} non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, {{from which it}} receives financial support {{in the form of}} a grant-in-aid. The governance of the museum is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees, originally established by the Imperial War Museum Act 1920, later amended by the Imperial War Museum Act 1955 and the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 and other relevant legislation. The board comprises a president (currently Prince Edward, Duke of Kent) who is appointed by the sovereign, and fourteen members appointed in varying proportions by the Prime Minister, and the Foreign, Defence, and Culture Secretaries. Seven further members are Commonwealth High Commissioners appointed <b>ex</b> <b>officio</b> by their respective governments.

During the Second World War Grandy had commanded RAF Duxford, and was chairman during the planning of Duxford's American Air Museum, which opened in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} predecessor of the Cabinet was the Executive Council of the Straits Settlements, {{introduced in}} 1877 {{to advise the}} Governor of the Straits Settlements. It wielded no executive power. In 1955, a Council of Ministers was created, made up of three <b>ex</b> <b>officio</b> Official Members and six Elected Members of the Legislative Assembly of Singapore, appointed by the Governor {{on the recommendation of}} the Leader of the House. Following the general elections that year, David Saul Marshall became the first Chief Minister of Singapore. Constitutional talks between Legislative Assembly representatives and the Colonial Office were held from 1956 to 1958, and Singapore gained full internal self-government in 1959. The Governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, who had power to appoint to the post of Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Assembly, and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister's advice. In the 1959 general elections, the People's Action Party swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly, and Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore. The executive branch of the Singapore Government remained unchanged following Singapore's merger with Malaysia in 1963, and subsequent independence in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The state {{constitution}} has provided since 1777 {{for the election}} of a lieutenant governor, who is also <b>ex</b> <b>officio</b> president of the state senate, to the same term (keeping the same term lengths as the governor throughout all the constitutional revisions). Originally, in the event of the death, resignation or impeachment of the governor, the lieutenant governor would become acting governor {{until the end of the}} yearly legislative term, the office being filled in a special election, if there was a remainder of the term. Since the 1821 constitution, the lieutenant governor explicitly becomes governor upon such vacancy in the office and serves for the entire remainder of the term. Should the office of lieutenant governor become vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate performs all the duties of the lieutenant governor until the vacancy is filled either at the next gubernatorial election or by appointment. Likewise, should both offices become vacant at the same time, the president pro tempore acts as governor, with the office of lieutenant governor remaining vacant. Should the presidency pro tempore be vacant too, or the incumbent unable to fulfill the duties, the speaker of the assembly is next in the line of succession. The lieutenant governor is elected on the same ticket as the governor, since 1954 with a single joint vote cast for both offices, but is nominated separately.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas brought upon {{numerous}} {{political changes}} and introduced a civic {{government of the}} Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia as part of Austria-Hungary, which in turn proceeded to absorb the Croatian and Slavonian Military Frontiers in 1881. During {{the second half of}} the 19th century Croatian counties went through various reorganizations (1848-1850, 1850-1854, 1854-1861, 1861-1870, 1870-1874, 1874-1886, 1886-1914) that also reflected the position of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia within the Austrian Empire (after 1867 the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy); the last major reorganisation of the counties was in 1886, when eight counties were established within the kingdom. This layout largely remained in effect until the Croatian counties were abolished in 1922, while some minor adjustments of county boundaries happened in 1913. The counties were set up as self-governmental units in contrast to earlier county incarnations since the Middle Ages. Each had an assembly (Croatian ≈æupanijska skup≈°tina) with the wealthiest taxpayers comprising half the assembly members and elected members comprising the remaining half. Supreme prefect (Croatian veliki ≈æupan) was appointed by the king and county officials by the ban. Managing board of each county had 6 members elected by the county assembly, while the remaining members were county officials <b>ex</b> <b>officio</b> (supreme prefect, viceprefect, county health supervisor etc). Counties were divided into districts (Croatian kotari as government units similar to Austrian Bezirke), while municipalities (Croatian opƒáine) and cities (Croatian gradovi) were units of local self-government.|$|E
5|$|The power {{contest between}} the allied Military Committee and the Regionalists against the National Command was fought out {{within the party}} {{structure}}. However, the Military Committee and the Regionalists managed to turn the party structure on its head. At the 2nd Regional Congress (held in March 1965), {{it was decided to}} endorse the principle that the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command would be the <b>ex</b> <b>officio</b> head of state, and the Regional Command acquired the power to appoint the prime minister, the cabinet, the chief of staff, and the top military commanders. This change curtailed the powers of the National Command, who thenceforth had very little say in Syrian internal affairs. In response, at the 8th National Congress (April 1965) Aflaq had originally planned to launch an attack on the Military Committee and the Regionalists, but was persuaded not to by fellow National Command members ‚Äì most notably by a Lebanese member, Jibran Majdalani, and a Saudi member, Ali Ghannam ‚Äì because it could lead to the removal of the party's civilian leadership, as had occurred in the Iraqi Regional Branch. Because of this decision, Aflaq was voted from office as Secretary General, to be succeeded by fellow National Command member Munif al-Razzaz. Razzaz was a Syrian-born Jordanian who was not rooted enough in party politics to solve the crisis, even if under his command several joint meetings of the National and Regional Commands took place. Not longer after Aflaq's loss of office, Hafiz, the Secretary of the Regional Command, changed his allegiance to support the National Command. While Hafiz was the de jure leader of Syria (he held the offices of Regional Command secretary, Chairman of the Presidential Council, prime minister and commander-in-chief), it was Jadid, the Assistant Secretary General of the Regional Command, who was the de facto leader of Syria.|$|E
