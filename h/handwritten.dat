5|$|In 2013, UNESCO inscribed a {{collection}} of Khachaturian's <b>handwritten</b> notes and film music in the Memory of the World Register.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, {{more than}} one edition of the Cronica was {{available}} in printed form. There was also an abundance of <b>handwritten</b> illuminated manuscripts, including one from Venice by Bartholomeo Zanetti Casterzagense in 1537 and one from Florence by Lorenzo Torrentino in 1554.|$|E
5|$|IPA letters have <b>handwritten</b> forms {{designed}} for use in manuscripts and when taking field notes; they are occasionally seen in publications when the printer did not have fonts that supported IPA, and the IPA was therefore filled in by hand.|$|E
5|$|Messages now {{allows users}} to send <b>handwritten</b> notes. This is done by turning the device to {{landscape}} mode for iPhones (landscape or portrait for iPad users) and then tapping the handwriting squiggle. The Messages app automatically saves recently used notes, {{to make it easier}} to send them again. A <b>handwritten</b> message can be deleted in the same way an app is deleted; by holding down on the message and pressing Delete. The message can also be saved as a picture file.|$|E
5|$|Rowling {{also decided}} to create a seventh <b>handwritten</b> copy (distinguished from the others by its {{moonstone}} jewelling) to sell at auction {{in order to raise}} funds for The Children's Voice charity campaign.|$|E
5|$|Seven copies were {{auctioned}} off in London by Sotheby's. Each was illustrated and <b>handwritten</b> by Rowling and is 157 pages. It was bound in brown Moroccan leather and embellished with five hand-chased hallmarked sterling silver ornaments and mounted moonstones.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages (two {{other books}} {{mentioned}} in the Harry Potter novels that have also been printed) the standard and collector's editions of The Tales of Beedle the Bard feature commentary and footnotes from Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts {{and one of the}} main characters of the series. The standard edition also includes illustrations reproduced from the <b>handwritten</b> edition auctioned in December 2007 and the introduction by the author. The limited collector's edition features ten illustrations by J.K. Rowling not included in the standard edition or the original handcrafted edition, as well as an exclusive reproduction of J.K. Rowling's <b>handwritten</b> introduction, and other miscellaneous objects such as replica gemstones and an emerald ribbon.|$|E
5|$|For extra security, {{the photos}} must contain the stamped or <b>handwritten</b> {{address of the}} studio and the exact date they were taken. In addition, a {{declaration}} and signatures made by a guarantor and mukhtar are required, as they must certify the photos are true likeliness of the applicant.|$|E
5|$|For {{four months}} {{beginning}} in late 1956, Eichmann was extensively interviewed by Nazi expatriate journalist Willem Sassen {{with the intention}} of producing a biography. Tapes, transcripts, and <b>handwritten</b> notes by Eichmann were produced. The memoirs were later used as the basis for a series of articles that appeared in Life and Der Stern magazines in late 1960.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's {{name was}} printed, not signed, on the Dunlap broadside; his iconic {{signature}} appears {{on a different}} document—a sheet of parchment that was carefully <b>handwritten</b> sometime after July 19 and signed on August 2 by Hancock and those delegates present. Known as the engrossed copy, this is the famous document {{on display at the}} National Archives in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|The English-language Adventures of Tintin {{books were}} {{originally}} published with <b>handwritten</b> lettering created by cartographer Neil Hyslop. 1958's The Crab With the Golden Claws {{was the first}} to be published with Hyslop's lettering. Hyslop was given versions of Hergé's artwork with blank panels. Hyslop would write his English script on a clear cellophane-like material, aiming to fit within the original speech bubble. Occasionally the size of the bubbles would need to be adjusted if the translated text would not fit. In the early 2000s, Tintin's English publishers Egmont discontinued publishing books featuring Hyslop's <b>handwritten</b> lettering, instead publishing books with text created with digital fonts. This change was instigated by publisher Casterman and Hergé's estate managers Moulinsart, who decided to replace localised hand-lettering with a single computerised font for all Tintin titles worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The Flyers {{claimed that}} the Nordiques had reneged on their agreement, and filed a {{complaint}} with the NHL. The NHL appointed Larry Bertuzzi, a lawyer from Toronto, as the arbitrator of the conflict. Bertuzzi held a five-day hearing after the 1992 draft, in which he reviewed over 400 pages of <b>handwritten</b> notes and called 11 witnesses, including Lindros.|$|E
5|$|The {{fifth-generation}} LS {{also features}} 3D-surround Mark Levinson audio with in-ceiling array speakers. Its next-generation, remote touch infotainment interface called Lexus Enform, {{is said to}} be designed to mimic smartphone operation, with support for <b>handwritten</b> input. Alongside the 12.3inch navigation display, the fifth-generation LS can be specified with an optional 24inch, colour HUD for the driver’s view. The fifth-generation LS will be launched in Japan at the end of 2017 and globally in early 2018.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} typewritten {{copy of the}} speech, including King's <b>handwritten</b> {{notes on}} it, was discovered in 1984 {{to be in the}} hands of George Raveling, the first African-American basketball coach of the University of Iowa. In 1963, Raveling, then 26, was standing near the podium, and immediately after the oration, impulsively asked King if he could have his copy of the speech. He got it.|$|E
5|$|There {{are nearly}} 100,000 hatt-ı hümayuns in the Ottoman {{archives}} in Istanbul. Among the more famous are the Edict (hatt-ı şerîf) of Gülhane of 1839 and the Imperial Reform Edict (hatt-ı hümayun) of 1856. For this last one, the Turkish term Tanzimat Fermanı is more accurate. This decree, which started the so-called Tanzimat reforms, is so called because it carries a <b>handwritten</b> order by the sultan {{to the grand}} vizier to execute his command.|$|E
5|$|When {{service from}} Union Station was inaugurated in 1928, both {{eastbound}} and westbound trains were departing the station almost every hour bound for destinations across the United States. Passengers in the station's expansive waiting room could patronize its news stand, telegraph office, barber shop, shoeshine stand, or its lunch counter and soda fountain. Train schedules were <b>handwritten</b> {{on a large}} blackboard, while station staff announced the arrival and impending departures of the trains by megaphone.|$|E
5|$|A new {{special edition}} was {{released}} in December 2014, commemorating the 20th anniversary of the album. This edition includes the vinyl edition of the full album, plus a three-CD set, the first CD with the full album remastered for the special release, the second with the US mix remastered and the third including a performance at the Astoria in 1994 and an acoustic session for Radio 4 Mastertapes in 2014. The special edition also contains a 40-page book full of rare photos and <b>handwritten</b> lyrics and notes by Richey and by the band.|$|E
5|$|After Congress {{approved}} the final {{wording of the}} Declaration on July 4, a <b>handwritten</b> copy was sent {{a few blocks away}} to the printing shop of John Dunlap. Through the night, Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides for distribution. Before long, the Declaration was read to audiences and reprinted in newspapers throughout the thirteen states. The first official public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8; public readings also took place on that day in Trenton, New Jersey and Easton, Pennsylvania. A German translation of the Declaration was published in Philadelphia by July 9.|$|E
5|$|Austin-based theatre company The Hidden Room {{developed}} a staged reading of John Wilkes Booth's Richard III {{based on the}} manuscript promptbook {{in the collection of}} the Harry Ransom Center. The promptbook is one of only two known surviving promptbooks created by John Wilkes Booth, and uses the Colley Cibber adaptation of Shakespeare's text. The full book with the actor's <b>handwritten</b> notations has been digitized. The other promptbook is also for Richard III, and can be found in the Harvard Theatre Collection.|$|E
5|$|By 1870, Morris {{had become}} a public figure in Britain, {{resulting}} in repeated press requests for photographs, which he despised. That year, he also reluctantly agreed to sit for a portrait by establishment painter George Frederic Watts. Morris was keenly interested in Icelandic literature, having befriended the Icelandic theologian Eiríkr Magnússon. Together they produced prose translations of the Eddas and Sagas for publication in English. Morris also developed {{a keen interest in}} creating <b>handwritten</b> illuminated manuscripts, producing 18 such books between 1870 and 1875, the first of which was A Book of Verse, completed as a birthday present for Georgina Burne-Jones. 12 of these 18 were <b>handwritten</b> copies of Nordic tales such as Halfdan the Black, Frithiof the Bold, and The Dwellers of Eyr. Morris deemed calligraphy to be an art form, and taught himself both Roman and italic script, as well as learning how to produce gilded letters. In November 1872 he published Love is Enough, a poetic drama based on a story in the Medieval Welsh text, the Mabinogion. Illustrated with Burne-Jones woodcuts, it was not a popular success. By 1871, he had begun work on a novel set in the present, The Novel on Blue Paper, which was about a love triangle; it would remain unfinished and Morris later asserted that it was not well written.|$|E
5|$|Considerable non-printed {{material}} in the Deseret alphabet was made, including a replica headstone in Cedar City, Utah, some coinage, letters, diaries, and meeting minutes. One of the more curious items found in the Deseret alphabet is an English-Hopi dictionary prepared by two Mormon missionaries. It sat unappreciated in <b>handwritten</b> form at the LDS Church Archives until 2014, when Kenneth R. Beesley, a writing system researcher and computer scientist, noticed its significance and transcribed it into standard written English.|$|E
5|$|In early 1996, former FBI hostage {{negotiator}} {{and criminal}} profiler Clinton R. Van Zandt was contacted by an investigator working with Bisceglie. Bisceglie asked Van Zandt {{to compare the}} manifesto to typewritten copies of <b>handwritten</b> letters David had received from his brother. Van Zandt's initial analysis determined that there was better than a 60 percent chance that the same person had written the letters {{as well as the}} manifesto, which had been in public circulation for half a year. Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an even higher likelihood that the letters and the manifesto were the product of the same author. He recommended that Bisceglie's client immediately contact the FBI.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki is {{best known}} for her The Tale of Genji, a three-part novel {{spanning}} 1100 pages and 54 chapters, which is thought to have taken a decade to complete. The earliest chapters were possibly written for a private patron either during her marriage or shortly after her husband's death. She continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to Shōshi. She would have needed patronage to produce a work of such length. Michinaga provided her with costly paper and ink, and with calligraphers. The first <b>handwritten</b> volumes were probably assembled and bound by ladies-in-waiting.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1992 Lennon's <b>handwritten</b> lyrics {{were sold}} by the estate of Mal Evans in an auction at Sotheby's London for $100,000 (£56,600). The lyrics were put up for sale again in March 2006 by Bonhams in New York. Sealed bids were opened on 7 March 2006 and offers started at about $2 million. The lyric sheet was {{auctioned}} again by Sotheby's in June 2010. It was purchased by an anonymous American buyer who paid $1,200,000 (£810,000).|$|E
5|$|Originally The Tales of Beedle the Bard {{had only}} been {{produced}} in {{a limited number of}} seven handmade copies, all <b>handwritten</b> and illustrated by the author herself. The books were bound in brown morocco leather, and decorated with hand-chased silver ornaments and mounted semiprecious stones by silversmith and jeweller Hamilton & Inches of Edinburgh. Each of the silver pieces represents one of the five stories in the book. Rowling also asked that each of the seven copies be embellished using a different semiprecious stone.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2007, the {{aircraft}} had been marketed under the designation EH101. The original designation was EHI 01 but a transcription error of a <b>handwritten</b> note changed this to EH101 and the designation stuck. In 2000, Westland Helicopters and Agusta merged to form AgustaWestland, {{leading to the}} type's redesignation as AW101. The type first flew in 1987, and entered into service in 1999. Since the AW101's introduction, it has replaced several older helicopter types, such as the Sea King, performing roles such as medium-sized transport, anti-submarine warfare, and ship-based utility operations.|$|E
5|$|Several other book {{collections}} {{were lost}} as well. Professor Mathias Anchersen {{made the mistake}} of bringing his possessions to safety in Trinitatis Church. Árni Magnússon lost all his books, notes and records, but did manage to rescue his valuable collection of <b>handwritten</b> Icelandic manuscripts. At Borchs Kollegium 3,150volumes burned along with its Museum Rarirorum containing collections of zoological and botanical oddities. The burned out observatory in Rundetårn had contained instruments and records by Tycho Brahe and Ole Rømer. The professors Horrebow, Steenbuch and the two Bartholins lost practically everything. And {{on top of all that}} a large part of the city archive of records burnt along with city hall.|$|E
5|$|Six {{of these}} {{original}} <b>handwritten</b> copies were uniquely dedicated and given by Rowling to six {{people who were}} most involved with the Harry Potter series. The recipients of these copies were not initially identified. Since then, two {{of these people have}} been named. One is Barry Cunningham, Rowling's very first editor. Another is Arthur A. Levine, editor for Scholastic, the U.S. publisher of the Harry Potter books. Cunningham and Levine had lent their personal copies as part of Beedle the Bard exhibits in December 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Mobile Municipal Archives {{contains}} the extant {{records of the}} City of Mobile, dating from the city's creation as a municipality by the Mississippi Territory in 1814. The majority of the original records of Mobile's colonial history, spanning the years 1702 through 1813, are housed in Paris, London, Seville, and Madrid. The Mobile Genealogical Society Library and Media Center {{is located at the}} Holy Family Catholic Church and School complex. It features <b>handwritten</b> manuscripts and published materials that are available for use in genealogical research.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{originally}} produced {{in a limited}} edition of only seven copies, each <b>handwritten</b> and illustrated by J. K. Rowling. One of them was offered for auction through Sotheby's in late 2007 and was expected to sell for £50,000 (US$77,000, €69,000); ultimately it was bought for £1.95million ($3million, €2.7million) by Amazon, making the selling price the highest achieved at auction for a modern literary manuscript. The money earned at the auction of the book was donated to The Children's Voice charity campaign.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{second floor}} houses the library. It {{contains}} the scriptures of Gyetengpa, Doduipa, Mamtha, Kangyur, Tengyur and Zungdui, {{which have been}} affected due to insect attacks. The collection in the library consists of two printed books of Tengyur (in 25 volumes), which are commentaries on Buddhist teachings; three sets of Kangyur, the translated version of the canons of Buddhist teachings; and Chanjia Sangbhums in five volumes. Of the three sets of Kangyur, two are <b>handwritten</b> and one is printed. The printed sets are in 101 volumes. One <b>handwritten</b> set has 131 volumes and the other 125 volumes; the letters of these 125 books are washed in gold. The religious text, Gyentongpa, has letters washed in gold in all its pages. At some stage, some of the sacred scriptures were lost and the reason was attributed to the monks of the Tsona monastery who used to visit Tawang during winter time. In the past, these monks had demanded that the gilded image of the Buddha be gifted to them. This was not accepted by the Lamas of the Tawang Monastery and as result the Tsona Lamas refused to part {{with some of the}} sacred texts and records of the Tawang Monastery which were with them. They again took away more books in 1951.|$|E
5|$|The {{play was}} not {{published}} in Verne's lifetime and was presumed lost until 1978, when a <b>handwritten</b> copy {{was discovered in}} the Archives of the Censorship Office of the Third Republic. The text was published in France by Jean-Jacques Pauvert in 1981. An English translation by Edward Baxter was commissioned by the North American Jules Verne Society and published in 2003 by Prometheus Books. The first production of the play after its rediscovery occurred in 2005, in a small-scale performance at the Histrio Theatre in Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main <b>handwritten</b> {{forms of the}} Deseret alphabet: a cursive version and a printed version. Over the {{lifetime}} of the alphabet, the cursive form fell out of favor among most users of the alphabet and by 1856 no more cursive documents exist. Its impact on the glyphs can however still be plainly seen in the loops of certain characters such as 𐑅, 𐑀 and 𐐼. The earliest surviving versions of the Deseret alphabet, from 1853 (one year before its January 1854 approval), have printed and cursive forms side-by-side, suggesting that a cursive form {{was part of the}} plan from the very beginning.|$|E
5|$|Two {{books were}} {{released}} {{related to the}} original series: Mr. Bean's Diary in 1992 and Mr. Bean's Pocket Diary in 1994. The two books have identical content and differ only in the format {{in which they are}} printed. The content of both is a template diary with <b>handwritten</b> content scrawled in by Mr. Bean. They provide some additional information on the setting: for example, they establish that Mr. Bean lives in Highbury and rents his flat from a landlady named Mrs. Wicket.|$|E
5|$|After the Russian Revolution, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's capital {{moved from}} Kharkiv to Kiev in 1934, {{and the city}} {{was in need of}} a {{suburban}} residence for government officials. Mezhyhirya was chosen as the site of the new government residence. The decision of the Politburo in April 1935 ordered the demolition of the whole complex. Before the scheduled demolition in 1936, the architecture and buildings of the monastic complex were photographed. During the demolition, an underground library was discovered, full of <b>handwritten</b> manuscripts. There are speculations that the discovered books belonged to the lost library of Yaroslav the Wise, or perhaps of a later period, during the times of the Zaporozhian Host. The only thing that remains now of the monastic complex is a water well.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{she wrote}} Je Me Souviens (I Remember), an {{intensely}} personal prose poem {{about their relationship}} which was presented as a single <b>handwritten</b> copy to Vivien {{in an attempt to}} win her back. They reconciled and traveled together to Lesbos, where they lived happily together for a short time and talked about starting a school of poetry for women like the one which Sappho, according to tradition, had founded on Lesbos some 2,500 years before. However, Vivien soon got a letter from her lover Baroness Hélène van Zuylen and went to Constantinople thinking she would break up with her in person. Vivien planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward but instead stayed with the Baroness and this time, the breakup was permanent.|$|E
