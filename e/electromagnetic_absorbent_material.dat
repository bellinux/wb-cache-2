40|$|We have {{synthesized}} nanoscale magnetic compasses {{with high}} yield. These ferromagnetic iron carbide nano-particles, which are encapsulated {{in a pair}} of parallel carbon needles, change their direction in response to an external magnetic field. Electron holography reveals magnetic fields confined to the vicinity of the bicone-shaped particles, which are composed of few ferromagnetic domains. Aligned magnetically and encapsulated in an acrylate polymer matrix, these nanocompasses exhibit anisotropic bulk magnetic permeability with an easy axis normal to the needle direction, that can be understood {{as a result of the}} anisotropic demagnetizing field of a nonspherical single-domain particle. This novel material with orthogonal magnetic and structural axes could be highly useful as magnetic components in <b>electromagnetic</b> wave <b>absorbent</b> <b>materials</b> and magnetorheological fluids.

The room with walls covered by the low <b>absorbent</b> <b>material</b> {{constituted}} the initial configuration for the study. To decrease a reverberation time, alterations of acoustic room properties were carried out by adding a high <b>absorbent</b> <b>material</b> on lateral room walls.

Numerical results have demonstrated that an introduction of high <b>absorbent</b> <b>material</b> on selected room walls may cause an intense dou-ble slope effect. It is characterized by rapid initial and slow late decays, thus the decay curve exhibits so-called a “sagging ” appearance.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{a finite}} element {{approach}} has been developed to study the acoustic behaviour of perforated dissipative mufflers with heterogeneous <b>absorbent</b> <b>material</b> {{and the presence of}} mean flow. The heterogeneous properties can appear, for example, during the manufacturing processes of the dissipative muffler or due to the flow of soot particles within the <b>absorbent</b> <b>material.</b> A uniform mean flow is considered within the central passage and a perforated duct separates this flow from the outer dissipative chamber. First, the finite element method is applied to the wave equation for a stationary non-homogeneous medium (outer chamber) and a moving homogeneous medium (central passage). The <b>absorbent</b> <b>material</b> is characterized as an equivalent fluid, by means of its complex density and speed of sound. To introduce the variations of these properties within the material, a coordinate-dependent function is proposed for the filling density. This yields a heterogeneous resistivity, which produces spatial modifications of the equivalent properties. The acoustic impedance of the perforated duct has been also modified to include the heterogeneous properties of the dissipative medium. Finally, the effect of the mean flow Mach number, filling density and porosity of the perforated duct on the acoustic attenuation of the muffler is studied...|$|R
