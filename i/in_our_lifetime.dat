Struggling with depression and cocaine addiction, Gaye had agreed to move to Ostend on the advice of longtime resident Freddy Cousaert. While in Ostend, Gaye began to curb his drug use and recover from his depression, partaking in Ostend's beaches. Gaye also began cutting ties with his longtime recording label, Motown, following the release of <b>In</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Lifetime,</b> an album the musician did not declare to be finished. He declared that he would never record with the label ever again after he accused the label of betraying his creativity.|$|E
