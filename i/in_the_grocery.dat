After stumbling upon the carnage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store, Scully telephones Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and describes the bizarre situation. Mulder tells Scully that the incident might {{be the result of}} witchcraft or sorcery. Scully, however, can find no physical evidence that might support his theory. Assisted by the local police, Scully reviews the store's surveillance footage and notices Melissa Turner leaving the scene, the only customer unaffected. Jack Bonsaint, the police chief, tells Scully that some townspeople believe Melissa to be a witch. Deputy Buddy Riggs informs Melissa that Bonsaint will be questioning her. Riggs promises to help Melissa, but she warns him to stay away.|$|E

25|$|Walker was {{not new to}} {{the world}} of business. Since his {{migration}} to Detroit he had been involved in several different projects. In his earlier days he worked as a grocery clerk from 1838 until 1845 for several different employers. Eventually, after being involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> business for several years, he took it upon himself to begin operating a grocery store of his own in 1846 which did not last. Following his work as a clerk, Walker was employed at the firm of Ingersoll and Kirby, a leather and leather goods business. Through this, he gained his first knowledge into the business world. By 1845, Walker saved enough money as a clerk to invest in a business, the firm of Walker and Parker, which specialized in tanning and leather sales. However, this partnership dissolved in 1846, and Walker returned to the grocery business. Eventually, the same tannery business that he invested in was burned down in 1848.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, a year {{of strong}} {{economic}} activity and robust competition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> market, prices in Houston's grocery stores were {{below the national average}} prices in grocery stores. Houston's grocery price index averaged at 85.6, below the national average of 88.4. This means that, for the 1982-1984 base period, Houstonians paid $88.40 for an amount of food that would cost $100 according to the national average. During the oil bust and the economic decline, Houston's prices stayed even with the national average. In 1983 Houston's grocery index increased from 96.8 to 99.4 and matched the national average of 99.1. As the city began to recover, the prices began to edge upward. When a recession in the U.S. began and while Houston's economic growth slowed and continued, the national price index fell below Houston's price index. As of 1992 prices in Houston's grocery stores were higher than the national average; Houston's index averaged to be 137.3, and the national average was 132.3.|$|E
25|$|Mehaffey {{was born}} in November 1889 in Lima, Ohio, to William R. and Mary Brooks (Stahl) Mehaffey. His {{grandfather}} was Robert Mehaffey, an Ulster Scot who emigrated from County Tyrone, Ireland (which {{at that time was}} part of the United Kingdom) in 1850 or 1851 at the age of 17. Settling in Lima, he established him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> and then banking business, rising to the position of Vice President of the First National Bank of Lima. He later organized the Merchants National Bank and Metropolitan Bank. He was elected to two terms in the Ohio Senate, and owned a large amount of stock in the Allen County Democrat newspaper. Mehaffey's father worked in the Allen County Democrat beginning in 1885, then purchased the paper and merged it with the Daily Times to form the Lima Times Democrat (a newspaper which still exists in 2013). Joseph had an older brother, Robert Chisholm (born July 22, 1884), and an older sister, Eleanor Cowles (born October 10, 1885 and died in 1887). He also had a younger brother, William Kenneth (born August 23, 1889, and died in 1896). Mehaffey's mother died in March 1899, and his father in November 1907 married Mary E. Mount of Chatham-Kent, Ontario, Canada.|$|E
40|$|The Diploma thesis,Selected {{aspects of}} the retail supplier-purchaser relations' defines British grocery retailing. It {{presents}} government bodies which regulate retail industry and important independent not-for-profit organizations which have a strong influence on the market situation. It introduces the reader into legislation which regulates supplier-purchaser relations, particularly the Supermarket Code of Practice and its revised version <b>the</b> <b>Groceries</b> Supply Code of Practice. The analytical part examines the British market at the macroeconomical level, outlines <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> retailing structure, describes the supply chain, customer behaviour, points out certain pricing and product policy trends and presents subjects which are bonded by the provisions set out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Groceries</b> Supply Code of Practice. The findings on local market competition and barriers which prevent the entry by a competitor are of a high significance as well. Despite the introduction of legal regulation the supplier-purchaser relations remain unequal and unfair. The thesis proposes a forecast of possible future <b>grocery</b> market development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom...|$|R

25|$|Nationwide, Walmart {{gained a}} {{dominant}} position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> industry, forcing {{much of the}} competition to downsize, though in A's core Northeast region, Walmart still had not become a major grocery competitor. In 2003, after declaring its largest loss, A closed Kohl's Food Stores and A's remaining stores in Vermont and New Hampshire, reducing it to just over 500 stores. Also in 2003, A spun off the Eight O'Clock Coffee division (its last manufacturing operation) to Gryphon Investors for $107 million. (In 2006, Gryphon sold Eight O'Clock Coffee to Tata Global Beverages for $220 million). In 2005, A sold its 237-store Canadian division (consisting of A, Dominion, and Food Basics units) to Montreal-based Metro Inc. for C$1.7 billion in cash plus shares of Metro. By 2009, the A name disappeared from these stores. In 2007, A closed its New Orleans division, limiting A's footprint to the Northeast. Also in 2007, A acquired Pathmark, a long-time Northeastern rival, for $1.4 billion. This allowed A to regain its position as the largest grocery retailer in the New York City area, and the second-largest in the Philadelphia area. However, the Federal Trade Commission declared {{that as a result}} of the acquisition, A would be a monopoly in parts of Long Island and Staten Island. As part of its settlement with the FTC, the corporation was forced to divest of some Waldbaum's and Pathmarks.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} factors {{within the field}} of {{agriculture}} that contribute to the large amount of CO2 emissions. The diversity of the sources ranges from the production of farming tools to the transport of harvested produce. Approximately 8% of the national carbon footprint is due to agricultural sources. Of that, 75% is of the carbon emissions released from the production of crop assisting chemicals. Factories producing insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers are a major culprit of the greenhouse gas. Productivity on the farm itself and the use of machinery is another source of the carbon emission. Almost all the industrial machines used in modern farming are powered by fossil fuels. These instruments are burning fossil fuels {{from the beginning of the}} process to the end. Tractors are the root of this source. The tractor is going to burn fuel and release CO2 just to run. The amount of emissions from the machinery increase with the attachment of different units and need for more power. During the soil preparation stage tillers and plows will be used to disrupt the soil. During growth watering pumps and sprayers are used to keep the crops hydrated. And when the crops are ready for picking a forage or combine harvester is used. These types of machinery all require additional energy which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the basic tractors. The final major contribution to CO2 emissions in agriculture is in the final transport of produce. Local farming suffered a decline over the past century due to large amounts of farm subsidies. The majority of crops are shipped hundreds of miles to various processing plants before ending up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> store. These shipments are made using fossil fuel burning modes of transportation. Inevitably these transport adds to carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E
