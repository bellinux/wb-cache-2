Granules were formed <b>from</b> the <b>dusts</b> mixture consisting in 50 mass% of dusts obtained after the reclamation of the furane sands and in 50 mass % of <b>dusts</b> <b>from</b> sands with bentonite. <b>Dusts</b> <b>from</b> the bentonite sands with water were used as a binder allowing the granulation of after reclamation <b>dusts</b> <b>from</b> the furane sands. The following parameters of the ready final product were determined: moisture content (W), shatter test of granules (Wz) performeddirectly after the granulation process and after 1, 3, 5, 10 days and nights of seasoning, water-resistance of granules after 24 hours of being immersed in water, surface porosity ep and volumetric porosity ev. In addition the shatter test and water-resistance of granulate dried at a temperature of 105 oC were determined. Investigations were performed at the bowl angle of inclination 45 o, for three rotational speeds of the bowl being: 10, 15, 20 rpm. For the speed of 10 rpm the granulation tests of dusts mixture after the preliminary mixing in the roller mixer and with the addition ofwater-glass {{in the amount of}} 2 % in relation to the amount of dust were carried out.

40|$|The {{function}} of the peripheral plasma in the Large Helical Device (LHD) on transport of dusts is investigated using a dust transport simulation code (DUSTT) in a non-axisymmetric geometry. The simulation shows that the transport of the dusts {{is dominated by the}} plasma flow (mainly by ion drag force) formed in the peripheral plasma. The trajectories of dusts are investigated in two probable situations: release of spherical iron <b>dusts</b> <b>from</b> the inboard side of the torus, and drop of spherical carbon <b>dusts</b> <b>from</b> a divertor plate installed near an edge of an upper port. The trajectories in these two situations are calculated in various sized <b>dust</b> cases. <b>From</b> a viewpoint of protection of the main plasma <b>from</b> <b>dust</b> penetration, it proves that there are two functions in the LHD peripheral plasma. One is sweeping of dusts by the effect of the plasma flow in the divertor legs, and another one is evaporation/sublimation of dusts by heat load onto the dusts in the ergodic layer...|$|R

5|$|The peak {{brightness}} of the μ ring lies almost exactly on the orbit of the small Uranian moon Mab, which is probably {{the source of the}} ring’s particles. The ν ring is positioned between Portia and Rosalind and does not contain any moons inside it. A reanalysis of the Voyager 2 images of forward-scattered light clearly reveals the μ and ν rings. In this geometry the rings are much brighter, which indicates that they contain much micrometer-sized dust. The outer rings of Uranus may be similar to the G and E rings of Saturn as E ring is extremely broad and receives <b>dust</b> <b>from</b> Enceladus.|$|E

5|$|There {{are local}} names for winds {{associated}} with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust {{during the winter}} into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings <b>dust</b> <b>from</b> north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin.

5|$|Winds can shape landforms, via {{a variety}} of aeolian {{processes}} such as the formation of fertile soils, such as loess, and by erosion. <b>Dust</b> <b>from</b> large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names {{in various parts of}} the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.|$|E

5|$|During mid-summer (July in the {{northern}} hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When <b>dust</b> <b>from</b> the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads {{to an increase in}} red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.|$|E
5|$|In the past, some {{visitors}} {{would write}} {{their names on}} the Wall, or based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the crevices. These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised {{the sanctity of the}} Wall. Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long responsa appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper Havatzelet in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration. More recently the Yalkut Yosef rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or <b>dust</b> <b>from</b> the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness. Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a halachic point of view. Blasphemous graffiti once sprayed by a tourist was left visible for months until it began to peel away.|$|E
5|$|Io plays a {{significant}} role in shaping Jupiter's magnetic field, acting as an electric generator that can develop 400,000 volts across itself and create an electric current of 3 million amperes, releasing ions that give Jupiter a magnetic field inflated to more than twice the size it would otherwise have. The magnetosphere of Jupiter sweeps up gases and <b>dust</b> <b>from</b> Io's thin atmosphere at a rate of 1tonne per second. This material is mostly composed of ionized and atomic sulfur, oxygen and chlorine; atomic sodium and potassium; molecular sulfur dioxide and sulfur; and sodium chloride dust. These materials originate from Io's volcanic activity, but the material that escapes to Jupiter's magnetic field and into interplanetary space comes directly from Io's atmosphere. These materials, depending on their ionized state and composition, end up in various neutral (non-ionized) clouds and radiation belts in Jupiter's magnetosphere and, in some cases, are eventually ejected from the Jovian system.|$|E
