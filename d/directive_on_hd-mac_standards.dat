5000|$|E! 95 was a 730 million euros HDTV project, {{which created}} the <b>HD-MAC</b> <b>standard</b> for high {{definition}} television.|$|R
50|$|The <b>HD-MAC</b> <b>standard</b> was {{abandoned}} in 1993, {{and since then}} all EU and EBU efforts {{have focused on the}} DVB system (Digital Video Broadcasting), which allows both SDTV and HDTV.|$|R
50|$|The EBU {{development}} and deployment of B-MAC, D-MAC and much later <b>on</b> <b>HD-MAC</b> were {{made possible by}} Hi-Vision's technical success. In many ways MAC transmission systems are better than MUSE because of the total separation of colour from brightness in the time domain within the MAC signal structure.|$|R
5000|$|Henri Georges de France (7 September 1911 Paris [...] - [...] 29 April 1986 Paris) was a {{pioneering}} French television inventor. His inventions include the 819 line French standard and the SECAM color system. He was also apparently behind the <b>HD-MAC</b> high-definition <b>standard.</b>|$|R
50|$|Work <b>on</b> <b>HD-MAC</b> {{specification}} started officially in May 1986. The {{purpose was}} to react against a Japanese proposal, supported by the US, which aimed to establish the NHK-designed system as a world standard. Besides preservation of the European electronic industry, {{there was also a}} need to produce a standard that would be compliant with the 50 Hz field frequency systems (used by a large majority of countries in the world). Truth be said, the precisely 60 Hz of the Japanese proposal was also worrying the US, as their NTSC M-based standard definition infrastructure used a practical frequency of 59.94 Hz. This apparently minor difference had the potential for a lot of trouble.|$|R
