25|$|Labour MP Caroline Flint {{has said}} that {{independence}} would mean higher energy bills in Scotland, as its customers would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> to support renewable energy in Scotland, which represents {{one third of the}} UK total. Euan Phimister {{has said that}} bills are likely to increase across the whole of Great Britain because renewable schemes and new nuclear power stations in England are both receiving higher subsidies than the power plants which will shortly close due to environmental regulations. He also said that there is a distinction between existing and proposed renewable schemes in that the existing schemes have already been paid for, whereas any new construction requires the promise of subsidy from the consumer. Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey stated Scottish generators would no longer be eligible for UK subsidies, which would increase energy bills for consumers.|$|E
25|$|However, {{debate over}} how much the program helped to develop {{affordable}} housing in the city continued. Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, along with other advocacy groups, worried {{that the loss of}} the tax break would make affordable housing too expensive to build in the city, and that the city would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> to build such units. From when Mayor de Blasio took office in January 2014 to the expiration of the program in January 2016, developers received financing for 13,929 affordable units, of which 5,006 utilized the 421-a abatement program. In response to this issue, Governor Cuomo brought both union leaders and real estate executives together to create a deal on paying union-level wages on 421-a projects. At the conclusion of negotiations, unions and real estate developers reached an agreement to pay workers $60/hr on covered projects in Manhattan and $45/hr on covered projects within a mile of the East River waterfront in Queens and Brooklyn. As such, the bill was submitted to the state legislature for approval. The program was officially revived with the passage of New York State's $153.1 billion budget in April 2017.|$|E

500|$|President Seth S. Haines of Waynesville broke {{ground in}} Eden Park on September 1, 1876, {{although}} most early {{work was done}} outside Cincinnati. The company continued to be plagued by lack of funds, and, despite completion of the grade between Norwood and Waynesville within a year, work soon slowed and eventually stopped in late 1878. Contractor John B. Benedict brought a suit in December for breach of contract, alleging {{that he was not}} properly paid. During the trial, two embarrassing facts came to light: Haines and Benedict had signed a [...] "secret contract" [...] giving Haines a portion of the bonds paid to Benedict, and the price of the line south of Norwood had been artificially inflated so that the connecting Cincinnati and Eastern Railway (C, later a N line) would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> for trackage rights into Cincinnati. However, it was nonpayment of interest on bonds that forced the Miami Valley into receivership in January and foreclosure in March 1880. Another decade had passed and Lebanon still lacked a railroad.|$|E
