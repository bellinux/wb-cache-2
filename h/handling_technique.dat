It addresses the premature convergence problem {{as well as the}} diversity problem associated with Genetic Algorithm. Thus it restricts their individuals to be trapped in the local optima. This paper proposes Dual Population Genetic Algorithm for solving Constrained Optimization Problems. A novel method based on maximum constrains satisfaction is applied as constrains <b>handling</b> <b>technique</b> and Dual Population Genetic Algorithm is used as meta-heuristic. This method is verified against 9 problems from Problem Definitions and Evaluation Criteria for the Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2006 Special Session on Constrained Real-Parameter Optimization problem set.

A real coded genetic algorithm with a robust constraint <b>handling</b> <b>technique</b> is used as the optimization method. The objective {{is to develop a}} formulation of the optimization problem for the late bearing design of a complex rotor-bearing system. Furthermore, the usefulness of the search method is evaluated on a difficult problem. The effects considered are power loss and limiting temperatures in the bearings as well as the dynamics at the system level, i. e., stability and unbalance responses. The design variables are the bearing widths and radial clearances. A nominal design is the basis for comparison of the optimal solution found. An initial numerical experiment shows that finding a solution that fulfills all the constraints for the system design is likely impossible. Still, the optimization shows the possibility of finding a solution resulting in a reduced power loss while not violating any of the constraints more than the nominal design. Furthermore, the result also shows that the used search method and constraint <b>handling</b> <b>technique</b> works on this difficult problem. Validerad; 2006; 20070921 (ysko...|$|E

Given an optimized object detection template, the feasibility and effectiveness of the methodology is considered for vehicle counting applications, implementing both a filtering operation of false detection, based on the speed variability in each segment of traffic state, and an occlusion <b>handling</b> <b>technique</b> which considers the unusual affine transformation of tracking subspace, {{as well as its}} highly fluctuating averaged acceleration data. The result presents the overall performance considering the trade-off relationship between true detection rate and false detection rate. The filtering operation achieved significant success in removing the majority of non-vehicle elements that do not move like a vehicle. The occlusion <b>handling</b> <b>technique</b> employed also improved the systems performance, contributing counts that would otherwise be lost. For all video samples tested, the proposed framework obtained high correct count (> 93 % correct counting rate) while simultaneously minimizing the false count rate.
