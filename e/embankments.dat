With the construction of the banks of the adjacent saltfields maintenance of the <b>embankments</b> ceased and the mangroves began to reclaim them.

In view of the deficiencies, an improved technique, fixed-geosynthetic-reinforced and pile-supported <b>embankment</b> (called FGT <b>embankment),</b> is developed. To investigate the performance of the FGT <b>embankment,</b> the comparison analyses and parametric studies are conducted by Finite Element Method (FEM). The influencing factors investigated include elastic modulus of soil, tensile stiffness of geosynthetics, pile length, pile spacing, and pile elastic modulus. In addition, the cost evaluation for the FGT <b>embankment</b> and CT <b>embankment</b> is also made.

Work on high-, mid- and low-level systems for the new Northern and Southern Outfall Sewers started {{at the beginning of}} 1859 and lasted until 1875. To aid the drainage, pumping stations were placed to lift the sewage from lower levels into higher pipes. Two of the more ornate stations, Abbey Mills in Stratford and Crossness on the Erith Marshes, are listed for protection by English Heritage.

The Muar trial <b>embankment</b> was simulated in two- and three-dimension (2 -D and 3 -D) utilizing finite element programs PLAXIS 2 -D AND PLAXIS 3 -D FOUNDATION, using staged-construction procedure. Sensitivity analysis was performed by varying the thickness of weathered crust layer beneath the <b>embankment</b> fill, i. e., three models of <b>embankment</b> with no surface crust, 1 m surface crust and 2 m surface crust layer. Predictions were made for the vertical and the horizontal displacements of the <b>embankment.</b> Factor of safety for each meter increase in the <b>embankment</b> height was defined until the failure is reached. It is concluded that the bearing capacity of the ground and the deformation behavior of the <b>embankment</b> were sensitive to the thickness of the weathered crust layer. The surface crust layer has a positive effect on the stability of the <b>embankment</b> and consequently reduces the settlement and increases the failure height of the <b>embankment</b> fill up to 37 %...|$|R
