Richard Brody of The New Yorker also gave the film a negative review, writing that, {{instead of being a}} drama, the film is an unoriginal work of criticism which [...] "points to what everyone ought already to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> in the first place: not least, that it's no surprise to learn that a filmmaker whose art is devoted to pain, fear, control, and sexual obsession also experienced and inflicted them in life". On the day of its UK premiere, James Rampton of The Independent wrote that The Girl was [...] "no mere black-and-white hatchet job on Hitch. It does not seek to portray him as an unambiguous monster; rather, it highlights the profound psychological damage that plagued the director throughout his life". The Guardians Deborah Orr was generally positive about the film: [...] "here was only one thing wrong with The Girl. There was no Hitchcock in the director's chair to make it the utterly compelling psychological drama that it could have been." ...|$|E

So compared to what people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> here the pictures are quite benign. There's nothing unexpected.
