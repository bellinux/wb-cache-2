5|$|Morality is {{measured}} by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game. For example, the game features some missions to gain the loyalty of the squad. What the player does during one of these missions will determine whether they gain the loyalty of a squad member, which in turn will unlock a special power and also help in the final battle. Endings range from the <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> surviving to the <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> being killed, Shepard included, and everything in between. Upon completing the game, a New Game Plus option is unlocked, allowing players to replay the game using the same character with which they finished it.|$|E

5|$|After McDonnell {{had made}} 103 out of 158, Murdoch and Scott {{completed}} the first double-century partnership in Test cricket. England, as the score mounted, used 11 bowlers: {{the first time}} in Test cricket that an <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> including the wicketkeeper was called upon to bowl. On this occasion, the wicketkeeper Lyttelton was the most successful bowler, taking 4/19. Grace, keeping wicket to Lyttelton, took a catch to dismiss Midwinter.|$|E

5|$|As {{well as the}} {{disputes}} over the refereeing, the goal judges on several occasions did not turn on the red light indicating a goal after a Canadian score. After Henderson's goal in game seven, Sinden sent the <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> off the bench to ensure the goal was counted. A similar incident during game eight led to the melee that Eagleson was involved in.|$|E
5|$|Cheers: If {{a school}} sports team is victorious the <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> will, on return to school, stand on Central Hall Table (Central Hall being the school's focal point) {{and the captain}} will lead three cheers for the school.

5|$|A superstition that is {{prevalent}} among many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either touch or hoist the Wales (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell (Western Conference champion) Trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus {{it should be the}} only trophy that they should be hoisting. Instead of touching the conference trophy, the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, the <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> poses as well. However, there have been other teams who have ignored the superstition and hoisted the conference trophies, sometimes going on to win the Cup anyway.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} times when players and even <b>entire</b> <b>teams</b> carry on {{personal}} rivalries that {{have little to}} do with individual games; fights frequently occur for no other reason.

5|$|Activision {{provided}} {{a budget of}} US$1.8 million; the amount was intentionally kept low to make the project manageable for Nihilistic and reduce the risk to Activision, which was relatively inexperienced with RPGs at the time. Nihilistic's management was committed to the <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> working in a one-room environment with no walls, doors, or offices, believing this would force the individual groups to communicate and allow each department to respond to queries immediately, saving hours or days of development time. Redemptions story was developed with input from Wolf; it was co-written by Daniel Greenberg, {{a writer for the}} source pen-and-paper RPG.|$|E

5|$|Between every down, {{the player}} selects a formation, play and, on defense, {{coverage}} shell from a menu. The game contains fifty-five offensive plays and seventy-one defensive plays, such as screen and play-action passes, blitzes and man-to-man defense. During a down, the player may control one team member {{at a time}} or allow the <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> to execute a play automatically. On offense, depending on the play, the player controls the quarterback, running back or kicker. After a pass, control automatically changes to the ball receiver. On defense, the player may at any time switch control between any members of the team. Instant replay is available to review plays.|$|E

5|$|Göth {{believed}} if {{one member}} of a work team escaped or committed some infraction, the <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> must be punished. On one occasion he ordered the shooting of every second member of a work detail {{because one of the}} party had escaped. On another occasion he personally shot every fifth member of a crew because one had not returned to the camp. The main murder site at Płaszów was Hujowa Górka ("Prick Hill"), a large hill that was used for mass killings and murders. Pemper testified that 8,000 to 12,000 people were murdered at Płaszów.|$|E
5|$|On 31 March 2014, Heston Blumenthal {{announced}} he would be closing the restaurant for renovations for 6 months and temporarily relocating it with its <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> to Crown Towers, Melbourne, Australia. The restaurant will be called The Fat Duck for 6 months before being renamed Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. This will be the second restaurant with that name and will be Blumenthal's first restaurant outside of Britain, and his sixth in total. This temporary closure of the Bray location caused the restaurant to become ineligible for assessment for the 2016 Michelin Guide, thus losing its 3-starred status which it regained the following year.|$|E
5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the <b>entire</b> <b>team.</b> Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E

Second place team East Germany also {{did not have a}} single gold medal winner (four silver, four bronze).|$|E
5|$|While {{the team}} was a success, Willis and Motley contended with their share of racism. They were taunted, stepped on and insulted on the field. Off-the-field {{incidents}} also occurred. In their first season in 1946, Willis and Motley did not travel to {{a game against the}} Miami Seahawks after they received threatening letters and Miami officials said they would invoke a Florida law that forbade black players from competing against whites. Another time, a hotel where {{the team was}} staying asked Willis and Motley to leave. Brown threatened to move the <b>entire</b> <b>team,</b> and the hotel's management backed down. Willis and Motley were forced to stay in a separate hotel for a 1949 AAFC all-star game in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking a}} year off from baseball, Zito signed a minor league {{contract}} {{to return to the}} Athletics on February 16, 2015. In spring training, Zito competed for a role on the Athletics' 25-man roster, possibly as a long reliever. On April 4, 2015, Zito accepted an assignment to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Zito's Nashville teammates lauded him for embracing the Triple-A lifestyle and for his commitment to the team: charting pitches between starts, coaching first base, and even buying dinner for the <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> on his birthday. Zito spent the entire season with Nashville, including about a month on the disabled list with left shoulder tendinitis. He was activated on the next-to-last day of the season on which he pitched one scoreless inning of relief. In a total of 24appearances (22 starts), he accrued an 8–7 record with a 3.46 ERA and 91 strikeouts.|$|E

50|$|The duo, {{particularly}} Slaven's, commentary often features sensationalist over-reactions to {{the game}} at hand, such as calling for <b>entire</b> <b>teams</b> of players to be sacked after losses, or even questioning whether certain teams will ever win another match in the future.

5|$|For the 1924–25 season, the Canadiens {{celebrated their}} world {{champion}} status {{with a special}} jersey design. The team moved their CH logo to their sleeves and played with a large world globe logo crest on their jersey fronts. Montreal {{finished third in the}} league standings and defeated Toronto in the semi-final. The players on the first place Hamilton Tigers refused to participate in a playoff series unless they were paid an additional $200 each. When they failed to relent on their demands, NHL president Frank Calder suspended the <b>entire</b> <b>team,</b> and declared the Canadiens to be the league champions. The Habs thus traveled to the Pacific Coast to play the WCHL's Victoria Cougars in the 1925 Stanley Cup Final. The Cougars won the best-of-five series 3–1; {{it was the last time}} a non-NHL team won the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Much {{like the}} {{previous}} year, {{one-third of the}} reigning Mexican National Trios Champions was unable to further help defend the title. This year, CMLL resolved the situation differently, but still managed to organize in a tournament. The champions, Mascara Dorada, Stuka Jr., and Metro, successfully defended their championship on November 15, 2010, in Arena Puebla. Dorada suffered an ankle injury {{during the course of}} the match. Citing both the injury (which would keep him out a month) and, more so, the demands of his other three championships, Mascara Dorada vacated his share of the titles three days later. CMLL broke with the precedent of forcing the <b>entire</b> <b>team</b> to vacate the titles and instead declared a web poll would determine a replacement for Mascara Dorada.

5|$|The IIHF {{follows the}} World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) {{regulations}} on performance-enhancing drugs. The IIHF maintains a Registered Testing Pool, {{a list of}} top players who are subjected to random in-competition and out-of-competition drug tests. According to the WADA, a positive in-competition test results in disqualification of the player and a suspension that varies {{based on the number}} of offences. When a player tests positive, the rest of their team is subjected to testing; another positive test can result in a disqualification of the <b>entire</b> <b>team.</b> In 2001, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) pushed for American NHL players who were potential Olympians to be subject to random drug tests. The USOC requires all Olympic-bound athletes to be randomly tested by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, but had exempted NHL players in 1998. The NHL preferred a more uniform method, in which all players would undergo the same number of tests from the WADA. An agreement was reached that the WADA would start testing players after the NHL playoffs were finished.|$|E

40|$|Monitoring {{teams of}} mobile nodes is {{becoming}} crucial {{in a growing}} number of activities. Where {{it is not possible to}} use fixed references or external measurements, one of the possible solutions involves deriving relative positions from local communication. Well-known techniques such as trilateration and multilateration exist to locate a single node although such methods are not designed to locate <b>entire</b> <b>teams.</b> The technique of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), however, allow us to find the relative coordinates of <b>entire</b> <b>teams</b> starting from the knowledge of the inter-node distances. However, like every relative-localization technique, it suffers from geometrical ambiguities including rotation, translation, and flip. In this work, we address such ambiguities by exploiting the node velocities to correlate the relative maps at two consecutive instants. In particular, we introduce a new version of MDS, called enhanced Multidimensional Scaling (eMDS), which is able to handle these types of ambiguities. The effectiveness of our localization technique is then validated by a set of simulation experiments and our results are compared against existing approaches...|$|R
