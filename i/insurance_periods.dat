30|$|It {{takes longer}} to process cross-national pension {{applications}} than national pensions. Frequent delays occur during {{the confirmation of}} the extent of <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> in Morocco and Turkey, as local institutions must generate individual insurance data from documents provided in paper form by regional offices. The list of <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> is collected only at the time of a pension application, and account clearances with yearly entitlement announcements do not exist. Thus, for example, the pension application for the Austrian or German part is processed very quickly as the domestic insurance file is essentially ready at the time of application, but in Turkey, the process may take many months (for details see Holzmann et al. 2016 a, 2016 b). Similar experiences are also reported for the west corridors.|$|E

As a result, applications to the east corridor countries once received by postal communication can be responded in normal cases, by Austria and Germany, with a preliminary approval within days and a definite approval within weeks. If additional written records are required (as may be the case in the western corridor countries), the weeks will become months. If <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> were acquired in the sending countries before or after returning home, then their collection and verification can be time-consuming, particularly if the date of birth or name is unclear. If benefit information from the sending country is required to establish totalization or the level of top-ups when residing in the host country, the delay can be substantial as is the loss of benefit disbursement or delayed payment of top-ups.|$|E

Using the case of an emerging economy, Bolivia, which introduced a deposit insurance system during the sample period, we compare the risk-taking behavior of banks before and after the introduction of this system. We find that in the post-deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>period,</b> banks are more likely to initiate riskier loans (i. e., loans with worse internal ratings at origination). These loans carry higher interest rates and are associated with worse ex-post performance (i. e., they have higher default and delinquency rates). Banks do not seem to compensate for the extra risk by increasing collateral requirements or decreasing loan maturities. We also find evidence that the increase in risk-taking is due to the decrease in market discipline from large depositors. Finally, differences between large (too-big-to-fail) and small banks diminished in the post-deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>period.</b> ...|$|R

30|$|The {{timeliness}} of {{the benefit}} calculation depends on how records of <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> are prepared within individual schemes and on the presence or degree of electronic exchange between schemes. Timely preparation and electronic exchange exist in Austria and Germany, are absent in Belgium and France, and are also lacking in Turkey and Morocco. In the latter two countries, information is only put on paper when an application arrives and the exchange between the different funds also takes place in paper form. This substantially lengthens the application process. Turkey plans to apply an electronic format as of 2017. No plans for electronic exchange exist in Morocco. However, since 2013, Caisse Nationale de Securite Sociale (CNSS) has developed electronic forms, for instance, for birth and death certificates. Thus, electronic formats have been partially implemented in Morocco (CNSS) but not to facilitate portability.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of a flexible index design for weather index-based insurances using farm-level panel data on wheat production from Kazakhstan. The proposed flexible design is a generic framework that uses Growing Degree Days to determine annual variable start and end dates for the insured period. This approach reflects the progress of phenological plant growth phases more accurately than fixed periods and hence is expected to reduce the basis risk of the index insurance. In addition, we develop an economic framework that focuses on the role of downside risks and apply Quantile Regression to tailor optimal insurance specifications. This framework is then used to compare the downside risks {{associated with the use of}} flexible and fixed <b>insurance</b> <b>periods.</b> The results show that the introduction of flexibility in the index design leads to a reduction in farmers’ downside risk exposure and to a more efficient contract design...|$|E

The different designs of national social security schemes imply administrative hurdles and incompatibilities. The latter may also discourage labour movements between EU - countries since migration could bring about a reduction or a loss of social security rights acquired {{on the basis of}} past employment and past contributions. The access to new benefits may be hampered as long as some national social security insurance programs demand a minimum coverage period as a prerequisite for benefit claims and disregard preceding <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> in other countries.

If the claimant is below 30 years, the “passive” period is limited to 3 months; for older job seekers it is 9 months. Existing evidence indicates that many job seekers find work as they approach the end of the “passive” period. 4 Geerdsen and Holm (2007), for example, who take advantage of legislative changes in the lengths of the passive and active periods to identify their causal effects, show that the threat effect of activation is considerable. According to their estimates, a 50 percentage point increase in the risk of program enrolment results in an approximately 50 percent increase in the hazard out of unemployment.

It is shown that accumulation of funds in accumulative pension system (APS) requires complex calculations. A model for accumulation of funds in the accumulative pension insurance system used in this paper makes it possible to determine a set of interrelated parameters – insurance premium rates, reasonable <b>insurance</b> <b>periods,</b> the desired rates of profitability, the required amount of savings, investment potential of accumulative pension system, etc. The amount of funds in accumulative pension insurance system depends not only on the basis of insurance (number of payers of insurance premiums), the amount of contributions (rate and object) and (primarily) on the term of beginning of payments of insurance premiums, the coefficient of profitability of invested funds and guarantees of their safety at all stages of functioning of the accumulative system. The analysis has shown that it is necessary: to cover all people employed in the economy with accumulative pension insurance; a rate of contributions should be determined not only by wages, but also by income; prior to the introduction of accumulative pension system – to create the necessary infrastructure, to develop a legal framework, to organize the management of accumulative funds, to solve the issues related to the protection of funds from the risks of losses.

After dealing with the relevant conceptual framework, the report commences with a section highlighting the current diversity of social security systems in SADC countries and the problems this diversity creates for the mobility of people in SADC and their social security status. Restrictions contained in the legal system are in particular emphasized. The next section gives a high-level overview of those developments, initiatives and measures at a national, regional and international level which enhance the social security status of non-citizens in SADC. Finally, based on this descriptive and analytical section, the report proceeds with an analysis of how the problems experienced by non-citizens in SADC in social security terms, might be solved, where the shortcomings of the current initiatives are, and how to overcome these shortcomings. In this regard this final part also considers the potential to introduce cross-border social security arrangements, with particular reference to the maintenance of acquired social security rights, the aggregation of <b>insurance</b> <b>periods,</b> and the portability of social security benefits.

40|$|The Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the {{essential}} alterations {{in the field of}} the retirement pension insurance which occurred in the framework of the first stage of the pension reform since 1 January 2010 and which concerns conditions regulating pension claims and decides on the amount of pensions. The main purpose of the alterations is to contribute to the long-term financial sustainability of the Czech pension system. The theoretical part describes the basic principals of the retirement pension insurance, the financing of the pension insurance system, conditions of the pension claim to the particular types of pensions and the most important legal regulation alterations of the retirement pension insurance effective since 1 January 2010 in comparison to the legal regulation effective till 31 December 2009. The aim of my work was to find out the main problems occurring in the process of practical application of the parametric changes in the retirement pension insurance effective since 1 January 2010 and to find out possible impact of the changes on citizens. For the practical part of my work I chose the qualitative research, the questioning method and the technique of the semi-controlled dialogue. In total there were interviewed ten employees working at the pension departments of the regional social security authorities. The research shows that the main problems in the practical application of the retirement pension insurance arise in particular from the complicated legal regulation which is difficult to understand. Insufficient knowledge of the legal regulation reduces clients possibility to make the right decision on their pension claims. Parametric changes in the sphere of old-age pensions and alternative <b>insurance</b> <b>periods</b> will manifest gradually and will affect pension claims which will occur in the future. Gradual prolongation of the retirement age may result in the growth of disability and the increase of unemployment in case of the older citizens.
