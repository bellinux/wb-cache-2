5|$|It was at {{this time}} that Giáp began his countermoves. He had {{expected}} an attack, but could not foresee when or where it would occur. Giáp realized that, <b>if</b> <b>pressed,</b> the French would abandon Lai Châu Province and fight a pitched battle at Điện Biên Phủ. On 24 November, Giáp ordered the 148th Infantry Regiment and the 316th Division to attack Lai Chau, while the 308th, 312th, and 351st divisions assault Điện Biên Phủ from Việt Bắc.|$|E
25|$|Gödel's Platonism postulates {{a special}} kind of {{mathematical}} intuition that lets us perceive mathematical objects directly. (This view bears resemblances to many things Husserl said about mathematics, and supports Kant's idea that mathematics is synthetic a priori.) Davis and Hersh have suggested in their book The Mathematical Experience that most mathematicians act as though they are Platonists, even though, <b>if</b> <b>pressed</b> to defend the position carefully, they may retreat to formalism (see below).|$|E
25|$|Neame {{was ordered}} to {{conserve}} the tanks units, retire as far as Benghazi <b>if</b> <b>pressed,</b> to abandon it if necessary and hold the high ground nearby {{for as long as}} possible, with no prospect of reinforcement before May. Neame was to fight a delaying action up the Via Balbia towards Benghazi and then the defiles near Er Regima and Barce; the tanks would move to Antelat to operate against the flank and rear of an attacker moving up the road or across the desert to Tobruk, falling back on a flank if necessary. On 20 March, the 2nd Armoured Division took over from the Australians, who moved back to Tocra, near Er Regima. The force was to use depots at Msus, Tecnis, Martuba, Mechili and Tmimi, El Magrun and Bengahzi as a substitute for lorry-borne supply. The 3rd Indian Motor Brigade (Brigadier E. W. D. Vaughan) arrived in late March, with lorries but no tanks, artillery, anti-tank guns and only half its wireless sets; the brigade was based at Martuba, ready to use its vehicles to move towards Derna, Barce or Mechili.|$|E

25|$|There were no easily defended {{positions}} between El Agheila and Benghazi, {{the terrain}} being open and good tank country. Neame {{was ordered to}} conserve the tank units as far as possible, yet inflict losses on the Axis forces if they attacked, fight a delaying action as far as Benghazi <b>if</b> <b>pressed</b> and abandon the port if necessary. There was no prospect of reinforcement before May so the high ground of the escarpment nearby and the defiles to the north near Er Regima and Barce in the Jebel Akhdar, were {{to be held for}} as long as possible. The 2nd Armoured Division would move inland south of the Jebel to Antelat and operate against the flank and rear of the Axis forces, when they moved up the Via Balbia or cut across the desert towards Mechili and Tobruk. The tanks would have to use depots at Msus, Tecnis, Martuba, Mechili, Timimi, El Magrun and Benghazi as a substitute for lorry-borne supply. The 3rd Indian Motor Brigade (Brigadier E. W. D. Vaughan) arrived at Martuba in late March, with all its transport but no tanks, artillery, anti-tank guns and only half its wireless sets, to be ready to move towards Derna, Barce or Mechili if the Axis attacked.|$|E
25|$|A {{limitation}} of food sources {{in early spring}} and wild berry and nut crop failures during summer months may be contributing factors to black bears regularly feeding from commercial human-based food sources. Crops are frequently eaten by these bears, especially during autumn hyperphagia when natural foods are scarce. Favored crops may include apples, oats and corns. Black bears can do extensive damage {{in some areas of}} the northwestern United States by stripping the bark from trees and feeding on the cambium. Livestock depredations by black bears occur mostly in spring. Though black bears have the capacity to (and occasionally do) hunt adult cattle and horses, they seem to prefer smaller, more easily overwhelmed prey such as sheep, goats, calves, and pigs. They normally kill by biting the neck and shoulders, though they may break the neck or back of prey with blows from the paws. Evidence of a bear attack includes claw marks and is frequently found on the neck, back, and shoulders of larger animals. Surplus killing of sheep and goats are common. Bears have been known to frighten livestock herds over cliffs, causing injuries and death to many animals; {{whether or not this is}} intentional is not known. Occasionally, pets, especially dogs, which are most prone to harass a bear, are killed by black bears. It is not recommended to use unleashed dogs as a deterrent from bear attacks. Although large, aggressive dogs sometimes cause a bear to run, <b>if</b> <b>pressed,</b> angry bears frequently turn the tables and end up chasing the dog in return. A bear in pursuit of a pet dog has the potential to threaten both canid and human lives.|$|E

2500|$|The recent {{fall of the}} French {{occupied}} fortress city of Badajoz, on 6 April 1812, {{allowed the}} Anglo-Portuguese forces under Wellington to take the strategic offensive. [...] Prior to moving {{the bulk of his}} forces north where he would launch his Salamanca campaign Wellington entrusted a considerable proportion of his available cavalry to a force under General Sir Rowland Hill who was ordered to drive the retreating French army of Marshal Soult, who had failed in his attempt to relieve Badajoz, back into Andalusia to the south.

2500|$|Like all Asgardians, Thor is {{incredibly}} long-lived and relies upon periodic {{consumption of the}} Golden Apples of Idunn to sustain his extended lifespan, which to date has lasted many millennia. Being the son of Odin and the elder goddess Gaea, Thor is physically the strongest of the Asgardians. Thor is capable of incredible feats of strength, such as pushing over the Leaning Tower of Pisa with his little finger, ripping apart the Golden Gate Bridge, lifting the almost Earth-sized Midgard Serpent, and by combining his power with that of Beta Ray Bill, destroying Surtur's solar system-sized dimensional portal. <b>If</b> <b>pressed</b> in battle, Thor is capable of entering into a state known as the [...] "Warrior's Madness" [...] ("berserkergang" [...] in Norwegian and Danish alike), which will temporarily increase his strength and stamina tenfold, although in this state he attacks friend and foe alike.|$|E

2500|$|The British Government {{accepted}} {{the need to}} maintain a presence in Salonika to keep the French happy, but Robertson, who often communicated by secret letters and [...] "R" [...] telegrams to generals in the field, privately told Milne that he did not favour offensive operations. Milne broadly agreed with Robertson that any attempt to attack across the mountains to cut the Nis-Sofia-Constantinople railway was logistically impractical, although he did stress that his forces must either advance or retreat from the malaria-infested Struma Valley and that the Bulgarians might be beaten <b>if</b> <b>pressed</b> hard. On 23 July he was told to “engag(e) the maximum of Bulgar forces” whilst the Romanians mobilised and attacked, followed by secret messages from Robertson that he should “guard against being committed for any serious action” until it was certain that Romania was coming in. With Bulgaria seeming close to collapse in October and November 1916, Milne advised Robertson (5 November) that the Germans would do all they could to keep her in the war.|$|E
2500|$|On page 124, Bonaparte wrote, [...] "He had in {{his rear}} the denies of the forest of Soignes, so that, if beaten, retreat was impossible", and on page 158 — [...] "The enemy must have seen with affright how many {{difficulties}} the field of battle he had chosen was about to throw {{in the way of}} his retreat", and again on page 207 — [...] "The position of Mont-Saint-Jean was ill-chosen. The first requisite of a field of battle, is, to have no defiles in its rear. The injudicious choice of his field of battle, rendered all retreat impossible." [...] However, Napoleon's view was contradicted by Jomini, who pointed out that Wellington had good roads behind his centre and each wing which would have made a retreat through the forest safer than across an open field: Napoleon's cavalry would have been hampered by the forest in their attempts to turn any retreat into a rout. Some have argued that there was no bottom to the forest and it would not have hampered an extraction given Wellington's superlative expertise in handling an army disengaging from the enemy, while others have suggested that Wellington <b>if</b> <b>pressed</b> intended to retreat eastwards towards Blücher's Prussian army so the interior of the wood was of little military significance.|$|E
