40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between executive word choices and investor evaluations. Although the importance of language in organizations and the legitimating effect of language for new ventures has stimulated rich theoretical and empirical discussion, scholars still know little about whether, how, and when the language used by executives at established organizations influences external constituents (e. g., investors). I address these questions using two studies. In the first study, drawing from theories of persuasion and attitude change in social psychology, I {{examine the effect of}} emotional messages used by executives on investor evaluations and identify persuasion as one path by which <b>executive</b> <b>language</b> influences investors. In the second study, I combine two theoretical perspectives, the market signaling theory in economics and the construe-level theory in psychology, and investigate the effect of executives' use of realism words on investor evaluations. The second study identified signaling as another path by which <b>executive</b> <b>language</b> influences investors. Hypotheses from both studies were tested using a sample of 4, 324 verbatim transcripts of 694 organizations' executive presentations at investor conferences between 2004 and 2010. This dissertation contributes to the strategy literature by providing an alternative theoretical framework that focuses on the psychological effect of executives' word choice, and by identifying two paths by which the language of executives in established organizations influence investor evaluations...|$|E

40|$|Background: Executive {{function}} {{difficulties are}} prevalent {{in children with}} autism spectrum disorders (ASD) {{and there are several}} indications of a modifying relationship between <b>executive</b> functions and <b>language</b> in children. However, there is limited research on the relationship between <b>executive</b> functioning and <b>language</b> in young children with ASD. The current study compared real-world executive functioning between groups of children with ASD, language disorders (LD), and typical development (TD). Method: The study included 256 children from three to five years of age with ASD (n = 60), LD (n = 132), and TD (n = 246). Assessment of executive functioning was based on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning – Preschool Version (BRIEF-P; Gioia, Espy, & Isquith, 2003). Group comparisons, using multivariate analyses of variance, were conducted to examine whether there were differences or similarities in executive functioning between the three groups. Relations between <b>executive</b> functioning, <b>language,</b> IQ, ASD symptom severity, and gender were examined, using correlational analyses. Results: Executive functions were impaired in both the ASD and LD groups compared to the children with TD. Levels of executive functioning were associated with language abilities in all the groups, but the ASD group showed executive function difficulties more independently of language ability. Conclusion: The results indicate there is a modifying relationship between <b>executive</b> functioning and <b>language</b> in pre-school children with ASD, LD, and TD. Pre-school children with ASD may experience more severe executive functioning difficulties than pre-school children with LD. This might have implications for the {{understanding of the nature of}} executive functioning in ASD...|$|R

40|$|Behavioural variant frontotemporal {{dementia}} {{is characterized by}} a change in comportment. It is associated with considerable functional decline {{over the course of the}} illness albeit with sometimes dramatic variability among patients. It is unknown whether any baseline features, or combination of features, could predict rate of functional decline in behavioural variant {{frontotemporal dementia}}. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different baseline clinical, neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, genetic and anatomic predictors on the rate of functional decline as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes scale. We identified 86 subjects with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia that had multiple serial Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes assessments (mean 4, range 2 – 18). Atlas-based parcellation was used to generate volumes for specific regions of interest at baseline. Volumes were utilized to classify subjects into different anatomical subtypes using the advanced statistical technique of cluster analysis and were assessed as predictor variables. Composite scores were generated for the neuropsychological domains of <b>executive,</b> <b>language,</b> memory and visuospatial function. Behaviours from the brief questionnaire form of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory were assessed. Linear mixed-effects regression modelling was used to determine which baseline features predict rate of future functional decline. Rates of functional decline differed across the anatomical subtypes of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, with faster rates observed in the frontal dominant and frontotemporal subtypes. In addition, subjects with poorer performance on neuropsychological tests of <b>executive,</b> <b>language</b> and visuospatial function, less disinhibition, agitation/aggression and night-time behaviours at presentation, and smaller medial, lateral and orbital frontal lobe volumes showed faster rates of decline. In many instances, the effect of the predictor variables observed across all subjects was also preserved within anatomical subtypes. Furthermore, some of the predictor variables improved our prediction of rate of functional decline after anatomical subtype was taken into account. In particular, age at onset was a highly significant predictor but only after adjusting for subtype. We also found that although some predictor variables, for example gender, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and apathy/indifference, did not affect the rate of functional decline; these variables were associated with the actual Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes score estimated for any given time-point. These findings suggest that in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, rate of functional decline is driven by the combination of anatomical pattern of atrophy, age at onset, and neuropsychiatric characteristics of the subject at baseline...|$|E

The working memory and language abilities {{of the children were}} examined using an extensive battery of tests. Working memory was operationalized according to the model of Baddeley. Confirmative factor analyses revealed three memory factors: phonological, visual and central <b>executive.</b> <b>Language</b> was construed as a multifactorial construct, and confirmative factor analyses revealed four factors: lexical-semantic abilities, phonological abilities, syntactic abilities and speech production abilities. Moderate to high correlations were found between the memory and language factors. Structural equation modelling was used to further explore the relations between the different factors. Phonological memory was found to predict phonological abilities; central-executive memory predicted lexical-semantic abilities; and visual memory predicted speech production abilities. Phonological abilities also predicted syntactic abilities. Both the theoretical and clinical implications of the findings are discussed. Learning outcomes: The reader will be introduced to the concepts of multifactorial components of working memory as well as language impairment. Secondly the reader will recognize that working memory and language impairment factors can be related.

40|$|Abstract Objective: Varied neurocognitive presentations {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to anoxic encephalopathy caused by cardiac arrest (CA), most notably amnesia and more generalized cognitive deficiencies. This case study reports neuropsychological findings {{in a patient}} with anoxic encephalopathy due to CA. Method: The 47 -year-old, college educated patient suffered CA two months before examination. He was defibrillated twice, anoxic for 10 – 12 min, and had LOC for 3 days. ECG was significant for cardiomyopathy. MRI, CT, and EEG were negative. Neuropsychological evaluation assessed effort, intellectual, memory, <b>executive,</b> <b>language,</b> motor, attention, and personality functioning. Results: Examination showed amnestic disorder with profound memory impairment (WMS-III General Memory Index = 45, RAVLT Delayed Recall Raw Score = 0, and ROCFT 5 -Minute Delay T 3 ̆c 20). Intellectual functioning (WAIS-III FSIQ = 79) and attention/concentration (Working Memory Index = 99) were relatively intact. Impairments other than amnestic disorder were noted in executive functioning (WCST Perseverations T = 31), verbal fluency (FAS T = 32) and motor dexterity (Grooved Pegboard T = 29). Although the patient was not seeking disability compensation, four effort tests were administered. Three accurately classified him as a non-malingerer and one inaccurately classified him as malingering. Several embedded effort measures accurately classified the patient as nonmalingering (WCST, FTT, MMPI- 2 FBS), but some WMS-III measures incorrectly classified him “probable malingerer. ” Conclusions: CA causes amnestic disorder with additional specific neurocognitive deficits. The typical pattern of post-CA cognitive impairment can be established during post-acute recovery.

40|$|Abstract Objectives: Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome (WPW) {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} {{disorder that}} causes arrhythmia and sudden cardiac arrest (CA). This case demonstrates hypoxic encephalopathy due to CA with good subsequent cognitive recovery. The patient was a 30 -year-old woman with a Bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s degree that had CA due to WPW with 6 – 12 min of hypoxia, tonic-clonic seizures, and 3 days of coma. MRI was unremarkable but EEG showed diffuse slowing consistent with metabolic encephalopathy and spiking indicative of right hemisphere seizure activity Method: Neuropsychological examinations of intellectual, memory, <b>executive,</b> <b>language,</b> and personality functioning were conducted at 1 month and at 8 years after CA. Results: Intelligence (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition [WAIS-III] IQ = 89, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition [WAIS-IV] IQ = 96) and Working Memory (99, 100) were relatively intact over time and consistent with premorbid estimates (Wide Range Achievement Test-Third Edition [WRAT- 3] Reading = 105, Wide Range Achievement Test-Fourth Edition [WRAT- 4] = 103, WAIS Vocabulary = 9, 10). Memory (Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition; WMS-III General Memory = 69, Immediate = 72), Processing Speed (76), executive (Trails B 3 ̆c 55, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; [WCST] perseverations = 90), and language functioning (FAS = 60) were impaired 1 month after CA. Memory (Wechsler Memory Scale-Fourth Edition [WMS-IV] Delayed Memory = 82, Immediate = 83), Processing Speed (84), executive (Trails = 85, WCST perseverations = 97), and language (FAS = 85) functioning improved significantly at follow-up. Conclusion: Anoxic encephalopathy after CA produces characteristic marked impairment of memory, executive function, and processing speed {{that can be seen}} at the post-acute stage of recovery and typically has a poor prognosis. However, good recovery of cognitive functions appears to occur in some cases. Prognosis may be mediated by age, gender, and cerebral reserve.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). ALS is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by muscle weakness, spasticity and abnormal reflexes. In a very small subset of patients (5 - 15 %), ALS is associated with FTD. Furthermore, a larger subset of patients who do not suffer from overt dementia, develop subtle deficits in cognition and behaviour (up to 50 %). The changes have mostly been observed in the domains of <b>executive</b> functions, <b>language</b> and behavioural functioning. These observations have led some researchers to propose a continuum of dysfunction between ALS and FTD, ranging from an absence of neuropsychological abnormalities to mild, subclinical changes to a profile consistent with a full-blown FTD-syndrome in ALS. FTD consists of three subsyndromes; the first ‘executive-behavioural’ type, frontal variant FTD (fvFTD), is predominantly characterized by behaviour abnormalities, difficulties with using strategies and social judgement. In contrast, the other two types mainly involve problems with ‘language’, including a central degradation of knowledge for words, objects, people (semantic dementia; SD) as well as complications with speaking, spelling {{and the sounds of}} language (progressive non-fluent aphasia; PNFA). The current study aims to explore whether the cognitive-behavioural deficits found in nondemented ALS-patients can be classified as subclinical forms of the first two FTDsyndromes, i. e. fvFTD and SD. In addition, the study further examined whether <b>executive</b> and <b>language</b> impairments co-exist or rather occur independently. To answer the research questions, a battery of neuropsychological tests was employed, adapted to patients’ speech and motor disabilities, as well as behavioural questionnaires. The data revealed there was evidence of both <b>executive</b> and <b>language</b> involvement characteristic of FTD, albeit to a subtle extent. ALS-patients showed deficits on a test of Theory of Mind (ToM). On this test, participants were asked to judge the thoughts and feelings of another, using the direction of eye gaze, a cue considered to be important for social interaction. Results indicated that ALS patients had difficulties with affective ToM, i. e. recognizing feelings of others, and this effect was not driven by perceptual or attentional difficulties. In addition, patients exhibited a subtle deficit with empathy as well as a range of behavioural abnormalities. Furthermore, ALS-patients showed abnormal performance on a complex multi-modal semantic association task which involved assigning the correct picture iii to the sound of an object. This central deficit emerged in the presence of normal audio-visual information processing and episodic memory functions. Moreover, a category-specific deficit for man-made objects was detected in patients. Individual case-analyses showed that various subsets of patients were impaired on the <b>language</b> and <b>executive</b> tasks. These analyses also showed that <b>executive</b> and <b>language</b> problems can occur independently as well as simultaneously in patients with ALS. In addition, analysis of individual cases revealed that some patients’ performance on the decision making tasks was similar to that found in patients with either orbitofrontal or dorsolateral dysfunction, while there was little if any evidence of a pattern of impairment similar to that seen with anterior cingulate dysfunction. The observed difficulties with social cognition and semantic processing indicate that <b>executive</b> and <b>language</b> problems, characteristic of the two FTD syndromes, can be detected in patients with classical ALS.

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the changes in neuropsychological functioning in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) after temporal lobe resection. Methods: Fifty-four TLE patients were evaluated before and after surgery using comprehensive neuropsychological tests to assess general intelligence, <b>executive</b> functioning, <b>language,</b> verbal and visual memory, working memory, visuo-spatial ability, attention and motor function. Results: The patients with left TLE showed no impairment of neuropsychological functioning after surgery, with the exception of auditory immediate memory. Furthermore, they showed significant improvement in performance IQ, executive function, working memory, visual memory, attention and psychomotor speed. The patients with right TLE did not show any significant impairment in post-operative neuropsychological functioning. They showed improvements in intellectual and <b>executive</b> functions, <b>language,</b> visual memory, visuo-spatial ability, attention and motor function post-operatively. The patients with hippocampal sclerosis showed greater post-operative improvements than the patients without hippocampal sclerosis regardless of the side. Patients with better pre-operative neuropsychological function had a higher chance of successfully discontinuing all seizure medications after surgery. Discussion: The {{results of this study suggest}} that temporal lobectomy does not harm the neuropsychological functioning of patients with intractable TLE and that it improves cognitive functions of the contralateral hemisphere. © 2009 W.

Children completed a battery of standardized language assessments, standardized questionnaires assessing problem behaviors, and computerized response modulation and executive functioning tasks. Parents completed questionnaires assessing the children s executive functioning and problem behaviors. Correlational and regression analyses revealed that executive functioning and response modulation represent distinct, yet related, cognitive processes which contribute differentially to language ability and behavior problems in school-age children.
