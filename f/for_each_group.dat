5|$|Under Andriamasinavalona's rule, the {{political}} administration of Imerina became more clearly defined.

These territorial divisions were strictly enforced: members of subcastes were required to live within their designated territories and were not authorized to stay for extended periods in the territories reserved for others. Andriamasinavalona decentralized governance and strengthened the power of local administrators by creating a series of new decrees that further formalized {{the relationship between the}} andriana and the hova (commoners) they ruled.|$|E

30|$|The {{finding that}} age group athletes became slower in the {{mountain}} marathon ‘Jungfrau Marathon’ is controversial to reported findings for a large city marathon such as the ‘New York City Marathon’ (Jokl et al. 2004; Lepers and Cattagni 2012). The most likely explanation for this difference {{in the fact that}} we included all recorded finishers <b>for</b> <b>each</b> age <b>group</b> <b>for</b> our analysis while Jokl et al. (2004) considered the fastest 50 women and men <b>for</b> <b>each</b> age <b>group</b> and Lepers and Cattagni (2012) the ten fastest women and men. With an increasing participation in the ‘New York City Marathon’ the density of elite runners might become higher and therefore the fastest 10 and fastest 50 finishers became faster. On the other side, an increase of the participation might lower the average performance level. The selection of a fixed number of athletes <b>for</b> <b>each</b> age <b>group</b> (i.e. the ten fastest) may lead to a selection bias. When we consider all successful finishers <b>for</b> <b>each</b> age <b>group,</b> the number of athletes <b>for</b> <b>each</b> age <b>group</b> will increase and also include slow and weak runners who finish just within the time limit. Therefore, the mean marathon race time in an age group with a large number of finishers will be relatively high.|$|R
