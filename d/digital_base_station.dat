This novel <b>base</b> <b>station</b> concept reduces system energy consumption, complexity, size and costs, while the flexibility {{in terms of}} multi-band/multi-standard operation improves. In this work, innovative integrated core circuits for digital high-efficiency class-D and class-S power amplifiers based on gallium nitride technology were developed for the application in <b>digital</b> <b>base</b> <b>stations.</b> Therefore, high power heterostructure field effect transistors are investigated and optimized for switch-mode operation in close relation to physical device parameters like gate capacitances and on-resistance.

Moreover, advanced technology options such as gate-recess to achieve normally-off device operation and integrated Schottky-diodes have been successfully implemented in order to improve the over-all circuit properties.

40|$|Analog-to-digital {{converter}} (ADC) {{is a very}} {{fundamental and}} key part to nearly all kinds of electronics. The applications cover a wide range requiring different resolution to different sampling rate, including UWB systems, radar detection, wide band radio receivers, optical communication links, CCD imaging, ultrasonic medical imaging, <b>digital</b> receivers, <b>base</b> <b>stations,</b> <b>digital</b> video (for example, HDTV), xDSL, cable modems, and fast Ethernet. Among them, lower resolution very high speed ADC is a critical part for building UWB system, disk drive read channels and optical communication. This thesis consists of two parts. The first part focuses {{on the design of}} a high speed low resolution flash ADC in 90 nm technology. Capacitive interpolation technique was used in this flash ADC {{in order to reduce the}} hardware requirement and input capacitance. No sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit is needed since the distributed capacitors (including capacitors in the very front end and the interpolated capacitors) serve to sample and hold the signals. Offset cancellation and averaging techniques are also implemented to reduce the offsets and the non-linearity. The ADC design achieves a sampling speed of 2. 3 GSps with 4 bits resolution in 90 nm CMOS technology. The second part describes a new comprehensive ADC design methodology for capacitive interpolated flash ADCs, aiming to provide a quantitative, yet handy design guideline for circuit designers to conduct practical ADC designs. This new ADC design methodology provides a quantitative and comprehensive mapping between ADC chip level performance specs and various design parameters at different levels, such as, interpolation factor, number of stages, pre-amplifier bandwidth, loading effects, transistor sizes, technology parameters and etc. It serves to allow IC designers to conduct quick and quantitative flash ADC designs for well-balanced overall chip performance in practices. A dynamic power consumption analysis technique for capacitive interpolated flash ADCs is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} face acute {{security concerns}} in {{applications such as}} battlefield monitoring. A central point of failure in a sensor network is the <b>base</b> <b>station,</b> which acts as a collection point of sensor data. In this paper, we investigate two attacks {{that can lead to}} isolation or failure of the <b>base</b> <b>station.</b> In one set of attacks, the <b>base</b> <b>station</b> is isolated by blocking communication between sensor nodes and the <b>base</b> <b>station,</b> e. g. by DOS attacks. In the second attack, the location of the <b>base</b> <b>station</b> is deduced by analyzing data traffic towards the <b>base</b> <b>station,</b> which can lead to jamming and/or discovery and destruction of the <b>base</b> <b>station.</b> To defend against these attacks, two secure strategies are proposed. First, secure multi-path routing to multiple destination <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> is designed to provide intrusion tolerance against isolation of a <b>base</b> <b>station.</b> Second, anti-traffic analysis strategies are proposed to help disguise the location of the <b>base</b> <b>station</b> from eavesdroppers.
