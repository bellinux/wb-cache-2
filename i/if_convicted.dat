5|$|Before {{the end of}} {{his first}} season on Ally McBeal, over the Thanksgiving 2000 holiday, Downey was arrested when his room at Merv Griffin's Hotel and Givenchy Spa in Palm Springs, California was searched by the police, who were {{responding}} to an anonymous 911 call. Downey was under the influence of a controlled substance and in possession of cocaine and Valium. Despite the fact that, <b>if</b> <b>convicted,</b> he could face a prison sentence of up to four years and eight months, he signed on to appear in at least eight more Ally McBeal episodes.|$|E
5|$|Boyars {{could no}} longer be {{executed}} without the knowledge and approval of the Transylvanian Prince and, <b>if</b> <b>convicted</b> for treason, their fortunes {{could no longer}} be confiscated. Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said in a conversation with the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: …they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but as their own good required and obtained privileges for themselves. He would try to avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E
5|$|Edith Chaykoski {{died from}} her wounds at Windsor Metropolitan Hospital at about 05:30 on 26 June. Police searched the {{neighbourhood}} {{during the morning}} and found the shotgun where Lamb had thrown it. They identified it as Hesketh's {{and concluded that the}} 18-year-old must have taken it and gone on a shooting spree the previous day. Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a mandatory death penalty <b>if</b> <b>convicted.</b> When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge.|$|E

5000|$|Errors of {{impunity}} is a {{term used}} in Brian Forst's book Errors of Justice and in Robert Bohm's introduction to {{a special edition of}} The Journal of Criminal Justice on miscarriages of justice. They are defined as lapses that result in criminals either remaining at large or receiving sanctions that are below a socially optimal level. [...] <b>If</b> <b>convicting</b> an innocent person, called a miscarriage of justice, is a Type I error for falsely identifying culpability (a [...] "false positive"), then an error of impunity would be a Type II error of failing to find a culpable person guilty (a [...] "false negative").|$|R
5000|$|Sixteen-year-old Tyler {{was charged}} {{as an adult}} for first-degree murder, which under state law {{required}} the death penalty <b>if</b> he was <b>convicted.</b> <b>If</b> it had not prosecuted as been a capital crime {{and he had been}} charged as a juvenile, his maximum sentence would have been imprisonment in a juvenile facility until age 21.|$|R
5|$|In July 2004 Massino {{was convicted}} in a murder and {{racketeering}} indictment based on the testimony of several cooperating made men, including Massino's disgruntled underboss and brother-in-law Salvatore Vitale. He was also facing the death penalty <b>if</b> <b>convicted</b> in a separate murder trial due to be held later that year, but after agreeing to testify against his former associates {{he was sentenced to}} life imprisonment for both indictments in 2005. Massino testified twice for the government, helping win a murder conviction against his acting boss Vincent Basciano in 2011, and was resentenced to time served in 2013, though he will be on supervised release {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|The {{renewal of}} his license {{was due to}} the fact that while there is a central {{registry}} of crimes and of traffic misdemeanors, no such registry exists for other misdemeanors in the Czech Republic. In the case where a non-traffic misdemeanor is solved on the spot (e.g. fining by a policeman), no record of it is made. Only when the investigated person or the police refuse to deal with the misdemeanor on the spot, is an administrative proceeding before a municipal misdemeanor committee initiated and <b>if</b> <b>convicted,</b> then a record of it is made by the municipality.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil, {{together}} with Sasson Barashy, Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa, were extradited to the US, arriving in Los Angeles on January 13, aboard an American government airplane. They {{were being held}} in the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, facing a 77-page, 32-count federal indictment that alleges murder, massive embezzlement, money laundering, racketeering and running a large Los Angeles-based Ecstasy ring. The trial was set for November 8, 2011 in the Los Angeles Federal District Court. <b>If</b> <b>convicted,</b> they may face life imprisonment, but not the death penalty, as US authorities have promised their Israeli counterparts that even if found guilty of murder, the five suspects would not be given the death penalty. Under {{the terms of the}} extradition agreement, they would likely serve their sentence in an Israeli prison. Shortly after the extradition, a threatening letter was found under the car of the wife of the Prosecutor who was involved in the extradition.|$|E

5|$|On December 31, 2008, Bellaire police {{officers}} confronted Robbie Tolan, {{the son of}} former Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan, in the driveway of his house at the 800 block of Woodstock. Officers suspected Tolan, who was unarmed, of stealing a sports utility vehicle in the driveway and shot Tolan in the chest; Tolan's family owned the vehicle. Tolan was hospitalized with injuries to one lung and a liver. The incident sparked allegations of racial profiling. Members of minority groups reported that Bellaire police racially profiled people. In 2002, José Cruz, Jr., son of baseball player José Cruz, was stopped since his vehicle was missing a front license plate. He was arrested by Bellaire police and spent one night in jail after Bellaire law enforcement {{told him that he}} had a warrant for his arrest. The Houston Chronicle said that the Bellaire police decision to arrest Cruz was a mistake. In January 2009, Cruz accused the police of racial profiling. Mayor Cindy Siegel said that she was unaware of racial profiling by police. Siegel announced that the city will investigate racial profiling and hire an independent consultant to look at traffic stop data. The local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) branch said that it established a pact with the City of Bellaire; people may report civil rights violations from Bellaire Police to the branch if the people do not wish to contact the City of Bellaire. However, the NAACP branch has not yet provided the city with any civil rights violations. On April 6, 2009, a Harris County grand jury indicted Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton, the police officer, for aggravated assault by a public servant. <b>If</b> <b>convicted,</b> Cotton could face up to life in prison. In addition the family sued the police department and the police officer. The upcoming trial in Harris County District Court on criminal felony charges against Cotton began on January 25, 2010. Jury selection was scheduled to begin on May 3, 2010. The officer was found not guilty in his criminal trial in May 2010.|$|E
25|$|Parole is {{an option}} for most prisoners. However, parole is not guaranteed, {{particularly}} for prisoners serving life or indeterminate sentences. In cases of first-degree murder, one can apply for parole after 25 years <b>if</b> <b>convicted</b> of a single murder. However, <b>if</b> <b>convicted</b> of multiple murder (either first or second-degree), the sentencing judge has the option to make parole ineligibility periods consecutive - thereby extending parole ineligibility beyond 25 years and, in rare cases, beyond a normal life-span.|$|E
