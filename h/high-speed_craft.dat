2500|$|The Hoverbarge {{technology}} is somewhat different from high-speed hovercraft, which {{has traditionally been}} constructed using aircraft technology. The initial concept of the air cushion barge {{has always been to}} provide a low-tech amphibious solution for accessing construction sites using typical equipment found in this area, such as diesel engines, ventilating fans, winches and marine equipment. The load to move a 200ton payload ACV barge at [...] would only be 5tons. The skirt and air distribution design on <b>high-speed</b> <b>craft</b> again is more complex, as they have to cope with the air cushion being washed out by a wave and wave impact. The slow speed and large mono chamber of the hover barge actually helps reduce the effect of wave action, giving a very smooth ride.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the difference in the level of fatigue induced by <b>high-speed</b> maritime <b>craft</b> operation between the day- and night-shift officers. The demographic and work-related factors that contribute to fatigue were also explored. A total of 93 <b>high-speed</b> maritime <b>craft</b> officers participated in the survey, of whom 35 worked a day shift (Mean age= 48. 3 years) and 58 worked a night shift (Mean age= 45. 8 years). Fatigue experience was measured with the Chinese version of the Swedish Occupational Fatigue Inventory (SOFI-C) at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the work shift. Information on age, work experience, perceived voyage difficulty and duty schedule was obtained. The study found that the night-shift officers seemed to manifest an overall higher level of perceived fatigue than the day-shift officers, while the day-shift officers demonstrated a fatigue carry-over effect across the two workdays. Besides the shift pattern, age, experience in operating <b>high-speed</b> maritime <b>craft</b> and perceived voyage difficulty were the significant factors contributing to the officers’ fatigue experience. The finding that the fatigue experience associated with <b>high-speed</b> maritime <b>craft</b> operation has a rapid and accumulative nature suggests that different occupational safety and health guidelines should be devised for these two groups of officers.

40|$|High speed crafts are {{increasingly}} replacing conventional low speed crafts. With this increase has come recognition of problems due to speed increase and wave wash associated with it. Pressure is increasing on regulatory bodies {{to act on}} the wash induced impacts on the safety of people, craft, ecology and environment. Waves created by <b>high-speed</b> <b>crafts</b> are often significantly high in the far field and the size of these waves increases when the water depth reduces from a very deep to a deep one and then to a shallow region. The effects become magnified when the width of the waterway also gets restricted. So the operation of such crafts needs to be controlled accordingly to avoid damage to environment and risk to persons and other crafts operating in the region. These responsibilities are vested with designer, builder, operator and owner of the craft and also with the port authorities. Therefore {{it would be useful to}} estimate the size of the waves created by a vessel before it is put to operation in a region. These estimations should eventually lead to the route optimisation for the existing crafts in their respective operating port, by keeping the wave wash within acceptable limits, and to the evolution of new generation of <b>high-speed</b> <b>crafts</b> with low wave wash. High speed craft generated waves generally comprise of long and short period waves. The height of the long period waves increases when the depth of water decreases and at the same time the wavelength decreases resulting in the increase of wave steepness and this may lead to the breaking of the wave. The form and nature of the breaking of a wave will vary with the slope of the coast and seabed. The level of water will influence the position of the break point and the break point will move closer to the coastline at high water. As longer waves are faster they reach the coast earlier. Short-period waves subside faster than long-period waves and hence longer waves are more observed at greater distance from the vessel track. Interference effects of wave systems generated by different vessels, mainly when they operate in the close proximity, are again of concern to a naval architect. Sailing of vessels through shallow water is more complex than in deep water. In shallow water region the pattern of the wave generated by the vessel is very much dependent on the water-depth based Froude number than on the vessel-length based Froude number. A vessel generates the highest waves when the depth based Fn is about 1. 0, the speed of the vessel at this condition being termed as critical speed, which should be avoided. Carrying out experimental studies using vessel models at scaled down water depth can perform the estimation of far field waves. But the tank width limitations of the available hydrodynamic test facilities and the cost and time involved in it may put constraint on the above mode of estimation. As another option the waves can be estimated theoretically. Since the <b>high-speed</b> <b>crafts</b> considered here are slender in form, the linear wave theory can be applied...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of naval vessels towards <b>high-speed</b> <b>crafts</b> subjected to severe sea conditions has promoted an increasing interest in lightweight high-strength materials. Due to its strength and weight characteristics, aluminum {{has been proven}} especially suitable as construction material for hull structures, {{as well as other}} vessel parts. However, fatigue in aluminum naval crafts needs to be effectively addressed for the proper life-cycle assessment. Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems constitute effective tools for measuring the structural response and assessing the structural performance under actual operational conditions. In this paper, an approach for using SHM information in the fatigue reliability analysis and service life prediction of aluminum naval vessels is presented. The accumulated fatigue damage and the fatigue reliability are quantified based on SHM data acquired under different operational conditions, specified by the ship speeds, sea states, and heading angles. Additionally, an approach for estimating the reliability-based fatigue life under a given operational profile is presented.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of complementary numerical study done in the continuation of the activities carried out by the Committee III. 1 ‘‘Ultimate Strength’’ of ISSC’ 2003 (Ref. 28). The main focus of the paper concerns the post-buckling behaviour and strength characteristics of the aluminium multi-stiffened panels under combined axial compression and lateral pressure. The finite element model proposed by the Committee III. 1 ‘‘Ultimate Strength’’ of ISSC’ 2003 is used in the present investigation. Material is aluminium alloy AA 6082 -T 6 and the multi-stiffened panel is a triple-span structure. Stiffeners are of either extruded or non-extruded angle-bar profiles. An initial deflection is imposed on the model in a procedure similar to that applied by the Committee III. 1. General purpose finite element code ANSYS is used for non-linear elastic–plastic analyses. Main objectives are to study the influence of initial deflections and also HAZ on the post-buckling behaviour and collapse characteristics of aluminium stiffened panels under combined axial compression and lateral pressure. Different values of lateral pressure are exerted on the model in a systematic manner to simulate various levels of lateral pressure loading on multi-stiffened aluminium panels used in the construction of <b>high-speed</b> <b>crafts...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a philosophical, theoretical, practical and methodological {{discussion of the}} relationship between humans and technology in relation to technically assisted movement. The themes are investigated in five articles. In particular, the philosophical foundation of different perspectives on the relationship between humans and technology are discussed with a special emphasis on movement. The thesis then proceeds to present a case study of <b>high-speed</b> <b>crafts</b> in military service. The empirical data is gathered through the use of participatory observation. The operation of this type of ship is characterised by hazardous and uncertain conditions. High speed craft operation is considered very demanding for the navigators in terms of maintaining safety and efficiency. The observation accumulated over 120 hours of video recorded material of the crew during ship operation. This serves as a basis for a discussion and explication of specific theoretical frameworks for conceptual modelling of ship manoeuvring, as well as design of prototypes of new technological artefacts intended for the operation of the ship class. Further, this thesis addresses the issue of methodological challenges when studying elaborate human-technology systems by discussing the use of video in field observation.

40|$|Abstract — Propeller design aims at {{achieving}} high propulsive efficiency at {{low levels}} of vibration and noise, usually with minimum cavitation. Achieving this aim is difficult with conventional propellers, as ships have become larger and faster propeller diameters have remained limited by draught and other factors. Surface piercing propeller offers an attractive alternative to <b>high-speed</b> <b>crafts,</b> which operate under limited draught. The performance of the vehicle depends upon {{the efficiency of the}} propeller. The geometric shape and its surface finish will decide the efficiency of the propeller. The material used is carbon UD and aluminium. The present research basically deals with the modeling and Analysis of the propeller using composite material of a marine vehicle having low draft. A propeller is complex 3 D model geometry. CATIA modeling software is used for generating the blade model and tool path on the computer. Sectional data, pitch angle of the propeller are the inputs for the development of propeller model. Finite element analysis was carried out using ABAQUS.
