5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time — the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a small respite not capitalized {{as much as it}} could have been.|$|E

5|$|The bank {{building}} was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it {{and made it}} home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.|$|E

25|$|The Rum Rebellion {{has slipped}} into {{historical}} oblivion {{because it is}} widely misunderstood. It is popular belief that the autocratic Bligh was removed because he threatened the huge profits that were being made from trading in spirits by the officers of the NSW Corps and by businessmen such as John Macarthur. This view suggests <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a squabble between equally unsavoury parties.|$|E
25|$|Opinions {{about the}} {{importance}} and reach of P2 differ. Some see the P2 as a reactionary, shadow government ready to preempt a take over of power {{in case of an}} electoral victory of the Italian Communist Party. Others think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a sordid association of people eager to improve their careers by making powerful and important connections. Nevertheless, P2 was implicated in numerous Italian scandals and mysteries.|$|E

If the Australian team depends on Queenslanders to strengthen it, one is afraid it will be found wanting. They are quite the weakest lot of footballers I have even seen come down from Queensland. The play needs no detailed description as it was simply a practice match for NSW, and certainly did not advantageously advertise the new game.|$|E

25|$|Closer to {{the moment}} of the attack, the attacking planes were {{detected}} and tracked as they approached by an Army radar installation being operated that morning as a mostly unofficial training exercise. The Opana Point radar station, operated by two enlisted men (Pvts. Lockard and Elliot) plotted the approaching force, and their relief team plotted them returning to the carriers. Elliott called in the reading to the information center. The call was received by Pvt. Joseph McDonald. McDonald found Lt Kermit A. Tyler, the officer in charge at the barely operational warning information center at Pearl Harbor. He informed Tyler a large number of planes were coming in from the north and he had never received a call like this before. Tyler told McDonald <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Samuel Maverick ever owned any other cattle and no other stock at all, beyond a few horses. One can reasonably doubt that a man who was not in the cattle business and who did not work with or live near his herd would have been engaged in branding strays. The record suggests that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more than lack of interest in property he never wanted that led to his name becoming associated {{with one of the most}} enduring terms of the Old West and a natural subject for every manner of speculation and inventive tale. The accounts conveyed by other contributors have been left unaltered, to be taken, together with Mrs. Maverick's material, as illustrative of this phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} Reese and Bianca's wedding, Kendall refuses {{to attend the}} ceremony. Zach tries to {{convince}} her to change her mind, saying that she is acting childish, but Kendall explains that he and Bianca betrayed her. Bianca receives word that Kendall will not be coming to her wedding and immediately rushes to Kendall's home to insist she attend. Kendall says that she will only come to the wedding as long as Bianca promises to leave for Paris soon afterward and take Reese and baby Gabrielle with her. Bianca reluctantly agrees. Later that night, Reese and Bianca have a wedding rehearsal. Kendall picks up a wine glass and makes a snarky toast to Reese and Bianca but particularly to Reese. Reese becomes upset; she grabs a bottle of wine, a glass, and walks off. Bianca follows her, but Reese wants to be alone. Zach later finds Reese and consoles her. He pulls her into a hug and then kisses her passionately; Reese kisses back. After a few moments, with Ryan having witnessed their kiss, unknown to them, they agree that the kiss never happened and that they already have people they are deeply in love with. Ryan later confronts Zach about the kiss, but Zach says <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> and nonchalantly walks away from Ryan.|$|E

25|$|Asafa {{opened his}} 2011 season on 16 April at the National Stadium in Kingston, Jamaica. He ran the 200m {{where he came}} in third after {{what looked to be}} a good first 140m, slowing down {{significantly}} at {{the last quarter of the}} race. His time was 20.55s for the race behind Yohan Blake and Daniel Bailey. Powell ran his next race was the 4x100m relay USA vs The World at the Penn Relays 2011, on 28 April. He ran the unusual first leg for Jamaica as he blasted off like a bullet to give Jamaica the lead. Jamaica won the event in a world leading time of 38.33s, ahead of USA Red and USA Blue teams respectively. He stated after the run that he was in good shape and was looking forward to do great things in the year ahead. Powell next ran the 200m at the Jamaica International Invitational Meet on 7 May. He looked promising in the first 120m, after which he slowed down drastically, finishing in last place with a time of 21.40s, in a race won by Jamaican Nickel Ashmeade. He later stated that he felt a minor pain in his hamstring and he backed off as a precaution, but insisted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> serious.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} {{meeting of the}} 2011 IAAF Diamond League at Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, Powell won the 100m {{with a time of}} 9.95 seconds. Powell next ran at the IAAF Diamond League in Rome against Usain Bolt on 26 May. Powell had a superb start and mid but he faded towards the end, only to allow the world record holder to surpass him in the final 10–12m of the race. Bolt won in 9.91s and Powell came second in 9.93s. He said that he had lost focus, but is {{confident}} about beating Usain after what he had done that day. Powell next competed in the IAAF World Challenge in Rabat, Morocco, in a low key meet. There, after running the first 20m, he pulled up and finished last in 36.13s, citing a precaution against a serious hamstring injury. Reports said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> serious and he would be ready for the Jamaican Trials later in the month. At the Jamaican Trials 23–24 July, Powell looked impressive as he qualified through the rounds. He posted a season best of 9.90s in his semi-final, despite easing off in the final 15m. Later, after overcoming a bad start, Powell won the final to be titled National Champion for the fifth time in his career. He won in a time of 10.08s into a 1.8m/s headwind. Yohan Blake and Steve Mullings were second and third respectively with 0.01s separating them.|$|E
