2500|$|LNG is transported {{using both}} tanker truck, railway tanker, and purpose built ships known as LNG carriers. LNG will be {{sometimes}} taken to cryogenic temperatures {{to increase the}} tanker capacity. The first commercial ship-to-ship transfer (STS) transfers were undertaken in February 2007 at the Flotta facility in Scapa Flow with 132,000 m3 of LNG being passed between the vessels Excalibur and Excelsior. [...] Transfers have also been carried out by Exmar Shipmanagement, the Belgian <b>gas</b> <b>tanker</b> owner in the Gulf of Mexico, which involved the transfer of LNG from a conventional LNG carrier to an LNG regasification vessel (LNGRV).

2500|$|The {{addition}} of the Liquified natural <b>gas</b> <b>tanker</b> contracts in the early 1970s meant that the yard was due for another conversion. General Dynamics then invested $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) into more ways and wet basins in the yard, {{in order to be}} more competitive. The yard began construction of all of the Wichita-class replenishment oilers, with the exception of [...] Cost overruns were an issue with these ships, although eventually the costs were negotiated. Furthermore, the yard built four of the Anchorage-class dock landing ships, which were delivered between 1970 and 1972. These ships were involved in cost overruns as well, and in 1975 the Naval Sea Systems Command awarded the yard $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) for these overruns.|$|E

25|$|Rogaland was {{a heavily}} trafficked sea lanes in the country, with about 300,000 annual sailings and about ten annual accidents. The decisive reason for {{establishing}} a VTS {{in the area}} was {{the establishment of a}} gas terminal at Kårstø. It receives about six hundred annual <b>gas</b> <b>tankers.</b> The environmental impact of an accident was considered so high that increased precautions were needed. VTSes are cover their operating expenses entirely through charging a safety fee on all commercial ships docking in the jurisdiction. Half the operating costs of Kvitsøy were placed on <b>gas</b> <b>tankers</b> to Kårstø, initially 74 øre per gross tonnage. All other ships were charged 19 øre per gross tonne. There were local reactions to this, as Rogaland ports would have a charge which for instance Bergen Port would not receive, as Fedje VTS was entirely financed through fees levied on tankers.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Fearnley & Eger, a {{shipping}} company likewise based in Norway, decided {{to expand its}} <b>gas</b> <b>tanker</b> fleet and commissioned seven gas carriers. One order was passed to Bergesen and another to Gotaas-Larsen A/S. However, Fearnley & Eger faced financial difficulty in seeing the remaining deals through and another four of their contracts were transferred to Bergesen. Bergesen would also acquire the other vessel from Gotaas-Larsen A/S. These six LPG tankers were the first of Bergesen's <b>gas</b> <b>tanker</b> fleet.By the late 1980s, Bergesen was a prominent owner and operator of large LPG tankers. In 1999, {{it was decided that}} Bergesen would specialise in large and very large gas carriers while A.P. Møller managed small gas carriers and Exmar focused on medium gas carriers.|$|E
