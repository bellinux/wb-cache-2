40|$|Recently, {{transmission}} {{steel tower}} {{has been increasing}} and welded <b>Neck</b> <b>Flange</b> joint has been applied steel tower for post joint. However, welding process has a somewhat undesirable effect of adversely affecting the toughness of the weld bond at welded joints. In order to secure the safety of steel tower, therefor, the study on fracture toughness welded <b>Neck</b> <b>Flange</b> joint is one of important problems. In this experiment, the authors carried out COD bend test with weld test specimens of SM 4 IB and STK 55 steels which were welded using CO 2 arc process. From {{the results of these}} tests, the characteristics of fracture toughness were evaluated on the welded <b>Neck</b> <b>Flange</b> joint...|$|R
25|$|Examples {{of parts}} made by this process are: wheel hub unit bearings, {{transmission}} gears, {{tapered roller bearing}} races, stainless steel coupling <b>flanges,</b> and <b>neck</b> rings for LP gas cylinders. Manual transmission gears are an example of automatic hot forging {{used in conjunction with}} cold working.|$|R
50|$|A weld <b>neck</b> <b>flange</b> (also {{known as}} a high-hub flange and tapered hub flange) {{is a type of}} flange. There are two designs. The regular type is used with pipes. The long type is {{unsuitable}} for pipes and is used in process plant. A weld <b>neck</b> <b>flange</b> consists of a circular fitting with a protruding rim around the circumference. Generally machined from a forging, these flanges are typically butt welded to a pipe. The rim has a series of drilled holes that permit the flange to be affixed to another flange with bolts.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{calculation}} of gasket load drop caused by internal pressure at flange joints. The method published here makes possible {{to take into consideration}} the stiffness effect of the integrated part of the flange ring. The equations published refer to large size welding <b>neck</b> <b>flanges</b> but the method itself can be applied at any other types of flange joint, too. During the determination of the flange rotational stiffness the model shaped up by MURRAY and STUART [4] for calculating stress-state of welding <b>neck</b> <b>flanges</b> should have been made more precise. The preciseness of this method, as well as the convergence of trial-and-error calculations used were proved by results of calculations carried out on flange joint...|$|R
50|$|B16.36- Orifice Flanges. This Standard covers flanges (similar {{to those}} covered in ASME B16.5) that have orifice {{pressure}} differential connections. Coverage {{is limited to}} the following: (a) welding <b>neck</b> <b>flanges</b> Classes 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500, and 2500 (b) slip-on and threaded Class 300.|$|R
50|$|A weld <b>neck</b> <b>flange</b> {{is joined}} to a piping system by butt welding. Although its long neck (or hub) makes it expensive, it reduces {{mechanical}} stress on piping by distributing stress between {{the base of}} the flange and the wall at the weld. Turbulence and erosion are reduced due to the matching size of the pipe and flange.|$|R

2500|$|The helmet may be {{described}} {{by the number of}} bolts which hold it to the suit or to the corselet, and the number of vision ports, known as lights. For example, a helmet with four vision ports, and twelve studs securing the suit to the corselet, would be known as a [...] "four light, twelve bolt helmet", and a three-bolt helmet used three bolts to secure the bonnet to the corselet, clamping the <b>flange</b> of the <b>neck</b> seal between the two parts of the helmet.|$|R
50|$|The very {{distinctive}} helmet of the secutor {{had only}} two small eye-holes, {{in order to prevent}} a retiarius's trident from being thrust through the face, as well as a rounded top, so as not to get caught in a net. The <b>flanges</b> protecting his <b>neck</b> were smooth and shaped like fish fins for this purpose. Because of the weight and lack of space in the helmet, the secutor had to win quickly, lest he fall to exhaustion or faint due to breath constrictions and heavy armor.|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} 10 - 15 years, flange joints {{designed}} for metal-to-metal face contact with self seating and pressure activated seal rings {{have been used}} extensively in high-pressure applications in industrial piping, pressure vessels, pipelines, risers and associated equipment. These flange joints are generally much smaller and lighter, with smaller bolts, than equally rated standard gasketed flange joints, and are often called compact flange joints. This paper provides all necessary information to design compact flange joints for pressure and external loads and made from any suitable material. The paper includes design methods for design of the seal ring, flange and bolts in addition to assembly guidelines. Weld <b>neck</b> <b>flanges,</b> where the hub is of uniform thickness are discussed in detail. Similar method as presented {{has been applied to}} design compact flange joints with great success for many years...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} insure the {{accuracy}} of steam turbine thermal test in power plant, the flowrate measurement accuracy of condensate water should be insured. In this paper, the portable and integrated type flow measuring device for condensate water of 300 MW steam turbine flow is designed, {{which is based on}} the condensate water parameters and the specific pipeline conditions at the exit of the No. 5 low pressure heater for 300 MW unit. A integration of non standard differential pressure orifice flow meter is designed in this paper Through calibration in standard experimental system, the reason of the large error is that the flow field is disturbed by the origin plate type downward welding connecting flanges. Then the welding <b>neck</b> <b>flanges</b> is designed for the connecting flanges. The distribution of connecting flanges of flow field is weaken, and the measurement accuracy can meet the demand of steam turbine thermal test...|$|R
5000|$|Progressive {{stamping}} {{can also}} be produced on transfer presses. These are presses that transfer the components from one station to the next {{with the use of}} mechanical [...] "fingers". For mass production of stamped parts which do require complicated in-press operations, it is always advisable to use a progressive press. One of the advantages of this type of press is the production cycle time. Depending upon the part, productions can easily run well over 800 parts/minute. One of the disadvantages of this type of press {{is that it is not}} suitable for high precision deep drawing which is when the depth of the stamping exceeds the diameter of the part. When necessary, this process is performed upon a transfer press, which run at slower speeds, and rely on the mechanical fingers to hold the component in place during the entire forming cycle. In the case of the progressive press, only part of the forming cycle can be guided by spring-loaded sleeves or similar, which result in concentricity and ovality issues and non uniform material thickness. Other disadvantages of progressive presses compared to transfer presses are: increased raw material input required to transfer parts, tools are much more expensive because they are made in blocks with very little independent regulation per station; impossibility to perform processes in the press that require the part leave the strip (example beading, <b>necking,</b> <b>flange</b> curling, thread rolling, rotary stamping etc.).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the industrial process of hot forging a flange. The authors developed several thermomechanical models of the forging process for which they carried out computer simulations using the MSC. Marc 2013 software. In the Jawor Forge <b>flanges</b> with a <b>neck</b> are manufactured by hot forging in crank presses with a maximum load of 25 MN. The input material, {{in the form of a}} square bar, is heated up to a temperature of 1150 °C and then formed in three operations: upsetting, preliminary die forging and finishing die forging. The main aim of the studies and the numerical analyses, in which the geometry of the tools would be modified, was to maximally reduce the amount of the input material taking into account the capabilities of the Jawor Forge, and consequently to significantly reduce the production costs. Besides the Forge’s equipment resources, the main constraint for modifications was the flange-with-neck forging standard which explicitely defines the tolerances for this element. The studies, which included numerical modelling, infrared measurements and technological tests, consisted in changing the geometry of the tools and that of the forging preform. As a result, the optimum direction for modifications aimed at reducing the mass of the input material was determined. The best of the solutions, making it possible to produce a correct forging in the Jawor Forge operating conditions, were adopted whereby the weight of the preform was reduced by 6. 11 %. Currently research is underway aimed at the application of the proposed and verified modifications to other flange forgings...|$|R
40|$|The 1 st {{generation}} acoustic monitoring {{package was}} designed to detect and analyze weak acoustic signals inside natural gas transmission lines. Besides a microphone it housed a three-inch diameter aerodynamic acoustic signal amplifier to maximize sensitivity to leak induced {Delta}p type signals. The theory and test results of this aerodynamic signal amplifier was described in the master's degree thesis of our Research Assistant Deepak Mehra {{who is about to}} graduate. To house such a large three-inch diameter sensor required the use of a steel 300 -psi rated 4 inch weld <b>neck</b> <b>flange,</b> which itself weighed already 29 pounds. The completed 1 st generation Acoustic Monitoring Package weighed almost 100 pounds. This was too cumbersome to mount in the field, on an access port at a pipeline shut-off valve. Therefore a 2 nd generation and truly Portable Acoustic Monitor was built. It incorporated a fully self-contained {Delta}p type signal sensor, rated for line pressures up to 1000 psi with a base weight of only 6 pounds. This is the Rosemont Inc. Model 3051 CD-Range 0, software driven sensor, which is believed to have industries best total performance. Its most sensitive unit was purchased with a {Delta}p range from 0 to 3 inch water. This resulted in the herein described 2 nd generation: Portable Acoustic Monitoring Package (PAMP) for pipelines up to 1000 psi. Its 32 -pound total weight includes an 18 -volt battery. Together with a 3 pound laptop with its 4 -channel data acquisition card, completes the equipment needed for field acoustic monitoring of natural gas transmission pipelines...|$|R
