5|$|When Echo & the Bunnymen {{entered the}} studio to record What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> Life?, bassist Les Pattinson {{received}} news {{that his mother was}} unwell. That, coupled with Pattinson's perception that McCulloch wanted everything his way, led to Pattinson announcing his retirement from the band. McCulloch and guitarist Will Sergeant were determined to continue as Echo & the Bunnymen and recruited session musicians so they could record the album. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and was recorded at Doghouse Studios in Henley-on-Thames, Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, and Olympic Studios, Maida Vale Studios and CTS in London.|$|E
500|$|After working {{together}} as Electrafixion, McCulloch, Sergeant and Pattinson regrouped in 1997 and returned as Echo & the Bunnymen with the UK Top 10 hit [...] "Nothing Lasts Forever". An album of new material, Evergreen, was greeted enthusiastically by critics {{and the band}} made a successful return to the live arena. Though Pattinson left the group for a second time, McCulloch and Sergeant continue to record as Echo & the Bunnymen, releasing What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> Life? (1999), Flowers (2001), Siberia (2005), The Fountain (2009), and Meteorites (2014).|$|E
500|$|What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> Life? was {{released}} on 16 April 1999 through London Records following {{the release of the}} first single from the album, [...] "Rust", the previous month. One further single, [...] "Get in the Car", followed the album's release. The album received mixed reviews from the music press, being described as both flawless and having no appeal. The album was not as popular with the public as earlier releases from Echo & the Bunnymen; the album peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Albums Chart.|$|E
5000|$|The {{antidote}} to forgetting the instructions is mindfulness -- in particular, remembering. We {{need to remind}} ourselves continuously of the details. If you have forgotten what you are <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> mind, almost inevitably, you've also forgotten what you are <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> body. Start by remembering your posture. Is your spine still upright? Are you relaxed, or are you holding tension in your shoulders and arms? What are you <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> gaze? Simply checking your posture and starting your meditation over -- [...] "Now I'm placing my mind on my breath" [...] -- {{can be the most}} direct way to invoke the instructions when you've forgotten {{in the middle of a}} session.|$|R

500|$|Released in March 1999, [...] "Rust" [...] was {{the first}} single to come from What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> Life?. The single peaked at number twenty-two on the UK Singles Chart, and NME {{magazine}} named it their Single of the Week. The album was released the following month on 16 April and, having failed {{to appeal to the}} public as much as the band's previous albums, peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Albums Chart. [...] "Get in the Car", one of the tracks recorded with Fun Lovin' Criminals, was later released as a single.|$|E
500|$|Echo & the Bunnymen left London Records {{in early}} 2000. McCulloch said, [...] "What they said is, 'We'll {{keep you on}} if you don't take {{as much money as}} in the contract,' and we had no {{intention}} of staying anyway, so it was kind of 'were we pushed or did we fall?'" [...] There was also a change in the band's management with Toogood departing to start his own record label. With the session musicians who recorded What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> Life? moving on, McCulloch and Sergeant recruited a new band, with whom they would go on to record the 2000 EP, Avalanche, which was only available to buy over the internet.|$|E
500|$|What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> Life? is {{the eighth}} studio album by the English rock band Echo & the Bunnymen. The album saw the {{departure}} of bassist Les Pattinson from the group, partly due to disagreements with vocalist Ian McCulloch; McCulloch and the remaining band member, guitarist Will Sergeant, subsequently recorded the record with session musicians. The London Metropolitan Orchestra provided backing music and the American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals appeared as guest musicians on two tracks. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and it was recorded at various locations throughout England. Feeling sidelined during the recording of the album, Sergeant described it as [...] "probably the worst time in my whole life".|$|E

500|$|IGN's Travis Fickett rated [...] "The Equation" [...] 7.5/10, {{and called}} it a [...] "solid episode" [...] despite a few {{perceived}} plotholes. He liked Walter and Peter's actions in the asylum, and concluded [...] "At this point, whether a solid single episode is enough to keep you watching Fringe likely has to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> overall patience with the series and whatever its ultimate goals might be." [...] Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend called it the best episode since [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] since it contained [...] "suspense and drama and a minimal amount of conspiracy theories", making her feel [...] "seriously giddy". While still calling it [...] "entertaining", she disliked Walter seeing himself in the asylum, believing it [...] "was really strange and didn’t {{go with the flow}} of the story".|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} Echo & the Bunnymen albums, What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> <b>Your</b> Life? used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music. American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals {{appeared on the}} album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, [...] "It was probably the worst time in my whole life, doing that LP—I hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! It was a horrible experience." [...] The album {{is a collection of}} ballads and {{has been described as a}} follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, [...] "Will [...] hated the album, and I can understand why. He'd ask me where his guitar was supposed to go on certain songs and I'd say, 'Well, nowhere, it doesn't really have a place'." ...|$|E

In 2012, Styles and Montell Jordan presented the award for Best Rap/Hip Hop Record of the Year to Lecrae at the 43rd annual GMA Dove Awards.|$|E

2500|$|When {{he arrived}} back in Sydney in 1805 Macarthur further antagonised local {{authorities}} by claiming his 5,000 acres (20km²) in the Cowpastures. This was prime grazing land, well supplied by {{water from the}} Nepean river, and reserved by the Governor exclusively for the colony's cattle herds. Both Governors King and Bligh strongly objected to this and wanted the grant moved, but the Colonial Office wrote back affirming Macarthur's right to the land. Macarthur named it Camden Park after his patron. Bligh also turned down Macarthur's request for the remaining 5000 acres (20km²) after he had begun exporting wool to England. Bligh was firmly opposed to Macarthur's venture, according to Evatt, not because he objected to the fine wool industry, but because he believed that 'first preference {{should be given to}} agriculture'. As reported much later by Macarthur, Bligh said to him in a conversation at Government House; [...] "What have I to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> sheep, sir? What have I to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> cattle. Are you to have such flocks of sheep and such herds of cattle as no man ever heard of before? No, sir!".|$|E
2500|$|In Fairbanks, Stevens {{cultivated}} the city's Republican establishment. He befriended conservative {{newspaper publisher}} C.W. Snedden, who had purchased the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner in 1950. Snedden's wife Helen later recalled {{that her husband}} and Stevens were [...] "like father and son." [...] "The only problem Ted had {{was that he had}} a temper," [...] she told a reporter in 1994, crediting her husband with helping to steady Stevens [...] "like you would <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> children" [...] and with teaching Stevens the art of diplomacy.|$|E
2500|$|In Juggling (ch. 4), Easwaran {{describes}} {{feats of}} juggling that he witnessed in San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square, stating that [...] "what {{that young man}} learned {{to do with his}} body, you can learn to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> mind." [...] Mental juggling involves [...] "likes and dislikes.... Can you change your likes at will?.... We need to learn to enjoy doing something we dislike or to enjoy not doing something we like, when it is in the long-term best interests of others or ourselves." [...] Easwaran describes his own experiences in changing his eating habits, stating that he learned from Mahatma Gandhi that [...] "training the palate is a powerful aid in training the mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Papoose {{would go}} the record calling his {{collaboration}} with [...] Erykah Badu, [...] "Cure" [...] {{to be his}} favorite song he has ever made, {{and said that he}} believes the song could [...] "change the world." [...] Erykah Badu would later claim that her vocals were from over 10 years ago, and were used with out permission. He described the title track as [...] "Uplifting", and said it is about following your dreams of what you want to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> life. He would describe his verses in the song, [...] "Pimpin' Won't Die" [...] as continuations of Tupac's [...] "Brenda's Got a Baby" [...] and Slick Rick's [...] "Children's Story". He described the Brenda's Got a Baby continuation as: ...|$|E
2500|$|Jazz {{historian}} and commentator Ira Gitler declared that Tatum's [...] "left hand was {{the equal of}} his right." [...] When Bud Powell was opening for Tatum at Birdland around 1950, {{the end of an}} era when musicians engaged in overt competition and so-called cutting sessions, Powell reportedly said to Tatum, [...] "Man, I'm going to really show you about tempo and playing fast. [...] Anytime you're ready." [...] Tatum laughed and replied, [...] "Look, you come in here tomorrow, and anything you <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> right hand, I'll do with my left." [...] Powell never took up the challenge. Of note was Tatum's double-time stride playing, where his left hand alternated between playing bass notes (or tenth intervals) and mid-range chords at high speed, a device he used in showcase recordings like [...] "I Wish I Were Twins", [...] "The Shout", and [...] "Elegy".|$|E
2500|$|Paul Warfield Tibbets IV is the {{grandson}} of Paul W. Tibbets, Jr., the pilot of the aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945. He grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, and was inspired to join the United States Air Force (USAF) not by his famous grandfather but by his father, Paul W. Tibbets III, a pharmacist and hospital administrator {{who served in the}} United States Army Reserve, retiring as a colonel. [...] "When I was in 9th grade," [...] he recalled [...] "I became involved in youth service projects. It was a passion of mine to serve. My father said 'You seem to be very interested in serving – {{what do you want to}} <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> life?' I told him I was interested in serving, and he told me to look into something like the ROTC or service academies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Emin's use {{of fabric}} is diverse, {{one of her}} most famous works came from sewing letters onto her grandmother's {{armchair}} in There's A Lot of Money in Chairs (1994). The chair was very detailed, [...] "including her and her twin brother's names, the year of her grandmother's birth (1901) and the year of her birth (1963) {{on either side of the}} words another world, referring to the passing of time. An exchange between the artist and her grandmother using the nicknames they had for each other: ‘Ok Puddin, Thanks Plum’, covers the bottom front of the chair and a saying of Emin’s grandmother's, [...] "There's a lot of money in chairs", is appliquéd in pink along the top and front of its back. Behind the chair back, the first page of Exploration of the Soul, handwritten onto fabric, is appliquéd together with other dictums such as, ‘It’s not what you inherit. It’s what you <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> inheritance’".|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{their arrival}} in France, the former prisoners were brought {{together}} to undergo medical examinations. Then {{they were sent}} to different barracks to fill out forms and be interrogated. The authorities sought to assemble proof of ill-treatment, which the prisoners tended to deny {{so as to be}} reunited more quickly with their families. The poor condition of accommodations in France was noted by a number of men, including Charles Gueugnier: [...] "Entering there, the heart tightened; one was caught by an irrepressible disgust. They dared call this Augias pigsty American Park! Really, we were better and more properly housed by our Prussian enemies! Poor mothers, what will they <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> children? Those among you who miraculously came back from that ghastly mêlée more or less wounded or sick were treated here worse than dogs or pigs". The return to their homes was chaotic and deeply unorganised (no information on trains, etc.).|$|E
2500|$|Zorn was the {{principal}} [...] force in establishing The Stone in 2005, an avant-garde performance space in New York's Alphabet City which supports itself solely on donations and the sale of limited edition CDs, giving all door revenues directly to the performers. Zorn holds the title of artistic director and regularly performs 'Improvisation Nights'. Zorn feels that [...] "The Stone is a unique space and is different from Tonic, the Knitting Factory, {{and most of the}} other venues we have played at as there is no bar... so there is NO pressure to pack the house with an audience that drinks, and what night you perform has nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> power to draw a crowd or what kind of music you might play". On January 10, 2008, Zorn performed with Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson at a special benefit night at The Stone which was also released on [...] on CD.|$|E
