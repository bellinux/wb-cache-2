40|$|Across {{the globe}} {{population}} structures are aging and how older {{men and women}} interact with the transport system is increasingly important in maintaining a good {{quality of life and}} inclusion in society. The paper reviews three issues: the nature of older people’s interaction with the transport system by gender; older people’s attitude to travel; and the involvement of older people as road traffic casualties. Patterns of travel in the UK show that older people are heavily dependent on car use, but in the form of more frequent but shorter journeys than younger people. This is especially so for women over 70 years old who, as passengers, are very reliant on males to drive them. Attitudes suggest that there are few obstacles to public transport use, and most agree that bus travel is good, but convenience means many prefer cars. Involvement of older men and women in serious road traffic accidents show that they have lower killed and seriously injured (KSI) rates than 17 - 24 year old drivers. However, those aged over 70 years exhibit a trend to increasing KSI rates. Analysis of casualty rates of drivers by type of <b>junction,</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> and environmental conditions found that some gender-age groups are overrepresented in certain accident types, including over twice higher serious accidents rates for men, but over representation of older women when driving in poor conditions and turning right and negotiating roundabouts, crossroads and T, Y and staggered junctions. Improvement in engineering design and driver training are suggested together with the need for a greater understanding of the transportation system needs of old and vey old people...|$|E
40|$|Older {{drivers and}} young novice drivers have {{problems}} negotiating road junctions {{and this is}} reflected in the accident statistics for these driver populations. Explanations for problems with junction negotiation largely focus on limitations in visual information processing and observation errors associated with age and experience. Investigations of drivers viewing behaviour have used measures of fixation and gaze frequency and duration to highlight drivers information processing and search, capacity and requirements. The use of more specific measures of search strategy, such as gaze transitions, has been less common, particularly for the task of gap selection in junction negotiation. Gaze transitions provide information on the positional relationship of fixations, providing a useful tool for highlighting gaps in driver’s visual information acquisition strategies. The gaze transitions of three driver groups (young novice, young experienced and older experienced) were compared during gap selection in right turn <b>junction</b> negotiation <b>manoeuvres.</b> When scanning the junction, young experienced drivers distributed their gaze more evenly across all areas, whereas older and novice drivers made more sweeping transitions, bypassing adjacent areas. The use of a preview strategy in the decision phase was less evident in the older experienced group compared to the younger groups. It is suggested that response preparation requirements of the decision phase impact on older drivers’ ability to maintain a preview strategy. The application of results to driver training interventions and future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{computer vision system}} for an autonomous road vehicle (ARV) {{that is capable of}} negotiating complex road networks including road junctions in real time. The ultimate aim of the system is to enable the vehicle to drive automatically along a given complex road network whose geometric description is known. This computer vision system includes three main techniques which are necessary for an ARV: a) road following, b) road <b>junction</b> detection, c) <b>manoeuvring</b> at the road junction. The road following algorithm {{presents a}} method of executing a number of algorithms using different methods concurrently, fusing their outputs together into an accurate road model. A model-based object approach is used for detecting the road junctions in images. In this approach two sequence processes are performed. They are to find a boundary between the candidate road junction surface and the current road surface, and to locate the road junction surface. A multi-camera vision-based re-orientation mode was used to guide the ARV during the manoeuvring process at the road junction. In the re-orientation mode, the position of the ARV with respect to the road junction is determined by the “bootstrap ” process. The results are presented for real road stretches and intersection images and performed on the experimental autonomous road vehicle in real time...|$|R
