5|$|The Tosa-class {{ships were}} {{intended}} to be armed with a main battery of ten 45-caliber 41-centimeter guns in five twin turrets, four of which were superfiring fore and aft. Numbered one through five from front to rear, the hydraulically powered turrets had an <b>elevation</b> <b>range</b> of −2 to +35 degrees. The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute. The ships were designed to carry 90 rounds per gun, although space was available for 110.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, {{these weapons}} were {{considered}} largely obsolete. However, by this time, Japanese production capabilities had improved, and the Type 38 underwent a re-design in Japan {{to improve the}} carriage, with a corresponding increase in <b>elevation,</b> <b>range</b> and rate of fire to 10-12 rounds per minute.|$|E
25|$|Kathmandu is {{dissected}} {{by eight}} rivers, the main river of the valley, the Bagmati and its tributaries, {{of which the}} Bishnumati, Dhobi Khola, Manohara Khola, Hanumante Khola, and Tukucha Khola are predominant. The mountains from where these rivers originate are in the <b>elevation</b> <b>range</b> of , and have passes which provide access to and from Kathmandu and its valley. An ancient canal once flowed from Nagarjuna hill through Balaju to Kathmandu; this canal is now extinct.|$|E

25|$|All {{the weapons}} are {{mounted on the}} turret and are {{assisted}} by a fire control system. The fire control system allows the weapons to be used while the vehicle is moving, and in all weather conditions. The turret can be traversed 360 degrees with an <b>elevation</b> <b>range</b> of −5 to +75 degrees. The vehicle's weaponry allows it to engage targets at ranges up to 4km. Helicopters and fortifications can be engaged at ranges up to 2.5km.|$|E
25|$|The Type 1 47mm {{anti-tank}} gun was accepted into service in 1942. The design originated as an improvement to the prototype “Experimental Type 97 (1937) 47 mm {{anti-tank gun}}” (試製九七式四十七粍速射砲), which was tested between 1938 and 1939. The prototype weighed 567 kilograms with a barrel length of 2,515mm, a traverse range of ±50 degrees and an <b>elevation</b> <b>range</b> of between minus 10 and plus 20 degrees, and a muzzle velocity of 730m/s. The prototype was not accepted into service {{because it was}} considered to not have sufficient performance.|$|E
25|$|The only weapon the ATOM {{prototype}} possesses is a 57mm BM-57 automatic gun. This rifled autocannon is {{a modification}} of the Soviet 57 mm S-60, developed by the company Petrel. This high caliber autocannon has an effective range of 6km and fires {{at a rate of}} 120–140 rds/min. The turret traverses 360° across the azimuth and has an <b>elevation</b> <b>range</b> between −8° and +70°. 80–100 rounds are carried within the turret with an additional 100 stowed away. The 57mm automatic cannon provides engagement of light armoured and soft targets, ATGM crews, and even aerial targets (UAVs, precision-guided munitions, aircraft and helicopters). It takes 1–3 seconds to change the type of munition for the cannon.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} {{chosen for}} building the fortification {{was in the}} Delhi plains (with an <b>elevation</b> <b>range</b> of , hemmed by the Yamuna River {{on one side and}} the northern spur of the Aravalli range of hills on the other side. This topography of the land area with the rock exposures at the Fort’s location, with a favourable link with the northeast trending ridge and the main mosque (Jama Masjid), was visualised as an ideal setting that provided the needed protection against erosion by the Yamuna River. It was also obvious that a stream on one side and a mountain ridge on the other side of any fortification would be a formidable barrier for invaders to penetrate into Delhi, as such a setting would only force the invaders to follow the river course. Keeping these advantages in view the Salimgarh Fort was built in 1546.|$|E
