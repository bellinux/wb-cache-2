5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels {{and should not be}} {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a sustainable transport system and so must be developed as part of an integrated approach, which promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency, as well as reducing the overall energy demand and need for transport. Consideration needs to be given to the development of hybrid and <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicles,</b> public transport, and better town and rural planning.|$|E
5|$|The plug-in segment sales {{remained}} flat in 2014 with 30,390 units sold, and {{a market}} share of 1.06% of total new car sales in the country (kei cars not included). Sales totaled 24,660 units in 2015, consisting of 10,420 all-electrics and 14,190 plug-in hybrids. The {{rate of growth of}} the Japanese plug-in segment slowed down from 2013, with annual sales falling behind Europe, the U.S. and China during 2014 and 2015. The decline in plug-in car sales reflects the Japanese government and the major domestic carmakers decision to adopt and promote hydrogen <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicles</b> instead of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Traction {{control for}} the proton {{exchange}} membrane (PEM) <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> hybrid <b>vehicle</b> is studied. The traction control denotes the anti-slipping action when the vehicle meets sudden road surface friction changes. Slip ratio is utilized to analyze the slipping action, and optimum value is chosen for controlling the motor speed to prevent the slip. A one-dimensional longitudinal model of a <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicle</b> is constructed to prove the traction control effectiveness. The model includes a <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> system, a battery, an inverter and permanent synchronous motor, a bi-directional converter and a vehicle dynamics. Two three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) are utilized to generate the required power for the vehicle traction. Maximum transmissible torque estimation (MTTE) control and sliding mode control are utilized for the PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicle</b> traction control algorithms. The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed control algorithm effectively prevents vehicle slipping when a PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicle</b> meets a sudden road friction change by distributing appropriate powers between battery and <b>fuel</b> <b>cell...</b>|$|R
