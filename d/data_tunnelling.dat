40|$|Abstract The Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) {{backbone}} constitutes one of {{the major}} technological breakthroughs in modern avionic architectures.

In this paper, we propose different methods to define VL characteristics and to route VLs in the network while minimizing the maximum utilization rate of the links. The proposed methods provide the basis for a more efficient design of the VLs, and have to be completed later on by the verification of the worstcase network latencies.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a secure storage model named Peer to Cloud and Peer (P 2 CP). P 2 CP uses the cloud storage {{system as a}} backbone storage system. However, when data transmission occurs, the data nodes, cloud user, and the non-cloud user are involved to complete the transaction all together. The users, typically the client peers, can {{communicate with each other}} directly, thus bypassing servers on the cloud. Similarly, cloud servers can communicate with each other in a P 2 P mode. We also introduce a 2 ̆ 2 hierarchy security 2 ̆ 2 method to guarantee the data security in the proposed P 2 CP storage model. A key feature of our P 2 CP is that it has three data transmission tunnels: the cloud-user <b>data</b> transmission <b>tunnel,</b> the clients 2 ̆ 7 <b>data</b> transmission <b>tunnel,</b> and the common <b>data</b> transmission <b>tunnel.</b> Assuming that the P 2 CP model follows the Poisson process or Little 2 ̆ 7 s law, we not only mathematically prove that the speed of P 2 CP is generally better than that of the pure peer-to-peer (P 2 P) model, the peer to server and peer (P 2 SP) model or the pure cloud model, but also testify the results through simulations. Beyond security, we also investigate the performance of another characteristic of usability of the data storage, namely availability, where P 2 CP is more robust to the failures of peers or servers in the cloud environment...|$|R
