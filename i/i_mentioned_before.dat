500|$|Early in his YouTube career, PewDiePie used rape jokes in his videos. Criticism {{of these}} jokes stirred controversy, and in October 2012, he {{addressed}} the issue through a Tumblr post, writing, [...] "I {{just wanted to make}} clear that I'm no longer making rape jokes, as <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before</b> I'm not looking to hurt anyone and I apologise if it ever did." [...] The Globe and Mail stated [...] "unlike many young gamers, he listened when fans and critics alike pointed out their harmful nature, and resolved to stop making rape jokes." ...|$|E
500|$|After a [...] "fierce bidding war", on April 5, 2005, it was {{announced}} that Spears had signed a deal with UPN to air a reality television series documenting her relationship with Federline. The series, which would air in five episodes, was revealed to chronicle the relationship [...] "from the earliest stages of their courtship to their engagement and ultimately, their stroll down the aisle". In a statement about the series, Spears stated: [...] "From the day that Kevin and I met, there have been constant rumors and inaccurate speculation about our lives together. I feel that last year, the tabloids ran my life, and I am really excited about showing my fans what really happened, rather than all the stories, which have been misconstrued by journalists in the past. As <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> I am now going to be expressing my personal life through art".|$|E
500|$|On June 8, 2010, {{the singer}} sang the track {{with four other}} songs, [...] "Bionic", [...] "Not Myself Tonight", [...] "Beautiful" [...] and [...] "You Lost Me" [...] on The Today Show. Selected as the opener of the show, James Dinh for MTV News named it [...] "aggressive", while Erika Brooks Adickman for Idolator called the {{performance}} a [...] "hot-mess show wardrobe". On June 11, 2010, Aguilera performed [...] "Fighter", [...] "You Lost Me", [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] along with a medley of [...] "Genie in a Bottle" [...] and [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] on The Early Show. Later that year, on June 13, she performed all of her biggest hits on VH1 Storytellers, including [...] "Fighter". Before performing the song, Aguilera revealed to the crowd, [...] "When I was younger {{there were a lot}} of people, as <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> that were sort of around me for the wrong reasons. There's always a positive to those negative times because throughout it you come out so much stronger and wiser". During the Justin Timberlake & Friends benefit showheld by Justin Timberlake on October 24, 2010 in Las Vegas, NevadaAguilera was invited to perform several of her hits, including [...] "Beautiful", [...] "Fighter" [...] and [...] "Ain't No Other Man". On April 16, 2012, Aguilera performed [...] "Fighter" [...] again on the second season of US reality show The Voice, on which she is one of the judges and coaches, with her [...] "Team Xtina" [...] and Crenshaw High School choir. Jonathan Hofmann called the performance [...] "insane and bizarre as it sounds".|$|E

6000|$|... "Your servant had {{to assassinate}} two persons." [...] This <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>before.</b> Why had he to assassinate two persons,* when one was enough? If {{he had killed}} Peytel, could he not have seized and gagged his wife immediately? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then I learned that, by {{excavating}} {{in one of}} the cellars of the house, he {{and some}} companions had made their way into the vaults under the great public building <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>before.</b> The blowing up of a whole wing was a certainty as soon as the materials were ready.|$|R
2500|$|... "Well {{it varies}} {{according}} to {{the person that you}} are arguing with. Should it be a child that you are having a contretemps with, the ideal is deviation tactics. For instance Lola Lupin who <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before</b> won't eat her dinner. So what I do is say, [...] "yes it is rotten food, let us sing a song", making sure that that particular chanson has a few vowels in it that require her to open her mouth! During which I pop the spoon in and I have won the argument. However if it is an argument with a person that knows their subject what I do is nod sagely and smile superciliously, let them ramble on, and at the end I say [...] "well I'm sorry, I think you're completely wrong", turn on my heels and leave. I..." ...|$|E
2500|$|But I, though I saw {{and heard}} these things, refused {{to write for}} a long time through doubt and bad opinion and the {{diversity}} of human words, not with stubbornness but in the exercise of humility, until, laid low by the scourge of God, I fell upon a bed of sickness; then, compelled at last by many illnesses, and by the witness of a certain noble maiden of good conduct [...] and of that man whom I had secretly sought and found, as mentioned above, I set my hand to the writing. While I was doing it, I sensed, as <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> the deep profundity of scriptural exposition; and, raising myself from illness by the strength I received, I brought this work to a close – though just barely – in ten years. (...) And I spoke and wrote these things not by the invention of my heart or that of any other person, but as by the secret mysteries of God I heard and received them in the heavenly places. And again I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, 'Cry out therefore, and write thus!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Have <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> that I am {{sometimes}} a great fool? If I have not, I beg {{to mention it}} now. I burst out laughing.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{should have}} <b>mentioned</b> <b>before</b> that, {{previous}} to the vessel's departure, {{the men had}} bartered away all the clothing they could possibly spare; but now, it was resolved to be more provident.|$|R
5000|$|Palencia can {{boast of}} being one of the places where best Castilian Spanish is spoken. For this reason and the others <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> <b>I</b> think that we have a great {{potential}} to host overseas students who would like to learn Spanish. Thus, we are presently working on a project called Learn Spanish in Palencia.|$|R
6000|$|... "And there's {{just one}} more thing, Spike. I know you'll excuse my {{mentioning}} it. When we're at Dreever Castle, you will find yourself within reach of {{a good deal of}} silver and other things. Would it be too much to ask you to forget your professional instincts? <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> this <b>before</b> in a general sort of way, but this is a particular case." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are old,' {{said the}} youth, 'as <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> [...] And have grown most uncommonly fat; [...] Yet you turned a back-somersault {{in at the}} door-- [...] Pray, what is the reason of that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I reckon I {{can tell}} the colonel well enough," [...] {{answered}} Barton Brownell. [...] "For I saw Caspard often, as <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> and he never {{knew what it was}} to keep his tongue from wagging." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are old," [...] {{said the}} youth, [...] "as <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> [...] And have grown most uncommonly fat: [...] Yet you turned a back-somersault {{in at the}} door-- [...] Pray what is the reason of that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{had quite}} a sociable time up in our gallery. Our tea table {{stretched}} quite across the gallery, and we drank tea [...] "in sight of all the people." [...] By we, I mean {{a great number of}} ministers and their wives, and ladies of the Antislavery Society, besides our party, and the friends whom <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>before.</b> All seemed to be enjoying themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Karate did {{not develop}} from Buddhism or Confucianism. In {{the past the}} Shorin-ryu school and the Shorei-ryu school were brought to Okinawa from China. Both of these schools have strong points, which <b>I</b> will now <b>mention</b> <b>before</b> {{there are too many}} changes: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suddenly {{a thought}} came to me. I remembered the snake part of him. Judging from {{the ratio of}} diminution, which <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> that part, if hanging down, must reach nearly, if not quite, to the ground. By taking {{advantage}} of this means of descent I might be saved, but the feat would require dexterity and an immense amount of faith. This serpent-like portion of the animal was invisible. How could I {{know how long it}} was! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you {{had better}} go and tell the mate to bring along that stuff <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before</b> I left. You can easily carry the stuff between you. I'll build the fire and, {{with the aid of}} your son, watch the two prisoners." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My suspicions," [...] he boomed, {{towards the}} {{conclusion}} of the feast, [...] "which have, I am rejoiced to say, proved so entirely void of foundation and significance, were aroused in the first instance, as <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> by the narrative of the man Samuel Wapshott." ...|$|E
60|$|Now I come in {{the last}} place to touch {{a word or two}} of adultery, and then to draw towards a conclusion. Adultery, it hath its place in the heart, among the rest of those filthinesses <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before</b> (Mark 7:21, 22) of which sin I observe two things.|$|E
60|$|The real perfectibility of man may be illustrated, as <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> by the perfectibility of a plant. The {{object of}} the enterprising florist is, as I conceive, to unite size, symmetry, and beauty of colour. It would surely be presumptuous in the most {{successful}} improver to affirm, that he possessed a carnation in which these qualities existed in the greatest possible state of perfection. However beautiful his flower may be, other care, other soil, or other suns, might produce one still more beautiful.|$|R
30|$|As <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> {{generating}} {{software is}} an essential skill for the future generation of medical physicists for maximal productivity and to contribute to any team effort to develop better methodologies. But the ability to write software alone is not sufficient - the medical physicist needs to understand the image formation process {{so as to be}} able to interact with the data appropriately. This incorporates aspects of image processing and linear systems theory. A greater understanding of image reconstruction, an example of an inverse problem, is also highly desirable.|$|R
3000|$|Impact of vadose zone (<b>I)</b> As <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> the {{principal}} aquifer {{in the study}} area is a semi-confined aquifer where the confined part occupies about 72  % from the study area and the remaining is the unconfined part. The unsaturated zone in the confined part consists mainly of silt and clay while the main constituents of vadose zone of the unconfined part are sand and gravel. Therefore, the vadose zone of the confined and unconfined parts is rated eight and three depending on the criteria of DRASTIC model (Fig.  11 f).|$|R
60|$|I allotted {{the thin}} English stuffs, which <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> {{to make every}} one a light coat like a frock, which I judged fittest for {{the heat of the}} season, cool and loose; and ordered, that {{whenever}} they decayed, they should make more, as they thought fit. The like for pumps, shoes, stockings, and hats, &c.|$|E
60|$|Till {{this week}} the city {{continued}} free, there having never any died except that one Frenchman, who[20] <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> within the whole ninety-seven parishes. Now, there died four within the city,--one in Wood Street, one in Fenchurch Street, and two in Crooked Lane. Southwark was entirely free, having not one yet died {{on that side of}} the water.|$|E
60|$|Any {{person would}} have been {{surprised}} to have seen how we all sat staring at each other; for though it was signed by all the executors, yet {{they did not know}} the substance of it till it was publicly read, excepting the chaplain; and he, as <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> had told me the codicil had better never have been added.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{read the letter}} here," [...] Captain Clinton said. [...] "I may tell you what <b>I</b> did not <b>mention</b> <b>before,</b> {{that there was a}} strong opinion among many at the time, that the {{confusion}} between the children arose, not from accident, as was said, but was deliberate, and this letter confirms that view. This is what has hit Edgar so hard." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{for such}} footmen as thee and I are, let us never desire {{to meet with}} an enemy, nor vaunt as if we could do better, when we hear of others {{that they have been}} toiled, nor be tickled at the {{thoughts}} of our own manhood; for such commonly come by the worst when tried.[258] Witness Peter, of whom <b>I</b> made <b>mention</b> <b>before.</b> He would swagger, aye, he would; he would, as his vain mind prompted him to say, do better, and stand more for his Master than all men; but who so foiled, and run down by these villains, as he?[259] ...|$|R
60|$|As for Ben, he {{was less}} afraid of a {{whipping}} than of his father's disapprobation. Mr. Franklin, as <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> was a sagacious man, and also an inflexibly upright one. He had read much for a person in his rank of life, and had pondered upon {{the ways of the}} world, until he had gained more wisdom than a whole library of books could have taught him. Ben had a greater reverence for his father than for any other person in the world, as well on account of his spotless integrity as of his practical sense and deep views of things.|$|R

6000|$|... "At night, of course, {{the bank}} {{premises}} are barred and bolted against the street, {{and as an}} additional precaution {{there is always a}} night watchman in the office. As <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> there is only a glass door between the office and the manager's private room. This, of course, accounted {{for the fact that the}} night watchman heard all that he did hear, on that memorable night, and so helped further to entangle the thread of that impenetrable mystery.|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} endless {{to give you}} a Catalogue, and they admit of no Strangers to write any thing down, but what the Memory can retain, you are welcome to carry away with you; and amongst the {{wonderful}} Volumes of Antient and Modern Learning, I could not but take Notice of a few; which, besides those <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> I saw, when I lookt over this vast Collection; and a larger Account may be given in our next.|$|E
50|$|Ulrich's {{daughter}} Anna {{is probably}} {{the wife of the}} knight Ulrich <b>I</b> (<b>mentioned</b> from <b>before</b> 1218 to before 1224) from the highly respected family of Grünenberg. The majority of the Langenstein descendants had already founded their own families, such as the Balm family, a generation before. Therefore, Anna became the primary heiress to the Langenstein lands. With her marriage to Ulrich of Grünenberg, she brought the Langenstein lands into the Grünenberg family. Anna died seven days after the death of her husband, but not before her and her sons made a large donation to the Abbey of St. Urban.|$|R
60|$|I hadn't {{heard the}} door open, but the man was on the spot once more. My private belief, as I think <b>I</b> have <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> is that Jeeves doesn't have to open doors. He's {{like one of those}} birds in India who bung their astral bodies about--the chaps, I mean, who having gone into thin air in Bombay, {{reassemble}} the parts and appear two minutes later in Calcutta. Only some such theory will account for the fact that he's not there one moment and is there the next. He just seems to float from Spot A to Spot B like some form of gas.|$|R
60|$|But {{there is}} one thing <b>I</b> must <b>mention</b> <b>before</b> Mrs. Crocker and I leave for New York, in a shower of rice, on Mr. Cooke's own private car, and that is my client's gift. In {{addition}} to the check he gave Marian, he presented us with a huge, 'repousse' silver urn he had had made to order, and he expressed a desire that the design upon it should remind us of him forever and ever. I think it will. Mercury is duly set forth in a gorgeous equipage, driving four horses around the world at a furious pace; and the artist, by special instructions, had docked their tails.|$|R
