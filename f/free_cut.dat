He told him that she had kept her word to the last; and that, meeting even him in the streets--he had been fond of her once, it seems--she had slipped from him by a trick, and he never saw her again, until, being in one of the frequent crowds at Tyburn, with some of his rough companions, he had been driven almost mad by seeing, in the criminal under another name, whose death he had come to witness, herself. Standing in the same place in which she had stood, he told the hangman this, and told him, too, her real name, which only her own people and the gentleman for whose sake she had left them, knew.

40|$|AbstractFree-cut {{elimination}} allows cut elimination to {{be carried}} out in the presence of non-logical axioms. Formulas in a proof are anchored provided they originate in a non-logical axiom or non-logical inference. This paper corrects and strengthens earlier upper bounds on the size of free-cut elimination. The correction requires that the notion of a <b>free</b> <b>cut</b> be modified so that a cut formula is anchored provided that all of its introductions are anchored, instead of only requiring that one of its introductions is anchored. With the correction, the originally proved size upper bounds remain unchanged. These results also apply to partial cut elimination. We also apply these bounds to elimination of cuts in propositional logic. If the non-logical inferences are closed under cut and infer only atomic formulas, then all cuts can be eliminated. This extends earlier results of Takeuti and of Negri and von Plato...|$|E

40|$|Manufacturing {{of parts}} by laser cutting is widely {{accepted}} in industry. In the market there are systems which are highly focused on special applications like robot based 3 D cutting {{but there are}} also general purpose machines which cut a variety of metal sheets at different thicknesses. Most of these machines use a melt based cutting process where the material is molten and ejected by an assist gas. Quality of the laser cut part is determined by a dross <b>free</b> <b>cut</b> with minimal roughness on the cut faces after all standardized properties have to be fulfilled. To ensure this level of quality, several process parameters have to be kept at the right values and within defined tolerances. The most important one is the focal position which cannot be detected during processing. In this context, the transient behavior of the focal position due to thermal heating of optical elements is a challenging problem. In this paper, a process model is developed which allows the determination of the focal position by an experimentally accessible surrogate criterion. The theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results and a concept for an active focus control is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The acute {{impairment}} of endothelium-dependent relaxations after ischemia and acute reperfusion injury {{has been studied}} extensively. However, less {{is known about the}} chronic status of the coronary endothelium following progressive reperfusion. Experiments were designed to characterize, after 60 min of ischemia followed by progressive reperfusion, the coronary endothelial function under acute and chronic conditions. Heartworm-free mongrel dogs were used. A percutaneous balloon catheter was inflated to occlude the left anterior descending coronary artery for 60 min, followed by progressive deflation. After 60 min or 4 weeks of reperfusion, the coronary arteries were dissected <b>free,</b> <b>cut</b> into rings, suspended in organ chambers, and exposed to endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent agonists, both in the presence and absence of pertussis toxin. Left circumflex coronary arteries (from the same dogs) that had not been subjected to occlusion and reperfusion were studied in parallel as controls. The acute endothelium-dependent relaxations to serotonin, thrombin, and adenosine/diphosphate were impaired significantly following ischemia-reperfusion injury. Four weeks after ischemia-reperfusion injury, the endothelium-dependent relaxations to these substances were normal compared with those of controls. The endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine, bradykinin, and the calcium ionophore A 23187 were unaffected either acutely or chronically. An early {{impairment of}} endothelium-dependent relaxations after ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs in response to serotonin, thrombin, and adenosine diphosphate. This early impairment is transient and is not evident 4 weeks after reperfusion. In contrast to the regenerated endothelium following balloon deendothelialization, the chronic endothelial pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein function is not impaired selectively after ischemia-reperfusion injury, provided the reperfusion occurs gradually. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Manufacturing {{of parts}} by laser cutting is widely {{accepted}} in industry. In the market there are systems which are highly focused on special {{applications such as}} robot based 3 D cutting in the automotive industry but also all-round machines which cut a diverse set of sheet steels {{at a variety of}} thicknesses. Most of these machines use a melt based cutting process where the molten material is ejected by an assist gas. Quality of the laser cut part is determined by a dross <b>free</b> <b>cut</b> with minimal roughness on the cut face. To ensure this quality, several parameters of the cutting process have to be within their defined tolerances. Such parameters are the focal position, the distance of the cutting nozzle to the work piece and the beam quality to name only the most important ones. The paper reports about the approach to equip industrial laser cutting systems with sensors such that manufacturing quality comes to an advanced level. Prior work has shown that such technical systems can be enabled to determine their focal position autonomously. As a next step, active control of the laser focal position has been demonstrated keeping the process at its nominal operating point in this respect. The benefits for manufacture are discussed in relation to machine setup and sustainability. The reported system relies on expert knowledge about the system behaviour in order to reference the measurement signal to the focal position. As this behaviour is closely connected to the current state of all optical elements in the system, an inference from the current control signal to the status of the optical train of the system becomes possible...|$|E
40|$|In {{sheet metal}} forming cutting {{technologies}} {{are the most important}} procedures, because every single component has to be cut minimum once. Increasing standards in terms of safety and crash performance in the automotive industries leads to material toughness as well as more complex part geometries. Most of these parts are made by press-hardening. As a pre-process a new and innovative contact heating devise were developed. To post-process this ultra high strength steels (UHSS) common shear cutting technologies, like shearing or fine blanking, are not suitable any more. Production processes by laser trimming are still state of the art in this field of industries. But this is suboptimal in terms of time-, material- and energy-efficiency. Substitution of these laser procedures by economical cutting technologies is essential more than ever. The innovative High Speed Impact Cutting (HSIC), with cutting velocities up to 10 m/s, could be an alternative to process these UHSS. Advantages of the HSIC are the fine grained cutting surface, which can be directly used as a function surface and the oil <b>free</b> <b>cut.</b> Detailed pre-investigations to process UHSS by HSIC were made. It is shown how process parameters like die clearance, cutting velocity, suitable tool materials and design are determined. Based on this knowledge, the applicability of HSIC of directly, inline press-hardened materials is shown {{with the help of a}} crash relevant serial component of a car B-pillar. Next to an improved cutting quality, a significant shortened process time were indicated by using the new HSIC technology and machinery (laser process time: 1 : 20 min vs: HSIC process time: 20 ms) [1]. It is scientifically shown how it is possible to reach a significant increase in productivity by developing and using innovative contact heating and cutting technologies. This leads to huge saving effects in terms of energy, time as well as material...|$|E
40|$|Background: This article aims to {{describe}} histopathologic high risk tumor characteristics {{in our patient}} population of retinoblastoma. It is based on consensus criteria for definitions of choroidal and optic nerve invasion as outlined in The International RetinoblastomaStaging Working Group (IRSWG) 2009. Materials and Methods: Fifty histopathologically diagnosed cases of retinoblastoma were archived from records of Pathology department during years 2004 to 2014. Re-evaluation of slides to identify choroidal and optic nerve invasion as per IRSWG along with Pathologic tumor staging was done. Data were entered into Microsoft excel sheets and results expressed in percentages. Department of Ophthalmology was consulted for recurrence of Retinoblastoma. Results: Among fifty cases, Choroidal invasion was absent in 62 % cases. Minimal invasion ( 3 mm) in 14 % cases and extra ocular involvement in 6 % cases. The optic nerve was free of tumor {{in more than three}} forth of the cases (78 %). Prelaminar and retro laminar involvement of optic nerve was observed in 6 % and 10 % cases respectively. Intraocular spread of tumor was observed in 6 % of cases. The cut margin of optic nerve was involved in 42 % while it was free of tumor in 58 % of cases. Significant number of tumours were pathologically classified as pT 1 (58 %) followed by pT 2 a (22 %). pT 3 a and pT 4 b were found in 6 % each and pT 3 b and pT 4 a were found in 4 % each. Recurrence was observed in two cases of PT 3 a and one of pT 4 b. Conclusion: We conclude identifying low percentages of high risk charateristics in a retrospective histologic experience with Retinoblastoma. Recurrence observed in two tumours staged pT 3 a sheds light on prognostic significance of reporting massive choroidal invasion despite <b>free</b> <b>cut</b> margin. These observations call for routine practice of standardized histopathologic reporting and processing of enucleated eye samples at our tertiary care centre.
