In addition, {{there were several}} smaller {{communal}} cemeteries. [...] Funeral parlors offered seven different styles of burial, ranging in price from 18 francs to more than 7,000 francs for an elaborate individual monument. [...] Two thirds of Parisians, however, were buried in collective graves {{in a corner of}} the cemeteries, with the cost paid by the city. [...] Before Napoleon III, the corpses of indigents were simply piled into trenches in seven layers, each covered with a thin layer of earth and lime. Napoleon III had the process made somewhat more dignified, with the corpses laid side by side <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> in a trench. The city would pay for a priest who, if requested, would provide a short service and scatter holy water on the trench. Indigents who died in hospitals and those whose bodies had been dissected in medical schools continued to be buried in the more crowded trenches. [...] For all indigent burials, the bodies remained in the trenches only long enough for them to decompose, no longer than five years. After that time, all remains were dug up and transferred to an ossuary, so that the space could be used for new burials.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{numerical}} procedure is presented {{for the analysis}} of the elastic field due to <b>an</b> edge dislocation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> multilayered composite. The multilayered composite consists of n perfectly bonded layers having different material properties and thickness, and two half-planes adhere to the top and bottom layers. The stiffness matrices for each layer and the half-planes are first derived in the Fourier transform domain, then a set of global stiffness equations is assembled to solve for the transformed components of the elastic field. Since the singular part of the elastic field corresponding to the dislocation in the full-plane has been extracted from the transformed components, regular numerical integration is needed only to evaluate the inverse Fourier transform. Numerical results for the elastic field due to <b>an</b> edge dislocation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bimaterial medium are shown in fairly good agreement with analytical solutions. The elastic field and the Peach–Kohler image force are also presented for <b>an</b> edge dislocation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>layered</b> half-plane, <b>a</b> two-layered half-plane and a multilayered composite made of alternating layers of two different materials...|$|R
