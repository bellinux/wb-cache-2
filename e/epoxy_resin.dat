25|$|The {{frame was}} made by {{electroplating}} gold onto the inside of an <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> cast. B.J.S. Electroplating Co., a precious-metal electroformers, was commissioned by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to make a fibreglass-reinforced polyester mould of a wax model of the coronet that Louis Osman had made using a wooden template. From this mould a negative <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> cast was produced. B.J.S. involved Engelhard Industries {{to assist in the}} electroforming of the cast. David Mason was Head of Research at Engelhard and was assigned the task of doing the electroforming at the company's headquarters in the Forest of Dean.

50|$|Liquid <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> {{in their}} uncured state are mostly classed as {{irritant}} {{to the eyes}} and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> are generally safer than liquid <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins,</b> and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> is sensitization. The risk {{has been shown to}} be more pronounced in <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents. Exposure to <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> can, over time, induce an allergic reaction. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of dermatitis, particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms). Epoxy use is a main source of occupational asthma among users of plastics. Bisphenol A, which is used to manufacture a common class of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins,</b> is a known endocrine disruptor.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} made to {{determine}} {{the advantages of the}} use of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> in the industrial arts laboratory. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the feasibility of using <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> as a wood adhesive. Data was gathered from texts, periodicals, and unpublished data. Tests were conducted using epoxy samples acquired from three epoxy manufacturers on three different woods and joints. The study discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> as a wood adhesive and the material and equipment necessary for the use of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins.</b> Strength tests were performed on the joints adhered with epoxy and on joints adhered with white glue. A hand operated high tensile strength machine was used to conduct the tests. <b>Epoxy</b> <b>Resins</b> were found, in most cases, to give a more durable bond than white glue.

40|$|Epoxy prepolymers were {{synthesized}} from alcoholysis lignin (AL) and lignin-related phenols such as p-hydroquinone (HQ) and methoxy-p-hydroquinone (MHQ) by reaction with epichlorohydrin. <b>Epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> were synthesized {{from the}} above prepolymers by reaction with poly(azelaic anhydride). The molar ratios of acid anhydride groups to epoxy groups ([AA/EPOXY] ratios) were varied at 10 / 10 and 12 / 10. The thermal properties of the obtained prepolymers and <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry (TG) and TG- Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

25|$|A further {{impediment}} to {{reliability of the}} early devices was the diffusion of water vapour from the body fluids through the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> encapsulation affecting the electronic circuitry. This phenomenon was overcome by encasing the pacemaker generator in a hermetically sealed metal case, initially by Telectronics of Australia in 1969 followed by Cardiac Pacemakers Inc of Minneapolis in 1972. This technology, using titanium as the encasing metal, became the standard by the mid-1970s.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{biodegradability}} of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> and bisphenol A. Biodegradability depends on the selected microorganism and its enzymes. The experiments were carried out with the fungi Trametes versicolor. The background {{of this study is}} the biodegradability of carbon fiber reinforced plastics. Carbon fiber reinforced plastics consist mostly of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> and carbon fibers. The most used reactant of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> is bisphenol A. <b>Epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> draw an analogy to the biopolymer lignin. For that reason the ligninolytic enzymes laccase and manganese peroxidase were used in this study. These enzymes can be produced by the microorganism Trametes versicolor. The degradations of bisphenol A and the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> were analyzed. Araldite and Poly(bisphenol A- co-epichlorohydrin) served as <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins.</b> The paper answers the question if the selected ligninolytic enzymes are able to degrade <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> and bisphenol A. It also {{deals with the}} question if Trametes versicolor is able to degrade bisphenol A. To proof the degradation two analytical methods have been selected. The utilized methods for detection are high performance liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography. The analyses show, that bisphenol A, Araldite and Poly(bisphenol A- co-epichlorohydrin) can be broken by the enzyme laccase. There is no biodegradation by the enzyme manganese peroxidase. The fungi Trametes versicolor is able to produce the enzyme laccase in the presence of bisphenol A. The production of laccase was proofed by a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. There was also a decrease in the concentration of bisphenol A...|$|R

The initial production stages repeated the Hoerni's planar process. Then the 80-micron-thick crystal was glued, face down, to the glass substrate, and additional photolithography was carried on the back surface. Deep etching created a groove down to the front surface. Then the back surface was covered with an <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin,</b> and the chip was separated from the glass substrate.|$|E

First, a protection and support bandage of cotton gauze and polyvinyl alcohol is applied. Difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized vacuuming. The other areas that are easier to remove (because they had been damaged by less water) are removed with a paper pulp compress saturated with bicarbonate of ammonia solutions and removed with deionized water. These sections are strengthened and reattached then cleansed with base exchange resin compresses and the wall and pictorial layer were strengthened with barium hydrate.

25|$|Modern dory {{designers}} include Phil Bolger of Gloucester and John Welsford of New Zealand. Most modern dories {{are about}} 15–16 feet long, built of lightweight plywood, fastened by fibreglass tape and <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin.</b> They are much lighter than traditional dories and {{compensate for the}} lack of initial stability by having slightly wider bottoms and very low (8inch high) seats and are fitted with skegs for directional stability. Welsford recommends the carrying of a water container on a rope that can be thrown to either the bow or stern to adjust trim in different sea conditions. Unlike a conventional wide bottom dinghy it is dangerous to sit or stand in the extreme ends due to the minimal displacement. Modern designs, like their traditional counterparts, gain significant stability when heavily laden amidships.|$|E
25|$|The Fender Jazz bass guitar {{started out}} {{life as a}} {{standard}} 4-string bass, but in 1976, after being inspired by Jaco Pastorius' fretless playing, he commissioned a symphony bass repairman {{by the name of}} Neville Whitehead to replace the standard neck with a fretless version. The replacement neck was a planed-down real ebony neck removed from a 100-year-old upright bass. For six months Foster struggled with the pure black neck as there were no indicators for finger positioning. Eventually giving up the fight, he employed luthier Dick Knight to mark fretlines on the neck. After going to this trouble he was surprised to learn that Pastorius achieved the same thing by merely pulling off the frets and filling the resulting holes with <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin.</b> Since the early 80s the bass guitar has undergone several component replacements including the bridge and the pick-ups.|$|E
25|$|Film {{capacitors}} for use {{in electronic}} equipment are packaged in the common and usual industry styles: axial, radial, and SMD. Traditional axial type packages are less used today, but are still specified for point-to-point wiring and some traditional through-hole printed circuit boards. The most common form factor is the radial type (single ended), with both terminals {{on one side of}} the capacitor body. To facilitate automated insertion, radial plastic film capacitors are commonly constructed with terminal spacings at standardized distances, starting with 2.5mm pitch and increasing in 2.5mm steps. Radial capacitors are available potted in plastic cases, or dipped in an <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> to protect the capacitor body against environmental influences. Although the transient heat of reflow soldering induces high stress in the plastic film materials, film capacitors able to withstand such temperatures are available in Surface Mounted Device“ (SMD) packages.|$|E
