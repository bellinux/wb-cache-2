40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) A {{great deal}} of {{research}} indicates that over 100 million children worldwide are marginalised from education, including about 40 million with some form of disability living in the Asia Pacific region. In countries {{with high levels of}} human poverty and low national human development, education is an important vehicle to employment, independence, and social and political empowerment. <b>For</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> education holds the potential to transform experiences of deprivation into opportunities for greater personal freedom and family and community respect and belonging. East Asia and Pacific studies have linked low school attendance rates <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in such island nations as Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste with traditional beliefs about the causes of disability and family shame. This study sought to reveal and understand the complexities of education provision in Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste, with a view to offering recommendations for growth in Timor-Leste’s system of education <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> In both countries, approximately 99 % of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> are excluded from the education system. Prior studies have shed light on the impact of such diseases as malaria, chronic malnutrition, and an inadequate health system on survival rates <b>for</b> young <b>children.</b> Many of these studies also highlight the challenges of providing quality education in overcrowded classrooms with limited educational resources and professional training in disability-inclusive teaching methods. Papua New Guinea’s education system was chosen for intensive study as, despite the complex human development challenges facing the country, the government had transformed its segregated education system <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> into an inclusive system <b>for</b> all <b>children.</b> The researcher sought to gain historical and current perspectives on the transformation process, and identify features of the inclusive education system that may have relevance and application <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in Timor-Leste. The research approach employed in this study included collection and analysis of the professional and personal perspectives of 32 education and rehabilitation leaders and practitioners working in Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste, and has been supported by analysis of documentary data in related fields of study. Research methods included case study interviews in Papua New Guinea, establishment of a Timor-Leste reference group of educational leaders, and development of an analysis model to guide data coding, analysis, interpretation, and display. One of the most important discoveries made {{during the course of this}} study was the limited impact of the 20 years of educational reform in Papua New Guinea on enrolment rates <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> This discovery resulted in an emphasis on transformative human rights and empowerment perspectives in the study’s conclusions and recommendations. The recommendations offered promote transformation of educational marginalisation and disadvantage <b>for</b> Timor-Leste’s <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> through government and civil society partnerships that promote and support equitable participation of people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in educational leadership, governance, and infrastructure development at all levels of the education system...|$|R

40|$|Today, because gender-blind {{education}} and sexuality education have been criticized, and now, {{we are currently}} in {{a situation in which}} we cannot conduct enough of them. There are few opportunities <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> to acquire the right knowledge for establishing their sexual independence, therefore sexuality education at schools plays an important role. In particular, because it is difficult <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> visual <b>disabilities</b> to access visual information, the knowledge they can acquire by themselves is extremely limited. Moreover, for people <b>with</b> visual <b>disabilities,</b> “touch” is an essential means of acquiring information about an object. The sense of touch plays considerably important role in the study of each subject. Therefore, in this paper, I investigated how we can use the sense of touch in sexuality education <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> visual <b>disabilities...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Grievers {{can make}} meaning of death through philanthropic {{services}} such as charities, foundations, and organizations. Meaning-making through philanthropy can create financial support, social support, emotional support, and helps create positive results from the negative experience of the death. For example, one couple that lost a child described how they developed [...] "Nora's Project" [...] after their daughter with a disability died, {{in order to help}} provide wheelchairs <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> around the world. The mother said: [...] "With Nora's Project, I am also healing. I am able to turn something that was horrific, the way she died, into something that will do good in the world". Like this mother, it is common for individuals to want to create or do something positive for others. Philanthropy helps people make meaning by continuously and altruistically honoring a life while simultaneously helping others going through a similar experience.|$|E

The Act mandated that all children with disabilities receive a [...] "free appropriate public education." [...] To achieve this goal, the act required the student, parents and teachers together devise an Individualized Education Program (IEP), however the Act did not specify that those IEPs include any particular services, standards or outcomes.|$|E
