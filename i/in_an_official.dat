5|$|Matejko began {{collecting}} {{materials for the}} painting in 1874. He started painting the canvas some time in 1875 and finished it in 1878. Soon afterwards, he received a scepter from the council of Kraków <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> ceremony, in recognition of his work and his position {{as one of the}} most respected Polish artists. The painting was sold that year to Dawid Rosenblum, a private individual in Warsaw. Displayed in numerous international exhibitions, in 1902 the painting was bought from Rosenblum's heirs by the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts (Towarzystwo Zachęty Sztuk Pięknych) and displayed in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Dread was a 2D side-scrolling action-adventure {{video game}} by Nintendo, {{intended}} for release on the Nintendo DS handheld game console.

It was first seen <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> internal software list made by Nintendo in 2005 and a reveal at the Electronic Entertainment Expo convention in 2005 and 2006 was anticipated; it was not revealed in either year, and is the only title to date on the list that has not been revealed.|$|E

5|$|Octavian {{betrayed his}} party, {{and came to}} terms with Caesarians Antony and Lepidus and on 26 November 43 BC the Second Triumvirate was formed, this time <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> capacity.

Although Brutus {{defeated}} Octavian, Antony defeated Cassius, who committed suicide. Brutus also committed suicide shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Preoccupied with {{military}} matters and {{spending most of}} his time at his military headquarters on the eastern front, Hitler came to rely more and more on Bormann to handle the domestic policies of the country. On 12 April 1943, Hitler officially appointed Bormann as Personal Secretary to the Führer. By this time Bormann had de facto control over all domestic matters, and this new appointment gave him the power to act <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> capacity in any matter.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Standard of Scotland, {{also known}} as the Banner of the King of Scots or more {{commonly}} the Lion Rampant of Scotland, is the Scottish Royal Banner of Arms. Used historically by the King of Scots, the Royal Standard of Scotland differs from Scotland's national flag, The Saltire, in that its correct use is restricted by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland to only a few Great Officers of State who officially represent The Sovereign in Scotland. It is also used <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> capacity at Royal residences in Scotland when the Sovereign is not present.|$|E

5|$|The {{release for}} the film was {{originally}} planned for 2007, then 2008 and 2009, before its 2010 release. Clips of the film were shown at Wikimania 2007 in Taipei prior to its completion. Editors in the audience had mixed views on the film. In 2008, footage from the film was used <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> fundraising video by the Wikimedia Foundation. The film had its premiere at Wikimania 2010 in Gdańsk in July 2010, before an audience of approximately 300 people. A trailer for the movie was released in October 2010.|$|E
5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, if {{they have}} any {{validity}} at all, may represent the official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. In reality, the slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only about two-thirds of official. Thus Agathias' 600,000 on paper may have been no more than c. 400,000 in reality. The latter figure accords well with the other global figure from ancient sources, by the 6th-century writer John Lydus, of 389,704 (excluding fleets) for the army of Diocletian. Lydus' figure is accorded greater credibility than Agathias' by scholars because of its precision (implying that it was found <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> document) {{and the fact that it}} is ascribed to a specific time period.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Nagle had a Pomeranian and a Bulldog, but {{was promised}} {{she could have}} a larger dog once her {{schooling}} was completed. In 1913 her dream came to fruition with the purchase of her first Irish Wolfhound, Manin Michael, for £5. James Nagle subsequently registered the dog with the Kennel Club, before it {{was transferred to the}} ownership of Mr and Mrs Nagle, and its name changed to Sir Michael of Sheppey in May 1917. Food shortages during the First World War resulted <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> prohibition on dog breeding, but Nagle ignored it and bred her first litter from a bitch called Lady Alma of Sheppey.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Presiding Officer is {{responsible}} for ensuring that the Parliament functions effectively and has the staff, property and resources it requires to operate. Convening the Parliamentary Bureau, which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber, is another of the roles of the Presiding Officer. Under the Standing Orders of the Parliament the Bureau consists of the Presiding Officer and one representative from each political party with five or more seats in the Parliament. Amongst the duties of the Bureau are to agree the timetable of business in the chamber, establish the number, remit and membership of parliamentary committees and regulate the passage of legislation (bills) through the Parliament. The Presiding Officer also represents the Scottish Parliament at home and abroad <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> capacity.|$|E
5|$|As expected, the Australian team's leaders Ian Johnson and Keith Miller, {{retired from}} cricket after the tour. Harvey {{replaced}} Johnson as Victorian captain {{and was the}} logical choice as successor to the Test captaincy, as the most experienced {{member of the team}} (48 Tests). Queensland's captain, the veteran paceman Ray Lindwall, was no longer an automatic Test selection. However, both Harvey and Benaud had been criticised for their attitude towards Johnson <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> report to the board about the 1956 tour. Harvey was surprisingly overlooked for the captaincy, which went to Ian Craig, who had replaced Miller as New South Wales skipper. Craig was only 22 and had played six Tests; he had yet to establish himself in the team. After several disappointing results against England, the selectors chose a youthful team. Harvey was named vice-captain to Craig for both the 1956–57 non-Test tour of New Zealand and the 1957–58 Test tour to South Africa.|$|E

5|$|During the Ottoman period, al-Azhar regained {{its status}} as a favored {{institution}} of learning in Egypt, overtaking the madrasas that had been originally instituted by Saladin and greatly expanded by the Mamluks. By the end of the 18th century, al-Azhar had become inextricably linked to the ulema of Egypt. The ulema also were able to influence the government <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> capacity, with several sheikhs appointed to advisory councils that reported to the pasha (honorary governor), who in turn was appointed for only one year. This period also saw the introduction of more secular courses taught at al-Azhar, with science and logic joining philosophy in the curriculum. During this period, al-Azhar saw its first non-Maliki rector; Abdullah al-Shubrawi, a follower of the Shafii madhab, was appointed rector. No follower of the Maliki madhab would serve as rector until 1899 when Salim al-Bishri was appointed to the post.|$|E
5|$|However, for {{regulatory}} reasons, {{the number}} was reissued on blue shirts 2004 to 2006 Serie C1, a tournament where there is the old numbering from 1 to 11. The last player to wear and score goals with this shirt <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> match was Mariano Bogliacino in the home match of 18 May 2006 against Spezia, valid for the final leg of the Supercoppa di Lega Serie C1; primacy belongs to him also for last appearance in the championship, 12 May 2006 at the home match against Lanciano. As regards exclusively the championship, however, the honour goes to the Argentine footballer Roberto Sosa, {{the distinction of being}} the last to wear the 10 at the San Paolo {{and at the same time}} to score in the match against Frosinone on 30 April 2006.|$|E
5|$|In his {{civilian}} life, Harvey pursued {{political interests}} and spent three spells as a Member of Parliament for Maldon and later Essex. During this period {{he was also}} knighted. However, Harvey was not a peaceable man and his life {{both in and out}} of the Navy was frequently punctuated by disputes with fellow officers and politicians. One such dispute, a consequence of the Battle of Basque Roads, eventually cost Harvey his career; a bitter exchange with Lord Gambier forcing Harvey into early retirement in 1809. Although reinstated a year later, Harvey was never again employed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>official</b> capacity and further promotions were only bestowed as a matter of seniority.|$|E
