500|$|Minh instead {{arrived to}} find that the {{brothers}} were not in the palace. In anticipation of a coup, they had ordered the construction of three separate tunnels leading from Gia Long to remote areas outside the palace. Around 20:00 {{on the night of the}} coup, with only the Presidential Guard to defend them against mutinous infantry and armor units, Diệm and Nhu hurriedly packed American banknotes into a briefcase. They escaped through one of the tunnels with two loyalists: Air Force Lieutenant Ðỗ Thơ, Diệm's aide-de-camp, who happened to be a nephew of Colonel Đỗ Mậu, the director of military security and a participant in the coup plot, and Xuân Vy, head of Nhu's Republican Youth. After the coup, General Paul Harkins, the head of the US presence in Vietnam, inspected the tunnel and noted that it [...] "was so far down that I didn't want to go down to walk up the thing". The brothers emerged in a wooded area in a park near the Cercle Sportif, the city's upper class sporting club, where they were picked up by a waiting Land Rover. Ellen Hammer disputes the tunnel escape, asserting that the Ngo brothers simply walked out of the building, which was not yet under siege. Hammer asserts that they walked past the tennis courts and left the palace grounds through a small gate at Le Thanh Ton Street and entered the car. The loyalists traveled through narrow back streets in order to evade rebel checkpoints and changed vehicles to a black Citroën sedan. After leaving the palace, Nhu was reported to have suggested to Diệm that the brothers split up, arguing that this would enhance their chances of survival. Nhu proposed that one of them travel to the Mekong Delta to join Cao's IV Corps, while the other would travel to the II Corps of General Nguyễn Khánh in the Central Highlands. Nhu felt the rebel generals would not dare to kill one of them while the other was free, in case the surviving brother were to regain power. According to one account, Diệm was reported to have turned down Nhu, reasoning that [...] "You cannot leave alone. They hate you too much; they will kill you. Stay with me and I will protect you." [...] Another story holds that Diệm said [...] "We have always been together during these last years. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> separate during these last years? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> separate in this critical hour?" [...] Nhu agreed to remain with his brother.|$|E

He has adhered to history where he could discover any facts adapted to his purpose; and when history failed him, he has had resource to probability." [...] Ferriar continued with an attack on the Welsh names that appear within the poem: [...] "we own that the nomenclature of his heroes has shocked what Mr. S. would call our prejudices. Georvyl and Rird and Rodri and Llaian may have charms for Cambrian ears, but who can feel an interest in Tezozomoc, Tlalala, or Ocelopan [...] <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> swallow Yuhidthiton, Coanocotzin, and, above all, the yawnings jaw-dislocating Ayayaca?—These torturing words, particularly the latter, remind us so strongly of the odious cacophony of the Nurse and Child, that they really are not to be tolerated." ...|$|E

500|$|Several of the book's episodes {{have drawn}} {{attention}} for the insight they offer into the culture, structure and conflicts of traditional society before 1900. Commenting on this characteristic, Djuvara asserted: [...] "even {{if we take}} into account that the grown-up will embellish, transfigure, 'enrich' the memories of his childhood, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> not recognize the sincerity in Creangă's heart-warming evocation of his childhood's village?" [...] The book stays true to life in depicting ancient customs: discussing the impact of paganism on traditional Romanian customs, Marcu Beza communicated a detail of Creangă's account, which shows how January 1 celebrations of Saint Basil opposed the loud buhai players reenacting a fertility rite to people preferring a quieter celebration. The work also offers details on the traditional roles of a rural society such as that of Humulești, in the context of social change. Muguraș Constantinescu highlights the important roles of old men and women within Nică's universe, and especially that of his grandfather and [...] "clan leader" [...] David Creangă. The latter, she notes, is an [...] "enlightened man" [...] displaying [...] "the wisdom and balance of the ripe age", a person able to insist on the importance of education, and a churchgoer who frowns on [...] "his wife's bigotry." [...] The seniors' regulatory role within the village is evidenced throughout the book, notoriously so in the episode where the boy captures a hoopoe who bothers his morning sleep, only to be tricked into releasing it by old man, who understands the bird's vital role as village alarm clock.|$|E

2500|$|A {{significant}} contribution to philosophy of language is Russell's theory of descriptions, set out in On Denoting (Mind, 1905). Frank P. Ramsey described this paper as [...] "a paradigm of philosophy." [...] The theory considers the sentence [...] "The present King of France is bald" [...] and whether the proposition is false or meaningless. Frege had argued, employing his distinction between sense and reference, that such sentences were meaningful but neither true nor false. [...] Russell argues that the grammatical form of the sentence disguises its underlying logical form. [...] Russell's Theory of Definite Descriptions enables the sentence to be construed as meaningful but false, without commitment {{to the existence of}} any present King of France. This addresses a paradox of great antiquity (e.g. [...] "That which is not must in some sense be. Otherwise, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> say of it that it is not?" [...] etc.), going back {{at least as far as}} Parmenides.

2500|$|Creangă's {{portrayal}} of the childhood universe as a timeless reality, like his emphasis on tradition, relate to the characteristics of his native village and surrounding region. In Norman Manea's view, the [...] "perfectly recognizable" [...] narrative setting points to [...] "repetitive cycles". Focusing on the description of Humulești found in the opening lines, historian Neagu Djuvara commented: [...] "even if we {{take into account that}} the grown-up will embellish, transfigure, 'enrich' the memories of his childhood, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> not recognize the sincerity in Creangă's heart-warming evocation of his childhood's village?" [...] Djuvara used the fragment to discuss the structure of Romanian rural society in Moldavia, made relatively wealthy by textile enterprises, in comparison to its counterpart in the southern region of Wallachia, concluding: [...] "if the mud hut villages of the Danube flood plain are to be taken into account, one finds himself in a different country." [...] Folklorist and critic Marcu Berza took the book as a record of Romanian folklore, its varieties and its reception, noting that the episode in which buhai players are chased away by angered householders shows that some peasants preferred a quieter celebration to what was in effect an echo of pagan fertility rites.|$|E

[...] By the time the picture was released, Chandler was thoroughly disillusioned with the writers' lot in Hollywood; he published an angry piece titled [...] "Writers in Hollywood" [...] for The Atlantic Monthly in November 1945 in which he complained: [...] "The first picture I worked on was nominated for an Academy Award (if that means anything), but I was not even invited to the press review held right in the studio." [...] He neglected, however, to mention that the studio had kept him on salary during the eight-week shooting schedule and that no changes to the script were allowed without his approval – a very rare accommodation for screenwriters, particularly newcomers, in those days. Offended, Wilder responded by saying, [...] "We didn't invite him? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>we?</b> He was under the table drunk at Lucy's," [...] a nearby watering hole for Paramount employees. This relationship with Chandler is what drew Wilder to his next project, the Best Picture-winning The Lost Weekend, about an alcoholic writer.
