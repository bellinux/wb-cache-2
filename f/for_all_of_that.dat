500|$|Faye and Joseph became {{engaged in}} series ten, much to Jac's displeasure. Roberts has relayed Marcel's insight that, [...] "Jac's left with very little. She hasn't got the {{consultancy}} post. Joseph's father {{is long gone}} and I think she may be nostalgic <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> She's hankering after Joseph again. She wants him for herself." [...] He added, on Joseph's reaction to Jac's meddling in his relationship with Faye; [...] "He's a good guy but Jac brings out the evil in him. He does have a darker side. He will fight injustice with injustice." [...] In the episode [...] "Locked Away", Joseph and Jac are locked in theatre together– after being affected by an unknown poison– where they both reveal their true feelings for each other. Joseph admits that he still loves Jac, but would not take her back as she has hurt him too many times.|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an {{excellent}} review, {{giving it a}} A. In her recap, she gave the performances high marks: [...] "Fortunately, “Birth” was magnificent enough to almost make up <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> We finally learn Emma’s secret plan, and it’s amazing: She had to turn Hook into another Dark One to save his life. In all the likely speculative scenarios, I sincerely doubt anyone saw that coming. So sure, Emma’s plan is a bit dastardly now: To have Zelena absorb all of the dark magic, then kill her, but hey, she’s the (a) Dark One! Of course her plan {{has to be a}} bit menacing." ...|$|E
2500|$|None of {{the down}} {{platform}} buildings were in use, the waiting rooms (including the ladies toilet) were still let to a Scarborough school. [...] The Gents was only (just) fit for staff use. [...] On the Up platform the signal box {{was still a}} shell and the wooden floor in the booking office had collapsed. The original awning over the booking window had been demolished as unsafe, but measurements of the surviving components were taken and a sketch drawing produced. [...] The brick waiting shed had lost its window frames and the massive beam supporting the brickwork over the entrance was suffering from terminal rot. [...] A start had been made on recovering the platform gardens but they still suffered the depredations of the moorland sheep {{who had not yet}} learnt that the railway was back in business and not just additional grazing. [...] But <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> Levisham Station was open again and the serious work of renovation and restoration was under way.|$|E

40|$|Why is {{deciding}} simulation preorder (and simulation equivalence) computationally {{harder than}} deciding bisimulation equivalence on almost <b>all</b> known classes <b>of</b> processes? We {{try to answer}} this question by describing two general methods {{that can be used to}} construct direct one-to-one polynomial-time reductions from bisimulation equivalence to simulation preorder (and simulation equivalence). These methods can be applied to many classes of finitely generated transition systems, provided that they satisfy certain abstractly formulated conditions. Roughly speaking, our first method works <b>for</b> <b>all</b> classes <b>of</b> systems <b>that</b> can test for `non-enabledness' of actions, while our second method works <b>for</b> <b>all</b> classes <b>of</b> systems <b>that</b> are closed under synchronization...|$|R

His blue eyes, small and pinched close to ether, were likewise red, at least in the whites of them; and his skin, of the sort that goes with such types, was red and freckled.

25|$|Once a {{panel of}} {{associated}} genetic markers have been established for a particular disease {{it can be used}} <b>for</b> <b>all</b> carriers <b>of</b> <b>that</b> disease. In contrast, since even a monogenic disease can be caused by many different mutations within the affected gene, conventional PGD methods based on finding a specific mutation would require mutation-speciﬁc tests.

60|$|But {{the men in}} {{the line}} were not all of this calibre. Some were poor, wretched beasts, inarticulate and callous, but <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> in many ways very human. I {{remember}} a carter, evidently returning home after the day's work, stopping his cart before us so that his young hopeful, who had run to meet him, could climb in. But the cart was big, the young hopeful little, and he failed in his several attempts to swarm up. Whereupon one of the most degraded-looking men stepped out of the line and hoisted him in. Now the virtue and the joy of this act lies in that it was service of love, not hire. The carter was poor, and the man knew it; and the man was standing in the spike line, and the carter knew it; and the man had done the little act, and the carter had thanked him, even as you and I would have done and thanked.|$|E
