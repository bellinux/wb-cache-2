5000|$|The {{capacitive}} stylus pickup {{system which}} gives the CED its name can be contrasted with the technology of the conventional phonograph. Whereas the phonograph stylus physically vibrates with the variations in the record groove, and those vibrations are converted by a mechanical transducer (the phono pickup) to an electrical signal, the CED stylus normally does not vibrate and moves only to track the CED groove (and the disc surface—out-of-plane), while the signal from the stylus is natively obtained as an electrical signal. This more sophisticated system, combined with a <b>high</b> <b>revolution</b> rate, is necessary to enable the encoding of video signals with bandwidth of a few megahertz, compared {{to a maximum of}} 20 kilohertz for an audio-only signal—a difference of two orders of magnitude. Also, while the undulations {{in the bottom of the}} groove may be likened to pits, it is important to note that the spacing of vertical wave crests and troughs in a CED groove is continuously variable, as the CED is an analog medium. Usually, the term [...] "pits," [...] when used in the context of information media, refers to features with sharply defined edges and discrete lengths and depths, such as the pits on digital optical media such as CDs and DVDs.|$|E

On the one hand for many applications a high stiffness is necessary {{on the other hand}} a high rotation speed is needed. Conventional spindle bearings can not cope with both requirements at the same time. In this essay a new approach is presented that tries to solve these oppositional ambitions. The form of the bearing groove is modified in a way that causes the osculation in the contact point to decrease with increasing rotational speed caused by the displacement of the balls.

If the desired quality of the wood-based panel can be achieved at a slower speed then there is no need to use the engine and the cutters at higher speeds.

The target of the proposed reuse fabrication method is to replace the current approach, which uses strong acid and grinding and may damage the physical structure of silicon wafers and pollute to the environment. A precisely engineered clean production approach to removal of surface microstructure layers from silicon wafers is to develop a mass production system for recycling defective or discarded silicon wafers of solar cells that can reduce pollution and cost.
