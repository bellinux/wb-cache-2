40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of Metsuke on judo {{throwing}} techniques. Metsuke is a term in Budo, which means how to pay attention to the opponent. Two kinds of Metsuke were employed in the experiments. One of the Metsuke was to pay attention to the whole of the opponent putting the center of the view to the opponent 2 ̆ 7 s chest, and the other was to pay close attention to the opponent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot.</b> Speed and sense of the throwing techniques were analyzed between the two Metsuke.

Five-point rating scales evaluated sense of the throwing techniques, which was strength and uncomfortable feeling. Participants were skillful judo players who participated in the national collegiate judo championships. The results demonstrated that two kinds of Metsuke influenced the sense and did not influence the speed of the throwing techniques in skillful judo players. Participants felt stronger and smoother throwing when they used Metsuke paying attention to the whole of the opponent than to the opponent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot.</b> The findings imply that Metsuke instruction influences skill improvement of throwing techniques...|$|R

The footpads follow the prerecorded motion of the feet of healthy individuals. For gait training, the patient progresses sequentially through successively more advanced modes. In this study, two modes, the enforced climbing of stairs and interactive climbing of stairs, were developed. In the interactive mode, foot pressure sensors are used to realize interactive walking.

40|$|The ankle foot {{orthotic}} (AFO) {{has been around}} for centuries. They were created to augment functionality of an ankle damaged due to injury or disease. A common reason a patient might be prescribed an AFO is a condition called foot drop. Foot drop can be caused by many conditions, but the most common reason is a stroke. Foot drop can be characterized by the inability to raise and/or lower a patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot.</b> This incapacitation of the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot</b> leads to unnatural gaits and joint fatigue, as well as increasing the patient 2 ̆ 7 s likelihood of tripping and becoming seriously injured. Hard plastic AFOs that hold a patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot</b> in a neutral position are the current standard for combating foot drop. These AFOs come in many different shapes and sizes, which emphasizes the wide variety in functionality of someone with foot drop. Unfortunately, the restrictive nature of the AFO can cause unnatural movements in the patient 2 ̆ 7 s foot; these unnatural tendencies are more exaggerated when walking down stairs and ramps, as the natural gait is to land toe first, the opposite of what the brace allows the patient to do. The purpose of this project is to create a sensor system for an AFO to help identify varying terrain. In the future this information can then be made to control an active AFO. Each terrain type will be first measured by a pair of simple infrared range finder, attached on the lower leg, one range finder looks ahead of the user and the other looks straight down at the ground. Models for the ground conditions can be established by representing each with Fourier series created using RANdom Sample Consensus (RANSAC). RANSAC coefficients will be scaled off the rate of data coming in and gait speed. Each model has a period term so the data can easily be scaled to match the pattern of walking regardless of pace. Gait speed will be measured using the downward facing ankle-mounted rangefinder, but with a threshold to determine when the foot is in contact with the ground. Once this initial set-up is completed, the system can take in data live and provide a prediction of the type of ground the patient is walking over, using pattern recognition techniques. The hope for this project is that if the system can accurately predict the change in ground type from, for example, level walking to walking down a ramp, an AFO could then be made to adjust itself, giving the patient a more natural gait, even when encountering adverse conditions. A byproduct of constantly using a patient 2 ̆ 7 s own gait to measure ground type is the ability to track a patient 2 ̆ 7 s changing gait over time, giving therapists a valuable new tool for tracking progress in a patient...|$|R

40|$|Leg-hold traps are an {{important}} tool in selectively capturing coyotes (Canis latrans) causing agricultural depredations. Because animals captured in leg-hold traps may incur injury and trauma {{to their feet and}} legs, there has been growing opposition to use of such traps. Each year, state or federal legislation is proposed to restrict the use of traps and considerable research effort has been devoted to the examination of trap improvements or alternatives. A variety of trap modifications have been suggested to reduce foot injuries and make the technique more generally acceptable, including use of padded jaws (Linhart et al. 1986, Olsen et al. 1986, Linhart et al. 1988) or attachment of tranquilizer tabs to traps (Balser 1965, Linhart et al. 1981).

40|$|Geckos have {{extraordinary}} wall-climbing ability {{because of}} the millions of hairs with micro/nano fibrillar structures on their feet. Mimicking gecko 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>feet</b> is of scientific and engineering importance for development of physical adhesion materials and devices. The design of gecko-inspired physical adhesives seems to be geometry dominated. In this study, Finite Element Method (FEM) has been used to analyse the vertical peel-off force of polyporpylene (PP) nanofibres having different fibre dimensions, inclining angels and contact areas on a flat glass substrate. It has been found that the main parameters affecting the frictional adhesion are fibre diameter and fibre aspect ratio, the inclining angle between the fibre and the substrate surface, and the intimate contact areas. Our analysis has shown that PP nanofibres with a diameter of less than 200 nm can generate less peel-off force than fibres of larger diameters, indicating more stable adhesion with the glass substrate for thinner fibres. A bent fibre with more intimate contact area can bear more shear force than a straight fibre with less contact area. Also, under the same shear loading, fibres with an inclining angle of less than 30 ° provide a low peel off force. </p...|$|R

However, these forces are considerably weakened in a wet physiological environment. To circumvent this loss in force, current biocompatible adhesives with nanopillars require complex multiple-step fabrication, including an extra layer of adhesive coating to stabilize tissue bonding under physiological conditions. In this report, we describe a simple one-step fabrication process of a single-layer chitosan film that has pillars with base diameter in the range of 100 - 600 [*]nm and a height of 70 [*]nm. The nanostructured adhesive is laser-bonded to tissue and does not require pillar coating to enhance bonding in water. In comparison with a 2 ̆ 7 flat 2 ̆ 7 adhesive (without pillars), the nanostructured adhesive bonded significantly stronger to tissue under either stress or pressure.
