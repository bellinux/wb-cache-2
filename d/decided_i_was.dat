Years later he recalled, [...] "That winter was when I really started working out. I started running more. I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really {{going to find out}} how good I can be." [...] During spring training, Dodger scout Kenny Myers discovered a hitch in Koufax's windup: he'd rear back so far that his vision was obstructed and he couldn't see the target.|$|E
500|$|Van der Byl {{moved to}} Southern Rhodesia in 1950 to manage {{some of his}} family's tobacco farming interests, hoping {{to make his own}} fortune. Having visited the country many times as a youth, he remarked that after reading about the profits to be made from tobacco he [...] "suddenly got a rush of blood to the crotch about the tobacco boom and <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to go up there and make the family fortune in a place I liked and wanted to be in." [...] He welcomed the move as it allowed him to indulge his hobby of big game hunting: in that year in Angola, then under Portuguese rule, he set a world record for the biggest {{elephant}} shot, which stood until 1955.|$|E
500|$|The {{second of}} four daughters of a well-to-do dental surgeon and a housewife, Neila Balendra {{was born in}} 1938 in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). She began dancing {{at the age of}} five, and trained in the {{classical}} Indian dance traditions of Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kathakali and Manipuri at the Shanti Kumar School of Dance and the Kalaya School of Dance in Colombo. In 1954, she won the gold medal at the All-Ceylon Dance Festival and was selected to perform for Elizabeth II when the Queen visited Sri Lanka in April 1954 during her tour of the Commonwealth after acceding to the throne. Neila has said: [...] "That was the day I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to devote my life to dance. My father wanted me to become a dental surgeon, but I refused".|$|E

500|$|Drummer Lars Ulrich {{achieved}} a unique sound on St. Anger by {{turning off the}} snares on his snare drum resulting in a drum tone with far more [...] "ring" [...] than is usual in rock and metal. This sound received much backlash from fans and critics alike. Ulrich said, [...] "One day I forgot to turn the snare on because I wasn't thinking about this stuff. At the playbacks, I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really liking what I was hearing—it had a different ambience. It sang back {{to me in a}} beautiful way." [...] Regarding the backlash about the sound, he stated, [...] "It's crazy, that kind of closed-mindedness." [...] Rock said, [...] "I would say I've only [...] this brutal [...] when I've done demos. It probably sounds heavier because it's Metallica, but really this was a 15-minutes-on-the-drum-sound type of thing." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1966 onwards, The Kinks came to {{be known}} for their {{adherence}} to traditions of English music and culture, during a period when many other British bands dismissed their heritage in favour of American blues, R and pop styles. Ray Davies recalled that at a distinct moment in 1965 he decided to break away from the American scene, and write more introspective and intelligent songs. [...] "I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to use words more, and say things. I wrote 'Well Respected Man'. That was the first real word-oriented song I wrote. ... abandoned any attempt to Americanise my accent." [...] The Kinks' allegiance to English styles was strengthened by the ban placed on them by the American Federation of Musicians. The ban cut them off from the American record buying public, the world's largest musical market, forcing them to focus on Britain and mainland Europe. The Kinks expanded on their English sound throughout the remainder of the 1960s, fusing music hall and folk, and creating some of the most influential and important music of the period.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Stewart, who {{essentially}} hosted The Daily Show as himself, Colbert {{developed a}} correspondent character for his {{pieces on the}} series. Colbert has described his correspondent character as [...] "a fool who has {{spent a lot of}} his life playing not the fool– one who is able to cover it at least well enough to deal with the subjects that he deals with". Colbert was frequently pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, or against Stewart in scripted exchanges, with the resultant dialogue demonstrating the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he is discussing. Colbert also made generous use of humorous fallacies of logic in explaining his point of view on any topic. Other Daily Show correspondents have adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they [...] "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two". Correspondent Aasif Mandvi has stated [...] "I just <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to do my best Stephen Colbert impression".|$|E

500|$|Before the 1946 season, Feller {{signed a}} $50,000 {{contract}} for the year, including a bonus for attendance, as the Indians felt many were attending baseball games primarily to see him; he was offered $100,000 by Jorge Pasquel {{to play in the}} Mexican League, but declined to leave the States again. Feller recorded his second career no-hitter on April 30, 1946, against the New York Yankees. He allowed five walks and struck out 11 Yankees. Feller said of the game, [...] "The no-hitter on opening day in Chicago is the one that gets all the attention. But my no-hitter at Yankee Stadium was against a much better team than the White Sox. There was no comparison. I had to pitch to Tommy Henrich, Charlie Keller and Joe DiMaggio in the ninth inning to get the Yankees out." [...] At one point during the season (as Feller thought he might be nearing Rube Waddell's AL record for strikeouts), Feller confirmed Waddell's record of 344 strikeouts with the AL office as opposed to 349. In his last appearance of the season on September 29, Feller threw five strikeouts against the Detroit Tigers to set the then-AL single-season strikeout record. During the 1946 season, he registered career-highs in strikeouts (348), games started (42) and games pitched (48), shutouts (10), complete games (36) and innings pitched (377.1)—all major league bests that season. Feller finished 26–15 with an ERA of 2.18, the latter a career-low. Nearly 20 years later, Feller recalled, [...] "For the 1946 season, though, the Indians were so thin in pitching that Boudreau <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to pitch every fourth day, regardless of rainouts, open dates, or anything else." ...|$|E
2500|$|For many years, live {{performances}} were very occasional {{and almost always}} in Glasgow; he has stated publicly that he finds live performance [...] "incredibly nerve-racking: stomach cramps, tension headaches...". However, in recent years, he has performed more regularly (including a tour of New Zealand in 2010 and a UK tour in support of Damon and Naomi in 2011) {{and many of his}} recent shows have been predominantly vocal - he told The Wire (issue 284) [...] "I went to a laptop concert and <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to sing".|$|E

Therefore, I will run for the Lithuanian presidency.|$|R

Fluke spent the following three years trying to persuade {{the administration of the}} Jesuit college to change its policy regarding student contraceptive coverage.

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 22, {{after an}} {{involvement}} with Tommy Mottola and Epic Records {{following the end of}} his first deal with Interscope, Thicke resolved himself to work chiefly on material for his debut album, initially titled Cherry Blue Skies, planning to use his own money to fund the project. As Thicke told Billboard, [...] "I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to save money to make my album, and I hoped to offer it to labels–take it or leave it–so I didn't have to negotiate how to make my music." [...] While piecing his album together, Thicke began working with veteran producer and label executive Andre Harrell and, under his guidance, eventually signed [...] with Interscope for a second time as part of Harrell's and Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds' Nu America imprint label in 2001.|$|E

Moreover, as I have said, in deference to Prince K--- even the judges themselves were to be left in ignorance.

60|$|From {{a report}} upon the {{condition}} of the business before the American and Mexican Joint Claims Commission, made by the agent {{on the part of the}} United States, and dated October 28, 1874, it appears that of the 1,017 claims filed on the part of citizens of the United States, 483 had been finally decided and 75 were in the hands of the umpire, leaving 462 to be disposed of; and of the 998 claims filed against the United States, 726 had been finally <b>decided,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> before the umpire, and 271 remained to be disposed of. Since the date of such report other claims have been disposed of, reducing somewhat the number still pending; and others have been passed upon by the arbitrators. It has become apparent, in view of these figures and of the fact that the work devolving on the umpire is particularly laborious, that the commission will be unable to dispose of the entire number of claims pending prior to the 1st day of February, 1875--the date fixed for its expiration. Negotiations are pending looking to the securing of the results of the decisions which have been reached and to a further extension of the commission for a limited time, which it is confidently hoped will suffice to bring all the business now before it to a final close.|$|E
