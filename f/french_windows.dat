5|$|The main Scarborough School building, Vanderlip Hall, was {{designed}} by William W. Bosworth, known for landscaping Kykuit and restoring Versailles. The school building was constructed in a severe, all-white Neoclassical style, and was completed early in 1917. In addition to a grand porticoed entry, there were two wings that housed classes, a library, cafeteria and gymnasium, basement science labs, and an art room measuring , ringed on three sides with <b>French</b> <b>windows.</b> In the 1960s, an additional Modernist structure was built across a stream that would ultimately house the school's lower grades.|$|E
5|$|The two-storied {{structure}} is rectangular in plan. The portico has four Ionic columns with fluted stems and cabbage leaf capitals. The front gables {{of the building}} have Renaissance style plaster moulding. The {{lower part of the}} exterior walls are made of plastered brick. The upper windows have semi-circular <b>French</b> <b>windows,</b> with pilasters on both sides. In 1902 a new royal mint department was constructed outside the palace's walls and the old mint building was left vacant. The building was then first converted for use as a royal guards barracks and later as a royal guards officer's club.|$|E
5|$|The newer building, {{constructed}} in 1752 {{under the guidance}} of architects William Hiorne and his brother David, consists of five bays, with a large bay at the side, constructed around 1800 to connect it to the older building. There is a central portico, with a flat roof supported by four ionic columns, added in 1926. The tripartite windows of the ground floor contrast with the <b>French</b> <b>windows</b> of the first floor, which are fronted by cast iron balconies. The attic floor has small 4 x 2 pane windows. The rear of the house consists of four bays, with a large central window on the first floor and a central door, surrounded with ashlar cornicing. Both sections of the house are {{constructed in}} red Flemish bond brick, which, until 1926, was covered with render.|$|E

25|$|A garden door is any {{door that}} opens to a {{backyard}} or garden. This term {{is often used}} specifically for <b>French</b> <b>windows,</b> double French doors (with lites instead of panels), {{in place of a}} sliding glass door. The term also may refer to what is known as patio doors.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} kinds of doors, with {{different}} purposes. The most common type is the single-leaf door, which consists of a single rigid panel that fills the doorway. There are many variations on this basic design, such as the double-leaf door or double door and <b>French</b> <b>windows,</b> which have two adjacent independent panels hinged {{on each side of}} the doorway.|$|E
25|$|On either {{flank of}} the entrance, the first floor {{features}} <b>French</b> <b>windows</b> and iron balconies, except for the smaller windows next to the door, trimmed with marble lintels and sills. A similar pattern is found on the larger windows of the third story. Above them is a dentilled cornice and architrave; two large chimneys rise from the hipped roof. The rear elevation features two porches with Doric columns.|$|E

The room is empty for a moment and Costello re-enters through the <b>French</b> <b>windows.</b> Like Jeremy before, he starts to go through the contents of the desk with the secret drawer. Behind him, the door of the hidden recess opens and an unseen hand clubs him down. He falls to the ground behind a sofa. After Clarissa shows her husband off, she re-enters the room and soon finds the body of Costello. Almost instantly Pippa comes through the hidden recess and starts babbling hysterically that she is responsible. Clarissa tries to calm her down while wondering what she will do...|$|E
25|$|At home, Liza {{plays the}} spinet {{as she and}} her friend Pauline sing a duet about evening in the countryside. Their girlfriends ask to hear more, so Pauline {{launches}} into a sad ballad, followed by a dancelike song. As the merriment increases, Liza remains pensively apart. A Governess chides the girls for indulging in unbecoming folk dancing and asks the visitors to leave. Pauline, the last to go, urges Liza to cheer up; Liza replies that after a storm there is a beautiful night and asks the maid, Masha, not to close the <b>French</b> <b>windows</b> to the balcony. Alone, Liza voices her unhappiness with her engagement; she has been stirred by the romantic look {{of the young man}} in the park. To her shock, Herman appears on the balcony. Claiming he is about to shoot himself over her betrothal to another, he begs her to take pity on him. When the Countess is heard knocking, Liza hides Herman and opens the door to the old woman, who tells her to shut the windows and go to bed. After the Countess retires, Liza asks Herman to leave but is betrayed by her feelings and falls into his embrace.|$|E

500|$|On {{the first}} floor, at the head-of the east main staircase, was the Astor Gallery, , looking out on 34th Street. The gallery, with seven <b>French</b> <b>windows</b> {{reaching}} [...] {{from floor to}} ceiling, opened out on a terrace over {{the entrance to the}} hotel. The interior was finished {{in the style of the}} Hôtel de Soubise, with a blue, gray and gold color scheme. There was a parquet floor, and on the south side, opposite the street windows, were other windows which opened into the main corridor on the second floor. The musicians' balcony, upheld by two caryatids, was at the east end. All the balcony railings were of gilded metal work. The mural paintings were notable: four panels, two at either end of the room, and twelve pendentive panels, six on either side and painted by Edward Simmons depicted the four seasons and the twelve months of the year. [...] The [...] "Colonial Room" [...] was decorated in red, contrasting with white woodwork. The second floor contained a private suite of apartments at the northeast corner, with large drawing rooms, dining room, butler's pantry, hallway, three bedrooms, three maids' bedrooms and five bathrooms, all finished in old English oak. All the floors above the third were given up to suites and bedrooms up to the 14th floor. There was a bath for nearly every room, and every bathroom had windows opening to the air, not into shafts. In every room, there was a large trunk closet.|$|E
500|$|A shot where Lester and Ricky share a {{cannabis}} joint {{behind a}} building {{came from a}} misunderstanding between Hall and Mendes. Mendes asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy, so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building, intending to light {{from the top of}} the truck. When Mendes returned, he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen. He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting; he lit it from the left, with a large light crossing the actors, and with a soft light behind the camera. Hall felt the consequent wide shot [...] "worked perfectly for the tone of the scene". Hall made sure to keep rain, or the suggestion of it, in every shot near the end of the film. In one shot during Lester's encounter with Angela at the Burnhams' home, Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights; in another, he partly lit the pair through <b>French</b> <b>windows</b> to which he had added material to make the rain run slower, intensifying the light (although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene, Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced). For the close-ups when Lester and Angela move to the couch, Hall tried to keep rain in the frame, lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester. He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room.|$|E

2500|$|The Quincy Mansion (1848) {{purchased}} by the college in 1919 was demolished in 1969. Its chandeliers were sold for food during the Great Depression. It was once part of the Quincy family homestead along with the Dorothy Quincy House and the Josiah Quincy House, on a [...] parcel of land known as the [...] "Lower Farm". The mansion itself was situated on the land where Angell Hall now stands, and was the summer home of Josiah Quincy, Jr., then mayor of Boston. It was three stories and white, in Georgian architecture, with marble fireplaces {{in most of the}} rooms and large <b>French</b> <b>windows</b> on the first floor that [...] "opened upon either little balconies or broad piazzas." [...] Elm Avenue had been the avenue, or driveway, for the two mansions on the property. The first of the two, the Josiah Quincy House (1770), still stands on Muirhead Street.|$|E
2500|$|The {{property}} was subsequently sold to Dr. Thomas White for $500. In 1858, Dr. White conveyed the [...] "Old Mill Site" [...] {{to his daughter}} Fannie Kewen; she and her husband, Col. E. J. C. Kewen, both lived there for 20 years. The Kewens added onto the building, installing <b>French</b> <b>windows,</b> a front portico, and a small plaza. Col. Kewen {{has been described as}} [...] "old-time Southern gentleman" [...] and [...] "one of the most courteous and politely-polished men California has ever seen." [...] There are many accounts of parties hosted by the Kewens at the Old Mill and of their [...] "prodigal hospitality" [...] and [...] "gracious style of living". It was said that [...] "the gallant and gay gathered from miles 'round, listened to the twanging of the guitar and the jolly click of the castenets, and through it all danced gay dances on the floors that once had echoed the quiet footfall of the priest." [...] In 1879, the Kewens defaulted on a mortgage, and the {{property was}} foreclosed on by J. Edward Hollenbeck. Hollenbeck sold the property to Edward Mayberry in 1881, who used the structure as housing for his ranch superintendent.|$|E

5000|$|The Henri Matisse {{paintings}} <b>French</b> <b>Window</b> at Collioure, and View of Notre-Dame {{both from}} 1914 exerted tremendous influence on Richard Diebenkorn's Ocean Park paintings.According to art historian Jane Livingston, Diebenkorn saw both Matisse paintings {{in an exhibition}} in Los Angeles in 1966 and they had {{an enormous impact on}} him and his work. Livingston says about the January 1966 Matisse exhibition that Diebenkorn saw in Los Angeles:It is difficult not to ascribe enormous weight to this experience for the direction his work took from that time on. Two pictures he saw there reverberate in almost every Ocean Park canvas. View of Notre Dame and <b>French</b> <b>Window</b> at Collioure, both painted in 1914, were on view {{for the first time in}} the US.Livingston goes on to say [...] "Diebenkorn must have experienced <b>French</b> <b>Window</b> at Collioure as an epiphany." ...|$|R
