50|$|Rickenbacker was {{the first}} {{manufacturer}} who began producing stereo bass guitars with a stereo output for each pickup section. The neck pickup had one output and the bridge pickup had one. Also Teisco produced a guitar with a stereo option. Teisco divided the two sections in the upper three strings and the lower three strings for each individual output. The Gittler guitar was an experimental guitar with six pickups, one for each string. The Go! Team has modified a Fender Telecaster with an additional rotated pickup for the upper string, causing a simulation of a one string bass sound.Gibson also created the HD.6X Pro guitar with The Hex Pickup that captures a separate signal for each individual string and sends it to the onboard analog/digital converter, which uses Gibson's <b>digital</b> <b>transport</b> technology to send the signal out of the guitar via Cat 5 Ethernet Cable. The output can be routed as a single summed mono signal to an amplifier or recording console. It can also send the E, A, and D strings to one amp or recording channel and the G, B, and high E to a separate amp or channel. Or it can send the output of all six individual strings to six different amps or channels. These six individualized outputs can used to create various effects.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} survey of {{transport}} methods for 3 -D video ranging from early analog 3 DTV systems to most recent digital technologies that show promise in designing 3 DTV systems of tomorrow. Potential <b>digital</b> <b>transport</b> architectures for 3 DTV include the DVB architecture for, broadcast and the Internet Protocol (IP) architecture for wired or wireless streaming. There are different multiview representation/compression methods for delivering the 3 -D experience which provide a tradeoff between compression efficiency, random access to views, and ease of rate adaptation, including the "video plus-depth" compressed representation and various multiview video coding (MVC) options. Commercial activities using these representations in broadcast and IP streaming have emerged, and successful transport of such data has been reported. Motivated by the growing impact of the Internet protocol based media transport technologies, {{we focus on the}} ubiquitous Internet as the network infrastructure of choice for future 3 DTV systems. Current research issues in unicast and multicast mode multiview video streaming include network protocols such as DCCP and peer-to-peer protocols, effective congestion control, packet loss protection and concealment, video rate adaptation, and network/service scalability.

40|$|We have earlier {{presented}} a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) method for 2 : 1 bandwidth reduction [1], a method we have called Shannon mappings. There, two samples from a Gaussian iid source of bandwidth B are transmitted over an AWGN channel of bandwidth B, using discrete-time and continuous-amplitude channel symbols. Now {{we want to}} extend this scheme to include a <b>digital</b> <b>transport</b> network between {{the point of the}} received JSSC symbols and the ultimate destination. Since the JSCC symbols are continuous-amplitude, some form of digitising or transcoding is necessary before transmission on the digital network. Instead of decoding the JSCC symbols and subsequently applying a digital source coder, we propose using a uniform scalar quantization directly on the received channel symbols. The quantizer can be either be applied at the receiver side, maintaining the scheme from [1], or it can be applied at the transmitter with jointly optimised JSCC and quantization. In the latter case, we give a model for the total distortion and solve this numerically with Matlab’s optimisation toolbox. However, the resulting parameters are proportional to the parameters for the unquantized system [1], so this approach is no mor...|$|E
