The stiffness method is the most popular by far thanks to its ease of implementation as well as of formulation for advanced applications.

2500|$|High {{levels of}} {{conspicuous}} consumption {{may be seen}} as socially undesirable on two grounds; firstly, as it is often associated with high relative income, high levels of conspicuous consumption may be an indicator of high levels of income inequality, which may be found intrinsically or instrumentally objectionable; secondly conspicuous consumption differs from other forms of consumption in that the main reason for the purchase of positional goods is not due to the additional direct utility provided by the goods alleged high quality, but rather the social prestige associated with the consumption of that good. One downside of this search for status is that individual purchases of positional goods may at a social level be self-defeating due to <b>external</b> <b>effects.</b> In this case, the externality is status anxiety, the loss of social status suffered by people whose stock of high-status goods (positional goods) is diminished, in relation to the stocks of other conspicuous consumers, as they increase their consumption of high-status goods and services; effectively, status-seeking is a zero-sum game—by definition, the rise of one person in the social hierarchy can occur only {{at the expense of other}} people. Therefore, the conspicuous consumption of luxury goods and services (positional goods) is an economic loss—like competitive military spending (an arms race), [...] wherein each country must match the military expenditures of other countries in the arms race, or suffer a loss of relative military power. In the case of conspicuous consumption, taxes upon luxury goods diminish societal expenditures on high-status goods, by rendering them more expensive than non-positional goods. In this sense, luxury taxes can be seen as a market failure correcting [...] Pigovian tax—with an apparent negative deadweight loss, these taxes are a [...] more efficient mechanism for increasing revenue than 'distorting' labour or capital taxes.|$|E

Now, the foundation of the attribute may be a phenomenon of any degree of complexity, consisting of many different parts, either co-existent or in succession.

6000|$|Another eminent naturalist, Professor Karl Semper of Würzburg, also adopts {{the view}} of the direct {{transforming}} power of the environment, and has brought together an immense body of interesting facts showing the influence of food, of light, of temperature, of still water and moving water, of the atmosphere and its currents, of gravitation, and of other organisms, in modifying the forms and other characteristics of animals.[207] He believes that these various influences produce a direct and important effect, and that this effect is accumulated by inheritance; yet he acknowledges that we have no direct evidence of this, and there is hardly a single case adduced in the book which is not equally well explained by adaptation, brought about by the survival of beneficial variations. Perhaps the most remarkable case he has brought forward is that of the transformation of species of crustaceans by a change in the saltness of the water (see Fig. 35). Artemia salina lives in brackish water, while A. Milhausenii inhabits water which is much salter. They differ greatly {{in the form of the}} tail-lobes, and in the presence or absence of spines upon the tail, and had always been considered perfectly distinct species. Yet either was transformed into the other in a few generations, during which the saltness of the water was gradually altered. Yet more, A. salina was gradually accustomed to fresher water, and in the course of a few generations, when the water had become perfectly fresh, the species was changed into Branchipus stagnalis, which had always been considered to belong to a different genus on account of differences in the form of the antennae and of the posterior segments of the body (see Fig. 36). This certainly appears to be a proof of change of conditions producing a change of form independently of selection, and of that change of form, while remaining under the same conditions, being inherited. Yet there is this peculiarity in the case, that there is a chemical change in the water, and that this water permeates the whole body, and must be absorbed by the tissues, and thus affect the ova and even the reproductive elements, and in this way may profoundly modify the whole organisation. Why and how the <b>external</b> <b>effects</b> are limited to special details of the structure we do not know; but it does not seem as if any far-reaching conclusions as to the cumulative effect of external conditions on the higher terrestrial animals and plants, can be drawn from such an exceptional phenomenon. It seems rather analogous to those effects of external influences on the very lowest organisms in which the vegetative and reproductive organs are hardly differentiated, in which case such effects are doubtless inherited.[208] ...|$|E

This exerts a considerable impact on merger policy conclusions: while several insights of the original analysis are corroborated (e. g., efficiency defense), a positive <b>external</b> <b>effect</b> does not represent a sufficient condition for the allowance of a merger any longer.

We investigate nonparametric system identification with an explicit focus on periodically recurring nonlinear effects. Within a Gaussian process regression framework, we design a locally periodic covariance function to shape the hypothesis space, which allows for a structured extrapolation that is not possible with more widely used covariance functions. These predictions are then used in model predictive control to construct a control signal correcting for the predicted <b>external</b> <b>effect.</b> We show that this approach is beneficial for state sampling times that are smaller than, but comparable to, the period length of the <b>external</b> <b>effect.</b> In experiments on a physical system, an electrically actuated telescope mount, this approach achieves a reduction of about 20 % in root mean square error.
