5|$|A {{speculator}} to <b>his</b> very core, Little {{never put}} away any of <b>his</b> fortune {{to prepare for}} a rainy day; any money he made on the stock market, he immediately invested back into it. Thus when the Panic of 1857 destroyed <b>his</b> investment fortune, Little was left penniless. He would live out the rest of <b>his</b> life under the wing of <b>his</b> last protége, David Groesbeck. Little was only ever able to make small trading returns to the market in <b>his</b> later years, and the magnitude of <b>his</b> fall was often the target of mockery from <b>his</b> former peers. He died a broken man. Little died on March 28, 1865, and <b>his</b> funeral was held on March 31 at New York's Grace Church. <b>His</b> pall-bearers included Jesse Hoyt and Edward Prime; Reverend Thomas House Taylor officiated at <b>his</b> funeral.|$|E
5|$|According to Kint, Söze began <b>his</b> {{criminal}} {{career as}} a petty drug dealer in <b>his</b> native Turkey. <b>His</b> legendary persona is born when rival Hungarian smugglers invade <b>his</b> house while he is away, rape <b>his</b> wife, and hold <b>his</b> children hostage; when Söze arrives, they kill one of <b>his</b> children and demand he surrender <b>his</b> business. Instead, Söze kills <b>his</b> own family and {{all but one of}} the Hungarians, who he knows will tell the Mafia what has happened. Once <b>his</b> family is buried, Söze targets the Hungarian Mafia, their families, friends, and people who owe them money. He goes underground, never again doing business in person.|$|E
5|$|According to <b>his</b> biographer Nicholas Shakespeare, Chatwin's work {{developed}} a cult-like {{following in the}} years immediately following <b>his</b> death. By 1998 one million copies of <b>his</b> books had been sold. However, <b>his</b> reputation diminished following revelations about <b>his</b> personal life and questions about the accuracy of <b>his</b> work.|$|E

5|$|After <b>his</b> {{service on}} the {{commission}} ended, Hogg resumed practising law in Northern England, where <b>his</b> brother John had also recently begun to practice.

5|$|After <b>his</b> third {{successive}} victory, with <b>his</b> {{win over}} Henning Svendsen in March 2006, Wallhead made <b>his</b> first title defense of <b>his</b> House of Pain Welterweight title {{just two weeks}} later. <b>His</b> opponent was John Phillips who was making <b>his</b> second professional appearance. Wallhead defeated Phillips to retain the title, after a TKO victory due to elbows.|$|E

60|$|We {{never saw}} that boy ag'in. He never turned up for <b>'is</b> box, and 'e didn't {{show up to}} draw <b>'is</b> pay.

5|$|After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly {{understood}} that <b>his</b> military decisions {{would be more}} effectively carried out by conveying <b>his</b> orders through <b>his</b> War Secretary or <b>his</b> general-in-chief on to <b>his</b> generals, who resented <b>his</b> civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to <b>his</b> generals as Commander-in-Chief.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of <b>his</b> work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired to <b>his</b> home in Kensington, west London. <b>His</b> former partner, Mary Austin, had been a particular comfort in <b>his</b> final years, {{and in the last}} few weeks of <b>his</b> life made regular visits to <b>his</b> home to look after him. Near the end of <b>his</b> life Mercury was starting to lose <b>his</b> sight, and he deteriorated to the point where he could not get out of bed. Due to <b>his</b> worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten <b>his</b> death by refusing to take <b>his</b> medication and continued taking only painkillers.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after <b>his</b> death miracles were reported at <b>his</b> funeral and at <b>his</b> tomb. <b>His</b> remains were translated {{to a different}} burial spot in the cathedral ten years after <b>his</b> death. <b>His</b> feast day is celebrated on 28 February during common years and 29 February during leap years.|$|E

5|$|As Bryan spoke <b>his</b> final sentence, {{recalling the}} Crucifixion of Jesus, he placed <b>his</b> hands to <b>his</b> temples, fingers {{extended}}; {{with the final}} words, he extended <b>his</b> arms to <b>his</b> sides straight out to <b>his</b> body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence. He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began {{to head back to}} <b>his</b> seat as the stillness held.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Shearer {{was often}} styled {{as a classic}} English centre-forward, owing to <b>his</b> strength, {{physical}} stature, heading ability and strong shot, which enabled him to be highly prolific goalscorer. Of <b>his</b> 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with <b>his</b> head. Earlier in <b>his</b> career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing chances for fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to <b>his</b> early development as a midfielder. Later on in <b>his</b> career, Shearer played a more forward role, after <b>his</b> age robbed him of some of <b>his</b> pace. Able to hold the ball up well, he often functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players. Although <b>his</b> strength allowed him {{to hold on to}} the ball, <b>his</b> playing style sometimes brought him criticism – most commonly that <b>his</b> play was too physical, and that he used <b>his</b> elbows too aggressively. It was this which contributed to both of <b>his</b> sendings off, although one was later rescinded on appeal.|$|E

5|$|As {{a tribute}} to <b>his</b> then-pregnant wife, Ilary Blasi, Totti imitated a {{childbirth}} scene by stuffing the ball under <b>his</b> shirt and lying on <b>his</b> back while <b>his</b> teammates extracted the ball. <b>His</b> current ritual of sucking <b>his</b> thumb after a goal began after <b>his</b> son was born and continued {{after the birth of}} <b>his</b> daughter. Blasi has revealed that Totti also sucks <b>his</b> thumb in dedication to her and not just for their children. On 11 January 2015, Totti scored twice against Lazio in the Derby della Capitale as Roma came back from 2–0 down; he then took a selfie with Roma fans.|$|E
5|$|As president-elect, Taylor kept <b>his</b> {{distance}} from Washington, not resigning <b>his</b> Western Division command until late January 1849. He spent the {{months following the}} election formulating <b>his</b> cabinet selections. He was deliberate and quiet about <b>his</b> decisions, to the frustration of <b>his</b> fellow Whigs. While he despised patronage and political games, he endured a flurry of advances from office-seekers looking {{to play a role}} in <b>his</b> administration.|$|E
5|$|As the day wears on, Michael becomes {{convinced}} {{that what happened}} to <b>his</b> office is a hate crime and an act of terrorism. Believing it to have been perpetrated by someone in the office, he begins to lose <b>his</b> faith in <b>his</b> employees, whom he considers <b>his</b> friends. Michael tries talking to <b>his</b> former boss Ed Truck (Ken Howard), who tells him {{that he does not}} need to have <b>his</b> employees be <b>his</b> friends. But <b>his</b> mood changes drastically when he finds out the prank was carried out by <b>his</b> obnoxious friend Todd Packer (David Koechner). Michael instantly finds the joke hilarious, and <b>his</b> faith in <b>his</b> friends is restored. At the end of the day, Jim is cheered up when he finds that all seven of <b>his</b> voicemail messages were left by Pam throughout the day. Jim is seen driving home, and Pam's voicemails act as a voice-over, closing out the episode.|$|E

5|$|At Will Bloom’s wedding party, <b>his</b> father Edward {{recalls the}} day Will was born, {{claiming}} he caught an enormous catfish using <b>his</b> wedding ring as bait.

Three years later, Edward is stricken with cancer, so Will and <b>his</b> pregnant French wife Joséphine return to <b>his</b> childhood home in Alabama {{to spend time with}} <b>his</b> father. Edward’s life is told through flashbacks, beginning with <b>his</b> encounter with a witch in <b>his</b> hometown, Ashton. She shows him <b>his</b> death but he reacts to it without fear. As he grows into adulthood, he finds <b>his</b> home too confining, and sets out into the world with a misunderstood giant, Karl, who has come to town with a traveling circus.|$|E
5|$|At the {{expiration}} of <b>his</b> term as governor, Desha retired from public life to <b>his</b> farm in Harrison County. During {{the final years}} of <b>his</b> life, Desha and <b>his</b> wife Margaret moved to Georgetown, Kentucky, where one of <b>his</b> sons, a physician, lived. Desha died at <b>his</b> home in Georgetown, Kentucky, on October 11, 1842, and was buried on the grounds. The state erected a monument over <b>his</b> grave. In 1880, both Desha's body and the monument were moved to Georgetown Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of <b>his</b> death, Nolan was the last male member of <b>his</b> family, and the line died with him.
