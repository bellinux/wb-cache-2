40|$|Anti-CD 4 antibodies, {{which cause}} CD 4 + T-cell depletion, {{have been shown}} to {{increase}} susceptibility to infections in mice. Thus, development of anti-CD 4 antibodies for clinical use raises potential concerns about suppression of host defense mechanisms against pathogens and tumors. The anti-human CD 4 antibody <b>keliximab,</b> which binds only human and chimpanzee CD 4, has been evaluated in host defense models using murine CD 4 knockout-human CD 4 transgenic (HuCD 4 /Tg) mice. In these mice, depletion of CD 4 + T cells by <b>keliximab</b> was associated with inhibition of anti-Pneumocystis carinii and anti-Candida albicans antibody responses and rendered HuCD 4 /Tg mice susceptible to P. carinii, a CD 4 -dependent pathogen, but did not compromise host defense against C. albicans infection. Treatment of HuCD 4 /Tg mice with corticosteroids impaired host immune responses and decreased survival for both infections. Resistance to experimental B 16 melanoma metastases was not affected by treatment with <b>keliximab,</b> in contrast to an increase in tumor colonization caused by anti-T cell Thy 1. 2 and anti-asialo GM- 1 antibodies. These data suggest an immunomodulatory rather than an overt immunosuppressive activity of <b>keliximab.</b> This was further demonstrated by the differential effect of <b>keliximab</b> on type 1 and type 2 cytokine expression in splenocytes stimulated ex vivo. <b>Keliximab</b> caused an initial up-regulation of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and gamma interferon, followed by transient down-regulation of IL- 4 and IL- 10. Taken together, the effects of <b>keliximab</b> in HuCD 4 /Tg mice suggest that in addition to depleting circulating CD 4 + T lymphocytes, <b>keliximab</b> has the capability of modulating the function of the remaining cells without causing general immunosuppression. Therefore, <b>keliximab</b> therapy may be beneficial in controlling certain autoimmune diseases...|$|E
40|$|Clenoliximab and <b>keliximab</b> are monkey/human {{chimeric}} monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of the immunoglobulin G 4 (IgG 4) and IgG 1 isotypes, respectively, that {{recognize the}} same epitope on human CD 4. The two mAbs possess identical idiotypes and exhibit equal affinities for CD 4. Upon administration of these mAbs to mice that express a human CD 4 transgene, but not mouse CD 4 (HuCD 4 /Tg mice), clenoliximab and <b>keliximab</b> exhibited similar kinetics of binding to CD 4, and induced {{the same degree}} of CD 4 modulation from the cell surface, although only <b>keliximab</b> mediated CD 4 + T-cell depletion. Epicutaneous sensitization and challenge of HuCD 4 /Tg mice with the hapten oxazolone resulted in a contact sensitivity response characterized by tissue swelling, and the presence of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) in the local tissue. Administration of a single 2 -mg dose of either clenoliximab or <b>keliximab</b> to HuCD 4 /Tg mice prior to sensitization significantly reduced post-challenge tissue swelling, and levels of IFN-γ and IL- 4, indicating that CD 4 + T-cell depletion is not required for anti-CD 4 mAb-mediated inhibition of contact sensitivity. Administration of either mAb prior to challenge failed to inhibit the contact sensitivity response, indicating differential sensitivity of the afferent and efferent phases of the response to inhibition by CD 4 -specific mAbs. Collectively, these data indicate that CD 4 functions as a positive regulatory molecule in the contact sensitivity response...|$|E
40|$|<b>Keliximab</b> and {{clenoliximab}} are monkey/human chimeric CD 4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of the IgG 1 and IgG 4 isotypes, respectively. The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynam-ics (PD) {{of these}} mAbs were evaluated in transgenic mice bearing human CD 4 molecules on their T cells after a single i. v. administration at three dose levels (5 – 125 mg/kg). The PK of <b>keliximab</b> and clenoliximab were similar, dose-dependent, and adequately {{described by a}} two-compartment model with sat-urable elimination from both compartments. The enumeration of circulating CD 41 T cells and density of CD 4 on their surface were determined as the PD effects. An indirect response model was proposed to characterize the PD effects. With the increase in mAb dose, the maximum intensity (Rmax) of PD effects was increased, and the time to reach Rmax shifted to later times. A...|$|E
40|$|High-quality {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAbs) with specificity for relevant disease molecules can now {{be produced}} in abundance. Anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha therapies have set a new standard for symptom control in rheumatoid arthritis, and blockade of tumour necrosis factor {{has the potential to}} protect joints from structural damage. Other targets for therapeutic antibodies include the cytokines interleukin (IL) - 1, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 15, IL- 17 and IL- 18. In addition, there is preliminary evidence for the clinical efficacy of both <b>keliximab,</b> a mAb targeting the T cell antigen CD 4, and rituximab, a chimeric mAb against the B cell antigen CD 20 and CTLA 4 -Ig, which blocks the CD 28 /B 7 interaction. Phase III studies have yet to be undertaken for these novel biological agents, and it is unclear whether any of these agents will have true disease-modifying capabilities...|$|E
