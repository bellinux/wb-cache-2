An information system for support of intelligence activities is very often in everyday use and from that use comes great influence in the decision making process. Usage of the modern information technology in big way contributes for improvement of the process (activities) which are supporting <b>intelligence</b> <b>cycles</b> (planning, collecting, analyzing and dissemination). Although there is constant improvement {{as a result of}} the progress in the area of information technology, significant difference in the quality of work in the field of intelligence has not taken place in the last ten years. Implementation of Service Oriented Architecture – SOA, i. e. the usage of SOA, is providing possibilities for making new opportunities in the form of expanded solutions for designing intelligence information systems, regarding the more efficient management of information, as well as their use by the end users for whom hum they are intended. In order to keep up with the pace with modern development, short, medium and long term planning is needed for development of information systems for supporting intelligence, in relation to the of IT development. This paper presents an idea for SOA approach in prototype of Intelligence Information System. Prototype of IIS is a solution which should offer better coordination and Intelligence effectiveness.

There have been many attempts to develop approaches to tackle this problem, but unfortunately acting effectively against deliberate fires has proven a complex challenge. This article reviews the current situation relating to deliberate fires: what do we know, how serious is the situation, how is it being dealt with, and what challenges are faced when developing a systematic and global methodology to tackle the issues? The repetitive nature of some types of deliberate fires will also be discussed. Finally, drawing on the reality of repetition within deliberate fires and encouraged by successes obtained in previous repetitive crimes (such as property crimes or drug trafficking), we {{will argue that the}} use of the <b>intelligence</b> process <b>cycle</b> as a framework to allow a follow-up and systematic analysis of fire events is a relevant approach. This is the first article of a series of three articles.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to create understanding about external business information needs of decision-makers and to compare and analyze differences in the information needs of strategic and sales and marketing decision-makers. Information needs are analyzed {{both in terms of}} themes and information characteristics. The research problem stems from the contemporary information environment of decision-makers: the information paradox of generally too much information {{and at the same time}} lack of relevant and useful information. To help solving this mismatch and to better understand what is the relevant information from decision-makers’ perspective it is necessary to drill down deeper into the information needs of decision-makers. The research aims to narrow the gap in understanding what is the relevant information from decision-makers’ perspective, and by this understanding to bring closer the decision-makers and the actors that provide information for them. The data in this study was collected by interviewing nine employees of the case company, Outokumpu Oyj. The employees were from two decision-making domains, namely strategy and sales and marketing. The main findings of this study suggest that clear thematic and characteristic distinctions were observable between the information needs of strategic and sales and marketing decision-makers. There were some clear thematic differences in the information needs while in terms of information characteristics differences were clear in some characteristics, but there were also characteristics in which no clear differences were observable. Acknowledging that decision-makers in different decision-making domains require different information, both in terms of information themes as well as information characteristics, is crucial for successful implementation of business <b>intelligence</b> process <b>cycle,</b> as information needs identification is one of the key phases of the cycle. Although the identification of information needs alone may not improve decisions, it is a prerequisite for the information management cycle to be effective as a whole...|$|R

Finally, the idea that decision-makers wait for the delivery of intelligence before making policy decisions is equally incorrect.

AMC intelligence personnel will be well-trained professionals in partnership with tactics and operations functions. This course fills a vital need in the <b>intelligence</b> training <b>cycle.</b> The first week of instruction is set in the classroom and is used to explore the different avenues of intelligence as it pertains to the airlift community. The second week of instruction demonstrates the practical application of intelligence by integrating the intelligence students with the airlift crews. This gives the opportunity for the intelligence students and the aircrew to exchange information. This training includes: Preparation for Deployments, Message Processing, Debriefing and Reporting, Military Airlift Capabilities & C-130 Safety, a Situation briefing exercise, a mission briefing exercise, and other “need to know” areas. The PIC attendees will provide the intelligence scenario and then accompany the crew on the mission. This provides the PIC attendees with a valuable insight as to how the airlift aircrews use intelligence information to accomplish their mission.

This thesis explores the implications of initial levels of intelligence vis-aÌ -vis the scope, organization, modus operandi, and composition of nascent insurgent movements. Specifically, the thesis considers the role that particular types of intelligence play in allowing for effective repression targeting and timing to counter emerging insurgent threats. Furthermore, we explore and expand upon the notion proposed by Mohammed Hafez that a reactive and indiscriminate repression policy, attendant on a paucity of initial intelligence, has the effect of causing a nascent insurgent movement to become: 1) increasingly violent; 2) less visible to the state as it resorts to informal networks for mobilization and operation; and 3) expanded in size as a greater number of individuals become alienated from the state and find common cause with the insurgent movement and its framing of the conflict. Finally, we consider how adaptive states may learn from the dynamic interaction with insurgent movements by improving their intelligence paradigm to generate that intelligence which allows for increasingly proactive and discriminate repression.
