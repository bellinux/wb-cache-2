40|$|Problems {{about future}} energy availability, climate changes, and air quality seem {{to play an}} {{important}} role in energy production. While current reactor generations provide a guaranteed and economical energy production, new nuclear power plant generation would increase the ways and purposes in which nuclear energy can be used. To explore these new technological applications, several governments, industries, and research communities decided to contribute to the next reactor generation, called “Generation IV. ” Among the six Gen-IV reactor designs, the Gas Cooled Fast Reactor (GCFR) uses a <b>direct-cycle</b> helium turbine for electricity generation and for a CO 2 -free thermochemical production of hydrogen. Additionally, the use of a fast spectrum allows actinides transmutation, minimizing the production of long-lived radioactive waste in an integrated fuel cycle. This paper presents an analysis of GCFR fuel cycle optimization and of a thermal-hydraulic of a GCFR-prototype under steady-state and transient conditions. The fuel cycle optimization was performed to assess the capability of the GCFR to transmute MAs, while the thermal-hydraulic analysis was performed to investigate the reactor and the safety systems behavior during a LOFA.

40|$|The use of {{supercritical}} {{temperature and}} pressure light water as the coolant in a <b>direct-cycle</b> nuclear reactor offers potential for considerable plant simplification and consequent capital and O&M cost reduction compared with current light water reactor (LWR) designs. Also, given the thermodynamic {{conditions of the}} coolant at the core outlet (i. e. temperature and pressure beyond the water critical point), very high thermal efficiencies of the power conversion cycle are possible (i. e. up to 46 %). Because no change of phase occurs in the core, the need for steam separators and dryers {{as well as for}} BWR-type recirculation pumps is eliminated, which, for a given reactor power, results in a substantially shorter reactor vessel than the current BWRs. Furthermore, in a direct cycle the steam generators are not needed. If a tight fuel rod lattice is adopted, it is possible to significantly reduce the neutron moderation and attain fast neutron energy spectrum conditions. In this project a supercritical water reactor concept with a simple, blanket-free, pancake-shaped core will be developed. This type of core can make use of either fertile or fertile-free fuel and retain the hard spectrum to effectively burn plutonium and minor actinides from LWR spent fuel while efficiently generating electricity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The VHTR modular reactor {{is one of}} six {{advanced}} fission {{systems of}} interest for meeting the Generation IV goals of attaining highly economic, safe, reliable, sustainable, proliferation-resistant systems. The VHTR offers significant advantages for long-term development of sustainable energy and in particular for heat applications and hydrogen generation. This system can operate with either a direct or indirect cycle and makes use of the high efficiency brayton cycle. The GCFR system, which features a fast-spectrum helium-cooled reactor and closed fuel cycle is also capable of delivering electricity, hydrogen, or process heat with a high conversion efficiency. Again this system can operate with either a direct or indirect cycle. The reference concept for the GCFR uses a <b>direct-cycle</b> helium turbine. For the VHTR both the pebble bed (e. g. PBMR) and block type (e. g. ANTARES) are under development.

40|$|The Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) {{is one of}} six systems {{selected}} for viability assessment in the Generation IV program. It features a closed nuclear fuel cycle, consisting of a high-temperature helium-cooled fast spectrum reactor, coupled to a <b>direct-cycle</b> helium turbine for electricity production. The GFR combines the advances of fast spectrum systems with those of high-temperature systems. It {{was clear from the}} very beginning that GFR design should be driven by the objective to offer a complementary approach to liquid metal cooling. On this basis, CEA and the US DOE decided to collaborate on the pre-conceptual design of a GFR. This reactor design will provide a high level of safety and full recycling of the actinides, and will also be highly proliferation resistant and economically attractive. The status of this collaborative project is that two unit sizes, 600 MWt and 2400 MWt were selected as the focus of the design and safety studies. Researchers studied fuel forms, fuel assembly/element designs, core configurations, primary and balance-of-plant layouts, and safety approaches for both of these unit sizes. Results regarding the feasibility of this GFR design are encouraging. For example, sustainability and non-proliferation goals can be met and the proposed concept has attractive safety features. These features take advantage of the helium in terms of its neutronic quasi-transparency as well as the enhanced Doppler effect in connection with candidate fuel and structural materials. The current design trend is to consider high unit power for the GFR (2400 MWt), an attractive level for the power density (100 MW/m{sup 3 }), and the implementation of an innovative plate type fuel or pin type sub-assembly with carbide-based actinide compounds and SiC-based structural materials. Work is still needed to refine the safety approach, to select the main system options, and to more definitively establish economic parameters...|$|E
40|$|Thorium as {{a nuclear}} fuel is {{receiving}} renewed interest, {{because of its}} widespread availability and the good irradiation performance of Th and mixed (Th,U) oxide compounds as fuels in nuclear power systems. Early HTR development employed thorium together with high-enriched uranium. After 1980, most HTR fuel systems switched to low-enriched uranium. After completing fuel development for AVR and THTR with BISO coated particles, the German program expanded efforts on a new program utilizing thorium and high-enriched uranium TRISO coated particles for advanced HTR concepts for process heat applications (PNP) and <b>direct-cycle</b> electricity production (HHT). The combination of LTI inner and outer pyrocarbon layers surrounding a strong, stable SiC layer greatly improved manufacturing conditions and the subsequent contamination and defective particle fractions in production fuel elements. In addition, this combination provided improved mechanical strength and {{a higher degree of}} solid fission product retention, not known previously with HTI-BISO coatings. The improved performance of the HEU (Th,U) O 2 TRISO fuel system was successfully demonstrated in three primary areas of development: manufacturing, irradiation testing under normal operating conditions, and accident simulation testing. In terms of demonstrating performance for advanced HTR applications, the experimental failure statistic from manufacture and irradiation testing are significantly below the coated particle requirements specified for PNP and HHT designs at the time. Covering a range to 1300 °C in normal operations and 1600 °C in accidents, with burnups up to 13 % FIMA and fast fluences to 8 × 1025 m− 2 (E > 16 fJ), the results exceed the design limits on manufacturing and operational requirements for the German HTR Modul concept, which were: < 6. 5 × 10 − 5 for manufacturing; < 2 × 10 − 4 for normal operating conditions; and < 5 × 10 − 4 for accident conditions.

In its final construction this nuclear power plant is layed out to produce a total power output of 2870 MW$_{gross}$ with comprising blocks A, Band C; block A of a capacity of 250 MW has been operating since 1967. The area to be supplied {{is located in the}} Federal State of Bavaria, situated to the right and left of the Danube river, and comprises the districts of Dillingen and Günzburg. It involves 8 placesi the total number of population amounts to 55, 000. Maximum straight-line distances from the nuclear power station are around 10 km in north-east direction, and around 15 km in southwest direction. The following was made use of to calculate the heat demand for the area considered:a statistical questionnaire to determine the annual heat consumption and the connection data for residential buildings, official buildings, commercial buildings and industrial plants to be filled in by the various communities; town-maps; the Bavarian Municipal Statistics of 1970 with the results of a building and dwelling census taken on October 25, 1968, results of a non-agricultural workplace census taken on May 27, 1970, and results of a population census taken on May 27, 1970, as weil as a final local inspection. The results show that some places indicate characters that are in favour of district heat supply. However, the heat price is adversely affected by the narrow road configuration in the ancient town centers, the low consumption of heat resulting from the small number of inhabitants, as weil as the large distances from the power station. The advanced projection of blocks B and C does no longer permit a thermodynamically meaningful extraction of heat from the power station, so that the advantage of cheap nuclear heat thus is partly lost again. Added to this is the fact that, due to the activity in the <b>direct-cycle</b> unit of the boilingwater reactor, the heat exchangers for district heat extraction fall into the controlled area, thus eventually impeding the licensing procedure.

40|$|Scoping {{studies for}} a power {{conversion}} {{system based on}} a <b>direct-cycle</b> supercritical water reactor have been conducted. The electric power range of interest is 5 - 30 MWe with a design point of 20 MWe. The overall design objective {{is to develop a}} system that has minimized physical size and performs satisfactorily over a broad range of operating conditions. The design constraints are as follows: Net cycle thermal efficiency {ge} 20 %; Steam turbine outlet quality {ge} 90 %; and Pumping power {le} 2500 kW (at nominal conditions). Three basic cycle configurations were analyzed. Listed in order of increased plant complexity, they are: (1) Simple supercritical Rankine cycle; (2) All-supercritical Brayton cycle; and (3) Supercritical Rankine cycle with feedwater preheating. The sensitivity of these three configurations to various parameters, such as reactor exit temperature, reactor pressure, condenser pressure, etc., was assessed. The Thermoflex software package was used for this task. The results are as follows: (a) The simple supercritical Rankine cycle offers the greatest hardware simplification, but its high reactor temperature rise and reactor outlet temperature may pose serious problems from the viewpoint of thermal stresses, stability and materials in the core. (b) The all-supercritical Brayton cycle is not a contender, due to its poor thermal efficiency. (c) The supercritical Rankine cycle with feedwater preheating affords acceptable thermal efficiency with lower reactor temperature rise and outlet temperature. (d) The use of a moisture separator improves the performance of the supercritical Rankine cycle with feedwater preheating and allows for a further reduction of the reactor outlet temperature, thus it was selected for the next step. Preliminary engineering design of the supercritical Rankine cycle with feedwater preheating and moisture separation was performed. All major components including the turbine, feedwater heater, feedwater pump, condenser, condenser pump and pipes were modeled with realistic assumptions using the PEACE module of Thermoflex. A three-dimensional layout of the plant was also generated with the SolidEdge software. The results of the engineering design are as follows: (i) The cycle achieves a net thermal efficiency of 24. 13 % with 350 / 460 C reactor inlet/outlet temperatures, {approx} 250 bar reactor pressure and 0. 75 bar condenser pressure. The steam quality at the turbine outlet is 90 % and the total electric consumption of the pumps is about 2500 kWe at nominal conditions. (ii) The overall size of the plant is attractively compact and can be further reduced if a printed-circuit-heat-exchanger (vs shell-and-tube) design is used for the feedwater heater, which is currently the largest component by far. Finally, an analysis of the plant performance at off-nominal conditions has revealed good robustness of the design in handling large changes of thermal power and seawater temperature...|$|E
