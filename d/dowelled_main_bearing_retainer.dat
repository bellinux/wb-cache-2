40|$|The active {{magnetic}} bearings {{present a}} new technology which has many advantages compared to traditional bearing designs. Active magnetic <b>bearings,</b> however, require <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings</b> order to prevent damages {{in the event of}} a component, power or a control loop failure. In the dropdown situation, when the rotor drops from the magnetic <b>bearings</b> to the <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings,</b> the design parameters of the <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings</b> have a significant influence on the behaviour of the rotor. In this study, the dynamics of an active magnetic bearings supported electric motor during rotor drop on <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings</b> is studied using a multibody simulation approach. Various design parameters of <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings</b> are studied using a simulation model while results are compared with those found in literature. The <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings</b> are modelled using a detailed ball bearing model, which accounts damping and stiffness properties, oil film and friction between races and rolling elements. The model of the ball bearings includes inertia description of rollingelements. The model of the magnetic bearing system contains unbalances of the rotor and stiffness and damping properties of support. In this study, a computationally efficient contact model between the rotor and the <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings</b> is proposed. In addition, this work introduces information for the design of physicalprototype and its <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings...</b>|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{properties}} of a rotor supported on two passive magnetic bearings are investigated {{by means of}} the numerical solution to the mathemati-cal model of a prototype developed at the Institute of Thermomechanics ASCR. Magnetic supports always have to include the so-called <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings</b> in order to prevent the rotor from dangerous increase of oscilla-tions due to damage in magnetic <b>bearings.</b> <b>Retainer</b> <b>bearings</b> are rolling bearings, the inner ring of which rotates after an oblique impact by the rotor journal. This rotation introduces an additional degree of freedom to the mathematical model of the rotor support. The main aim {{of this study is to}} gain the basic knowledge about the {{properties of}} such a system, the-refore, a new model of impact motion with large amplitudes, introducing radial Hertz stiffness, material contact damping, tangential dry friction and viscous damping is developed.

40|$|The active {{magnetic}} bearings {{have recently}} been intensively developed because of noncontact support having several advantages compared to conventional bearings. Due to improved materials, strategies of control, and electrical components, the performance and reliability of the active magnetic bearings are improving. However, additional <b>bearings,</b> <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings,</b> still have {{a vital role in}} the applications of the active magnetic bearings. The most crucial moment when the <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings</b> are needed is when the rotor drops from the active magnetic <b>bearings</b> on the <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings</b> due to component or power failure. Without appropriate knowledge of the <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings,</b> there is a chance that an active magnetic bearing supported rotor system will be fatal in a drop-down situation. This study introduces a detailed simulation model of a rotor system in order to describe a rotor drop-down situation on the <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings.</b> The introduced simulation model couples a finite element model with component mode synthesis and detailed bearing models. In this study, electrical components and electromechanical forces are not in the focus. The research looks at the theoretical background of the finite element method with component mode synthesis {{that can be used in}} the dynamic analysis of flexible rotors. The <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings</b> are described by using two ball bearing models, which include damping and stiffness properties, oil film, inertia of rolling elements and friction between races and rolling elements. Thefirst bearing model assumes that the cage of the bearing is ideal and that the cage holds the balls in their predefined positions precisely. The second bearing model is an extension of the first model and describes the behavior of the cageless bearing. In the bearing model, each ball is described by using two degrees of freedom. The models introduced in this study are verified with a corresponding actual structure. By using verified bearing models, the effects of the parameters of the rotor system onits dynamics during emergency stops are examined. As shown in this study, the misalignment of the <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings</b> has a significant influence on the behavior of the rotor system in a drop-down situation. In this study, a stability map of the rotor system as a function of rotational speed of the rotor and the misalignment of the <b>retainer</b> <b>bearings</b> is presented. In addition, the effects of parameters of the simulation procedure and the rotor system on the dynamics of system are studied...|$|R

40|$|Volvo Car Corporation uses a new {{generation}} of four cylinder inline engines in their automobiles. The engine family is known as Volvo Engine Architecture and the differences between the different engines are the different power outputs made possible with different engine boosts. The VEA engines utilise a bedplate design for their engines where the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports are casted into the bedplate. For the high performance engines the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports need to be sprayed with an aluminium alloy to get a strong bonding with the bedplate. The spraying is, however, expensive and an alternative solution is sought. Four design proposals, which are based on the current design of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports, were proposed. These design proposals does not use any of the sprayed aluminium alloy material. Instead they have been designed with the goal of getting a mechanical bonding, instead of the chemical bonding that the aluminium alloy coating provides. The design proposals were evaluated by static simulations and dynamic simulations to investigate the influence on the <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> in terms of: • radial deformations of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> profiles, • total pressure and asperity contact pressure and • friction losses. The contact behaviour between the bedplate and the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports, for the different design proposals, at high temperature were also investigated. The results from the simulations were compared to results from earlier work on the sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports. None of the design proposals generally provided lower friction losses compared to the sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> support. The differences in friction loss should also by weighed against the potential cost saving, which is a question for VCC. The sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports showed in general higher asperity contact pressure compared to the design proposals. Most of the bonding between the bedplate and the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports occurred on the top surfaces and the sides of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports for the different design proposals. An investigation of getting fatigue failure in the bedplate should also be considered, if VCC should proceed with {{one or more of the}} design proposals.

5000|$|Crankshafts on six-cylinder engines {{generally}} have either four or seven <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> Larger engines and diesels {{tend to use}} seven bearings because of high loadings and to avoid crankshaft flex. Because of the six-cylinder engine's smooth characteristic, {{there is a tendency}} for a driver to load the engine at low engine speeds. This can produce crankshaft flex in four <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> designs where the crank spans the distance of two cylinders between <b>main</b> <b>bearings.</b> This distance is longer than the distance between two adjacent <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> on a V6 with four mains, because the V6 has cylinder bores on opposite banks which overlap significantly; the overlap may be as high as 100%, minus the width of one connecting rod (1.00" [...] or so).
