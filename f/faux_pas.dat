5|$|In September 1811, William Henry Harrison, then {{governor}} of Indiana Territory, visited Kentucky and directed Colonel Samuel Wells to recruit Kentuckians {{for a new}} federal regiment then being formed by the authority of Secretary of War William Eustis. Harrison had not applied to Scott for permission to recruit in the state, and many Kentuckians– from Scott's political enemy, Humphrey Marshall, to his trusted advisor, Jesse Bledsoe– perceived this as a slight to the governor. Ignoring Bledsoe's indignation, Scott refused to make an issue of the <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> and instead {{became one of the}} staunchest supporters of Harrison's rising career.|$|E
5|$|President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama {{attended}} 10 official inaugural balls {{during the}} evening of January 20, 2009. Barack Obama wore a new tuxedo made by Hart Schaffner Marx, a Chicago-based menswear company. He also wore a white bow tie, instead of the conventional black. Traditionalists considered this a fashion <b>faux</b> <b>pas,</b> as a white tie is conventionally only worn with a white waistcoat and tails. Michelle Obama wore a white, one-shouldered, sleeveless gown designed by 26-year-old NewYork-based designer JasonWu, breaking with the recent practice set by former first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, who showcased designers from their hometowns.|$|E
5|$|Barry John {{was born}} in Cefneithin, Carmarthenshire in Wales. He was educated at Gwendraeth Grammar School in the Gwendraeth Valley, north of Llanelli. He {{attended}} Cefenithin Primary, {{and there he was}} fortunate to receive skilled rugby teaching. The headmaster, William John Jones, and teacher Ray Williams, were both former Wales international rugby players. Despite his natural talents, he never played at schoolboy level for Wales, but represented both his school and his local village team, Cefneithin RFC. He once played a game for rival team Pontyberem while still a schoolboy, but John recalls in his autobiography that the local resentment at making such a sporting <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> ensured he never did so again. While still a teenager attending grammar school, he made his first top-flight rugby appearance for Llanelli, on 4 January 1964 in an encounter with Moseley. Although Llanelli lost the encounter, John scored a try and converted it, and played in four more matches for the Llanelli senior team {{towards the end of the}} season. He continued to represent Llanelli while at Trinity College, Carmarthen, and gained a reputation as a kicking fly-half with a penchant for putting over dropped goals. During the 1964/65 season, John began to make an impact on the Welsh club scene. His dropped goal against Aberavon on 26 October 1964, only 17games in, was his 11th of the season.|$|E

25|$|Cheryl {{is tired}} of Larry not working, so he begins {{to develop a new}} {{television}} show, initially with guest stars Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (George and Elaine, respectively, on Seinfeld) as themselves. But Larry's constant social <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> ruin the chances of the show being financed by a major television network.|$|E
25|$|Godfrey {{appeared}} on every major magazine cover including Life, Look, Time, {{and over a}} dozen TV Guide covers. He {{was also the first}} man to ever make the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine. Despite his <b>faux</b> <b>pas,</b> Godfrey still commanded a strong presence and a loyal fan base. Talent Scouts lasted until 1958.|$|E
25|$|Block {{was also}} in the habit of asking an {{attractive}} contestant for her phone number, or in one case, even chasing a female contestant around the desk à la Harpo Marx. Although Block intended these <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> as humor, What's My Line? had built a large segment of their audience which was conservative and regarded it as inappropriate.|$|E
25|$|O'Kelly {{left the}} cabinet in 1945 {{when he was}} elected President of Ireland in a popular vote of the people, {{defeating}} two other candidates. O'Kelly's most famous <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> occurred during a state visit to the Vatican, when in a breach with standard protocol, he told the media of Pope Pius XII's personal opinions on communism. The resulting row strained relationships between Pope Pius and Joseph Stalin.|$|E
25|$|In November 2009, King Abdullah was {{received}} by Nicolas Sarkozy, who committed various diplomatic <b>faux</b> <b>pas.</b> The diplomatic relationship Jacques Chirac had with Saudi Arabia was not evident with Sarkozy. In January 2011, the Kingdom granted asylum to the ousted Tunisian leader, Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, {{under conditions of}} no further political involvement. According to leaked cables, King Abdullah was more receptive than Crown Prince Sultan to former Yemeni President Saleh.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been {{high-profile}} failures and <b>faux</b> <b>pas.</b> Amazon.com was criticized for irrational price changes that resulted from a revenue management software bug. The Coca-Cola Company's plans for a dynamic pricing vending machine were put on hold {{as a result of}} negative consumer reactions. Revenue management is also blamed for much of the financial difficulty currently experienced by legacy carriers. The reliance of the major carriers on high fares in captive markets arguably created the conditions for low cost carriers to thrive.|$|E
25|$|After his {{pit stop}} <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> on lap 44, Rubens Barrichello was disqualified from sixth {{position}} after the race's conclusion. Barrichello was penalized by the race stewards, having exited the pit lane while the red lights were illuminated. The Brazilian's pitstop {{was also the}} first of various instances throughout the season of drivers having to pit under stabilised safety car conditions. In the race classification, this moved Nakajima up into sixth position, Sébastien Bourdais into seventh and reigning champion Räikkönen into the final point-scoring position in eighth.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a series}} of vignettes recounting a social {{occasion}} during which someone said something that should not have been said, or an awkward occurrence. The participant's task is to identify what was said that was awkward, why it was awkward, how people would have felt in reaction to the <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> and to a factual control question. Although first designed for use in people on the autism spectrum, the test is also sensitive to patients with OFC dysfunction, who cannot judge when something socially awkward has happened despite appearing to understand the story perfectly well.|$|E
25|$|The {{plots and}} subplots of the episodes are {{established}} in an outline written by David, and the dialogue is largely improvised by the actors (a technique known as retroscripting). As with Seinfeld, which David co-created, {{the subject matter}} in Curb Your Enthusiasm often involves the minutiae of American daily social life, and plots often revolve around Larry David's many <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> and his problems with certain social conventions and expectations, {{as well as his}} annoyance with other people's behavior. The character has a hard time letting such annoyances go unexpressed, which often leads him into awkward situations. He is also routinely the victim of elaborate misunderstandings wherein other characters believe that he has done something morally terrible or disgusting.|$|E
25|$|One common <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> on Internet forums is to {{post the}} same message twice. Users {{sometimes}} post versions of a message that are only slightly different, especially in forums where {{they are not allowed}} to edit their earlier posts. Multiple posting instead of editing prior posts can artificially inflate a user's post count. Multiple posting can be unintentional; a user's browser might display an error message even though the post has been transmitted or a user of a slow forum might become impatient and repeatedly hit the submit button. An offline editor may post {{the same message}} twice. Multiple posting can also be used as a method of trolling or spreading forum spam. A user may also send the same post to several forums, which is termed crossposting. The term derives from Usenet, where crossposting was an accepted practice but causes problems in web forums, which lack the ability to link such posts so replies in one forum are not visible to people reading the post in other forums.|$|E
25|$|A {{previous}} negative social {{experience can}} be a trigger to social phobia, perhaps particularly for individuals high in 'interpersonal sensitivity'. For around half of those diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, a specific traumatic or humiliating social event appears {{to be associated with}} the onset or worsening of the disorder; this kind of event appears to be particularly related to specific (performance) social phobia, for example regarding public speaking (Stemberg et al., 1995). As well as direct experiences, observing or hearing about the socially negative experiences of others (e.g. a <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> committed by someone), or verbal warnings of social problems and dangers, may also make the development of a social anxiety disorder more likely. Social anxiety disorder may be caused by the longer-term effects of not fitting in, or being bullied, rejected or ignored (Beidel and Turner, 1998). Shy adolescents or avoidant adults have emphasised unpleasant experiences with peers or childhood bullying or harassment (Gilmartin, 1987). In one study, popularity was found to be negatively correlated with social anxiety, and children who were neglected by their peers reported higher social anxiety and fear of negative evaluation than other categories of children. Socially phobic children appear less likely to receive positive reactions from peers and anxious or inhibited children may isolate themselves.|$|E
25|$|The Law of April 6, 1830 of Mexico {{had been}} passed to stop the tide of Anglo {{immigration}} into the country, hoping to safeguard against the annexation of Texas by the United States. The state government of Coahuila y Tejas sent Carbajal and Jose Francisco Madero to conduct land grant surveys in East Texas in January 1831, for settlers who had been residing outside the authority of any other empresario grants prior to 1828. A confrontation about the granting of the titles arose between Madero and Mexican Colonel Juan Davis Bradburn, who was the military governor over Galveston Bay. After correspondence disputing Madero's authority to make the surveys, and Madero's <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> of not making a courtesy call to discuss the issue, Bradburn issued a directive on February 13, instructing Madero to meet with him. When Madero ignored that order, Bradburn immediately arrested both Madero and Carbajal. The two remained incarcerated for ten days. They were released, pending Bradburn's receiving further direction from Mexico City. Madero and Carbajal resumed their surveying, filing sixty completed land titles. On April 12, the government in Saltillo sent Madero orders to stop surveying in Bradburn's territory, but the work had already been completed by that date.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} conquering Jiankang, Hou {{essentially}} only controlled the nearby areas. The {{rest of the}} Liang dynasty lands were {{under the control of}} members of the imperial clan. Their squabbling amongst themselves weakened their efforts to defeat Hou. In the end, Xiao Yi with the aid of his generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian defeated Hou, crowning himself Emperor Yuan of Liang. His brother Xiao Ji based in Sichuan was still a major threat. Emperor Yuan asked for assistance from Western Wei to defeat Xiao Ji, but after subduing Xiao Ji, they kept Sichuan. Due to a diplomatic <b>faux</b> <b>pas,</b> he incited the anger of Yuwen Tai, the leading general of Western Wei, which resulted in him being deposed and dying. Western Wei set up the puppet state of Western Liang with capital at Jiangling. Northern Qi also had designs on the Liang throne and sent an expedition under the banner of a cousin of Emperor Yuan. Chen Baxian and Wang Sengbian set up the last surviving son of Emperor Yuan, Xiao Fangzhi, as Liang ruler, but he was not given the imperial title. After some defeats to the forces of Northern Qi, Wang Sengbian allowed their pretender, Xiao Yuanming to establish himself as Emperor Min of Liang. However, Chen Baxian was displeased with the arrangements, and in a surprise move killed Wang and deposed Emperor Min in favor of Xiao Fangzhi who became Emperor Jing of Liang. After a short reign, Chen deposed Emperor Jing and took power himself as Emperor Wu of Chen in 557.|$|E
500|$|Wikipedia policy warned users not to edit {{their own}} {{biography}} pages, with its rules on autobiographical editing quoting Wales: [...] "It {{is a social}} <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> to write about yourself." [...] Larry Sanger said, [...] "It does seem that Jimmy is attempting to rewrite history", and began a discussion on the talk page of Wales' biography about historical revisionism.|$|E
500|$|The {{reasons given}} for the administrators' disinclination towards Nash include his {{reputation}} for blunt speech, his abrasive personality, which included sledging and even {{the fact that he}} wore cut off sleeves, which was considered a serious <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> in the 1930s. [...] Nash himself believed it was due to his working-class background, saying [...] "I didn't wear the old school tie. I was a working man's son. I didn't fit in".|$|E
500|$|Gallagher is {{well known}} for his controversial, outspoken {{statements}} in the press; he acknowledged his tendency for <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> in the song [...] "My Big Mouth" [...] on the album Be Here Now. Yet Gallagher has defended himself, saying [...] "people think [...] controversial for the answers [...] give to silly questions in interviews, but... I'm not thinking about insulting... people; I say what I genuinely feel is in my heart. My conscience is clean, d'you know what I mean? Y'know, I'm true to myself—fuck everybody else." ...|$|E
500|$|While a Professor of Comparative Literature at Princeton University, Michael Goldman {{presented}} his view on defining the elusive quality of Chekhov's comedies stating: [...] "Having learned that Chekhov is comic... Chekhov is comic {{in a very}} special, paradoxical way. His plays depend, as comedy does, on {{the vitality of the}} actors to make pleasurable what would otherwise be painfully awkward – inappropriate speeches, missed connections, <b>faux</b> <b>pas,</b> stumbles, childishness – but as part of a deeper pathos; the stumbles are not pratfalls but an energized, graceful dissolution of purpose." ...|$|E
500|$|The actors improvise their {{dialogue}} {{based on}} the story outline, direction, and their own creativity. David has said that his character in the show, a fictionalized version of himself, is what he would be like in real life if he lacked social awareness and sensitivity. The character's numerous and frequent social <b>faux</b> <b>pas,</b> misunderstandings, and ironic coincidences are the basis {{of much of the}} show's comedy and have led to the entry into the American pop culture lexicon of the expression [...] "Larry David moment", meaning an inadvertently created socially awkward situation.|$|E
500|$|While the {{marriage}} was based on warmth and esteem on Rosebery's side and adoration on Hannah's, it seems that Rosebery often found his wife's devotion irritating, and this sometimes caused him to be impatient with her. He was often abrupt with her in public. She, by contrast, was completely enraptured by him, and would frequently ignore her neighbours {{at a dinner party}} to listen to her husband's conversation further down the table, a <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> almost considered a crime in Victorian society. Those who saw the couple alone at home [...] "could not doubt the affection as well as the comprehension that united them." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing Captain Dumitriu's suicide attempt, John Simon writes: [...] "It is {{visually}} stunning {{and emotionally}} shattering, {{but it may}} be a bit too theatrical. Still, with such writing, directing, and acting—most prominently from Kristin Scott-Thomas and Claudiu Bleonţ as the Dumitrius, but also from the rest—what is a small <b>faux</b> <b>pas?</b> This film resonates in the memory, insistently and inspiredly." [...] Simon also discusses the cinematography, arguing that Călin Ghibu's use of lighting manages to convey the [...] "almost unearthly beauty at sunset", which helps viewers understand why Scott Thompson's character uses Mount Fuji as her preferred metaphor for the place. Of this aspect, James notes: [...] "Like its heroine, the film's serene and beautiful appearance masks a powerful conscience." ...|$|E
500|$|That {{year was}} {{generally}} difficult, {{as the economy}} worsened. After ruffling feathers at the Milan shows in February, the April issue's cover image of LeBron James and Gisele Bündchen brought criticism for its evocation of racial stereotypes. The next month a lavish Karl Lagerfeld gown she wore to the Met's Costume Institute Gala was called [...] "the worst fashion <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> of 2008." [...] In the fall, Vogue Living was suspended indefinitely, and Men's Vogue cut back to two issues a year as an outsert or supplement to the women's magazine. At {{the end of the}} year, December's cover highlighted a disparaging comment Jennifer Aniston made about Angelina Jolie, to the former's displeasure; media observers began speculating that Wintour had lost her touch.|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer Schilling {{called the}} self-referential {{nature of the}} release a [...] "very postmodern conceit", which he thought worked well despite the dual <b>faux</b> <b>pas</b> of parodying The Matrix and overtly [...] "satirizing game mechanics". He felt that the satire was not good, though the writing was [...] "genuinely funny", and that the {{repeated}} Dominatrix fight scenes should not have felt as low budget. He recommended the pack for those who love [...] "wry gags about creaky gaming tropes with the occasional belly laugh", {{and said he had}} a better time finding his own fun than playing through the missions. Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly noted that those who are looking for cost benefit would be disappointed by lack of content, especially those who had already finished the main game, but he was interested in Enter the Dominatrix for its behind-the-scenes aspects, which he encouraged other developers to use more often.|$|E

It's not every toon that deals with midlife crisis, marital dysfunction, child neglect, {{impotence}} fears, fashion <b>faux</b> <b>pas,</b> and existential angst." [...] The National Review Online named The Incredibles no. 2 on its list of the 25 best conservative movies of the last 25 years, saying that it [...] "celebrates marriage, courage, responsibility, and high achievement." [...] Entertainment Weekly named the film No. 25 on its list of the 25 greatest action films ever and no. 7 on its list of the 20 best animated movies ever. IGN ranked the film as the third favorite animated film of all time in a list published in 2010. In 2012, film critic Matt Zoller Seitz declared The Incredibles as the greatest superhero film he has ever seen: [...] "That thing works as a James Bond spoof; a meditation on identities, secret and otherwise; a domestic comedy; a statement on exceptionalism vs. mediocrity, and the perils of the nanny state… And yet it all hangs together. No part feels perfunctory or stupid. It’s all deeply felt." [...] He would also later name the film as the [...] "greatest action movie of the aughts, with [...] and [...] following close behind." ...|$|E
500|$|The factory {{supervisor}} belatedly {{realizes that}} the gender disparity is impairing morale and productivity, so he arranges for an army officer to organize military maneuvers near the town {{in order for the}} factory to sponsor a big dance, at which the workers can find male companionship among the soldiery. [...] "They need what we needed when we were young", he explains to a sympathetic officer. Anticipation runs high on both sides, with the girls expecting to meet the young men of their dreams, while the recruits, many of whom are actually middle-aged reservists, out-of-shape and already married, look forward to a night of revelry and seduction. The night of the party is a disappointment for some members of both groups; Andula and her friends are repulsed by the unappealing soldiers, whom they call [...] "old buffers", and a trio of reservists are so nonplussed by the situation that they commit a series of comic <b>faux</b> <b>pas,</b> like sending a bottle of wine to the wrong table and dropping a wedding ring that one of them is trying to hide, only to watch it roll across the floor and land {{at the feet of the}} young women who are the objects of their lust. [...] For these people, the mixer is a huge flop, with the girls retiring to the lavatory to devise a way to escape their pursuers and the aging reservists arguing with each other over expenses (one points out that [...] "you can only get it [...] free at home") and speculating on the necessity of going to the woods in order to consummate their romantic plans ("Imagine, in this weather!"). For others, however, the dance is a success: the factory supervisor looks on in smug satisfaction as couples throng the crowded dance floor, one girl holds her hands together in a gesture showing her delight and gratitude when she is asked to dance, while an obese, balding soldier capers with a mismatched tall, thin brunette, both clearly having the time of their lives.|$|E
