The range of the study covers from the sub-monolayer (sub-ML) regime to the later stage where film thickness amounts to a few thousand MLs; it also covers epitaxial breakdown in which epitaxial growth is no longer sustained and the growing phase becomes amorphous. First, we have conducted a systematic investigation of the phase shift of the RHEED intensity oscillations during Ge(001) <b>homoepitaxy</b> MBE {{for a wide range}} of diffraction conditions. We conclude that the phase shift is caused by the overlap of the specular spot and the Kikuchi features, in contrast to models involving dynamical scattering theory for the phase shift.

40|$|The <b>homoepitaxy</b> and the Xe"+ {{ion beam}} erosion of Pt(111) were {{investigated}} with a {{scanning tunneling microscope}} (STM). Besides the high resolution of the STM the very low base pressure was fundamental for the investigations. The experiments concerning <b>homoepitaxy</b> of Pt can be devided in three parts. The first part deals with films with a thickness of less than 5 monolayers deposited under very clean conditions (P_t_o_t #<=# 2. 10 "-" 1 " 1 mbar, P_C_O #approx# 5. 10 "-" 1 " 2 mbar). Island densities and shapes {{as well as the}} growth mode were investigated in the temperature range between 200 K and 600 K. The results are compared to previous measurements. The effective step barrier estimated at 400 K appears to depend strongly on the island shape. The very clean deposition conditions were obtained by using a new designed evaporator consisting of a Pt wire heated resistively. The construction allows the heating of the Pt wire, while keeping most of the other components close to room temperature. The absence of the usually used electron beam prevents the formation of ions and thus the increase of the background CO-pressure. A second group of experiments deals with the influence of minute amounts of CO on Pt(111) <b>homoepitaxy.</b> The main difference between Pt islands grown on Pt(111) in the temperature range 350 K- 450 K with and without additional CO resides {{in the nature of the}} steps bordering the islands. The change from A to B steps occures at CO coverages of a few thousandths of a monolayer. Also the other aspects of the growth process like island density and step edge barrier are influenced by minute amounts of CO. (orig.) 146 refs.

40|$|We {{study in}} this paper the elastic {{interaction}} between modulated steps, in both <b>homoepitaxy</b> and heteroepitaxy. The influence of this interaction on the step fluctuation spectrum is discussed. There are two important consequences that emanate from our analysis, i) in the <b>homoepitaxy</b> case the elastic interaction favors a modulated step profile. However, the gain in the elastic interaction does not generally overcome the line tension effect and ii) more importantly, for the heteroepitaxial case the elastic contribution to the energy modulation is of the same order {{as that of the}} line tension part. Elasticity results in an effective line tension (but singular), which may be either positive or negative depending on the phase shift between two adjacent steps. This analysis shows that the elastic contribution for non-zero wavevectors should be incorporated in any statistical theory of fluctuating steps, if one wants to account properly for experimental observations. We point out similarities between this problem, and others arising in quite different systems. We suggest that, in general, tensorial (dipolar and multipolar) interactions between lines, surfaces, etc. of electrostatic, magnetic, hydrodynamic, etc. nature, should lead to the same generic behaviour...|$|E
