500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{influence}} that the apparent death of Steve Rogers has on Carter, Atwell explained that [...] "It's only been a year and she's grieving him and I think what keeps her going is he was the greatest person she ever knew ... she's also determined {{to make sure that}} his work wasn't in vain." [...] Following the first season, Atwell noted that Carter did not [...] "win everyone’s respect", with Jack Thompson taking credit for her actions, for example, but [...] "she knows her value so she doesn’t need that praise". For the second season, executive producer Michele Fazekas explained that after Carter [...] "put a lot of things emotionally to bed", such as letting go of Captain America, she is now [...] "more open to looking at her life and figuring out, <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> a relationship?" [...] Fazekas added that Carter would start to realize that [...] "not everybody has her ideals", even in the SSR.|$|E
6000|$|TARLETON. I {{understand}} the oranges: shes doing an orange cure of some sort. But {{what on earth}} <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> the Bible for? ...|$|E
6000|$|If Mr. Longdon breathed rather hard {{it seemed}} to show at least that he followed. [...] "What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> of a good conscience?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Who was <b>she?</b> What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want?</b> Whence <b>did</b> <b>she</b> come? What was {{the horror}} she {{revealed}} to {{the night in the}} bower of Christabel? ...|$|R
6000|$|Was Emma's mind {{disengaged}} {{enough for}} curiosity, or <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> {{to quit the}} subject! She said--'You have had a trial of this kind yourself?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, she {{was always}} so," [...] said Minver. [...] "When a thing was to be <b>done,</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> it <b>done</b> like lightning, {{no matter what the}} thing was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How much <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> you to have?" [...] I asked, laughing. [...] "She {{ought to}} fix the sum, so that I may stay till it's made up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, God {{bless the}} girl, what <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> me to say? And as for joking, surely that is {{innocent}} enough. You're as tender about the doctor {{as though he}} were a girl of seventeen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Merril! What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> here?" [...] said old Leeson, {{who usually}} spoke {{somewhat}} loudly, {{in what he}} evidently fancied was an aside, {{and it seemed to}} Jimmy that his sister's eyes asked the same question.|$|E
6000|$|... "What was {{all that}} noise just now?" [...] he growled peevishly, without looking up. [...] "Confound you and your mother! What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want?</b> What <b>did</b> you come out for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I don't {{think he}} <b>did.</b> <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to dance with}} him again bad enough, I know. Everybody does with Dick, because he's so {{handsome}} and such a clever courter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No one you know. But {{she used}} to go about with her brows knit trying not to <b>do</b> {{whatever}} <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to do--if ever <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> to do anything--" ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{carriage}} slowly {{passed the}} window, and Havill recognized the Power liveries. 'Hullo--she's coming here!' he said under his breath, as the carriage {{stopped by the}} kerb. 'What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want,</b> I wonder? Dare, does she know you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Herr Paul {{raising his}} brows till his glasses fell from his nose: [...] "And what says Gretchen? <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> {{to be handed}} up to posterities a little peacock {{along with the other}} little birds?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} loving her dearly. They were intimate, and Mrs. Finn {{used to be}} with her very much {{when she was in the}} country. She was at Matching just now, when my poor mother died. Why <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> to see you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> to find Mr. Otter? She had {{inherited}} {{much of the}} old cutter's independence. How much better {{it would be if}} she could find work and support herself without calling on him for aid! ...|$|R
2500|$|Florence Conybeare was {{actively}} involved in fundraising in Dartford during the First World War. [...] "As the grim reality developed in France, an appeal went out from Florence Conybeare, to 'all Florence's'. Her plan was {{to raise money to}} purchase and equip an ambulance which would be sent to the Western Front which would be used to move wounded British soldiers—referred to as [...] "the devoted sons of our Empire" [...] on —from the battlegrounds back to the field hospitals. Not only <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> this <b>done,</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> volunteers called [...] "Florences" [...] to [...] "man" [...] the ambulance in France! She managed to raise the money, but she never got her wish to man the ambulance with Florence's.|$|R
60|$|That {{was just}} what <b>she</b> didn't <b>want!</b> The light from the window was that horrid vulgar red glow which she hated. It might be very romantic and suit lovers like Jack, but as SHE had some work to <b>do,</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> the blue shade of the lamp to correct that dreadful glare.|$|R
6000|$|Henrietta {{opened her}} eyes, and gazed upon her {{without saying a}} word for some moments; then, as her senses awakened, she half sprung up. [...] "How is mamma? <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> me? Why?" [...] Her aunt made an effort to speak, but it seemed beyond her power.|$|E
6000|$|MARY. Who is she? What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> with him? And he ... {{where is}} he? Do {{you know that}} my father is dead, and the Deacon not here? Where has he gone? He may be dead, too. Father, brother ... O God, {{it is more than}} I can bear! ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{stopped a}} moment {{and looked at his}} {{companion}} steadily. [...] "It's rather a curious thing that, when I suggested she might like a run over to Barrock-holme, she didn't seem to want to go. And there's another point that's puzzling me. When I mention the crescent or the pearls, why <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> to change the subject?" ...|$|E
60|$|Why had {{she left}} Sabbath-school? Why? Oh, yes. What did he (McSnagley) {{want to tell}} her she was wicked for? What did he tell her that God hated her for? If God hated her, what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> to go to Sabbath school for? <b>She</b> didn't <b>want</b> to be beholden to anybody who hated her.|$|R

6000|$|What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> want--what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want?</b> Her mother {{once said}} to her, with that {{characteristic}} touch of irony: 'Well, dear, if it is your fate to consider the lilies, that toil not, neither do they spin, that is one destiny among many others, and perhaps not so unpleasant as most. Why do you take it amiss, my child?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can it be Phoebe?" [...] {{questioned}} she within herself. [...] "It must {{be little}} Phoebe; {{for it can}} be nobody else,--and there is a look of her father about her, too! But what <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> here? And how like a country cousin, to come down upon a poor body in this way, {{without so much as}} a day's notice, or asking whether she would be welcome! Well; she must have a night's lodging, I suppose; and to-morrow the child shall go back to her mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If she {{had told}} me the moment she got here," [...] Mrs. Assingham replied, [...] "I shouldn't have my {{difficulty}} in finding out. But she wasn't so obliging, and I see no sign at all of her becoming so. What's certain is that she didn't come for nothing. She wants"-- she worked it out at her leisure--"to see the Prince again. THAT isn't what troubles me. I mean that such a fact, as a fact, isn't. But what I ask myself is, What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> it FOR?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know what}} to do!' said Sol, walking up and down. 'If half what I have heard is true, I would lose a winter's work to prevent her marrying him. What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> to go mixing in with people who despise her for? Now look here, Mr. Mountclere, since you have been and called me out to talk this over, it is only fair that you should tell me the exact truth about your brother. Is it a lie, or is it true, {{that he is not}} fit to be the husband of a decent woman?' ...|$|E
6000|$|On Saturday morning Soames {{had found}} her at her writing-table with a note written to Swithin, putting him off. Why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> to put him off? he asked. She might put her own people off when she liked, {{he would not have}} her putting off his people! ...|$|R
60|$|A {{quick change}} came over her. She mistrusted herself, she mistrusted the outer world. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not <b>want</b> to go on, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not <b>want</b> {{to go out}} into it, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to go no further.|$|R
6000|$|Geoffrey {{observed}} {{her from}} the dining-room, on {{her way down the}} stairs. He waited to see what <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> before he showed himself, and spoke to her. Instead of going on into the kitchen, she stopped short, and entered the parlor. Another suspicious circumstance! What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> in the parlor, without a candle, at that time of night? ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{direction}} in which she turned prevented her from seeing me. She was quite unaware that I had discovered her; and I have said nothing about it since. But I noticed something unusual {{in the manner in}} which her watch-chain was hanging, and I asked her what o'clock it was. She said, [...] "You have got your own watch." [...] I told her my watch had stopped. [...] "So has mine," [...] she said. There is no doubt about it now; she has pawned her watch. What for? She lives here for nothing, and she has not had a new dress since I have known her. Why <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> money? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Tavernake," [...] she murmured, [...] "do {{you know}} that you are not in the least kind to me? Beatrice and I are sisters, after all. Even she has {{admitted}} that. She left me most unkindly at a critical time in my life; she misunderstood things; if I were to see her, I could explain everything. I feel it very much that she is living apart from me in this city where we are both strangers. I am anxious about her, Mr. Tavernake. <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> money? If so, will you take her some from me? Can't you suggest any way in which I could help her? Do be my friend, please, and advise me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, you know; if you've got {{anything}} {{to say that you}} don't think very acceptable you had better say it to ME." [...] Gaston changed colour, but his reply was checked by Delia's quick return. She brought the news that her sister would be obliged if he would go into the little dining-room--he would find her there. She had something for his ear that she could mention only in private. It was very comfortable; there was a lamp and a fire. [...] "Well, I guess she CAN take care of herself!" [...] Mr. Dosson, at this, commented with a laugh. [...] "What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> to say to him?" [...] he asked when Gaston had passed out.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it wasn't. The {{girl was}} carried out of herself. She is somehow enslaved by Clarke, and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> help. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> to be investigated; but <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> it <b>done</b> privately. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> you to <b>do</b> it. <b>She</b> begs you to do it." ...|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth, on her side, {{had much}} to <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{ascertain}} the feelings of each of her visitors; <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.|$|R
