Because of its scarcity, bread that had dried was made into a pudding known as boyos de pan.|$|E

25|$|As of 1920, Antalya was {{reported}} {{as having a}} population of approximately 30,000. The harbor was described as small, and unsafe for vessels to visit in the winter.

The latter two were often exported to Egypt and other goods to Italy or other Greek islands, who received mainly <b>flour.</b> <b>In</b> 1920, the city had seven flour mills. Wheat was imported, and then processed in town before exportation. Antalya imported manufactured items, mainly from the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Cultivation of azuki beans {{dates back}} to ancient times {{according}} to an excavation from Odong-ri, Hoeryong, North Hamgyong Province, which {{is assumed to be}} that of Mumun period (approximately 1500-300 BCE). Azuki beans are generally eaten as patbap, which is a bowl of rice mixed with the beans, or as a filling and covering for tteok (rice cake) and breads. A porridge made with azuki beans, called patjuk, is commonly eaten during the winter season. On Dongjinal, a Korean traditional holiday which falls on December 22, Korean people eat donji patjuk, which contains saealsim (새알심), a ball made from glutinous rice <b>flour.</b> <b>In</b> old Korean tradition, patjuk is believed to have the power to drive evil spirits away.|$|E
25|$|The {{main problem}} with the food rations {{is that they do}} not {{necessarily}} provide the elements necessary for a basic diet. Furthermore it is insensitive to cultural differences and household needs, leading to refugees considering food assistance as degrading – where they are expected to be grateful for inappropriate provisions. Moreover, when, as is frequent, WFP is unable to provide all of these staples, the calories are distributed through whatever commodity is available. There have been times when all of the 1900 calories (i.e. before it was increased to 2,100) were supplied in maize <b>flour.</b> <b>In</b> 1997, refugees had not received any beans or lentils for eight weeks, their only potential source of protein.|$|E
25|$|Libyan cuisine derives {{much from}} the traditions of Mediterranean, North African, and Berber cuisines. One {{of the most popular}} Libyan dishes is Bazin, an unleavened bread {{prepared}} with barley, water and salt. Bazin is prepared by boiling barley <b>flour</b> <b>in</b> water and then beating it to create a dough using a magraf, which is a unique stick designed for this purpose. Pork consumption is forbidden, in accordance with Sharia, the religious laws of Islam. Tripoli is Libya's capital, and the cuisine is particularly influenced by Italian cuisine. Pasta is common, and many seafood dishes are available. Southern Libyan cuisine is more traditionally Arab and Berber. Common fruits and vegetables include figs, dates, oranges, apricots and olives.|$|E

25|$|The Confederate {{government}} initially {{wanted to}} finance its war mostly through tariffs on imports, export taxes, and voluntary donations of gold. After the spontaneous imposition of an embargo on cotton sales to Europe in 1861, these sources of revenue dried {{up and the}} Confederacy increasingly turned to issuing debt and printing {{money to pay for}} war expenses. The Confederate States politicians were worried about angering the general population with hard taxes. A tax increase might disillusion many Southerners, so the Confederacy resorted to printing more money. As a result, inflation increased and remained a problem for the southern states {{throughout the rest of the}} war. By April 1863, for example, the cost of <b>flour</b> <b>in</b> Richmond had risen to $100 a barrel and housewives were rioting.|$|E
25|$|P. sericea is {{a species}} that is {{historically}} and culturally significant to the Pankararé Indians who live in northwest Brazil. They have developed a folk taxonomy of many social bees and wasps that inhabit the area. Polybia sericea is classified as a fierce wasp {{that is likely to}} bite more than once. This classification contrasts with other findings that describe this species as docile, and not aggressive unless provoked. The Pankararé often roast the combs of Polybia sericea larvae, and then extract them to be eaten alone or mixed with manioc <b>flour.</b> <b>In</b> addition, they use this species in their healing practices. A bath of smoke from burning the nests of Polybia sericea is used to treat evil eye and stroke.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, folic acid {{has begun to}} be added to fortify <b>flour</b> <b>in</b> many countries, so folate {{deficiency}} is now more rare. At the same time, since DNA synthetic-sensitive tests for anemia and erythrocyte size are routinely done in even simple medical test clinics (so that these folate-mediated biochemical effects are more often directly detected), the MTR-dependent effects of B12 deficiency are becoming apparent not as anemia due to DNA-synthetic problems (as they were classically), but now mainly as a simple and less obvious elevation of homocysteine in the blood and urine (homocysteinuria). This condition may result in long term damage to arteries and in clotting (stroke and heart attack), but this effect is difficult to separate from other common processes associated with atherosclerosis and aging.|$|E

40|$|The {{jackfruit}} (Artocarpus heterophyllus) and durian (Durio zibethinus) seeds contain high {{portion of}} amylose, {{which makes them}} potential materials for biodegradable films. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop biodegradable films composed of jackfruit and durian seed flours and glycerol as plasticizer. The films were prepared by dispersing <b>flours</b> <b>in</b> water, adding glycerol, heating the mixture, casting the solution on an acrylic plate, and drying the films at 50 ºC for 20 hours. Glycerol contributes to the flexibility of the film, while reduces the strength of the film. The Young’s modulus, tensile strength, and elongation at break increase as the ratio of jackfruit to durian seed flour increases. The films made from jackfruit and durian seed <b>flours</b> <b>in</b> this work are stronger than the film made from rice flour obtained by other researcher. Therefore, jackfruit and durian seed flours are potential raw material for biodegradable films...|$|R

In 1806 their first child was born, William Jr. Two years later they moved to a part of the building where the shop was where he was working as a clockcase-maker. Munroe also made some furniture, besides clockcases, which he took to Boston to sell. In 1810 he traded some clocks in Norfolk for some corn and flour. He traded the flour to a Mr. Prescott, a baker in Concord, in a round about way for a shop at the Concord Mill-Dam Company that Mr. Prescott owned. There was a credit crunch in the economy at this time and Mr. Prescott didn't have cash to pay for the <b>flour.</b> <b>In</b> 1811 Munroe moved his family to a small house closer to his shop.|$|E
