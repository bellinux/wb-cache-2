5|$|Crime and Punishment {{focuses on}} the mental anguish and moral <b>dilemmas</b> <b>of</b> Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous {{pawnbroker}} for her cash. Raskolnikov, {{in an attempt to}} defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of such actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.|$|E
5|$|Other {{texts that}} include Krishna {{such as the}} Bhagavad Gita have {{attracted}} numerous bhasya (commentaries) in the Hindu traditions. Though {{only a part of}} the Hindu epic Mahabharata, it has functioned as an independent spiritual guide. It allegorically raises through Krishna and Arjuna the ethical and moral <b>dilemmas</b> <b>of</b> human life, then presents a spectrum of answers, weighing in on the ideological questions on human freedoms, choices, and responsibilities towards self and towards others. This Krishna dialogue has attracted numerous interpretations, from being a metaphor of inner human struggle teaching non-violence, to being a metaphor of outer human struggle teaching a rejection of quietism to persecution.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity {{is one of}} the <b>dilemmas</b> <b>of</b> sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E

This article evaluates the bases for ASEAN and demonstrates that ASEAN has reasons to stay strong as regional cooperation. Rather than denying tensions, this article agrees that there are tensions among members but it also recognizes such challenge {{as the one that}} unites ASEAN members together. There are some <b>dilemmas</b> among members <b>of</b> ASEAN that does not left much room for members but to cooperate with each other: the <b>dilemma</b> <b>of</b> risking higher tensions among members, the <b>dilemma</b> <b>of</b> risking the benefits of existing pooling <b>of</b> resources, the <b>dilemma</b> <b>of</b> improving connectivity among members and the <b>dilemma</b> <b>of</b> facing global pressure on good governance and liberal democracy. ...|$|R

5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the <b>dilemmas</b> <b>of</b> sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E

25|$|Rama {{was born}} to Kaushalya and Dasharatha in Ayodhya, the ruler of the Kingdom of Kosala. His {{siblings}} included Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna. He married Sita. Though born in a royal family, their life is described in the Hindu texts as one challenged by unexpected changes such as an exile into impoverished and difficult circumstances, ethical questions and moral <b>dilemmas.</b> <b>Of</b> all their travails, the most notable is the kidnapping of Sita by demon-king Ravana, followed by the determined and epic efforts of Rama and Lakshmana to gain her freedom and destroy the evil Ravana against great odds. The entire life story of Rama, Sita and their companions allegorically discusses duties, rights and social responsibilities of an individual. It illustrates dharma and dharmic living through model characters.|$|E

25|$|The unique {{contribution}} Ralya {{has made}} to the Bahá'í Faith in fiction is that her works center on the moral <b>dilemmas</b> <b>of</b> modern society {{in the west and}} spiritual insights and development that reflect an understanding of the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith in response to these challenges. On the one hand she has envisioned an attainable utopia (that is, not completely perfect) with specifics based on suggestions made in writings of the Bahá'í Faith. A particularly strong analysis is made of marital fidelity vs the divine law against adultery vs intense love and friendship {{between a man and a}} woman not married, though many topics are addressed including the moral and practical need for war, sustainable economics if children and mothers are of central importance to society, attitudes of the oneness of humanity vs racism, the importance of the arts and so on. On the other hand, she has examined many of the same issues in young ladies lives in high school.|$|E
25|$|Although the University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute did get bad publicity, it was {{suggested}} {{that this is not the}} reason why they stopped using baboons. The University of Michigan's mission was to create safer cars for human use. In order to reach this goal, research and testing is inevitable. The cruelty and the moral <b>dilemmas</b> <b>of</b> animal testing did not trump researchers still using them as subjects. They reasoned that biomechanics data is needed for an experiment like this, which will lead to safer cars. Years later animal testing ceased and instead an instrumental dummy was created for replacement. In 1978, animals were their only source of subject that would be a reliable substitution to the human being. The disadvantage though to using an instrumental dummy or a human cadaver, is that the tissue is not alive and will not elicit the same response as, for an example, a live animal. Today, it is not common to see animals being tested upon for automobile accidents because of the advance in computers and technology. It is, although, difficult to use cadavers instead of animals because of human rights, and it is difficult to obtain permission from the families, especially with children. Consent for a research and testing can occur only if the person responsible for giving consent is a competent person and one who also comprehends the research and testing procedures fully.|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from the}} {{narrative}} {{qualities of the}} film, the filmmaking was also praised for the depth and thoroughness of its thematic content. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, who assigned it 3½ stars out of four, wrote that Silence [...] "offers frustratingly few answers but all the right questions" [...] and argued that it is among the director's [...] "most spiritually moving films to date". In Slant, Jesse Cataldo argued, [...] "Tapping into the vast pool of vagueness and uncertainty that exists beneath the veneer of a rigid, righteous belief, Scorsese crafts a versatile, multifaceted work that encourages serious reflection and contemplation." [...] Alissa Wilkinson of Vox wrote that Silence [...] "is beautiful, unsettling {{and one of the}} finest religious movies ever made". John Ehrett of The Federalist praised the film highly, saying, [...] "Silence is a must-see masterpiece about the paradoxes of faith." [...] Ehrett further added, [...] "Complex yet reverent, Silence explores the meanings and <b>dilemmas</b> <b>of</b> Christian faith, and decisively sets a new benchmark for religious films." ...|$|E
500|$|His next film, {{entitled}} How Do You Know, {{was released}} December 17, 2010; Brooks produced, directed and wrote it. The film stars Reese Witherspoon {{as a professional}} softball player involved in a love triangle. Brooks began work on the film in 2005, wishing to create a film about a young female athlete. While interviewing numerous women for hundreds of hours in his research for the film he also became interested in [...] "the <b>dilemmas</b> <b>of</b> contemporary business executives, who are sometimes held accountable by the law for corporate behavior of which they {{may not even be}} aware." [...] He created Paul Rudd and Jack Nicholson's characters for this concept. Filming finished in November 2009, although Brooks later reshot the film's opening and ending. The New York Times described it as [...] "perhaps the most closely guarded of Columbia's movies this year." [...] Brooks was paid $10 million for the project, which cost $100 million. The film was negatively received. Patrick Goldstein wrote in the Los Angeles Times that [...] "the characters were stick figures, the jokes were flat, the situations felt scarily insular." [...] He felt the film showed Brooks had [...] "finally lost his comic mojo" [...] concluding [...] "his films used to have a wonderfully restless, neurotic energy, but How Do You Know feels like it was phoned in from someone resting uncomfortably on his laurels." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge also felt the film showed Brooks had lost his [...] "spark". Richard Corliss of Time was more positive, writing [...] "without being great, it's still the flat-out finest romantic comedy of the year," [...] while [...] "Brooks hasn't lost his gift for dreaming up heroes and heroines who worry amusingly." ...|$|E
500|$|The plot {{revolves}} around a dysfunctional family, comprising a father, a mother, their daughter and the father's mother. The story begins with two lovers, whose relationship is running dry. They decide {{to have a}} child, which the woman believes may save their relationship ("Between Love and Fire"). The birth of a baby girl destroys in the mother her hopes for a brilliant professional career and smothers her passion. On the other hand, the newborn child causes in the father a stiffening of his feelings and the refusal to compromise his career for a [...] "spoilt brat" [...] ("Sins of Idealism"). The girl, perceived in the family as an unwanted burden, tries {{to adapt to the}} psychological abuse she receives, but she is the object of frequent quarrels and grows sad and depressed ("Beautiful Emptiness"). She searches for quietness and strength in her inner fantasy world, and friendship and love on the internet, becoming ever more detached from the real world and eccentric in the eyes of her schoolmates and parents ("Eccentric", [...] "Digital Deceit", [...] "Through Square Eyes"). The line of pain that connects the child to her parents appears indestructible and the situation gets worse when the father thinks of leaving ("Blind Pain", [...] "Two Sides"). The intervention of the girl's grandmother reveals that the father was himself a neglected child and a victim of his family ("Victim of Choices"). The father's anger is a reaction to his abuse as a child and this realization seems to soften the girl's pain, bringing her out of her defensive shell ("Reflections"). In conclusion, the grown-up daughter, now a mother herself, faces the same <b>dilemmas</b> <b>of</b> her parents and is bound to repeat her parents' mistakes, closing the invisible circle that endures from one generation to another ("Life's Vortex").|$|E
