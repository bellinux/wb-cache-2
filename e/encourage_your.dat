2500|$|On her homepage, Pierce states {{she gets}} most ideas from things she stumbles upon. Her concept of magic as a {{tapestry}} of threads comes from her experiences in crocheting, {{and in her}} world, all mages are somehow based on British naturalist David Attenborough after watching his nature documentaries. Fantasy novels and Arthurian legend were {{the base of the}} worlds she thought up as a girl, and later she added contemporary issues like youth crime, cholera outbreaks in Africa. In general, Pierce states: [...] "The best way to prepare to have ideas when you need them is to listen to and <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> obsessions." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Setting {{aside the}} {{supposed}} purpose,' said Sir Jasper, 'you admit, Mrs. Stebbing, that {{of your own}} knowledge, Miss White has never <b>encouraged</b> <b>your</b> son's attentions.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The audacity of {{that last}} {{question}} fairly took away my breath. [...] "You cruelly helped to deceive her," [...] I answered indignantly. [...] "You basely <b>encouraged</b> <b>your</b> brother in his fatal policy of silence." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. MALAPROP Why, thou barbarous Vandyke--those {{letters are}} mine--When {{you are more}} {{sensible}} of my benignity--perhaps I may be brought to <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> addresses.|$|E
6000|$|... 'None whatever--by letter,' said Louis. 'Her {{impression}} plainly is {{that she}} cannot <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> lordship. Yet, {{in the face of}} all this reticence, the secret {{is that she}} loves you warmly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, of course! It isn't {{just the}} thing for a gentleman moving in the select circles of Clover Street, as you do; but why not come, sometimes, in the {{character}} of distinguished guest, and <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> humble friends? I was talking {{with a lot of the}} fellows about you the other night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, after all, Herr Schurz,' said Harry, expostulating, 'you {{get paid}} for your labour, and the rich man is doing better by <b>{{encouraging}}</b> <b>your</b> skill than by encouraging the less useful skill of other workmen.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MADAM--I {{have taken}} {{what you may}} be {{inclined}} to think a great liberty. I have assisted your son George in setting his uncle's authority at defiance. I have <b>encouraged</b> <b>your</b> son George in his resolution to be true, in time and in eternity, to my grandchild, Mary Dermody.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{have been}} {{fighting}} the savages, Deerslayer, singly and by yourself!" [...] she said. [...] "In your wish {{to take care of}} us---of Hetty--of me, perhaps, you've fought the enemy bravely, with no eye to <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> deeds, or to witness your fall, had it pleased Providence to suffer so great a calamity!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must {{do as you}} will, good Wilkin Flammock," [...] {{said the}} butler; [...] "but I pray you, {{remember}} all men are not alike. That which will but warm your Flemish hearts, will put wildfire into Norman brains; and what may only <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> countrymen to man the walls, will make ours fly over the battlements." ...|$|E
6000|$|A priest burst {{suddenly}} {{through the}} hangings {{of the doorway}} and falling upon {{his hands and knees}} rubbed his forehead against the stone flagging. [...] "O Jad-ben-Otho," [...] he cried, [...] "the warriors of Ja-don have attacked the palace and the temple. Even now they are fighting in the corridors near the quarters of Lu-don, and the high priest begs that you come to the palace and <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> faithful warriors by your presence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{should not}} be sorry to have a witness," [...] said Mr. Wilton, [...] "but it is impossible. I am ashamed to say how unhinged I feel; no person, and no memories, ought to {{exercise}} such an influence over one. To tell you the truth, I <b>encouraged</b> <b>your</b> pleasant gossip at breakfast by way of distraction at this moment, and now"---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are wrong," [...] said Sir Patrick. [...] "I, too, am sorry for Miss Silvester. But I am {{convinced}} that she has not left Blanche without a serious reason for it. And I believe you will be <b>encouraging</b> <b>your</b> wife in a hopeless effort, if you encourage her to persist {{in the search for}} her lost friend. However, it is your affair, and not mine. Do you wish me to offer you any facilities for tracing Miss Silvester which I may happen to possess?" ...|$|R
6000|$|If {{then our}} nursery you will nourish, We and our Muses too will flourish, [...] <b>Encouraged</b> by <b>your</b> favour; We'll doctrines teach the times to serve, And more five {{thousand}} pounds deserve, [...] By future good behaviour.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place," [...] Norgate continued, [...] "the {{subscribers}} to this fund, which {{is by no}} means exhausted by the sum I mention, demand that you accept no compromise, that at all costs you insist upon the whole bill, and that if it is attempted at the last moment to deprive the Irish people by trickery of the full extent of their liberty, you do not hesitate to <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> Nationalist party to fight for their freedom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may smoke until I go, Mr. Collinson, {{and even}} afterwards, {{if you keep}} the bowl of your pipe behind a rock, {{so as to be}} out of sight of your fellow sentry, whose advances, by the way, if I were you, I should not <b>encourage.</b> <b>Your</b> {{position}} here, you see, is a rather peculiar one. You were saying, I think, that a lingering affection for your wife impelled you to keep this place for her, although you were convinced of her death?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Miss Halton said she, I am as much {{convinced}} {{of that as}} you can be, and I do assure you that I should be {{the last person to}} <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> marrying anyone who had not some pretensions to expect a fortune with you. Mr Musgrove is so far from being poor that he has an estate of several hundreds an year which is capable of great Improvement, and an excellent House, though at Present it is not quite in repair." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS MARCH. Cook, you're wandering. I'm {{surprised}} at <b>your</b> <b>encouraging</b> the idea; I really am.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bertram," [...] said Henry Crawford, [...] "I {{shall make}} a point of coming to Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon. I shall come on purpose to {{encourage}} a young beginner. When is it to be? Miss Price, will not you join me in <b>encouraging</b> <b>your</b> cousin? Will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time--as I shall do--not to lose a word; or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil. When will it be? You must preach at Mansfield, you know, that Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you." ...|$|R
60|$|Purity of Watering-places.--Make no litter by {{the side}} of watering-places; and <b>encourage</b> among <b>your</b> party the Mahomedan feeling of respect for {{preserving}} the purity of drinking-water. Old travellers commonly encamp at a distance from the watering-place, and fetch the water to their camp.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it cloaks {{a deeper}} feeling. One of the noblest women I ever knew used to laugh merrily when she foozled a short putt. It was only later, when I {{learned that in}} the privacy of her home she would weep bitterly and bite holes in the sofa cushions, that I {{realized}} that she did but wear the mask. Continue to <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> fiancee to play the game, my boy. Much happiness will reward you. I could tell you a story----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mary Louise {{reflected}} on this confession. [...] "I'm afraid, Alora dear, that modern novels are not prone to teach morality, or {{to develop a}} girl's finer intuitions," [...] she said gravely. [...] "I think you express yourself very well--better than I do, indeed--but you need association with those who can convey to you the right principles of thought and thus <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> mental development. Culture and refinement seem to come more from association than from books, although there is an innate tendency in all well-born people to acquire them spontaneously. But there! you'll accuse me of preaching and, after all, I think you've done just splendidly under rather trying circumstances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lundie has his weakness, and is fast {{forgetting the}} broadsword and open heaths in his tree and rifle practice. But, Mistress Dunham, tak' {{the word of}} an old soldier, who has seen his fifty-fifth year, when he talls ye {{that there is no}} surer method to <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> enemy than to seem to fear him; and that there is no danger in this Indian warfare that the fancies and imaginations of your Americans have not {{enlarged}} upon, until they see a savage in every bush. We Scots come from a naked region, and have no need and less relish for covers, and so ye'll be seeing, Mistress Dunham--" ...|$|E

40|$|You {{are the key}} {{bearers of}} {{tradition}} and knowledge. Your vocation, as future teachers, is to pass this knowledge onto the next generation. ” (His Eminence Cardinal George Pell, March 2010) His Eminence Cardinal George Pell recently spoke to Education students at The University of Notre Dame Australia’s Sydney Campus to emphasise how imperative their role as future teachers will become. During the inaugural address the Cardinal reminded the students of the role they will have in shaping the futures {{of the children in}} their care and encouraged them to be the best teachers they can be. “Your main focus is to know each child in your care and to work towards their development; you need to be intelligent and understanding and to have a personality that <b>encourages</b> <b>your</b> pupils to learn.

60|$|In the Ode on Melancholy Keats, {{in a more}} bitter mood, {{finds the}} presence, in a {{fleeting}} world, of eternal beauty {{the source of the}} deepest melancholy. To <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> melancholy mood, he tells us, do not look on the things counted sad, but on the most beautiful, which are only quickly-fading manifestations of the everlasting principle of beauty. It is then, when a man most deeply loves the beautiful, when he uses his capacities of joy to the utmost, that the full bitterness of the contrast between the real and the ideal comes home to him and crushes him. If he did not feel so much he would not suffer so much; if he loved beauty less he would care less that he could not hold it long.|$|E
6000|$|... "I fail to {{take your}} light view of your brother's extravagance," [...] said the rector, {{addressing}} Oscar with his loftiest severity of manner, at the door. [...] "I deplore and reprehend Mr. Nugent's misuse of the bounty bestowed on him by an all-wise Providence. You will do well to consider, before you <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> brother's extravagance by lending him money. What does the great poet of humanity say of lenders? The Bard of Avon tells us, that 'loan oft loses both itself and friend.' Lay that noble line to heart, Oscar! Lucilla, be on your guard against that restlessness which I have already had occasion to reprove. I find I must leave you, Madame Pratolungo. I had forgotten my parish duties. My parish duties are waiting for me. Good day! good day!" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{then from}} America and England you can <b>encourage</b> <b>your</b> race in Austria, France, and Germany, and {{materially}} help it. It was a pathetic tale that {{was told by}} a poor Jew a fortnight ago during the riots, {{after he had been}} raided by the Christian peasantry and despoiled of everything he had. He said his vote was of no value to him, and he wished he could be excused from casting it, for indeed, casting it was a sure damage to him, since, no matter which party he voted for, the other party would come straight and take its revenge out of him. Nine per cent of the population, these Jews, and apparently they cannot put a plank into any candidate's platform! If you will send our Irish lads over here I think they will organise your race and change the aspect of the Reichsrath.|$|E
40|$|In the past, {{advocates for}} tougher gun laws {{have turned to}} federal, state, and local legislatures for solutions. For a variety of reasons, however, it has been {{difficult}} to enact progressive gun policies into law. Appeals to the gun industry to use more care in distributing and selling its products have also fallen on deaf ears. Thankfully, neither legislation nor appeals to the consicience of gun manufacturers are the only options available to advocates seeking to reduce gun violence in our country. This report will discuss one innovative new strategy that promises to achieve chage: the use of "buyer power" to reform the gun industry. By <b>encouraging</b> <b>your</b> municipal officials to utilize their buyer power as mass-purchasers of firearms to pressure gun manufacturers to self-regulate, yuou can make it much more difficult for dangerous individuals in America to acquire firearms...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! I {{have touched}} you," [...] laughed the armourer; [...] "come now, {{out with the}} truth. My lad," [...] he added more gravely, [...] "there is no shame in it; you know that I have always <b>encouraged</b> <b>your</b> wishes to be a soldier, and have done my best to render you as good a one as any who draws sword 'neath the king's banner, and assuredly I would not have taken all these pains with you did I think that you were always to wear an iron cap and trail a pike. I too, lad, hope some day to see you a valiant knight, and have reasons that you wot not of, for my belief {{that it will be}} so. No man rises to rank and fame any the less quickly because he thinks that bright eyes will grow {{brighter}} at his success." ...|$|R
