5|$|In Stage six (universal ethical {{principles}} driven), moral reasoning {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal {{ethical principles}}. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest,</b> expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|E
5|$|The essay {{begins by}} declaring that anarchists had {{correctly}} resisted the war from its inception, {{and that the}} authors would prefer a peace brought about by an international conference of European workers. It then submits that German workers would most likely also favor such a conclusion to the war, and presents several reasons why it would be <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> to call for an armistice. These reasons were that the citizens, after twenty months of war, would understand {{that they had been}} deceived into believing they were taking part in a defensive war; that they would recognize that the German state had long prepared for such a conflict, and as such it would be inevitably at fault; that the German Empire could not logistically support an occupation of the territory it had captured; and that the individuals living in the occupied territories were free to choose whether or not they would like to be annexed.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to ecological considerations, decisions regarding {{the future of}} the fisheries were also influenced by social and economic factors. Throughout Atlantic Canada, however most pronounced in Newfoundland, the cod fishery was a source of social and cultural identity. For many families, it also represented their livelihood: most families were connected either directly or indirectly with the fishery as fishers, fish plant workers, fish sellers, fish transporters, or as employees in related businesses. Additionally, many companies, both foreign and domestic, as well as individuals, had invested heavily in the boats, equipment and the infrastructure of the fishery, and therefore felt it was <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> to maintain an open-access policy to the ocean and its resources. What this alludes to is the unfortunate paradox that often accompanies open-access resources and is known by most as the Tragedy of the Commons: what is in the individual's best interest is not always {{in the best interest of}} a society at whole. In the case of Newfoundland and the Northern Cod fishery this meant that from the perspective of the individual participating in the fishing industry, maximizing their catch was in their best interest; however when the government failed to intervene – due largely to the highly sensitive nature of the political discourse created by the expansive group of stakeholders – the ecosystem was brought past its threshold and collapsed, leaving everyone worse-off.|$|E
500|$|Stage two (self-interest driven) {{expresses the}} [...] "what's {{in it for}} me" [...] position, in which right {{behavior}} is defined by whatever the individual believes to be <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one's reputation or relationships to groups of people. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only {{to a point where}} it might further the individual's own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect, but rather a [...] "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours" [...] mentality. The lack of a societal perspective in the pre-conventional level {{is quite different from the}} social contract (stage five), as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual's own needs or interests. For the stage two theorist, the world's perspective is often seen as morally relative.|$|E
500|$|There was {{no known}} {{alternative}} fuel for nuclear reactors other than uranium, so securing an adequate supply {{was crucial to}} the British atomic energy programme. [...] During the war, Britain {{took the lead in}} reopening the world's richest uranium mine, the Shinkolobwe mine in the Belgian Congo, which had been flooded and closed, as 30 percent of the stock in Union Minière du Haut Katanga, the company that owned the mine, was controlled by British interests. In May 1944, Sir John Anderson and US Ambassador John Winant negotiated a deal with the Belgian government in exile and Edgar Sengier, the director of Union Minière, for the mine to be reopened and [...] of ore to be purchased at $1.45 a pound. American and British leaders concluded that it was <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> to gain control of as much of the world's uranium deposits as possible. The Combined Development Trust was established for this purpose on 14 June 1944. It consisted of three American, two British and one Canadian members, with an American, initially Groves, as chairman. By the end of the war, it had control of 97 per cent of the world's uranium and 65 per cent of the thorium.|$|E

Mrs Justice Theis took into consideration the wishes of both parents and the two ‘intelligent, articulate and thoughtful’ minors and held that inoculation was <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>interests.</b> The troubled history of the MMR vaccine and its importance to public health provided the backdrop. Whilst the court's efforts to establish the views of the minors are to be commended, the decision is problematic in its assessment of the minors' individual medical interests and capacities, and in the significance placed on their views when determining whether inoculation would be <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>interests...</b>|$|R

2500|$|After the Civil War had ended, the United States Congress began {{passing the}} Reconstruction Acts {{to lay out}} {{requirements}} for the former Confederate States to be re-admitted to the Union, to include ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. One of its stipulations was specifically granting voting rights to black men. According to Wills, in the August 1867 state elections the Klan was relatively restrained in its actions. White Americans who made up the KKK hoped to persuade black voters that a return to their prewar state of bondage was <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest.</b> Forrest assisted in maintaining order. It was after these efforts failed that Klan violence and intimidation escalated and became widespread. Author Andrew Ward, however, writes, [...] "In the spring of 1867, Forrest and his dragoons launched a campaign of midnight parades; 'ghost' masquerades; and 'whipping' and even 'killing Negro voters and white Republicans, to scare blacks off voting and running for office'".|$|E
2500|$|Corporations may rely on {{borrowed}} funds (debt capital or credit) {{as sources}} of investment to sustain ongoing business operations or to fund future growth. [...] Debt comes in several forms, such as through bank loans, notes payable, or bonds issued to the public. [...] Bonds require the corporations to make regular interest payments (interest expenses) on the borrowed capital until the debt reaches its maturity date, therein the firm must pay back the obligation in full. [...] Debt payments can also {{be made in the}} form of sinking fund provisions, whereby the corporation pays annual installments of the borrowed debt above regular interest charges. [...] Corporations that issue callable bonds are entitled to pay back the obligation in full whenever the company feels it is <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> to pay off the debt payments. [...] If interest expenses cannot be made by the corporation through cash payments, the firm may also use collateral assets as a form of repaying their debt obligations (or through the process of liquidation).|$|E

2500|$|The State Bar of Arizona {{appealed to}} {{a desire to}} {{maintain}} a certain air of [...] "professionalism" [...] among lawyers as justifying its ban on lawyer advertising. [...] Advertising, the State Bar asserted, would [...] "undermine the attorney's sense of dignity and self-worth", [...] "erode the client's trust in the attorney" [...] by exposing an economic motive for representation, and [...] "tarnish the dignified public image of the profession". But the public understands that attorneys make their living at the bar, and few attorneys deceive themselves by thinking otherwise. [...] "Bankers and engineers advertise, and yet these professions are not regarded as undignified. [...] In fact, {{it has been suggested}} that the failure of lawyers to advertise creates public disillusionment with the profession." [...] A lack of information about the price of legal services tends to dissuade people of modest means from seeking legal representation, even when it is <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> to engage such representation. [...] Finally, insofar as the [...] "belief that lawyers are somehow 'above' trade has become an anachronism, the historical foundation for the advertising restraint has crumbled." ...|$|E
2500|$|While the Hull patent gave GE a {{basis for}} {{claiming}} legal rights over the fluorescent lamp, {{a few months after}} the lamp went into production the firm learned of a U.S. patent application that had been filed in 1927 for the aforementioned [...] "metal vapor lamp" [...] invented in Germany by Meyer, Spanner, and Germer. The patent application indicated that the lamp had been created as a superior means of producing ultraviolet light, but the application also contained a few statements referring to fluorescent illumination. Efforts to obtain a U.S. patent had met with numerous delays, but were it to be granted, the patent might have caused serious difficulties for GE. At first, GE sought to block the issuance of a patent by claiming that priority should go to one of their employees, Leroy J. Buttolph, who according to their claim had invented a fluorescent lamp in 1919 and whose patent application was still pending. GE also had filed a patent application in 1936 in Inman’s name to cover the “improvements” wrought by his group. In 1939 GE decided that the claim of Meyer, Spanner, and Germer had some merit, and that in any event a long interference procedure was not <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest.</b> They therefore dropped the Buttolph claim and paid $180,000 to acquire the Meyer, et al. application, which at that point was owned by a firm known as Electrons, Inc. The patent was duly awarded in December 1939. [...] This patent, along with the Hull patent, put GE on what seemed to be firm legal ground, although it faced years of legal challenges from Sylvania Electric Products, Inc., which claimed infringement on patents that it held.|$|E
