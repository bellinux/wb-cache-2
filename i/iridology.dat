5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy <b>iridology,</b> massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E

25|$|The {{particular}} modalities {{used by a}} naturopath {{vary with}} training and scope of practice. These may include herbalism, homeopathy, acupuncture, nature cures, physical medicine, applied kinesiology, colonic enemas, chelation therapy, color therapy, cranial osteopathy, hair analysis, <b>iridology,</b> live blood analysis, ozone therapy, psychotherapy, public health measures and hygiene, reflexology, rolfing, massage therapy, and traditional Chinese medicine. Nature cures include a range of therapies based on exposure to natural elements such as sunshine, fresh air, or heat or cold, as well as nutrition advice such as following a vegetarian and whole food diet, fasting, or abstention from alcohol and sugar. Physical medicine includes naturopathic, osseous, or soft tissue manipulative therapy, sports medicine, exercise, and hydrotherapy. Psychological counseling includes meditation, relaxation, and other methods of stress management.|$|E
2500|$|Certain naturopathic {{treatments}} {{offered by}} naturopaths, such as homeopathy, rolfing, and <b>iridology,</b> are widely considered pseudoscience or quackery. Stephen Barrett of QuackWatch and the National Council Against Health Fraud {{has stated that}} naturopathy is [...] "simplistic and that its practices are riddled with quackery". [...] "Non-scientific health care practitioners, including naturopaths, use unscientific methods and deception on a public who, lacking in-depth health care knowledge, must rely upon the assurance of providers. Quackery not only harms people, it undermines the ability to conduct scientific research and should be opposed by scientists", says William T. Jarvis.|$|E

5000|$|Edzard Ernst {{raised the}} {{question}} in 2000: [...] "Does <b>iridology</b> work? ... This search strategy resulted in 77 publications {{on the subject of}} <b>iridology.</b> ... All of the uncontrolled studies and several of the unmasked experiments suggested that <b>iridology</b> was a valid diagnostic tool.

In conclusion, few controlled studies with masked evaluation of diagnostic validity have been published. None have found any benefit from iridology." ...|$|E
50|$|Ignaz von Peczely (January 26, 1826 - July 14, 1911) was a Hungarian scientist, physician, homeopath, {{considered}} {{the father of}} modern <b>iridology.</b> Von Peczely first thought of <b>iridology</b> when caring for an owl with a broken leg. After noticing {{a spot in the}} owl's eye he hypothesized a link between the two and later tested this theory with other animals.|$|E
50|$|Most {{eye care}} {{professionals}} do not practice <b>iridology,</b> citing a significant lack of scientific {{evidence for the}} practice.|$|E
50|$|Critics, {{including}} most practitioners of medicine, dismiss <b>iridology</b> given that published {{studies have indicated}} a lack of success for its claims. To date, clinical data do not support correlation between illness {{in the body and}} coinciding observable changes in the iris. In controlled experiments, practitioners of <b>iridology</b> have performed statistically no better than chance in determining the presence of a disease or condition solely through observation of the iris.|$|E
50|$|As <b>iridology</b> has {{no value}} in {{diagnosing}} any diseases, possible harms {{in the use}} of <b>iridology</b> include the waste of time and money. More seriously, medical errors—treatment for conditions diagnosed via this method which do not actually exist (false positive result) or {{a false sense of security}} when a serious condition is not diagnosed by this method (false negative result)—could lead to improper or delayed treatment and even loss of life.|$|E

50|$|<b>Iridology</b> became {{better known}} in the United States in the 1950s, when Bernard Jensen, an American chiropractor, began giving classes in his own method. This is in direct {{relationship}} with P. Johannes Thiel, Eduard Lahn (who became an American {{under the name of}} Edward Lane) and J Haskell Kritzer. Jensen emphasized the importance of the body's exposure to toxins, and the use of natural foods as detoxifiers.|$|E
50|$|The Protestant pastor Leopold Erdmann Emanuel Felke (born 7 February 1856 in Kläden near Stendal, Germany; died 16 August 1926 in Munich, {{buried in}} Bad Sobernheim) was a {{naturopath}} {{who developed the}} eponymous Felke cure, and who was active in Repelen near Moers from 1896 to 1914 and in Bad Sobernheim from 1915 to 1925. He also practiced iris diagnosis (<b>iridology)</b> and is considered the co-father of combination homeopathic remedies.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Iridology</b> (also {{known as}} iridodiagnosis or iridiagnosis) is an {{alternative}} medicine technique whose proponents claim that patterns, colors, and other characteristics of the iris can be examined to determine information about a patient's systemic health. Practitioners match their observations to iris charts, which divide the iris into zones that correspond to specific parts of the human body. Iridologists see the eyes as [...] "windows" [...] into the body's state of health.|$|E
5000|$|Naturopaths {{trained at}} Bastyr are {{required}} to study various non-medical folk remedies, including homeopathy. David Gorski has been highly critical of this requirement; for him this makes the university fail the [...] "litmus test" [...] of whether it adheres to [...] "science and reality". In 1998, Bastyr offered an elective course in <b>iridology,</b> a debunked system of diagnosing medical conditions by looking for irregularities in the pigmentation of the iris.|$|E
50|$|The second 'father' to <b>iridology</b> {{is thought}} to be Nils Liljequist from Sweden, who greatly {{suffered}} from the outgrowth of his lymph nodes. After a round of medication made from iodine and quinine, he observed many differences in the colour of his iris. This observation inspired him to create and publish an atlas in 1893, which contained 258 black and white illustrations and 12 colour illustrations of the iris, known as the Diagnosis of the Eye.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, Bernard Jensen, {{a leading}} American iridologist, {{and two other}} <b>iridology</b> proponents failed to {{establish}} {{the basis of their}} practice when they examined photographs of the eyes of 143 patients in an attempt to determine which ones had kidney impairments. Of the patients, forty-eight had been diagnosed with kidney disease, and the rest had normal kidney function. Based on their analysis of the patients' irises, the three iridologists could not detect which patients had kidney disease and which did not.|$|E
50|$|Auriculotherapy (also {{auricular}} therapy, ear acupuncture, and auriculoacupuncture) {{is a form}} {{of alternative}} medicine {{based on the idea that}} the ear is a microsystem, which reflects the entire body, represented on the auricle, the outer portion of the ear. Conditions affecting the physical, mental or emotional health of the patient are assumed to be treatable by stimulation of the surface of the ear exclusively. Similar mappings are used in many areas of the body, including the practices of reflexology and <b>iridology.</b> These mappings are not based on or supported by any medical or scientific evidence.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{pointed out that the}} premise of <b>iridology</b> is at odds {{with the fact that the}} iris does not undergo {{substantial}} changes in an individual's life. Iris texture is a phenotypical feature that develops during gestation and remains unchanged after birth. There is no evidence for changes in the iris pattern other than variations in pigmentation in the first year of life and variations caused by glaucoma treatment. The stability of iris structures is the foundation of the biometric technology which uses iris recognition for identification purposes.|$|E
