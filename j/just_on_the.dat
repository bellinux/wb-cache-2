5|$|Storlien, <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Swedish {{side of the}} {{national}} border, grew up as a resort, with the first hotel established just after the railway arrived. Trade {{between the two countries}} increased, as Jämtland had easy access to the Trøndelag market. However, the freight rates were so high that it was cheaper to send some products to Trøndelag from the Swedish east coast by ship around Scania.|$|E
5|$|The Romans built many {{dams and}} {{reservoirs}} for water collection, {{such as the}} Subiaco Dams, two of which fed the Anio Novus, {{one of the largest}} aqueducts of Rome. They built 72 dams <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Iberian peninsula, and many more are known across the Empire, some still in use. Several earthen dams are known from Roman Britain, including a well-preserved example from Longovicium (Lanchester).|$|E
5|$|The windfield of an extratropical cyclone constricts with {{distance}} {{in relation to}} surface level pressure, with the lowest pressure being found near the center, and the highest winds typically <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cold/poleward side of warm fronts, occlusions, and cold fronts, where the pressure gradient force is highest. The area poleward and west of the cold and warm fronts connected to extratropical cyclones {{is known as the}} cold sector, while the area equatorward and east of its associated cold and warm fronts is known as the warm sector.|$|E

5|$|Growth, {{employment}} and household income have lagged behind the South, {{and the five}} most deprived districts in England are all in Northern England, as are ten of the twelve most declining major towns in the UK. The picture is not clear-cut, as the North has areas which are as wealthy as, if not wealthier than, fashionable Southern areas such as Surrey. Yorkshire's Golden Triangle which extends from north Leeds to Harrogate and across to York is an example, as is Cheshire's Golden Triangle, centred on Alderley Edge. There are major disparities even across individual cities: Sheffield Hallam {{is one of the}} wealthiest constituencies in the country, and is the richest outside London and the South East, while Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side of the city, {{is one of the most}} deprived. Housing in Northern England is more affordable than the UK average: the median house price in most Northern cities was below £200,000 in 2015 with typical increases of below 10% over the previous five years. However, some areas have seen house prices fall considerably, putting inhabitants at risk of negative equity.|$|E
5|$|In 631 Anna was {{probably}} at the Suffolk village of Exning, an important settlement with royal connections, and, {{according to the}} Liber Eliensis, the birthplace of his daughter Æthelthryth. By tradition, Æthelthryth {{is said to have}} been baptised at Exning in a pool known as St Mindred's Well. Exning was an important place strategically, as it stood <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> East Anglian side of the Devil's Dyke, a major earthwork stretching between the Fen edge and the headwaters of the River Stour, built at an earlier date to defend the East Anglian region from attack. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery discovered there suggests the existence of an important site nearby, possibly a royal estate or regio.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945 an Interim Committee {{was created}} to advise and report on wartime and postwar {{policies}} {{regarding the use of}} nuclear energy. The Interim Committee in turn established a scientific panel consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the Interim Committee the scientific panel offered its opinion not <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its likely military and political impact. This included opinions on such sensitive issues as whether or not the Soviet Union should be advised of the weapon in advance of its use against Japan.|$|E

5|$|In May 1945, the Interim Committee {{was created}} to advise on wartime and postwar use of nuclear energy. The {{committee}} was chaired by Stimson, with James F. Byrnes, a former US Senator soon to be Secretary of State, as President Harry S. Truman's personal representative; Ralph A. Bard, the Under Secretary of the Navy; William L. Clayton, the Assistant Secretary of State; Vannevar Bush; Karl T. Compton; James B. Conant; and George L. Harrison, an assistant to Stimson and president of New York Life Insurance Company.

5|$|The Texian {{army was}} {{a force of}} 810 volunteers and staff at this point, but few had any {{military}} training and experience. Faced with past desertions, discipline flaws, and individual indecisiveness of volunteers in training, Houston knew they were {{not yet ready to}} engage the Mexican army. Compounding the situation were the civilian refugees dependent upon the army for their protection. The news of Fannin's capture, combined with his doubts about the readiness of the Texian army, led Houston to order a retreat on March 26. Some of the troops viewed the decision as cowardice with Sesma sitting <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side of the Colorado, and several hundred men deserted.|$|E
