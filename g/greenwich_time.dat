50|$|In 1935, {{the term}} Universal Time was {{recommended}} by the International Astronomical Union as a more precise term than <b>Greenwich</b> Mean <b>Time,</b> because GMT could refer to either an astronomical day starting at noon or a civil day starting at midnight.

"But {{though the}} {{chronometer}} carried from Greenwich to China, should truly exhibit in China what the {{time may be}} at Greenwich at any moment; yet, though thereby it must necessarily contradict China time, it does by no means thence follow, that with respect to China, the China watches are at all out of the way. Precisely the reverse. For the fact of that variance is a presumption that, with respect to China, the Chinese watches must be all right; and consequently as the China watches are right as to China, so the Greenwich chronometers must be wrong as to China. Besides, of what use to the Chinaman would a Greenwich chronometer, keeping <b>Greenwich</b> <b>time,</b> be? Were he thereby to regulate his daily actions, he would be guilty of all manner of absurdities:--going to bed at noon, say, when his neighbors would be sitting down to dinner. And thus, though the earthly wisdom of man be heavenly folly to God; so also, conversely, is the heavenly wisdom of God an earthly folly to man. Literally speaking, this is so. Nor does the God at the heavenly Greenwich expect common men to keep Greenwich wisdom in this remote Chinese world of ours; because such a thing were unprofitable for them here, and, indeed, a falsification of Himself, inasmuch as in that case, China time would be identical with <b>Greenwich</b> <b>time,</b> which would make <b>Greenwich</b> <b>time</b> wrong.|$|E
60|$|It is a {{remarkable}} quality in a watering-place out of the season, that everything in it, will and must be looked at. I had no previous suspicion of this fatal truth but, the moment I sat down to write, I began to perceive it. I had scarcely fallen into my most promising attitude, and dipped my pen in the ink, when I found the clock upon the pier - a red-faced clock with a white rim - importuning me in a highly vexatious manner to consult my watch, and see how I was off for <b>Greenwich</b> <b>time.</b> Having no intention of making a voyage or taking an observation, I had not the least need of <b>Greenwich</b> <b>time,</b> and could have put up with watering-place time as a sufficiently accurate article. The pier-clock, however, persisting, I {{felt it necessary to}} lay down my pen, compare my watch with him, and fall into a grave solicitude about half- seconds. I had taken up my pen again, and was about to commence that valuable chapter, when a Custom-house cutter under the window requested that I would hold a naval review of her, immediately.|$|E

"It {{seems to}} me, in my visions, {{that there is}} a certain most rare order of human souls, which if {{carefully}} carried in the body will almost always and everywhere give Heaven's own Truth, with some small grains of variance. For peculiarly coming from God, the sole source of that heavenly truth, and the great Greenwich hill and tower from which the universal meridians are far out into infinity reckoned; such souls seem as London sea-chronometers (Greek, time-namers) which as the London ship floats past Greenwich down the Thames, are accurately adjusted by <b>Greenwich</b> <b>time,</b> and if heedfully kept, will still give that same time, even though carried to the Azores. True, in nearly all cases of long, remote voyages--to China, say--chronometers of the best make, and the most carefully treated, will gradually more or less vary from <b>Greenwich</b> <b>time,</b> without the possibility of the error being corrected by direct comparison with their great standard; but skillful and devout observations of the stars by the sextant will serve materially to lessen such errors. And besides, {{there is such a thing}} as rating a chronometer; that is, having ascertained its degree of organic inaccuracy, however small, then in all subsequent chronometrical calculations, that ascertained loss or gain can be readily added or deducted, as the case may be. Then again, on these long voyages, the chronometer may be corrected by comparing it with the chronometer of some other ship at sea, more recently from home.|$|E

For {{purposes}} that you will presently understand, books are calculated for certain meridians, or longitudes, as at Greenwich and Paris, and those who use the books calculated for Greenwich, get their chronometers set at Greenwich, and those who use the Paris, get their chronometers set to Paris time.

It is a simple thing to ascertain the true time of day by an observation of the sun, which marks the hours in his track; {{and when we get}} our observation, we have some one to note the time at a particular instant on the chronometer. By noting the hour, minutes, and seconds, at Greenwich, at the very instant we observe here, when we have calculated from that observation the time here, we have only to add, or subtract, the time here from that of Greenwich, to know precisely how far east or west we are from Greenwich, which gives us our longitude." ...|$|E
