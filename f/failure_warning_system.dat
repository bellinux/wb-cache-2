40|$|The {{research}} in this work addresses {{the need for a}} warning system to predict future application failures. PreCog, the predictive and regressional error correlating guide system, aims to aid administrators by providing a robust future <b>failure</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> statistically induced from past system behavior. In this work, we show that with the use of machine learning techniques such as Adaptive Boosting and Correlation-based Feature Selection, PreCog, without any prior knowledge of its target, can be accurately and reliably trained within a virtual environment using past system metrics to predict future application in a variety of domains. by Adam Rogal.

40|$|Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and Microfluidics are {{becoming}} popular solutions for sensing, diagnostics and control applications. Reliability and validation of function is of increasing {{importance in the}} majority of these applications. On-line testing strategies for these devices have the potential to provide real-time condition monitoring information. It is shown that this information can be used to diagnose and prognose the health of the device. This information {{can also be used to}} provide an early <b>failure</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> by predicting the remaining useful life. Diagnostic and prognostic outcomes can also be leveraged to improve the reliability, dependability and availability of these devices. This work has delivered a methodology for a “lightweight” prognostics solution for a microfluidic device based on real-time diagnostics. An oscillation based test methodology is used to extract diagnostic information that is processed using a Linear Discriminant Analysis based classifier. This enables the identification of current health based on pre-defined health levels. As the deteriorating device is periodically classified, the rate at which the device degrades is used to predict the devices remaining useful life...|$|E
40|$|Summary. [...] Calculations {{have been}} made to find the changes in rotor speed {{following}} engine failure in forward flight. Several particular examples were investigated, based on the parameters of the S- 81 helicopter. The effect of pilot's control movement was included. A rapid loss of rotational speed occurs with practically no change in forward speed of the helicopter, thus the tip-speed ratio increases rapidly. This may lead to stalling of the retreating blade and/or interference of th'e blades with the droop stops, either of which are dangerous conditions. The time available to the pilot to reduce the collective pitch after engine failure is very short throughout the speed range and engine failure constitutes a danger to safety on this type of helicopter. Some form of automatic pitch reduction or power <b>failure</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> is necessary. 1. Introduction. [...] In a previous report 1 ', the behaviour of a helicopter rotor after engine failure in hovering flight was calculated and compared with the one available flight case. The present report extends the work to engine failure during forward flight. The method of calculation is somewhat similar to that used il/Ref. 1, but the attitude of the disc has to be considered as an additional variable. Rotor disc attitude can be controlled to some extent by the pilot and...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine data {{generated}} using high-resolution three-dimensional laser scanning monitoring of coastal rock cliffs. These data {{are used to}} identify spatial and temporal patterns in rockfall activity behavior prior to slope failure. Analysis of the data suggests that given sufficient measurement precision precursory behavior, here manifest as the rate of rockfall activity prior to failure, can be detected, measured, and monitored. Environmental conditions {{appear to have a}} diminishing influence on the occurrence of increasingly large slope failures. The monitoring data implies a time-dependent sequence in the occurrence of smaller rockfalls in the period leading to the largest failures recorded. This behavior is attributed to the mechanisms of strain accumulation in the rock mass resulting from brittle failure of the slope. The implication is that combining these data with models of failure mechanisms may allow failure time to be forecast from wide-area monitoring of precursory behavior. These findings have implications for the management of potentially unstable slopes, the understanding of slope failure mechanisms, and the generation of a new type of slope <b>failure</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Niobec mine {{is located}} in St-Honore 15 km {{north-east}} of Chicoutimi (Quebec, Canada) and produces Niobium {{at a rate of}} 815, 000 metric tones annually. Exploitation is done using the Long Hole method with sill and crown pillars at the levels 300 - 600 (90 - 180 m) and 700 - 1000 (200 - 300 m). For economic reasons, no backfill has been used at this mine. As a result, stopes with a minimum 100 meters in height have been left open since excavation. Mining activity take places in a carbonatite pluton located in the Pre-Cambrian Shield. The carbonatite and host rocks are capped by flat lying limestone. Six CIUS (Cylindre Instrumente de l'Universite de Sherbrooke) have been installed at this mine. The CIUS is a cylindrical concrete inclusion, instrumented with vibrating wires, installed in a borehole and used to follow the variations of stress and deformation in the host medium (rock mass). The objectives of instrumentation at this mine by the CIUS are to monitor the variations of stress and deformation. The thesis presents the development and application of a probabilistic model for prevention and prediction of in-situ rock mass failure. The programming procedure of a rock <b>failure</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> (Alarm System) using the CIUS' data has also been presented.

40|$|There are two {{implanted}} heart <b>failure</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> {{incorporated into}} biventricular pacemakers/automatic implantable cardiac defibrillators and tested in clinical trials: right heart pressures, and lung conductance measurements. However, both <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> postdate {{measures of the}} earliest indicator of impending heart failure: left ventricular (LV) volume. There are currently no proposed implanted technologies that can perform LV blood volume measurements in humans. We propose {{to solve this problem}} by incorporating an admittance measurement system onto currently deployed biventricular and automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator leads. This study will demonstrate that an admittance measurement system can detect LV blood conductance from the epicardial position, despite the current generating and sensing electrodes being in constant motion with the heart, and with dynamic removal of the myocardial component of the returning voltage signal. Specifically, in 11 pigs, it will be demonstrated that 1) a physiological LV blood conductance signal can be derived; 2) LV dilation in response to dose-response intravenous neosynephrine can be detected by blood conductance in a similar fashion to the standard of endocardial crystals when admittance is used, but not when only traditional conductance is used; 3) the physiological impact of acute left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and resultant LV dilation can be detected by blood conductance, before the anticipated secondary rise in right ventricular systolic pressure; and 4) a pleural effusion simulated by placing saline outside the pericardium does not serve as a source of artifact for blood conductance measurements...|$|R

40|$|Effective drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> are an {{integral}} part of efforts worldwide to improve drought preparedness. Timely and reliable data and information must be the cornerstone of effective drought policies and plans. In pursuit of the goal of improving the effectiveness of drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems,</b> participants of the experts meeting were asked to address three fundamental questions: 1. What is your assessment of the current status of drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems?</b> 2. What are the shortcomings, limitations, and needs for drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems?</b> 3. How can drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> be improved to better support drought preparedness and mitigation efforts at the local, national, and international level? Participants identified the primary users of data and information derived from drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> as a first step in evaluating the status of early <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> Users were diverse, including government agencies, farmers, extension services, insurance companies, media, donors, NGOs, and the general public. Leadership for drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> is provided principally by meteorological or agricultural services. In general, where meteorological services were the lead agency, the information tended to be more meteorologically based. In contrast, leadership for drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> that were more agriculturally based tended to take a more multidisciplinary or integrated approach to monitoring. An integrated approach is considered preferable because information from all elements of the hydrologic system must be considered to obtain a comprehensive assessment of climate and water supply conditions. Although forecasting and monitoring are considered critical components of all early <b>warning</b> <b>systems,</b> there appeared to be little evidence of the beneficial use of that information by farmers. It was noted that few countries currently have a national drought policy in place. Australia is an exception and progress in South Africa and the United States was noted. It was apparent that other countries were moving in the direction of a national drought policy. In some instances, subnational policies were in existence.
