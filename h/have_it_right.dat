6000|$|... "Wal, you <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> then. I {{took it upon}} {{myself to}} get {{exemption}} for you. That government official heartily approved of my recommendin' exemption for you. An' he gave it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{will see}} Mary. We will settle it between us, and <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> yet; {{but we must}} give her to-day to think it over, and get over the first shock. When she has had a little time for reflection, a few cool {{arguments}} from me will bring her to reason.' ...|$|E

"Rebecca'll <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> off {{the stove}} {{in half a}} minute now," [...] Mrs. Savor concluded; and from a further room came the cheerful click of cups, and then a {{wandering}} whiff of the coffee; life in its vulgar kindliness touched and made friends with death, claiming it a part of nature too.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{you shall}} <b>have</b> <b>it,</b> <b>right</b> or wrong, my {{handsome}} fellow. By Heaven, you are much too good-looking {{to be made}} a monk of! What do you mean, you villains, by attempting to kidnap free men? Is it not {{enough for you to}} lock up every mad girl whom you can dupe, but you must--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{sunshine}} here now," [...] {{declared the}} Major. [...] "We've <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> along. But I haven't seen the roses yet, {{and a pair}} of ear muffs wouldn't be uncomfortable in this cutting breeze." ...|$|R

5000|$|Where Do We Go From Here? - Loxton {{offers his}} {{perspective}} {{on the future of}} skepticism as a movement.

6000|$|They knew he {{was just}} setting a trap for them, and the same thought struck them both at once. They rose up and leaned over the papa, with their arms across and their fluffy heads {{together}} {{in the form of}} a capital letter A, and whispered in each other's ears, [...] "You say it's one, and I'll say it's the other, and then we'll <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> between us." ...|$|E

I thank you, now I <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>right.</b> Do you {{understand}}, Olaf, I mean, Sir Saint, what sort of a story I must tell of you after I have struck? Do you understand that not only are you about to die, but that infamy will be poured upon your name and that your body will be dragged through the streets and thrown to the dogs with the city offal? Answer, I say, answer!" ...|$|E
60|$|The first intimation I had {{of it was}} {{the sudden}} {{blotting}} out of the sunlight from above, and as I glanced quickly up, I saw a most terrific creature swooping down upon me. It must have been fully eighty feet long {{from the end of}} its long, hideous beak to the tip of its thick, short tail, with an equal spread of wings. It was coming straight for me and hissing frightfully--I could hear it above the whir of the propeller. It was coming straight down toward the muzzle of the machine-gun and I let it <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> in the breast; but still it came for me, so that I had to dive and turn, though I was dangerously close to earth.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{biggest reason}} {{why this is so}} disappointing {{is that this is a}} tournament that I dreamt of winning as a kid. I spent hours practicing, countless hours practicing, dreaming of winning this tournament. I came out here months in advance to get ready and <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> there in my hand, man. <b>It</b> was <b>right</b> there and I let it go."

6000|$|... "I {{have never}} felt it!" [...] cried the Blind Girl. [...] "I {{have never felt}} it in its fulness. Never! I have {{sometimes}} wished that I could see you, or could see him--only once, dear father, only for one little minute--that I might {{know what it is}} I treasure up," [...] she laid her hands upon her breast, [...] "and hold here! That I might be sure I <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>right!</b> And sometimes (but then I was a child) I have wept in my prayers at night, to think that, when your images ascended from my heart to Heaven, they might not be the true resemblance of yourselves. But I have never had these feelings long. They have passed away, and left me tranquil and contented." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They went in unto Noah." [...] And let no man deride, {{for that}} I say, By an {{instinct}} from above; for God hath not only wrought wonders in men, {{but even in}} the beasts, and fowls of the air; to the making of them act both above and against their own nature. How did Baalam's ass speak! (Num 22:28-30). And the cows that drew the ark, <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> to the place which God had appointed, not regarding their sucking calves! (1 Sam 6:10-14). Yea, how did those ravenous creatures, the ravens, bring the prophet bread and flesh twice a day, but by immediate instinct from heaven? (1 Kings 17:6). Even by the same did these go in to Noah, into the ark.|$|E

Each one has a square and is collecting names for it. If {{you want to have}} your name on the quilt you pay five cents, {{and if you want to}} <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> in the round spot in the middle of the square you must pay ten cents. Then when we have got all the names we can we will embroider them on the squares. The money is to go to the little girl our Band is supporting in Korea. I heard that nobody had asked you, so I thought perhaps you would give me your name for my square." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{just then}} there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no {{exception}} to this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman's house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Mrs. Nettlepoint {{is going}} in that ship,' Mrs. Allen had said; and she had {{represented}} that nothing was simpler than to put the girl in her charge. When Mrs. Mavis had replied that that was all very well but that she didn't know the lady, Mrs. Allen had declared that that didn't make a speck of difference, for Mrs. Nettlepoint was kind enough for anything. It was easy enough to know her, if {{that was all the}} trouble. All Mrs. Mavis would have to do would be to go up to her the next morning when she took her daughter to the ship (she would see her there on the deck with her party) and tell her what she wanted. Mrs. Nettlepoint had daughters herself and she would easily understand. Very likely she would even look after Grace a little on the other side, in such a queer situation, going out alone to the gentleman she was engaged to; she would just help her to turn round before she was married. Mr. Porterfield seemed to think they wouldn't wait long, once she was there: they would <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> over at the American consul's. Mrs. Allen had said it would perhaps be better still to go and see Mrs. Nettlepoint beforehand, that day, to tell her what they wanted: then they wouldn't seem to spring it on her just as she was leaving. She herself (Mrs. Allen) would call and say a word for them if she could save ten minutes before catching her train. If she hadn't come it was because she hadn't saved her ten minutes; but she had made them feel that they must come all the same. Mrs. Mavis liked that better, because on the ship in the morning there would be such a confusion. She didn't think her daughter would be any trouble--conscientiously she didn't. It was just to have some one to speak to her and not sally forth like a servant-girl going to a situation.|$|E

60|$|Jill and I {{fixed up}} what I {{was to say}} and Jill made me say {{it over and over}} again to be sure I <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>right.</b> I told her--sarcastically--that she'd better say it herself and then it would be done properly. Jill said she would if it were Aunt Tommy, but when it was Dick it was better for a man to do it. So of course I agreed.|$|R

6000|$|... "I looked. There, {{floating}} in {{the centre of the}} lovely tranquil pool, was Jim-Jim's head. The lioness <b>had</b> bitten <b>it</b> <b>right</b> off, and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> rolled down the sloping rock into the water." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Think {{about the}} band playing on while the Titanic goes down. Think {{of some of}} Joel Gray's bitchier numbers in Cabaret. Think of Josephine Baker at her most {{outrageous}} taking Paris by storm.
