500|$|In the film, Ferris convinces Cameron {{to borrow}} his father's rare 1961 Ferrari GT California. [...] "The insert {{shots of the}} Ferrari were of the real 250 GT California", Hughes {{explains}} in the DVD commentary. [...] "The cars we used in the wide shots were obviously reproductions. There were only 100 of these cars, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>way</b> too expensive to destroy. We {{had a number of}} replicas made. They were pretty good, but for the tight shots I needed a real one, so we brought one in to the stage and shot the inserts with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Drummer Will Champion later {{admitted}} that Coldplay did not rush {{to complete the}} album [...] "because the prospect of touring again was so daunting that we felt we should take our time, and also {{we wanted to make}} sure that it was the best it could possibly be". According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs". Martin added that the reason why they ended up late was that they [...] "...kept [...] finishing [...] the record until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>way</b> too late... don't listen to it at the moment, because [...] just find something to go back and change." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite being a {{critical}} and commercial failure, Tank Girl {{is often said}} to have a cult following. Petty's version of Tank Girl remains a popular character at cosplay events. The music video for Avril Lavigne's 2013 song [...] "Rock n Roll" [...] was heavily influenced by Tank Girl. During her interview included on the Blu-ray release of the film in 2013, Petty was asked why she thinks the film still resonates with fans, and replied: [...] "There's no formula as to why Tank Girl was so fabulous and why people love it so much... It was unique, it was new, it was fresh, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>way</b> ahead of its time, and I'm happy that I {{got to do it}} and that I'll always have her." [...] Luke Buckmaster from the BBC included the film in his 2015 list of the [...] "ten weirdest superhero films", asserting that: [...] "at its best, director Rachel Talalay captures an ostentatious steampunk vibe that proves weirdly addictive." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Upgrade U" [...] was shot during the two-week filming for the B'Day Anthology Video Album. It was {{directed}} by Melina and Knowles herself. The video was shot between those of [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] and [...] "Green Light", and took about one and half days of filming. Jay-Z performed his rap scenes first, [...] afterwards Knowles studied his scene, and then did her impersonation of him. Melina said: [...] "If anybody knows Jay-Z, it would be Beyoncé". Knowles commented on her impersonation of Jay-Z on MTV, [...] "I love what I did in [...] because it's completely out of my character, {{or at least the}} character that people think I am. I was pretending to be Jay, and he was there, and I told him he had to leave, because I couldn't do it with him in the room — <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>way</b> too embarrassing. I think I did a pretty good job. I had the lip curl down!" [...] The video premiered on February 28, 2007, on BET's 106 & Park, with the video for Knowles' other single release, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] (2007) featuring Shakira, premiering the same day on Total Request Live (TRL).|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "All In My Head (Flex)" [...] fuses reggae and pop with trap music. The song {{is three}} minutes and thirty-seconds {{in length and}} samples the song [...] "Flex" [...] by Jamaican DJ Mad Cobra which itself {{interpolated}} elements of The Temptations' [...] "Just My Imagination". Its instrumentation consists of guitar, percussion, synthesized finger snaps and synths creating an electronic-reggae beat. The song opens with Hansen singing the chorus featuring guitar chords and crisp clicks. Following the rap performed by Fetty Wap, Ally Brooke belts out [...] the first verse: [...] "Curtains like waves closing in all around us, dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us," [...] backed by the percussion and guitar chords. Concerning his collaboration on [...] "All in My Head (Flex)", Fetty Wap told Billboard that during the recording, his voice [...] "wasn't as mature as it is now." [...] And described as [...] "impossible" [...] to performed the song on stage. [...] "Like, I smoke way too much now. No more high-range. If you were actually to hear the first version to that song, I do not sound anything like that. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>way</b> high up there. So when we changed everything I was like I don't think they {{going to like it}} because it felt like I took the energy from it. But they were like we love it, we rocking with it."

2500|$|Unlike many of The Cars' album covers, {{the cover}} for The Cars was {{designed}} by the record company, rather than drummer David Robinson. The cover was not well liked {{by the members of}} the band, however. Robinson said, [...] "I thought that when the Elektra came out <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>way</b> too slick.

From what I have heard my grandfather say, those horns over there of Mr. Ram's are nothing to brag about. No, Sir, they are nothing to brag about. One of those wild, free cousins of Mr. Ram over there would laugh at those horns. But they are funny horns, and they've been like that always {{since the days of the}} first great Ram, the great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather of all the Sheep, so my grandfather told me. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>way</b> back in those long-ago days that they became curved and quite useless for fighting, and all because of old Big-Horn going about with a chip on his shoulder." ...|$|E
