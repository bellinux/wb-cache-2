40|$|As {{part of a}} {{modification}} project {{for one of the}} fields in the North Sea, the optimal failure position of three new globe valves has been studied. In a gas compression train, the gas needs to be cooled to a set temperature, and the globe valves control the amount of cooling medium required through the heat exchangers to reach this set temperature. A wrong choice of failure position could potentially cause expensive and important process equipment to get damaged. The four failure positions that have been studied are fail open, fail close, fail close with travel stop and <b>fail</b> in <b>position.</b> Results were obtained using the simulation tools HYSYS and PIPENET, and calculations in Excel. Fail close is not an optimal failure position, but it has been considered the most optimal as of today. It is very likely that this failure position will lead to a process shut down, which will give reduced production. The reason why it is still considered the most optimal solution is that no equipment will get damaged, and the actuator solution is well proven and trustable. The results show that <b>fail</b> in <b>position</b> is the failure position which is best from a process point of view. There are however several questions connected to the actuator solution of <b>fail</b> in <b>position.</b> It is a relatively new failure position solution, which is why AKSO {{have not been able to}} get any feedback on how it works. It is very likely that <b>fail</b> in <b>position</b> will be used in similar installations in the future, when the actuator solution has been verified and improved if necessary. It has been found that fail open is the least optimal failure solution. As the heat exchanger cooling medium demand will increase significantly when the valves are left fully open, there will be deficit of cooling medium to the other cooling medium consumers. A possible consequence of this is a process shutdown to avoid overheating of important process equipment. Another possible consequence of fail open as the failure position is hydrate formation, which in worst case can lead to damages to the compressors...|$|R

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the behaviour of innovative structural beams made by gluing together a number of composite sandwich panels in the flatwise and in the edgewise positions is presented in this paper. The building block of these innovative beams is a composite sandwich structure made up of glass fibre reinforced polymer skins and modified phenolic foam core material. Four-point static bending and asymmetrical beam shear tests were conducted to evaluate the strength and stiffness of these structural beams. The effect of the number and orientation of sandwich laminations on the behaviour of the glue-laminated sandwich beams is investigated. Results showed that beams tested in the edgewise <b>position</b> <b>failed</b> with higher strength but have slightly lower bending stiffness than beams in the flatwise position. More importantly, the specimens in the edgewise <b>position</b> <b>failed</b> with greater ductility due to the progressive failure of the vertical fibre composite skins while the specimens in the flatwise <b>position</b> <b>failed</b> in a brittle manner due to compressive failure of the fibre composite skins. Under shear loading, the behaviour of the sandwich beams in the flatwise position is governed by the shear strength of the core while in the edgewise position by the shear strength of the fibre composite skin. The results of the theoretical {{evaluation of}} the flexural and shear strengths of the sandwich beams were in good agreement with the experimental results. Preliminary examination showed the high potential of glue-laminated sandwich beams for replacement of deteriorating timber structures...|$|R

Under flexural loading, the composite sandwich beams in the edgewise <b>position</b> <b>failed</b> due to progressive failure of the skin while failure in the flatwise position is in a brittle manner due to either shear failure of the core or compressive failure of the skin followed by debonding between the skin and the core.

40|$|In this paper, {{structural}} composite sandwich {{was investigated}} under 3 and 4 -point static bending {{tests in the}} flatwise and edgewise positions to analyse {{the contribution of the}} skins in the load carrying capacity and failure mode under flexure. The skins of the composite sandwich are made up of tri-axis E-glass fibres infused with epoxy resin and the core material of fly ash with low density polystyrene beads. Structural composite sandwich with span lengths of 200, 400 and 800 mm was tested until final failure. Analytical calculation of the load capacity and deflection of the composite sandwich was conducted and compared with the experimental results. Preliminary investigation showed that the percentage contribution of the skins in the flexural capacity of composite sandwich tested in the flatwise position is higher than that of the edgewise position. However, the specimen tested in the edgewise <b>position</b> <b>failed</b> at a higher load and exhibited a higher flexural stiffness. The specimens tested in the flatwise <b>position</b> <b>failed</b> due to core shear failure followed by delamination between the skin and the core. On the other hand, the specimens tested in the edgewise <b>position</b> <b>failed</b> in a brittle manner due to the simultaneous shear failure of the skin and the core. The results also showed that the flexural behaviour of the structural sandwich can be predicted analytically using the simple beam theory. For structural composite sandwich, the combined contribution of the skin and the core in carrying the load should considered to efficiently design a composite sandwich structure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental investigation into the flexural and shear behaviour of glue-laminated (glulam) fibre composite sandwich beams with a view of using this material for structural applications. The building block of these structural beams is a new generation composite sandwich structure made up of glass fibre reinforced polymer skins and high strength core material. In the experimental investigation, beams with 1, 2, 3, and 4 composite sandwich panels glued together were subjected to 4 -point static bending and asymmetrical beam shear tests in the flatwise and in the edgewise positions. The results of the flexural test showed that the glulam sandwich beams in the edgewise <b>position</b> <b>failed</b> with higher strength but have slightly lower bending stiffness than beams in the flatwise position. The results however indicated that the bending stiffness of the flatwise specimens converges to that of the edgewise specimens with increasing laminations. More importantly, the specimens in the edgewise <b>position</b> <b>failed</b> with greater ductility due to the progressive failure of the fibre composite skins while the specimens in the flatwise <b>position</b> <b>failed</b> in a brittle manner due to debonding between the skin and core. Under shear loading, the behaviour of the sandwich beams is significantly influenced by the shear strength and modulus of the fibre composite skin. It has been demonstrated that the glue-laminated sandwich beams exhibited better performance than the individual sandwich beams. The results of the study suggest the high possibility of using composite sandwich construction in the development of structural laminated beams...|$|R
40|$|Robot {{systems in}} {{critical}} applications, {{such as those}} in space and nuclear environments, must be able to operate during component failure to complete important tasks. One failure mode that has received little attention is the failure of joint position sensors. Current fault tolerant designs require the addition of directly redundant position sensors which can affect joint design. A new method is proposed that utilizes analytical redundancy to allow for continued operation during joint position sensor failure. Joint torque sensors are used with a virtual passive torque controller to make the robot joint stable without position feedback and improve position tracking performance in the presence of unknown link dynamics and end-effector loading. Two Cartesian accelerometer based methods are proposed to determine the position of the joint. The joint specific position determination method utilizes two triaxial accelerometers attached to the link driven by the joint with the <b>failed</b> <b>position</b> sensor. The joint specific method is not computationally complex and the position error is bounded. The system wide position determination method utilizes accelerometers distributed on different robot links and the end-effector to determine the position of sets of multiple joints. The system wide method requires fewer accelerometers than the joint specific method to make all joint position sensors fault tolerant but is more computationally complex and has lower convergence properties. Experiments were conducted on a laboratory manipulator. Both position determination methods were shown to track the actual position satisfactorily. A controller using the position determination methods and the virtual passive torque controller was able to servo the joints to a desired position during position sensor failure...|$|R

30|$|This paper proposes hybrid {{connectivity}} restoration (HCR) considering single-node failures, which integrates proactive {{selection and}} reactive motion. The {{selection of a}} backup node for a failure node is a proactive process. Each node identifies a backup node and is then monitored by its backup node. Once a node fails, its backup node moves to the best position that connects all the failed node’s one-hop neighbors. It triggers {{the restoration of the}} backup node and the restoration is a reactive process. HCR is a distributed and localized scheme, where each node just maintains its one-hop neighborhood information. Since a failed node only affects its direct neighbors’ connectivity, the main idea of the restoration is to move one of the failed node’s neighbors to a new position so that all the failed node’s direct neighbors can be re-connected. The node motion may trigger another disconnection on the moving node, so the restoration is a recursive process, the whole network is connected only when the motion node’s directed neighbors are connected. HCR opts to efficiently restore network connectivity through selecting the most proper backup node and moving it to the best position instead of the <b>failed</b> node’s <b>position.</b> The less distance the node moves, the less influence on the network connection. As aforementioned, only if a node failure breaks its directed neighborhood connectivity, it may further break network connectivity. The node whose failure breaks its directed neighborhood connectivity is called a critical node. On the opposite, the node is called an uncritical node. It {{should be noted that the}} uncritical node cannot be a cut vertex while the critical node may be a cut vertex. Though a critical node’s failure may not necessarily break network connectivity, it may bring unnecessary restoration. It is much more efficient and cheaper to identify a critical node and restore its direct neighbors’ connectivity than to identify a cut vertex and restore the network connectivity. To identify a cut vertex requires global information, which is impossible and inefficient in WSANs. At the same time, to identify a critical node just needs one-hop neighborhood information, and the identification is done on the node itself. Moreover, compared with moving a backup node to the <b>failed</b> node’s <b>position</b> in DCR [17], it is better to move the backup node to the position which connects all the failed node’s directed neighbors. Only when all the neighbors are on the boundary of the communication range, the backup node needs to move to the <b>failed</b> node’s <b>position.</b>|$|R
