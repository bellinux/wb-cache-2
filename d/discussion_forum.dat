5|$|Originally, the {{producers}} considered having Michael Obiora play both {{the young and}} old version of Billy Shipton. However, {{it was decided that}} Obiora in makeup would look too fake, and so Louis Mahoney was cast to play the older version. Initially, Obiora played the role with a London accent; Mahoney, however, has a thick accent. Obiora had to re-dub his lines to match. Billy mentions that the windows of the TARDIS are the wrong size for a real police box. In 2004, when the first photographs of the new series' TARDIS prop were revealed, there was a vigorous discussion of the box's dimensions on the Outpost Gallifrey Doctor Who <b>discussion</b> <b>forum,</b> in which some fans complained that the prop's windows were too big. Moffat has confirmed that this line is an in-joke aimed at the Outpost Gallifrey forum.|$|E
5|$|Cayce {{flies to}} Moscow to meet Stella {{in person and}} watch Nora work. Nora is brain damaged from an {{assassination}} attempt and can only express herself through film. At her hotel, Cayce is intercepted and drugged by Dorotea and wakes up in a mysterious prison facility. Cayce escapes; exhausted, disoriented and lost, she nearly collapses as Parkaboy, who upon Cayce's request was flown to Moscow, retrieves her and brings her to the prison where the film is processed. There Hubertus, Stella and Nora's uncle Andrei, and the latter's security employees are waiting for her. Over dinner with Cayce, the Russians reveal {{that they have been}} spying on her since she posted to a <b>discussion</b> <b>forum</b> speculating that the clips may be controlled by the Russian Mafia. They had let her track the clips to expose any security breaches in their distribution network. The Russians surrender all the information they had collected on her father's disappearance and the book ends with Cayce coming to terms with his absence while in Paris with Parkaboy, whose real name is Peter Gilbert.|$|E

40|$|<b>Discussion</b> <b>forums</b> {{are highly}} popular and widely applied tools in Web-based {{training}} (WBT) systems. Usually, <b>discussion</b> <b>forums</b> {{are places where}} learners discuss topics related to courseware, their current learning task, or the learning project they are working on. These <b>discussion</b> <b>forums</b> contain tremendous educational potential for future learners, since they contain question and answer dialogues, discussions, or examples made by previous learners. Thus, by simply reusing these <b>discussion</b> <b>forums</b> as new learning resources in WBT systems, the future learners would have very valuable learning information based on the hand-on experience of previous learners. However, implementing such a simple yet powerful idea in WBT systems is not a trivial task. Extracting useful information from <b>discussion</b> <b>forums</b> {{might be seen as}} a rather tedious task, and the results of such process leave much to be desired. In this paper we present a simple tool that solves problems related to information extraction from <b>discussion</b> <b>forums</b> and thus allows their reuse as learning resources in WBT systems...|$|R

40|$|Online <b>discussion</b> <b>forums</b> are {{a common}} element of {{teaching}} and learning within higher education institutions. Effective teaching presence is required to ensure that active online interaction encourages learners to continually share, question, debate, justify and consider multiple perspectives/solutions rather than to take a passive role. This paper investigates connections between disciplines in the use of asynchronous online <b>discussion</b> <b>forums</b> to deepen discipline knowledge. By crossing the divide between the mathematics and teacher education disciplines this paper compares and contrasts how these varied disciplines explore meaning-making within their undergraduate <b>discussion</b> <b>forums.</b> Data from undergraduate <b>discussion</b> <b>forums</b> are analysed for cognitive presence using Garrison, Anderson and Archer’s (2000) Community of Inquiry model. One outcome from this study is that discipline matters but teaching presence matters more. ...|$|R

50|$|The Internet {{creates a}} space in which people can voice their {{opinions}} and discuss political issues {{under the protection of}} anonymity. Some <b>discussion</b> <b>forums</b> are actually groups or organizations that set up discussion for a specific purpose about one issue or person in politics. Some problems with <b>discussion</b> <b>forums</b> include the lack of personal contact, which allows people not to take responsibility for posts, such as personal attacks on others. Bias is another issue of online <b>discussion</b> <b>forums</b> because many websites attract like-minded individuals, making it less likely for alternative perspectives to be introduced.|$|R
40|$|Supporting quality {{learning}} in online <b>discussion</b> <b>forums</b> is an intricate task, particularly for e-tutors aspiring to facilitate vigorous interactive learning environments. I {{argue that the}} key to successful online <b>discussion</b> <b>forums</b> is the ability of e-tutors to provide learners with feedback well informed in the meaning making and knowledge advancement processes emanating from learner interactions. In this paper, a newly developed concept of providing e-tutors with the information they require is explored, exhibiting the Event Centre (EC) concept, through which tutors are able to obtain periodic “snapshots ” of the occurrences throughout <b>discussion</b> <b>forums,</b> which highlight processes of meaning construction and knowledge advancement.
