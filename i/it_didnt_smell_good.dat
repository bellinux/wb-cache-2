The greatest portrait painters have painted both, man and the intention of his soul; Rembrandt and El Greco; it's only the second-raters who've only painted man. A {{lily of the valley}} would be lovely even if <b>it</b> <b>didn't</b> <b>smell,</b> but <b>it's</b> more lovely because it has perfume. That picture"--he pointed to Lawson's portrait--"well, the drawing's all right and so's the modelling all right, but just conventional; it ought to be drawn and modelled so that you know the girl's a lousy slut. Correctness is all very well: El Greco made his people eight feet high because he wanted to express something he couldn't get any other way." ...|$|R

It is a system invented not with any idea of getting the best results--that does not enter into the War Office philosophy--but to have a rule for everything, and avoid arguments. There is rather too generous an {{allowance}} of bread and stuff per man, and there is a very fierce but not very efficient system of weighing and checking. A rather too generous allowance is, of course, a direct incentive to waste or stealing--as any one but our silly old duffer of a War Office would know. The checking is for quantity, which any fool can understand, rather than for quality. The test for the quality of army meat is the <b>smell.</b> If <b>it</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>smell</b> bad, <b>it</b> is <b>good....</b>|$|R

5000|$|The king issued another proclamation, that {{he would}} give a measure of gold to whoever would bring him the ogre's bolster. Thirteenth said: [...] "Majesty, how is that possible? The bolster is full of little bells, and you must know that the ogre awakens at a breath." [...] "I know nothing about it," [...] said the king. [...] "I wish it at any cost." [...] Thirteenth departed, and went and crept under the ogre's bed. At midnight he {{stretched}} out his hand very softly, but the little bells all sounded. [...] "What is that?" [...] said the ogre. [...] "Nothing," [...] replied the ogress; [...] "perhaps it is the wind that makes them ring." [...] But the ogre, who was suspicious, pretended to sleep, but kept his ears open. Thirteenth stretched out his hand again. Alack! The ogre put out his arm and seized him. [...] "Now you are caught! Just wait; I will make you cry for your first trick, for your second, and for your third." [...] After this he put Thirteenth in a barrel, and began to feed him on raisins and figs. After a time he said: [...] "Stick out your finger little Thirteenth, so that I can see whether you are fat." [...] Thirteenth saw there a mouse's tail, and stuck that out. [...] "Ah, how thin you are!" [...] said the ogre; [...] "and besides, you <b>don't</b> <b>smell</b> <b>good!</b> Eat, my son; take the raisins and figs, and get fat soon!" [...] After some days the ogre told him again to put out his finger, and Thirteenth stuck out a spindle. [...] "Eh, wretch! Are you still lean? Eat, eat, and get fat soon." ...|$|R

5000|$|Lind's first {{recording}} {{session was}} at Sunset Sound with session personnel including Hal Blaine on drums, Leon Russell on piano, Henry Diltz on banjo and Carol Kaye on bass yielded four songs including [...] "Elusive Butterfly" [...] which Lind wanted to record as written with five verses: (Lind quote:) [...] "Jack {{said no one}} would listen to a song that long, and I should only do two." [...] Liberty Records wished to release a single by Lind before recording him further: (Lind quote:) [...] "The record company executives asked me which song I thought we should release as the single. I told them anything but 'Elusive Butterfly'. The execs and Jack agreed. There was just nothing like it on the charts {{at the time and}} <b>it</b> <b>didn't</b> <b>smell</b> like a hit to any of us." [...] The choice of single was the track [...] "Cheryl's Goin' Home" [...] with [...] "Elusive Butterfly" [...] - (Lind quote:)"which we thought was the weakest song" [...] - serving as B-side to prevent split airplay. In fact while [...] "Cheryl's Goin' Home" [...] upon its November 1965 release failed to generate any significant radio action, Miami area station WQAM began airing [...] "Elusive Butterfly" [...] with the track ranking in the top ten of the station's hit parade by the year's end with resultant interest from other Florida radio stations affording [...] "Elusive Butterfly" [...] regional hit status strong enough to cause Liberty Records to reissue Lind's debut single with [...] "Elusive Butterfly" [...] as A-side by in January 1966. Debuting at #83 on the Billboard Hot 100 dated 22 January 1966, [...] "Elusive Butterfly" [...] rose to the Top Ten in six weeks with its Hot 100 peak of #5 attained on the chart dated 12 March 1966.|$|R
5000|$|Anassian {{was hired}} by Yanni as a Concertmaster for the 1994 tour, as well as serving as a violin soloist. He appears on the live concert videos, Yanni Live at Royal Albert Hall and Tribute. According to Armen, Yanni hired him as a {{conductor}} [...] "on faith" [...] - as he had never watched him conduct an orchestra. [...] "That's how Yanni does many things," [...] Anassian said in a 1998 interview with the Toledo Blade.

[...] "To be honest, {{a few years ago}} when he was talking about it, the idea was so amazing. I myself was very skeptical, understandably so. But the truth is, it happened. We did it." [...] He goes on to say, [...] "I did one tour as concertmaster and I got to know Yanni very, very well." [...] "Yanni heavily relies on his instincts, and I am happy to say, they're usually good. Especially when it comes to people, when it comes to audiences, when it comes to music, and what's expected of him." [...] Anassian said the Tribute video looks great but watching it on film cannot compare to actually being at the Taj Mahal and Forbidden City concerts. [...] "It doesn't feel the same. <b>It</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>smell</b> the same," [...] he said with a laugh. [...] "It's hard to put it in a nutshell. It was a life-changing experience." [...] The contrast he encountered in India was profound. [...] "Unless you go to India...you cannot fathom that poverty and deprivation on the one hand and such overwhelming beauty as the Taj Mahal on the other hand. There was always that conflict that dominated my days in India." [...] He said that he hears from many fans about how Yanni's music has had a positive impact on their lives, but from the conductor's podium he's working too hard to notice. [...] "We're so involved in the music, we take it for granted. We do it every day." ...|$|R
50|$|Before {{checking}} {{the health of}} their elephant, visitors are given a demonstration on how to check an elephant's health. Checking their elephant's health includes checking for teeth health, intestinal health, and sweat gland health, and checking for sleeping problems. In order to check for intestinal and teeth health, visitors check their elephant's excrement. To check for intestinal problems, they are first told to count their elephant's number of droppings. If there are around six pieces per bathroom time, then the elephant is considered healthy {{because it has been}} eating enough. Elephants can eat around 300 pounds of food per day. Furthermore, visitors are asked to smell the elephant dung and make sure <b>it</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>smell</b> bad. They are also asked to squeeze the dung to make sure it is not too watery. To check for teeth problems, visitors check to see if the dung is finely ground. If for example whole leaves are found in the dung, then the elephant's teeth are not working properly. Elephants have 6 sets of teeth in their lifetime, and lose their last set of teeth near the end of their life. If their food is not being properly chewed, this means they are old and nearing the end of their life. To checked sweat gland health, visitors touch near the base of their elephant's toenails to check for sweat. To check for sleeping problems, visitors check to see if their elephant has dirt on its sides. This is because elephants, who sleep for only around four hours a night, sleep on their sides while sleeping deeply. If they do not have dirt marks on their sides, then they slept standing up. Elephants who sleep standing up are generally sick. After the elephants' health has been checked, visitors are given a branch with leaves to sweep the dirt off their elephant's backs. To do this, visitors are told to gently pull on their elephant's ear to get them to sit down. The next stage in cleaning their elephant is when visitors and their elephants are led to a nearby waterfall bathing area. This is where the visitors begin to brush and bathe their elephant. To bathe their elephant, they toss water from the bathing area onto them with buckets. Visitors brush their elephant with hard-bristled brushes to get the dirt off of them. Bathing them is important, since when riding them dirt could get pushed into their skin and cause it to get infected.|$|R

This study investigates young people’s attitudes toward {{and beliefs about}} these alternative tobacco products. The study used data from a convenience sample survey of 5, 016 7 th- through 12 th-grade students in Massachusetts. The cigar attitudes receiving the highest endorsement levels were that cigars <b>smell</b> <b>good</b> and are something different to try, whereas the item receiving the lowest endorsement was that cigars {{give you a good}} buzz.
