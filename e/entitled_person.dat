40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyze a {{position}} of an <b>entitled</b> <b>person</b> {{in the process of}} enforcement obligation, which was adjudged by a judicial decision and wasn't fulfilled by an obliged person voluntarily. The paper is focused on the enforcement of private, pecuniary obligations. Execution procedure and all described institutes are observed from the entitled person's point of view, particularly with regard to her fundamental effort to satisfy her claim. The thesis also deals with the entitled person's options to face the obliged person's means of defense, especially deferral and discontinuance of the execution. The aim is to evaluate the current legislation's adjustment of the position of the <b>entitled</b> <b>person</b> and to try to suggest possibilities of change which could provide more effective execution for the <b>entitled</b> <b>person</b> while preserving the obliged person's rights. The thesis is divided into four chapters.

40|$|In legal writing various views {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{with respect to}} the consent of the <b>entitled</b> <b>person.</b> According to the prevailing view, {{it is one of the}} conditions eliminating the unlawfulness of the infringement of personal interests. However, the proponents of this view admit that consent fulfills many functions. It may eliminate the very infringement of some personal interests (image, secrecy of mail). The most important function of consent consists in its capacity to eliminate the unlawfulness of behaviour. The article contains the analysis of the above problems on the basis of Polish civil law. It does not consider penal law issues. The author is of the opinion that providing for the conditions of validity of consent in the amended Civil Code is not necessary. According to a rather generally accepted view, the consent of the <b>entitled</b> <b>person</b> is a unilateral revokable legal action Legal consequences occur here irrespective of the intention of the acting behavior. The borderline between the consent of the <b>entitled</b> <b>person</b> and the activity undertaken at one's own risk is blurred. The article contains a detailed analysis of the application of consent. The consent of the <b>entitled</b> <b>person</b> is very important in medical treatment. In principle, any treatment, especially surgery, requires the consent of the patient. Similar situation takes place in matters of special interest today (e. g. the admissibility of ex vivo transplants). Here, very strict criteria of consent should be applied. Next, the author discusses the application of consent in sport. The participation in brutal or dangerous sport competitions (especially in boxing) is tantamount to the consent to slight bodily injury and infringement of personal inviolability. The article contains also the analysis of the consequences of consent in the sphere of protection of other personal interests (especially privacy). In the sphere of personal interest protection the Roman Law adage volenti non jit iniuria is of limited significance. The intencity of personal interests protection would be weakened if too wide application of the construction of consent were adopted. Its subjective and objective premises must be precisely determined. There is no uniform answer to the question of how the freedom of decision of a person who gives his/her consent is shaped...|$|E
40|$|A pension is {{a benefit}} of cash character, which {{aim is to}} secure the {{material}} existence in the period, in which an individual, regarding to age {{is not able to}} perform work.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{political}} persecution {{as a reason}} for which international protection is granted. Firstly, it discusses what role persecution on political grounds has played in the past, and how the <b>entitled</b> <b>person</b> is provided with protection as a result. The following chapter assesses the way political persecution is included in the relevant international law norms, as well as European law norms, which are an important source of the legal regulation of granting international protection in the European Union. As an example of how Member States respect both international and European commitments in their national legislation, the thesis reveals the laws and regulations made applicable in the Czech Republic. The crux of this thesis centres around the interpretation of different terms which are crucial for granting international protection on political grounds. This is the imperative, determining factor of the decision-making process in individual cases. Chapter 4 compares the legal regulation of political persecution in two regional legal subsystems, European and Inter-American, and incorporating international and regional commitments in the national legislation on the American continent is demonstrated on the relevant US laws.

40|$|Deferral and {{discontinuance}} of {{the enforcement}} of judgment (execution) Carrying out {{the enforcement of}} the judgement represents a rather great impact on the obliged person's rights. Despite {{the fact that it is}} this obliged person who has caused such enforcement by not fulfilling voluntarily what has been imposed upon him by the enforceable decision, the law has to provide a certain standard of protection. Thus, in the Czech legal environment, it creates above all a deferral and discontinuance of the enforcement of judgement (execution). The main purpose of this thesis is to focus on these two institutes and also on costs in connection with them as they are a concern not only for the obliged person but for the <b>entitled</b> <b>person</b> as well. The thesis is divided into four chapters. While the first one presents general information about the enforcement of judgement and execution, its legal sources and difference between both concepts, the main part of the thesis lies in the three following chapters.

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{question}} whether civil-law protection of personar interests (Art. 23 and 24 of the Civil Code) is based on the subjective right conception. The author presents his standpoint with respect to the following controversies concerning various aspects of personal interests protection. First, he rejects the view that the immanent link between the person and his/her personal interests, i. e. the inseparability of a subject and an object of a right makes it impossible to adopt the construction of a subjective right. The author proves first that the notion of an object of a right is not a necessary element of a subjective right and that the essence of a subjective right lies in its regulative functions with respect to behaviours of others and not in delimiting the sphere of exclusiveness for a subject with respect to a separate object. Besides, the author proves also {{that in the case of}} personal interests the inseparatedness of a subject and an object does not actually take place because there are numerous individual attributes of human personality which do not come within the notion of legal capacity and thus require separate civil-law protection. Next, the author declares for an objective (intersubjective) conception of personal interests and for the conception of plurality of personal rights. The author then states that although there must always be a statutory basis for creating „erga omnes" rights, the degree of precision of the statutory formulation of those rights may vary and thus it is possible to construe „erga omnes" rights protecting interests which — though not mentioned in Art. 23 of the Civil Code — are nonetheless accepted in some way by the legal system. As to the presumption of unlawfulness of the infringement of a personal interest, the author states that each such infringement should be qualified as the infringement of a personal right, and that the criteria of evaluating the unlawfulness are to be of objective character, i. e. are to be based on normative grounds and subsidiarily on the grounds of principles of social coexistence. Similar criteria should be applied to the evaluation of conflicting interests. A generally accepted view that a prevailing social or individual interest may eliminate the unlawfulness does not in any way weaken the construction of a subjective right as a means of protecting personal interests. In turn, a view that a consent of an <b>entitled</b> <b>person</b> is a circumstance eliminating the unlawfulness of an infringement is fully in agreement with the conception of a subjective right. Namely, a consent is an expression of the freedom of decision with respect to one's own interests, and as such is the way of executing one's own subjective rights. Finally, the author analyses other constructions which might be used for the protection of human interests. In particular, he comments on „legal reflexes", tort liability, and the so-called „institutional protection". Neither of them meets the standards offered by the subjective right conception. The first does not stress adequately the fact that general duties originate in the individual interest of the <b>entitled</b> <b>person,</b> the second is based on guilt as one of the premisses of protection, and the third — being centered on the protection of supra-individual interests indicated in „the institution" — would be drastically in conflict with the very sense of introducing the protection regulated in Art. 24 of the Civil Code, aimed at safeguarding individual and not supra-individual interests.

40|$|My {{hypothesis}} {{is that we can}} derive the normative conditions that institutions and institutional acts have to meet in order to be rationally acceptable/recognizable from the logical structure of institutional reality. Developing Searle's achievements on the constitutive role of speech acts in the construction of institutional reality and on their character of institutional acts, I'll show that the same types of constitutive rules underlying illocutionary acts also underlie institutional reality. I’ll then argue that we can derive a specific set of normative criteria for the rational criticizability of institutional acts from these constitutive rules {{in the same way that}} we can derive normative criteria for the rational criticizability of illocutionary acts from the constitutive rules underlying speech acts and communicative interactions If so we could face the issue of the quality of the collective acceptance/recognition (rationally motivated or distorted by external factors) and, therefore, of the “justness” of the institution created and maintained by collective acceptance/recognition. I will therefore propose to integrate Searle's constitutive rules of speech acts with a criterion of “fairness” prescribing a further dimension of assessment concerning the human dignity and the fundamental human rights of all the interested parties. I will show that there are cases where speech or institutional acts can be rationally criticized even though they meet the abovementioned validity claims or criteria: an order, for example, can be given by an institutionally <b>entitled</b> <b>person</b> and addressed to a person who can do the specified action and has deontic reasons to obey. However, it can still be rationally “unfair” I'll argue for the extension of this criterion of fairness to institutional reality...|$|E

They arrived at Lungi before sunset and were joined by the remaining elements of 1 PARA the next morning. The soldiers were able to deploy rapidly and with minimal equipment, knowing that they would not have to wait long for the ARG's reinforcements and supplies should they be needed. The soldiers immediately set about securing the areas that would be vital to an evacuation, including the Mamy Yoko hotel, which became the evacuation centre, and Lungi airport. Jones requested in the afternoon of 8 May that Richards commence the evacuation—codenamed Operation Palliser—which Richards did almost immediately. <b>Entitled</b> <b>persons</b> who wished to leave were instructed to assemble at the Mamy Yoko hotel.

40|$|AbstractThe {{right of}} {{pre-emption}} {{can be characterized}} as a legal relationship following either statutory or contractual provisions, that establishes rights and obligations between the <b>entitled</b> <b>person</b> (eligible person) and the obliged person (owner) as two parties to the relationship. The content of this relationship is first of all the legitimate right of the eligible person to be offered by the obliged person to buy a particular thing and the corresponding obligation of the owner to offer the thing if it shall be sold. The purpose of the pre-emption right is to secure a priority status of the eligible person as regards the potential acquisition of the subject of pre-emption right. The pre-emptive right may be established in particular through rules provided directly by the law. The law may establish pre-emption rights in various situations. Most often it is the right of co-owners by shares to buy the share or shares offered for sale by other co-owners. This right was dominating to the relationship of the co-owners by share until the entry into force of the Civil Code No. 89 / 2012 Coll. as part of a general regulation of co-ownership. Its infringement brought along relative nullity of the legal act on the transfer of the ownership share. This paper deals with two question connected to the pre-emption right that have been subject to modifications {{on the basis of the}} entry into force of the new Civil Code, Act. No. 89 / 2012 Coll. by 1 January 2014. First of all, it analyses the narrowed scope of the statutory pre-emption rights of co-owners by shares and its possible impact on their mutual relations in practice. Subsequently, the paper focuses on the conceptual change of the relative nullity of the transfer of property carried out in violation of the statutory pre-emption right and the procedural consequences thereof...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{attendance}} allowance {{and the control}} process over its usage in people aged 18 and over. Process of entitlement for attendance allowance is governed by the Act on Social Services. Attendance allowance is provided to people who, because of long-term adverse health condition, need assistance of another individual {{to care for them}} and to ensure their self-sufficiency. The purpose of this benefit is to enable the <b>entitled</b> <b>person</b> to ensure care and choose the provider of necessary assistance through providers of social services or related person. Local authority decides specified degree of dependence and also carries out checks of usage of the benefit. A proposal to amend the Act is currently being discussed with the aim to adjust the system of social services in a way to take into account findings from practice, in particular in the area of clear conditions of entitlement and use of the attendance allowance. The objective of the thesis is to find out impacts of upcoming changes in recipients of attendance allowance in the 1 st degree of dependence and to make a survey of experience of social workers with checks of usage of the benefit. To achieve the objective a questioning method was used, the technique of semi-structured interview, secondary analysis of data and participant observation. The research has shown that in recipients in 1 st degree of dependence the attendance allowance is paid in the amount which does not correspond to actual costs incurred to provide the assistance. It can therefore be assumed that reduction in the allowance would not endanger provision of necessary care. Interest in social services is not likely to increase by payment of the allowance in 1 st degree of dependence by means of vouchers. Futhermore, it was found out that there are not any explicit methodical guidelines which would describe implementation of controls over usage of the allowance. More specific definition of control activities would enable to carry out controls more effectively and transparently. Implementation of more controls is possible only under the condition of increasing staff numbers of administrative authorities...|$|E
