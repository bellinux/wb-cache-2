40|$|A new {{technology}} of composite micromachining of laser and electrolysis is presented {{through a combination}} of technological advantages of laser processing and <b>electrolytic</b> <b>machining.</b> The implication of its method is that laser processing efficiently removes metallic materials and that pulse <b>electrolytic</b> <b>machining</b> removes recast layer and controls shape precisely. Machining accuracy and efficiency can be improved. The impacts that electrolyte fluid effectively cools the microstructure edge in the laser machining process and that gas-liquid two-phase flow makes the electrolyte conductivity produce uneven distribution in the electrolytic processing are considered. Some approximate assumptions are proposed on the actual conditions of machining process. The mathematical model of composite micromachining of laser and electrolysis based on the electrolyte fluid is built. The validity of the model can be verified by experimentation. The experimental results show that processing accuracy meets accuracy requirements which are Â± 0. 05 [*]mm. Machining efficiency increases more than 20 percent compared to electrolytic processing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM) of polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) involves high-temperature melting that easily produces cracks on the silicon surface. This paper studies improvements of cracks and craters on surface of polysilicon after wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (WEDM) by magnetic force-assisted <b>electrolytic</b> <b>machining</b> (MFA-EM). The effects of different MFA-EM parameters on material removal and surface roughness are explored to understand the machining characteristics of MFA-EM and how magnetic field assistance contributes to high-efficiency and high-quality machining. Experimental results show that compared with standard EM, MFA-EM can achieve better machining efficiency and surface quality because MFA-EM can effectively enhance electrolyte circulation and replenishment, which contributes to better machining stability...|$|E

Also in the post war period an automated casting machine was installed in 1948, and two new blast furnaces activated in 1958, and 1961, a mill for steel rod and wire production was commissioned in 1964. The sixth blast furnace began operation in 1967, and a second oxy-steel plant in 1968.

40|$|LectureThis paper {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and evaluation of impeller efficiency and overall compressor performance {{as they relate to}} specific impeller manufacturing methods, manufacturing tolerances, and quality control. The manufacturing process used in the construction of an impeller has a direct influence on the impeller?s performance The authors explain and compare different manufacturing methods and introduce the Taguchi Method Application as an available tool for statistical evaluation of key manufacturing parameters influence on impeller performance. As a best practice, manufacturing techniques for one piece impeller production are presented. In the case of high pressure centrifugal compressor applications with very narrow tip width impellers, and corrosive gas applications requiring special materials, EDM (Electrical Discharge Machining) and ECM (<b>Electrolytic</b> <b>Machining)</b> can be applied as a manufacturing process to improve quality control over conventional manufacturing methods. In response to a compressor performance discrepancy encountered during OEM FAT, a review was initiated into improving quality control and performance prediction based on enhanced impeller manufacturing processes for narrow tip width impellers. In this analysis, two compressor rotors are evaluated and compared; the first using traditional, two piece welded impellers and the second with one piece impellers machined via EDM and ECM. The resulting data from both series of tests suggests a significant improvement in individual impeller performance, as well as overall compressor performance for the single piece impeller compared to the two piece impeller...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{the concept of}} an in situ <b>electrolytic</b> processor, a <b>machine</b> with electrochemical functions that purifies aqueous fluids at the point of production, whether from a bore water supply or effluent from a tannery. Where the contaminants in an effluent are useful they are separated in a specialised electrolyser for re-use in the process that produced the original effluent. The value in doing this exceeds the cost of electrolytic processing for tannery effluent. The functions of an electrolytic purifier were resolved into: flotation by bubbles, flocculation by corrosion of aluminium anodes, electrowinning by cathodic plating, disinfection, oxidation-reduction and pH modification. Improved understanding of the control of these functions has led to the ability to design better electrolysers because the functions were combined in a form that was appropriate to the required purification process. A link between extra-faradic corrosion of an aluminium anode and pH modification is postulated. Electrochemical principles were used as the basis for development of real processor models. These models were tested using bore water, cooling tower fluid, virus contaminated water, laundry water, municipal waste water, landfill leachate and pulp mill effluent. The most effective model, designed {{during the course of the}} project and described as the Flume, incorporated a novel corroding anode composed of thin pieces of aluminium, water flow in a cathodic flume, and a cheap water-porous membrane to separate the electrolyte into anolyte and catholyte. The novel anode was designed to improve clearance of corrosion products by maintaining a fast flow speed in proximity to the zone of anodic corrosion. The Flume model was used in an extensive test at a tannery. Greater than 90 % of chromium in tannery effluent was removed by a combination of electroflocculation and electroflotation, at a lower cost than by treatment using standard chemical flocculent, using a side-stream Flume processor at a tannery. A smaller scale Flume model was used to test mechanisms of treatment in the laboratory using synthetic tannery effluent. When treating alkaline effluent, the separating membrane in the Flume model enabled production of alkali at the cathode and production of acid at the anode. This was used for pH modification of effluent and, where the majority of the flow was anolyte, was able to produce a catholyte of pH greater than 13 from a wide range of inflow pH. The caustic catholyte is a valuable by-product of the electrolytic processing, especially when the upstream processes require net input of alkali (as is the case at a tannery or kraft pulp mill) and more generally because downstream biological treatment processes benefit from receiving neutralised effluent. The degree of pH moderation of the whole outflow compared to the inflow was found to be controllable by adjustment of cell voltage. This effect enables treatment of effluent with variable pH. Optimisation of an electrolyser for energy recovery, by both reduction of electrode over-potentials and electrolyte resistance, was incorporated in the full-scale designs. Based on a feasible cell voltage of 5 V, 20 % recovery of the energy input is expected...|$|R
