Lower income households pay much higher water prices than higher income households because of their lack of access to water service providers.|$|R
25|$|UE’s {{policy on}} {{salaries}} is {{deeply rooted in}} UE’s philosophy of unionism. UE sees unionism as a movement and unions as independent organizations of workers.

In UE's view, salaries for union officers and staff that are comparable to those of corporate executives tend to undermine a union’s commitment to its fundamental purpose.|$|E

Statewide, the median income of rental households is 47% of the median for homeowners, and in Middlesex County it is slightly more than 50%. In Framingham, the median renter income of $33,626 is 45% of the median homeowner income of $75,040.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} the NEP on wealth {{distribution}} are disputed. The Gini index declined from 51.3 in 1970 to 44.6 in 1997, and 1987 figures indicated the mean income of the Malays had improved relative to both the Chinese and Indian communities. However, some have used 1997 statistics with 70.2 percent of households in the bottom 40 percent income group as Bumiputra, and 62.7 percent of households in the top 20 percent <b>income</b> <b>bracket</b> as non-Bumiputra, to argue that inequities remain. The Gini index also began to increase in the 1990s, going from 44.6 to 46.4 between 1990 and 1995; meanwhile, 1997 figures indicated that Chinese incomes were increasing at a rate double that of Malays'. Intra-ethnic income differences also increased markedly, especially among Malays.|$|E
25|$|On {{the issue}} of whether most Americans do not stay put in any one <b>income</b> <b>bracket,</b> Krugman quotes from 2011 CBO {{distribution}} of income study Household income measured over a multi-year period is more equally distributed than income measured over one year, although only modestly so. Given the fairly substantial movement of households across income groups over time, it might seem that income measured {{over a number of years}} should be significantly more equally distributed than income measured over one year. However, much of the movement of households involves changes in income that are large enough to push households into different income groups but not large enough to greatly affect the overall distribution of income. Multi-year income measures also show the same pattern of increasing inequality over time as is observed in annual measures.|$|E
25|$|A major {{result of}} the full {{employment}} at high wages was a sharp, long lasting decrease {{in the level of}} income inequality (Great Compression). The {{gap between rich and poor}} narrowed dramatically in the area of nutrition, because food rationing and price controls provided a reasonably priced diet to everyone. White collar workers did not typically receive overtime and therefore the gap between white collar and blue collar income narrowed. Large families that had been poor during the 1930s had four or more wage earners, and these families shot to the top one-third <b>income</b> <b>bracket.</b> Overtime provided large paychecks in war industries, and average living standards rose steadily, with real wages rising by 44% in the four years of war, while the percentage of families with an annual income of less than $2,000 fell from 75% to 25% of the population.|$|E

The other type of Swedish payroll tax is the income tax withheld (PAYE), which consists of municipal, county, and, for higher <b>income</b> <b>brackets,</b> state tax. In most municipalities, the income tax comes to approximately 30 percent, with the two higher <b>income</b> <b>brackets</b> paying a total of 50 or 55 percent respectively.

500|$|The school {{privileges}} {{its financial}} independence and accessibility over sufficient budgeting, {{a result of}} Leue's governance choices. The Free School does not receive government funding and instead subsists on student tuition and supplemental income from rental properties and [...] "extensive fundraising".

In 2012, one half the school's students lived in Albany's inner-city South End (mostly black and Latino, with a burgeoning immigrant population), one fourth lived in uptown neighborhoods, and one fourth lived in the suburbs. Leue initially struggled to recruit children of upwardly mobile families, who thought the school would limit their children's chances to join a suitable <b>income</b> <b>bracket.</b> She found that low-income, black families were the most skeptical about the school's usefulness. The school also provides inexpensive (or free) preschool and daycare for young children, operates a car collective (wherein a dozen people share a minivan), and provides low-interest loans through a community credit system.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is little}} {{data on the}} {{percentage}} of people with bulimia in general populations. Most studies conducted thus far have been on convenience samples from hospital patients, high school or university students. These have yielded a wide range of results: between 0.1% and 1.4% of males, and between 0.3% and 9.4% of females. [...] Studies on time trends in the prevalence of bulimia nervosa have also yielded inconsistent results. According to Gelder, Mayou and Geddes (2005) bulimia nervosa is prevalent between 1 and 2 percent of women aged 15–40 years. Bulimia nervosa occurs more frequently in developed countries and in cities, with one study finding that bulimia is five times more prevalent in cities than in rural areas. There is a perception that bulimia is most prevalent amongst girls from middle-class families; however, in a 2009 study girls from families in the lowest <b>income</b> <b>bracket</b> studied were 153 percent more likely to be bulimic than girls from the highest <b>income</b> <b>bracket.</b>|$|E
