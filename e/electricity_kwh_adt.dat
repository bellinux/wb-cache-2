The system will analyze a captured image of the <b>electricity</b> <b>kWh</b> meter display using character recognition method. Prior to applying this method, each photo image of the kWh meter display will be pre-processed (i. e. converting the image to grayscale and determining the threshold). To detect the kWh meter display area, a smearing approach will be applied which connected the component labeling to character segmentation. To recognize each number, a template matching will be used. This study show that these steps were not yields good result in recognizing {{the characters in the}} <b>electricity</b> <b>kWh</b> meter. This is due to several factors, such as the persistence of noise that interfered with the character recognition, camera angles, lighting effect and the effect of the smearing limit...|$|R

30|$|The {{economics}} of WECS principally {{depends on the}} operator-specific boundary conditions. A simplified approach {{to calculate the cost}} of <b>electricity</b> per <b>kWh</b> includes investment cost, operation and maintenance cost and capital cost. The investment cost of a wind turbine includes basic cost, extras, foundation, grid connection, planning and licensing.

The strategy here is to not calculate everything in the simulation model and instead provide results, which can be verified, to calculate the used resources from. E.g. from the amount of processing time for a machine {{it is possible to}} calculate the used energy. From the used resources upstream processes required to produce the resources can be included to get a total emission for the production, e.g. if the emissions to produce one <b>kWh</b> <b>electricity</b> is 0.1 kgCO2 then the 4 <b>kWh</b> <b>electricity</b> used in a machine give an emission of 0.4 kgCO2.

50|$|Energy Saving Module(s)(ESM) {{represent}} a green technology {{that reduces the}} <b>electricity</b> consumption (<b>kWh)</b> and maximum demand (kW) of air conditioning and refrigeration compressors. The concept was first developed in Australia in 1983 by Abbotly Technologies and is now distributed by Smartcool Systems Inc. The system {{works in conjunction with}} existing HVAC controls ensuring that the compressors work at maximum efficiency, while maintaining preset temperature levels. By preventing over-cycling by a process, known as ‘Compressor Optimisation' consumption of electricity is cut by between 15% and 25% in each case, thereby improving operating costs and cutting emission of greenhouse gases.|$|R
50|$|The ESM is a {{microcomputer}} that {{records the}} absolute switching {{values of the}} primary controller and also measures the 'rate of change' of both {{the rise and fall}} of temperatures during the operating cycle of the compressors. With this data the ESM computes a reference heat load to match the cooling capacity and then calculates variable operating parameters. This calculation is used to minimise compressor operation within the absolute switching values, with a resultant reduction in refrigeration and air conditioning compressor run time, reduced <b>electricity</b> consumption (<b>kWh)</b> and maximum demand (kW/KVA). This is achieved while maintaining the original operating temperature.|$|R
40|$|One way {{to analyze}} the {{electricity}} consumption of households are using thecalculation method in statistical science, namely Trend Linear Least Square Method. With this linear trend can be calculated trend value of electricity consumption foreach household. The formula used is:Where: Y t = Total <b>electricity</b> consumption (in <b>KWH)</b> a = Constantb = coefficientt = t YearsThe value of a (constant) and b (coefficient) was first found by calculating the valueof t I (annual coding), the value of Y i (the use of <b>electricity</b> in <b>KWH),</b> t i 2, and t i Y ivalue. After that specify the number of t i, Y i, t i 2, and t i Y i. Then determine thevalues of a and b. Then the equation of linear trend can be determined based on thevalue of a and b of this. Finally {{the values of the}} trend of electricity consumptionevery month can be obtained by using the linear trend equations. Based on the trend, it is concluded fluctuations in electricity consumption of eachhousehold, whether increased or decreased each month in the period 2001 - 2003.

The CAES plant parameters were adapted to the requirements of existing equipment (compressors, expanders and heat exchangers). A complete exergy analysis of the plant was performed. Most component cost data were procured from the market, asking specific quotations to the industrial providers.

40|$|A {{pilot study}} was {{undertaken}} in Newfoundland and Labrador {{to determine whether}} provision of a real-time feedback device is sufficient to provide residential customers with the information needed to reduce their electricity consumption. A panel based econometric methodology, which controlled for such factors as weather, appliance and housing stock, and demographic determinants influencing electricity consumption, was used to quantify the impacts of the realtime monitor in reducing energy (kWh) use. The study also provided some important insights about socio-economic factors that influence conservation responsiveness, a feature that may assist in developing targeted energy efficiency programs. For example, the electric water heating households showed a higher savings than non-electric water heating households. While positive attitudes toward conservation significantly increase the reduction in electricity when using the real-time monitor, seniors, in their employment of the real-time monitor, do not conserve as much. Overall, the aggregate reduction in <b>electricity</b> consumption (<b>kWh)</b> across {{the study sample was}} 18. 1 %.
