5|$|At {{its peak}} during the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, {{the area was}} the center of the Deme of Euonymos, one of the most populous {{communities}} of Ancient Athens. Euonymos had its own acropolis, theater, industrial installations, and religious festivals. Several Euonymeians played a major role in Athenian politics and civic life, most notably <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> of Socrates and in the expeditions of the Peloponnesian War.|$|E
5|$|Further, the Court {{disapproved of}} the judge's having asked the jury for the {{proportions}} of their deadlock (even {{though he did not}} ask how many were for conviction and how many were for acquittal). In Brasfield v. United States (1926), citing Burton, the Court held that such was reversible error, regardless of whether the defendant objected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> court.|$|E

5|$|Pilecki's show {{trial and}} {{execution}} {{was part of}} a wider campaign of repression against former Home Army members and others connected with the Polish Government-in-Exile in London.

Józef Cyrankiewicz, the chief prosecution witness, was already dead, and Łapiński died in 2004, before the trial was concluded.|$|E

5|$|A new, {{permanent}} job with Trinidad Leaseholds allowed Constantine {{to devote more}} time to cricket. Constantine realised that to succeed as a professional cricketer, he needed to improve; his bowling lacked true speed and, when batting, he was often dismissed playing shots that were too adventurous. After his relative failure in 1926, he increased his level of practice, improved his fitness and trained to become a slip fielder to conserve his energies for genuine fast bowling. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> matches before the 1928 tour of England, Constantine secured his place on the tour by taking five for 32 and scoring 63. He left behind his wife Norma, whom he had married in 1927, and his newly-born daughter.|$|E

Clarke Productions and in 2001 he signed with Infinity Productions.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the case}} was filed in the Western District of Wisconsin, the judge there recused himself {{as a friend of}} the magazine. The case was {{therefore}} brought before Judge Robert W. Warren, a judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Because of the sensitive nature of information at stake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, would not accept security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the in camera hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E
5|$|C. L. R. James {{believes}} that St Hill planned to play professional cricket in England around this point, but his failure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> matches {{meant that he}} was not selected to tour England with the West Indies team in 1923. James records how upset St Hill's supporters were by his omission and they believed the West Indian selectors feared a black batsman being successful in England. He also describes St Hill became more single-minded and less willing to moderate his approach after this decision.|$|E

In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Janelle Monáe, Jidenna, and other BLM activists marched through North Philadelphia to bring awareness to police brutality and Black Lives Matter.

5|$|In {{modern times}} the witches {{have become the}} {{inspiration}} for Pendle's tourism and heritage industries, with local shops selling a variety of witch-motif gifts. Burnley's Moorhouse's produces a beer called Pendle Witches Brew, {{and there is a}} Pendle Witch Trail running from Pendle Heritage Centre to Lancaster Castle, where the accused witches were held before their trial. The X43 bus route run by Burnley Bus Company has been branded The Witch Way, with some of the vehicles operating on it named after the witches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial.</b> Pendle Hill, which dominates the landscape of the area, continues to be associated with witchcraft, and hosts a hilltop gathering every Halloween.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, high scores in cricket matches were {{becoming}} more common as pitches improved, and in the summer of 1880, Roe gave a prelude to his record breaking of the following year when he hit 223 in a one-day match against his former school. In competitive, albeit second-class, county cricket, his scores remained significantly lower. Nor did he impress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> matches at Cambridge in his second year, resulting in him not appearing for the university that season.|$|E

Garry pleaded guilty to murders, and forensic evidence has linked him to a wood-carving chisel used to commit the murders. Black {{has been asked to}} construct an offender profile for Garry, to determine whether the man is sufficiently dangerous to society for a judge to issue a death penalty. Garry himself is asking to be executed.|$|E
