40|$|One of {{the main}} {{questions}} in bilingualism is whether the representations activated from one language influence processing of the other language. The current study investigated this issue by examining masked phonological priming effects in Japanese-English bilinguals when English words (e. g., guy) were primed by phonologically related logographic (Kanji) words (e. g., 害, /gai/, “harm”) and also when English words (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>guide)</b> were primed by phonologically similar phonogram (Katakana) words (e. g.,サイド, /saido/,”side”). In Experiment 1, lexical decisions to English words were facilitated when they were preceded by phonologically similar versus dissimilar primes, particularly when the primes were one-Kanji words {{and when they were}} Katakana words. Experiment 2 generally replicated Experiment 1, and showed priming effects in event-related potentials, although the effects were somewhat different from the behavioral data. The results are discussed with regard to the role of phonological activation in bilingual word recognition...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{presence}} of local minima {{is one of the}} major problems in high-dimensional image registration, only a few experimental works have been carried out to address this problem. In this study, a 3 D- 2 D vascular image feature-based registration is done by producing Digital Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) of 3 D images to match against the target 2 D images. In addition, we propose a global optimization method based on the use of Powell’s method at different resolution levels. To search the global minimum as effectively as possible, a large set of sample test points are systematically generated. The values of dissimilarity to the registered images in lower resolution environment are calculated. Powell’s method is then applied to those test points with the lowest values for further minimization in the higher resolution. It is experimentally shown that our method can identify the global optimum in a normal clinical setting. The findings can have potential usage in the reconstruction of 3 D models (e. <b>g.</b> <b>guide</b> wires) based on 2 D medical visual information. ...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 93 - 102 Nowadays {{variable}} speed drive systems (VSDS) are preferred to constant speed drives in {{the oil and gas}} industry because they can improve the efficiency of the process while avoiding the use of complex mechanical mechanisms (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>guide</b> vanes) or plant recycling and throttling. However, the reputation of VSDS has not always been favorable since they can be a cause of torsional vibration problems. This is mainly due to the intrinsic nature of switching-based electrical systems to produce pulsating torque ripple on the shaft. In addition, closed-loop electromechanical interactions could lead to system instability. The aim of this paper is to introduce a new combined approach to deal with torsional phenomena, especially in high shaft-power applications such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) trains. Besides the conventional shaft-line modal analysis, a precise understanding of the electromechanical interactions in achieved through combined simulations between the shaft-line designer (compressor manufacturer) and the VSDS supplier together with a full-load-full-speed (FLFS) train string test. Simulations and string test results confirmed satisfactory torsional behavior and electromechanical stability of the overall system...|$|E
40|$|Interest {{in outdoor}} {{education}} has grown significantly over recent decades, {{and with this}} interest has come a growth in literature about outdoor education in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Much of this literature was collated in 1989 (Bailey, 1989). The present bibliography updates the 1989 effort with the added dimension of annotations {{in the form of}} an abstract for each publication listed. The publications listed include empirical research reports as well as literature that has a descriptive, conceptual or policy focus. This bibliography is targeted principally toward those undertaking academic studies related to outdoor education. For this reason, material dealing solely with venues, equipment and activity ideas for outdoor education (e. <b>g.</b> <b>guide</b> books, activity manuals and technical books) has been excluded. Additionally, the latter publications are numerous and relatively easily accessible. This bibliography is a collation of material less readily available, but nonetheless valuable. The authors have noted the quality and quantity of information on outdoor education emanating from conferences. To increase awareness of this comprehensive source of information and to make it more readily available, individual conference papers as well as complete conference proceedings have been referenced...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the fast}} growing {{nature of the}} {{adventure}} tourism industry and the commodification of adventure activities therein, improved understanding of adventure tourism experiences and mountaineer adventure tourists in particular is needed. In an effort to move beyond traditional market segmentation approaches, this study analysed autoethnographical data from an adventure tourism mountaineering experience in Bolivia. This autoethnographic method facilitated {{a deeper understanding of}} mountaineering adventure tourism experiences and allowed for a multifaceted view of risk perceptions that has often been neglected in the literature. Data were analysed with a robust psychological framework (i. e. reversal theory) that was used to explain: (a) paradoxical desires for risk and safety in adventure tourism and (b) emotional and motivational fluctuations experienced by mountaineer adventure tourists. The importance of creating a ‘protective frame’ to ensure enjoyable experiences was identified, along with key factors that influenced this frame (e. <b>g.</b> <b>guide</b> behaviour, equipment, safety management procedures, other tourists, environmental conditions). Implications for adventure tourism practitioners are discussed, along with theoretical analyses. The utility of autoethnographic research in adventure settings, particularly in conjunction with established psychological theory, is highlighted and suggested as a fruitful avenue through which to enhance the adventure tourism discourse...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} of hydro power units, especially the governor system model for different operating conditions, based on the basic version of the software TOPSYS. The mathematical model consists of eight turbine equations, one generator equation, and one governor equation, which are solved for ten unknown variables. The generator and governor equations, which are different under various operating conditions, are presented and discussed in detail. All the essential non-linear factors in the governor system (dead-zone, saturation, rate limiting, and backlash) are also considered. Case studies are conducted based on one Swedish hydro power plant (HPP) and three Chinese plants. The simulation and on-site measurements are compared for start-up, no-load operation, normal operation, and load rejection in different control modes (frequency, opening, and power feedback). The main error in each simulation is also discussed in detail. As a result, the model application is proved trustworthy for simulating different physical quantities of the unit (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>guide</b> vane opening, active power, rotation speed, and pressures at volute and draft tube). The model has already been applied effectively in consultant analyses and scientific studies. Correction in: Energies 9 (6) Article number: 477 DOI: 10. 3390 /en 9060477 </p...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{metallic}} wires with an adherent hydrophilic/ lubricious polymeric coating were {{manufactured in}} a new extrusion-like procedure. This procedure {{is part of a}} novel and efficient way of assembling lubricious guide wires for intravascular interventions, such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. It is reported that heparin can readily be incorporated in the hydrophilic coating. A set of heparin-containing guidewire models was made and studied in detail. This showed that (i) immersion of the guide-wire models in an aqueous environment leads to release of heparin from their surface; (ii) the presence of heparin in the coating does not impede the lubricity of the coils; (iii) addition of stearic acid in the coating, next to heparin, does not influence the lubricity of the guide-wire models. Two different charges of heparin (designated heparin-low and heparin-high) were incorporated in the coating. It is discussed that release of heparin from the surface of medical devices (e. <b>g.</b> <b>guide</b> wires and catheters) is much more effective than systemic heparinization, basically because dissolved heparin molecules have a much larger probability of simply passing a medical device's surface (axial convection) rather than contacting it (radial diffusion) ...|$|E
40|$|The introduction, {{analysis}} or {{development of}} soldier systems presents many {{questions regarding the}} optimum of possible combinations of burden, effectiveness and safety of the soldier system. The soldier is subject to {{a broad spectrum of}} physical loads {{as a consequence of the}} threats being encountered. Often, the individual burdens are treated and analysed independently, but the interdependence of the burdens require an integrated approach. In the future such a model can be used to e. <b>g.</b> <b>guide</b> decisions for procurement of clothing and equipment or to guide future needs for development. The initial steps in constructing such an integral model are presented here. The model is called COBESE (COst BEnefit model for Soldier system Evaluation). The focus for the current iteration COBESE model lies on the trade-off between mobility and vulnerability (i. e. the physical safety). COBESE aims to integrate existing models with expert judgement in order to model the influence of clothing and equipment (costs) on an individual soldier’s mobility (benefits). This integration qualitative and quantitative data is achieved using a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) approach. This paper describes the choices, underlying structure and the implemented sub-models of the COBESE model. Furthermore, case studies are performed to demonstrate the functionality and benefits of the model...|$|E

40|$|Many {{proposed}} {{formation flying}} missions seek {{to advance the}} state of the art in spacecraft science imaging by utilizing precision dual spacecraft formation flying to enable a virtual space telescope. Using precision dual spacecraft alignment, very long focal lengths can be achieved by locating the optics on one spacecraft and the detector on the other. Proposed science missions include astrophysics concepts with spacecraft separations from 1000 km to 25, 000 km, such as the Milli-Arc-Second Structure Imager (MASSIM) and the New Worlds Observer, and Heliophysics concepts for solar coronagraphs and X-ray imaging with smaller separations (50 m 500 m). All of these proposed missions require advances in guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) for precision formation flying. In particular, very precise astrometric alignment control and estimation is required for precise inertial pointing of the virtual space telescope to enable science imaging orders of magnitude better than can be achieved with conventional single spacecraft instruments. This work develops design architectures, algorithms, and performance analysis of proposed GNC systems for precision dual spacecraft astrometric alignment. These systems employ a variety of GNC sensors and actuators, including laser-based alignment and ranging systems, optical imaging sensors (e. <b>g.</b> <b>guide</b> star telescope), inertial measurement units (IMU), as well as micro-thruster and precision stabilized platforms. A comprehensive GNC performance analysis is given for Heliophysics dual spacecraft PFF imaging mission concept...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a study on freight {{transport}} analysis models. The purpose is to identify different stakeholders’ perceptions of existing models, e. g., strengths and weaknesses, and of their requirements and views on future models. The study is based on a questionnaire and interviews with representatives of public authorities, consultancy companies, and universities in Sweden and Denmark. The study shows that there is a need for freight analysis models for supporting the transport planning in public authorities, including impact assessment of actions and estimation of freight flows. The respondents work mainly with macro-level models, whose main strength is their large geographic scopes, which allow comparative studies on, e. g., the national level using one model. Weaknesses include poor quality, missing functionality, and inadequate user-friendliness. In order to achieve improved freight transport analysis, the respondents wish to include more detailed logistics aspects in their analyses, which could possibly be achieved by combining macro-level and agent-based models. The outcome of our study might be used by researchers and public authorities in order to, e. <b>g.,</b> <b>guide</b> the decision-making on future model development: the views of the model users and clients are important to consider in order to assure that the development and research efforts lead to fulfilling their needs.

40|$|International audienceThe {{real time}} {{recovery}} of the projection geometry is a fundamental issue in interventionnal navigation applications (e. <b>g.</b> <b>guide</b> wire reconstruction, medical augmented reality). In most works, the intrinsic parameters {{are supposed to be}} constant and the extrinsic parameters (C-arm motion) are deduced either from the orientation sensors of the C-arm or from additional sensors. However, due to the weight of the X-ray tube and the C-arm, the system is undergoing deformations which induces variations of the intrinsic parameters {{as a function of the}} C-arm orientations. In our approach, we proposed to measure the effects of the mechanical deformations onto the intrinsic parameters in a calibration procedure. Robust calibration methods exist (the gold standard is the the multi-image calibration) but they are time consuming and too tedious to set up in a clinicalcontext. For these reasons, we developed an original and easy to use method, based on a planar calibration target, which aims at measuring with a high level of accuracy the variation of the intrinsic parameters on a vascular C-arm. The precision of the planar based method was evaluated with error propagation method and its appeared that the precision of intrinsic parameters are very good compared to the gold standard method. The method was also successfully used to assess to behavior of the C-arm with respect to the C-arm orientations. Results showed a clear variation of the principal point when the LAO/RAO orientation was changed. In contrast, the intrinsic parameters do not change during a cranio-caudal C-arm motion...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is to identify characteristics of viewpoints having the views of collective tourism resources in seaside hot spring areas. The main findings are as follows. 1) For identifying collective tourism resources, landscape pictures which appeared in tourism informational materials (e. <b>g.</b> <b>guide</b> book, picture postcard and hotel’s booklet etc) in Obama hot spring areas, Nagasaki Prefecture are used as data. Based on landscape elements in landscape pictures, the list of tourism resources is developed. Landscape elements which are identified tourism resources including the list in each landscape picture is counted. Using these figures, appearance frequency of each tourism resource in total landscape pictures is calculated. Tourism resources which emerge at a high frequency are identified as collective tourism resources. Consequently, 5 tourism resources (‘Sea’, ’Low-mountain area’, ’Hotel’,’Sunset’ and ‘Points giving off steam’) are identified as collective tourism resources. 2) To classify viewpoints, panoramic photographs are taken at the points (128 points) which is set up in whole case study area. The ratio of total pixels of 5 collective tourism resources and the others in panoramic photograph is measured. Viewpoints are classified into 6 types by non hierarchical clustering using aforementioned parameters. 3) To identify location environments of viewpoints having the views of collective tourism resources, the relationship between geographical distribution of 6 type viewpoints and the periods of landfill is examined. Case study area is classified into 3 categories on {{the basis for the}} periods of landfill. These 2 parameters are cross-tabulated. As a result, the newest landfill areas include many viewpoints where the views containing high portion of collective tourism resources have. Based on these findings, we propose a list of considerations for reviewing the management to develop viewpoints where the views of collective tourism resources have in seaside hot spring areas...|$|E

In order to achieve improved freight transport analysis, the respondents wish to include more detailed logistics aspects in their analyses, which could possibly be achieved by combining macro-level and agent-based models. Research limitations/implications The limitation of this study is that we only included Danish and Swedish respondents, who mainly work with macro-level models. Moreover, only one Danish person answered the questionnaire. However, the respondent group represent a wide knowledge on freight and passenger transport models, and the study concerns to a large extent model types, not only particular models. Therefore, we argue that our findings have a wider geographic applicability.

40|$|Haptic {{bilateral}} teleoperation {{is often}} a challenging and mentally demanding job for the operators of robot control systems. It is especially difficult in cases such as the remote maintenance of the ITER divertor region. The difficulty of the ITER divertor maintenance hails from a multitude of reasons: the residual radiation level of the ITER reactor during a shutdown is too high for any human access, the maintenance tunnels of the divertor are confined, the operators have to operate heavy loads in delicate tasks, and {{only a limited number}} of radiation tolerant cameras are available for providing video feedback. In addition, most of the maintenance work cannot be automated because of the dynamic nature and complexity of the tasks. Haptic shared control systems can be used for reducing the amount of mental and physical workload perceived by the operators of remote maintenance systems. To reduce the workload, a haptic shared control system assists the operators by generating virtual forces based on the virtual models of the teleoperation environment and sensor data from the slave manipulator. The generated assistance forces are laid over the force feedback signals from the teleoperation environment. The assisting forces can e. <b>g.</b> <b>guide</b> the operators along optimal paths and prevent collisions in the teleoperation environment. In addition to the reduction of the operator workload, teleoperation tasks also become faster and safer with haptic shared control. This thesis investigates the implementation techniques and theory of haptic bilateral teleoperation and shared control systems. Based on the theoretical analysis, an experimental haptic shared control system, called the Computer Assisted Teleoperation (CAT) was developed. The intention of CAT is to assist the remote handling (RH) system operators of the Divertor Test Platform 2 (DTP 2) in ITER remote maintenance research. The effectiveness of CAT is evaluated in a teleoperation experiment performed with a 6 DOF Water Hydraulic MANipulator (WHMAN) developed for the ITER divertor maintenance. The results of the experiment gives directive indication that the CAT system improves the execution times of a bilateral teleoperation task and simultaneously reduces the workload perceived by the operators of the system...|$|E

40|$|Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: A Practical Guide for Tuberculosis Programs Providing Services to Karen Persons from Burma {{is part of}} {{a series}} that aims to help {{tuberculosis}} (TB) program staff provide culturally competent TB care to some of our highest priority foreign-born populations. Other Guides in the series focus on persons from China, Laos, Mexico, Somalia, and Vietnam (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010). [URL] This Guide is intended for health care providers, community-based workers, program planners, administrators, health educators, and resettlement agencies that work with Karen (pronouncedka-RENN) communities. This Guide is designed to increase the knowledge and cultural sensitivityof health care providers, program planners, and any others serving Karen persons from Burma. The ultimate aim is to foster provision of culturally competent TB care and services for Karen people in the United States (U. S.). Some of the information in the Guides, such as the practical tips, can be directly applied; while other sections are more informative and will help providers better understand the background and socio-cultural context of the population. It is hoped that a deeper understanding of pertinent issues will heighten the cultural sensitivity of TB care providers, enhance communication, and improve the overall effectiveness of organizations and staff in cross-cultural settings. The content of these Guides was gathered in two ways. First, an in-depth review of TB-related epidemiologic, behavioral, and ethnographic literature on Karen Burmese in the U. S. was performed. Secondly, in 2007, the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (DTBE) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) undertook a qualitative study to describe ethnographic aspects of the increasing burden of TB among Karen persons from Burma residing in two U. S. cities. Findings from this original research are also included in this Guide. This mirrored the 2003 CDC study that explored five cultural groups (see [URL] for copies of these Ethnographic Guides).
