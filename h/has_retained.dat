5|$|American Pharoah officially began {{breeding}} mares in February 2016, and {{was first}} bred to Untouched Talent, an 11-year-old mare owned by Coolmore, dam of Zayat's Bodemeister. Within {{the first two}} months of his breeding career, American Pharoah had about 80 mares in foal after approximately 100 breeding sessions. Notably, he <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> his kind disposition even as a breeding stallion.|$|E
5|$|Dating {{from the}} 7th century to 1522, Ripon Cathedral {{preserves}} the crypt {{of the original}} church built by Saint Wilfred. The west front is an unaltered and harmonious composition in Early English Gothic.

5|$|Earth <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> all of {{the noble}} gases that were present at its {{formation}} except helium. Krypton's concentration in the atmosphere is about 1 ppm. It can be extracted from liquid air by fractional distillation. The amount of krypton in space is uncertain, because measurement is derived from meteoric activity and solar winds. The first measurements suggest an abundance of krypton in space.|$|E

The route was originally designated in late 1955.|$|E

Even though larger denominations being withdrawn around the world, the MAS <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> the use of the $10,000 denomination. MAS discontinued issuing new $10,000 banknotes from 1 October 2014 as authorities suspect these notes are meant for illegal purposes.|$|E

5|$|Built between 1117 and 1508, Peterborough Cathedral is {{remarkable}} as the least altered of the Norman cathedrals with only its famous Early English west front, with its later porch and the Perpendicular rebuilding {{of the eastern}} ambulatory by John Wastell being in different styles. J.L. Cartwright wrote of the west front that it is “as magnificent an entrance to a sacred building as could well be imagined.” The long wooden roof of the nave is original and <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> its painting from 1220.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1175 and 1490, Wells Cathedral {{has been}} {{described}} as “the most poetic of the English Cathedrals”. Much of the structure is in the Early English style and is greatly enriched by the deeply sculptural nature of the mouldings and the vitality of the carved capitals in a foliate style known as “stiff leaf”. The eastern end <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> much original glass, which is rare in England. The exterior has the finest Early English façade and a large central tower.|$|E
5|$|During the American {{retreat from}} Quebec, {{and in this}} battle, wounded {{soldiers}} were treated at the Ursuline convent in Trois-Rivières. Congress never authorized payment for these services and the convent <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> the bill. By the early 21st century, the original bill of about £26 {{was estimated to be}} equivalent to between ten and twenty million Canadian dollars, if compound interest was applied. On July 4, 2009, during festivities marking the town's 375th anniversary, American Consul-General David Fetter symbolically repaid the debt to the Ursulines with a payment of C$130.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, MDOT {{petitioned the}} American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to {{decommission}} the US27 designation in the state; {{the change was}} approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change. After the change was implemented, Bus. US27 was renumbered to Bus. US127 as {{with all of the}} other similar business routes in the state. However, unlike the other new Bus. US127s, this one had no connection to US127, its new parent highway. MDOT <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> the business route as an unsigned trunkline designation ever since.|$|E
5|$|In ancient times, Pugs were bred to be companions for ruling {{families}} in China. The pet Pugs were highly valued by Chinese Emperors, and the royal dogs {{were kept in}} luxury and guarded by soldiers. Pugs later spread {{to other parts of}} Asia. In Tibet, Buddhist monks kept Pugs as pets in their monasteries. The breed <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> its affectionate devotion to its owners since ancient times.|$|E
5|$|It {{originally}} {{started as}} a massive loop around the Chicago area, however it <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> its current, much shorter route ever since 1937. During the 1990s, it {{became the subject of}} much concern for local residents regarding expansion which slowed down any progress for capacity improvement. By the late 2000s, the delays have come and gone and it has emerged as a state route that has been largely modernized to deal with heavy traffic.|$|E

5|$|P. l. maculatus, {{known as}} the Marozi or spotted lion, {{sometimes}} {{is believed to be}} a distinct subspecies, but may be an adult lion that <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> its juvenile spotted pattern. If it was a subspecies in its own right, rather than a small number of aberrantly coloured individuals, it has been extinct since 1931. A less likely identity is a natural leopard-lion hybrid commonly known as a leopon.|$|E

The portion from I-25 to SH83/ Parker Road was rebuilt {{as part of}} the T-REX Project completed in 2006. The highway was later widened between Parker Road and Mississippi Avenue to three lanes, as part of a project to widen the entire freeway to I-70; construction on this portion took place between May 2012 and November 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{ending of}} Redemption varies {{depending}} upon on {{the quantity of}} humanity Christof <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> during the game. If the quantity is great, Christof reconciles with Anezka and turns her into a vampire, sparing her from death. If his humanity is moderate, he surrenders to Vukodlak and becomes a ghoul; Vukodlak betrays Christof and forces him to murder Anezka. A lesser quantity of humanity results in Christof killing Vukodlak by drinking his blood. Greatly empowered, Christof forsakes his humanity, murders Anezka, and revels in his new power.|$|E

5|$|The {{house was}} built over the old cloisters and the main rooms are on the first floor. It is a stone house with stone slated roofs, twisted chimney stacks and mullioned windows. Throughout {{the life of the}} building, many {{architectural}} alterations, additions, and renovations have occurred so that the house is a mish-mash of different periods and styles. The Tudor stable courtyard {{to the north of the}} house <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> many of its original features including the old brewhouse and bakehouse.|$|E
5|$|The modern Saluki <b>has</b> <b>retained</b> {{qualities of}} hunting hounds and may seem {{reserved}} to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed {{may be difficult}} to train. Training methods should always be gentle and patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|E
