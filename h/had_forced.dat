5|$|By July 1918, it {{was clear}} that the German Spring Offensive on the Western Front, which <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> the {{postponement}} of offensive plans in Palestine, had failed, resulting in a return to trench warfare on the Western Front. This coincided with the approach of the campaigning season in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Although Charles II's anti-French Parliament <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> England to {{withdraw}} from the Franco-Dutch War in 1674, some English regiments remained in French service. In April Churchill was appointed the colonelcy of one such regiment, thereafter serving with, and learning from, the great Marshal Turenne. Churchill was present at the hard-fought battles of Sinsheim in June 1674, and Enzheim in October; he may also have been present at Sasbach in July 1675, where Turenne was killed.|$|E
5|$|At a {{press conference}} {{arranged}} by Cuban authorities on 30 July, Modig and Carromero stated that the crash was an accident and no other car was involved. Speaking in 2013 to the Washington Post, Carromero denied this version of events, stating {{that he had been}} drugged and threatened by Cuban authorities who <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> him to make a false statement. He stated instead that the car had been rammed by another vehicle with Cuban government license plates, causing the fatal crash.|$|E

5|$|Before this discovery, in September 1987, African-American {{rights groups}} <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> tunnel {{contractor}} Atkinson/Dillingham to return 36 steel beams from South Africa used for temporary shoring at Pioneer Square station.

5|$|During {{the first}} 36 hours of battle, from 04:30 on 19 September until 17:00 on 20 September, the German and Ottoman front line {{had been cut}} by infantry, and the cavalry had passed through the gap to reach their {{objectives}} at Afulah, Nazareth, and Beisan. The continuing British Empire infantry attack in the Judean Hills <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies to withdraw northwards towards the waiting Desert Mounted Corps.|$|E
5|$|In its engagements {{during the}} Perimeter battle, the KPA 13th Division, with 9,500 men, <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> South Korean troops into the Tabu-dong {{corridor}} and started advancing on Taegu. This division had battled the ROK 11th and 12th Regiments in the Yuhak-san {{area for a}} week before it broke through to the corridor on August 17. A regimental commander of the division said later it suffered 1,500 casualties in the process. On August 18, the 13th Division was concentrated mostly west of the road just north of Tabu-dong.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 June, two Argentine Dagger {{aircraft}} attacked Cardiffs Lynx helicopter, no.335 of 829NAS, while it was searching in the Falkland Sound area. Poor weather <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> the Argentine craft to abandon their original mission of bombing Mount Longdon, and the third Dagger of their formation had suffered a mechanical failure and returned to base. The Lynx began evasive manoeuvres and dodged the attacks; the pilot, Lieutenant Christopher Clayton, was mentioned in despatches for his efforts.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund {{took the}} {{customary}} oath of the Transylvanian monarchs on 23December 1588. Pope Sixtus V excommunicated {{him for the}} expulsion of the Jesuits. Sigismund's cousin, Cardinal Andrew Báthory, urged the pope to lift the ban, saying that the prince's Protestant advisors <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> him {{to throw out the}} friars. The pope authorized Sigismund to employ a confessor in May 1589, and the excommunication was revoked on Easter 1590.|$|E

5|$|The German army's rapid {{manoeuvres}} {{during the}} invasion <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> the tactical withdrawal of Yugoslav forces facing Hungarian army units {{and there was}} no significant fighting between the two armies. The Hungarian forces advanced south to the Danube between Vukovar and the confluence with the Tisza without any real military resistance. Serb Chetnik irregulars fought isolated engagements, and the Hungarian General Staff considered irregular resistance forces to be their only significant opposition.|$|E
5|$|The {{tourists}} travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval, {{and they}} amassed 632 after batting first. Johnston bowled without {{success in the}} first innings. In the second innings he claimed both openers to reduce the hosts to 2/11 after Bradman <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> them to follow on. He returned later in the innings to remove Alec Bedser and Jim Laker, ending with 4/40 as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Johnston was rested for the following match against Cambridge University, which Australia won by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Under Guangwu's {{rule the}} Han Empire was restored. Guangwu made Luoyang his capital in 25 AD, and by 27 AD his {{officers}} Deng Yu and Feng Yi <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> the Red Eyebrows to surrender and executed their leaders for treason. From 26 until 36 AD, Emperor Guangwu had {{to wage war}} against other regional warlords who claimed the title of emperor; when these warlords were defeated, China reunified under the Han.|$|E

5|$|Vietnamization was {{catching}} up with the conflict in Laos. During the 1970–1971 dry season, U.S. Air Force strike missions in support of Hmong operations had dropped by 70 percent {{from the previous year}} from 114 sorties per day to 38. The grinding nature of the conflict was also having a cumulative effect on the adult male population of the Hmong. Severe attrition <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> the Hmong into a numbers game that they could not win.|$|E
5|$|Acid2 {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Håkon Wium Lie, {{chief technical officer}} of Opera Software and creator of the widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard. In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E
5|$|Adamle's {{decision}} {{to drop out}} was controversial because of rules that under normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating. The interruption of the war <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> the suspension of the rule to account for players' military service, however, and {{he was allowed to}} leave college. The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E

5|$|Always {{in need of}} funds, Raynald urged Manuel to {{send the}} promised subsidy to him, but Manuel failed to pay the money. Raynald made an {{alliance}} with Thoros II of Cilicia. They attacked Cyprus, subjecting the Byzantine island to a three-week orgy of violence in early 1156. They only left Cyprus on the rumour of an imperial fleet approaching the island, but only after they <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> all Cypriots to ransom themselves, {{with the exception of}} the wealthiest individuals (including Emperor Manuel's nephew, John Doukas Komnenos), whom they carried off to Antioch. Cyprus would never entirely recover from the devastation that Raynald's and Thoros's marauding raid caused.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Tarrare {{had a huge}} {{appetite}} and by his teens could eat {{a quarter of a}} bullock, weighing as much as Tarrare himself, in a single day. By this time, his parents could not provide for him and <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> him to leave home. For some years after this, he toured the country with a roaming band of thieves and prostitutes, begging and stealing for food, before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling charlatan. Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other. He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of snake meat.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, Japanese expansionary {{moves in}} the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) had ceased. Their advance in Papua New Guinea had been halted the {{previous}} year by the blocking action that Australian forces had fought along the Kokoda Track. Subsequent defeats at Milne Bay, Buna–Gona, Wau and on Guadalcanal <b>had</b> <b>forced</b> the Japanese on to the back foot. As {{a result of these}} victories, the Allies were able to seize the initiative in the region in mid-1943 and began making plans to continue to push the Japanese back in New Guinea.|$|E
