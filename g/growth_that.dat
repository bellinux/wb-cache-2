5|$|Around {{the time}} the highway was completed, the federal {{government}} began to promote suburbanization by moving several federal agencies out of the capital {{in order to protect}} them against nuclear attack. As a result, suburban neighborhoods began to appear in Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and Greenbelt. In addition, the road became a prime commuting route into both Washington and Baltimore, leading to suburban <b>growth</b> <b>that</b> would eventually cause the two distinct cities to merge into one large metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|Demand for {{electricity}} grows with great rapidity {{as a nation}} modernises and its economy develops. The United States showed a 12% increase in demand during each year {{of the first three}} decades of the twentieth century, a rate of <b>growth</b> <b>that</b> is now being experienced by emerging economies such as those of India or China. Historically, the growth rate {{for electricity}} demand has outstripped that for other forms of energy.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, Coquitlam and {{the rest}} of the Lower Mainland {{experienced}} substantial population <b>growth</b> <b>that</b> continues today. The opening of Lougheed Highway in 1953 made the city more accessible and set the stage for residential growth. In 1971, Coquitlam and Fraser Mills were amalgamated, which gave the city a larger industrial base. The mill closed in 2001, and is now rezoned into a residential area.|$|E

They form more stable territories elsewhere, such as in coastal areas. Cooperative breeding is less common with this species than with other fairywrens; helper birds have been sporadically reported, but the red-backed fairywren has been little studied.|$|E
5|$|Physical damage {{can also}} reduce the value of carrot crops. The two main forms of damage are splitting, whereby a {{longitudinal}} crack develops during <b>growth</b> <b>that</b> can be a few centimetres to {{the entire length of}} the root, and breaking, which occurs postharvest. These disorders can affect over 30% of commercial crops. Factors associated with high levels of splitting include wide plant spacing, early sowing, lengthy growth durations, and genotype.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographic}} <b>growth</b> <b>that</b> {{occurred in}} Sélestat after 1945 was {{primarily due to}} a relatively high birth rate (20.1‰ in Sélestat over the period 1968–1975, compared to 16.9‰ in France). After 1975, this rate progressively declined to match the national figure. Net migration figures remained slightly negative until 1990 because Sélestat and Central Alsace were {{on the margins of}} the metropolitan areas of Strasbourg and Colmar and lacked attractivity. Since 1990, the Strasbourg area greatly expanded to gradually reach Sélestat. The town has thus become more attractive to newcomers.|$|E

5|$|As they {{sail for}} Greenland, strange things begin {{to happen to}} the ships bearing the {{tourmaline}} veils. Marine life and sea birds of all kinds are attracted towards them, and crew stationed aboard them for too long begin acting intoxicated and amorous. The plant and animal life attracted to the ships experiences rapid growth, so that before they reach Greenland the ships look more like mountains or meadows than ships. Strange sea creatures never before seen appear around the ships, and when the expedition is ready to deploy the tourmaline veils, they have to cut through the riot of organic <b>growth</b> <b>that</b> has totally filled the ships. Once the energy of the veils is unleashed on Greenland, it melts the ice quickly but also has unanticipated effects. Prehistoric bones and plant remains that were buried under the ice are reanimated, and fuse together into monstrous forms made up of plant, animal, and mineral parts. Greenland, free of its icy burden, rises up, ripping from north to south in the process and becoming two separate islands. As the chapter ends, the now enormous monsters brought to life by the volcanic energy are spilling away from Greenland towards Europe.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{structure}} of the SYNOP code, a maximum of three cloud symbols can be plotted for each reporting station that appears on the weather map. All cloud types are coded and transmitted by trained observers then plotted on maps as low, middle, or high-étage using special symbols for each major cloud type. Any cloud type with significant vertical extent that can occupy more than one étage is coded as low (cumulus and cumulonimbus) or middle (nimbostratus) depending on the altitude level or étage where it normally initially forms aside from any vertical <b>growth</b> <b>that</b> takes place. The symbol used on the map for each of these étages at a particular observation time is for the genus, species, variety, mutation, or cloud motion that is considered most important according to criteria set out by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). If these elements for any étage at the time of observation are deemed to be of equal importance, then the type which is predominant in amount is coded by the observer and plotted on the weather map using the appropriate symbol. Special weather maps in aviation show areas of icing and turbulence.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} rapid {{industrial}} <b>growth</b> <b>that</b> began in Indiana during the gas boom of the late 19th-century, labor unions began to form with goals of increasing wages and providing other benefits to workers through collective bargaining. The Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company was founded to own and operate the streetcar terminal in downtown Indianapolis, and operate the Indianapolis Street Railway under a lease agreement for a term of 31 years. In 1892 the employees of Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company launched a short-lived strike. The company was the primary public transportation provider in Indianapolis and operated the central transportation hub {{for the city of}} Indianapolis and state of Indiana. The company offered small concessions, and the workers returned to work without unionizing.|$|E
5|$|Fruit body {{primordia}} first appear {{between the}} scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from the stem tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal <b>growth</b> (<b>that</b> is, growth outward from the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48–72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances {{on the part of}} the stem adjoining the undersurface of the cap. As the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.|$|E
5|$|Telopea oreades needs a well-drained {{location}} as well {{as reliable}} moisture to thrive. Soil with some clay content is beneficial. It is more shade-tolerant than the more popular New South Wales waratah, preferring part-shade but tolerating sunny aspects. It tolerates moderate frosts. Plants can be hard-pruned—lopping old stems and branches can rejuvenate mature plants. Plants can benefit from low-phosphorus fertilizer applied in spring and autumn. Propagation is by seed, the germination rates of which fall significantly after several months' storage unless refrigerated, or by cuttings of new <b>growth</b> <b>that</b> has just hardened. Cultivars must be propagated by cutting to make daughter plants identical to the parent.|$|E

5|$|The large groove {{that runs}} {{the length of the}} spine was once thought to be a channel for blood vessels, but since the bone does not contain {{vascular}} canals, the sail is not thought to have been as highly vascularized as once thought. Some specimens of Dimetrodon preserve deformed areas of the neural spines that appear to be healed-over fractures. The cortical bone that grew over these breaks is highly vascularized, suggesting that soft tissue must have been present on the sail to supply the site with blood vessels. Layered lamellar bone makes up most of the neural spine's cross-sectional area, and contains lines of arrested <b>growth</b> <b>that</b> can be used to determine the age of each individual at death. In many specimens of D. gigashomogenes the distal portions of spines bend sharply, indicating that the sail would have had an irregular profile in life. Their crookedness suggests that soft tissue may not have extended {{all the way to the}} tips of the spines, meaning that the sail's webbing may not have been as extensive as it is commonly imagined.|$|E
5|$|The state {{suffered}} from financial difficulties {{during its first}} three decades. Jonathan Jennings attempted to begin a period of internal improvements. Among his projects, the Indiana Canal Company was reestablished to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio. The Panic of 1819 caused the state's only two banks to fold. This hurt Indiana's credit, halted the projects, and hampered the start of new projects until the 1830s, after the repair of the state's finances during the terms of William Hendricks and Noah Noble. Beginning in 1831, large scale plans for statewide improvements were set into motion. Overspending on the internal improvements led to a large deficit {{that had to be}} funded by state bonds through the newly created Bank of Indiana and sale of over nine million acres (36,000km²) of public land. By 1841 the debt had become unmanageable. Having borrowed over $13million, the equivalent to the state's first fifteen years of tax revenue, the government could not even pay interest on the debt. The state narrowly avoided bankruptcy by negotiating the liquidation of the public works, transferring them to the state's creditors in exchange for a 50% reduction in the state's debt. The internal improvements began under Jennings paid off as the state began to experience rapid population <b>growth</b> <b>that</b> slowly remedied the state's funding problems. The improvements led to a fourfold increase in land value, and an even larger increase in farm produce.|$|E
