Correlation of Azam showed that <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis; <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking observed highly significant while <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with anthesis to silking interval (ASI) observed significant difference. Correlations of Pahari showed that <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis; <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking; grain yield with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity observed highly significant but grain yield with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking observed significant difference. Correlation analysis of Iqbal showed that <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis; <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking showed highly significant while anthesis to silking interval (ASI) with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with anthesis to silking interval (ASI) observed significant difference.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{uncertainty}} about which end points {{should be used}} for Phase II trials in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate potential end points for Phase II trials in critically ill patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: A report outlining a process of literature review and recommendations from a consensus meeting conducted on behalf of the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Clinical Trials Group (ANZICS CTG) in October 2011.

5|$|Despite the {{proclamation}} of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial {{institutions like the}} Force Publique to function from <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day,</b> and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.|$|E

With Shaw's retirement in 1969, the laboratory was rededicated to urban and medical entomology research, with the former beekeeping program falling into relative obscurity.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{demonstrates}} bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, {{which are}} transient and only occur {{at times of}} heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day.</b> They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (less than 1000km in width) circular features located at approximately 16Â° from the magnetic poles; the satellites' auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter's ionosphere with those of its largest moons, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals. Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost {{all parts of the}} electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3keV), they are brightest in the mid-infrared (wavelength 3â4Î¼m and 7â14Î¼m) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions (wavelength 80â180nm).|$|E
5|$|The area {{generally}} has warm summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary from <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day</b> {{as well as}} from season to season. Its latitude means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing unsettled and windy weather particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fine weather. In winter anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought. The two dominant influences on the climate of the Whitby area are shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the North York Moors and the proximity of the North Sea. Late, chilly springs and warm summers are a feature of the area but there are often spells of fine autumn weather. Onshore winds in spring and early summer bring mists or low stratus clouds (known locally as sea frets) to the coast and moors.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day,</b> which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonicâclonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day.</b> In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E
5|$|The East Riding {{generally}} has cool summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary from <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>day</b> {{as well as}} from season to season. The latitude of the area means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing with them unsettled and windy weather, particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fair weather. In winter, anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought, particularly on the Wolds. For its latitude this area is mild in winter and cooler in summer due to the influence of the Gulf Stream in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Air temperature varies on a daily and seasonal basis. The temperature is usually lower at night, and January is the coldest time of the year. The two dominant influences on the climate of the area are the shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the Pennines and the proximity of the North Sea.|$|E
