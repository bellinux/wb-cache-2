25|$|In 1890, the {{two cities}} were {{connected}} with a railway along University Avenue, {{the first of four}} rail lines linking them together. A merger of the two city systems, the St. Paul City Railway Co. and Minneapolis Street Railway, formed the Twin City Rapid Transit Company. It went on a building spree, quickly doubling the amount of <b>electrified</b> <b>track</b> in the system.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of the first model electric vehicle is attributed to various people. In 1828, Ányos Jedlik, a Hungarian who invented an early type of electric motor, created a small model car powered by his new motor. In 1834, Vermont blacksmith Thomas Davenport built a similar contraption which operated on a short, circular, <b>electrified</b> <b>track.</b> In 1834, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of Groningen, the Netherlands and his assistant Christopher Becker created a small-scale electrical car, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells.|$|E

25|$|Two more {{electrification}} {{projects were}} undertaken under state ownership. Third rail electrification was extended on the Main Line and Port Jefferson Branch from Mineola to Hicksville and Huntington on October 19, 1970, after being started in 1968. This {{was the first}} time in 43 years that electrified service was extended to previously non-third rail territory. The Main Line beyond Hicksville (where the Port Jefferson Branch splits) to Ronkonkoma (also known as the Ronkonkoma Branch) was fully electrified in December 1987, however, in 1987 there was interim electric service to Farmingdale. The improvement extended electrified service a full 50 miles east of Manhattan to Suffolk County's central corridor communities of Wyandanch, Deer Park, Brentwood, Central Islip, and Ronkonkoma. New electric service was also added to two station in Nassau County; Bethpage and Farmingdale. Peak period running times between Ronkonkoma and Penn Station were reduced to 60 minutes from 93 minutes. This time savings led to an increase in ridership on the Ronkonkoma Branch. In 2007, ridership on the branch had increased from 6,200 to 16,000 passenger trips every day, equaling a 150 percent increase. The Ronkonkoma Branch then became the second largest branch in total ridership after the Babylon Branch. In 1985, a second <b>electrified</b> <b>track</b> was built between Syosset and Huntington on the Port Jefferson Branch in order to eliminate a single track bottleneck. This helped boost ridership pn the branch. Further extensions of electrification (to stations such as Port Jefferson, Yaphank, Patchogue or Speonk) have been seriously considered from time to time, but no such short-term capital budget actions are currently contemplated.|$|E
500|$|The UERL used a Westinghouse {{automatic}} signalling system operated through <b>electrified</b> <b>track</b> circuits. This controlled signals {{based on the}} presence or absence of a train on the track ahead. Signals incorporated an arm that was raised when the signal was red. If a train failed to stop at a red signal, the arm would activate a [...] "tripcock" [...] on the train; applying the brakes automatically.|$|E
2500|$|Gulfoss Tunnel is a [...] {{railway tunnel}} {{situated}} at Gulfossen in Melhus, Norway. The tunnel carries a single, <b>electrified</b> <b>track</b> of the Dovre Line. The Trondhjem–Støren Line, {{which opened in}} 1864, crossed the river Gaula on a bridge {{to the opposite side}} of the river as the current site of the tunnel. This section of track was a challenge due to regular flooding. With the 1908 decision to build the Dovre Line and gauge conversion, the Gulfossen section became one of two parts of the line to be reworked. Gulfoss Tunnel opened on 6 July 1918.|$|E

2500|$|The Smørstein Tunnel is a [...] {{railway tunnel}} located at Smøstein in [...] Holmestrand, Norway. The tunnel carried a single, <b>electrified</b> <b>track</b> of the Vestfold Line. The {{need for a}} tunnel arose after a 19 August 1918 {{landslide}} washed away the railway past Smørstein. A temporary track was in place from 28 October, but the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) determined that the geology was too unstable and thus decided to build a tunnel to avoid the poor geological conditions. The tunnel opened on 25 May 1921 and was until 2010 the only tunnel on the Vestfold Line between Drammen and Larvik.
