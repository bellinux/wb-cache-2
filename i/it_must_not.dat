It is very likely that before his accession he had lived for several years at the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, for he is recorded {{to have been a}} silentiarius, an influential position at the imperial palace; alternatively, but less probably, he may have been given the title as an honorary appointment after his accession.|$|E
5|$|The Hugo Award for Best Fancast {{is awarded}} to the best non-professional audio or video {{periodical}} devoted to science fiction, fantasy, or related subjects. The fancast must have released four or more episodes {{by the end of}} the previous calendar year, at least one of which appeared in that year, and <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> qualify for the dramatic presentation category. It must also not provide or be published by an entity that provides a quarter or more of the income of any one person working on the fancast. The name of the award is a portmanteau of fan and podcast. The Hugo Award for Best Fancast was first proposed as a category after the 2011 awards, and then appeared as a temporary category at the 2012 awards. Temporary awards are not required to be repeated in following years. The 2013 awards, however, did repeat the category, and afterwards it was ratified as a permanent category, and will appear in all future years.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea {{was pushing}} for an {{additional}} station {{in the north of}} the borough, east of Old Oak Common, at Kensal off Ladbroke Grove and Canal Way. A turn-back facility, now built west of Paddington, could have been sited at Kensal to provide a frequent service to a new station to regenerate that area. Former Mayor Boris Johnson agreed that a station would be added if it met three tests: <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> delay construction of Crossrail, it did not compromise performance of Crossrail or any other railway, and <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> increase Crossrail's overall cost. So the council agreed to underwrite the projected £33million cost, and a consultancy study that then concluded a Kensal station would not compromise Crossrail.|$|E

However, if the flag is raised at an outdoor assembly, an official gathering, funeral or a memorial the flag may be flown as long as the event lasts, though never beyond midnight.|$|E

But the legislative powers remain distributed and if in the exercise of her new functions derived from her new international status she incurs obligations they must, so far as legislation be concerned when they deal with provincial classes of subjects, be dealt with by the totality of powers, in other words by co-operation between the Dominion and the Provinces. While the ship of state now sails on larger ventures and into foreign waters she still retains the watertight compartments which are an essential part of her original structure.|$|E

25|$|The Ten Minute Takeover - This feature {{began on}} the {{afternoon}} show, usually happening daily at about 15:00, {{and moved to the}} drivetime show happening straight after Newsbeat at 18:00, Monday to Thursday. Listeners contact the show requesting a song, of which three are chosen, one each from the text, Facebook and Twitter. The following criteria have to be met in order for it to be played: <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> have been played on the show already that day, and it must be in the Radio 1 computer system. This second rule has created much controversy over the years, because songs are regularly not in the system, leading Greg to criticize the 'music police', who delete songs they consider to be too old for the station. The feature is a parody of the former 'Ten Hour Takeover' request feature that used to happen on Bank Holidays.|$|E
25|$|A learner's permit can {{be issued}} at age 16. The student {{may choose to}} learn by going to a driving school or in private with up to four {{different}} instructors. Usually a mix of the two is used. These instructors must be 24 or older and must have held a valid driver's licence for five years (<b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> have been cancelled temporarily for drunk driving and other serious traffic violations, but a single speeding conviction is now acceptable). The instructors and student must go through a traffic safety course before permission is granted; it takes about three hours to complete and is usually given at all driving schools on certain dates. From 2010 it is enough for every student and every instructor to go on this course once; before that each instructor and student pair had to go together, e.g. father/elder child, mother/elder child, father/younger child, mother/younger child.|$|E
25|$|After the serve, {{the players}} take turns {{hitting the ball}} against the front wall, above the tin and below the out line. The ball may strike the side or back walls at any time, {{as long as it}} hits below the out line. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> hit the floor after hitting the racket and before hitting the front wall. A ball landing on either the out line or the line {{along the top of the}} tin is {{considered}} to be out. After the ball hits the front wall, it is allowed to bounce once on the floor (and any number of times against the side or back walls) before a player must return it. Players may move anywhere around the court but accidental or deliberate obstruction of the other player's movements is forbidden and could result in a let or a stroke. Players typically return to the centre of the court after making a shot.|$|E

25|$|The use of lead glaze {{has several}} {{advantages}} over alkali glazes {{in addition to}} their greater optical refractivity. Lead compounds in suspension may be added directly to the ceramic body. Alkali glazes must first be mixed with silica and fritted prior to use, since they are soluble in water, requiring additional labor. A successful glaze must not crawl, or peel away from the pottery surface upon cooling, leaving areas of unglazed ceramic. Lead reduces this risk by reducing the surface tension of the glaze. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> craze, forming a network of cracks, caused when the thermal contraction of the glaze and the ceramic body do not match properly. Ideally, the glaze contraction should be 5–15% less than the body contraction, as glazes are stronger under compression than under tension. A high-lead glaze has a linear expansion coefficient of between 5 and 7×10−6/°C, compared to 9 to 10×10−6/°C for alkali glazes. Those of earthenware ceramics vary between 3 and 5×10−6/°C for non-calcareous bodies and 5 to 7×10−6/°C for calcareous clays, or those containing 15–25% CaO. Therefore, the thermal contraction of lead glaze matches that of the ceramic more closely than an alkali glaze, rendering it less prone to crazing. A glaze should also have a low enough viscosity to prevent the formation of pinholes as trapped gasses escape during firing, typically between 900–1100°C, but not so low as to run off. The relatively low viscosity of lead glaze mitigates this issue. It may also have been cheaper to produce than alkali glazes.|$|E

500|$|Non-metastatic {{squamous}} cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma are very rare in the endometrium. Squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium has a poor prognosis. It has been reported fewer than 100times in the medical literature since its characterization in 1892. For primary {{squamous cell}} carcinoma of the endometrium (PSCCE) to be diagnosed, there must be no other primary cancer in the endometrium or cervix and <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> {{be connected to the}} cervical epithelium. Because of the rarity of this cancer, there are no guidelines for how it should be treated, nor any typical treatment. The common genetic causes remain uncharacterized. Primary transitional cell carcinomas of the endometrium are even more rare; 16cases had been reported [...] Its pathophysiology and treatments have not been characterized. Histologically, TCCE resembles endometrioid carcinoma and is distinct from other transitional cell carcinomas.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} The Man in the Moone was published, {{discussion}} on the plurality of worlds had begun to favour the possibility of extraterrestrial life. For Christian thinkers such a plurality is intimately connected to Christ and his redemption of man: if there are other worlds, do they share a similar history, and does Christ also redeem them in his sacrifice? According to Philipp Melanchthon, a 16th-century theologian who worked closely with Martin Luther, [...] "It must not be imagined {{that there are many}} worlds, because <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> be imagined that Christ died or was resurrected more often, nor must it be thought that in any other world without the knowledge of the son of God, that men would be restored to eternal life". Similar comments were made by Calvinist theologian Lambert Daneau. Midway through the 17th century the matter appears to have been settled in favour of a possible plurality, which was accepted by Henry More and Aphra Behn among others; [...] "by 1650, the Elizabethan Oxford examination question an sint plures mundi? ('can these be many worlds?'– to which the correct Aristotelian answer was 'no') had been replaced by the disputation thesis quod Luna sit habitabilis ('that the moon could be habitable'– which might be answered 'probably' if not 'yes')".|$|E
500|$|When {{the head}} of {{household}} finds a suitable tree, he {{stands in front of}} it facing east. After throwing grain at the tree, he greets it with the words [...] "Good morning and happy Christmas Eve to you", makes the Sign of the Cross, says a prayer, and kisses the tree. He may also explain to the badnjak why it will be cut: [...] "I have come to you to take to my home, to be my faithful helper to every progress and improvement, in the house, in the pen, in the field, and in every place." [...] He then cuts it slantwise on its eastern side, using an axe. Some men put gloves on before they start to cut the tree, and from then on never touch the badnjak with their bare hands. The tree should fall to the east, unhindered by surrounding trees. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> be left half-cut, as then it will curse the house of the man. In some regions, if the tree is not cut down after the third blow of the axe, then it must be pulled and twisted until its trunk breaks. The resulting badnjak has a so-called [...] "beard", the part of the trunk at which it broke off {{from the base of the}} tree. In Šumadija, half of a circular loaf of bread is left on the stump, the other half being eaten on the way back home. In Zagarač, the stump is covered with moss or dry leaves, and it will be visited again in spring: the stump sprouting through the cover is an omen of good luck and prosperity.|$|E
