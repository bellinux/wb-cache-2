5|$|Mixing about 2.0% {{beryllium}} into copper {{forms an}} alloy called beryllium copper that is six times stronger than copper alone. Beryllium alloys {{are used in}} many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, high strength and hardness, nonmagnetic properties, as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance. These applications include non-sparking tools that are used near <b>flammable</b> <b>gases</b> (beryllium nickel), in springs and membranes (beryllium nickel and beryllium iron) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices. As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid magnesium leads to {{a significant increase in}} oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability.|$|E

25|$|Percentage {{reading on}} {{combustible}} air monitors {{should not be}} confused with the LEL concentrations. Explosimeters designed and calibrated to a specific gas may show the relative concentration of the atmosphere to the LEL—the LEL being 100%. A 5% displayed LEL reading for methane, for example, would be equivalent to 5% multiplied by 5.0%, or approximately 0.25% methane by volume at 20 degrees C. Control of the explosion hazard is usually achieved by sufficient natural or mechanical ventilation, to limit the concentration of <b>flammable</b> <b>gases</b> or vapors to a maximum level of 25% of their lower explosive or flammable limit.|$|E
25|$|Cylinders {{should be}} stored in an area {{segregated}} from oxidizers to avoid exacerbated reaction in case of fire/leakage. Acetylene cylinders should not {{be stored in}} confined spaces / enclosed vehicles / garages / buildings to avoid unintended leakage leading to explosive atmosphere. In the USA, National Electric Code (NEC) requires consideration for hazardous areas including those where acetylene may be released during accidents or leaks. Consideration may include electrical classification and use of listed Group A electrical components in USA. Further information on determining the areas requiring special consideration is in NFPA 497. In Europe, ATEX also requires consideration for hazardous areas where <b>flammable</b> <b>gases</b> may be released during accidents or leaks.|$|E

2500|$|In 1769 Johan Gottlieb Gahn and Carl Wilhelm Scheele {{showed that}} calcium {{phosphate}} (...) {{is found in}} bones, and they obtained elemental phosphorus from bone ash. Antoine Lavoisier recognised phosphorus as an element in 1777. Bone ash was {{the major source of}} phosphorus until the 1840s. The method started by roasting bones, then employed the use of clay retorts encased in a very hot brick furnace to distill out the highly toxic elemental phosphorus product. Alternately, precipitated phosphates could be made from ground-up bones that had been de-greased and treated with strong acids. White phosphorus could then be made by heating the precipitated phosphates, mixed with ground coal or charcoal in an iron pot, and distilling off phosphorus vapour in a retort. Carbon monoxide and other <b>flammable</b> <b>gases</b> produced during the reduction process were burnt off in a flare stack.|$|E

2500|$|Despite their {{extremely}} low vapor pressures (≈10−10 Pa at 25˚C), some ionic liquids can be distilled under vacuum conditions at temperatures near 300°C. In the original work by Martyn Earle, et al., the authors wrongly {{concluded that the}} vapor {{was made up of}} individual, separated ions, but was later proven that the vapors formed consisted of ion-pairs. Some ionic liquids (such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate) generate <b>flammable</b> <b>gases</b> on thermal decomposition. Thermal stability and melting point depend on the liquid's components. Thermal stability of various RTILs (Room Temperature Ionic Liquid) are available. The thermal stability of a task-specific ionic liquid, protonated betaine bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide is of about [...] and N-Butyl-N-Methyl pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide was thermally stable up to 640 K. The upper limits of thermal stability of ionic liquids reported in the literature are usually based upon fast (about 10 K/min) TGA scans, and they do not imply long-term (several hours) thermal stability of ionic liquids, which is limited to less than 500 K for most ionic liquids.|$|E
2500|$|Citing {{conditions}} {{similar to}} those that resulted in the 2005 Texas City Refinery explosion, on 25 April 2006, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fined BP more than $2.4 million for unsafe operations at the company's Oregon, Ohio refinery. [...] An OSHA inspection resulted in 32 per-instance willful citations including locating people in vulnerable buildings among the processing units, failing to correct de-pressurization deficiencies and deficiencies with gas monitors, and failing to prevent the use of non-approved electrical equipment in locations in which hazardous concentrations of <b>flammable</b> <b>gases</b> or vapors may exist. [...] BP was further fined for neglecting to develop shutdown procedures and designate responsibilities and to establish a system to promptly address and resolve recommendations made after an incident when a large feed pump failed three years prior to 2006. [...] Penalties were also issued for five serious violations, including failure to develop operating procedures for a unit that removes sulfur compound; failure to ensure that operating procedures reflect current operating practice in the Isocracker Unit; failure to resolve process hazard analysis recommendations; failure to resolve process safety management compliance audit items in a timely manner; and failure to periodically inspect pressure piping systems.|$|E

These devices measure the <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> concentration via the heat produced by the catalysis of the gas by a heated catalytic coating. We propose the design and implementation of a readout system based on feedback heat pulses. In the proposed system, the heat of catalysis is directly measured via its compensation by a controlled feedback heat power. Contrary to that proposed sensor operation, previous potentiometric schemes would measure a sensor temperature increase resulting from the heat of catalysis. This proposed readout scheme for so-called "pellistor" sensors is expected to improve the measurement performance while providing a simpler implementation than previous systems...|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> {{and high}} voltage in {{detector}} systems {{is common in}} many experiments at Fermilab. To mitigate the hazards associated with these systems, Fermilab Engineering Standard SD- 45 B (Ref. 1) was adopted. Since this note {{is meant to be}} a guide and not a mandatory standard, each experiment is reviewed for compliance with SD- 45 B by the <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> safety subcommittee. Currently, there are only two types of <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> in use, ethane (Appendix A) and methane (Appendix B). The worst flammable-gas case is C 2 H 6 (ethane), which has an estimated flow rate that is 73 % of the CH 4 (methane) flow but a heat of combustion (in kcal/g-mole) that is 173 % of that of methane. In the worst case, if ethane were to spew through its restricting orifice into its gas line at 0 psig and then through a catastrophic leak into Room 215 (TRD) or Room 511 (CDC/FDCNTX), the time that would be required to build up a greater than Class 1 inventory (0. 4 kg H 2 equivalent) would be 5. 2 hours (Ref. 2). Therefore a worst-case <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> leak would have to go undetected for over 5 hours in order to transform a either mixing room to an environment with a Risk Class greater than Class 1. The mixing systems, gas lines, and detectors themselves will be thoroughly leak checked prior to active service. All vessels {{that are part of the}} mixing systems will be protected from overpressure by safety valves vented outside the building. Both the input and output of all detector volumes are protected from overpressure in the same way. The volume immediately outside the central tracking detectors is continuously purged by nitrogen from boiloff from the main nitrogen dewar at the site. However, if <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> were to build up in the mixing rooms or particular detector areas, no matter how unlikely, <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> detectors that are part of the interlock chain of each gas mixing system will shut down the appropriate system. This includes shutting off the output of <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> manifolds within the gas shed. Similarly, if a fire were to break out anywhere in the D-ZERO Hall, fire sensors would stop the output of all <b>flammable</b> <b>gas</b> manifolds within the gas shed, by unpowering electrically controlled solenoid valves that are normally closed in the event of a power failure. Fire sensor contacts have not yet been installed...|$|R
