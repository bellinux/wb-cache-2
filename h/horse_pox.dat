5|$|In 2017 Canadian {{scientists}} recreated an extinct <b>horse</b> <b>pox</b> {{virus to}} demonstrate that the smallpox virus can be recreated in a small lab {{at a cost of about}} $100,000, by a team of scientists without specialist knowledge. This makes the retention controversy moot since the virus can be easily recreated even if all samples are destroyed. Although the scientists performed the research to help development of new vaccines as well as trace smallpox's history, the possibility of the techniques being used for nefarious purposes was immediately recognized, leading to new regulation questions.|$|E
50|$|Capripoxvirus is a genus {{of viruses}} in the {{subfamily}} Chordopoxvirinae {{and the family}} Poxviridae. Capripoxviruses {{are among the most}} serious of all animal poxviruses. Sheep, goat, and cattle serve as natural hosts. These viruses cause negative economic consequences by damaging hides and wool and forcing the establishment of trade restrictions in response to an outbreak. The genus consists of three species: the type species: sheeppox virus (SPPV), goatpox virus (GTPV), and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV). They share no serological relationship with camel pox, <b>horse</b> <b>pox,</b> or avian poxes. Capripoxviruses for sheeppox and goatpox infect only sheep and goat respectively. However, it is probable that North American relatives, the mountain goat and mountain sheep, may be susceptible to the strains but has not been experimentally proven. Lumpy skin disease virus affects primarily cattle, but studies have been shown that giraffes and impala are also susceptible to LSDV. Humans cannot be infected by Capripoxviruses.|$|E
50|$|In {{the years}} from 1770 to 1790, at least six people who had contact with a cow had {{independently}} tested {{the possibility of using}} the cowpox vaccine as an immunization for smallpox in humans. Amongst them were the English farmer Benjamin Jesty, in Dorset in 1774 and the German teacher Peter Plett in 1791. Jesty inoculated his wife and two young sons with cowpox, in a successful effort to immunize them to smallpox, an epidemic of which had arisen in their town. His patients who had contracted and recovered from the similar but milder cowpox (mainly milkmaids), seemed to be immune not only to further cases of cowpox, but also to smallpox. By scratching the fluid from cowpox lesions into the skin of healthy individuals, he was able to immunize those people against smallpox. Reportedly, farmers and people working regularly with cattle and horses were often spared during smallpox outbreaks. Investigations by the British Army in 1790 showed that horse-mounted troops were less infected by smallpox than infantry, due to probable exposure to the similar <b>horse</b> <b>pox</b> virus (Variola equina). By the early 19th century, more than 100,000 people in Great Britain had been vaccinated. The arm-to-arm method of transfer of the cowpox vaccine was also used to distribute Jenner's vaccine throughout the Spanish Empire. Spanish king Charles IV's daughter had been stricken with smallpox in 1798, and after she recovered, he arranged {{for the rest of his}} family to be vaccinated. In 1803, the king, convinced of the benefits of the vaccine, ordered his personal physician Francis Xavier de Balmis, to deliver it to the Spanish dominions in North and South America. To maintain the vaccine in an available state during the voyage, the physician recruited 22 young boys who had never had cowpox or smallpox before, aged three to nine years, from the orphanages of Spain. During the trip across the Atlantic, de Balmis vaccinated the orphans in a living chain. Two children were vaccinated immediately before departure, and when cowpox pustules had appeared on their arms, material from these lesions was used to vaccinate two more children.|$|E
40|$|Luigi Sacco (1769 - 1863) {{has been}} the main protagonist of the first {{vaccination}} campaign in Italy, thanks {{to the discovery of}} a vaccine source by which he vaccinated more than 500. 000 people. Starting from the illustrations of his books (1081 and 1809), Sacco proposed to create wax models representing human, cow, sheep and <b>horse</b> <b>pox</b> viruses’ dermatological alterations. His purpose was that physicians and midwives, sawing these waxworks, could learn to distinguish the right pustules of animals’ pox viruses from which to extract the pus effective for humans’ vaccination. The model of human smallpox represented what he defined “real” and “spurious” vaccine pustules: the first ones caused by an effective vaccine, the second ones caused by an ineffective vaccine extracted from wrong animals’ pustules. In the University of Padua Museum of Pathological Anatomy there are the four wax models described by Sacco, which correspond exactly to the illustrations of his books. The same models are at the Milan, Pavia and Bologna Universities, that is, the principal towns, together with Padua, of the Cisalpine Republic created by Napoleon at that time...|$|E
