25|$|High Point was {{an early}} center for the {{development}} of the <b>furniture</b> <b>industry</b> in the South. Functional furniture had been produced on a small scale since the 17th century by artisans of English ancestry who had settled in North Carolina. As the farming landscape of the South began to change with the end of the Civil War and slavery, cheap labor became available during the Reconstruction Era. The North Carolina <b>furniture</b> <b>industry</b> gained momentum in the late 19th century, and developers were attracted to High Point for its location, transportation, and cheap labor. The city was situated ideally in the center of the Piedmont region with access to vast hardwood forests in the central and western parts of the state. High Point, located at the junction of the railroad and a main state road, was an ideal centralized shipping point for the southern market. An agricultural depression of the 1890s drove farm workers from the countryside to developing towns like High Point looking for industrial jobs.|$|E

25|$|The large {{profits in}} the North Carolina <b>furniture</b> <b>industry</b> lessened with the {{increasing}} number of factories.

2500|$|The <b>furniture</b> <b>industry</b> and {{developing}} textile manufacturing {{set the pace}} for two 20th century growth booms in High Point. Over {{the decade of the}} 1920s, the population grew from 14,302 to 36,745 as $20 million of building permits were issued and $26 million was spent on city improvements. The Great Depression did not seem to affect the southern furniture market which produced trendy and affordable furnishings as much as those in the North that produced traditional, luxurious products. Rebounding by 1935, North Carolina was second only to New York in US furniture production. Meanwhile, the High Point Market continued to set furniture trends and to be a national economic indicator; the $5 billion in sales in 1947 after World War II forecast a postwar boom. The 1950s' growth of the furniture market mirrored that of High Point's second population boom from 39,973 in 1950 to 62,063 in 1960.

[...] Four international furniture shows were being hosted by High Point at that time, including the High Point Market (still known then as the Southern Furniture Exposition), which The State reported was drawing crowds of five to six thousand buyers. Throughout the end of the 20th century, North Carolina continued to lead the nation in the production of both upholstered and wooden household furniture. The furniture was slightly styled and inexpensive, to meet the needs of all income levels, but lost its regional characteristics.

2500|$|Marketing became {{important}} to the phenomenal rise of the <b>furniture</b> <b>industry</b> in North Carolina in the twentieth century.

At the same time, competitors in large cities like New York and Chicago held a national exposition twice a year to display the manufacturers' products and to take orders from furniture dealers and buyers. Recognizing the need for a more convenient southern location, High Point furniture manufacturers began planning for an exposition to display and sell their product to the public. The first North Carolina furniture exposition was held in High Point in 1905. In 1921, a brand new Southern Furniture Exhibition Building was built with ten stories and [...] at a cost of $2 million. The event that became known as the High Point Furniture Market was attended by 700 buyers and generated $2.25 million in sales. High Point had overtaken Chicago as the site of the nation's most important semi-annual furniture show.
