500|$|The Hurt Locker {{is based}} on {{accounts}} of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad {{in the war in}} Iraq for two weeks in 2004. The director Kathryn Bigelow was familiar with Boal's work before his experiences, having adapted one of his Playboy articles as the short-lived television series The Inside in 2002. When Boal was embedded with the squad, he accompanied its members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks, and kept in touch with Bigelow via email about his experiences. Boal used his experiences as the basis of a fictional drama based on real events. He said of the film's goal, [...] "The idea is that it's the first movie about the Iraq War that purports to show the experience of the soldiers. We wanted to show {{the kinds of things that}} soldiers <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> you can't see on CNN, and I don't mean that in a censorship-conspiracy way. I just mean the news doesn't actually put photographers in with units that are this elite."

However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song {{for a while and}} when I heard it, it really just spoke to me. Sometimes you get to a point in your life where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you and you talk to yourself and you try to get yourself back on track.

2500|$|As much as possible, Buñuel {{preferred}} {{to work with}} actors and crew members {{with whom he had}} worked before and whom he trusted, leading some critics to refer to these people as a [...] "stock company", including such performers as: Fernando Rey, Francisco Rabal, Pierre Clementi, Julien Bertheau, Michel Piccoli, Claudio Brook, Silvia Pinal, Paul Frankeur and Georges Marchal. [...] In his final film, That Obscure Object of Desire, the central character was played by Rey, but voiced by the French-speaking Piccoli. He told actors as little as possible, and limited his directions mostly to physical movements ("move to the right", [...] "walk down the hall and <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> door", etc.), [...] arguing that he had a better chance of capturing reality with inexperienced players who projected a desired sense of awkwardness. [...] He often refused to answer actors' questions and was known to simply turn off his hearing aid on the set. [...] One of his stars, Catherine Deneuve, has stated: [...] "I've always thought that he likes actors, up to a point. I think he likes very much the idea of the film, and to write it. But I had the impression that the film-making was not what he {{preferred to}} do. He had to go through actors, and he liked them if they were easy, simple, not too much fuss." [...] Though they found it difficult at the time, many actors who worked with him acknowledged later that his approach made for fresh and excellent performances.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the fifth}} series, several {{people in the}} {{entertainment}} industry, including Ronan Keating, Noel Gallagher and Graham Norton questioned Minogue's judging credentials and mentoring ability. On 22 November 2008, during a live broadcast of the programme, Minogue broke down in tears {{and was unable to}} introduce one of her acts, Rachel Hylton, following an on-air row with Louis Walsh over a choice of song. Despite the controversies, she proved popular in public votes and polls. Minogue later stated that she did not enjoy her experience on the fifth series and [...] "would never want to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> again". Minogue returned for the sixth series in 2009. She chose Rachel Adedeji, Lucie Jones and Stacey Solomon as her final three acts to compete in the live shows and was assisted at the judges' houses stage by her older sister, Kylie Minogue. Despite losing Adedeji in week 4 and Jones the following week, Solomon went on to advance into the final and ultimately finish in third place. In 2010, Minogue was pregnant. She later stated that, as her baby's expected arrival in July would clash with filming for The X Factor, she would be unable to judge in the audition episodes for the seventh series. Minogue returned during the judges' houses round, selecting Nicolo Festa, Matt Cardle and Aiden Grimshaw as her final three, with Paije Richardson as her wildcard act. Minogue was assisted by fellow Australian and friend Natalie Imbruglia who was a guest judge in Birmingham that year filling in for Minogue. Cardle was her only act to make it into the final and eventually won, with Minogue becoming the winning mentor for the second time.|$|E
