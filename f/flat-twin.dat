25|$|The Model K was {{manufactured}} for {{one year}} and was replaced in 1917 by the Model O. The Model O had a four-stroke <b>flat-twin</b> engine and a new frame, but retained the pivoting fork at the front. The Model O was manufactured until 1919.|$|E
25|$|The Zephyr was {{the first}} of three light {{aircraft}} designed and built by the Aero Club of the RAE. It was designed by Samuel Childs. As the Club originally considered it as an entrant to the Lympne Motor Glider Competition where the Daily Mail prize of £1000 for a 50-mile flight was limited to aircraft with engines of less than 750 cc capacity, it was fitted with a 600 cc Douglas <b>flat-twin</b> engine that produced only about 20hp (15kW).|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Army {{also asked}} Harley-Davidson {{to produce a}} new {{motorcycle}} {{with many of the}} features of BMW's side-valve and shaft-driven R71. Harley largely copied the BMW engine and drive train and produced the shaft-driven 750cc 1942 Harley-Davidson XA. This shared no dimensions, no parts and no design concepts (except side valves) with any prior Harley-Davidson engine. Due to the superior cooling of the <b>flat-twin</b> engine with the cylinders across the frame, Harley's XA cylinder heads ran 100°F (56°C) cooler than its V-twins. The XA never entered full production: the motorcycle by that time had been eclipsed by the Jeep as the Army's general purpose vehicle, and the WLA—already in production—was sufficient for its limited police, escort, and courier roles. Only 1,000 were made and the XA never went into full production. It remains the only shaft-driven Harley-Davidson ever made.|$|E
50|$|From 1959 until 1962 Ratier made {{motorcycle}}s, {{having taken}} over the motorcycle business of the Centre d'Études de Moteurs à Explosion et à Combustion (CEMEC). The engines were <b>flat-twins</b> derived from Second World War BMW designs.|$|R
50|$|Two-stroke <b>flat-twins</b> were {{a popular}} choice {{for use in}} {{outboard}} motors, as they were smoother than single-cylinder engines. They lost popularity in the late 1940s to straight-twin two-strokes with 180-degree crankshafts that were easier to start and had an acceptable amount of vibration.|$|R
50|$|A straight-twin engine, {{also known}} as straight-two, inline-twin, vertical-twin, or parallel-twin is a {{two-cylinder}} piston engine which has its cylinders arranged side by side and its pistons connected to a common crankshaft. Compared to V-twins and <b>flat-twins,</b> straight-twins are more compact, simpler, and usually cheaper to make, but may generate more vibration during operation.|$|R
25|$|After many {{success at}} the 1000km enduro events, Meier was {{selected}} for the German Trophy Team for the 1937 International Six Day Trial {{to be held in}} Wales. Along with teammates Joseph Stelzer and Ludwig Wiggerl Kraus who competed with an 600cc BMW sidecar outfit, the German Trophy team then used 500cc <b>flat-twin</b> BMW motor-cycles. At the end of the six day trial the British and German Trophy teams where level on points. The event was to be decided on a speed-test at the new Castle Donington race circuit. The British Trophy team used 350cc machines and due to the handicap system, the 500cc BMW motorcycles had to complete an extra-lap to win the 1937 ISDT. Two of the British riders had extensive road-racing experience with Vic Brittain riding a Norton and George Rowley riding an AJS. Despite having no road racing experience, Meier won the Donington speed-trial, but the German Trophy Team lost the event to Great Britain Team by 10 seconds on the handicap system. The German Team officials were so impressed by Meier's performance that they suggested to BMW that he should be given a trial for their race-team.|$|E
500|$|Images of dragonflies {{are common}} in Art Nouveau, {{especially}} in jewellery designs. [...] They have also {{been used as a}} decorative motif on fabrics and home furnishings. Douglas, a British motorcycle manufacturer based in Bristol, named its innovatively designed postwar 350-cc <b>flat-twin</b> model the Dragonfly.|$|E
2500|$|DP.VII: Low-wing monoplane, {{powered by}} a [...] Haacke HFM 2 <b>flat-twin</b> engine.|$|E
50|$|Straight-twins {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being more compact, relatively simple, and cheaper to make in comparison to V- or <b>flat-twins.</b> They may be prone to vibration, either because of the irregular firing interval present in 180° crank engines or the large uncountered reciprocating mass in 360° crank engines. Inline-twins also suffer further from torsional torque reactions and vibration.|$|R
50|$|Inline twins with a 360° {{crankpin}} offset or <b>flat-twins</b> can {{be easily}} converted into twingles by firing both of the cylinders {{at the same time}} and installing a camshaft or camshafts that operate both cylinders' valves in parallel. Because many such engines already employ the wasted spark principle, only the camshaft modification is necessary. The Vintage Dirt Track Racing Association (VDTRA) 2010 Rules have banned vintage motorcycles from being set up as a twingle.|$|R
5000|$|The Dolson was a brass era {{automobile}} {{manufactured in}} Charlotte, Michigan by the J.L. Dolson & Sons from 1904 to 1907. They later changed {{the company name}} to the Dolson Automobile Company. The Dolson was a large car with a 60-horsepower engine. They offered a seven-seater touring car, that in 1907 cost US$3,250. It was advertised as the [...] "Mile-a-Minute" [...] car. They also offered smaller vehicles, with chain- and shaft-driven 20 hp <b>flat-twins,</b> and a shaft driven four of 28/30-horsepower.|$|R
2500|$|The Passe-Partout was the {{smallest}} and lightest de Marçay aircraft {{of the three}} {{on display at the}} Paris Aero Salon of 1919. It had a very low power engine, the same [...] ABC 8 hp adapted <b>flat-twin</b> motorcycle engine that powered the English Electric Wren. [...] Flight magazine doubted its practicality with this engine.|$|E
2500|$|The first shaft driven GS {{model was}} the R80G/S with a 797.5cc air-cooled, <b>flat-twin</b> boxer engine. [...] The BMW 247 engine, {{which was also}} fitted to many other bikes in the BMW range, is known as an airhead, because it relies on airflow across the {{cylinder}} heads and cylinder 'barrels' to provide most of the cooling for the engine. The most valued version was the R80G/S-PD [...] "Paris-Dakar" [...] model featuring a larger tank, which was launched in celebration of the R80G/S wins in the Paris Dakar Rally. In certain markets a 649.6cc R65GS version was also available. These early machines used a combined rear suspension and drive swingarm called a Monolever.|$|E
2500|$|BMW {{knew that}} it needed a four-seat family car {{to keep up with}} the rising wealth and {{expectations}} of the German people, but it could not access funding to develop a new car for this market. They therefore developed the 600, a four-seat car based on the Isetta. [...] The 600 used the front suspension, the front seats, and the front-mounted door from the Isetta, but used a new, longer ladder frame with a longer, four-seat body, a rear-mounted 0.6L <b>flat-twin</b> motorcycle engine, and a full-width rear track. [...] The 600's rear suspension was BMW's first use of the semi-trailing arm system that would be used on their sedans and coupes until the 1990s. [...] Released in 1957, the 600 could not compete against the larger, more powerful Volkswagen Beetle. [...] Production ended in 1959 after fewer than 35,000 were built.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of motorcycle engines are configured as singles, parallel twins, triples, fours and sixes; {{and all these}} may be inline or transverse. Vee engines include V-twins and V-fours, and horizontally opposed engines include <b>flat-twins,</b> flat-fours and flat-sixes. Wankel engines are either single-rotor or twin-rotor. Bigger bikes {{tend to have more}} cylinders for smoothness and increased power. Modern singles range in capacity from 50 cc to 660 cc, twins from 175 cc to 1,800 cc, triples from 380 cc to 2,300 cc, and so on.|$|R
5000|$|Tatra's {{specialty}} was {{luxury cars}} of a technically advanced nature, going from air-cooled <b>flat-twins</b> to fours and sixes, culminating (briefly) with the OHC 6-litre V12 in 1931. In the 1930s, {{under the supervision}} of Austrian engineer Hans Ledwinka, his son Erich and German engineer Erich Übelacker, and protected by high tariffs and absence of foreign assemblers, Tatra began building advanced, streamlined cars after obtaining licences from Paul Jaray, which started in 1934 with the large Tatra T77, the world's first production aerodynamic car. The average drag coefficient of a 1:5 model of the fastback Tatra T77 was recorded as 0.2455. [...] It featured (as did almost all subsequent big Tatras) a rear-mounted, air-cooled V8 engine, which was in technical terms very sophisticated for the time.|$|R
2500|$|Deterred {{from using}} 32hp (24kW) Bristol Cherub <b>flat-twin</b> engines owing to {{vibration}} problems, the Cockle {{began with a}} pair of V-twin Blackburne Tomtits. [...] Ungeared and so limited to the maximum 2,400 rpm of the propellers, the Tomtits could produce only 16hp (12kW). [...] It is not surprising that, {{when it came to the}} first flight, the Cockle was underpowered. [...] Before the aircraft was complete the bare hull (always Short's main concern) was floated for a day in April 1924 and found to be satisfactorily watertight. [...] Attempts to get it off the water began in September, but did not succeed until 7 November 1924, with its wing at a higher angle of incidence and its pilot lightly dressed. [...] It has been suggested that it flew only because the atmospheric pressure was exceptionally high that day.|$|E
2500|$|The all-wood Handasyde was a high-wing {{semi-cantilever}} monoplane, with parallel-chord wings {{that had}} slightly tapered tips. [...] The wings were built up around two spars {{and covered with}} 1mm plywood from the rear spar at mid-chord forward; on each side a lift strut linked the wing at about 1/3 span to the fuselage lower longeron. [...] The wing was then fabric covered, with a wire-supported scalloped trailing edge. It carried narrow ailerons outboard. [...] The fuselage was rectangular in cross section, tapering more in elevation than in plan. [...] There were no fixed stabilisers at the rear, only an all moving rudder and undivided elevator. [...] Both these surfaces were hinged to provide aerodynamic balance. [...] The single cockpit was over the wing and towards the trailing edge, with some instruments built into the wing surface. Ahead of the wing the fuselage was short, with the air-cooled 750 cc Douglas <b>flat-twin</b> driving a two-bladed propeller. [...] The diminutive undercarriage had thin and small diameter wheels (12 in or 305mm) on a single axle mounted on short vertical extensions from the lower longerons.|$|E
2500|$|The {{engine was}} {{designed}} by Walter Becchia and Lucien Gerard, with {{a nod to the}} classic BMW boxer motorcycle engine. It was an air-cooled, <b>flat-twin,</b> four-stroke, 375cc engine with pushrod operated overhead valves and a hemispherical combustion chamber. The earliest model developed [...] DIN (6.5kW). A 425cc engine was introduced in 1955, followed in 1968 by a 602cc one giving [...] at 7000rpm. With the 602cc engine, the tax classification of the car changed so that it became a 3CV, but the name remained unchanged. A 435cc engine was introduced {{at the same time to}} replace the 425cc; the 435cc engine car was named 2CV 4 while the 602cc took the name 2CV 6 (a variant in Argentina took the name 3CV). The 602cc engine evolved to the M28 [...] in 1970; this was the most powerful engine fitted to the 2CV. A new 602cc giving [...] at a slower 5,750rpm was introduced in 1979. This engine was less powerful, [...] and more efficient, allowing lower fuel consumption and better top speed, at the price of decreased acceleration. All 2CVs with the M28 engine can run on unleaded petrol.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was flat-sided, {{built up}} around four longerons which {{were made of}} spruce at the rear and ash forward of the cockpit. [...] Behind the cockpit, the fuselage narrowed in plan view in a gently curved way to the tail, but less usually Comper made the fuselage reduce in depth also; whilst the upper longeron was horizontal with the aircraft in flying position, the lower one was angled upwards. [...] The fin and rudder formed an approximate quadrant, though the unbalanced rudder extended down between the elevators to the fuselage bottom. [...] The nearly rectangular tailplane was mounted on the upper longeron. A standard curved decking, built up with stringers over frames topped the fuselage from front to rear. Forward of the cockpit the lower longerons curved strongly upwards and inwards, meeting the now inward curving upper members at the engine bulkhead, on which was mounted the 32hp (24kW) Bristol Cherub I <b>flat-twin</b> driving a two-bladed small diameter propeller. The single axle undercarriage was mounted {{on a pair of}} short V-shaped legs, each V cut out of plywood and mounted vertically on the lower longerons, so that the track was about 4ft (1.22 m). The CLA.2 sat close to the ground, with its wheels only slightly ahead of and below the wing leading edge.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, {{motorcycle}} manufacturer Douglas built generators {{powered by}} their <b>flat-twin</b> engines, Norman Engineering Company produced flat twin generators from 1932 to 1968, and Enfield Industrial Engines (part of Enfield Cycle Company) produced 250 cc and 350 cc flat twin 2-stroke petrol stationary engines {{during the war}} which were used for generators and other military uses. After the war they built <b>flat-twin</b> air-cooled diesel engines, with applications ranging from farm use to marine use. Coventry-Victor introduced a diesel version of their existing 688 cc petrol <b>flat-twin</b> in 1932, {{and went on to}} produce <b>flat-twin</b> diesel and petrol engines for a variety of industrial and marine uses well into the post-war period.|$|E
50|$|The first {{motorcycle}} with a boxer {{engine was}} the 1905 Fée <b>flat-twin,</b> which was developed into the 1907 Douglas. Douglas would continue making <b>flat-twin</b> motorcycles until 1957, {{ending with the}} Dragonfly. BMW have made motorcycles with <b>flat-twin</b> engines since the BMW R32 of 1923. Unlike contemporary Douglas motorcycles, which had their engines mounted with the cylinders {{in line with the}} frame, the R32 had its cylinders mounted across the frame and used a shaft to drive the rear wheel. The drivetrain layout of the R32 has been used, with improvements, in all subsequent BMW <b>flat-twin</b> motorcycles. The Russian Ural and Ukrainian Dnepr flat twins were licensed copies of the pre-WWII military plunger-suspension BMW R71.|$|E
50|$|In larger aircraft, <b>flat-twin</b> engines {{have been}} used in {{auxiliary}} power units (APUs). A notable example was made by ABC Motors between the World Wars. During World War II, the Riedel firm in Germany designed and manufactured a two-stroke <b>flat-twin</b> engine to start Junkers Jumo 004 axial-flow turbojets.|$|E
50|$|The {{company began}} as an {{aircraft}} engine manufacturer in the early 20th century and through World War I. BMW manufactured its first motorcycle in 1923, the R32, which featured a <b>flat-twin</b> boxer engine. BMW Motorrad still uses the <b>flat-twin</b> boxer configuration, but now manufactures motorcycles {{with a variety of}} engine configurations.|$|E
