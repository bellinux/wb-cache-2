To use the existing micro-arc oxide coating (MOC) methods for work-pieces of various forms and sizes in a plating vat is complicated in case it is required to provide oxide layers in separate places rather than over entire surface of a work-piece. The challenge is to treat flat surfaces in various directions, external and internal surfaces of rotation bodies, profiled surfaces, intersections, closed and through holes, pipes, as well as spline and thread openings for ensuring anti-seize properties in individual or small-scale production to meet technical requirements and operational properties of products. A design of tools to provide MOC-process of all possible surfaces of various engineering box-type products depends on many factors and can be considerably different even when processing the surfaces of the same forms. An attachment to be used is fixed directly on a large-sized design (a work-piece, a product) or fastened in the special tool. The features of technological process, design shape, and arrangement of the processed surfaces define a fastening method of the attachment. Therefore it is necessary to pay much attention to a choice of the processing pattern and a design of tools.

A suitable volumetric flow rate of electrolyte through each half-cell was found to be in the range 1. 5 – 2. 0 mL min? 1, corresponding to a mean linear <b>electrolyte</b> <b>velocity</b> of 1. 0 – 10. 1 cm s? 1 through the carbon felt electrode. At a constant current charge and discharge current density of 100 mA cm? 2 the typical voltage efficiencies were 65 %. Charge-discharge curves were then simulated using a detailed physical model, which generated good quantitative agreement with experimental cell performance. CONCLUSIONS: This study has quantified the effect of key process variables on cell efficiency. A mathematical model has been used successfully to describe charge-discharge performance and the use of open-circuit cell voltage has been shown to provide a simple and useful means of cell monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Sensorial {{surfaces}} {{are a new}} generation of sensors for the use in condition monitoring. In contrast to conventional micro- or thin-film-sensors the sensor structures of sensorial {{surfaces are}} manufactured directly on the part to be monitored and are not mounted as separate sensor modules. By using microsystems technology, the sensor structures can be miniaturized and the measurement data can be gauged very closely to the occurance of the physical quantity. To enhance the mechanical durability of the sensor layers, the manufacturing process should result in a completely flat surface. This can be achieved by embedding the sensor layer into an insulation layer or directly into the surface of the part to be monitored. To do this, the surface needs to be structured {{in the shape of the}} sensor geometry. This thesis deals with a novel concept for Electrochemical Micro-Machining (EMM). EMM is a method of removing metal locally on the micrometer scale in a quick and cost efficient way. It is especially suited for hardened steels because it is run at room temperature. It does neither bring in thermal stress nor does it reduce the hardness of the steel. The thesis describes a Finite-Element-Method (FEM) model as well as an analytical model for a better understanding of the theoretical background of the process regarding the depth and resolution of the manufactured structures. Furthermore, the fabrication of a new type of structured counter- (work-) electrode is presented for different applications. The thesis concludes with the presentation of several results of manufactured structures and a comparison of the theoretical models with the practical results. Two models were developed to understand the influence of relevant parameters like current density, conductivity and velocity of the electrolyte and the distance between the tool and the workpiece on the resulting depth and resolution of the manufactured structures. The FEM model can predict the depth of the structure as well as its resolution. With the analytical model it is possible to investigate the influence of the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>velocity</b> on the structure depth. Both models are based on the assumption, that high current densities (above 30 A/cm 2) are used because the material removal rate is proportional to the amount of charge that is transported between the electrodes in this regime. In general it can be concluded that the lateral resolution decreases as the distance between the electrodes gets smaller. The depth of the structure increases over the length of the fluidic channel due to the metal ion concentration. This effect can be attenuated by using channels that decrease their cross section over their length and thus accelerate the electrolyte. The depth is also dependent on the area of the counter electrode. Larger areas yield in deeper structures. The new generation of tool electrodes are fabricated with the use of microsystem technologies. The fluidic channel is directly integrated into the electrodes. Rigid electrodes for planar work pieces as well as flexible electrodes for cylindrical work pieces are presented. With flexible, multi-layered electrodes it is possible to produce several different structures that are aligned with an accuracy of 1 &# 956;m. The practical results of the manufactured structures back the theoretical results of both models. The work distance between the electrodes is 20 &# 956;m and resolutions of 50 &# 956;m can be achieved. It is possible to use flexible counter electrodes with 500 nm thick metallic layers at up to 100 A/cm 2. Three-dimensional structures can be fabricated on cylindrical surfaces in a few seconds. The typical process length for a 5 &# 956;m deep structure is about 20 s and does not depend on the structured area...|$|E
40|$|Dissolution {{processes}} at {{single crystal}} surfaces often involve the initial formation {{and expansion of}} localized, characteristic (faceted) etch-pits at defects, in an otherwise comparatively unreactive surface. Using natural gypsum single crystal as an example, a simple but powerful morphological analysis of these characteristic etch pit features is proposed that allows important questions concerning dissolution kinetics to be addressed. Significantly, quantitative mass transport associated with reactive microscale interfaces in quiescent solution (well known {{in the field of}} electrochemistry at ultramicroelectrodes) allows the relative importance of diffusion compared to surface kinetics to be assessed. Furthermore, because such mass transport rates are high, much faster surface kinetics can be determined than with existing dissolution methods. For the case of gypsum, surface processes are found to dominate the kinetics at early stages of the dissolution process (small etch pits) on the cleaved (010) surface. However, the contribution from mass transport becomes more important with time due to the increased area of the reactive zones and associated decrease in mass transport rate. Significantly, spatial heterogeneities in both surface kinetics and mass transport effects are identified, and the morphology of the characteristic etch features reveal direction-dependent dissolution kinetics that can be quantified. Effective dissolution velocities normal to the main basal (010) face are determined, along with velocities for the movement of [001] and [100] oriented steps. Inert <b>electrolyte</b> enhances dissolution <b>velocities</b> in all directions (salting in), but a striking new observation is that the effect is direction-dependent. Studies of common ion effects reveal that Ca 2 + has a much greater impact in reducing dissolution rates compared to SO 42 −. With this approach, the new microscopic observations can be further analysed to obtain macroscopic dissolution rates, which are found to be wholly consistent with previous bulk measurements. The studies are thus important in bridging the gap between microscopic phenomena and macroscopic measurements...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{reduction}} of CO 2 in aqueous buffer solutions of different pHs at tin electrodes was studied. The partial current densities exhibited the expected two Tafel regions; with increasingly negative electrode potential, {{the first to}} be encountered depended on pH strongly, while the second showed only weak dependence. Formate and CO were observed as the main products. In the range of potentials studied, the highest charge yield of 0. 67 was achieved at - 1. 55 V (AgCl|Ag) in 0. 5 M NaOH saturated with 1 atm CO 2 with a total current density of 36. 2 A m- 2. pH was also found to affect the formation ratios of CO to formate, the value of which ranged from 1 to 0. 15 as pH was increased from 2. 9 to 7. 8. However, pH was not an ideal variable to adjust the product distributions because lower pH led to a lower charge yield of CO 2 reduction due to increasingly competing hydrogen evolution. Two mathematical kinetic models based on slightly different concepts were developed to quantify the dependence of the formation ratios on pH and to predict partial current densities of CO 2 reduction at different pHs and electrode potentials. The first model assumed that there could be multiple reactions having different stoichiometric coefficients of proton consumption occurring simultaneously; the greater the coefficient, the stronger was the preference for CO production from the reaction. The other concept was that there were multiple protonation states of the intermediate in CO 2 reduction; the higher the protonation state, the higher was the tendency to form CO from the intermediate. Both concepts allowed variations of the product ratios as a function of pH, but the latter model was preferred because more accurate predictions of the partial current densities were achieved and a generalised reaction mechanism could be derived. Electrochemical {{reduction of}} CO 2 in 0. 5 M NaOH saturated with 1 atm CO 2 at tin-coated graphite felt electrodes was also studied. Tin was deposited on graphite felt from aqueous solutions of 0. 3 M K 2 [Sn(OH) 6], 0. 4 M KOH and 0. 5 M K 3 PO 4. The effects of electrode potential and electrolyte flow rates on the performances of CO 2 reduction at 3 D electrodes were explored. The best performance was achieved at - 1. 62 V (AgCl|Ag) and 99 ml min- 1 electrolyte flow rate; the total current density and the charge yield of formate were 971 A m- 2 and 0. 58, respectively. Accumulation of gas bubbles composed of H 2 and CO was found to have detrimental effects on superficial electrolyte conductivities and mass transport of CO 2, but can be partially alleviated by increasing the electrolyte flow rate. Two mathematical models were developed to include the effect of flow rates into account in predicting total current densities and formate charge yields from 3 D electrodes. The first model assumed that the gas bubbles inside porous electrodes travelled at the same <b>velocities</b> as the <b>electrolyte</b> solutions; this led to highly under-predicted potential drops across the electrode thickness and over-predicted total current densities. On the other hand, the second model allowed slip between bubble flows and electrolyte flows, resulting in more accurate predictions. Bubbles were found to travel 0. 0016 times slower than <b>electrolyte</b> flow <b>velocities.</b> Open Acces...|$|R
