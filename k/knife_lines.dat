Although double edged blades are usually considered {{by law enforcement}} as weapons, in situations where they are acceptable they have a few advantages. Having twice the edge length of a single edge knife {{they can be used}} longer between sharpenings. This advantage may be offset however because the thumb of the cutting hand can't press against the spine of the blade. With a single edged blade thumb pressure is often exerted for heavy cutting chores.|$|R

But a sudden, terrific, {{downward}} jerking of the boat, quickly brought his <b>knife</b> to the <b>line.</b> He cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney's red woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.|$|R
50|$|Gyuto: (literally beef-sword). The chefs knife for {{professional}} Western cuisine. For vegetables, {{it is used}} to chop or thrust cut like a nakiri near the heel, to rock-chop stiffer produce in the belly, and to make fine cuts at the tip. For meat, {{it is used to}} saw back and forth for large cuts, to pull cut for softer meats and for a better surface finish, and to push cut for more sinewy meat. There is usually a slope from heel to tip which causes the wrist to point down and shoulder to raise up to make cuts. General size is 210 mm to 270 mm. 210 is more of a <b>line</b> <b>knife</b> size and most nimble, 240 is more of a general purpose size and allows more slicing, and 270 has more slicing power but is much more cumbersome, being the tallest and longest.|$|R
60|$|Obs. 8. I {{caused the}} edges of two Knives to be ground truly strait, and {{pricking}} their points into a Board so that their edges might look towards one another, and meeting near their points contain a rectilinear Angle, I fasten'd their Handles together with Pitch to make this Angle invariable. The distance of {{the edges of}} the Knives from one another at the distance of four Inches from the angular Point, where {{the edges of the}} Knives met, was the eighth part of an Inch; and therefore the Angle contain'd by the edges was about one Degree 54: The Knives thus fix'd together I placed in a beam of the Sun's Light, let into my darken'd Chamber through a Hole the 42d Part of an Inch wide, at the distance of 10 or 15 Feet from the Hole, and let the Light which passed between their edges fall very obliquely upon a smooth white Ruler at the distance of half an Inch, or an Inch from the Knives, and there saw the Fringes by the two edges of the Knives run along the edges of the Shadows of the <b>Knives</b> in <b>Lines</b> parallel to those edges without growing sensibly broader, till they met in Angles equal to the Angle contained by the edges of the Knives, and where they met and joined they ended without crossing one another. But if the Ruler was held at a much greater distance from the Knives, the Fringes where they were farther from the Place of their Meeting, were a little narrower, and became something broader and broader as they approach'd nearer and nearer to one another, and after they met they cross'd one another, and then became much broader than before.|$|R
60|$|Obs. 10. When the Fringes of the Shadows of the Knives fell perpendicularly upon a Paper {{at a great}} {{distance}} from the Knives, {{they were in the}} form of Hyperbola's, and their Dimensions were as follows. Let CA, CB [in Fig. 3.] represent Lines drawn upon the Paper parallel to the edges of the Knives, and between which all the Light would fall, if it passed between the edges of the Knives without inflexion; DE a Right Line drawn through C making the Angles ACD, BCE, equal to one another, and terminating all the Light which falls upon the Paper from the point where the edges of the Knives meet; eis, fkt, and glv, three hyperbolical Lines representing the Terminus of the Shadow of one of the <b>Knives,</b> the dark <b>Line</b> {{between the first and second}} Fringes of that Shadow, and the dark Line between the second and third Fringes of the same Shadow; xip, ykq, and zlr, three other hyperbolical Lines representing the Terminus of the Shadow of the other <b>Knife,</b> the dark <b>Line</b> between the first and second Fringes of that Shadow, and the dark line between the second and third Fringes of the same Shadow. And conceive that these three Hyperbola's are like and equal to the former three, and cross them in the points i, k, and l, and that the Shadows of the Knives are terminated and distinguish'd from the first luminous Fringes by the lines eis and xip, until the meeting and crossing of the Fringes, and then those lines cross the Fringes in the form of dark lines, terminating the first luminous Fringes within side, and distinguishing them from another Light which begins to appear at i, and illuminates all the triangular space ipDEs comprehended by these dark lines, and the right line DE. Of these Hyperbola's one Asymptote is the line DE, and their other Asymptotes are parallel to the lines CA and CB. Let rv represent a line drawn any where upon the Paper parallel to the Asymptote DE, and let this line cross the right lines AC in m, and BC in n, and the six dark hyperbolical lines in p, q, r; s, t, v; and by measuring the distances ps, qt, rv, and thence collecting the lengths of the Ordinates np, nq, nr or ms, mt, mv, and doing this at several distances of the line rv from the Asymptote DD, you may find as many points of these Hyperbola's as you please, and thereby know that these curve lines are Hyperbola's differing little from the conical Hyperbola. And by measuring the lines Ci, Ck, Cl, you may find other points of these Curves.|$|R
60|$|Obs. 9. When the Rays fell very obliquely {{upon the}} Ruler at the {{distance}} of the third Part of an Inch from the <b>Knives,</b> the dark <b>Line</b> {{between the first and second}} Fringe of the Shadow of one Knife, and the dark Line between the first and second Fringe of the Shadow of the other knife met with one another, at {{the distance of}} the fifth Part of an Inch from the end of the Light which passed between the Knives at the concourse of their edges. And therefore {{the distance of the}} edges of the Knives at the meeting of these dark Lines was the 160th Part of an Inch. For as four Inches to the eighth Part of an Inch, so is any Length of the edges of the Knives measured from the point of their concourse to the distance of the edges of the Knives at the end of that Length, and so is the fifth Part of an Inch to the 160th Part. So then the dark Lines above-mention'd meet in the middle of the Light which passes between the Knives where they are distant the 160th Part of an Inch, and the one half of that Light passes by the edge of one Knife at a distance not greater than the 320th Part of an Inch, and falling upon the Paper makes the Fringes of the Shadow of that Knife, and the other half passes by the edge of the other Knife, at a distance not greater than the 320th Part of an Inch, and falling upon the Paper makes the Fringes of the Shadow of the other Knife. But if the Paper be held at a distance from the Knives greater than the third Part of an Inch, the dark Lines above-mention'd meet at a greater distance than the fifth Part of an Inch from the end of the Light which passed between the Knives at the concourse of their edges; and therefore the Light which falls upon the Paper where those dark Lines meet passes between the Knives where the edges are distant above the 160th part of an Inch.|$|R
