25|$|Another {{closely related}} {{manifold}} {{is the real}} projective plane. If a circular disk <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> of the real projective plane, what is left is a Möbius strip. Going in the other direction, if one glues a disk to a Möbius strip by identifying their boundaries, {{the result is the}} projective plane. To visualize this, it is helpful to deform the Möbius strip so that its boundary is an ordinary circle (see above). The real projective plane, like the Klein bottle, cannot be embedded in three-dimensions without self-intersections.|$|E

50|$|As {{the driver}} notched up, {{some of the}} {{resistor}} banks <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> via the pneumatically-operated switches and the voltage increased across the traction motors. As the driver notched higher, more resistors <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> and more power {{was developed by the}} traction motors. At around 22 to 28 km/h the unit switched to a parallel combination where the two traction motors per bogie were in a series electrical circuit while the two bogies were in a parallel electrical circuit. Eventually, when all resistors <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out,</b> the unit <b>was</b> operating in full-field.|$|R
500|$|There are two flags {{used by the}} Young Pioneers of China. The first {{flag that}} is used is for large detachments. The length of the flag is 90 {{centimetres}} and the width is 120 centimeters. [...] A golden badge of the Young Pioneers {{is placed in the}} center of the flag. For a medium detachment, a modified flag is used. The flag has a length of 60 centimetres and a width of 80 centimetres. A 20-centimeter triangle <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> of the fly edge of the flag and the golden emblem is shifted closer towards the hoist.|$|E
500|$|The castle {{comprises}} three circular towers—the Keep, the Kitchen Tower and the Well Tower—along {{with the}} Hall Block, the Gatehouse and a shell wall; the buildings almost entirely encase the original motte in stone. The older {{parts of the}} castle are constructed from crudely laid red sandstone rubble and grey limestone, the 19th-century additions in more precisely cut red Pennant sandstone. A ditch <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> of the rock {{in front of the}} Gatehouse and leads to an eastern approach road. The castle is surrounded by woodland and the 19th-century vineyards below it have been converted into a golf course. In 1850, George Clark recorded an [...] "outer court" [...] of which nothing remains; this may, in fact, have been the traces of the earlier lime kiln operations around the site.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Xerxes {{design is}} deliberately {{a radical departure}} from the traditional suspended sub-chassis design. Instead of having a three-point sprung suspension separating the plinth from the sub-chassis, the Xerxes is made up of two boards separated from each other by stiff rubber [...] "Blobs". The top plinth sees mountings for the main bearing and tonearm. A hole <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> from the top board for the motor assembly to emerge from its fixture on the board below. On the lower board, to which an outer surround is attached, three compliant rubber feet give additional isolation to the turntable's chosen placement. One notable characteristic of the deck is the large C-shaped groove cut into the top plinth to control how vibrations would be transmitted from platter to the tonearm area. However, the cut-out is prone to a commonly observed [...] "plinth sag", where the part of it would bend out of true {{with the rest of the}} board.|$|E

500|$|Work on the Washington Parade Grounds between Willett and Knox streets {{was begun}} in July 1870 and {{finished}} {{by the end}} of the year. During 1871 the former cemetery was landscaped and that area reopened as part of the park. The section of Washington Park between Lexington (formerly Snipe) and Robin streets was the focus of work in 1873, including the damming of the Beaverkill to form Washington Park Lake. In 1874 focus shifted to roughly [...] along Madison Avenue from Lake to Robin and a footbridge was built over the lake in 1875. Nine acres of mostly row houses along Knox Street north of Madison were purchased, destroyed, and landscaped in 1880; this included the area that would be the site of the King Memorial Fountain. The large house and landscaped grounds of John Taylor was the last part of the park to be purchased, in 1882, since 1889 it has been the site of tennis courts. The northwestern corner that <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> of the park's otherwise rectangular shape was never part of the park; those plots were mostly owned by the Barnes family and developed into urban mansions facing Thurlow Terrace and Englewood Place. The process of buying and improving the land piecemeal was criticized because each improvement raised the value of the existing land that still needed to be purchased. The increase in property value can be shown through the value of the lands surrounding Washington Park almost doubling in the six years in which the majority of the park improvements were made; from $2,696,688 in 1869 to $4,843,440 in 1875. The properties next to Washington Park on Robin Street, which was renamed Englewood Terrace, increased in value from $9,500 in 1875 to $175,800 by 1891.|$|E

The frames are collected and the comb <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> in chunks before packaging. As an alternative to this labor-intensive method, plastic rings or cartridges can be used that do not require manual cutting of the comb, and speed packaging. Comb honey harvested in the traditional manner is also referred to as [...] "cut-comb honey".|$|E

The portion of the loaf that <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> along this seal is the Lamb (Host), from which all are communicated, and therefore must be proportionately large for the number of communicants.|$|E
2500|$|The strongest {{evidence}} {{in favor of}} the Hodge conjecture is the algebraicity result of [...] [...] Suppose that we vary the complex structure of X over a simply connected base. [...] Then the topological cohomology of X does not change, but the Hodge decomposition does change. [...] It is known that if the Hodge conjecture is true, then the locus of all points on the base where the cohomology of a fiber is a Hodge class is in fact an algebraic subset, that is, it <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> by polynomial equations. [...] Cattani, Deligne & Kaplan (1995) proved that this is always true, without assuming the Hodge conjecture.|$|E

2500|$|The {{video is}} {{credited}} for making Oakey, Sulley and Catherall visual icons {{of the early}} 1980s but became controversial later for a scene involving the murder-mystery film subplot where Jo Callis appears to shoot Catherall (and later in the video repeated with Oakey shooting Sulley) with a pistol from a car window (a Saab 99 turbo). The scene <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> of the DVD version and usually on music television, replaced with a montage of other shots from the video edited in slow-motion.

2500|$|The {{right side}} of a positive-sensed AAV genome encodes {{overlapping}} sequences of three capsid proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3, which start from one promoter, designated p40. The molecular weights of these proteins are 87, 72 and 62 kiloDaltons, respectively. All {{three of them are}} translated from one mRNA. After this mRNA is synthesized, it can be spliced in two different manners: either a longer or shorter intron can be excised resulting in the formation of two pools of mRNAs: a 2.3 kb- and a 2.6 kb-long mRNA pool. Usually, especially in the presence of adenovirus, the longer intron is preferred, so the 2.3-kb-long mRNA represents the so-called [...] "major splice". In this form the first AUG codon, from which the synthesis of VP1 protein starts, <b>is</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out,</b> resulting in a reduced overall level of VP1 protein synthesis. The first AUG codon that remains in the major splice is the initiation codon for VP3 protein. However, upstream of that codon in the same open reading frame lies an ACG sequence (encoding threonine) which is surrounded by an optimal Kozak context. This contributes to a low level of synthesis of VP2 protein, which is actually VP3 protein with additional N terminal residues, as is VP1.|$|E
