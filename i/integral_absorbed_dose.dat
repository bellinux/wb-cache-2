40|$|A {{computer}} program {{was developed to}} calculate both <b>integral</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> in a water phantom and entrance exposure, for the imaging of iodine contrast with x-ray intensifying screens. The effect of filtration of the x-ray beam on <b>integral</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> and entrance exposure was studied for 27 different filter materials and four types of intensifying screens. The dose and exposure were calculated, keeping the image contrast and energy absorption in the screens constant. To check {{the validity of the}} calculations, a number of measurements were performed, the results of which agreed well with our calculations. A remarkable result is that dose and exposure reduction can be achieved almost equally well with conventional filters (aluminum and copper) as with a number of K-edge filters. This was found for situations commonly encountered in diagnostic radiology (60 - 80 kV, 20 cm water). This finding is in contrast to a number of earlier studies, in which K-edge filters were found to be superior to conventional filter...|$|E
40|$|Conventional and {{panoramic}} complete-mouth x-ray examinations {{differ in}} so many respects that {{a comparison of the}} amount of radiation administered to the patient cannot be made with the use of exposure measurements in roentgens. The <b>integral</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> being the total amount of energy absorbed by the patient and expressed in gram rads or ergs, is more suitable for this purpose. This dose was determined by measuring the amount of energy passing through a cross section of the x-ray beam before entering the patient. The <b>integral</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> for a complete-mouth examination with the conventional technique was, for two different techniques, 700 and 1, 300 gram rads. It can be shown that, for the conventional technique, an increase in KVP reduces the amount of radiation which the patient receives, but not as dramatically as the skin exposure suggests. Examination by the panoramic technique with the Orthopantomograph delivers 110 gram rads to the patient, whereas 19 gram rads is administered during examination with the Panoramix. These findings constitute an argument in favor of the new techniques and emphasize the need to consider them when selecting a technique for a complete-mouth examination...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Efforts {{are made}} in {{radiographic}} examinations to obtain the best image quality with the lowest possible absorbed dose to the patient. In dental radiography, the absorbed dose to patients is very low, but exposures are relatively frequent. It {{has been suggested that}} frequent low-dose exposures can pose a risk for development of future cancer. It has previously been reported that {{there was no significant difference}} in the diagnostic accuracy of approximal carious lesions in radiographs obtained using tube voltages of 60 and 70 kV. The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the patient dose resulting from exposures at these tube voltages to obtain intraoral bitewing radiographs. Material and Methods: The absorbed dose distributions resulting from two bitewing exposures were measured at tube voltages of 60 and 70 kV using Gafchromic ® film and an anatomical head phantom. The dose was measured in the occlusal plane, and ± 50 mm cranially and caudally to evaluate the amount of scattered radiation. The same entrance dose to the phantom was used. The absorbed dose was expressed as the ratio of the maximal doses, the mean doses and the integral doses at tube voltages of 70 and 60 kV. Results: The patient receives approximately 40 - 50 % higher (mean and <b>integral)</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> when a tube voltage of 70 kV is used. Conclusions: The results of this study clearly indicate that 60 kV should be used for dental intraoral radiographic examinations for approximal caries detection...|$|E

40|$|The {{radiation}} field in low Earth orbit (LEO) and deep space is complicated. The radiation impact on astronauts depends strongly on the particles’ {{linear energy transfer}} (LET) and is dominated by high LET radiation. Radiation risk is a key concern for human space flight and can be estimated with radiation LET spectra measured for the different organs of an astronaut phantom. At present the best passive personal dosimeters used for astronauts are thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) and optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLDs) for low LET and CR- 39 plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTDs) for high LET. CR- 39 PNTDs, TLDs and OSLDs {{were used for the}} MATROSHKA- 1 experiment to measure radiation experienced by astronauts outside the international space station (ISS). LET spectra and {{radiation field}} quantities (differential and <b>integral</b> fluence, <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> and dose equivalent) were measured for the different organs and skin locations of the MAROSHKA phantom using CR- 39 PNTDs and TLDs. The spectra and results can be used to determine the radiation quantities for astronaut's extra vehicular activity (EVA) and for the further in-depth study of the radiation risk for astronauts. Sensitivity fading of CR- 39 detectors was observed for the MATROSHKA experiment and a practical method was developed to correct it. This paper presents the radiation LET spectra measured with CR- 39 PNTDs and the total radiation quantities combined from results measured with CR- 39 PNTDs and TLDs. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Esophageal {{cancer is}} one of the most {{frequently}} occurring cancers in Iran and having a  high  incidence  rate  among  other  countries.  Radiotherapy  is  one  of  the  three  methods  (surgery,  radiotherapy and chemotherapy) for radical or palliative treatment of esophageal cancer. In this method  of treatment, the organs such as heart and spinal cord are regarded as organs at risk (OAR) which their  dose should be kept below the tolerance level.   Different techniques have been used in conventional radiotherapy, among which two parallel opposed  fields (POP) is used more often either for the whole course of the treatment or 2 / 3 of the fractions. In  this technique, a great portion of the spinal cord may be involved in the treatment volume.   The rate of treatment success may depend on the tolerance dose of heart and cord which act as the  limiting factor.   Materials and  Methods:  In this  study, 10 patients  with S. C. C.  of  esophagus having  indication  for  external radiotherapy were selected. The CT scan simulations were performed for all the cases and  their data were digitized to be used in computerized treatment planning system. Treatment planning for  three photon beam energies (Co- 60, 6 and 10 MV) are obtained for each individual patient under the  same geometry and <b>dose.</b> The <b>integral</b> <b>dose,</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> and dose volume histogram (DVH) of the  heart and target were calculated for all the cases.   Results: The maximum point dose in the heart is 140, 125 and 115 % of the reference point for Co- 60,  6 and 10 MV, respectively. The integral dose for the largest A-P patient was found to be 55. 33, 54. 17   and 51. 66 Gy. Kg for Co- 60, 6 and 10 MV, respectively. In using 10 MV beam, 7 % reduction in the  integral dose of the heart was obtained. Alternatively, by using 6 MV beam, a reduction of only 2 %  was observed. The integral dose of the heart for the 10 MV beam had a 5 % reduction in comparison to  6 MV beam.   Discussion and Conclusion:  Since lower energy beams cause a higher integral dose to the heart and  cord, the use of higher energy photon beams in the case of deep seated tumors and large size patients  are unavoidable. In spite of the advantages of cobalt machines, its energy is not suitable for deeply  suited tumors...|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{field of}} {{particles}} in low Earth orbit (LEO) is mainly composed of {{galactic cosmic rays}} (GCR), solar energetic particles and particles in SAA (South Atlantic Anomaly). GCR are modulated by solar activity, at the period of solar minimum activity, GCR intensity is at maximum and the main contributor for space radiation is GCR. At present for space radiation measurements conducted by JSC (Johnson Space Center) SRAG (Space Radiation Analysis Group), the preferred active dosimeter sensitive to all LET (Linear Energy Transfer) is the tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC); the preferred passive dosimeters are thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) and optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLDs) sensitive to low LET as well as CR- 39 plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTDs) sensitive to high LET. For the method using passive dosimeters, radiation quantities for all LET {{can be obtained by}} combining radiation results measured with TLDs/OSLDs and CR- 39 PNTDs. TEPC, TLDs/OSLDs and CR- 39 detectors were used to measure the radiation field for the ISS (International Space Station) - Expedition 18 - 19 /ULF 2 space mission which was conducted from 15 November 2008 to 31 July 2009 - near the period of the recent solar minimum activity.

30|$|Following the {{recommendations}} of Publication 103 of the ICRP [14], these <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> were then sex-averaged and the effective dose was evaluated using the tissue weighting factors of Publication 60 of the ICRP [15].

40|$|Radioembolisation (RE), with yttrium- 90 (90 Y) {{labelled}} microspheres, is {{an increasingly}} common treatment method for unresectable liver tumours. The tolerable mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> for normal liver (NL) tissue {{is higher in}} RE than in External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT); <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> heterogeneity {{is thought to be}} one important reason, together with a low <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> rate, but the knowledge of microsphere distributions is limited. The aim of this thesis was to describe macroscopic and small-scale heterogeneity in the distribution of microspheres and consequently in <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> and to create a hepatic branching artery tree model, able to reproduce normal liver microsphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distributions. Another aim was to develop and evaluate a method for prediction of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the surgeon’s hands during liver resection on still radioactive tissues. Two patients with marginally resectable cholangiocarcinoma underwent resection, nine days after RE with resin SIR-Spheres®. Considering radiation safety, simulation of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to surgeon’s hands was performed with the software Varskin Mod 2 ® before surgery and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> rate measurements were done with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) on resected tissue. The macroscopic sphere distribution within NL was investigated by gamma well chamber activity measurements on punch biopsies from sliced resected tissues and by calculating coefficient of variation (CV) and skewness (SK), in relation to biopsy mass. Small-scale heterogeneity in microsphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution was studied by light microscopy and subsequent <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> simulations by beta dose point kernel convolution. A branching artery tree model was used, to simulate microsphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distributions. Tissue measurements and simulations of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to surgeon’s hands showed similar results. The CV and SK of activity concentration, by gamma well chamber measurements, decreased rapidly with increasing mass and/or mean activity concentration. Aggregations of clusters increased in frequency and CV and SK for <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution increased with mean sphere concentration. The branching artery tree model was able to resemble the biopsy sphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distributions. Expected <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the surgeon’s hands was not alarming, but simulations and measurements of surgeon finger <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> are recommended. Decreasing CV and SK for macroscopic distribution indicated a heterogeneous pattern larger than the punch biopsy masses investigated. Small-scale sphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> heterogeneity both increased with mean sphere concentration. The branching artery tree model helps to explain the distribution mechanism better than previous distribution models. The shown heterogeneity and the arterial tree model provide knowledge that may be helpful in optimising RE treatment, regarding number of injected spheres and activity per sphere...|$|R

40|$|A method using {{dose rate}} {{constant}} and anisotropy function for calculating <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution in brachytherapy has been recommended by AAPM Report no. 51. In 2003, the radiation treatment planning equipment with the method for obtaining the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution in brachytherapy using Cs- 137 needles was introduced into Department of Radiology, Nagoya University Hospital. The method beforehand requires radial dose functions g(r) and anisotropy functions F(r, θ).

In order to verify the accuracy of this method, we compared the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution obtained with this method and that obtained with EGS 4 Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, we examined the influence of the geometry of the needle source to the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution.

30|$|The {{adaption}} ratio (simulated/measured mean dose) {{was almost}} perfect for individual biopsies, on average 0.99 [*]±[*] 0.025. When comparing the mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> {{distribution of the}} sub-sample of 16 biopsies (measured activity) with the 41 biopsies (measured activity), {{it is obvious that}} the former is not a representative sample, regarding macroscopic distribution (mean: 38 [*]±[*] 21 vs. 47 [*]±[*] 34 Gy, median 36 vs. 38 Gy), thus with an overall adaption ratio (sub-sample/sample mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose)</b> of only 0.81. By weighting the macroscopic influence of the 16 biopsies, the adaption of the mean is better (mean: 43 [*]±[*] 38 vs. 47 [*]±[*] 34 Gy, median: 36 vs. 38 Gy), with an overall adaption ratio (weighted-sub-sample/sample mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose)</b> of 0.91, but it is still far from perfect. The reason for this is that the regions with the highest mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> were not included in the microscopic sample, as cluster tracking through sequential sections was complicated for biopsies with a high concentration of microspheres. Therefore, the biopsy with the highest mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> (i.e., 84 Gy) was used to represent the macroscopic dose distribution > 67 Gy. Including biopsies with mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> > 84 Gy would most certainly extend the “tail” in the high <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> spectrum and slightly increase the proportion of <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> > 100 Gy. However, this would not have a large impact on the distribution in the lower part of the spectrum, which is the most critical for the risk of adverse effects and overall survival of the liver following SIRT. We expect that even larger clusters would contain a major proportion of the activity in biopsies with a higher mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> and, therefore, an even stronger <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> gradient in such sub-regions.|$|R
30|$|A closer {{examination}} of the dose-response relationships for transcripts regulated at all doses in a certain tissue type showed that few transcripts could potentially serve as biomarkers for the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> in the dose interval studied, i.e., showing a monotone increase or decrease in expression with the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose.</b> The majority of the affected transcripts showed little or {{no difference in the}} response between the different <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> levels. In the lung, a high percentage of the regulated transcripts showed a negative regulation at the lowest <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> level and a positive regulation at the two higher <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> levels. Transcripts associated with the Cyp 2 a 5, Mb, Sln, Scgb 3 a 1, and Plunc genes in the lungs and the Clec 2 d, Wsb 1, Mup 4, Acaa 2, and Mpo genes in the liver showed a monotone increase or decrease in expression with the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose.</b> An example of more extreme modulation between dose levels was demonstrated by the Nppa gene, which showed a negative regulation at the lowest dose level that transitioned to a positive regulation with a power of 3 and 20 at 130 and 260 kBq, respectively. An example of a weak regulation at the two lower <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> levels followed by a strong regulation at the highest dose level was demonstrated by the Asprv 1 gene (1.6, 2.1, and 17 at 13, 130, and 260 kBq, respectively). In the spleen, the reverse relationship could be seen where Cfd showed a nine-fold decrease in expression at the lowest <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> level followed by an increase to about a two-fold decrease at the two higher <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> levels. Whether these or other transcripts investigated could potentially prove to be good biomarkers for <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> is still to be determined, and more studies are needed with a larger interval of <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses,</b> together with analyses using QPCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot to study the impact at the protein level.|$|R

However, on average, <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to the tumor insert {{have been found to be}} consistent to within 9 %, except for dose calculations performed on day 1, where the standard deviation over the average <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> values is 20 %.|$|R
