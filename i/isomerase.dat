5|$|These {{mechanisms}} can {{be divided}} into single-substrate and multiple-substrate mechanisms. Kinetic studies on enzymes that only bind one substrate, such as triosephosphate <b>isomerase,</b> aim to measure the affinity with which the enzyme binds this substrate and the turnover rate. Some other examples of enzymes are phosphofructokinase and hexokinase, both of which are important for cellular respiration (glycolysis).|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} natural {{polyisoprene}} content (1.1–7.7% by dry weight of fruit bodies), L.volemus fruit bodies {{can also be}} used to produce rubber. The chemical structure of rubber from the mushroom consists of a high molecular mass homologue of polyprenol, arranged as a dimethylallyl group, two trans isoprene units, a long sequence of cis isoprenes (between 260–300 units), terminated by a hydroxyl or fatty acid ester. Biosynthetically, the creation of the polyisoprene begins with the compound trans,trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate, and is thought to terminate by esterification of polyisoprenyl pyrophosphate. The enzyme isopentenyl-diphosphate delta <b>isomerase</b> has been identified as required for the initiation of rubber synthesis in L.volemus and several other milk cap species.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficiency}} of an enzyme {{can be expressed}} in terms of kcat/Km. This is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the rate constants for all steps in the reaction up to and including the first irreversible step. Because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 108 to 109 (M−1 s−1). At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. Enzymes with this property are called catalytically perfect or kinetically perfect. Example of such enzymes are triose-phosphate <b>isomerase,</b> carbonic anhydrase, acetylcholinesterase, catalase, fumarase, β-lactamase, and superoxide dismutase. The turnover of such enzymes can reach several million reactions per second.|$|E

40|$|In Escherichia coli, FkpA, PpiA, PpiD, and SurA are {{the four}} known periplasmic cis-trans prolyl <b>isomerases.</b> These <b>isomerases</b> {{facilitate}} proper protein folding {{by increasing the}} rate of transition of proline residues between the cis and trans states.

25|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum serves many general functions, including the folding of protein molecules in sacs called cisternae and {{the transport of}} synthesized proteins in vesicles to the Golgi apparatus. Correct folding of newly made proteins is made possible by several {{endoplasmic reticulum}} chaperone proteins, including protein disulfide <b>isomerase</b> (PDI), ERp29, the Hsp70 family member BiP/Grp78, calnexin, calreticulin, and the peptidylpropyl <b>isomerase</b> family. Only properly folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus – unfolded proteins cause an unfolded protein response as a stress response in the ER. Disturbances in redox regulation, calcium regulation, glucose deprivation, and viral infection or the over-expression of proteins can lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ER stress), a state in which the folding of proteins slows, leading {{to an increase in}} unfolded proteins. This stress is emerging as a potential cause of damage in hypoxia/ischemia, insulin resistance, and other disorders.|$|E
40|$|D-Xylose <b>isomerases</b> from {{different}} bacterial strains were chemically modified with histidine and carboxylate-specific reagents. The active-site residues {{were identified by}} amino acid sequence analysis of peptides recognized by differential peptide mapping on ligand-protected and unprotected derivatized enzyme.

These {{results are consistent with}} the recently published X-ray data of the enzyme active centre from Streptomyces rubiginosus showing hydrogen bond formation between Asp- 57 and His- 54 which locks the latter in one tautomeric form.

25|$|The {{glycerol}} {{released by}} lipase action is phosphorylated by glycerol kinase {{in the liver}} (the only tissue in which this reaction can occur), and the resulting glycerol 3-phosphate is oxidized to dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

25|$|There is {{no known}} cure, but an {{appropriate}} diet and the enzyme xylose <b>isomerase</b> can help. The ingestion of glucose simultaneously with fructose improves fructose absorption and may prevent {{the development of}} symptoms.

40|$|Background: Thiol <b>isomerases</b> are {{a family}} of {{endoplasmic}} reticulum enzymes which orchestrate redox-based modifications of protein disulphide bonds. Previous studies have identified important roles for the thiol <b>isomerases</b> PDI and ERp 5 in the regulation of normal platelet function. Objectives: Recently, we demonstrated {{the presence of a}} further five thiol <b>isomerases</b> at the platelet surface. In this report we aim to report the role of one of these enzymes - ERp 57 in the regulation of platelet function. Methods/Results: Using enzyme activity function blocking antibodies, we demonstrate a role for ERp 57 in platelet aggregation, dense granule secretion, fibrinogen binding, calcium mobilisation and thrombus formation under arterial conditions. In addition to the effects of ERp 57 on isolated platelets, we observe the presence of ERp 57 in the developing thrombus in vivo. Furthermore the inhibition of ERp 57 function was found to reduce laser-injury induced arterial thrombus formation in a murine model of thrombosis. Conclusions: These data suggest that ERp 57 is important for normal platelet function and opens up the possibility that the regulation of platelet function by a range of cell surface thiol <b>isomerases</b> may represent a broad paradigm for the regulation of haemostasis and thrombosis...|$|R

25|$|In one paper, Meyerhof and {{scientist}} Renate Junowicz-Kockolaty {{investigated the}} reaction that splits fructose 1,6-diphosohate into the two triose phosphates. Previous work {{proposed that the}} split occurred via 1,3-diphosphoglyceraldehye plus an oxidizing enzyme and cozymase. Meyerhoff and Junowicz found that the equilibrium constant for the <b>isomerase</b> and aldoses reaction were not affected by inorganic phosphates or any other cozymase or oxidizing enzymes. They further removed diphosphoglyceraldehyde as a possible intermediate in glycolysis.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, PLCs share a conserved core {{structure}} and differ in other domains specific for each family. The core enzyme includes a split triosephosphate <b>isomerase</b> (TIM) barrel, pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, four tandem EF hand domains, and a C2 domain. The TIM barrel contains the active site, all catalytic residues, and a Ca2+ binding site. It has an autoinhibitory insert that interrupts its activity called an X-Y linker. The X-Y linker {{has been shown}} to occlude the active site, and with its removal PLC is activated.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatories, {{regardless}} of the inflammation's cause; their primary anti-inflammatory mechanism is lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis. Lipocortin-1 both suppresses phospholipase A2, thereby blocking eicosanoid production, and inhibits various leukocyte inflammatory events (epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst, etc.). In other words, glucocorticoids not only suppress immune response, but also inhibit the two main products of inflammation, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. They inhibit prostaglandin synthesis {{at the level of}} phospholipase A2 {{as well as at the}} level of cyclooxygenase/PGE <b>isomerase</b> (COX-1 and COX-2), the latter effect being much like that of NSAIDs, potentiating the anti-inflammatory effect.|$|E

25|$|Unlike many {{viruses that}} enter the cell through endocytosis, polyomaviruses {{penetrate}} the cell membrane {{and enter the}} cytosol from the late endoplasmic reticulum rather than from endosomes, although conformational changes in response to low pH in endolysosomes have been hypothesized as critical steps in the process. MPyV membrane exit is believed {{to depend on the}} presence of specific host proteins located in the late ER; for example, the host protein ERp29, a member of the protein disulfide <b>isomerase</b> family, has been shown to disrupt the conformation of VP1. It is not known whether entry into the cytosol is obligatory for MPyV infection or whether the particle could enter the cell nucleus directly from the ER. Even a single viral particle entering the nucleus can be sufficient for infection.|$|E
25|$|For the cholera toxin, the {{principal}} glycolipid receptor for the cholera toxin is ganglioside GM1. After endocytosis to the golgi apparatus, the toxin is redirected to the endoplasmic reticulum. In {{order for the}} A subunit to reach its target, a disulfide bond between the A1 and A2 domain must be broken. This breakage is catalyzed by a protein disulfide <b>isomerase</b> {{that is in the}} endoplasmic reticulum. Following separation, the A1 domain unfolds and is redirected back to the cytosol where it refolds and catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of certain G protein alpha subunits. In doing so, the downstream effects of the G protein signal transduction pathway is disrupted by activating adenylate cyclase. This causes a higher concentration of cAMP in the cell, which disrupts the regulation of ion transport mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|More specifically, the {{biosynthesis}} of (−)-menthol {{takes place}} in the secretory gland cells of the peppermint plant. Geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS), first catalyzes the reaction of IPP and DMAPP into geranyl diphosphate.

(−)-Limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3OH), using O2 and NADPH, then catalyzes the allylic hydroxylation of (−)-limonene at the 3 position to (−)-trans-isopiperitenol. (−)-Trans-isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (iPD) further oxidizes the hydroxy group on the 3 position using NAD+ to make (−)-isopiperitenone. (−)-Isopiperitenone reductase (iPR) then reduces the double bond between carbons 1 and 2 using NADPH to form (+)-cis-isopulegone. (+)-Cis-isopulegone <b>isomerase</b> (iPI) then isomerizes the remaining double bond to form (+)-pulegone. (+)-Pulegone reductase (PR) then reduces this double bond using NADPH to form (−)-menthone. (−)-Menthone reductase (MR) then reduces the carbonyl group using NADPH to form (−)-menthol.|$|E
