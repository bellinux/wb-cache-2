40|$|T- 2 toxin is a toxic and {{teratogenic}} mycotoxin {{produced by}} Fusarium tricintum which may contaminate cereal, seed, and food. The {{aim of this}} research is to find out the effects of T- 2 Toxin on preimplantion embryos and fetuses of Swiss Webster mice. Pregnant female of Swiss Webster mice on 0 or 2 day of gestation was injected intraperitoneally with T- 2 toxin at doses 0. 05 or 0. 10 mg/kg body weight (bw) and the dam was observed at 3. 5 and 18 days of gestation. At 0 day of gestation, embryos were arrested at one to eight cell and uncompacted morulae stages (P < 0. 01) compared to control, in both 0. 05 and 0. 10 mg/kg bw doses. The cell numbers of late blastocyst at all treated groups were decreased significantly compared to control. At 2 day of gestation, most of embryos were arrested on compacted morulae stage at dose 0. 10 mg/kg bw (P < 0. 01), the late blastocyst and its cell number were dose-dependently decreased. The live fetuses decreased significantly at all dose of T- 2 toxin. No external malformation occurred in the fetuses. Results showed that T- 2 toxin given at preimplantation stages inhibited development of preimplantation embryos as indicated by decreased number of live fetuses. Therefore, it was grouped as <b>embryotoxic</b> <b>agent</b> but those dosages did not cause malformation of the external appearance of Swiss Webster mice fetuses...|$|E
40|$|Inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm cell {{lineages}} diverge {{early in}} cleavage {{in response to}} a complex combination of cellular and molecular determinative events. The resulting differences in metabolic requirements, cell positioning and micro-environments are considered as some of the major causes underlying the differential sensitivity of ICM and trophectoderm cell lines to <b>embryotoxic</b> <b>agents.</b> In most instances, ICM cells appear less resistant to disruption than trophectoderm cells, and past observations suggest that over-stimulation of apoptosis {{is probably one of the}} mechanisms leading to selective ICM depletion at the blastocyst stage. Disproportionate deficiency in this lineage below a certain threshold level may then prevent the ICM core from providing sufficient prefetal stem cells during gastrulation and from sending regulatory signals to the trophectoderm, leading to compromised post-implantation development. The aim of this review article is to discuss the above observations and to show the value of the impact of hyperglycaemia on blastocyst metabolism and development as an exciting model for further studies...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of their recent studies, several {{researchers}} have suggested that the infertility associated with mild endometriosis is due to the alteration of peritoneal fluid, resulting in impairment of the viability of gametes or embryos. Elevated numbers of macrophages and lymphocytes {{have been reported in the}} peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis. Interleukin- 1 (IL-I) a major product of activated macrophages and Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), a product of most activated T-cells, have been postulated to play a role in the infertility associated with this disease, possibly by acting as direct <b>embryotoxic</b> <b>agents.</b> We have exwnined the effect of purified recombinant IL-I and IL- 2, which are not species-specific, on in vitro development of mouse embryos. Both interleukins had no effect on development to the blastocyst stage or on early stages of implantation, as measured in vitro by attachment and outgrowth of blastocysts to fibronectin-coated dishes. Moreover, co-culture of mouse embryos with activated human peritoneal macrophages had no effect on embryogenesis. We conclude that neither IL-I, nor other products of human macrophages activated by lipopolysaccharide, nor IL- 2 are directly toxic to early mouse embryonic development...|$|R
40|$|Several <b>embryotoxic</b> <b>agents,</b> which {{includes}} sodium salicylate, {{were reported to}} induce vertebral variations {{in the form of}} supernumerary ribs (SNR) when administered to pregnant rodents. Because the biological significance of SNR in toxicological studies is still a matter of debate, we investigated the molecular basis of this defect by analyzing the possible involvement of Hox genes, known to specify vertebrae identity. Sodium salicylate (300 mg/kg) was administered to pregnant rats on gestational day 9 (GD 9). On GD 13, the expression of several Hox genes, selected according to the position of their anterior limit of expression, namely upstream (Hoxa 9), at the level (Hoxa 10) and downstream (Hoxd 9) to the morphological alteration, were analyzed. Posterior shifts in the anterior limit of expression of Hoxa 10 and Hoxd 9 were observed following exposure to salicylate, which could explain an effect {{at the level of the}} axial skeleton. This finding suggests that the appearance of ectopic ribs can be attributed to an anterior transformation of lumbar vertebrae identity into thoracic vertebrae identity. Whether this transformation occurs with all compounds inducing SNR in rats remains to be determined...|$|R
40|$|Many {{industrial}} chemicals {{and their respective}} by-products need to be comprehensively evaluated for toxicity using reliable and efficient assays. In terms of teratogenicity evaluations, the murine-based embryonic stem cell test (EST) offers a promising solution to screen for multiple tissue endpoints. However, use of a mouse model in the EST can yield only a limited understanding of human development, anatomy, and physiology. Non-human primate or human in vitro models have been suggested to be a pharmacologically and pathophysiologically desirable alternative to murine in vitro models. Here, we comparatively evaluated the sensitivity of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) of a non-human primate to skeletal teratogens with mouse ESCs hypothesizing that inclusion of non-human primate cells in in vitro tests would increase the reliability of safety predictions for humans. First, osteogenic capacity was compared between ESCs from the mouse and a New World monkey, the common marmoset. Then, cells were treated with compounds that have been previously reported to induce bone teratogenicity. Calcification and MTT assays evaluated effects on osteogenesis and cell viability, respectively. Our data indicated that marmoset ESCs responded differently than mouse ESCs in such embryotoxicity screens with no obvious dependency on chemical or compound classes and thus suggest that embryotoxicity screening results could be affected by species-driven response variation. In addition, ESCs derived from rhesus monkey, an Old World monkey, and phylogenetically closer to humans than the marmoset, were observed to respond differently to test compounds than marmoset ESCs. Together {{these results indicate that}} there are significant differences in the responses of non-human primate and mouse ESC to <b>embryotoxic</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Biochemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. L- 2, 4 -Diaminobutyric acid (DABA) is a non-protein {{amino acid}} and {{constituent}} of numerous plants (i. e. Lathyrus species) and microorganisms. This relatively abundant amino acid is a known neurotoxin, neurolathyrogen and urea cycle inhibitor and commonly {{occurs in the}} food chain of vulnerable populations in the rural regions of Africa (i. e. Ethiopia, South Africa) and India. In {{spite of the fact}} that DABA is a well-studied toxic agent, it has not yet been reported to be associated with birth defects in man or domestic animals. DABA is a structural homologue of L-ornithine (Orn) and it was subsequently proposed that this potential Orn anti-metabolite may be teratogenic by acting as an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and subsequently by modulating polyamine concentrations in experimentally exposed pregnant female mice. The objectives of this investigation were to investigate the purported teratogenic properties of DABA in a murine NTD model, to establish the effect of DABA on hepatic and whole embryo ornithine ODC and to broadly investigate its effect on the general metabolism of pregnant female mice and their embryos. Pregnant Hanover. NMRI female mice were dosed (per os) with DABA (total dose: 450 - 1350 mg/kg body mass) on gestation days 7, 8, and 9. Controls animals received a saline solution. The females were kept in metabolic cages - 24 -hour urine samples were collected (gestation day 10) and stored (- 70 °C). Following decapitation of the pregnant females on (gestation day 18), their livers and embryos were harvested and the livers immediately frozen in at - 70 °C. The harvested embryos were stereo-microscopically examined to assess the occurrence, incidence and nature of congenital defects and then stored at - 70 °C. DABA proved to be highly toxic to mouse foetuses at all administered dose levels and foetal mortality was extremely high. A relatively high proportion of foetuses displayed growth retardation and congenital defects. Neural tube defects (i. e. exencephali) occurred in 5 - 17 % of DABA-exposed foetuses. These results corroborate the notion that DABA is an <b>embryotoxic</b> and teratogenic <b>agent.</b> Urinary organic acids, acylcarnitines and amino acids were quantified using GC-MS, ES-MS-MS and the Phenomenex EZ:faast® GC-MS procedures respectively. The detrimental effects of DABA on the metabolism of female Hanover. RPMI mice were obvious from the complexity of and profound changes in the urinary metabolic profiles of DABA-treated females, relative to those obtained for control animals. DABA had clearly left an enormous, but non-specific footprint on the general biochemistry of DABA-treated females and a variety of crucial metabolic processes (glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, urea cycle, etc.) were adversely affected. Enzyme assays were developed and optimised to assess the catalytic activity of ODC in hepatic and whole embryo cytosols and to quantify the total polyamine concentration in tissue (liver, embryo) and urine samples. The catalytic activity of ODC in maternal livers and whole embryos, harvested from DABA-treated pregnant females, were significantly inhibited (- 53 %; p< 0. 0001). Total polyamine concentrations in the liver and whole embryo cytosols and maternal urine samples were similarly depressed (- 70 %; p< 0. 05). These results unambiguously demonstrated that DABA can act as an Orn anti-metabolite, inhibit the ODC-catalyzed production of Put from Orn and depress the biosynthesis of polyamines (Put, Spd, Spm). The relatively low levels of polyamines during the critical stages of neural tube closure may have adversely affected polyamine-directed regulation of the cell cycle, subsequently causing the dysmorphogenesis (i. e. NTD) observed in some of the embryos of DABA-treated pregnant female mice. Master...|$|R
