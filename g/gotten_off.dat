5|$|En {{route to}} Isabella, Clear {{and the other}} realize {{that all of them}} are still alive due to the Flight 180 {{survivors}} having <b>gotten</b> <b>off</b> the plane. While driving to the hospital, they are involved in a car accident that leaves Eugene needing medical help and eventually leads to the deaths of Kat and Rory. Following their deaths, Clear, Kimberly and Thomas go to the hospital to save Isabella. While they do succeed in finding her in time and ensuring her infant survives, Kimberly has another premonition that reveals to her Isabella was never meant to die in the pileup, meaning they're still in danger. Understanding the situation, Clear tries to find Eugene's room. Finding him contained by an oxygenated room, she opens the door, subsequently loosening the plug of Eugene's defibrillator, creating a spark that incinerates Eugene's room, burning her and Eugene.|$|E

25|$|The Glamorgan reply {{could not}} have <b>gotten</b> <b>off</b> to a worse start, losing opener Richard Grant very first ball. David Hemp soon followed, {{becoming}} Plunkett's second victim, with only seven runs on the board. Glamorgan were always struggling with the run-rate, {{with most of the}} top-order recording strike rates of below 100. Only four players made it to double figures, with Jamie Dalrymple top scoring with 32, and had stern support from wicket-keeper Mark Wallace, who fired 26 off sixteen deliveries. However, Glamorgan fell a long way short with Plunkett, the pick of the Durham attack, taking 3-16 off three overs.|$|E
25|$|For most of {{her time}} with Napoleon, Inconstant was under the command of Lieutenant François-Louis Taillade. She transported Napoleon and 40 troops for the re-occupation and {{fortification}} of the islands of Pianosa and Palmaiola. In addition to transporting passengers and mail between Elba and Italy, with her crew augmented by 50 soldiers, she cruised against Barbery pirates. On 6 January 1815 a gale drove Inconstant on shore. She was <b>gotten</b> <b>off,</b> with much difficulty five days later, only to have another storm again drive her ashore, this time causing even more damage. Napoleon temporarily relieved Taillade of command, replacing him with a man named Jean François Chautard. Taillade returned to (shared) command in time for Napoleon's departure from Elba.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 29 September 1803, Jackall sighted and chased a sloop running along the shore between Nieuport and Dunkirk. The wind fell so Leaver sent 11 men in a boat to board the quarry. As the British approached, the sloop ran ashore near three field pieces and a small battery of two guns, and her crew of 10 or 12 men escaped on shore. Jackall, which had been using her sweeps, and {{with the assistance of}} a light breeze that had arisen, came up and provided support for the boat and the sloop, which the boarding party had <b>gotten</b> <b>off.</b> The sloop turned out to be from Dunkirk, armed with four 2-pounder guns, and possibly serving to transport troops. Despite the fire from the sloop before she grounded, and the guns on shore, which were within 25 yards of the sloop, the British sustained no casualties. The sloop turned out to be San Façon.|$|E

25|$|She {{was lost}} off Mangalore on 26 November 1780. The British were {{at war with}} Hyder Ali, Sultan of Mysore, and Vernon wanted to destroy Hyder Ali's small navy. When the {{squadron}} arrived off Callicut Road on 24 November a distant, ineffective engagement ensued. Although the British captured one of Hyder Ali's vessels, the remainder were anchored close to shore. Vernon ordered Simonton to lighten Sartine and move her closer. Simonton, noting that Sartine was already in only three fathoms, was not enthused, but followed orders and by the afternoon she was anchored in shallow water. However, it then became apparent that she was aground. By {{the afternoon of the}} next day she was <b>gotten</b> <b>off</b> after her crew threw some of her guns overboard. When she anchored in deeper water it was found that she was taking on water. Efforts were made on the 26th to stop the leaks, but they were futile. She flooded and was irrecoverable. Some of her sails, masts, and stores were rescued. The subsequent court martial absolved Simonton of all blame.|$|E

[...] The commission had <b>gotten</b> <b>off</b> {{to a slow start}} earlier that year due to problems with vacancies; Lafount was slotted for the Fifth Zone of the new entity, to replace original commissioner John F. Dillon, who had died shortly after taking that position. [...] News of the appointment came as a surprise to {{the other members of the}} commission, since Lafount had little presence in the radio industry.|$|E

500|$|Intelligence {{gained from}} solving {{high-level}} German ciphers—intelligence codenamed Ultra by the British and Americans—came chiefly from Enigma decrypts. While the exact contribution of Ultra intelligence to Allied victory is disputed, Kozaczuk and Straszak note that [...] "it {{is widely believed}} that Ultra saved the world {{at least two years}} of war and possibly prevented Hitler from winning." [...] The English historian Sir Harry Hinsley, who worked at Bletchley Park, similarly assessed it as having [...] "shortened the war by not less than two years and probably by four years". [...] The availability of Ultra was due to the earlier Polish breaking of Enigma; Gordon Welchman, head of Bletchley Park's Hut 6 (which solved German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers), writes: [...] "Hut 6 Ultra would never have <b>gotten</b> <b>off</b> the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military version of the commercial Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use." ...|$|E
