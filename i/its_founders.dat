5|$|As well {{as being}} one of <b>its</b> <b>founders,</b> Francis Joseph Campbell served as RNC's first principal, from 1871 until his {{retirement}} in 1912. He was knighted as a Knight Bachelor by King Edward VII in 1909, for his services to blind people. He was succeeded by his son, Guy Marshall Campbell, and following his death in 1929 Guy's widow, Louie Bealby Campbell took over the position. The role of principal passed outside the Campbell family for the first time upon Louie Bealby Campbell's retirement in 1934.|$|E

5|$|Krugers is {{recorded}} {{as having been}} active in film in the mid-1920s, leading the laboratory at N.V. Java Film. He {{may have been one}} of <b>its</b> <b>founders,</b> together with the Dutchman L.Heuveldorp. The company exclusively produced documentaries until 1926, when Heuveldorp directed the colony's first feature film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng. Krugers served as a cameraman for the film, which was based on a Sundanese folktale, also processing the film in his laboratory in Bandung.|$|E
5|$|Several burials (presumably of {{high-ranking}} benefactors and clergy) {{were made}} within the priory and 19th-century archaeologists found stone coffins during excavations. They are visible against the east wall, but their original location was not recorded. Two centrally placed grave slabs are visible below the east window. The priory once housed the Brus cenotaph, {{a memorial to}} <b>its</b> <b>founders</b> erected in 1521. It was removed in 1540 and dismantled. Most of its parts were recovered and reassembled in the 19th century, and the reconstructed cenotaph is displayed in Saint Nicholas' Church next to the ruins.|$|E
5|$|The {{founder effect}} is a special case of a {{population}} bottleneck, occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The random sample of alleles in the just formed new colony is expected to grossly misrepresent the original population {{in at least some}} respects. It is even possible that the number of alleles for some genes in the original population is larger than the number of gene copies in the founders, making complete representation impossible. When a newly formed colony is small, <b>its</b> <b>founders</b> can strongly affect the population's genetic make-up far into the future.|$|E

5|$|After {{breaking}} from Gardner's Bricket Wood coven, Valiente formed her own coven with Grove as High Priest, {{still following}} {{the tradition of}} Gardnerian Wicca, albeit without the Wiccan laws, which she believed to be entirely an invention of Gardner's. This coven however failed to last, breaking up amid arguments between <b>its</b> <b>founders.</b> In 1956, Valiente, {{along with her husband}} and her mother, moved into a basement flat in Lewes Crescent, Kemptown, in the southern coastal town of Brighton, although in 1968 they moved into a flat nearer to the town centre. She befriended another Kemptown resident, the journalist Leslie Roberts, who shared her interest in the supernatural. He attracted much attention to himself in the local press through his claims that practitioners of black magic were also operating in the area. Valiente remained a good friend to Roberts until his death from heart disease in 1966. She also got back in touch with Gardner, and mended their friendship, remaining on good terms until his death in 1964, when he left her £200 in his will. During the early 1960s she also developed a correspondence with two Gardnerian initiates in Sheffield, Patricia Crowther and her husband Arnold Crowther, finally meeting them when the latter couple visited Brighton in 1965.|$|E
5|$|In late 2013, graphic {{designer}} Darren Wall released an art {{book about the}} history of British developer Sensible Software. Funded through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter and written by games journalist Gary Penn of Zzap!64, Sensible Software 1986–1999 is a 340-page anthology of the company's full catalogue, from its popular 16-bit games (e.g. Sensible Soccer, Cannon Fodder, Wizball) to its lesser-known products and features. It also explains the personalities behind the company, mainly <b>its</b> <b>founders</b> Jon Hare and Chris Yates, through long-form interviews. Hare was elated when Wall originally contacted him about the project, but Yates, who has been estranged from Hare since 2003, did not participate. Hare explained the company's issues with scaling and hiring, and how the company was slow to transition to 3D graphics. Other commentators featured in the book include developer and entrepreneur David Darling, television personality Dominik Diamond, musician Martin Galway, and games journalist Gary Whitta.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{government}} {{divided the}} trans-Allegheny region into several new territories. The largest {{of these was}} the Northwest Territory, which was progressively divided into several smaller territories by the United States Congress. In 1800, the Indiana Territory was the first new territory established from {{a portion of the}} Northwest Territory. The territory grew in population and development until it was admitted to the Union in 1816 as the nineteenth state, Indiana. Following statehood, the newly established state government laid out on an ambitious plan to transform Indiana from a segment of the frontier into a developed, well populated, and thriving state. The state's founders initiated a program that led to the construction of roads, canals, railroads, and state-funded public schools. Despite the noble aims of the project, profligate spending ruined the state's credit. By 1841 the state was near bankruptcy and forced to liquidate most of its public works. By its new constitution of 1851, it restricted rights of free blacks and excluded them from the suffrage. During the 1850s, the state's population grew to exceed one million. The ambitious program of <b>its</b> <b>founders</b> was realized as Indiana became the fourth-largest state in terms of population, as measured by the 1860 census.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{development}} processes of Ultimate Play the Game, which was known for its avoidance of media spotlight. <b>Its</b> <b>founders,</b> brothers Tim and Chris Stamper, were infamously taciturn both to preserve their time and to let their games speak for themselves. Though as the Sabreman series became popular, their silence contributed to the series' mystique. The main criticism of Underwurlde predecessor and the first game in the Sabreman series, Sabre Wulf, was its similarity to an earlier game by the Stamper brothers, as both were depicted in a top-down view as action-adventure games. While Retro Gamer wrote that the sequel, Underwurlde, resolved this criticism by instead using a side view as a platform game, Ultimate Play the Game also had a reputation for releasing games outside the order in which they were developed. Indeed, the Stamper brothers claimed to have finished their third Sabreman title, the epochal Knight Lore, in advance of both of its predecessors. The Stampers primarily developed for the ZX Spectrum home computer and outsourced the work of converting their games to work on other types of computers to external developers more familiar with the hardware architecture of other platforms. For instance, Firebird created the Commodore 64 releases of Sabre Wulf and Underwurlde. The game released alongside Knight Lore for the ZX Spectrum near the 1984 holiday season, and the Commodore 64 version released a year later.|$|E
