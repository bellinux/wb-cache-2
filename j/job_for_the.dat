Johnson ended his first game with Culpepper at quarterback with 2receptions for 92yards in a 3814 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. In Johnson's 4thgame with Culpepper, he had 5catches for 66yards.

5|$|Before the 1988 San Diego Chargers season began, Dan Fouts {{chose to}} retire from the game after 15 seasons, leaving Vlasic as the main backup to starter Mark Herrmann, {{and as a result}} the Chargers began trying to trade for an {{experienced}} quarterback. The Chargers also signed Mark Malone and Babe Laufenberg to compete for the starting job, and traded Herrmann to the Indianapolis Colts. After months of training and the 1988 preseason, Vlasic began the season as the third-string quarterback behind Malone and Laufenberg, who won the starting job. In November, after Laufenberg was injured, the Chargers decided to make Vlasic the starter instead of Malone due to the latter's ineffectiveness, as well as a six-game losing streak. He made his season debut against the Atlanta Falcons on November 13, and threw for 190 yards in a 107 victory. As a result of his performance, coach Al Saunders said that Vlasic would have the starting <b>job</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of the season. Vlasic's second start came against the Los Angeles Rams where he threw for 80 yards and a touchdown. However, he suffered torn ligaments in his left knee late in the third quarter, and was lost for the season. He finished the season with 25 of 52 passes completed and a passer rating of 54.2.|$|E

5|$|Moon {{retained}} {{the starting quarterback}} spot for two seasons, but suffered a broken collarbone halfway through his third season with the Vikings {{and was replaced by}} Brad Johnson {{for the remainder of the}} season. The Vikings had three starting quarterbacks in the following three seasons– Johnson (1997), Randall Cunningham (1998) and Jeff George (1999)– before Daunte Culpepper began a six-year spell in his second year in the NFL in 2000. He suffered a serious knee injury during the 2005 season, and Johnson took over in the position again, having re-signed the previous summer after seven years away from the franchise. Culpepper then joined the Miami Dolphins in 2006, giving Johnson another full year as starting quarterback , only to be replaced by sophomore Tarvaris Jackson in 2007. The 2008 season commenced with Jackson starting at quarterback, but he was replaced after two games by Gus Frerotte, who was returning to the Vikings from the St. Louis Rams after having been traded to the Miami Dolphins in 2005. Jackson regained the <b>job</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final three games and led the Vikings to their first divisional title since 2000, and their first NFC North title.|$|E
