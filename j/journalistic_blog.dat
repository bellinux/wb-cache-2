40|$|It is {{a growing}} {{phenomenon}} that journalists in Zimbabwe are blogging. Some journalists blog within the media outlet’s website, while some blogs in the public sites. This paper mainly discusses the limitation of blogs by analyzing the difference between newspaper blogs and writings on public blog platforms. I argue that the content of public blogs is markedly different from those published on newspaper blogs. This is because newspaper blogs are less individualistic and <b>journalistic</b> <b>blogging</b> on newspaper platforms is more strongly influenced by the organization to which they belong...|$|R

This thesis {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the role that blogs play in contemporary South African journalism through examining six blogs in the South African blogosphere and their content choices. This thesis draws on four key theoretical frameworks around which the research questions have been formulated: New Media and Journalism, <b>Journalistic</b> <b>Blogging,</b> Audiences and the Public Sphere. There are three key research questions: 1. What is {{the role played by}} blogging in contemporary South African journalism? 2. To what extent has the blogosphere become a Public Sphere? 3. How have blogs influenced/changed/impacted on the style and content of South African journalism? The qualitative data collected through blog observation, interviews with blog owner/ editors and concluded focus group discussions with blog readers, is designed to help reveal the role blogs and bloggers play in contemporary South African journalism, and through discussions with the audience and monitoring conversations online, help explore the possibilities of a public sphere. The conclusion of this thesis is that blogs do play a role in contemporary South African journalism and can serve as an effective public sphere. Defining {{what it means to be}} a journalist and recognising the differences between blogger and journalist is an issue that needs to be effectively understood before a conclusive agreement is to be reached in the blogger/journalist debate. However, for now the relationship between South African news agents and South African bloggers is promising...|$|R
40|$|News and blogs are {{two types}} of media that {{generate}} and offer informational resources. News is any information whose revelation is anticipated to have an intellectual or actionable impact on the recipient. The dominant type of news in text analysis is that pertaining to current events. Originally referring to print-based news from press agencies or end-user news providers (like individual newspapers or serials), it now increasingly refers to Web-based news in the online editions of the same providers or in online-only news media. The term is generally understood to denote only the reports in news media, not opinion or comment pieces. A blog is a (more or less) frequently updated publication on the Web, sorted in (usually reverse) chronological order of the constituent blog posts. The content may reflect any interest including personal, <b>journalistic,</b> or corporate. <b>Blogs</b> were originally called weblogs. To avoid confusion with web server log files that are also known by this term, the abbreviation “blog ” was coined and is now commonly used. News and blogs consist of textual and (in some cases) pictorial content, and, when Web-based, may contain additional content in any other format (e. g., video, audio) and hyperlinks. They are indexed by time and structured into smaller units: news media into articles, blogs into blog posts. In most news and blogs, textual content dominates. Therefore, text analysis is the most often applied form o...|$|R
