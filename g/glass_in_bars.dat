50|$|Lobbies {{are often}} filled with ice sculptures, {{and food and}} drinks are {{specially}} chosen for the circumstances. For instance, <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> an ice <b>bar</b> can be made of ice and people sit on benches made of ice. An ice bar, sometimes associated with an ice hotel, is a drinking establishment primarily made of ice.|$|R

Each spring, around March, Icehotel harvests tons of ice from the frozen Torne River and stores it in a nearby {{production}} hall with room for over 900 t of ice and 27000 t of snow. The ice is used for creating Icebar designs and ice glasses, which are used for ice sculpting classes, events and product launches all over the world while the snow is used for building a strong structure for the building. About 900 t of what is left is used {{in the construction of the}} next Icehotel.|$|R

Scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive analysis indicates that the major minerals of the chondrule are olivine, bronzite and chromite, with olivine bars separated by glass of nearly pure plagioclase composition. The olivine is observed to have a composition richer in Fe than that predicted from olivine-liquid equilibria, indicating, along {{with the presence of}} plagioclase glass and small amounts of subcalcic diopside, the nonequilibrium crystallization of the barred olivine chondrule. The textural features of the chondrule are consistent with a liquid origin for nepheline and sodalite from the chondrule-forming liquid under nonequilibrium conditions...|$|R

Mulder finds out through a man named Argyle Saperstein (Art Evans) that Zupanic and one of the women are in a relationship and that Zupanic is a professional wrestler. Scully finds that for the past 12 years the women have followed each other across 17 states and left mayhem in their wake. Saperstein calls Zupanic and it is revealed that Zupanic owes Saperstein money. In addition, Betty and Bert have been in a relationship, but he has been having an affair with Lulu. A second earthquake occurs as Lulu prepares to walk in on Zupanic and Saperstein exchanging money. After Betty emerges from the bathroom, the two see each other and the <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> the building begins breaking.

6000|$|One evening, as {{the usual}} social circle were drawn around Mosby's stove, the lazy silence {{was broken by}} the {{familiar}} sounds of pistol shots {{and a series of}} more familiar shrieks and yells from the rocky hill road. The circle quickly recognized the voices of their old friends the roisterers and gamblers from Sawyer's Dam; they as quickly recognized the returning shouts here and there from a few companions who were welcoming them. I grieve to say that in spite of their previous attitude of reformation a smile of gratified expectancy lit up the faces of the younger members, and even the older ones glanced dubiously at Briggs. Mosby made no attempt to conceal a sigh of relief as he carefully laid out an extra supply of <b>glasses</b> <b>in</b> his <b>bar.</b> Suddenly the oncoming yells ceased, the wild gallop of hoofs slackened into a trot, and finally halted, and even the responsive shouts of the camp stopped also. We all looked vacantly at each other; Mosby leaped over his counter and went to the door; Briggs followed with the rest of us. The night was dark, and it was a few minutes before we could distinguish a straggling, vague, but silent procession moving through the moist, heavy air on the hill. But, to our surprise, it was moving away from us--absolutely LEAVING the camp! We were still staring in expectancy when out of the darkness slowly emerged a figure which we recognized at once as Captain Jim, one of the most reckless members of our camp. Pushing us back into the grocery he entered without a word, closed the door behind him, and threw himself vacantly into a chair. We at once pressed around him. He looked up at us dazedly, drew a long breath, and said slowly: ...|$|R

6000|$|They {{found the}} doors of the house {{standing}} open, the <b>bar</b> <b>in</b> some disorder--several bottles of whisky were afterwards found to be missing--and Blake, the village policeman, rapping patiently at the open door. He entered with them. The <b>glass</b> <b>in</b> the <b>bar</b> had suffered severely, and one of the mirrors was starred from a blow from a pewter pot. The till had been forced and ransacked, and so had the bureau in the minute room behind the bar. An upper window was opened and the voice of the landlady became audible making enquiries. They went out and parleyed with her. She had locked herself upstairs with the little girl, she said, and refused to descend until she was assured that neither Uncle Jim nor Mr. Polly's gun were anywhere on the premises. Mr. Blake and Mr. Warspite proceeded to satisfy themselves with regard to the former condition, and Mr. Polly went to his room in search of garments more suited to the brightening dawn. He returned immediately with a request that Mr. Blake and Mr. Warspite would [...] "just come and look." [...] They found the apartment in a state of extraordinary confusion, the bedclothes in a ball in the corner, the drawers all open and ransacked, the chair broken, the lock of the door forced and broken, one door panel slightly scorched and perforated by shot, and the window wide open. None of Mr. Polly's clothes were to be seen, but some garments which had apparently once formed part of a stoker's workaday outfit, two brownish yellow halves of a shirt, and an unsound pair of boots were scattered on the floor. A faint smell of gunpowder still hung in the air, and two or three books Mr. Polly had recently acquired had been shied with some violence under the bed. Mr. Warspite looked at Mr. Blake, and then both men looked at Mr. Polly. [...] "That's his boots," [...] said Mr. Polly.|$|R

The 111 In activity in the eluted fractions was analyzed using a Wallac WIZARD 2 2480 Automatic Gamma Counter (PerkinElmer), by measuring the peak area of the 171 - and 245 -keV photon peaks. The labeling efficiency was determined as the amount of 111 In encapsulated in the micelles relative to the total amount of 111 In added to the sample.|$|R

40|$|In Korea, smoke-free {{regulations}} have been gradually implemented <b>in</b> <b>bars</b> based on venue size. Smoking bans were implemented <b>in</b> 2013 for <b>bars</b> ≥ 150 m 2, <b>in</b> 2014 for <b>bars</b> ≥ 100 m 2, and <b>in</b> 2015 for <b>bars</b> of all sizes. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine indoor fine particle (PM 2. 5) concentrations <b>in</b> <b>bars</b> before and after implementation of the smoke-free policies based on venue size. Indoor PM 2. 5 concentrations were measured with real-time aerosol monitors at four time points: (1) pre-regulation (n = 75); (2) after implementing the ban <b>in</b> <b>bars</b> ≥ 150 m 2 (n = 75); (3) after implementing the ban <b>in</b> <b>bars</b> ≥ 100 m 2 (n = 107); and (4) when all bars were smoke-free (n = 79). Our results showed that the geometric mean of the indoor PM 2. 5 concentrations of all bars decreased from 98. 4 μg/m 3 pre-regulation to 79. 5, 42. 9, and 26. 6 μg/m 3 after the ban on smoking <b>in</b> <b>bars</b> ≥ 150 m 2, ≥ 100 m 2, and all bars, respectively. Indoor PM 2. 5 concentrations <b>in</b> <b>bars</b> of each size decreased only after the corresponding regulations were implemented. Although smoking was not observed <b>in</b> Seoul <b>bars</b> after smoking was banned <b>in</b> all <b>bars,</b> smoking was observed in 4 of 21 <b>bars</b> <b>in</b> Changwon. Our study concludes that the greatest decrease in PM 2. 5 concentrations <b>in</b> <b>bars</b> was observed after the regulation covering all bars was implemented. However, despite the comprehensive ban, smoking was observed <b>in</b> <b>bars</b> <b>in</b> Changwon. Strict compliance with the regulations is needed to improve indoor air quality further...|$|R
