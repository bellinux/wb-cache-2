40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> {{virus is}} an {{exogenous}} retrovirus (Retroviridae, Oncovirinae) that infects lymphocytes of cattle. Infection with <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> virus and the concomitant antibody response are lifelong. Infection {{can result in}} several outcomes, including production of antibodies against <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> virus without other evidence of infection, inversion of the T:B lymphocyte ratio, persistent lymphocytosis, and clinical lymphosarcoma. The prevalence of an infection in a population of animals is {{the proportion of the}} group infected at any given time. Surveys have shown the prevalence of <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> virus infection in cattle populations ranging from 0 to nearly 100 %. This wide range of prevalence levels is likely due to variations in risk factors such as husbandry practices, insect vectors, and genetic resistance. For example, prevalence tends to be higher in dairy than beef cattle and in cattle in Southern vs Northern states. The relative importance of the known modes of transmission of <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> virus has not been established in beef cattle. Also, the economic impact of <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> virus infection in beef cattle has not been examined. However, the presence of cattle infected with <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> virus in a herd drastically reduces opportunities to export cattle and/or semen to many countries. Excluding an early transient viremia, the virus locates in lymphocytes as a DNA provirus. Because of its ceil-associated nature, transmission is believed to occur by movement of infected lymphocytes to susceptible animals. Intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous inoculation of as little as one microliter of blood or intracutaneous inoculation of 2, 500 lymphocytes from an infected animal (equivalent to. 5 microliter of blood) results in transmission of <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> virus. Transmission of an infectious agent in this manner is a form of horizontal transmission. Other means of horizontal transmission have been investigated, including casual contact in common housing; animal husbandry procedures such as dehorning without sanitizing the dehorner between cattle, tattooing with common pliers, rectal palpations with common sleeves, and injections with common needles; and blood feeding arthropods. In addition, transmission from the dam to calf, termed vertical transmission, has also been shown to occur with <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> virus. The purpose of these studies was threefold: 1) to characterize the <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> virus status of the U. S. Meat Animal Research Center cattle population, 2) to investigate the extent and significance of vertical transmission of <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> virus in the U. S.

40|$|Abstract. The {{distribution}} of subpopulations of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and tumors from cattle with <b>enzootic</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>leukosis</b> (EBL) was examined by immunohistochemistry using {{a panel of}} monclonal antibodies against leukocyte differentiation molecules of EBL. The lesions in lymph nodes could be divided into three types based {{on the extent of}} infiltration and proliferation of neoplastic cells with provirus and differential expression of leukocyte differentiation molecules. The number of B-B 2 +, sIgM+ cells was reduced in frequency in follicles during the neoplastic cell proliferation. CD 4 - and CD 8 -positive a/ @ T cells and y/ 6 T cells positive for WC 1 (workshop cluster designation) were also reduced in frequency in areas infiltrated with neoplastic cells. Almost all neoplastic cells were B-B 2 - and IgM-positive. However, there were a few B-B 2 - and/or IgM-negative cells or cells stained faintly in all cases. WCI + cells were not observed in tumor tissues. However, CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells were observed throughout tumor tissues, suggesting a role for these cells in tumor immunity.
