5|$|Contemporary sources {{suggest that}} Morrone was {{hesitant}} {{to accept his}} election when word of the cardinals' decision reached his mountain-top hermitage. His ascetic life left him largely unprepared for the day-to-day responsibilities of the papacy, and he quickly <b>fell</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of the Neapolitan monarchy of Charles of Anjou, to the dissatisfaction of even the pro-Angevin cardinals within the College. Celestine V resigned on 13 December 1294.|$|E

5|$|In 1772, {{then again}} in 1793 and 1795, the two {{dominant}} German states of Prussia and Austria, {{along with the}} Russian Empire, agreed to the Partitions of Poland; dividing among themselves the lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. As {{a result of the}} partitions, millions of Polish speaking inhabitants <b>fell</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> rule of the two German monarchies. However, the annexed territories though incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Realm, were not legally considered {{as a part of the}} Holy Roman Empire. During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, along with the arrival of the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most of the secular Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; German states, particularly the Rhineland states, <b>fell</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of France. Until 1815, France, Russia, Prussia and the Habsburgs competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

His lectures became a medley of religion and politics, punctuated by controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under censure by the French government. The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic teachings, {{and some of his}} works were placed on the Church's list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towiański regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged their followers to do so.|$|E

5|$|Haraldr Guðrøðarson was {{a member}} of the Crovan dynasty, a family of sea-kings who ruled the Mann and parts of the Hebrides from the late {{eleventh}} century to the mid thirteenth century. He was the son of Guðrøðr Rǫgnvaldsson, King of the Isles (died 1231), who was in turn a son of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles (died 1229). Although the latter monarch may have managed to rule a somewhat independent kingdom, surrounded by formidable Norwegian, Scottish, and English monarchs, his successors <b>fell</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> shadow of Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway (died 1263), and rendered tribute to the latter in recognition of Norwegian overlordship.|$|E
5|$|In late June 1942, the Allies {{decided to}} seize {{bases in the}} {{southern}} Solomon Islands {{with the objective of}} denying their use by the Japanese to threaten the supply and communication routes between the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand.

Admiral Nimitz committed much of the Pacific Fleet to the task, including three of his four carrier task forces.

5|$|Jilotepeque Viejo {{was settled}} by the Chajoma {{in order to}} provide a capital that was safer from attack from the hostile Iximche Kaqchikel kingdom than their {{previous}} capital. In spite of this, the city <b>fell</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> domination of Iximche and the city's architecture, spread in a number of fortified groups along a ridge surrounded by deep ravines, shows a mixture of Chajoma and Kaqchikel styles. At the time of the Spanish conquest, the Chajoma of Jilotepeque Viejo may have initially allied themselves with the Spanish together with Iximche and have joined in the general Kaqchikel uprising against the Spanish in 1524. The site was abandoned after the conquest and never reoccupied.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{have lived}} in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000years.

However, the U.S. Army was subsequently commissioned to oversee management of Yellowstone for a 30-year period between 1886 and 1916. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service, which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than a thousand archaeological sites.|$|E
