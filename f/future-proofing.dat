5|$|Bristol {{was ranked}} as Britain's most {{sustainable}} city (based on its environmental performance, quality of life, <b>future-proofing</b> and approaches to climate change, recycling and biodiversity), topping environmental charity Forum for the Future's 2008 Sustainable Cities Index. Local initiatives include Sustrans (creators of the National Cycle Network, founded as Cyclebag in 1977) and Resourcesaver, a non-profit business established in 1988 by Avon Friends of the Earth. In 2014 The Sunday Times named {{it as the}} best city in Britain in which to live. The city received the 2015 European Green Capital Award, becoming the first UK city to receive this award.|$|E

2500|$|... n our fast {{changing}} world where technology is outdated in a blink and <b>future-proofing</b> is the gold standard, the grid has demonstrated remarkable flexibility. Over two hundred years, {{the scale of}} architecture has changed from three-story walk-ups to skyscrapers more than 1,000 feet tall. Parks and avenues unanticipated by the plan have been created. The grid {{gave rise to a}} particular kind of urbanism. Unlike Washington, D.C., and the capital cities of Europe, New York does not have axial avenues that focus on star buildings. New York has buildings that sit cheek by jowl and anonymously form street walls. It has narrow canyons of space bounded by those street walls with views of the horizon. It has density and enclosure but also the thrill of open-ended space. Yet when modernist urban theories turned against the vernacular urbanism of New York, and superblocks and towers in the park were imposed on the city, the grid absorbed those inventions. [...] Although New York's real estate dynamism is typically associated with disrespect for history, with buildings toppled {{for the next generation of}} taller ones, the 1811 grid endures as living history. The plan leaves its imprint on every block, lot, and building in Manhattan, and has provided a remarkably flexible framework for growth and change.|$|E

5000|$|Based on {{the sources}} {{reviewed}} above, {{there are several}} principles of <b>future-proofing</b> that can be determined. <b>Future-proofing</b> means: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Future-proofing</b> is {{the process}} of anticipating the future and {{developing}} methods of minimizing the effects of shocks and stresses of future events. <b>Future-proofing</b> is used in industries such as electronics, medical industry, industrial design, and, more recently, in design for climate change. The principles of <b>future-proofing</b> are extracted from other industries and codified as a system for approaching an intervention in an historic building.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{approach}} to <b>future-proofing</b> suggests that only in more extensive refurbishments to a building should <b>future-proofing</b> be considered. Even then, the proposed time horizon for <b>future-proofing</b> events is 15 to 25 years. The {{explanation for this}} particular time horizon for future-proof improvements is unclear. [...] This author believes that time horizons for <b>future-proofing</b> are much more dependent on the potential service life of the structure, {{the nature of the}} intervention, and several other factors. The result is that time horizons for future-proof interventions could vary from 15 years (rapidly changing technology interventions) to hundreds of years (major structural interventions).|$|E

5000|$|Not promote {{deterioration}} - do no harm. It {{is natural}} for all materials to deteriorate. <b>Future-proof</b> structures and products should not accelerate {{the deterioration of}} existing materials.|$|R
5000|$|Increase {{durability}} and redundancy. <b>Future-proof</b> interventions should use equally durable building materials. Materials that deteriorate {{more quickly than}} the original materials require further interventions and shorten the service life.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Future-proofed</b> format The syntax {{has been}} {{carefully}} {{designed to work}} indefinitely into the future. For example, it allows an arbitrary number of columns, while also allowing arbitrary names of values.|$|R
50|$|<b>Future-proofing</b> of {{designated}} historic structures adds a {{level of}} complexity to the concepts of <b>future-proofing</b> in other industries as described above. All interventions on historic structures must comply with the Secretary’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. The degree of compliance and the Standard selected may vary depending on jurisdiction, type of intervention, significance of the structure, {{and the nature of}} the intended interventions. The underlying principle is that no harm is done to the structure in the course of the intervention which would damage the structure or make it unavailable to future generations. In addition, it is important that the historic portions of the structure be able to be understood and comprehended apart from the newer interventions.|$|E

50|$|In {{one region}} of New Zealand, Hawke’s Bay, a study was {{conducted}} to determine what would be required to future-proof the regional economy with specific reference to the water system. The study specifically sought to understand the existing and potential water demand in the region as well as how this potential demand might change with climate change and more intense land use. This information was used to develop demand estimates that would inform the improvements to the regional water system. <b>Future-proofing</b> thus includes forward planning for future development and increased demands on resources. However, the study focuses on future demands almost exclusively and does not address other components of <b>future-proofing</b> such as contingency plans to handle disastrous damage to the system or durability of the materials in the system.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, hot-water {{central heating}} systems can use water heated in {{or close to}} the {{building}} using high-efficiency condensing boilers, biofuels, or district heating.

50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>future-proofing</b> {{is the process}} of anticipating the future and {{developing}} methods of minimizing the effects of shocks and stresses of future events.

40|$|Homes are renovated {{a number}} of times during their lifespan. Although we can regard each of these renovations as new, it is more prudent to {{implement}} a <b>future-proof</b> solution to renovation. Current renovation practice focuses on renovating to meet current demand. Many of the renovations are still extremely labour intensive and occur on site. This results in solutions to ensure that the house once again meets the required standards in the short term. These standards will continue to change in the future, however. Our homes will continually require renovation. The question is how we can arrive at solutions that do not impede these future renovations, and implement <b>future-proof</b> solutions that can be applied to a large percentage of housing stock. This study defines <b>future-proof</b> renovation as follows: “Future-proof renovation is renovation that at the very least incorporates solutions that do not impede future renovations and preferably increase opportunities for renovation”. The {{purpose of this study is}} to gain an insight into how <b>future-proof</b> renovation solutions are for homes built between 1975 and 1991 that are currently being carried out or offered on the market. The study adopts a primarily architectural viewpoint to examine the hypothesis that we first need to be aware of what is architecturally possible and relevant, before it makes sense to answer any further questions. The key question that this study asks is: What perspective do available renovation concepts offer housing with respect to futureproof renovation? In order to answer this question, this study focuses on developing and applying a method of analysis for these renovation solutions in order to identify the distinctive characteristics that increase the future sustainability of renovation solutions and to evaluate the usability of already developed <b>future-proof</b> renovation solutions for this part of the housing stock. This included seeking inspiration from housing designed using the principles of the Foundation for Architects’ Research (SAR). These homes are constructed according to the support and infill system (SDI homes). This makes it possible to carry out renovations to the infill while the supporting structure remains unchanged. The occupants can then change the infill continually...|$|R
