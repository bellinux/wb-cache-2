5|$|The trivia game begins, {{with various}} {{facts about the}} {{characters}} being revealed such as Joey's space-cowboy imaginary friend (Maurice) and Rachel's actual favorite movie (Weekend at Bernie's). A nine-to-nine score leads to a lightning round. Monica raises the stakes: If the women win, Joey and Chandler must <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> birds, as the maturing Chick is crowing in the mornings and waking them up. Chandler rebuts by suggesting Rachel and Monica <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> apartment to them, which Monica agrees to without consulting Rachel. The girls lose the lightning round because they cannot identify Chandler's job, and the boys win.|$|E

5|$|In 1838, Belcourt {{travelled}} to Rainy Lake {{to examine}} sites for a mission. He abandoned the plan after discovering that the First Nations people {{were unwilling to}} <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> Hudson's Bay Company-supplied liquor, as he required for conversion to Christianity. In August 1838, the priest arranged to have a dictionary published in the Chippewa language, {{and returned to his}} mission at Baie-Saint-Paul. In the winter of 1839, Belcourt carved 280 oak balusters and candlesticks for his log chapel.|$|E
5|$|After {{his success}} at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863, Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley {{to begin his}} second {{invasion}} of the North—the Gettysburg Campaign. With his army in high spirits, Lee intended to shift {{the focus of the}} summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or even Philadelphia. Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit, but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade.|$|E
5|$|After the Taino victory {{the colonists}} formed a citizens' militia to defend {{themselves}} against the attacks. Juan Ponce de León {{and one of his}} top commanders, Diego de Salazar led the Spaniards in a series of offensives which included a massacre of the Taino forces in the domain of Agüeybaná II. The Spanish offensive culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas against Cacique Mabodomoca. Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico. After the failed rebellion, the Tainos were forced to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> customs and traditions by order of a Royal decree, approved by King Ferdinand II, which required that they adopt and practice the values, religion and language of their conquerors.|$|E

5|$|By mid-July Wiesenthal {{and other}} Jewish {{residents}} had to register to do forced labour. Within six months, in November 1941 the Nazis {{had set up}} the Lwów Ghetto using Jewish forced labour. All Jews had to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> homes and move there, a process completed in the following months. Several thousand Jews were murdered in Lvov by Ukrainian nationals and German Einsatzgruppen in June and July 1941. In his autobiographies, Wiesenthal tells how he was arrested on 6 July, but saved from execution by his former foreman, a man named Bodnar, who was {{now a member of}} the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. There are several versions of the story, which may be apocryphal.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at Painless Dentistry, the Simpson {{children}} {{are getting their}} teeth checked. It is discovered Lisa needs braces. When Marge informs Homer, he tells her {{not to worry about}} the cost, as the union had won a dental plan during a previous strike. Later, {{at a meeting of the}} local chapter of International Brotherhood of Jazz Dancers, Pastry Chefs and Nuclear Technicians, Carl announces that the newest contract requires the union to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> dental plan in exchange for a free keg of beer for their meeting. Homer slowly comprehends that giving up their dental plan would require him to pay for Lisa's braces and jumps into action, reminding everyone how their dental plan has helped them all.|$|E
5|$|Nellie Forbush, in {{her journey}} from Little Rock, Arkansas, to {{serving as a}} Navy nurse {{and on to the}} domesticity of the final scene of South Pacific, {{parallels}} the experience of many American women of the period. They entered the workforce during the war, only to find afterwards a societal expectation that they <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> jobs to men, with their best route to financial security being marriage and becoming a housewife. One means of securing audience acceptance of Nellie's choices was the sanitization of her sexual past from her counterpart in the Michener work– that character had a 4-F boyfriend back in Arkansas and a liaison with Bill Harbison while on the island.|$|E

5|$|On April 18, 1989, a {{group of}} 39 women went into the Pittston Coal {{headquarters}} and held a 36‑hour sit-down strike. The women stated {{that they would not}} leave until a contract was signed. When questioned by police and media reporters to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> names, the women responded by saying that they were daughters of Mother Jones. The Daughters gained the attention of the media and completely halted production at Pittston for an entire day and a half. The women involved were not members of the UMWA but wanted to support their cause, and due to this they were linked to the UMWA and considered by some {{to be a part of}} the union.|$|E
5|$|The {{transformation}} of Hungary into a Christian state {{was one of}} Stephen's principal concerns throughout his reign. Although the Hungarians' conversion had already begun in his father's reign, it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> pagan rituals. His legislative activity was closely connected with Christianity. For example, his First Book of Laws from {{the first years of}} his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of feast days and the confession before death. His other laws protected property rights and the interests of widows and orphans, or regulated the status of serfs.|$|E
5|$|Gerard {{also had}} an uneasy {{relationship}} with his cathedral chapter, after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> wives and concubines and become ordained priests. He wrote to Anselm in 1103 complaining of the intransigence of his clergy and envying Anselm's better relations with Canterbury's chapter, which was composed of monks instead of the secular canons who made up York Minster's chapter. In this correspondence, Gerard complained {{that some of the}} York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. He also accused them of accepting prebends but refusing to live or work at the cathedral, and of focusing on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate. The canons' argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses, but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others. It was not only Gerard who complained about the relationship between him and his canons; the latter accused Gerard of impoverishing York by making gifts of lands to others.|$|E

5|$|Romney took a {{hands-on}} {{role in the}} Belmont Stake's matters, helping in domestic maintenance efforts, visiting the sick, and counseling burdened church members. A number of local church members later credited him with turning their lives around or helping them through difficult times. Others, rankled by his leadership style, desired a more consensus-based approach. Romney tried to balance the conservative directives from church leadership in Utah with the desire of some Massachusetts members {{to have a more}} flexible application of religious doctrine. He agreed with some requests from a liberal women's group that published Exponent II calling for changes in the way the church dealt with women, but he clashed with women whom he felt were departing too much from doctrine. In particular, he counseled women not to have abortions except in the rare cases allowed by LDS doctrine and encouraged unmarried women facing unplanned pregnancies to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> babies for adoption. Romney later said that the years spent as an LDS minister gave him direct exposure to people struggling financially and empathy for those with family problems.|$|E
5|$|The rise {{of provincial}} {{men to the}} senatorial and equestrian orders is an aspect of social {{mobility}} {{in the first three}} centuries of the Empire. Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and unlike later European nobility, a Roman family could not maintain its position merely through hereditary succession or having title to lands. Admission to the higher ordines brought distinction and privileges, but also a number of responsibilities. In antiquity, a city depended on its leading citizens to fund public works, events, and services (munera), rather than on tax revenues, which primarily supported the military. Maintaining one's rank required massive personal expenditures. Decurions were so vital for the functioning of cities that in the later Empire, as the ranks of the town councils became depleted, those who had risen to the Senate were encouraged by the central government to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> seats and return to their hometowns, in an effort to sustain civic life.|$|E
5|$|There {{were small}} {{enclaves}} of Mi'kmaq {{in and around}} the coves of Bedford Basin on the Dartmouth shore. Directly opposite to Pier 9 on the Halifax side sat a community in Tufts Cove, also known as Turtle Grove. The settlement, dating back to the 18th century, had been a subject of controversy because white settler landowners wanted to remove the Mi'kmaq residents. In the years and months preceding the explosion, the Department of Indian Affairs had been actively trying to force the Mi'kmaq to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> land, though this had not occurred {{by the time of the}} explosion. The fire aboard Mont-Blanc drew the attention of many onlookers on both sides of the harbour. The physical structures of the settlement were obliterated by the explosion and tsunami. While a precise Mi'kmaq death toll is unknown, records show that nine bodies were recovered, and the settlement was not rebuilt in the wake of the disaster. The Halifax Remembrance Book lists 16 members of the Tufts Cove Community as deceased, although not all the dead listed as in Tufts Cove were Indigenous. Survivors were housed in a racially segregated building under generally poor conditions and eventually dispersed around Nova Scotia.|$|E

5|$|According to the indictment, {{the crime}} {{organization}} headed by Itzhak and Meir Abergil ran a flourishing money-laundering {{business in the}} US from 2002 to 2006, processing {{tens of millions of}} dollars of funds embezzled from the Israel Trade Bank, through the “Jerusalem Gang′s” extortion of Ofer Maximov, that led to his sister Etti Alon′s embezzling 250 million shekel. The money was given out as loans to Israeli businesspeople in the United States, who were later extorted to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> businesses if they did not pay up. Meir Abergil, described as the person in charge of finances, collected the money that was exacted and later laundered and invested it. Gabi Ben Harosh of the “Jerusalem Gang” who was arrested in Los Angeles in 2004, ran the lending bank in the United States and updated Meir and Itzhak Abergil on its balance. Sasson Barashi of Jerusalem and Hai Vaknin of Los Angeles identified borrowers and businesses and also saw to the collection of the money. Yoram Elal, who has fled to Brazil, was responsible for special-operations. The activities have been documented in hundreds of surveillance reports, photographs and phone calls, which were recorded by police departments all over the world and are detailed in the indictment.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the worst, the Romans began a major mobilization, all but {{pulling out}} of {{recently}} pacified Spain and Gaul. They even established a major garrison in Sicily in case the Seleucids ever got to Italy. This fear was shared by Rome's Greek allies, who had largely ignored Rome {{in the years after}} the Second Macedonian War, but now followed Rome again {{for the first time since}} that war. A major Roman-Greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War, Scipio Africanus, and set out for Greece, beginning the Roman-Syrian War. After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses, the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the Battle of Thermopylae (as they believed the 300 Spartans had done centuries earlier). Like the Spartans, the Seleucids lost the battle, and were forced to evacuate Greece. The Romans pursued the Seleucids by crossing the Hellespont, which marked the first time a Roman army had ever entered Asia. The decisive engagement was fought at the Battle of Magnesia, resulting in a complete Roman victory. The Seleucids sued for peace, and Rome forced them to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> recent Greek conquests. Although they still controlled a great deal of territory, this defeat marked the decline of their empire, as they were to begin facing increasingly aggressive subjects in the east (the Parthians) and the west (the Greeks). Their empire disintegrated into a rump over the course of the next century, when it was eclipsed by Pontus. Following Magnesia, Rome again withdrew from Greece, assuming (or hoping) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace. In fact, it did the opposite.|$|E
5|$|Legatine councils in 1125, 1127 and 1129 {{were held}} in Westminster, the last two called by Archbishop William. The council of 1125 met under the {{direction}} of John of Crema and prohibited simony, purchase of the sacraments, and the inheritance of clerical benefices. John of Crema had been sent to England not only to seek a compromise in the Canterbury–York dispute, but to publicize the decrees of the First Council of the Lateran held in 1123, which neither William nor Thurstan had attended. Included in canons were the rejection of hereditary claims to a benefice or prebend, which was a source of consternation to the clergy. Also prohibited was the presence of any women in clergy's households unless they were relatives. In 1127 the council condemned the purchase of benefices, priesthoods, or places in monastic houses. It also enacted canons declaring that clergy who refused to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> wives or concubines would be deprived of their benefices, and that any such women who did not leave the parish where they had been could be expelled and even forced into slavery. Lastly, in 1129 the clergy were once more admonished to live a celibate life and to put aside their wives. This council was presided over by King Henry, who then undermined the force of the prohibition of concubines by permitting the clergy to pay a fine to the royal treasury to keep their women. William's allowance of this royal fine was condemned by the chronicler Henry of Huntingdon. The festival of the Conception was also allowed at one of these councils.|$|E
