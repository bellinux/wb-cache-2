5|$|As {{part of the}} {{settlement}} during the relocation of the London terminus, two new <b>hearse</b> vans {{were given to the}} LNC by the LSWR in 1899. These new <b>hearse</b> vans were longer, and divided into three levels with compartments for eight coffins on each, for a total of 24 coffins per van. These replaced the existing <b>hearse</b> vans and remained in use until the closure of the Necropolis Railway. One of the vans was destroyed in the 1941 bombing of the London terminus; the other was transferred to the SR and remained in use until at least 1950. The former Royal Train brought into passenger service on the London Necropolis Railway in 1939 had a large amount of luggage space, and it is probable that when funeral traffic was light the <b>hearse</b> vans were not used and the coffins carried in the luggage space.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} a Last Ride match between The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy, {{where the only}} way to win was by throwing one's opponent into a <b>hearse</b> and driving it out of the arena. During the beginning of the match, The Undertaker tossed Kennedy into steel steps {{on the side of the}} ring and then onto the commentator's announcing table. The Undertaker then threw Kennedy into the ring apron, which is the apron covering the area under the ring. Kennedy and The Undertaker wrestled inconclusively until The Undertaker tossed Kennedy on top of the roof of the <b>hearse.</b> The Undertaker then delivered a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver, both onto the roof of the <b>hearse.</b> As he was still in control of the match, The Undertaker threw Kennedy into the <b>hearse</b> and drove it out of the arena to win the match.|$|E
5|$|A former <b>hearse</b> {{house at}} the {{southeast}} corner of the churchyard dates from about 1833, and has been converted for use as an electricity sub-station. It is a rectangular single-story building of red sandstone with a quarry tile roof. The door opening at the front has a wide semicircular arch with a keystone and springing blocks, above which is a string course and a cornice with moulded eaves. On the west side and at the rear are small vents with semicircular heads and keystones. The <b>hearse</b> house is listed at GradeII.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hearses</b> were {{originally}} horse-drawn, but silent electric motorized carts were introduced as horses {{began to be}} phased out as transportation. Examples {{that were used in}} Paris were reported in the pages of Scientific American in May 1907 and petrol-driven <b>hearses</b> began to be produced from 1909 in the United States. Motorized <b>hearses</b> became more widely accepted in the 1920s. The vast majority of <b>hearses</b> since then have been based on larger, more powerful car chassis, generally retaining the front end up to and possibly including the front doors but with custom bodywork to the rear to contain the coffin. Some early <b>hearses</b> also served as ambulances, owing to the large cargo capacity {{in the rear of the}} vehicle.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, most <b>hearses</b> {{are based}} on {{commercial}} vans. In the past, all medium-sized vans could be converted into <b>hearses.</b> Today, Mercedes-Benz vans are common in modern fleets. It is common to keep old fleets since they have little wear.|$|R

5|$|On 18September Huskisson's {{body was}} placed in a coffin and covered with black silk. Shortly before midnight a team of men {{prepared}} to move the coffin to a <b>hearse</b> which had been parked outside since the afternoon, but Emily Huskisson refused to allow them to take the body. Instead, she spent another night in the vicarage with the coffin. The next morning she left in a horse-drawn carriage with the windows covered. The coffin, meanwhile, set off in the <b>hearse</b> for Liverpool. Although the funeral party changed horses only at remote and quiet coaching inns to avoid attention, it gathered followers as it progressed; by the time it reached Liverpool Town Hall late that evening, the <b>hearse</b> was followed by at least 10 carriages and more than 500 mourners on foot.|$|E
5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, {{the doors of}} the Capitol were closed to the public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} honor guard entered and carried it down the west steps of the Capitol to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding her hand over her heart, met it. After it was placed in a <b>hearse,</b> the motorcade departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the <b>hearse</b> made its way.|$|E
5|$|Events in {{the capital}} began when Reagan's casket arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. It {{was removed from the}} plane, driven by <b>hearse</b> in a {{procession}} through the Maryland and Virginia suburbs and the nation's capital, across the Memorial Bridge, and onto Constitution Avenue.|$|E

5|$|On June 7, Reagan's {{body was}} removed from the funeral home and driven in a 20-mile-per-hour (32km/h) motorcade, by <b>hearse,</b> to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after its}} {{foundation}} the LNC used existing firms of London undertakers to arrange funerals, {{but over time}} took over {{all aspects of the}} arrangements from coffin-making to masonry. LNC funerals were intentionally kept as similar as possible to those of traditional undertakers, with the exception that a railway carriage was used in place of a <b>hearse.</b> On being commissioned to provide a funeral, invitations would be sent out either by the deceased's family or from the LNC offices. These letters specified the waiting room to be used, the time of the train to Brookwood, and the expected return time to London. If the funeral was to be held in London, a traditional <b>hearse</b> and carriage would take the deceased to their parish church for the service, and then on to the London railway terminus; if the funeral was to take place in the terminus or in Brookwood, the procession would come directly to the terminus.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, Louis Philippe I {{obtained}} {{permission from}} the British to return Napoleon's remains to France. On 15 December 1840, a state funeral was held. The <b>hearse</b> proceeded from the Arc de Triomphe down the Champs-Élysées, across the Place de la Concorde to the Esplanade des Invalides {{and then to the}} cupola in St Jérôme's Chapel, where it remained until the tomb designed by Louis Visconti was completed.|$|E

5|$|Progress M1-5, {{which had}} {{originally}} been built to resupply and refuel either Mir or the International Space Station, was selected to perform the deorbit manoeuvre. Its mission earned it the nickname <b>Hearse.</b> It was a Progress-M1 11F615A55 spacecraft, with the serial number 254. An uninhabited area of the southern Pacific Ocean was selected for the station to be deorbited into, as had been done with five earlier Salyut spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} rivalry {{was between}} The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy. On the September 8, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy {{announced that he}} was looking for a new opponent, one that he had never faced before. Long informed Kennedy that he knew a SmackDown! superstar that had never faced Kennedy, The Undertaker. A match was made between the two for No Mercy, in which Kennedy defeated Undertaker by disqualification. At Survivor Series, Kennedy once again defeated Undertaker in a First Blood match. On the December 1 episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker fought Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a match where neither wrestler won. During the match, MVP was scripted to attempt escaping from the ring, but Kennedy caught him during the process and tried to throw him back into the ring. MVP instead threw Kennedy in. Undertaker then kicked Kennedy in the face, and Kane attacked MVP at ringside. The following week as Kennedy was in the ring, the <b>hearse,</b> appearing to have nobody in the driver's seat, drove into the arena; suddenly, The Undertaker appeared from the back of the <b>hearse,</b> as Kennedy sprung from the ring. Later that night, Kane defeated Kennedy by disqualification after MVP interfered on Kennedy's behalf. On the December 15 episode of SmackDown!, The Undertaker and Kane teamed together to face Kennedy and MVP in a tag team match, which ended in neither team winning. Kennedy knocked Kane down in the aisle and jumped into the driver's seat of the <b>hearse</b> that had been at ringside for the match, and threatened to run him over with it however the Undertaker appeared in the passenger side seat scaring Kennedy off.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the loaned {{locomotives}} {{and passenger}} carriages, the LNC owned its dedicated <b>hearse</b> vans outright. Despite this, {{they were always}} painted in whichever colour scheme was currently in use by the LSWR (SR after 1923), to match the livery of the passenger cars and locomotives loaned to the LNC.|$|E
5000|$|... "Foreign" [...] style <b>hearses</b> {{are mostly}} similar in {{appearance}} to their US counterparts, although their exterior dimensions and interiors reflect the Japanese preference for smaller, less ornate caskets (this {{in light of}} the national preference for cremation). This means that, in contrast to American <b>hearses,</b> the rear quarter panels require less, and sometimes no, alteration. These are generally built from station wagons such as the Nissan Stagea, or from executive sedans such as the Toyota Celsior (Lexus LS in the US) and Nissan Cima (Infiniti Q45 in the US). Interestingly, American market vehicles such as the Lincoln Town Car and Cadillac DeVille, which are otherwise fairly uncommon in Japan, are often converted to <b>hearses</b> in both styles.|$|R

Although Opeth had Méndez, due to time constraints Åkerfeldt played bass on the album. My Arms, Your <b>Hearse</b> was released to critical acclaim on August 18, 1998.|$|E
5|$|According to Maple's account, in {{the last}} few weeks of Pickingill's life, when he had become very ill, the local people moved him to the {{infirmary}} against his will, where he declared that at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the <b>hearse</b> carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{travelled}} to Bramall Lane {{under the}} captaincy of Miller. Captain Hassett and his deputy Morris were rested {{and stayed in}} London with the team manager. After the first day's play, he organised a party for that lasted until the next afternoon—the rest day. He woke up with a hangover the next day just minutes {{before the start of}} play. Improvising, Miller arrived at the ground in a <b>hearse.</b> When it was Australia's turn to bat, Miller was the last man to be dismissed, having scored 86 despite his hangover.|$|E

5|$|During the funeral, as {{the coffin}} was {{moving from the}} <b>hearse</b> to the grave site, Navy SEALs were lined up forming a column of twos {{on both sides of}} the pallbearers route, with the coffin moving up the center. As the coffin passed each SEAL, they slapped down the gold Trident each had removed from his own uniform and deeply {{embedded}} it into the wooden coffin. For nearly 30 minutes the slaps were audible from across the cemetery as nearly every SEAL on the West Coast repeated the act.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln, Old Bob was again brought out of retirement. During the cortège preceding the funeral in Springfield, Old Bob was caparisoned in a black mourning blanket trimmed with silver fringe and tassels. Henry Brown, an African Methodist Episcopal minister and friend of the Lincoln family, led Old Bob, whose spot in the procession was immediately behind the <b>hearse</b> {{and in front of}} the carriage carrying Robert Todd Lincoln. It has been said that Robert Lincoln and Old Bob were the only members of Lincoln's family present at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|In Marion, {{the body}} of Warren Harding was placed on a horse-drawn <b>hearse,</b> which was {{followed}} by President Coolidge and Chief Justice Taft, then by Harding's wife and father. They followed it through the city, past the Star building where the presses stood silent, and at last to the Marion Cemetery, where the casket {{was placed in the}} cemetery's receiving vault. Harding's body, along with that of his wife who died in 1924, rests today in the Harding Tomb, which was dedicated in 1931 by President Hoover.|$|E
