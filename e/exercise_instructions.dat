40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of exercise on physical functions (activities of daily living, physical fitness) and medical examination parameters as risk factors for lifestyle-related diseases in 65 - to 75 -year-old women living independently at home. The women were provided <b>instruction</b> on aerobic <b>exercises</b> and resistance training for 20 weeks. This was followed by a voluntary continuation of the exercises for 3 years (140 weeks). The subjects included 69 women who participated in an <b>exercise</b> <b>instruction</b> program in a fitness class. Thirty-eight of the women voluntarily continued with the exercise program [exercise (EX) group] and 31 women did not [sedentary (SED) group]. A control group of 44 women was also established. In the control group, most of the physical function parameters tended to deteriorate after 160 weeks. The medical examination parameters also tended to worsen, with many values above the normal limits. In the EX group, however, the physical function actually improved after 160 weeks. The improved control of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hyper-glycemia was also observed. In the SED group, physical function improved after 20 weeks of <b>exercise</b> <b>instruction</b> but began to deteriorate once exercise was stopped.

30|$|Returning to exercise-based {{postoperative}} physical rehabilitation, it may {{be preferable}} to use home-based exercise or community-based exercise classes (which may have additional benefits in regard to social isolation and loneliness) in most patients, following one or more initial <b>exercise</b> <b>instructions</b> (Artz et al. 2015; Coulter et al. 2013; Pozzi et al. 2013). In this context, technology that can objectively monitor exercise adherence and stimulus intensity during home-based exercise is now available, (Rathleff et al. 2014) which enables documentation of exercise adherence and intensity {{in relation to the}} degree of observed recovery. Wearable technologies such as activity trackers and smartphone apps also offer much promise within this area, and their value in objectively assessing functional outcomes has begun to be demonstrated (Luna et al. 2017), although further objective evaluation of their specific efficacy when used as a tool to improve outcomes is still required (Bahadori et al. 2018).|$|E
30|$|However, {{some issues}} have become clearer in recent years. Firstly, {{while it has}} been {{difficult}} to demonstrate clinically relevant effects of preoperative exercise on postoperative recovery after THA and TKA (Wang et al. 2016), recent studies using supervised, pre-operative, high-volume, progressive strength training may to some extent enhance the recovery of knee-extension strength and functional performance after TKA (Calatayud et al. 2017; Skoffer et al. 2016). Secondly, exercise-based rehabilitation seems to be superior to no or minimal exercise-based rehabilitation following THA and TKA (Artz et al. 2015; Coulter et al. 2013; Pozzi et al. 2013). Thirdly, home-based physical rehabilitation, i.e. having received one or a few initial <b>exercise</b> <b>instructions,</b> seems equally effective as out-patient, supervised rehabilitation (Artz et al. 2015; Coulter et al. 2013; Pozzi et al. 2013). However, none of these interventions have solved the overall functional recovery problem after these operations. In addition, research to examine specific rehabilitation interventions for patients with known risk factors for slow or impaired functional recovery is particularly lacking.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} prehabilitation {{exercises to}} improve shoulder pain and abduction {{range of motion}} (ROM) after breast cancer surgery; to evaluate methods of exercise teaching; to assess postsurgical seroma formation. Design: Pilot study Setting: Academic medical center Participants: 60 breast cancer patients {{were randomly assigned to}} either personal <b>exercise</b> <b>instruction,</b> group 1, n= 36, or video only instruction, group 2, n= 24. Interventions: Shoulder exercises were assigned to both groups 1 month prior to surgery at an outpatient visit. Group 1 received personal <b>instruction</b> on <b>exercises,</b> plus written <b>exercise</b> <b>instruction,</b> and a link to access an online video. Group 2 received only written <b>exercise</b> <b>instruction</b> and a link to access the online video. Main Outcome Measures: Exercise compliance, pain (via visual analog scale), shoulder abduction ROM (via goniometer), and presence or absence of seroma. Results or Clinical Course: 76 % of study patients chose to exercise. There was no difference in exercise compliance between personal instruction versus video teaching. (75 %, 24 / 32 in-person vs. 77 %, 10 / 13 video only, OR= 1. 03). 66 % of patients (20 / 30) lost greater than 10 degrees shoulder abduction ROM at 1 month post surgery. 29 % of patients (9 / 31) had worse shoulder pain at one month post surgery than at baseline (24 %, 6 / 25 exercisers, and 50 %, 3 / 6 non-exercisers). 15 % of patients (4 / 27) had worse shoulder pain at 3 months post surgery than at baseline (8 %, 2 / 25 exercisers, and 100 %, 2 / 2 non-exercisers). Prehabilitation exercise program inferred no additional risk of seroma formation (21 %, 7 / 33 exercisers vs. 22 %, 2 / 9 non-exercisers OR=. 94).

Women {{who attended a}} “reducing your risk of lymphoedema” class, including <b>exercise</b> <b>instruction,</b> anecdotally reported positive BCRL outcomes. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine BCRL outcomes and perceived benefit for attendees at a “reducing your risk of lymphoedema” class between 2000 and 2005. A cross-sectional study was conducted in two parts: (1) self-report questionnaire regarding lymphoedema status and benefit received from class and exercise programme; (2) clinical evaluation and objective measurement to confirm BCRL. 46 women completed questionnaires; 40 continued to clinical evaluation and objective measurement. BCRL prevalence defined as ≥ 10  % excess limb volume was only 5  %, although clinician judgement identified 23  % with arm lymphoedema and 8  % with lymphoedema limited to the hand. Clinician judgement correlated highly with patient self-report (Kappa =  0.833, p =  0.000). All women found the class beneficial, reporting increased confidence to return to normal life and a wide range of activities/exercise. We conclude that prevalence of BCRL should be determined by both clinical judgement and objective measurement to avoid underestimation. The benefit of group education with a lymphoedema expert and of <b>exercise</b> <b>instruction</b> should be further explored, and the potential for exercise to reduce BCRL prevalence should be examined.|$|R

40|$|Background: Physiotherapist {{prescribed}} self-management {{strategies are}} an important adjunct to 'hands on' treatment. However, treatment outcomes {{are likely to be}} related to whether patients adhere to the prescribed strategy. Therefore, physiotherapists should be aware of adherence aiding interventions designed to maximise patient outcomes underpinned by quality research studies. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the interventions used to aid patient adherence to all physiotherapist prescribed self-management strategies. Data sources: The search included the databases CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PUBMED, PSYCINFO, SPORTSDiscus, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PEDro and Mednar for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in a peer reviewed journal from inception to November 2014. Data extraction and synthesis: Data were extracted using a standardised form from twelve included RCTs for patient adherence rates to self-management strategies for interventions used to aid patient adherence and usual care. Two independent reviewers conducted methodological quality assessment. Results: Twelve different interventions to aid patient adherence to exercise were recorded from twelve fair to high quality RCTs. Potential adherence aiding interventions include an activity monitor and feedback system, written <b>exercise</b> <b>instructions,</b> behavioural exercise programme with booster sessions and goal setting.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether different modes of instruction affect the learning of an exercise program, as measured by retention test performance immediately after the instruction and practice and after a 1 -day delay. Subjects. Subjects were 40 people, aged 26 to 51 years (X 38. 4, SD 7. 4), with no known shoulder pathology. Methods. Subjects were instructed in a series of 5 shoulder exercises by 1 of 4 modes of instruction: (1) live modeling, (2) corrected-error videotape, (3) error-free videotape, and (4) handout alone. Results. Subjects who received instruction from handout materials alone (handout group) exhibited poorer performance accuracy than subjects who received live or videotaped modeling and <b>exercise</b> <b>instruction.</b> In addition, the total number of errors of the handout group was more than twice the average of the live instruction and videotape instruction groups.

Conclusion: Findings demonstrate the multidimensional nature of compliance. The provision of DVD technology, while not shown to cause a statistically significant change in overall compliance, did help improve understanding of exercises; as such DVDs could be utilised as part of a program that facilitates the patient [...] therapist relationship. Implications for Rehabilitation •Limited time and level of pain are highlighted as reasons for non compliance with exercise and treatment programs. •The use of DVDs can improve understanding and execution of exercises and can be part of a treatment program that facilitates increased patient therapist contact for rural and remote clients...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Important {{considerations}} for exercise trials in cancer patients are contamination and differential drop-out among {{the control group}} members that might jeopardize the internal validity. This systematic review {{provides an overview of}} different control groups design characteristics of exercise-oncology trials and explores the association with contamination and drop-out rates. Methods Randomized controlled exercise-oncology trials from two Cochrane reviews were included. Additionally, a computer-aided search using Medline (Pubmed), Embase and CINAHL was conducted after completion date of the Cochrane reviews. Eligible studies were classified according to three control group design characteristics: the <b>exercise</b> <b>instruction</b> given to controls before start of the study (exercise allowed or not); and the intervention the control group was offered during (any (e. g., education sessions or telephone contacts) or none) or after (any (e. g., cross-over or <b>exercise</b> <b>instruction)</b> or none) the intervention period. Contamination (yes or no) and excess drop-out rates (i. e., drop-out rate of the control group minus the dropout rate exercise group) were described according to the three design characteristics of the control group and according to the combinations of these three characteristics; so we additionally made subgroups based on combinations of type and timing of instructions received. Results 40 exercise-oncology trials were included based on pre-specified eligibility criteria. The lowest contamination (7. 1 % of studies) and low drop-out rates (excess drop-out rate - 4. 7 +/- 9. 2) were found in control groups offered an intervention after the intervention period. When control groups were offered an intervention both during and after the intervention period, contamination (0 %) and excess drop-out rates (- 10. 0 +/- 12. 8 %) were even lower. Conclusions Control groups receiving an intervention during and after the study intervention period have lower contamination and drop-out rates. The present findings can be considered when designing future exercise-oncology trials...|$|R
