5|$|At the Edinburgh International Television Festival in August 2008, Moffat {{told how}} he got drunk after the wrap party for Jekyll and pitched {{the idea of a}} Press Gang reunion special to the Head of Drama at the BBC, John Yorke. Despite Yorke's approval, the writer said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> with his work on Doctor Who to pursue the idea.|$|E
5|$|The singing hobo in {{the episode}} was voiced by Hank Azaria. He would {{originally}} be voiced by Jim Carrey, but {{he dropped out}} {{when he found out}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to record his lines. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 7.8million viewers, finishing in 33rd place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its home video release, the episode received mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|When Scott Rudin was {{adapting}} Wonder Boys for the screen, {{the author}} declined {{an offer to}} write the screenplay, saying <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> writing The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. Directed by Curtis Hanson and starring Michael Douglas, Wonder Boys was released in 2000 to critical acclaim and financial failure. Having bought the film rights to The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, Rudin then asked Chabon {{to work on that}} film's screenplay. Although Chabon spent 16 months in 2001 and 2002 working on the novel's film adaptation, the project has been mired in pre-production for years.|$|E

5|$|Diệm's trip {{came after}} two years of American {{attempts}} to schedule a state visit. In 1955, Washington made two attempts to organise a trip while Diệm was still prime minister, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> quelling opposition groups and his grip on power was tenuous. Diệm took care of this by crushing the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate in the Battle for Saigon in May 1955, and then deposed Bảo Đại and proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam after his brother Ngô Đình Nhu rigged a referendum that made him head of state. Diệm was credited with 98.2% of the votes and 133% in the capital Saigon. The South Vietnamese leader's visit was organized after he indicated interest in February 1957 to US Ambassador to South Vietnam Frederick Reinhardt.|$|E
5|$|In 1723, the Commissioners of the Kent and Sussex Rother Levels {{employed}} the civil engineering contractor John Reynolds to make repairs to Scots Float Sluice, a timber {{lock on the}} lower river. He built a dovetailed sheet pile wall below the foundations, and the Commissioners offered him the job of maintaining the levels in 1725, for which he would be paid £65 per year. He moved to Iden and held the post for fourteen years. Silting of the river estuary caused mounting problems with the drainage of the levels during the 1720s. Reynolds carried out further work on the sluice in 1729, and in 1732 reconstructed it to provide an extra outlet. Several new channels were excavated through the levels in the early 1730s, {{so that all the}} runoff passed through Scots Float. Reynolds resigned his post in 1739 as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> with other engineering projects.|$|E

During the filming of Viva Las Vegas, Elvis began an affair with his co-star Ann-Margret. When Priscilla read of these reports in the press, she confronted Elvis. He told her that they were simply rumors to promote the film and that she should not believe {{everything}} that she read in the press. For the next few years, Elvis would have intimate relationships with many of his leading ladies and co-stars, all the while denying their existence to Priscilla. Eventually she was allowed to visit him in Hollywood, but her visits were kept short.|$|E
25|$|Fujian-based website Straight Consume once {{published}} an article that alleged that Zhang's eldest brother had left China and died fighting {{as part of an}} insurrection against the government of the Philippines sometime in the 1960s. According to online sources in Fujian, Zhang was said to have cut most ties with his siblings after he ascended to higher positions in the world of politics. When serving in Shenzhen, his elder brother visited him but he was said to have told his brother that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to see him. State media curiously made no mention of Zhang Xiaoyan while profiling the families of each {{of the members of the}} Politburo Standing Committee in 2013, suggesting that Zhang may not want to emphasize any connections he may have with a Hong Kong tycoon.|$|E
25|$|Jessop was a {{very modest}} man, who did not seek self-aggrandisement. Unlike other engineers, he was not jealous of rising young engineers, but rather {{encouraged}} them. He would also recommend another engineer if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> {{to be able to}} undertake a commission himself. He recommended John Rennie for the post of engineer to the Lancaster Canal Company, an appointment that helped to establish Rennie's reputation. When Jessop was consulting engineer to the Ellesmere Canal Company, in 1793, the company appointed the relatively unknown Thomas Telford as resident engineer. Telford had no previous experience as a designer of canals, but with Jessop's advice and guidance, Telford made a success of the project. He supported Telford, even when the Company thought that the latter's designs for aqueducts were too ambitious.|$|E

25|$|A retired Chicago {{police officer}} named Bill Dorsch has stated he {{has reason to}} believe {{there may be more}} victims buried within the grounds of the {{apartment}} building located at the 6100 block of West Miami Avenue in Chicago; a property which Gacy is known to have been the caretaker of for several years prior to his 1978 arrest. In 1975, Dorsch—then a Chicago police officer—observed Gacy (whom he knew on a casual basis), holding a shovel {{in the early hours of}} the morning. When confronted by Dorsch as to his actions, Gacy stated he was performing work that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to do during the day. Dorsch has also related that several other residents of West Miami Avenue have stated that, in the early- to mid-1970s, they had observed Gacy digging trenches in the grounds of the property; one of these residents has also stated that Gacy would later place plants in the elongated trenches he had dug. At the time these actions had been observed, Gacy had still been married to Carole Hoff. Following his first murder in January 1972, he is not known to have buried any murder victims beneath his own home until one month after his March, 1976 divorce. (John Butkovitch had been buried beneath his garage and the unknown victim known as Body 28 had been buried in his backyard.) Gacy's wife had informed investigators that, on several occasions in the years preceding their divorce, she had found several men's wallets and identification cards discarded about the property at 8213 Summerdale. When she had confronted Gacy about these items, he had angrily informed her the property was none of her business.|$|E

Another employee at Square, Mr. Matsushita, chose the name The Black Mages for their band. In 2003, Keiji Kawamori, Arata Hanyuda, and Michio Okamiya also joined the band.

500|$|Originally, Frog Fractions {{included}} tutorials {{to teach}} the player how to progress through the game. However, after Crawford asked his friend Tim Ambrogi to play test the game, Ambrogi stated {{that he did not}} want to read any of the informational popups that appeared throughout the game because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> focusing on the gameplay. Crawford added transitions that made the game feel like a [...] "dream-like progression", which he believed would better appeal to players. For transitions in the game's latter half, Crawford wanted the transitions to entertain players more, rather than attempt to make any sense of the game's story. PC World complimented Frog Fractions for using the transitions to draw connections between each scene to add a feeling of consistency, despite the often strange transitions that take place.|$|E
