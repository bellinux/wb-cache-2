These dates surrounds the night between the 29 th- 30 th of November,were Hennum (2013) discovered large scale fluctuations in the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>layer</b> dueto gravity wave activity over Trondheim. Similar fluctuations where found over Andenes(although not mentioned in Hennum's thesis), providing for the possibility of a mesoscale connected gravity wave system with wavefronts stretching over 700 km in the middle atmosphere. The analyses of the wind data results in a significant correlation for the mean zonal and meridional anomalies over Andenes and Trondheim. Further, balloon soundings duringthe period show that the Scandinavian mountain range does not seem to be the source,but rather a large scale moving frontal wave system, or shear waves. </p...|$|E

The climatology stretches from the 9 th of September until the 30 th of April. The wave "activity" results, from the average daily variance in the perturbed line of sight velocity, show two minima at the equinoxes and a maxima between them in mid winters. The results agree with similar studies from Rothera (68 $^{o}$S) and Esrange (68 $^{o}$N) which is comparable with Trondheim in latitude. A case study is made for the 3 rd of December comparing wave propagation directions shown in airglow images with hourly direction plots from the meteor radar. The comparison shows agreement between the two methods proving that meteor radars {{can be used to}} study preferred wave propagation directions. Monthly averaged preferred wave propagation direction results for the period 9 th of September 2012 to the 30 th of April 2013, show equatorward preferred wave propagation direcion during fall, abruptly changing through end of fall to strictly polewards in November. End of winter through start of spring shows an equatorwards and westwards preferred wave direction rotating counter clockwise to equatorwards and eastwards. The results were comparable with climatologies made with airglow imagers due to the chosen altitude range. Comparisons showed both agreement and disagreement in preferred wave propagation direction...|$|E

These fitting results were similar with theoretical calculations of 94. 3 : 5. 7 and 59. 0 : 41. 0. In a further analysis of MgxZnyAl(x+y) / 2 -LDHs, OH bonded Zn 2 Mg, Zn 2 Al, MgZnAl, Mg 2 Al and Mg 2 Zn peaks were identified at 3420, 3430, 3445 – 3450, 3454 and 3545 cm- 1, respectively. With the decrease of Mg:Zn from 3 : 1 to 1 : 3, metal-hydroxyl bands changed from OH-Mg 2 Al and MgZnAl (with a ratio of 49. 4 : 50. 6) to OH-MgZnAl and Zn 2 Al (with a ratio of 55. 0 : 45. 0). They were also similar with theoretical calculations of 47. 6 : 52. 4 and 54. 6 : 45. 4.

50|$|Due to the nanoparticulate {{nature of}} ferrihydrite, the {{structure}} has remained elusive {{for many years}} and is still a matter of controversy. Drits et al., using X-ray diffraction data, proposed a multiphase material with three components: defect-free crystallites (f-phase) with double-hexagonal stacking of oxygen and <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>layers</b> (ABAC sequence) and disordered octahedral Fe occupancies, defective crystallites (d-phase) with a short-range feroxyhite-like (δ-FeOOH) structure, and subordinate ultradisperse hematite (α-Fe2O3).

40|$|The {{possibility}} of forming magnesite from brucite crystallites, in a CO 2 -rich environment, has attracted large interest {{as a possible}} industrial procedure to store CO 2 {{in the form of}} carbonate minerals. The reaction mechanisms responsible for such processes are, however, not very well-known. In this work we first consider the compatibility of the magnesite and brucite structures, along specific crystallographic directions. In the second part we describe the sequence of events that leads to the formation of a magnesite layer, via the dehydroxylation of brucite and consequent adsorption and diffusion of carbon complexes. To observe these thermally activated events, we employ a method recently developed in our group 1, 2 for finding complex reaction pathways and reproducing the related free energy surface. We find that the (11 ̄ 00) brucite surface can be dehydroxylated quite easily. The formation of vacancies in the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>layers</b> might favor the diffusion of OH and protons through the channels between two neighboring (0001) OH planes, which characterize the brucite structure.

40|$|Temperature {{profiles}} {{from two}} satellite instruments – TIMED/SABER and Aura/MLS – {{have been used}} to calculate hydroxyl-layer equivalent temperatures for comparison with values measured from OH(6 - 2) emission lines observed by a ground-based spectrometer located at Davis Station, Antarctica (68 ° S, 78 ° E). The profile selection criteria – < 500 km from the ground station and solar zenith angles &gt; 97 ° – yielded a total of 2359 SABER profiles over 8 years (2002 – 2009) and 7407 MLS profiles over 5. 5 years (2004 – 2009). The availability of simultaneous OH volume emission rate (VER) profiles from the SABER (OH-B channel) enabled an assessment of the impact of several different weighting functions in the calculation of OH-equivalent temperatures. The maximum difference between all derived <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>layer</b> equivalent temperatures was less than 3 K. Restricting the miss-distance and miss-time criteria showed little effect on the bias, suggesting that the OH layer is relatively uniform over the spatial and temporal scales considered. However, a significant trend was found in the bias between SABER and Davis OH of ~ 0. 7 K/year over the 8 -year period with SABER becoming warmer compared with the Davis OH temperatures. In contrast, Aura MLS exhibited a cold bias of 9. 9 &plusmn; 0. 4 K compared with Davis OH, but importantly, the bias remained constant over the 2004 – 2009 year period examined. The difference in bias behaviour of the two satellites has significant implications for multi-annual and long-term studies using their data...|$|E
40|$|This project {{involved}} {{the comparison of}} horizontal winds from three different techniques in the upper mesosphere, lower thermosphere region at 80 - 105 km and the characterization of {{the ability of the}} Fabry-Perot technique to observe gravity waves in the airlow layers. The wind measurements for the comparison were obtained by three independent ground-based techniques, a meteor radar (MR), a medium frequency radar (MF) and an optical Fabry-Perot spectrometer (FPS). All three instruments are located on the South Island of New Zealand. The optical winds were derived from night-time observations of the Doppler shifts in the mesospheric 840 nm hydroxyl emission near 87 km and the lower thermospheric 557. 7 nm atomic oxygen emission at about 95 km height. The radar winds were obtained using a partial reflection medium frequency radar operating at 2. 4 MHz and a meteor radar operating at 26. 2 MHz with a pulse repetion rate of 379 Hz. The initial comparisons were made for 5 consecutive nights during May 1997. As a consequence of the results obtained the comparison of the FPS/MR combination were extended to 80 nights in the period encompassing May 1997 to April 1995. Dates considered suitable were those exhibiting no cloud and low magnetic activity. A very good correlation was observed between the FPS and MR winds for the 5 consecutive days and, albeit to a lesser degree, in the complete data set of 80 days. The good correlation between the FPS and the MR was used to determine the monthly mean height of the hydroxyl and the atomic oxygen layer over the period between May 1997 to April 1995. The result shows an annual variation in the height of the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>layer</b> with the lower height during early summer and little variation in the height of the atomic oxygen layer. The study of the detectability of the gravity waves in the FPS wind measurements reveals that waves from the part of the gravity wave spectrum which shows the most activity can only, if at all, be detected with a strongly attenuated amplitude. With knowledge of the gravity wave detect ability of the FPS, signatures of very long wavelength gravity waves were sought in the available data set. On many nights signatures of wave activity which could be related to gravity waves were found. The attempt to use the MR data set to aid in the determination of the wavelength of those waves was of limited success...|$|E

Results revealed that the planes of NO 3 - and CO 32 - are parallel with the layers in dehydrated state, although the plane of NO 3 - becomes vertical with the layers upon the introduction of water molecules. Electronic density analysis suggested that SO 42 - and CO 32 - significantly strengthens the reducibility of the Li/Al layered double hydroxides. The distribution of the frontier orbitals indicated the high reactivity of the anions and hydroxyl groups of the layers. The orders of the predicted stability are F- > Cl- >Br- >NO 3 - for the monovalent anions and SO 42 - > CO 32 - for the divalent anions. The calculated adsorption energies of CO 2 in Li/Al-X (X= Cl-, NO 3 -, CO 32 -) supported the experimental observation that Li/Al-CO 3 exhibits higher CO 2 capture capacity than Li/Al-NO 3 and Li/Al-Cl. Non-covalent interaction analysis indicated that the interactions among mineral surfaces, anions, water and CO 2 are dominated by H-bonds, electrostatic interactions, and van der Waals forces.

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{identify}} the influences imposed by Fe substitution, density functional theory-based Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations were employed to study both oxidized and reduced Fe-bearing smectites. The following basic properties were investigated: local structures in the clay <b>layer,</b> <b>hydroxyl</b> orientations, and the vibration dynamics of H and Si. Structural analyses indicated that the average FeO bond lengths are ~ 2. 08 A ̊ and 2. 02 A ̊ in the reduced and oxidized models, respectively, and the Fe substitutions {{did not affect the}} coordination structures of the AlO and SiO polyhedra. For hydroxyl orientations, Fe(III) substitution had no obvious influence but Fe(II) forces the coordinated hydroxyls to present a wide-angle distribution. Furthermore, the present work has shown that both substitutions can red-shift the hydroxyl in-plane bending mode. The analyses also revealed that Fe(III) substitution has no effect on the SiO stretching, while Fe reduction causes a blue-shift of the out-of-plane stretching mode.

Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (AMTM) showed the presence of small-scale (25 _ 28 ækm) waves within the warm phase of the large mountain wave. The simulation results show rapid breaking above 70 ækm altitude, with the preferential formation of almost-stationary vortical instabilities within the warm phase front of the mountain wave. An OH airglow model {{is used to}} identify the presence of small-scale wave-like structures generated in situ by the breaking of the mountain wave that are consistent with those seen in the observations. While it is easy to interpret these feature as waves in OH airglow data, a considerable fraction of the features are in fact instabilities and vortex structures. Simulations suggest that a combination of a large westward perturbation velocity and shear, in combination with strong perturbation temperature gradients, causes both dynamic and convective instability conditions to be met particularly where the wave wind is maximized and the temperature gradient is simultaneously minimized. This leads to the inevitable breaking and subsequent generation of smaller-scale waves and instabilities which appear most prominent within the warm phase front of the mountain wave. © 2017.

The tablets were evaluated for weight variation test, hardness, thickness, friability, tablet disintegration time, content uniformity and in vitro dissolution studies. In vitro drug release studies were performed using the type-II dissolution apparatus (paddle) using 0. 1 N Hydrochloric acid for first 2 hours and the remaining hours with 6. 8 pH phosphate buffer. Among all the formulations, optimized formulation F 5 showed a maximum of 99. 4 % drug release at 45 minutes for Losartan potassium and Repaglinide has an in vitro drug release of 99. 87 %. Therefore, bilayer tablets in combination of these two drugs can be used to improve the management of hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes mellitus. –II.

In the current work, we studied the biological response of human osteoblasts with a bioactive glass. This bioactive glass is based on 50 % Si 0 (2), 20 % Na(2) O, 16 % CaO, 6 % P(2) O(5), 5 % K(2) 0, 2 % Al(2) O(3) and 1 % MgO and designated A 9. Cracks and irregularities were observed on the material surface when it was immersed in the culture medium. In addition, energy dispersive X-ray analyses highlighted a selective release of the elements at {{the surface of the}} bioactive glass, such as Na(+) and K(+) ions, released from the first day, contrary to the Si, Al, Ca, P, and Mg elements, which were released more slowly. Cell proliferation kinetics, total protein synthesis, and DNA content of the osteoblasts in contact with bioactive glass were similar to control cells. The morphological studies by light and scanning electron microscopy revealed an increasing cellular density in culture with bioactive glass without contact inhibition. The immunohistochemical studies highlighted the expression of types I, III, and V collagens by osteoblasts cultured in the presence of bioactive glass. The pH measurement of the culture medium in the presence of bioactive glass demonstrated a slight alkalinization. We thus conclude that human osteoblasts preserve their properties in the presence of bioactive glass (A 9) ...|$|R
30|$|Upon {{comparison}} {{of the changes in}} surface composition data of the cast crystalline and sol–gel samples as well as the results of the Si modeling to the same timeline of surface reaction {{it can be said that}} the increases in surface Ca and P suggest that the first steps of biomineralization have been completed and the materials were most likely adsorbing amorphous Ca, PO 4 and CO 3 [9]. Furthermore, the SiO found on the same surfaces means that both the sol–gel and cast crystalline samples are still undergoing polycondensation of SiOH and adsorption of Ca and P as discussed above. Determining the position of the cast amorphous bioactive glass on the timeline was more difficult in that the XPS data only showed a decrease in Si and increases in S and N after incubation in plasma. The lack of detectable SiO on the surface of the cast amorphous sample could mean that the sample has not undergone any surface biomineralization reactions or that is has moved beyond the polycondensation step. As discussed above, the decrease in Si could be attributed to SiO 2 dissolution or may be a result of changes in the surface profile of the sample as adsorption of hydroxyl carbonyl apatite components occurred. At hour 3 of the interfacial reaction timeline the adsorption of the components of hydroxyl carbonyl apatite has ceased and the crystallization of these components is complete. The primary active process is the adsorption of various biological entities, such as proteins, to the newly formed <b>hydroxyl</b> carbonyl apatite <b>layer.</b> This may be reflected in the results by the presence of N and S, elements indicative of proteins. Furthermore, the similarity of the Si signals for cast amorphous bioactive glass before and after incubation is consistent with what has been observed the literature [43].|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The crystal {{structure}} of nacrite from Pike's Peak district, Colorado, has been refined by least squares and electron density difference maps utilizing ten levels of data. Complete refinement was inhibited by thick domains involving a/ 3 interlayer {{shifts in the}} "wrong direction". The ideal structure {{is based on a}} 6 R stacking sequence of kaolin layers, in which each successive layer is shifted relative to the layer below by [...] ~ of the 8. 9 A. lateral repeat. This direction is X in nacrite, contrary to the usual convention for layer silicates, because of the positioning of the (010) symmetry planes normal to the 5. 1, ~ repeat direction. Alternate layers are also rotated by 180 ~ The pattern of vacant octahedral sites reduces the symmetry to Cc and permits description of the structure as a 2 -layer form with an inclined Z axis. Adjacent etrahedra re twisted by 7 - 3 ~ in opposite directions o that the basal oxygens approach more closely both the AI cations in the same layer and the surface <b>hydroxyls</b> of the <b>layer</b> below. Interlocking corrugations in the oxygen and hydroxyl surfaces of adjacent layers run alternately parallel to the [I 10] and [170] zones in successive layers. The upper and lower anion triads in each Al-octahedron are rotated by 5. 4 ~ and 7 - 0 ~ in opposite directions as a result of shared edge shortening. Nacrite has a greater interlayer separation and smaller lateral dimensions than dickite and kaolinite, and the observed/ 3 angle deviates by 189 ~ from the ideal value. These features, as well as its overall lesser stability, are believed due to the less favorable positioning in nacrite of the basal oxygens relative to the directed interlayer hydrogen bonds...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} the inhibition of protein adsorption by polyethylene oxide (PEO) are not completely understood, but {{it is believed that}} PEO chain length, chain density and chain conformation all play a role. In this work, surfaces formed by chemisorption of PEO-thiol to gold were investigated: the effects of PEO chain density, chain length (600, 750, 2000 and 5000 ?MW) and end-group (-OH, -OCH 3) on protein adsorption from plasma are reported. Similar to previous single protein adsorption studies (L. D. Unsworth et al., Langmuir 2005; 21 : 1036 - 41) it was found that, of the different surfaces investigated, PEO layers formed from solutions near the cloud point adsorbed the lowest amount of fibrinogen from plasma. Layers of hydroxyl-terminated PEO of MW 600 formed under these low solubility conditions showed almost complete suppression (versus controls) of the Vroman effect, with 20 ? 1 ?ng/cm 2 adsorbed fibrinogen at the Vroman peak and 6. 7 ? 0. 6 ?ng/cm 2 at higher plasma concentration. By comparison, Vroman peak adsorption was 70 ? 20 and 50 ? 3 ?ng/cm 2, respectively, for 750 -OCH 3 and 2000 -OCH 3 layers formed under low solubility conditions; adsorption on these surfaces at higher plasma concentration was 16 ? 9 and 12 ? 3 ?ng/cm 2. Thus in addition to the effect of solution conditions noted previously, {{the results of this study}} also suggest a chain end group effect which inhibits fibrinogen adsorption to, and/or facilitates displacement from, <b>hydroxyl</b> terminated PEO <b>layers.</b> Fibrinogen adsorption from plasma was not significantly different for surfaces prepared with PEO of molecular weight 750 and 2000 when the chain density was the same (~ 0. 5 ?chains/nm 2) supporting the conclusion that chain density may be the key property for suppression of protein adsorption. The proteins eluted from the surfaces after contact with plasma were investigated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. A number of proteins were detected on the various surfaces including fibrinogen, albumin, C 3 and apolipoprotein A-I. The blot responses were zero or weak for all four proteins of the contact system; some complement activation was observed on all of the surfaces studied. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|The Precambrian-Cambrian Athel Silicilyte is {{an enigmatic}} chert unit {{of up to}} 390 m thick found as slabs (each slab {{typically}} 2 × 6 km across) entrapped within salt domes {{at a depth of}} 4 - 5 km in the South Oman Salt Basin. This formation is a prolific self-charged reservoir with high porosity (up to 34 %) and high oil saturation (80 %). Despite its economic value, the origin and the variability of this formation are not fully understood. This study therefore aims to investigate the variability and the origin (silica source and precipitation mechanism) of the Athel Silicilyte. Data obtained from core, wireline log and petrographical analysis were employed to establish the vertical and the lateral variability and, with the assistance of geochemical data, the likely source and precipitation mechanism of silica was determined. The Athel Silicilyte is only present in the deepest parts of the South Oman Salt Basin within the fault-bounded Athel Basin, bounded by two silt-rich mudstone units. Six lithofacies were recognised in the Athel Silicilyte that reflect variability in detrital material contents (three silica-rich facies), sediment remobilisation (slumped and brecciated lithofacies) and diagenetic modification (carbonate-bearing lithofacies), with the silica-rich facies being the most abundant (> 97 % of the total thickness). The Athel Silicilyte exhibits wavy discontinuous lamination and it is predominately (silica-rich facies average = 80 wt. %) composed of connected-networks of microcrystalline quartz (1 - 5 µm). Other constituent components are detrital quartz (3 wt. %), illite (10 wt. %), pyrite (4 wt. %) and organic carbon (TOC = 3 wt. %). The detrital contents increase towards the Upper Athel Silicilyte and towards the basin margins (ranging from 3 to 30 wt. %). The wavy laminations are interpreted to have a microbial origin. The homogeneity, loose packing of detrital grains and preservation of 390 m thick laminated fabric suggest that the Athel Silicilyte precipitated syndepositionally in microbial layers during low detrital input. The intense detrital input during bounding mudstones sedimentation inhibited Athel Silicilyte precipitation {{as a result of the}} rapid burial of microbial layers. The Athel Silicilyte shows strong enrichments of redox-sensitive elements (U, V and Mo), Mn-depletion, positive Ce anomalies, and small framboidal pyrites (3. 6 - 4. 0 µm), suggesting that the water column was euxinic during precipitation. Based on the petrographical evidence for the Athel Silicilyte forming as a syndepositional precipitate alongside seawater-like rare earth element (REE) characteristics, silica is interpreted to have been sourced directly from seawater. Mass balance calculations support this interpretation, indicating that silica-rich Precambrian seawater provided the significant silica mass in the Athel Silicilyte. The ability of dissolved silica to form hydrogen bonds with the functional groups (e. g. carboxyl and <b>hydroxyl)</b> in microbial <b>layers</b> was the key for Athel Silicilyte precipitation. The formation of hydrogen bonds was made possible under euxinic conditions, where the pH values were probably lower (< 7) than for the normal seawater as a result of HS- and H+ production by sulphate reducing bacteria and HS- oxidation at the redox boundary by sulphur oxidising bacteria. Consequently, dissolved silica was concentrated in microbial layer microenvironemnts, resulting in silica nucleation and polymerisation.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Özyeğin University, Graduate School of Sciences and Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, January 2015. The {{aim of the}} {{microelectronics}} {{industry has}} historically been achieving increasing functionality through decreasing the device sizes while simultaneously reducing the unit manufacturing costs. This objective has been achieved by the implementation of multilevel metallization (MLM) based {{on the development of}} advanced photolithography processes and the chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process that enabled the successful patterning through photolithography by planarization of the wafer surfaces. The projected targets of the Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturing are facing some physical barriers with the current and forthcoming needs of the semiconductor industry to develop future metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET). These challenges entail the introduction of new and more difficult materials to achieve better device performance such as use of Germanium due to its higher electron mobility to build faster microprocessors, as well as the use of III-V semiconductors such as GaN, GaAs or InAs which are being tested for high power device applications. Furthermore, new ideas such as reduced power consumption and ability of energy harvesting introduced ferroelectric and magnetic memories, as well as piezoelectric transducers which involve variety of materials harder to integrate to conventional semiconductor manufacturing. Chemical Mechanical Planarization process {{is one of the key}} enablers for the integration of the new materials into the current semiconductor fabrication processes. CMP functions on the principle of chemically modifying the surface to be polished while this surface is continuously abraded mechanically by the Nano-particles homogeneously suspended in the slurry environment. Development of new CMP processes require a robust slurry formulation that can provide high material removal rates (MRR) to promote high volume manufacturing throughput with low dissolution rates (DR) to achieve topographic selectivity and global planarity, in addition to creating minimum surface defectivity surface roughness values. Hence, it is important to understand the chemical and mechanical nature of the CMP process to better control the process and design future processes for the new generation materials. This dissertation focuses on the characterization of the chemically modified thin films which form during the CMP applications through the exposure of the surface to be polished to the slurry chemicals to optimize the process performance at a Nano-scale. The overall study is presented in two main sections the first part focusing on the findings on the chemically formed metal oxide thin films on metal CMP applications and the second part focusing on the chemically modified thin film characterization on the nonmetal CMP applications. On metal CMP applications, chemically modified thin films are required to be protective oxides to achieve topographic selectivity. Therefore, the chemically modified thin films of the metal (tungsten) substrates were characterized for thickness and composition as well as their protective nature by calculating their Pilling-Bethworth (P-B) ratio comparing the volume of oxide to the volume of the metal underneath. The analyses have shown a layered oxide film formation with the very top oxide film was detected to be a hydroxyl compound of the tungsten followed by W/WOx combination in the lower layers until a pure W substrate is reached. Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that the surface topography of the tungsten wafers tend to change as a function of the oxidizer concentration. The observed changes in the surface topography were also found to affect the wettability and the total surface energy. Hence, it is obvious that the protective nature, as well as the surface nano-topography of the metal oxide thin films need to be studied to assess the metal CMP performance at a nano-scale. Changes in the surface roughness and topography with the oxidizer concentration were also studied through a mathematical modeling approach using Cahn-Hilliard Equation (CHE) approximation. CHE explains the formation of surface nano-structures in terms of reverse diffusion principal and expected to shed light to understanding the changes in the material removal rate mechanisms as a function of the CMP process variables. In the second half of the dissertation, slurry formulations are evaluated to characterize the chemically modified thin films to enhance selectivity for germanium/silica (Ge/SiO 2) CMP systems. The chemically modified thin films are mainly the <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>layers</b> formed by the dissolution of the materials such as silicon, silica or germanium in front end applications of the CMP. To evaluate the impact of chemically modified thin films of the Ge/SiO 2 system, it is necessary to modify these chemically modified films with oxidizers and surface active agents (surfactants) since the function of the chemically modified layers in these applications is to achieve optimal removal rate selectivity. Therefore, initially selectivity analyses were conducted by wear rate responses measured at a single particle-surface interaction level through Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) with and without the use of surfactants. Both anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate-SDS) and cationic (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-C 12 TAB) surfactants were evaluated at their sub-micelle and above critical micelle concentrations (CMC) as a function of pH and oxidizer concentrations. CMP performances of Ge and SiO 2 wafers were evaluated in terms of material removal rates, selectivity and surface quality. This dissertation is composed of seven chapters. The first chapter discusses the importance of nano-scale chemically modified thin films for chemical mechanical planarization process by an introduction to CMP process. Chapter 2 reviews the main components of the CMP process, its integration at the front end, middle section and back end of the line applications, as well as the importance of the characterization of the chemically modified thin films in CMP development. Chapter 3 discusses metal oxide protective thin film characterization for metal CMP applications by focusing on the growth and protective nature of the metal oxide thin films on CVD deposited tungsten wafers pre and post polishing in the presence of an oxidizer. In Chapter 4, CMP performance of the tungsten wafers are evaluated based on the material removal rate and surface quality analyses as a function of the changes in the slurry solids loading and H 2 O 2 concentration as an oxidizer. Chapter 5 focuses on germanium/silica CMP through wear rate testing as a preliminary predictive approach as well as through standard CMP MRR evaluations to define a suitable slurry formulation with sufficient selectivity and removal rate performance. Chapter 6 extends the current knowledge base on the use of surfactant systems from standard shallow trench isolation (STI) CMP to Ge- based STI CMP. CMP results are reported with slurries made of silica particles with 3 wt % solids loading and 200 - 300 nm particle size in the presence of surfactants and 0. 1 M H 2 O 2 as an oxidizer. The optimal conditions for slurry formulations are presented as a function of pH and oxidizer concentration on Ge/SiO 2 selectivity statistically through design of experiments (DOE). Finally, Chapter 7 provides a summary of the reported findings of this dissertation, and the suggested future work.
