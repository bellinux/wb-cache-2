5|$|Two Deputy Returning Officers {{were charged}} by the DGEQ with violating {{elections}} laws, but in 1996 were found not guilty (a decision upheld by the Quebec Court of Appeal), after {{it was found that}} the ballots were not rejected in a fraudulent or irregular manner, and that there was no proof of conspiracy. A Quebec Court judge acquitted a <b>Deputy</b> <b>Returning</b> <b>Officer</b> charged with illegally rejecting 53% of the ballots cast at his Chomedey polling district.|$|E
25|$|Wherever possible, {{election}} {{officers at}} polling stations speak both official languages (English and French). In addition, a <b>deputy</b> <b>returning</b> <b>officer</b> can appoint and swear in an interpreter to help communicate with a voter.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} was overseen by Returning Officer A. G. Randall, who was assisted by <b>Deputy</b> <b>Returning</b> <b>Officer</b> E. J. Bangs, Election Clerk J. C. F. Brown, Poll Clerk J. R. Michael, and Constable F. Shaw (who provided a mounted police patrol at the poll through election day).|$|E

5|$|After the referendum, {{the ballot}} for Quebec {{elections}} was redesigned {{to reduce the}} size of the space where voters could indicate their choice and the rules on allowable markings were relaxed, so that <b>Deputy</b> <b>Returning</b> <b>Officers</b> would have fewer grounds for rejecting ballots. The Quebec government also changed the Electoral Act so that voters would need to show a Canadian passport, Quebec drivers' licence or Quebec provincial health care card at the polling station for identification purposes in future elections.|$|R
500|$|Controversy arose {{over whether}} the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Returning</b> <b>Officers</b> of the Chomedey, Marguerite-Bourgeois and Laurier-Dorion ridings had {{improperly}} rejected ballots. In these ridings the [...] "No" [...] vote was dominant, {{and the proportion of}} rejected ballots was 12%, 5.5% and 3.6%. Thomas Mulcair, member of the Quebec National Assembly for Chomedey, told reporters that there was [...] "an orchestrated attempt to steal the vote" [...] in his riding. A study released months after the referendum by McGill University concluded that ridings with a greater amount of [...] "No" [...] votes had a higher percentage of rejected ballots. Directeur général des élections du Québec (DGEQ), Pierre F. Cote, launched an inquiry into the alleged irregularities, supervised by the Chief Justice of the Quebec Superior Court, Alan B. Gold. All ballots of the three ridings plus a sample of ballots from other ridings were examined. The inquiry concluded that some ballots had been rejected without valid reasons, but the incidents were isolated. The majority of the rejected ballots were [...] "No" [...] votes, in proportion to the majority of the valid votes in those districts.|$|R
25|$|However, {{following}} the declaration, the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Returning</b> <b>Officer</b> discovered {{an error in}} the calculation of the results which meant that the 'mixed' votes - where a voter had split their two votes between candidates of different parties - had all been counted twice. As Ebanks was the BNP's only candidate in the ward, {{a large number of}} her votes had been 'split' in this way, with voters casting one vote for the BNP and one vote for another party. Because of this, a large proportion of BNP votes had been double-counted. 2,367 votes had been counted twice, including just under 1,000 votes cast in support of Ebanks.|$|E
25|$|Simeon was the {{returning}} officer {{for many of}} the early elections held in Canterbury. When it came to the election of the first Superintendent for the Canterbury Province, Simeon made the controversial decision of allowing Colonel James Campbell to stand for election, but declaring that should he be elected, he would not allow the election as Campbell was not on the Akaroa roll. In November 1852, Simeon announced his intention to stand in the first election for the New Zealand Parliament. In June 1853, he advertised that he had changed his mind, as his role as Resident Magistrate kept him too busy that he could leave the region for long periods attending Parliament in Auckland, and that he would stand for election in the Christchurch Country electorate for the Canterbury Provincial Council instead. He received the power from the Governor to appoint a <b>deputy</b> <b>returning</b> <b>officer</b> in case he wanted to stand in one of the elections himself. Five candidates stood for the four positions, and Simeon {{was at the top of}} the poll with 158 votes; the other successful candidates were Henry Tancred (154 votes), John Hall (151 votes), and Charles Bowen (132 votes). Simeon was the first Speaker of the Provincial Council from September 1853 to April 1855; he was succeeded in that role by Charles Bowen. He was a member of the Canterbury Executive Council from October 1853 to October 1854 and was the first Provincial Treasurer. During a day of low attendance in October 1854, Richard Packer secured a suspension of the council's standing orders, which allowed him to have the first two readings of a bill to enlarge the council's membership by 12 additional members passed. Whilst there was justification for such a measure due to the long session lengths, the Executive Council consisting of Henry Tancred, Henry Godfrey Gouland, Simeon, and William John Warburton Hamilton regarded the matter as a vote of no confidence and resigned. Simeon was a provincial councillor until his resignation on 5 September 1855 in preparation for returning to England. The resulting by-election was contested by three candidates and won by James Henry Moore.|$|E
500|$|When the {{counting}} was completed, approximately 86,000 ballots were rejected by Deputy Returning Officers, alleging {{that they had}} not been marked properly by the voter. Each polling station featured a <b>Deputy</b> <b>Returning</b> <b>Officer</b> (appointed by the [...] "Yes") who counted the ballots while a Poll Clerk (appointed by the [...] "No") recorded the result of the count.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas [...] "Tom" [...] Goode jun. (1846 - 14 July 1921) born in Hereford, {{came out}} with his parents, was educated at St Peter's College {{and for a few}} years in England but {{returned}} to take over the business when his father took ill. He also held interests (as Goode & Johnston) in steamers serving Lakes Albert and Alexandrina, and owned the paddle-steamer City of Oxford. He was a Justice of the Peace and a Commissioner of Affidavits of the Supreme Court, was at one time Mayor of Goolwa, and was President of the local Agricultural Society, and also of the Regatta Club and Institute. He was also President of the British and Foreign Bible Society. Tom Goode acted as <b>deputy</b> electoral <b>returning</b> <b>officer</b> for a long period, was captain of the local rifle club, and was a non-commissioned officer of cavalry under Lieut.-Col. Higgins {{at the time of the}} visit of the Duke of Edinburgh to Adelaide. He was present at the opening of the bridge over the creek at Ashbourne, and at the laying of the foundation stone of the Adelaide G.P.O., which ceremonies were performed by the Duke of Edinburgh. He was also a member of the Encounter Bay School Board of Advice, a local preacher in the Methodist Church, and superintendent of the Sunday school for 40 years, a member of the Corinthian Lodge of Freemasons, and Past Master of the Grand Lodge of South Australia.He died after a brief illness and a subsequent operation.|$|R
50|$|In practice, {{the task}} of {{conducting}} the election is delegated to an acting <b>returning</b> <b>officer,</b> who is usually a senior officer in the local authority (the only duties which can be reserved and undertaken by the <b>returning</b> <b>officer</b> {{are related to the}} receipt of the writ and the declaration of the result, and only if written notice is given by the <b>returning</b> <b>officer</b> to the acting <b>returning</b> <b>officer).</b> In an English or Welsh constituency where the <b>returning</b> <b>officer</b> {{is the chairman of the}} local council or borough council respectively, the Electoral Registration Officer is automatically the acting <b>returning</b> <b>officer.</b> In an English or Welsh constituency where the high sheriff or mayor is <b>returning</b> <b>officer,</b> the acting <b>returning</b> <b>officer</b> is designated by the Secretary of State for Justice.|$|R
50|$|In Scotland, {{there is}} no office of acting <b>returning</b> <b>officer</b> and the {{position}} of <b>returning</b> <b>officer</b> is not an honorary one. The <b>returning</b> <b>officer</b> for general elections is the same {{person who has been}} appointed <b>returning</b> <b>officer</b> for the election of councillors in the local authority in which the constituency is situated. If a constituency covers more than one local authority area, the Secretary of State for Justice designates which local authority <b>returning</b> <b>officer</b> will discharge the function.|$|R
500|$|During the 2000 Canadian federal election, Hudema {{was part}} of a group calling itself the Edible Ballot Society, the members of which ate their ballots (Hudema stir-fried his) as a protest against what they saw as a lack of true {{democracy}} and a system that only asked for individuals' participation once every four years. [...] He was charged, along {{with other members of the}} EBS, with [...] "unlawfully and willfully altering, defacing or destroying a ballot or the initials of the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Returning</b> <b>Officer</b> signed on a ballot contrary to section 167(2)(a) of the Canada Elections Act thereby committing an offence under subsection 489(3)(e)". The charges were eventually dropped.|$|E
2500|$|In Quebec City, several ballot boxes {{containing}} {{votes from}} advance polls disappeared after {{the close of}} advance polling on October 7. The boxes were stored in a closet {{at the home of}} a <b>deputy</b> <b>returning</b> <b>officer.</b> Although there was no tampering of the boxes or the votes, three deputy returning officers were fired. Deputy returning officers are the only polling officials allowed to handle ballots during the vote count and the law did allow for them to store the sealed boxes as may be necessary in large remote rural ridings. [...] However the boxes were returned a day late after the riding returning officer ordered their return.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1995 SRC election, {{there was}} a major scandal {{involving}} postal ballots sent to Glenn College. A group of four candidates associated with the Australian Labor Party (ALP) contested the election as the [...] "Tin Tin for NUS" [...] ticket. It was discovered that one of the students, Stephen Donnelly, had gained access to the postal ballots during the delivery process. When challenged to explain their behaviour, all four candidates withdrew their nominations. The <b>deputy</b> <b>returning</b> <b>officer</b> writes that the candidates Stephen Donnelly, Robert Larocca, Nigel Rhode and Robin Scott were charged with Dishonest Conduct and Interfering with Ballot Papers. He escalated the matter to the Dean of Glenn College and then the University Secretary but found them disinterested and the matter was never formally prosecuted by the police. Stephen Donnelly has subsequently become the Assistant State Secretary in the Victorian branch of the ALP.|$|E

50|$|In Canada, {{a spoiled}} ballot {{is one that}} has been handled by an elector in such a manner that it is ruined beyond use, or that the <b>deputy</b> <b>returning</b> <b>officer</b> finds soiled or {{improperly}} printed.

A 'rejected ballot' is one which cannot be counted due to improper marking by the voter. Examples of this are ballots which have more than one mark, the intent of the voter cannot be ascertained, or the voter can be identified by their mark.|$|E
