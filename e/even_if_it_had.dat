5|$|Dubnium {{with its}} atomic number 105 is a superheavy element; like all {{elements}} of such high atomic number, it is highly unstable. The most stable known isotope of dubnium, 268Db, has a half-life of around a day. Thus, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> once existed on Earth, it would have decayed completely long ago and can only be obtained by artificial production.|$|E

5|$|The only {{abnormality}} {{found in}} all four engines was the vapour vent float in the fuel strainer chamber of the carburettors. The floats had been crushed by extreme fuel pressure. Inquiries {{were made to the}} engine manufacturer and other civil aviation authorities but none had prior experience of vapour vent floats collapsing. Tests on carburettors were also carried out in Australia by the Aeronautical Research Laboratories but without finding any suitable explanation. Whether the floats were crushed in flight or in the crash could not be determined, but <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> occurred in flight it would not have affected operation of the engines.|$|E
5|$|According to Philip Van Tricht, Theodore's {{actions were}} {{motivated}} by several factors, which led him to regard Peter {{as a threat to}} himself and his principality. Peter's attempt to return Dyrrhachium to Venice, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> failed for the moment, boded ill for the future. Peter's recognition of the rights of Demetrius' half-brother William VI of Montferrat over Thessalonica opened the way for William to take power there, and Theodore was loath to see Thessalonica—whose rulers still claimed suzerainty over Epirus—strengthened, particularly given the presence of his exiled nephew Michael II in the court of the Latin Principality of Achaea. At the same time, Theodore and his court resented the increased papal interference in Greek affairs, especially {{in the aftermath of the}} mission of Cardinal Pelagius, the previous papal legate to Constantinople, whose actions had deepened the rift between Greeks and Latins further.|$|E

25|$|The {{board of}} {{directors}} of the PHC filed suit against GESPHC, John Walter, and Frederick Heider on January 25, 1888. They accused the organization and two men of seeking to seize the cemetery's revenues, conflicts of interest, illegally transferring title to the cemetery, and illegally subdividing the cemetery. The GESPHC countersued, arguing that the PHC had never been duly organized under the charter of 1860. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had,</b> the GESPHC said, the PHC's actions were tainted and irregular due to the voting rights given to individuals who were not members of the German Evangelical Society.|$|E
25|$|The 1984 {{election}} was called when Marilyn Waring told Muldoon {{that she would}} not support his government in the vote over an opposition-sponsored anti-nuclear bill. Muldoon, visibly drunk, announced a snap election on national television. There is debate over whether the {{election was}} necessary — Waring had not threatened to block confidence and supply, meaning that the government could still have continued on <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> lost the anti-nuclear vote. Nevertheless, Muldoon appears to have wanted an election to reinforce his mandate (just as Sidney Holland sought and won a mandate to oppose striking dock-workers with the 1951 snap election).|$|E

It stated that the weather data which the pilots received at Værnes did not predict the conditions which led to the icing. However, it found that had the pilots conferenced in person with a meteorologist concerning the weather along the whole route the conditions may have been discovered in advance, and recommended that such procedures developed.|$|E
25|$|Major-General Oliver Nugent (36th (Ulster) Division), {{reported}} that German artillery could not bombard advancing British {{troops in the}} German forward zone, in which the defensive positions were lightly held and distributed in depth. The advance of British troops following-up had been much easier to obstruct but helping the foremost infantry {{was more important than}} counter-battery fire, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> failed to suppress the German guns. Nugent wanted fewer field guns in the creeping barrage and the surplus firing sweeping barrages (from side-to-side). Shrapnel shells should be fuzed to burst higher up, to hit the inside of shell holes and creeping barrages should be slower, with more and longer pauses, during which the barrages from field artillery and 60-pounder guns should sweep and search (move back-and-forth).|$|E
25|$|These factors led to {{the shift}} of the store of value being the metal itself: at first silver, then both silver and gold, {{and at one point}} there was bronze as well. Now we have copper coins and other non-precious metals as coins. Metals were mined, weighed, and stamped into coins. This was to assure the {{individual}} taking the coin that he was getting a certain known weight of precious metal. Coins could be counterfeited, but they also created a new unit of account, which helped lead to banking. Archimedes' principle provided the next link: coins could now be easily tested for their fine weight of metal, and thus the value of a coin could be determined, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been shaved, debased or otherwise tampered with (see Numismatics).|$|E

25|$|Judge Debra Ann Livingston {{wrote for}} a panel that {{took two years}} to decide the case. It found that while that act was constitutionally protected, the {{balancing}} test established by Pickering v. Board of Education actually improved the MTA's case under Mt. Healthy, since although it was speech on {{a matter of public}} concern it was disruptive to the MTA's operations since it breached the confidentiality the plaintiff was required to maintain about security matters and internal investigations as part of his job duties. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> not been so disruptive, the court held, his record of insubordination and deception of several of the defendants was enough reason for him to have been disciplined and fired—indeed he had even admitted he believed his job to be in jeopardy before he had contacted the Times.|$|E
25|$|If a cow had {{two black}} or white hairs growing within one follicle, it was invalid. Rabbi Judah said even within one hollow. If the hairs grew within two {{adjacent}} follicles, the cow was invalid. Rabbi Akiva ruled that {{even if there were}} four or even five non-red hairs, if they were dispersed, they could be plucked out. Rabbi Eliezer ruled that even as many as 50 such hairs could be plucked. But Rabbi Joshua ben Bathyra ruled that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> only one non-red hair on its head and one on its tail, it was invalid. If the cow had two hairs in one follicle with their roots black and their tips red or with their roots red and their tips black, Rabbi Meir taught that what was visible determined validity; but the Sages ruled that validity followed the root.|$|E
25|$|Following the operation, China and Russia {{criticized the}} U.S. operation. The {{destruction}} of USA-193 came {{just weeks after}} Russia had drafted a new treaty to ban space weapons which was backed by China at a UN-sponsored forum. This treaty would ban the use of weapons against satellites or other spacecraft. This prompted the Russians to accuse the United States of using the hydrazine gas as a cover-up to test an anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon. They claimed that several countries’ satellites which used toxic fuel have crashed into the Earth {{in the past but}} never warranted such “extraordinary measures”. Furthering this notion, others have speculated that the toxic gas would have likely not survived re-entry regardless, and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> that the risk would be extremely small. These speculations have led many to believe that Operation Burnt Frost was in response to China’s ASAT test on 11 January, 2007 and to fear this would begin another “space race”.|$|E
