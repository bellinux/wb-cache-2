5000|$|A modern <b>gel</b> <b>battery</b> (also {{known as}} a [...] "gel cell") is a VRLA battery with a gelified electrolyte; the sulfuric acid is mixed with fumed silica, which makes the {{resulting}} mass gel-like and immobile. Unlike a flooded wet-cell lead-acid battery, these batteries {{do not need to}} be kept upright. Gel batteries reduce the electrolyte evaporation, spillage (and subsequent corrosion problems) common to the wet-cell battery, and boast greater resistance to shock and vibration. Chemically they are almost the same as wet (non-sealed) batteries except that the antimony in the lead plates is replaced by calcium, and gas recombination can take place.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{of calcium}} added to its plates to reduce water loss, a sealed AGM or <b>gel</b> <b>battery</b> recharges {{more quickly than}} a flooded lead acid battery of either VRLA or {{conventional}} design. [...] "From a standard car, 4WD or truck alternator they will recharge quickly from full use in about 2 to 3 hours. A deep cycle wet cell battery can take 8-12 hours to achieve only 70% to 80% of its potential charge." [...] Compared to flooded batteries, VRLA batteries are more vulnerable to thermal runaway during abusive charging. The electrolyte cannot be tested by hydrometer to diagnose improper charging that can reduce battery life.|$|E

50|$|The first {{lead-acid}} <b>gel</b> <b>battery</b> {{was invented}} by Elektrotechnische Fabrik Sonneberg in 1934. The modern gel or VRLA battery {{was invented by}} Otto Jache of Sonnenschein in 1957. The first AGM cell was the Cyclon, patented by Gates Rubber Corporation in 1972 and now produced by Enersys.The cyclon is a spiral-wound cell with thin lead foil electrodes. A number of manufacturers seized on the technology to implement it in cells with conventional flat plates. In the mid-1980s two UK companies, Chloride and Tungstone, simultaneously introduced 10 year life AGM batteries in capacities up to 400 Ah, stimulated by a British Telecom specification for batteries for support of new digital exchanges. In the same period, Gates acquired another UK company, Varley, specialising in aircraft and military batteries. Varley adapted the Cyclon lead foil technology to produce flat plate batteries with exceptional high rate output. These gained approval {{for a variety of}} aircraft including the BAe 125 and 146 business jets, the Harrier and its derivative the AV8B, and some F16 variants as the first alternatives to the normal NiCd batteries.|$|E
50|$|VRLA Gel and AGM {{batteries}} offer {{several advantages}} compared with VRLA flooded lead acid and conventional standard lead-acid batteries. The battery can be mounted in any position, since the valves only operate on over-pressure faults. Since the battery {{system is designed}} to be recombinant and eliminate the emission of gases on overcharge, room ventilation requirements are reduced, and no acid fume is emitted during normal operation. Flooded cell gas emissions are of little consequence in all but the smallest confined areas, and pose very little threat to a domestic user, so a wet cell battery designed for longevity gives lower costs per kWh. In a <b>gel</b> <b>battery,</b> the volume of free electrolyte that could be released on damage to the case or venting is very small. There is no need (or ability) to check the level of electrolyte or to top up water lost due to electrolysis, reducing inspection and maintenance requirements. Wet cell batteries can be maintained by a self-watering system or by topping up every three months. The requirement to add distilled water is normally caused by overcharging. A well-regulated system should not require top-up more often than every three months.|$|E

30|$|This {{constraint}} on the minimum energy is for classical batteries. In {{the case of}} deep cycle <b>batteries</b> (<b>gel</b> <b>batteries),</b> this constraint could be relaxed, which means that P^d_max could increase up to P^d_max= 0.9 or 0.95. This would allow to decrease the number of required batteries, although the individual cost per battery may increase. In the simulations section in this paper (Section 6.2), we perform an energy dimensioning assuming classical batteries and leave for future research the analysis with other kinds of batteries.|$|R

5000|$|Using a gel {{electrolyte}} {{instead of}} a liquid allows the battery {{to be used in}} different positions without leakage. <b>Gel</b> electrolyte <b>batteries</b> for any position date from 1930s, and even in the late 1920s portable suitcase radio sets allowed the cell vertical or horizontal (but not inverted) due to valve design (see third Edition of Wireless Constructor's Encyclopaedia by Frederick James Camm).

40|$|Energy {{storage devices}} such as {{batteries}} are important elements in many electronic devices. Currently, researchers are seeking to create new electronic devices that are "soft", i. e., bendable and stretchable. However, the batteries that power such devices are still mostly hard structures. In the current thesis, we have attempted to develop a "soft" battery out of hydrogels. Specifically, {{we have made a}} soft version of the Daniell Cell, which is a classic electrochemical cell. Our design involves a hybrid gel composed of three distinct layers. The top and bottom layers are gels swollen with a zinc salt and a copper salt, respectively, while the middle layer is akin to a "salt bridge" between the two. The hybrid gel is made by a polymerization technique developed in our laboratory and it retains good mechanical integrity (i. e., the individual layers do not delaminate). Zinc and copper foils are then attached to the hydrogel, thus creating an overall battery, and its discharge performance is reported. One unique aspect of these <b>gel</b> <b>batteries</b> is that they can be dehydrated and stored in a dry form, whereupon they are no longer batteries. In this inactive state, the materials are safe and light to transport. Upon rehydration, the gels revert to being functional batteries. This concept could be useful for military or other applications where an emergency energy storage is needed...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{advantage}} to the AGM design is that the electrolyte becomes the separator material, and mechanically strong. This allows the plate stack to be compressed together in the battery shell, slightly increasing energy density compared to liquid or <b>gel</b> versions. AGM <b>batteries</b> often show a characteristic [...] "bulging" [...] in their shells when built in common rectangular shapes.|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, Bullock {{rejoined the}} Electrochemical Research Department of the Gates Company. John Devitt's group at Gates {{was working on}} {{development}} of a valve-regulated lead-acid battery (VRLA). Prior {{to the development of}} VRLAs, [...] "flooded" [...] rechargeable lead-acid batteries were used. They were filled with 30-40% sulfuric acid. At 85-90% of their charge capacity, chemical reactions within the battery became less effective, and water in the system was converted into hydrogen and oxygen gases. Flooded batteries could not be sealed, and had to be monitored to ensure effectiveness and prevent problems. In contrast, VRLAs were designed to ensure that oxygen would recombine rather than being lost. VRLAs contain acid inside a silica gel or absorb it into a porous glass separator. Gases that do not recombine are vented through a one-way pressure-release valve. [...] Bullock developed computer models describing the relationships between the circuit voltage of VRLAs and their acid concentration, battery charge and internal temperature. She read widely and was inspired by the work of people like Jeanne Burbank, Paul Ruetschi, and Detchko Pavlov. She studied corrosion within batteries. She examined the effects of adding phosphoric acid to lead dioxide electrodes in <b>gel</b> <b>batteries</b> to increase battery cycle life, resulting in the creation of batteries with low levels of phosphoric acid. In 1977, Bullock joined Globe-Union, Inc. in Milwaukee, where she continued her work with VRLAs. [...] Her work on the effects of adding phosphoric acid to lead dioxide electrodes won her the Battery Division Research Award from the Electrochemical Society in 1980.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This study prospectively {{examined}} {{changes in}} cognition in hypogonadal men given testosterone (T) or older hypogonadal men given dihydrotestosterone (DHT) <b>gel.</b> A <b>battery</b> of cognitive tests assessing verbal and spatial memory, language, and attention was administered at baseline (prior to medication) {{and again at}} days 90 and 180 of treatment for men receiving T gel and at baseline and days 30 and 90 of treatment for men receiving DHT gel. For men receiving T gel, circulating total T and estradiol (E 2) were significantly raised compared with baseline, and a significant improvement in verbal memory was observed. For men receiving DHT gel, serum DHT levels increased and T levels decreased significantly compared with baseline, and a significant improvement in spatial memory was observed. The results suggest that beneficial changes in cognition can occur in hypogonadal men using T replacement levels and DHT treatment, and these changes in cognition can be reliably measured during a relative steady-state dose level. Further, our results suggest that aromatization of T to E 2 may regulate verbal memory in men, whereas nonaromatizable androgens may regulate spatial memory...|$|R

They felt such footage was [...] "the language they were missing", and collectively decided to implement time-lapse {{as a major}} part of the film to create [...] "an experience of acceleration". For the time-lapse footage, Fricke purchased a Mitchell camera, and built a motor with an intervalometer, which was used to precisely move the camera between frames. The system was powered by a <b>gel</b> cell <b>battery</b> that lasted for twelve hours, which enabled Fricke to shoot without the use of a generator. Most time-lapse shots were filmed at a frame rate of 1Â½ frames per second. Fricke wanted the footage to [...] "look normal" [...] and not contain any [...] "gimmicky" [...] special effects. The time-lapse shot overlooking the freeway in Los Angeles was filmed from the top of a building in through a double exposure, with ten-second delay between frames.
