40|$|Model-based {{interface}} development {{works on}} the following central premise: given a declarative <b>interface</b> <b>model</b> that defines all the relevant characteristics of a user interface, then comprehensive, automated, user-interface development environments can be built around such model. Yet, the high potential of this technology has not been realised because all <b>interface</b> <b>models</b> built so far are partial representations of interfaces, cannot be readily modified by developers, are implicitly tied to their associated development environment, or, importantly, are not publicly available to the HCI community. The MECANO Project is a research effort that aims to overcome such limitations. It encompasses two phases: (1) The development of a comprehensive <b>interface</b> <b>model</b> available as a resource to the HCI community, and (2) {{the implementation of a}} open model-based development environment based on such an <b>interface</b> <b>model.</b> In this paper, we report on {{the first phase of the}} project. We present the MECANO <b>Interface</b> <b>Model</b> (MIM), and its associated <b>interface</b> <b>modelling</b> language (MIMIC). We describe a metalevel paradigm for <b>interface</b> <b>modelling</b> that overcomes problems of flexibility and completeness. The paradigm is also unique in that it not only <b>models</b> the user <b>interface</b> but also <b>models</b> explicitly the design process of the interface. This allows the construction of software tools that operate on the design process as well as on the interface elements. MIM has been validated via a variety of paper-based interfaces...|$|R

40|$|MOBI-D (Model-Based Interface Designer) is a {{software}} environment {{the design and}} development of user interfaces from declarative <b>interface</b> <b>models.</b> End-users informally describe tasks and data, from end-users, from which developers construct formal models of user tasks and domain objects.

MOBI-D is the first development environment to define an <b>interface</b> <b>model</b> as a comprehensive conceptual object, to identify an interface design as a declarative component of an <b>interface</b> <b>model,</b> and to establish a development cycle based on such a model.

40|$|International audienceDescribing macro-molecular {{interfaces}} is key {{to improve}} {{our understanding of the}} specificity and of the stability of macro-molecular interactions, and also to predict complexes when little structural information is known. Ideally, an <b>interface</b> <b>model</b> should provide easy-to-compute geometric and topological parameters exhibiting a good correlation with important bio-physical quantities. It should also be parametric and amenable to comparisons. In this spirit, we recently developed an <b>interface</b> <b>model</b> based on Voronoi diagrams, which proved instrumental to refine state-of-the-art conclusions and provide new insights. This paper formally presents this Voronoi <b>interface</b> <b>model.</b> First, we discuss its connexion to classical <b>interface</b> <b>models</b> based on distance cut-offs and solvent accessibility. Second, we develop the geometric and topological constructions underlying the Voronoi interface, and design efficient algorithms based on the Delaunay triangulation and the α-complex. We conclude with perspectives. In particular, we expect the Voronoi <b>interface</b> <b>model</b> to be particularly well suited for the problem of comparing interfaces in the context of large-scale structural studies...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{sociology}} of interactions between the proteins encoded in a genome is a central question of structural biology, and <b>interface</b> <b>models</b> between molecules forming a complex are instrumental in this perspective. Qualifying interface atoms as atoms loosing solvent accessibility in the complex, or pairs of atoms within a distance threshold, several <b>interface</b> <b>models</b> have been proposed. Yet, until recently, no <b>interface</b> <b>model</b> existed to answer coherently (if at all) the following questions: can one bridge the gap from atoms loosing solvent accessibility to interface pairs? is the interface flat or curvy? is it connected or not (does it have a multi-patch structure) ? is a connected component of the interface simply connected or not (does it have a hole) ? what is precisely {{the role played by}} interface structural water? Using the α-complex of the Van der Waals balls, a construction derived from the Voronoi diagram, we designed such an <b>interface</b> <b>model,</b> and validated it on the usual database of co-crystallized protein-protein complexes. This paper is a methodological paper aiming at easing the access of the <b>interface</b> <b>model</b> to structural biologists. As such, the paper overviews: (i) the geometric principles underlying the <b>interface</b> <b>model</b> (ii) the definitions of the interface and its extension to accommodate structural water (iii) the statistics one can compute from the <b>interface</b> <b>model</b> (iv) the Software Intervor and the associated web site.

40|$|The {{convergence}} of a peridynamic model for solid mechanics inside heterogeneous {{media in the}} limit of vanishing nonlocality is analyzed. It is shown that the operator of linear peridynamics for an isotropic heterogeneous medium converges to the corresponding operator of linear elasticity when the material properties are sufficiently regular. On the other hand, when the material properties are discontinuous, i. e., when material interfaces are present, it is shown that the operator of linear peridynamics diverges, {{in the limit of}} vanishing nonlocality, at material interfaces. Nonlocal interface conditions, whose local limit implies the classical interface conditions of elasticity, are then developed and discussed.

Solid/solid interface behavior at the microscale has a strong influence on the strength of structures at the macroscale, such as gluing, optical systems, aircraft tires, pavement layers and masonry, for instance.

40|$|Solid phase microextraction (SPME) {{has gained}} much {{popularity}} for in vivo applications recently. Thus far, {{there are two}} types of pre-equilibrium kinetic calibration that have been applied to in vivo SPME: on-fibre standardization and dominant pre-equilibrium desorption. Both of these techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages. To address the limitations presented by these two techniques, a third pre-equilibrium kinetic calibration method, the diffusion-based <b>interface</b> <b>model,</b> was investigated. The diffusion-based <b>interface</b> <b>model</b> had been successfully applied to air and water samples but was never utilized for in vivo SPME studies. For the first part of the research, on-fibre standardization, dominant pre-equilibrium desorption, and diffusion-based <b>interface</b> <b>model</b> were compared in terms of accuracy, precision, and experimental procedures, by using a flow-through system. These three kinetic calibrations were further validated by equilibrium SPME extraction and protein-plasma precipitation, a current state-of-the-art sampling method. 	The potential of diffusion-based <b>interface</b> <b>model</b> was yet again demonstrated in the second part of the research project. This calibration method was applied to comparative pharmacokinetic studies of two drugs, fenoterol and methoxyfenoterol, on 5 rats.

It custom-written program allowed the entire SPME sampling procedure excluding insertion and removal of SPME probes to be automated.

Further successful comparisons of molecular dynamics results with the predictions of a hybrid model, combining the continuum description of the liquid with the kinetic description of the vapor, suggest that the observed discrepancies can be attributed to poor description of the Knudsen layer provided by the diffuse <b>interface</b> <b>model</b> when the vapor phase is dilute...|$|R
