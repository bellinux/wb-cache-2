5|$|Given an {{adequate}} supply of food, larvae pupate and weave silken cocoons after three larval stages.

This can take <b>just</b> <b>four</b> <b>days,</b> but may take much longer under adverse conditions, and there follows a variable-length stage during which the pre-emergent adult awaits a suitable opportunity to emerge. Trigger factors for emergence include vibrations (including sound), heat (in warm-blooded hosts), and increased levels of carbon dioxide, all of which stimuli may indicate {{the presence of a}} suitable host. Large numbers of pre-emergent fleas may be present in otherwise flea-free environments, and the introduction of a suitable host may trigger a mass emergence.|$|E

Orton argued that this could potentially end his career. According to Anderson, Randy Orton also persuaded his friend and fellow wrestler John Cena to complain to Vince McMahon about Anderson's in ring performance, which prompted McMahon to release Kennedy from his contract.|$|E
