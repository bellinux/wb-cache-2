5|$|The {{accident}} {{was the fifth}} <b>fatal</b> <b>accident</b> with a Twin Otter in Norway and the fourth <b>fatal</b> <b>accident</b> by Widerøe in eleven years. The company's executive management met in Bodø {{the evening of the}} accident before chief executive officer Bård Mikkelsen and others traveled to Namsos to investigate the crash site of the third <b>fatal</b> <b>accident</b> since Mikkelsen started in his position in 1988. Widerøe stopped all advertisements in the period after the accident. Widerøe announced in November that they would accelerate the replacement of their Twin Otter and de Havilland Canada Dash 7 aircraft with new de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft, but denied that the accident influenced the decision and instead cited financial reasons. Widerøe's chief operating officer, Per-Helge Røbekk, announced in July 1994 that he would step down because of the strain of the three accidents.|$|E

40|$|In the United States, an {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} tighter fuel efficiency requirements that leads to lighter vehicle bodies would cause {{an increase in the}} number of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents.</b> However, other recent work argues that fuel economy is not relevant to the occurrence rate of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents.</b> This research is aimed at examining the relationship between vehicle characteristics including fuel economy and the occurrence rate of accidents in Japan. Traditionally, the safety of passenger cars has been assessed through the use of laboratory data from the viewpoint of risk of death and injury under the assumption that accidents have already occurred and results have been published in New Car Assessment. On the other hand, we examined safety from the perspective of the occurrence rate of accidents resulting in death (<b>fatal</b> <b>accidents)</b> and accidents resulting in injury or death (hereinafter “accidents”). We conducted negative binominal regression analyses of the occurrence rates of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> and accidents, taking into consideration the influence of driver-related factors, and vehicle characteristics. The results of our analysis demonstrate that there was no important difference in the adjusted occurrence rates of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> and accidents, which excluded the effects of driver-related characteristics, among vehicle types other than minivans and sport and specialty cars. In addition, the adjusted occurrence rate of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> was not strongly correlated with the score in New Car Assessment. While the adjusted occurrence rate of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> exhibited a tendency to decrease inversely with the increase in the weight of the vehicle, we obtained an opposite result for sport and specialty cars, which have an adjusted high occurrence rate of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents.</b> There is the possibility that the interior volume or the vehicle shape has a greater influence on the occurrence rate of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents...</b>|$|R

40|$|This conference paper {{presents}} an accident study investigating where fatal alcohol- and drug-related accidents occur {{with respect to}} traffic environment (i. e., urban versus rural), road type, speed limit, annual average daily traffic flow, and road category. The study uses data from in-depth studies of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> and from the Swedish National Road Database. Accident data from the 2006 – 2009 period are used. The {{results indicate that the}} proportion of all <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> that are alcohol-related is about the same on urban (21 %) and rural roads (23 %). However, the proportion of alcohol-related <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> is higher on ordinary roads (i. e., two-lane single carriageways with no central reservation or median barrier; 23 %) than on other types of rural state roads (11 %). On ordinary roads, alcohol-related <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> are more common on roads with speed limits of 60 – 70 km/h (35 %) than on roads with speed limits of 80 – 100 km/h (14 %) and more common on second- and third-class county roads (32 %) than on roads in other categories (less than 20 %). The alcohol-related accident risk follows the same pattern, i. e., the accident risk is highest where the proportion of alcohol-related accidents is highest.  It was also found that the distribution of drug-related <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> among various parts of the road network is more similar to the distribution of <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents</b> involving sober drivers than to alcohol-related <b>fatal</b> <b>accidents.</b> The present results can be used by the police in strategic planning of the surveillance. ...|$|R

5|$|Collyer Monument is an {{historic}} monument to firefighters in Mineral Spring Park, {{at the corner}} of Mineral Spring Avenue and Main Street, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, United States. The monument was built in 1890 by the sculptor Charles Parker Dowler to honor Samuel Smith Collyer, a fallen Pawtucket Fire Chief. The life-size bronze sculpture stands atop a pedestal of Westerly granite which contains a bronze plaque showing the <b>fatal</b> <b>accident</b> and the reverse bears the inscription. The Collyer Monument represents a significant example of monumental work of the period and an early example of local civic pride. The monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|In September 1956, the RAF {{received}} its first Vulcan B.1, XA897, which immediately embarked upon a round-the-world tour.

5|$|Construction of the Sloatsburg station {{dates back}} to the 1830s, when the station was built along the Erie Railroad. The station served the line heading to Port Jervis northward, along with a stagecoach to Greenwood Lake three times a day.

These calamities include a derailed milk train in 1843 and a <b>fatal</b> <b>accident</b> between the train line and several mules and their owner in 1855.

5|$|In New Zealand, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances and traded the lead with Mikkola, Röhrl and Björn Waldegård. Soon after regaining {{the lead on}} stage twelve, she retired with a broken oil pump. After seven rounds, Mouton was second in the championship, 32 points behind Röhrl and 12 ahead of Eklund. The Rally of Brazil was marred by the <b>fatal</b> <b>accident</b> of Brazilian driver Thomas Fuchs, and featured chaotic conditions as parts of the course were not successfully closed for competition. Although only five teams {{made it to the}} finish, Mouton improved her title hopes by winning her duel with Röhrl after the German lost a wheel on the last day. At the 1000 Lakes, she clocked in the eighth fastest time for the famous Ouninpohja stage and placed seventh after the first day. On the following leg, Mouton drove too fast into a jump and damaged her Quattro while landing. After the next jump, her front wheels locked up and she rolled the car. Mouton was next locked in a tight battle for the win in Sanremo. Although she recorded nine stage wins and Audi took a one-two, she had to settle for fourth behind Röhrl.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 1990, 24 F-4G Wild Weasel Vs and six RF-4Cs were {{deployed}} to Shaikh Isa AB, Bahrain, for Operation Desert Storm. The F-4G {{was the only}} aircraft in the USAF inventory equipped for the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role, and was needed to protect coalition aircraft from Iraq's extensive air defense system. The RF-4C was the only aircraft equipped with the ultra-long-range KS-127 LOROP (long-range oblique photography) camera, and was used {{for a variety of}} reconnaissance missions. In spite of flying almost daily missions, only one RF-4C was lost in a <b>fatal</b> <b>accident</b> before the start of hostilities. One F-4G was lost when enemy fire damaged the fuel tanks and the aircraft ran out of fuel near a friendly airbase. The last USAF Phantoms, F-4G Wild Weasel Vs from 561st Fighter Squadron, were retired on 26 March 1996. The last operational flight of the F-4G Wild Weasel was from the 190th Fighter Squadron, Idaho Air National Guard, in April 1996. The last operational USAF/ANG F-4 to land was flown by Maj Mike Webb and Maj Gary Leeder of the Idaho ANG.|$|E
