5|$|The couch gag was {{suggested}} by Dan Castellaneta's niece. The film True Lies was {{the inspiration for}} the bus crashing against the bridge. To get the fisherman's Chinese correct, Cohen called his friend. When the Chinese actors came, the actors felt Cantonese would be more appropriate for the fisherman than Mandarin, so it was changed. Moe was picked to rescue the children, because the writers thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny.</b> They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E
25|$|Humphrey Lyttelton, {{primarily}} {{known as}} a jazz trumpeter and bandleader, was invited to be chairman because of {{the role played by}} improvisation in both comedy and jazz music. In the first series Lyttelton shared the role of chairman with Barry Cryer but he made it his own (especially once Cryer replaced Cleese as a regular panellist) and continued as chairman until his death on 25 April 2008. He read the script introducing the programme and segments in an utterly deadpan manner. He claimed the secret was just to read what was in front of him without understanding why <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny.</b> He adopted the grumpy persona of someone who would really rather be somewhere else, which he attributed to worrying that, surrounded by four professional comedians, he would have nothing worthwhile to chip in. He did occasionally depart from the script, however, often bringing the house down with an ad-lib. He was credited by the regular panellists as being the chief reason for the show's longevity.|$|E

[...] "Fishsticks" [...] received largely positive reviews, and generated {{a great deal of}} media attention when West wrote in a blog that the episode hurt his feelings, although he said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> and admitted that he needed to work on his ego problem. The episode also spoofed comedian Carlos Mencia, who praised the episode after it was broadcast.|$|E
500|$|L. Frank Baum's first {{published}} short story was [...] "They Played a New Hamlet" [...] (1895). When Baum had been touring New York State {{in the title}} role, the actor playing the ghost fell through the floorboards, and the rural audience thought {{it was part of}} the show and demanded that the actor repeat the fall, because they thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny.</b> Baum would later recount the actual story in an article, but the short story is told from the point of view of the actor playing the ghost.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the scenes}} {{were based on the}} actor's real-life talents as well as improvised. When Michael tells Pam to [...] "write this down", Jenna Fischer's {{response}} to the camera was improvised. [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> that I didn't have a pad of paper but Michael was telling me to take notes," [...] she explained in her MySpace blog, [...] "so I just looked to the camera and showed my lack of pen and paper." [...] Jim's impression of Stanley in this episode was inspired by John Krasinski's actual talent of doing impressions on the set.|$|E

500|$|A deleted {{scene from}} the season five episode [...] "Burns' Heir" [...] is also shown, in which a robotic Richard Simmons dances outside Burns's mansion to the 1976 song [...] "(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty". It was cut from [...] "Burns' Heir" [...] because the writers did not think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny,</b> nor did it do well with a test audience, {{although}} Oakley thought the animation was terrific. To the production staff's surprise, the scene would make the audience [...] "erupt with laughter" [...] when screened at animation conventions and college presentations, {{so they decided to}} insert it in this episode.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{some heavy}} {{promotion}} the black comedy approach {{was not what}} audiences wanted to see, especially with Paul Lynde. As a result, the ratings for the series fell well below the levels of the previous season. The last of The New Temperatures Rising Shows thirteen episodes aired on January 8, 1974. The following Tuesday, January 15, ABC premiered Happy Days in its place. According to co-producer Mitchell, [...] "...the audience didn't buy that at all. They just didn't get it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> if you like black comedy, but if you don't it would disturb you. So the show failed miserably and we lost the job and the show." ...|$|E

She is nicknamed Bird because her friend Kate Dunstan in high school thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> that her name sounded like Bird. Then, when {{she moved to the}} United States, her friends struggled to pronounce her first name correctly – it rhymes with [...] "tidy" [...] – when she was living there. [...] And so, the nickname stuck. Her hometown is Parkdale, Victoria.

I {{wanted to do}} a continuation and I {{wanted to do a}}n album that went even further and that was more extreme, if possible, which a lot of people felt wasn't possible but I just wanted to see if I could make a record that was even more heroic because that's what I thought of it ... Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> ... and I wanted to do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{live action}} was a {{stepping}} stone for Pixar, as Stanton was planning to make John Carter of Mars his next project. Storyboarder Derek Thompson noted introducing live action meant that they would make {{the rest of the}} film look even more realistic. Eggleston added that if the historical humans had been animated and slightly caricaturized, the audience then {{would not have been able}} to recognize how serious their devolution was. Stanton cast Fred Willard as the historical Buy n Large CEO because [...] "e's the most friendly and insincere car salesman I could think of." [...] The CEO says [...] "stay the course", which Stanton used because he thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny.</b> Industrial Light & Magic did the visual effects for these shots.|$|E
500|$|The dark, ironic {{lyrics of}} [...] "Today", {{describing}} {{a day when}} Corgan was feeling depressed and suicidal, contrast with the instrumentation. Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the song is [...] "downright pretty as rock ballads go" [...] but that [...] "Corgan manages to convey the exhilaration and tragic release he seeks." [...] Corgan told Rolling Stone that [...] "I was really suicidal... I just thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> to write a song that said today is the greatest day of your life because it can't get any worse." [...] Corgan later compared writing the lyrics of [...] "Today" [...] and [...] "Disarm" [...] to [...] "ripping [...] guts out."

500|$|... "Andy and April's Fancy Party" [...] {{was written}} by Katie Dippold and {{directed}} by Michael Trim. It is referred to simply as [...] "Fancy Party" [...] in some publications. During a break between {{the development of the}} first six episodes of the season and the remaining episodes, the writing staff was contemplating what direction they should take with the romantic relationship between Andy and April. Parks co-creator Michael Schur said they wanted to avoid the [...] "standard-issue TV romance plots: fights, other men/women driving them apart, and so on". They decided the two should get married after dating for only a short time because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny,</b> it made sense with the characters' personalities, and it raised the stakes for future stories involving the two. Schur said: [...] "We just thought about who they were [...] two impulsive goofballs who don’t approach their lives in a responsible, adult manner [...] and decided, what the hell? What if they just make a rash decision and get hitched?" ...|$|E
500|$|Kreuk {{enjoyed the}} fourth season {{because it gave}} her the chance to stretch her acting {{abilities}} with Lana's storyline involving the spirit of Countess Margaret Isobel Thoreaux. According to the actress, [...] "That {{was a lot of}} fun; I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> as well [...] It really was wonderful to be able to stretch and play this driven woman who has a goal and is going to reach it, and in the meantime she's going to be sexy doing it. That {{was a lot of fun}} for me because the show [...] isn't realistic so, as actors, we get to play with different types of things." [...] Kreuk says her strangest moment on the show was playing a vampire in season five's [...] "Thirst", an experience she remembers as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] due to the fake blood they covered her in. Kreuk left the series at the end of the seventh season, but appeared in five episodes in season eight as a guest star.|$|E
500|$|Shearer is {{also known}} for his {{prolific}} work as a voice actor on The Simpsons. Matt Groening, {{the creator of the}} show, was a fan of Shearer's work, while Shearer was a fan of a column Groening used to write. Shearer was asked if he {{wanted to be in the}} series, but he was initially reluctant because he thought the recording sessions would be too much trouble. He felt voice acting was [...] "not a lot of fun" [...] because traditionally, voice actors record their parts separately. He was told that the actors would record their lines together and after three calls, executive producer James L. Brooks managed to convince Shearer to join the cast. Shearer's first impression of The Simpsons was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny.</b> Shearer, who thought it was a [...] "pretty cool" [...] way to work, found it peculiar that the members of the cast were adamant about not being known to the public as the people behind the voices.|$|E

500|$|Engineering of {{the song}} was done by Emily Wright and Sam Holland at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. While Kesha was {{in the studio with}} Dr. Luke and Blanco, she took three takes to get the song correct as she jokingly [...] "white-girl rapped" [...] over the beat. At one point in the song's production, she had wanted to re-write the verses {{of the song}} because she did not think that they were [...] "funny or clever", feeling that they [...] "kind of sucked." [...] She elaborated, [...] "I thought it was just another song, I thought it was just like all the other ones I'd written. I didn't even know if it was very good. I wanted to rewrite the verses, I didn't think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> or clever. I thought it kind of sucked. But {{everyone}} else liked it." [...] Kesha ultimately did not end up rewriting any of the song's lyrics. She further described the theme of the song in an interview, emphasizing that it embodied her own lifestyle, ...|$|E
500|$|Ikumi created other girl–animal {{combinations}} while {{designing the}} four other Mew Mews, including a mouse girl with the same green coloring as Retasu. However, the mouse design {{was one of several}} designs rejected for use in the series as the choices were narrowed down. Once the main Mew Mew designs were finalized, Ikumi named them after various foods: Ichigo (Strawberry), Minto (Mint), Retasu (Lettuce), Bu-Ling (Pudding), and Zakuro (Pomegranate). During one of the project meetings, an unnamed editor remarked that the names might be hard to remember and suggested naming the characters after various colors instead, but the food names were kept. Although Ikumi initially suggested calling Ichigo's main attack [...] "Strawberry Bell Bell" [...] as a joke, the editorial team thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> and kept the name. Ikumi noted that future attack names were decided by which sounded funniest. The only character from Ikumi's Tokyo Black Cat Girl to retain his original name and general appearance was Masha, but his gender was changed to female in Tokyo Mew Mew.|$|E
500|$|Mendes {{encouraged}} some improvisation; for example, when Lester masturbates in {{bed beside}} Carolyn, the director asked Spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take. Mendes said, [...] "I wanted that {{not just because}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>funny</b> but because I didn't want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it to seem like he was blurting {{it out of his}} mouth without thinking. [...] is so in control—I wanted him to break through." [...] Spacey obliged, eventually coming up with 35 phrases, but Bening could not always keep a straight face, which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times. The production used small amounts of computer-generated imagery. Most of the rose petals in Lester's fantasies were added in post-production, although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed. When Lester fantasizes about Angela in a rose-petal bath, the steam was real, save for in the overhead shot. To position the camera, a hole had to be cut in the ceiling, through which the steam escaped; it was instead added digitally.|$|E
