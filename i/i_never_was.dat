He himself has credited this tendency to his lack of musical knowledge, stating: [...] "I'm a professional listener. I listen and I react. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> a musician, so I don't bring any preconceived prejudices to the table; I don't favour the guitar over the keyboard, and so forth.

[...] "I told ya the New York Dolls were the real thing," [...] he wrote, describing the album as [...] "perhaps {{the best example}} of raw, thumb-your-nose-at-the-world, punk rock since the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street." [...] Bassist Jeff Jensen of Boston's Real Kids reports of a show that year, [...] "A reviewer for one of the free entertainment magazines of the time caught the act and gave us a great review, calling us a 'punk band.'... e all sort of {{looked at each other and}} said, 'What's punk?'"

500|$|Blanchard {{was born}} on December 11, 1924 in McColl, South Carolina [...] His father was a doctor and had played college {{football}} at Tulane University and Wake Forest University. The Blanchards moved from McColl, South Carolina to Dexter, Iowa in 1929. [...] The Blanchards then moved to Bishopville, South Carolina two years later. [...] Blanchard, nicknamed [...] "Little Doc" [...] due to his father's occupation, attended high school at Saint Stanislaus College in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. He led the school's football team, the Rockachaws, to an undefeated season during his senior year in 1941. Blanchard was recruited to play college football by Army, Fordham University and the University of Notre Dame, among others. Blanchard said in 1985 {{that he had been}} contacted about going to West Point when he was in high school. He said, [...] "At that point in time, I really wasn’t interested.

500|$|In 1798, Methodist ministers {{arrived in}} Hinde's {{neighborhood}} {{and began to}} convert people. Susanna, one of Hinde's daughters, converted, causing distress to the family. Hinde banished her from his home, {{and she went to}} live with her aunt forty miles away. However, this failed because the aunt had already converted, and Hinde's wife converted soon after. Hinde became convinced that the disorder was in their heads, and treated them with medical procedures of the day, such as a [...] "blistering plaster to the whole length of the spine, which he left on for several days". Drake states that, through this [...] "measure of violence, he hoped to deter her from further attendance at places of public worship". The procedures were painful, but his wife stated afterwards that [...] "it was a punishment, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> so happy in all my life". Hinde later felt guilt for having banished his daughter and performed medical operations on his wife, and he converted to Methodism. His daughter returned home and his wife began attending Methodist gatherings regularly. Two of his daughters married traveling preachers, and another daughter converted to Methodism too. By the end of his life, Hinde was a devout Methodist. According to one account: ...|$|E

2500|$|Waters {{was born}} in Chester, Pennsylvania, on October 31, 1896, {{as a result of}} the rape of her teenaged mother, Louise Anderson (believed to have been 13 years old at the time, {{although}} some sources indicate she may have been slightly older), by John Waters, a pianist and family acquaintance from a mixed-race middle-class background. He played no role in raising Ethel. Soon after she was born, her mother married Norman Howard, a railroad worker. Ethel used the surname Howard as a child, before reverting to her father's name. She was raised in poverty by her grandmother, Sally Anderson, who worked as a housemaid, along with two of her aunts and an uncle. Waters never lived in the same place for more than 15 months. She said of her difficult childhood, [...] "I never was a child. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> cuddled, or liked, or understood by my family." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{problems}} the Opera of the Nobility was causing {{him at the}} time, Handel's neighbour in Brook Street, Mary Delany, reported on a party she invited Handel to at her house on 12 April 1734 where he was in good spirits:I had Lady Rich and her daughter, Lady Cath. Hanmer and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Percival, Sir John Stanley and my brother, Mrs. Donellan, Strada [...] and Mr. Coot. [...] Lord Shaftesbury begged of Mr. Percival to bring him, and being a profess'd friend of Mr. Handel (who was here also) was admitted; <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> so well entertained at an opera! [...] Mr. Handel {{was in the best}} humour in the world, and played lessons and accompanied Strada and all the ladies that sang from seven o'clock till eleven.

2500|$|During {{a period}} of the game's history when betting and match-fixing was rife, Beldham was not immune to the lure of easy money. When interviewed by Pycroft in the late 1830s, he said: [...] "You may hear that I sold matches. I will confess I once was sold myself by two men, one of whom would not bowl, and the other would not bat, his best, and lost ten pounds. The next match, at Nottingham, I joined in selling, and got my money back. But for this once, I could say <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> bought {{in my life and}} this was not for want of offers from C and other turfmen, though often I must have been accused. For where it was worth while to buy, no man could keep a character; because to be out without runs or to miss a catch was, by the {{disappointed}} betting-men, deemed proof as strong as Holy Writ".|$|E
2500|$|Newly {{arrived in}} Rome, Ingres read with {{mounting}} indignation the relentlessly negative press clippings {{sent to him}} from Paris by his friends.

The scoundrels, they waited until I was away to assassinate my reputation... I have never been so unhappy....I knew I had many enemies; <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> agreeable with them and never will be. My greatest wish would be to fly to the Salon and to confound them with my works, which don't in any way resemble theirs; [...] and the more I advance, the less their work will resemble mine." [...] He vowed never again to exhibit at the Salon, and his refusal to return to Paris led to the breaking up of his engagement. Julie Forestier, when asked years later why she had never married, responded, [...] "When one has had the honor of being engaged to M. Ingres, one does not marry." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lacking the {{photogenic}} {{looks of}} many of his rock and roll contemporaries, Orbison eventually developed a persona that did not reflect his personality. He had no publicist in the early 1960s, no presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. Life magazine called him an [...] "anonymous celebrity". After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an airplane in 1963 while on tour with the Beatles, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. His biographers suggest that although he had {{a good sense of humor}} and was never morose, Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe stage fright; wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat from the attention. The ever-present sunglasses led some people to assume, then and now, that the stationary performer was blind. The black clothes and desperation in his songs led to an aura of mystery and introversion. Years later Orbison said, [...] "I wasn't trying to be weird, you know? I didn't have a manager who told me to dress or how to present myself or anything. But the image developed of a man of mystery and a quiet man in black somewhat of a recluse, although <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>was,</b> really." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Darwin proved {{unable to}} persevere at medical studies, his father {{sent him to}} Christ's College, Cambridge, for a Bachelor of Arts degree {{as the first step}} towards {{becoming}} an Anglican parson. Darwin was at first uncertain, he later wrote: [...] "from what little I had heard and thought on the subject I had scruples about declaring my belief in all the dogmas of the Church of England; though otherwise I liked the thought of being a country clergyman. Accordingly I read with care 'Pearson on the Creed' and a few other books on divinity; and as I did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself that our Creed must be fully accepted. It never struck me how illogical it was to say that I believed in what I could not understand and what is in fact unintelligible. I might have said with entire truth that I had no wish to dispute any dogma; but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> such a fool as to feel and say 'credo quia incredibile'. He was particularly convinced by the reasoning of the Revd. John Bird Sumner's Evidences of Christianity which set out the logic that the unbelief of sceptics gave them the dilemma that if Christianity were untrue, then either [...] "Jesus did not live, or he actually lived, but was not the Son of God, hence an imposter." [...] The Gospels made this highly improbable, as his miracles had convinced unbelievers, hence we had [...] "no right to deny" [...] that such events were probable. Jesus's religion was [...] "wonderfully suitable... to our ideas of happiness in this & the next world" [...] and there was [...] "no other way... of explaining the series of evidence & probability." ...|$|E
