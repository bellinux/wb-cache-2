In the mid-1960s, the American Football League (AFL), which had formed to compete against the NFL, put a new franchise in Cincinnati. Brown was the third-largest investor in the team and was given the title of coach and general manager. He was also given the right to represent the team in all league matters, a key element of control for Brown.|$|E
5|$|In late April, after City won 1–0 against Sheffield Wednesday {{and title}} rivals Manchester United lost to West Bromwich Albion, City were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> winning their final three games would all but {{guarantee}} the championship. In {{the first of}} the three, a home match against Everton, City won 2–0 in a match featuring Tony Book's first league goal for the club. Next was Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. City took a 3–0 lead before half time, eventually winning 3–1.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem with}} {{enforcing}} a close blockade with ships was that warships loitering {{off the coast}} of Japan would be vulnerable to attack by aircraft and submarines. Blockading Japanese ports with small ships was a possibility, but this would first require the destruction or neutralisation of the Japanese fleet, and it was far from certain that the Japanese fleet would place itself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> it could be destroyed. A plan was adopted for a more distant blockade, whereby ships bound for Japan would be intercepted as they passed through the East Indies or the Panama Canal. This would not cut off Japan's trade with China or Korea, and probably not with the United States either. The effectiveness of such a blockade was therefore questionable.|$|E

5|$|By July 1945 the Imperial Japanese Navy's (IJN's) {{remaining}} large warships {{were unable}} to put to sea due to shortages of fuel and the dangers of attack from Allied aircraft and submarines. While most of these warships were anchored near the major naval base at Kure and other locations in the Seto Inland Sea, Nagato and several smaller warships were stationed at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in Tokyo Bay. At this time the battleship was moored alongside a pier facing northwest and covered in camouflage that was intended to make her difficult for aircraft to spot. All of Nagatos secondary armament and about half her anti-aircraft guns had been removed and emplaced on nearby hills from where they could provide protection to the naval base. Although the battleship's boilers were not lit, she received steam and power from the submarine chaser Fukugawa Maru No.7 and an auxiliary boiler located on the pier. The destroyer Ushio was also docked nearby <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> {{she was able to}} protect the battleship with her 25mm anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack {{by one or}} two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E

25|$|Structural {{adjustment}} programmes (SAPs) {{implemented by}} the World Bank and IMF are viewed by some postcolonialists as the modern procedure of colonization. Structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) calls for trade liberalization, privatization of banks, health care, and educational institutions. These implementations minimized government's role, paved pathways for companies to enter Africa for its resources. Limited to production and exportation of cash crops, many African nations acquired more debt, and were left stranded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> acquiring more loan and continuing to pay high interest became an endless cycle.|$|E

25|$|The Sydney Roosters {{entered the}} Grand Final from a {{markedly}} different path {{to that of}} the Dragons. The Roosters had finished the 2009 season {{on the bottom of the}} ladder. Under new coach Brian Smith, and having signed troubled star Todd Carney, the Roosters improved to finish sixth on the ladder in 2010, before consecutive finals series victories against the Wests Tigers, the Penrith Panthers and the Gold Coast Titans launched the club into the Grand Final. The Roosters were thus <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>where</b> they could become the first club since the Western Suburbs Magpies in 1934 to win a premiership after finishing last in the previous season.|$|E

Because there were no Australian survivors, Burnett's decision is inexplicable; writers on the subject can only speculate on his reasoning, and indicate what factors they believe influenced him. Up until the 1980s, most of the material published relating {{to the loss of}} Sydney accepted the German interpretation of events (that Burnett was deceived by Kormorans disguise, and placed his ship in a tactically unsound position) and assigned Burnett various levels of blame {{for his role in the}} cruiser's demise.|$|E

If, however, Wellington {{had been unable to}} maintain his ground against Ney, and Napoleon had in this manner succeeded in beating both armies in detail; or, if the Prussian defeat had been followed up by a vigorous pursuit, the loss of the Battle of Ligny might have placed both armies in a critical position.|$|E

25|$|In 294 BC the Samnites raided three Roman armies (one {{was meant}} to return to Etruria, one to defend the border and the third to raid Campania).

The other consul, Lucius Postumius Megellus, who was recovering from illness, assembled an army of allies at Sora, where Roman foragers had been pushed back by the Samnites, and the Samnites retreated. Lucius Postumius went on to take Milionia and Feritrum, two unidentified Samnite towns.|$|E

In 1539 the south aisle was added, which incorporated the Boydell chapel. The south porch was added in 1641 and at this time the west wall was strengthened. In 1833 {{the roof of the}} nave was raised to form a clerestory and in the 1850s the south aisle was further extended, and a vestry was built.
