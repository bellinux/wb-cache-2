Its drawing methods {{lay the foundation for}} drawing other ruled surfaces, such as cones, with dual space drawing methods. In this paper, new methods are introduced for <b>drawing</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The underlying principle of these methods is the application and extension (variation) of the dual De Casteljau algorithm [11]. Based on this, a comprehensive study is carried out for the creation of cylinders. The dual De Casteljau algorithm is adjusted by adding boundary conditions to <b>draw</b> <b>cylinders</b> with smooth closed trajectories. The dual space drawing methods of the circular cylinder with boundary conditions and segment construction are also discussed. Rena Din...|$|R

The problems are related with the combing of the feeding system where the combing cylinder damages the fibres producing breakage. In this study, combing system based on <b>drawing</b> <b>cylinder</b> and nipping by aprons is studied. The drawing is carried out noncontinueusly by nipping. The results obtained are {{compared with those of}} the pressure combing cylinder and flat feeding. It is shown that in the system of combing through drawing, a more uniform combing of the wool sliver is obtained as compared to the pressure combing cylinder system. It is also less sensitive to the type of finish employed. The yarns obtained have relatively high tenacity and are more regular than those spun by conventional woolen system. They can be considered quite suitable for Ladies wear and knitted fabrics...|$|R

40|$|Repetition {{occurs in}} many forms and on many {{different}} levels in American popular music, particularly soul, funk, and other dance-based genres. However, the most important use of repetition, aside from its role in creating form, is the repetition of characteristic musical figures referred to as “grooves. ” Grooves {{can be divided into}} two groups, according to the mechanism by which their repetition occurs: An autotelic groove (from “auto,” or self, and “telos,” or goal) is one that strongly progresses toward its own beginning. That is, by some means it causes the listener to expect the beginning of the groove to follow its ending. Autotelic grooves are naturally cyclical. Exotelic grooves, however, do not progress toward their own beginnings, so they are not inherently cyclical. Autotelic grooves thus create a much more natural sense of flow when they are repeated than do exotelic grooves. This paper presents analyses of several autotelic <b>grooves</b> <b>drawn</b> from the music of Stevie Wonder: “I Wish” (1976), which is built around a two-measure bass ostinato; a harmonic progression from “Golden Lady” (1973); the two-measure electric piano part that forms the basis of “Living for the City” (1973); and the complex of clavinets and synthesized bass from “Higher Ground” (1973) ...|$|R

50|$|As {{the engine}} rpm increases, back {{pressure}} rises abruptly, generating higher turbulence and degrading {{exhaust gas flow}} characteristics.

5000|$|Some early {{gas engines}} {{worked on the}} [...] "vacuum" [...] or [...] "atmospheric" [...] {{principle}} {{in a similar way}} to the Newcomen steam engine. A mixture of gas and air was <b>drawn</b> into the <b>cylinder</b> and ignited; the mixture expanded and part of it escaped through the exhaust valve; the valve then closed, the mixture cooled and contracted, and atmospheric pressure pushed the piston in. Such engines were very inefficient and were superseded by engines working on the Otto cycle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{engine was}} invented by Thomas Newcomen in 1712, often referred to simply as a Newcomen engine.

It was the first practical device to harness steam to produce mechanical work. [...] Newcomen engines were used throughout Britain and Europe, principally to pump water out of mines.
