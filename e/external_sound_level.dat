40|$|Objective. To {{elucidate}} {{capabilities and}} limitations of the VocaLog, a device marketed to log-calibrated dB sound pressure level (SPL). Study Design. The study design varied depending on the experiment. All were prospective. Some were case series, and others were cohort studies without controls. Method. Experiments were conducted to determine (1) whether the VocaLog logged phonatory activity and silence when it should, (2) if nonphonatory activities were detected, (3) correlation of VocaLog dB values to an <b>external</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> meter (SLM), and (4) accuracy of phonation time (PT) and speaking time (ST) estimates from the VocaLog. Results. Silence and phonatory activity were logged as such nearly 100 % of the time. Nonphonatory activities were sometimes detected as dB values, including coughs, throat clear, belching, and swallows. The dB values from the VocaLog were strongly correlated with dB SPL from an external SLM. When on the neck, the device rarely picked up external sounds when the external noise was between 85 and 103 dB SPL. The VocaLog gave a reasonable estimate of ST but overestimated PT. Conclusions. Overall, the VocaLog holds promise as means of indexing vocal loudness via calibrated dBSPL levels. However, some nonphonatory activity {{is also likely to}} be logged. The device provides a reasonable estimate of ST, but not PT...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic and {{turbulent}} {{boundary layer}} flow loadings over a flexible structure are used to study the spatial-temporal dynamics of {{the response of the}} structure. The stability of the spatial synchronization and desynchronization by an active external force is investigated with an array of coupled transducers on the structure. In the synchronous state, the structural phase is locked, which leads to the formation of spatial patterns while the amplitude peaks exhibit chaotic behaviors. Large amplitude, spatially symmetric loading is superimposed on broadband, but in the desynchronized state, the spectrum broadens and the phase space is lost. The resulting pattern bears a striking resemblance to phase turbulence. The transition is achieved by using a low power external actuator to trigger broadband behaviors from the knowledge of the external acoustic load inducing synchronization. The changes are made favorably and efficiently to alter the frequency distribution of power, not the total power level. Before synchronization effects are seen, the panel response to the {{turbulent boundary layer}} loading is discontinuously spatiotemporally correlated. The stability develops from different competing wavelengths; the spatial scale is significantly shorter than when forced with the superimposed external sound. When the <b>external</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> decreases and the synchronized phases are lost, changes in the character of the spectra can be linked to the occurrence of spatial phase transition. These changes can develop broadband response. Synchronized responses of fuselage structure panels have been observed in subsonic and supersonic aircraft; results from two flights tests are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Buildings {{located near}} {{airports}} may {{be subjected to}} significant noise levels due to aircraft flyovers. Aircraft noise is particularly annoying {{when compared to other}} traffic noises due to its intermittent nature. While noise control is typically performed at the source, sound insulation programs are in place to improve the acoustic performance of a residence affected by the flyovers. Noise Level Reduction (NLR) is a common metric used in the United States to determine whether a residence qualifies for such programs. Sound insulation programs are available to houses that have an indoor Day Night Average <b>Sound</b> <b>Level</b> (DNL) greater than 45 dBA. NLR is a single-number metric used to quantify the ability for a building or building element to reduce the transmission of <b>external</b> <b>sound</b> pressure <b>levels</b> generated by aircraft. In addition to determining whether a residence qualifies, NLR can be used to quantify the effectiveness of the modifications performed {{as a result of the}} sound insulation program. NLR measurements with a loudspeaker offer an alternative method to those performed with aircraft flyovers, offering flexibility to the consultants that perform these measurements in the field. The purpose of this research was to better understand and improve the loudspeaker test for measuring NLR, providing a resource to the aircraft noise industry. Testing was completed on a "test house" that was constructed on campus with construction methods typical of a mixed-humid climate. The angular dependency, repeatability, and reproducibility of NLR, among other factors, were evaluated with field measurements. Significant NLR variations were observed with changes in lateral and vertical angles of incidence. M. S...|$|R

40|$|During the {{lift-off}} of {{a launch}} vehicle, the acoustic pressure fluctuations {{caused by the}} engine exhaust gases produce high noise levels inside the cavity of the fairing and can damage the payload inside the fairing. Hence reducing the noise transmitted into the payload bay is an important area of research. Work presented in this thesis investigates the external acoustic pressure excitations on the fairing of a launch vehicle during the lift-off acoustic environment. In particular, it investigates the <b>external</b> <b>sound</b> pressure <b>levels</b> in the low frequency range from 50 Hz to 400 Hz, on the fairing during the lift-off of a launch vehicle. This study establishes theoretical and numerical models for the prediction of <b>external</b> <b>sound</b> pressure loading on composite structures representing launch vehicles, such as a large composite cylinder {{referred to as a}} Boeing cylinder and a Representative Small Launch Vehicle Fairing (RSLVF). To predict the <b>external</b> <b>sound</b> pressure loading, various incident wave conditions were investigated, including incident plane waves, oblique plane waves and oblique plane waves with random phases that strike the circumference of the composite structures. For the theoretical model, both the incident and scattered sound pressure fields due to incident plane waves; perpendicular to an idealised long cylinder were investigated. The results show that the scattered sound pressure field {{plays a major role in}} determining the total circumferential sound pressure field at the surface of the cylinder and cannot be ignored for the launch case. The theoretical model was developed further for a point source, line source and oblique incident waves, and modified to determine the incident, scattered and total sound pressure fields away from the cylinder. The approach developed overcomes some limitations of previous analytical derivations. An experiment was undertaken to determine the sound pressure patterns at the surface of a cylinder at various frequencies due to a point source positioned at a finite distance from the cylinder surface. The experimental work confirmed the accuracy of the theoretical model for a point source at a finite distance from the cylinder. The Boundary Element Method (BEM), approach was used for the numerical investigation of the acoustic loadings. The numerical analysis was developed for various acoustic loading conditions and verified with the theoretical results, which showed that the numerical and theoretical models agree well. Both models were extended to a Boeing composite cylinder and an RSLVF for various acoustic loading conditions. The complex acoustic environment generated during the lift-off of a launch vehicle was investigated and used as a basis for the acoustic loading on an RSLVF. To predict the acoustic excitations on an RSLVF, two different source allocation techniques were investigated, which considered acoustic sources along the rocket engine exhaust flow. The investigations were conducted both numerically and analytically. Both results agree well and show that it is possible to predict the acoustic loads on the fairing numerically and analytically.

40|$|Recent patient {{evidence}} suggests that auditory forward predictions, relevant for processing self-initiated sounds, are generated in the cerebellum (CE). On the other hand, externally produced sounds, seem to be modulated by attentional processing driven by the basal ganglia (BG). As a self-initiated sound is fully predictable {{in terms of its}} timing and sensory consequence, the N 1 to this stimulus is suppressed when compared to the N 1 elicited by an externally produced sound. However, it is unknown how additional <b>external</b> <b>sounds</b> modulate the N 1 suppression effect. Including such sounds allow to investigate the robustness of the suppression effect, and to compare self-initiated <b>sounds</b> and multiple <b>external</b> <b>sounds</b> in the same condition. In the current study we tested patients with BG or CE lesions in a paradigm comparing self-initiated and externally produced sounds that were followed by unpredictable <b>external</b> <b>sounds.</b> We report that healthy controls show a clear N 1 suppression elicited by self-initiated sounds. Furthermore, all additional <b>external</b> <b>sounds</b> differed significantly from self-initiated sounds. Compared to controls, CE patients did not show a N 1 suppression effect, indicating that the CE is involved in generating auditory forward predictions. Also, CE patients did not show significant differences between additional <b>external</b> <b>sounds</b> and self-initiated sounds, indicating that self- and externally produced sounds are not distinguished. In contrast, BG patients did show a N 1 suppression to self-initiated sounds, but amplitudes to self- and externally produced sounds were globally reduced. As the N 1 amplitude is highly modulated by attention, this finding implies that the BG are involved in attentional processing of auditory stimuli...|$|R

Aims {{of this study were}} to identify early predictors for the future development of tinnitus severity. MethodPatients with tinnitus of no longer than 4 [*]weeks presenting at an otolaryngologist filled out questionnaires at inclusion (T 1), as well as 3 (T 3), and 6 [*]months (T 4) after tinnitus onset. 6 [*]weeks after onset, an interview was conducted over the phone (T 2). An audiogram was taken at T 1, perceived tinnitus loudness, and tinnitus-related distress were assessed separately and repeatedly together with oversensitivity to <b>external</b> <b>sounds</b> and the <b>levels</b> of depression and anxiety. Furthermore, coping strategies with illness were recorded. ResultsComplete remission until T 4 was observed in 11 % of the 47 participants, while voiced complaints at onset were stable in the majority. In the subgroup with a relevant level of depression at T 1, tinnitus-related distress worsened in 30 % until T 4. For unilateral tinnitus, perceived loudness in the chronic condition correlated strongly with hearing loss at 2 [*]kHz on the tinnitus ear, while a similar correlation was not found for tinnitus located to both ears or within the head. ConclusionResults suggest early manifestation of tinnitus complaints, and stress the importance of screening all patients presenting with acute tinnitus for levels of depression and tinnitus-related distress. Furthermore, hearing levels should be monitored, and use of hearing aids should be considered to reduce tinnitus loudness after having ascertained that sound sensitivity is within normal range...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the perception of soundscape reproduced by an ambisonic reproduction system on a horizontal plane, how the experience of space affected the perception of soundscape reproduction, and how the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> adjustment on soundscape reproduction affected the perception of soundscape compared with actual conditions. There were three experiments conducted: a soundwalk in situ in Manchester (United Kingdom) city centre, listening tests in Salford (United Kingdom), and listening tests in Bandung (Indonesia). The listening tests used material recorded from four locations on the soundwalk route in Manchester. The Salford listening tests were performed at the in-situ measured <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> and {{the participants were asked to}} adjust the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> to the level that represents actual locations. The listening test in Bandung was conducted to understand the effect of participants who never come to the actual location to the perception of soundscape and the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> adjustment. The listening tests in Bandung were conducted at the in situ <b>sound</b> <b>level,</b> at 9. 5 dB below the in situ <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> (based on the preference <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> from the experiment in Salford), and the participants were also requested to adjust the <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> to the level that represents the actual space (to examine the consistency with the experiment in Salford).

Analysis of the semantic differential results showed that the ambisonic reproduction produced a similar subjective experience to the in situ soundwalk when the reproduction <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> was 9. 5 dB lower than the actual <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> in situ.
