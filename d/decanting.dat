40|$|This work {{compare the}} {{efficiency}} of water treatment from Rimac river. Samples from different phases of water treatment (<b>decanted,</b> filtered and chlorinated) were compared with not treated samples. Coliphages quantification was made by Simple Layer and Membrane Filter methods. Most Probable Number (NMP) and Membrane Filter methods were used to assessment of Total Coliforms, Coliforms Thermotolerants and Heterotrophic Bacteria. The standard strain of E. coli C ATCC 13706 was used as coliphages host. The averages of quantified coliphages were of 2267, 25 UFP/ 100 mL in samples with out treatment; 2, 11, 2, 04 and 1, 07 UFP/ 100 mL in the water samples from <b>decanted,</b> filtered and chlorinated treatment respectively. Total Coliforms and Coliforms Thermotolerants were not detected in samples of chlorinated water. The correlation between coliphages and Total Coliforms in samples of <b>decanted</b> and filtered water (r = 0, 3793 and r = 0, 3629 respectively) were significant (p 0, 05). Correlations between coliphages and the Coliforms Thermotolerants were significant with water samples from treatment <b>decanted,</b> filtered and chlorinated (r = 0, 7129; 0, 5326 and 0, 4612, p 99, 99 % for the CT and CTT...|$|R
25|$|Partial {{pressure}} blending using pure oxygen decanted {{into the}} cylinder before topping up with air may involve very high oxygen fractions and oxygen partial pressures during the <b>decanting</b> process, which constitute {{a relatively high}} fire hazard. This procedure requires care and precautions by the operator, and <b>decanting</b> equipment and cylinders which are clean for oxygen service, but the equipment is relatively simple and inexpensive. Partial pressure blending using pure oxygen {{is often used to}} provide nitrox on live-aboard dive boats, but it is also used in some dive shops and clubs.|$|E

25|$|In gas blending, high {{temperatures}} are easily produced, by adiabatic heating, simply by <b>decanting</b> high-pressure gas into lower pressure pipes or cylinders. The pressure falls as the gas leaves the opened valve but then increases when the gas encounters obstructions {{such as a}} cylinder or a bend, constriction or particle in the pipe-work.|$|E
25|$|The wines of the Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine and Muscadet-Côtes de Grand Lieu {{appellation}} {{are often}} bottled sur lie {{straight from the}} tank that they are fermented in without any racking or filtering. This create wines {{that can be very}} cloudy and require <b>decanting</b> to remove sediments but also produces wines that can be fuller bodied and show extra dimensions of freshness.|$|E
25|$|One {{simple way}} to reduce the heat of <b>decanting</b> is to open valves slowly. With {{sensitive}} valves, such as needle valves, the gas can slowly be allowed through the valve so that the pressure increase is slow on the low-pressure side. The pipe-work, joints and valves in the blending system should be designed to minimize sharp bends and sudden constrictions. Sometimes 360-degree loops are present in the pipe-work to reduce vibration.|$|E

40|$|Sludge Batch 4 (SB 4) is {{currently}} being processed in the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) using Frit 510. The slurry pumps in Tank 40 are experiencing in-leakage of bearing water, which is causing the sludge slurry in Tank 40 to become dilute at a rapid rate. Currently, the DWPF is removing this dilution water by performing caustic boiling during the Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) cycle. In order to alleviate prolonged SRAT cycle times, which may eventually impact canister production rates, the Liquid Waste Organization (LWO) performed a 100 K gallon supernate <b>decant</b> of Tank 40 in April 2008. SRNL performed a supplemental glass variability study to support the April 2008 100 K gallon <b>decant</b> incorporating the impact of coupled operations (addition of the Actinide Removal Process (ARP) stream). Recently LWO requested that SRNL {{assess the impact of}} a second <b>decant</b> (up to 100 K gallon) to the Frit 510 -SB 4 system. This second <b>decant</b> occurred in June 2008. LWO provided nominal compositions on May 6, 2008 representing Tank 40 prior to the second <b>decant,</b> following the second <b>decant,</b> and the SB 4 Heel prior to blending with Tank 51 to constitute SB 5. Paper study assessments were performed for these options based on sludge-only and coupled operations processing (ARP addition), as well as possible Na{sub 2 }O additions (via NaOH additions) to both flowsheets. A review of the ComProTM database relative to the compositional region defined by the projections after the second <b>decant</b> coupled with Frit 510 identified only a few glasses with similar glass compositions. These glasses were acceptable from a durability perspective, but did not sufficiently cover the new glass compositional region. Therefore, SRNL recommended that a supplemental variability study be performed to support the June 2008 Tank 40 <b>decant.</b> Glasses were selected for the variability study based on three sludge compositional projections (sludge-only, coupled and coupled + 2 wt% Na{sub 2 }O) at waste loadings (WLs) of interest to DWPF (32 %, 35 % and 38 %). These nine glasses were fabricated and characterized using chemical composition analysis, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and the Product Consistency Test (PCT). All of the glasses that were selected for this study satisfy the Product Composition Control System (PCCS) criteria and are deemed processable and acceptable for the DWPF, except for the SB 4 VS 2 - 03 (sludge-only at 38 % WL) target composition. This glass fails the T{sub L} criterion and would not be considered processable based on Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) acceptability decisions. The durabilities of all of the study glasses (both quenched and ccc) are well below that of the normalized leachate for boron (NL [B]) of the reference EA glass (16. 695 g/L) and are predictable using the current PCCS models. Very little variation exists between the NL [B] of the quenched and ccc versions of the glasses. There is some evidence of a trend toward a less durable glass as WL increases for some of the sludge projections. Frit 510 is a viable option for the processing of SB 4 after a second Tank 40 <b>decant</b> with or without the addition of products from the ARP stream as well as the 2 wt% Na{sub 2 }O addition. The addition of ARP had no negative impacts on the acceptability and predictability of the variability study glasses...|$|R

25|$|Gas {{blending}} of trimix involves <b>decanting</b> oxygen and helium into the diving cylinder and then topping up the mix with air from a diving air compressor. To ensure an accurate mix, after each helium and oxygen transfer, the mix {{is allowed to}} cool, its pressure is measured and further gas is decanted until the correct pressure is achieved. This process often takes hours and is sometimes spread over days at busy blending stations.|$|E
25|$|The process {{involves}} air or oxygen {{being introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} screened, and primary treated sewage or industrial wastewater (wastewater) combined with organisms to develop a biological floc which reduces the organic content of the sewage.

Other important constituents include motile and sedentary Rotifers. In poorly managed activated sludge, a range of mucilaginous filamentous bacteria can develop including Sphaerotilus natans which produces a sludge that is difficult to settle and can result in the sludge blanket <b>decanting</b> over the weirs in the settlement tank to severely contaminate the final effluent quality. This material is often described as sewage fungus but true fungal communities are relatively uncommon.|$|E

25|$|As {{red wine}} ages, the harsh tannins of its youth {{gradually}} {{give way to}} a softer mouthfeel. An inky dark color will eventually lose its depth of color and begin to appear orange at the edges, and then later eventually turning brown. These changes occur due to the complex chemical reactions of the phenolic compounds of the wine. In processes that begin during fermentation and continue after bottling, these compounds bind together and aggregate. Eventually these particles reach a certain size where they are too large to stay suspended in the solution and precipitate out. The presence of visible sediment in a bottle will usually indicate a mature wine. The resulting wine, with this loss of tannins and pigment, will have a paler color and taste softer, less astringent. The sediment, while harmless, can have an unpleasant taste and is often separated from the wine by <b>decanting.</b>|$|E
