40|$|Ferritic {{stainless}} steels and other alloys are {{of great interest}} to SOFC developers for applications such as interconnects, cell frames, and balance of plant components. While these alloys offer significant advantages (e. g., low material and manufacturing cost, high thermal conductivity, and high temperature oxidation resistance), there are challenges which can hinder their utilization in SOFC systems; these challenges include Cr volatility and reactivity with <b>glass</b> <b>seals.</b> To overcome these challenges, protective coatings and surface treatments for the alloys are under development. In particular, aluminization of alloy surfaces offers the potential for mitigating both evaporation of Cr from the alloy surface and reaction of alloy constituents with <b>glass</b> <b>seals.</b> Commercial aluminization processes are available to SOFC developers, but they tend to be costly due to their use of exotic raw materials and/or processing conditions.

40|$|Vacuum {{packaging}} utilizing {{glass frit}} is investigated {{for the use}} with a micro-fuel processor. Enhanced device performance through proper thermal management motivates {{the need for a}} vacuum package on the micro scale. Constraints imposed by the design and fabrication of the micro-fuel processor deem glass frit bonding as the optimal method for packaging. The quality of the <b>glass</b> <b>seal</b> is dependent on the pre-sintering process as well as bonding parameters. Ideal pre-sintering of a lead-zinc-borosilicate glass tape, GPR- 10 from Vitta Corp., has been achieved, and a vacuum bonding technique was optimized. The seal quality is determined visually with microscopy by comparing the size and quantity of voids present in the frit layer post-bonding. A package with a vacuum of <I 50 mTorr was obtained but the seal quickly degraded. A new packaging scheme utilizing a two-step bond process is developed and evaluated.

40|$|A {{family of}} glass/ceramic {{composite}} materials {{has been investigated}} for use as sealants in planar solid oxide fuel cells. These materials are modified versions of a barium calcium aluminosilicate glass developed previously for the same purpose. The composition of the glass in mole percentages is 35 BaO + 15 CaO + 5 Al 2 O 3 + 10 B 2 O 3 + 35 SiO 2. The <b>glass</b> <b>seal</b> {{was found to be}} susceptible to cracking during thermal cycling of the fuel cells. The goal in formulating the glass/ ceramic composite materials was to (1) retain the physical and chemical advantages that led to the prior selection of the barium calcium aluminosilicate glass as the sealant while (2) increasing strength and fracture toughness so as to reduce the tendency toward cracking. Each of the composite formulations consists of the glass plus either of two ceramic reinforcements in a proportion between 0 and 30 mole percent. One of the ceramic reinforcements consists of alumina platelets; the other one consists of particles of yttria-stabilized zirconia wherein the yttria content is 3 mole percent (3 YSZ).

40|$|Abstract. The {{previously}} developed relaxation {{model for}} annealing of glass seals with other materials {{has been applied}} widely. It remains unclear whether there are a specific low temperature and very long-term iso-thermal treatments at which this simple model ceases to work correctly and requires complication or even revision. With the aim to determine the minimum fictive temperature at which the relaxation model of annealing of <b>glass</b> <b>seal</b> with an elastic material is still applicable, the stresses in the sandwich S 52 - 2 glass-molybdenum seals are measured at different stabilization temperatures. The experimental temperature-time dependences of the stresses are compared with those calculated using the relaxation model of seal annealing. The use of this relatively simple model leads to a quite satisfactory agreement (even if not identical at all the temperatures) {{in the range from}} the glass transition temperature to 380 ◦C for stabilization durations as long as 81 days. This treatment duration makes it possible to reach a structural temperature of 434 ◦C, which is considerably lower than the structural temperature (525 ◦C) obtained upon simple cooling of glass at a rate of 3 K/mm. 1...|$|E
