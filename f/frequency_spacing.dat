25|$|The IF stage {{includes}} a filter and/or multiple tuned circuits {{in order to}} achieve the desired selectivity. This filtering must therefore have a band pass equal to or less than the <b>frequency</b> <b>spacing</b> between adjacent broadcast channels. Ideally a filter would have a high attenuation to adjacent channels, but maintain a flat response across the desired signal spectrum in order to retain the quality of the received signal. This may be obtained using one or more dual tuned IF transformers, a quartz crystal filter, or a multipole ceramic crystal filter.|$|E
25|$|If the ordered pairs {{representing}} the original input function are equally spaced in their input variable (for example, equal time steps), then the Fourier transform {{is known as}} a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which can be computed either by explicit numerical integration, by explicit evaluation of the DFT definition, or by fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods. In contrast to explicit integration of input data, use of the DFT and FFT methods produces Fourier transforms described by ordered pairs of step size equal to the reciprocal of the original sampling interval. For example, if the input data is sampled for 10 seconds, the output of DFT and FFT methods will have a 0.1Hz <b>frequency</b> <b>spacing.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{modulation}} {{transfer function}} {{of an image}} intensifier {{is a measure of}} the output amplitude of dark and light lines on the display for a given level of input from lines presented to the photocathode at different resolutions. It is usually given as a percentage at a given <b>frequency</b> (<b>spacing)</b> of light and dark lines. For example, if you look at white and black lines with a MTF of 99% @ 2 lp/mm then the output of the dark and light lines is going to be 99% as dark or light as looking at a black image or a white image. This value decreases for a given increase in resolution also. On the same tube if the MTF at 16 and 32 lp/mm was 50% and 3% then at 16 lp/mm the signal would be only half as bright/dark as the lines were for 2 lp/mm and at 32 lp/mm the image of the lines would be only three percent as bright/dark as the lines were at 2 lp/mm.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a new adaptive content-based localized watermarking algorithm for remote sensing images based on DWT, which adaptively embeds corresponding watermarks into the local regions of the remote sensing image instead of the entire one. In order to improve watermarking capability against attacks in the frequency area, we selected some stable feature points in the remote sensing image, then used them to identify the locations where we inserted the local watermarks, namely we embedded the watermarks into the local sub-images centered by those feature points. When the remote sensing image is cropped, we can also detect and orient watermarks by the feature points in the remaining one. Moreover the algorithm took the new watermarking-embedding strategy based on DWT domain to embed the local watermarks, namely watermarks should be embedded into the low <b>frequency</b> <b>space</b> firstly, and the remains are embedded into the high <b>frequency</b> <b>spaces</b> according to their significance. And different embedding strength for watermarks should {{be applied to the}} low <b>frequency</b> <b>space</b> and the high ones respectively. In order to further improve robustness of watermarks, the embedded local watermark is designed to be orthogonal to the feature vector of the low <b>frequency</b> <b>space</b> (LL 3) in DWT area of the corresponding sub-image, which means that watermarking casting is remote sensing image content dependent. In addition, the algorithm exploited the Neymann-Pearson criterion to detect watermarks. Experimental results show that the watermarking algorithm is robust to all kinds of attacks, especially cropping. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} a grating in real and <b>frequency</b> <b>space</b> is {{examined}} {{in the context of}} a three-pulse optical excitation cycle applied to a pseudo two-level model system. The calculations are done analytically using the Liouville-operator formalism in matrix form. It is shown that a continuous transition occurs from a grating in real space to a grating in <b>frequency</b> <b>space</b> when the first two excitation pulses separate in time. During this transition, the role of the population-relaxation time constant (T 1) is taken over by the dephasing time constant (T 2) bringing out the irreversible nature of the loss of coherence in an excited state. The underlying space-time transformation when moving from a grating in real space to a grating in <b>frequency</b> <b>space</b> further clarifies the loss in symmetry of the scattering pattern induced by a probe pulse by attributing it to the law of causality. It is finally concluded that the generalized grating concept is a powerful means of analyzing or predicting the effects of multiple-pulse multicolor optical-coherence experiments. ...|$|R
