Results {{demonstrate that the}} main factor determining {{the quality of the}} <b>electrolytic</b> <b>deposit</b> is the homogeneous formation of the first nuclei layer.

The electrolytic-formed alloy presents the highest microhardness values (900 HV 80 g) in comparison with that measured on the aluminum surface alloy obtained by laser techniques (520 HV 80 g) and 550 HV 80 g).

30|$|The {{functional}} {{properties of the}} coatings are structurally dependent, so both their composition and surface morphology will determine the performance characteristics of materials. The roughness and surface friction are the main characteristics of the surface quality of the coatings. Previously, it was shown [10] that binary and ternary coatings obtained in a pulse mode are characterized by higher microhardness and wear resistance due to their smooth surface. The roughness of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>deposits</b> can be significantly decreased using pulse mode [11]. Since {{the structure of the}} electrolytic alloys determines both the properties and application of coatings, study of their morphology and topography remains relevant.|$|R

Transparent electrically conductive layer of SnO 2 was deposited by pyrolytic decomposition of peroxostannate solution.

40|$|Hydroxyapatite (HA) coating was proved having {{bioactive}} {{property and}} hence improving the bonding strength on bone tissue without inducing {{the growth of}} fiber tissue. However, the weak adhesion between HA and metal implants is still the major problem. In this study, a novel method of electrolytic HA/ZrO 2 double layers coating was successfully conducted on F- 136 Ti- 6 Al- 4 V implant alloy in ZrO 2 (NO 3) (2) aqueous solution and subsequently in the mixed solution of Ca(NO 3) (2) and NE 4 H 2 PO 4. After annealing at 400 degrees C, 500 degrees C and 600 degrees C for 4 h in air, the coated specimens were evaluated by X-ray diffraction analyses, surface morphology observations, scratch tests, dynamic polarization tests, immersion tests and cell culture assays. In addition to corrosion resistance, the adhesion strength of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>deposited</b> HA on Ti alloy was dramatically improved from the critical scratch load 2 N to 32 N by adding the intermediate electrolytic deposition of ZrO 2, which showed the strong bonding effects between Ti alloy substrate and HA coating. Based on the cell morphology and cell proliferation data, HA/ZrO 2 double layers coating revealed the better substrate for the adhesion and proliferation of osteoblasts than the others. It was {{also found that the}} crystallization of HA had positive effect on the proliferation of osteoblasts. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Aluminum {{wire bonding}} to nickel {{surfaces}} {{is often used}} in automotive applications. For assurance of a high quality contact a clean substrate without any contaminants is required. In this study lead frame structures consisting of matte nickel, bright nickel and <b>electrolytic</b> <b>deposited</b> NiP (up to 0. 5 m thickness) were used for Aluminum wire bonding. The lead frame was partially plated with tin at the connector end (opposite from the wire bonding surface). During the tin plating process an unintentional tin layer of about 10 - 20 nm was deposited onto the NiP wire bonding surface. Laser ablation was used to clean the NiP areas before wire bonding. This paper presents microstructural investigations of the NiP/Sn platings with and without laser ablation. Using FIB/SEM/TEM the thickness and crystalline structure of NiP layer was analyzed. The phosphorous concentration gradient across {{the depth of the}} NiP layer was investigated by nano-spot EDX. Using nanoindentation measurements, the microhardeness of the laser etched and non-laser etched areas was determined and correlated to the microstructural phenomena. The investigations show that not only does the laser treatment remove the tin contamination but it also removes the P-rich surface film. The lasered samples also showed a very coarse grain structure close to the Ni film which indicates a temperature-induced recrystallization effect. These results correlate with the mechanical investigations: At a depth of 50 nm to 200 nm significant lower indentation hardness was measured in the lasered specimen compared to the non-lasered specimen as detected by CSM nanoindentation measurements as well as standard nanoindentation measurements...|$|R

40|$|<b>Electrolytic</b> copper <b>deposited</b> on (100) (Cu) single {{crystals}} forms pyramidal crystals {{that grow}} {{parallel to the}} substrate at low current density without stirring. With stirring and higher current density, slanting platelet crystals with (111) (Cu) orientation are formed. Chloride and gelatin are typical additives for electrolytic copper foils and the electrolytic copper foils are formed on a titanium substrate with a stirring rate and high current density. With gelatin, triangular pyramidal crystals form with (111) (Cu) orientation. The triangle-shaped side planes of the crystals are the (100) (Cu), and platelet crystals exist along the (100) (Cu). With chloride and gelatin, triangular columnar crystals with the (110) (Cu) orientation are formed. The triangle-shaped side planes of the crystals are the (100) (Cu) and the platelet crystals again exist along the (100) (Cu). These platelet crystals are bound by macrosteps, {{and they are the}} growth sites.

40|$|The zero-field {{microwave}} absorption, {{or natural}} ferromagnetic resonance, spectra in arrays of electrodeposited magnetic nanowires is studied {{as a function}} of the saturation magnetization of NiCu, NiFe, CoNiFe, and CoFe alloys of several compositions. Measurements show that due to the shape anisotropy, these systems present strong absorption peaks in the absence of an applied magnetic field in the GHz range due to the ferromagnetic resonance. Furthermore, the zero-field resonance frequency is observed to be independent of the wire diameter and density as well as the magnetic history and its value depends only on the material, through the saturation magnetization and the gyromagnetic factor. It is shown that, using different <b>electrolytic</b> solutions and <b>depositing</b> at different electrostatic potentials, the alloy composition can be varied and the remanent state resonance frequency can be tailored quasicontinuously between 4 and 31 GHz.

Designed to resist corrosion for 5,000 years, the alloy {{was made of}} 99.4% copper, 0.5% chromium, and 0.1% silver. Westinghouse claims that Cupaloy has the same strength as steel, yet will resist most corrosion over thousands of years because it becomes an anode in <b>electrolytic</b> reactions, receiving <b>deposits</b> instead of wasting away like most iron-bearing metals.

After van 't Hoff's theory was published, experimenters had trouble to replicate Pfeffer's measurements, mainly because they could not find or make clay cells of suitable quality to support the semipermeable membrane, a problem that had affected Pfeffer as well. Furthermore, Morse showed that Pfeffer's cells were leaky at high pressure. Morse's main experimental contribution was an <b>electrolytic</b> method of <b>depositing</b> semi-permeable membranes.

HA/ZrO 2 composite coated specimens were characterized by using SEM/EDS、XRD、polarization test、ultrasonic vibrating test and cell culture. The cyclic polarization tests in Hank's solution indicated that the patterned ZrO 2 coated and the patterned HA/ZrO 2 composite coated exhibited more resistant in corrosion than the substrate. The ultrasonic vibrating tests and SEM/EDS observations revealed that the patterned ZrO 2 /HA composite coated was more adhesive than the single HA coated. SEM observations of the cell culture showed the better extension of osteosarcoma on HA coated and the patterned ZrO 2 /HA composite coated than that on ZrO 2 coated and Ti alloy. 本研究是以生醫用TI- 6 Al- 4 V合金為基材，並且添加式樣化遮蔽物於基材上，在硝酸氧化鋯溶液中，利用電解沉積的方式，於表面沉積出具有式樣化的氫氧化鋯於基材表面上 。 之後在Ca/P比為 1. 67 的Ca(NO 3) 2 ‧ 4 H 2 O及NH 4 H 2 PO 4 的混合溶液中，沉積出氫氧基磷灰石陶瓷於式樣化氫氧化鋯鍍層上，再經低溫熱處理使其與基材形成更穩定之鍵結 。 選擇最佳的鍍膜條件後，由恆定電位儀 、 SEM/EDS 、 XRD 、 超音波震盪測試來探討各鍍層之性質，並且以細胞培養測試來觀察細胞在鍍層上之附著情形 。 經由循環極化的試驗結果，具有式樣化ZrO 2 鍍層與ZrO 2 /HA複合鍍層陶瓷鍍層，其鈍態電流密度降低、保護電位提高，均比基材好，顯示抗蝕性都比基材好 。 由超音波震盪測試並且配合SEM/EDS觀察，可發現具有式樣化ZrO 2 /HA複合鍍層比單層HA鍍層之附著力還好 。 經細胞培養測試，以骨瘤細胞體外培養方式來探討不同鍍層與鈦合金對細胞的生物反應情形 。 結果得知在附著型態及生長狀況，HA能引導骨細胞展開與貼附 。第一章 緒論………………………………………………. 1 1 - 1 研究背景……………………………………………… 1 1 - 2 研究目的…………………………………………… [...] 4 第二章 文獻回顧…………………………………………. 5 2 - 1 人工髖關節………………………………………… [...] 5 2 - 1 - 1 人工髖關節與材料的關係…………………… [...] 6 2 - 1 - 2 人工髖關節所面臨的問題…………………… [...] 7 2 - 1 - 3 人工骨柄固定………………………………… [...] 8 2 - 2 生醫材料之簡介……………………………………. 10 2 - 2 - 1 生醫材料之基本性質………………………… [...] . 11 2 - 2 - 2 生醫骨科植入材……………………………… [...] . 12 2 - 3 鈦及鈦合金…………………………………………. 15 2 - 3 - 1 鈦及鈦合金之性質…………………………… [...] . 15 2 - 3 - 2 鈦及鈦合金之腐蝕與氧化…………………… [...] . 16 2 - 4 氧化鋯陶瓷…………………………………………. 17 2 - 5 氫氧基磷灰石(HA) …………………………………. 18 2 - 5 - 1 HA之基本性質………………………………… [...] . 18 2 - 5 - 2 氫氧基磷灰石之結構………………………… [...] . 19 2 - 5 - 3 氫氧基磷灰石之合成………………………… [...] . 21 2 - 6 極化(Polarization) ………………………………. 22 2 - 6 - 1 活性極化(Activation polarization) …… [...] 22 2 - 6 - 2 濃度極化(Concentration polarization) … [...] . 23 2 - 6 - 3 電阻極化(Resistance polarization) …… [...] 24 2 - 7 生物陶瓷被覆………………………………………. 25 2 - 7 - 1 氧化鋯陶瓷薄膜披覆………………………… [...] . 25 2 - 7 - 2 HA陶瓷薄膜披覆……………………………… [...] . 26 2 - 8 電解沉積……………………………………………. 28 2 - 8 - 1 電解沉積氧化鋯反應機構…………………… [...] . 28 2 - 8 - 2 電解沉積HA反應機構………………………… [...] . 29 第三章 實驗步驟與方法……………………………… [...] 30 3 - 1 基材的準備與前處理……………………………… [...] 32 3 - 2 mask之準備與處理…………………………………. 34 3 - 3 電解液配製…………………………………………. 35 3 - 3 - 1 硝酸氧鋯電解液之配製……………………… [...] . 35 3 - 3 - 2 氫氧基磷灰石電解液之配製………………… [...] . 35 3 - 4 陰極極化……………………………………………. 35 3 - 5 電解沉積……………………………………………. 37 3 - 5 - 1 式樣化氧化鋯之沉積電位…………………… [...] . 37 3 - 5 - 2 式樣化氧化鋯之沉積時間…………………… [...] . 37 3 - 5 - 3 氫氧基磷灰石之沉積電位…………………… [...] . 37 3 - 5 - 4 氫氧基磷灰石之沉積時間…………………… [...] . 37 3 - 6 乾燥與熱處理………………………………………. 38 3 - 7 X光繞射分析……………………………………… [...] 38 3 - 8 電化學動態極化實驗………………………………. 39 3 - 9 SEM/EDS 沉積鍍層微結構與分析…………………. 41 3 - 10 橫切面側視分析…………………………………… 41 3 - 11 細胞培養試驗…………………………………… [...] 41 3 - 12 骨瘤細胞在材質上的型態變化及附著力的觀察 [...] 43 第四章 結果與討論…………………………………… [...] 44 4 - 1 陰極極化實驗………………………………………. 44 4 - 1 - 1 硝酸氧鋯溶液之陰極極化…………………… [...] . 44 4 - 1 - 2 硝酸氧鋯溶液加入mask之陰極極化……… [...] . 46 4 - 1 - 3 磷酸鈣溶液於Zr(OH) 4 /基材上之陰極極化… [...] . 47 4 - 2 電解沉積製程參數探討……………………………. 49 4 - 2 - 1 沉積電位之效應……………………………… [...] . 49 4 - 2 - 2 定電位下之穩定電流密度…………………… [...] . 51 4 - 2 - 3 沉積濃度之效應……………………………… [...] . 52 4 - 2 - 4 沉積時間之效應……………………………… [...] . 53 4 - 2 - 5 式樣化複合鍍層……………………………… [...] . 54 4 - 3 陰乾、未陰乾與熱處理對薄膜之影響……. ……… 55 4 - 4 X光繞射分析……………………………………… [...] 56 4 - 5 鍍層微結構分析……………………………………. 58 4 - 6 EDS成份分析……………………………………… [...] 60 4 - 7 動態極化測試………………………………………. 61 4 - 8 橫切面側視分析……………………………………. 65 4 - 9 超音波震盪實驗……………………………………. 66 4 - 10 細胞附著力及形態之觀察……………………… [...] 67 第五章 結論……………………………………………… 69 參考文獻…………………………………………………. 7...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with an experimental and a theoretical study {{of the effects of}} bulk diffusion on the electrolytic nucleation and growth of silver deposits on tin oxide-coated glass and on glassy carbon. The existing nucleation and growth theory is extended to cover cases where the electrode concentration is a function of time. The manner in which the electrode concentration varies with time depends on the transport of metal ions through the bulk of the solution. The time dependent concentration functions are coupled with solutions of the differential equations that describe transport in solution.;Finite difference calculations are done on single isolated growth sites, as well as on growth sites arranged in square grids. These square grids of sites are used to show that when the site density is greater than 10 (2 ̆ 78) sites cm(2 ̆ 7 - 2) uniform concentration across the face of the electrode can be assumed. Once the assumption of uniform concentration is made, it is possible to calculate current-time transients without resorting to finite differences. The non-linear integral equation is used to numerically solve for the electric current and the electrode concentration of metal ions as functions of time. This technique is shown to be very versatile and is used to calculate current transients where such factors as site overlap and electrode resistance are important. In the simplest case where metal deposition (no back-reaction) without site overlap or significant electrode resistance is occurring, an exact solution for the current-time transient and the metal ion concentration at the electrode is found.;The integral equation solutions for the current transients are then fitted, via a non-linear least-squares technique, to current transients obtained from the poteniostatic deposition of silver on tin oxide-coated glass electrodes. The parameters of these least-squares fits are then used to calculate the electrode symmetry factor for silver reduction and the diffusion coefficient for silver ion in 1 mol L(2 ̆ 7 - 1) KNO(, 3). Both values compare well with literature values. This is the first quantitative model for the effect of bulk diffusion on the nucleation and growth kinetics of <b>electrolytic</b> silver <b>deposits</b> on semiconductors...|$|R
