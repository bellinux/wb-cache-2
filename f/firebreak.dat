5|$|A {{contemporary}} account {{said that}} King Charles in person worked manually, that day or later, to help throw water on flames {{and to help}} demolish buildings to make a <b>firebreak.</b>|$|E
5|$|Working {{to a plan}} at last, James's firefighters {{had also}} created a large <b>firebreak</b> {{to the north of}} the conflagration. It {{contained}} the fire until late afternoon, when the flames leapt across and began to destroy the wide, affluent luxury shopping street of Cheapside.|$|E
5|$|Everybody {{had thought}} St. Paul's Cathedral a safe refuge, with its thick stone walls and natural <b>firebreak</b> {{in the form}} of a wide, empty {{surrounding}} plaza. It had been crammed full of rescued goods and its crypt filled with the tightly packed stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining Paternoster Row. However, an enormous stroke of bad luck meant that the building was covered in wooden scaffolding, undergoing piecemeal restoration by a relatively unknown Christopher Wren. The scaffolding caught fire on Tuesday night.|$|E
50|$|Forested areas often contain vast {{networks}} of <b>firebreaks.</b> Some communities are also using <b>firebreaks</b> {{as part of}} their city planning strategy.|$|R
5|$|As the map shows, the Hiroshima {{firestorm}} jumped natural <b>firebreaks</b> (river channels), {{as well as}} prepared <b>firebreaks.</b> The {{spread of}} fire stopped only when it reached {{the edge of the}} blast-damaged area, encountering less available fuel.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} food {{items of the}} Blue-and-yellow Macaw (Ara ararauna) flocks foraging at <b>firebreaks</b> in western Cerrado, Brazil. Also, I discuss ecological aspects of macaw feeding activities at <b>firebreaks.</b> Two 3, 500 ha portions of Emas National Park were selected for observations. The sites were mosaics of woodland savanna and shrubby grassland, crossed and bordered by <b>firebreaks</b> and adjacent unsealed roads. A total of 76 foraging flocks of macaws were recorded at <b>firebreaks</b> between September 2006 and February 2007. Seven plant species were identified as food items. Seeds of a shrub species (Anacardium humile) were the most often consumed resource. Parts of other plant species were sometimes consumed. Macaws perched in tree canopies to consume their young apical parts, young leaves, flowers and parts of branches. The frequency of consumption of parts of shrubs {{was significantly higher than}} that of trees. At Emas National Park, numerous Blue-and-yellow Macaw flocks are attracted to <b>firebreaks</b> mainly by fruiting A. humile patches. Their foraging activities often damage reproductive and young parts of shrubs and trees...|$|R
5|$|London Bridge was {{the only}} {{physical}} connection between the City and {{the south side of}} the river Thames and was itself covered with houses. It had been noted as a deathtrap in the fire of 1632 and, by dawn on Sunday, these houses were burning. Samuel Pepys observed the conflagration from the Tower of London and recorded great concern for friends living on the bridge. There were fears that the flames would cross London Bridge to threaten the borough of Southwark on the south bank, but this danger was averted by an open space between buildings on the bridge which acted as a <b>firebreak.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{fire was}} principally {{expanding}} {{north and west}} by dawn on Monday, 3 September, the turbulence of the fire storm pushing the flames both farther south and farther north than the day before. The spread to the south was mostly halted by the river, but it had torched the houses on London Bridge and was threatening to cross the bridge and endanger the borough of Southwark on the south bank of the river. Southwark was preserved by a pre-existent <b>firebreak</b> on the bridge, a long gap between the buildings which had saved {{the south side of}} the Thames in the fire of 1632 and now did so again. Flying embers started a fire in Southwark but it was quickly stopped.|$|E
25|$|The battery stands {{slightly}} {{north of}} the wind turbine within Panorama Heights subdivision, on a site allocated as reserve land. The site backs on to the <b>firebreak</b> running around the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary.|$|E

40|$|Fire {{management}} {{is a common}} practice in several reserves in the Cerrado, but its influences on bird reproduction remain unknown. In addition, the nesting biology of the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) has been studied in numerous environments, but not in tropical grasslands managed by fire. This study {{examined the effects of}} fire management on the nesting biology of A. cunicularia in Emas National Park, State of Goias, central Brazilian Cerrado. We compared the number of breeding pairs and their burrows in October and November 2009 at 15 study sites in grasslands managed by fire (<b>firebreaks)</b> and unmanaged grasslands adjacent to and distant from <b>firebreaks.</b> We visited active burrows two-four times and described the burrow entrances and sentinel sites and counted and observed adults and young. A total of 19 burrows were found at <b>firebreaks.</b> One and two burrows were found in grasslands adjacent to and distant from <b>firebreaks,</b> respectively. For all burrows found, one to three young reached the adult size, being able to fly and/or run in early November. The 22 burrows found were in the ground, associated or not with termite and ant nests. Most (86. 4 %) burrows had only one entrance. Only three burrows had two or three entrances. Structures used as sentinel perches by adults were mounds in front of the burrow entrances, termite nests, shrubs and trees. Most of these sentinel sites were shorter than 2 m high and located less than 10 m from the burrow entrance. At Emas National Park, <b>firebreaks</b> appear to provide more attractive conditions to the nesting of A. cunicularia than unmanaged grasslands, likely because of the short herbaceous stratum due to frequent burning of <b>firebreaks.</b> This study suggests that fire management provides suitable conditions for the successful reproduction of A. cunicularia in <b>firebreaks</b> at Emas National Park...|$|R
50|$|Despite a joint {{federal and}} state {{government}} plan to save it, since the 1980s, the Leadbeater's possum population halved to around 2000 even before the Black Saturday fires. Many more were killed early in 2007 when the government-backed enterprise company, VicForests, bulldozed large <b>firebreaks</b> through Leadbeater's monitoring stations following the Christmas fires - <b>firebreaks</b> and clear-felling also prevent breeding with nearby colonies.|$|R
25|$|Within this Conservation Area, 37 orchid species exist. The area {{is known}} for its orchid diversity, with one of the highest densities of orchid species {{anywhere}} in Tasmania. Of the vast number of orchid species inhabiting the Peter Murrell Conservation Area, five endemic orchid species exist, including the trim leek-orchid (Prasophyllum concinnum) and the dark-finger-orchid (Caladenia atrata). In recent years it appears that the orchid diversity and abundance has been declining. A potential explanation for these declines are infrequent burning events, absence of rain following prescribed burns, and <b>firebreak</b> slashing during key flowering periods, October to early December.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} on London Bridge were a major fire hazard {{and increased the}} load on its arches, several of {{which had to be}} rebuilt over the centuries. In 1212, perhaps the greatest of the early fires of London broke out on both ends of the bridge simultaneously, trapping many people in the middle. Houses on the bridge were burnt during Wat Tyler's Peasants' Revolt in 1381 and during Jack Cade's rebellion in 1450. A major fire of 1633 that destroyed the northern third of the bridge formed a <b>firebreak</b> that prevented further damage to the bridge during the Great Fire of London (1666).|$|E
25|$|After noon, {{a renewal}} of the {{conflagration}} on the Gateshead side arose as a stream of blazing sulphur made its way east along the riverbank, setting light to Mr. Davidson's flour mill, which had hitherto merely been ruined by the explosion. It was quickly alight, and for several hours afterwards the fire travelled east from building to building. This mass of buildings was still alight at midnight, {{at which point the}} flames were licking at St. Mary's church; but this was saved by heroic effort. In the emergency, it was resolved to demolish by explosion some of the already shattered houses to the east of the fire to form a <b>firebreak,</b> a task quickly accomplished by parties of sappers and miners. By this means, and by the action of the powerful floating engines, the fire was confined and at length consumed and extinguished.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Firebreaks,</b> {{along with}} backburning, {{are also the}} source of the {{everyday}} phrase [...] "fight fire with fire".|$|R
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 11July, <b>firebreaks</b> had been {{established}} around the area, but the fire continued to rage inside.|$|R
50|$|RAFTs are {{skilled in}} dry {{firefighting}} {{techniques such as}} creating <b>firebreaks</b> by cutting mineral earth trails or undertaking backburning work.|$|R
25|$|When the {{bombardment}} resumed, {{the city was}} hammered even harder across an even larger area: on the north, towards the Mint and the Dominican convent, where large quantities of furniture, heirlooms, works of art and family archives had been stored and would soon be lost underneath the rubble. To the east, fear spread that the St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral would be destroyed, and its riches were evacuated. The area around {{what is now the}} Brussels-Central railway station and the Chapel of Mary Magdalene of Brussels were ablaze, and the Récollet convent, already hit the night before, was near completely destroyed. Destruction then came to the Saint John Hospital, and in the night, to the Church of the Chapel. By the morning of August 15, the entire city centre was an enormous brazier. To save the surrounding city by stopping the spread of the fire, Max Emmanuel used gunpowder to demolish numerous buildings to form a giant <b>firebreak</b> around the affected area, despite strong opposition by the buildings' owners.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the night the wind settled and stopped the forward march of the fire. Thirty-six homes were {{selected}} for demolition to create a <b>firebreak,</b> which did stop the fire at the corner of Store Regnegade and Gothersgade. Further west, Amagertorv and the church Sankt Nicolai Kirke had been threatened, but the blaze was stopped close to Amagertorv, where only the three houses furthest north ("Frimands Kvarter" [...] lots 8, 10 and 11) were lost.|$|E
500|$|Tuesday, 4 September {{was the day}} of {{greatest}} destruction. The Duke of York's command post at Temple Bar, where Strand meets Fleet Street, was supposed to stop the fire's westward advance towards the Palace of Whitehall. He hoped that the River Fleet would form a natural <b>firebreak,</b> making a stand with his firemen from the Fleet Bridge {{and down to the}} Thames. However, early on Tuesday morning, the flames jumped over the Fleet and outflanked them, driven by the unabated easterly gale, forcing them to run for it. There was consternation at the palace as the fire continued implacably westward; [...] "Oh, the confusion there was then at that court!" [...] wrote Evelyn.|$|E
40|$|In an area {{of coastal}} lowland managed by the Forestry Department of Queensland, {{habitats}} differed in the density, height and species composition of their undergrowth. In natural habitats Themeda australis made {{up the bulk of}} the diet of M. giganteus, but in <b>firebreaks</b> a range of grasses were eaten. Kangaroos actively fed only in habitats with open undergrowth, and in these habitats the density of faecal pellets correlated with the abundance of food present. Dense undergrowth restricted use of habitat even for movement. The abundance of food and the height and density of the undergrowth in contiguous habitat influenced the abundance of sightings on <b>firebreaks.</b> <b>Firebreaks</b> create a new source of abundant food. Prescribed burning attracts kangaroos to habitats by opening up dense undergrowth and encouraging the growth of grass...|$|R
25|$|There {{are small}} roads around some areas, remains of old farm roads {{from before the}} land was expropriated, which serve as <b>firebreaks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Diamond is an {{excellent}} thermal conductor, but some forms of graphite are used for thermal insulation (for example heat shields and <b>firebreaks).</b>|$|R
500|$|A simple sod {{house could}} be built in about a week, and for a cost of less than five dollars. [...] Cost {{was not the only}} advantage. [...] The thick walls {{provided}} insulation against summer heat and winter cold; the latter was particularly important in light of the dearth of firewood on the plains, which forced the early settlers to burn corncobs, twisted grass, or dried buffalo dung. [...] The walls also withstood prairie winds better than framed walls; even sod houses struck by tornadoes generally survived with no worse damage than the loss of the roof, leaving the walls standing. [...] Sod houses also provided a safe refuge against prairie fires, especially when surrounded by a plowed and back-burned <b>firebreak.</b>|$|E
500|$|After Pinball Alley, racers briefly mush {{along the}} Yukon River before {{climbing}} the riverbank to the Carmacks checkpoint. They then follow a road for about [...] and turn onto a <b>firebreak</b> trail. After departing the trail, they travel alongside {{and across the}} Yukon River to McCabe Creek, the first dog drop on the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route. Leaving McCabe Creek, the race trail parallels a driveway and the Klondike Highway for several miles before turning north to cross the Pelly Burn, an area scorched by a wildfire in 1995. Because the fire destroyed much of the forest in the area, {{this portion of the}} trail has few obstacles and is considered fast. From the McCabe Creek site it is about [...] to Pelly Crossing.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} conference {{on the night of}} August 13–14 at which the {{surrender}} finally was decided, a group of senior army officers including Anami gathered in a nearby room. All those present were concerned {{about the possibility of a}} coup d'état to prevent the surrender—some of those present may have even been considering launching one. After a silence, General Torashirō Kawabe proposed that all senior officers present sign an agreement to carry out the Emperor's order of surrender—"The Army will act in accordance with the Imperial Decision to the last." [...] It was signed by all the high-ranking officers present, including Anami, Hajime Sugiyama, Yoshijirō Umezu, Kenji Doihara, Torashirō Kawabe, Masakazu Kawabe, and Tadaichi Wakamatsu. [...] "This written accord by the most senior officers in the Army... acted as a formidable <b>firebreak</b> against any attempt to incite a coup d'état in Tokyo." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1951 {{the first}} preparatory work on its {{construction}} began: cutting <b>firebreaks,</b> {{the construction of}} access roads, including roads branch from Paveletskaya.|$|R
50|$|Given the {{inferior}} equipment {{available at the}} time and the difficulties in transporting water, it was probably not possible the extinguish the fire itself. As the fire crossed the major street (Hornsgatan) in the area, firefighting efforts turned towards the construction of <b>firebreaks</b> well in advance of the fire's spread. Using some open areas on either side of Hornsgatan, the <b>firebreaks</b> were able to halt the fire's advance, and it burned itself out early on the morning of July 20 (Friday).|$|R
50|$|While a 24-man {{firefighting}} crew desperately dug <b>firebreaks</b> {{the wind}} shifted, {{and the fire}} jumped the line. The men buried themselves in the earth of a recent landslide, and survived the fire.|$|R
2500|$|The Georgia Division of Forestry was notified, {{and workers}} arrived with bulldozers and plowed a <b>firebreak</b> {{to contain the}} forest fire.|$|E
