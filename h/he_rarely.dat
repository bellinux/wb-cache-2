5|$|Regarded as a courteous {{and educated}} man, Koniecpolski participated {{in all the}} Sejm {{sessions}} that he could, though <b>he</b> <b>rarely</b> spoke publicly due to his stutter. He was widely respected and highly popular among his szlachta peers.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker won {{the local}} people over through his success; {{in his first year}} in practice, he tried 62 jury trials, winning {{approximately}} half of his cases. <b>He</b> <b>rarely</b> called defence witnesses, thereby avoiding the possibility of rebuttal witnesses for the Crown, and securing the last word for himself. In late 1920, {{he was elected to the}} village council to serve a three-year term.|$|E
5|$|Pierre Gustave Toutant-Beauregard (May 28, 1818 – February 20, 1893) was an American {{military}} {{officer who was}} the first prominent general of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Today, he is commonly referred to as P. G. T. Beauregard, but <b>he</b> <b>rarely</b> used his first name as an adult. He signed correspondence as G. T. Beauregard.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to influencing fashion through his position, Osborn {{is known for}} his personal style. He wears a flamboyant mustache and often matches it with a wide brimmed hat. <b>He's</b> <b>rarely</b> seen without a fresh boutonniere. Osborn has been featured in magazines such as GQ, Vogue Hommes and Esquire.|$|R
50|$|Like in the Sleepwalker, <b>he</b> is <b>rarely,</b> if {{not ever}} {{mentioned}} in the book.|$|R
50|$|Kam Tai-mui's son {{who works}} mostly in Mainland China so <b>he</b> is <b>rarely</b> home.|$|R
5|$|The Smeezingtons use an Akai MPC4000, Roland Fantom S88, V‑Synth GT, {{a regular}} V‑Synth, Korg R3, MicroKorg, Novation Ultranova, Dave Smith Mopho, and two Access Virus TI's to produce music. Ari Levine stated that <b>he</b> <b>rarely</b> uses MPC, Storm Drum or Addictive Drums as software. In August 2012, the team {{purchased}} a Korg keyboard.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, <b>he</b> <b>rarely</b> made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
5|$|Although Swift {{knew that}} the Duchess of Kendal was {{responsible}} for selling the patent to Wood, <b>he</b> <b>rarely</b> mentions this fact in the Letters. Instead, his first three letters describe Wood as the mastermind behind the patent. Although the Drapier constantly asserts his loyalty to the King, his words did not prevent accusations of treason from being levelled against him {{in response to the}} third and fourth letters.|$|E
5000|$|Pak Budi (Tarra Budiman) is {{the main}} {{character}} of the show. He teaches his students how to speak Indonesian. He is very patient, even throughout all the squabbles and problems in his class. He has asthma and must carry an inhaler. Nowadays, <b>he's</b> <b>rarely</b> {{to be seen in}} the class, therefore Bu Rika replace him (or another teacher that she appointed) ...|$|R
50|$|Cuthbert Cringeworthy has a King Charles Spaniel called Cringley, but <b>he</b> very <b>rarely</b> {{features}} in the strip.|$|R
50|$|On 18 June 2015 Crispim was loaned {{to fellow}} top {{division}} club Joinville, {{until the end}} of the year. Returning to Santos in January 2016, <b>he</b> appeared <b>rarely</b> before serving another loan stint at second tier side Atlético Goianiense; <b>he</b> also appeared <b>rarely</b> with the club, which achieved promotion as champions.|$|R
5|$|Although {{he made no}} pretence {{regarding}} {{the significance of the}} Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices <b>he</b> <b>rarely</b> favoured family members; a policy that stood in contrast to the nepotism practiced by Vespasian and Titus. Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{reputation}} as an able politician and a likable man, during his presidency Pierce served only as a moderator among the increasingly bitter factions that were driving the nation towards civil war. To Pierce, who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality, the Union was sacred; because of this, he saw the actions of abolitionists, and the more moderate Free Soilers, as divisive and {{as a threat to}} the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of southerners. Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery, <b>he</b> <b>rarely</b> rebuked southern politicians who took extreme position or opposed northern interests.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950 campaign, both Nixon and Douglas {{were accused}} of having a voting record {{comparable}} to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio. The sole congressman from the American Labor Party at the time, Marcantonio represented East Harlem. He was accused of being a communist, though he denied being one; <b>he</b> <b>rarely</b> discussed the Soviet Union or communism. Marcantonio opposed restrictions on communists and the Communist Party, stating that such restrictions violated the Bill of Rights. He regularly voted against contempt citations requested by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), on which Nixon served.|$|E
50|$|The Cat in the Hat - Jack Roush, since <b>he</b> is <b>rarely</b> seen {{without his}} {{trademark}} Panama hat.|$|R
50|$|Some {{consider}} {{him to be}} the true discoverer of cell division, although <b>he</b> is <b>rarely</b> credited as such.|$|R
50|$|As a King of France, {{he would}} be {{numbered}} Hugh II; however, <b>he</b> is <b>rarely</b> referred to as such.|$|R
5|$|In 1881, Pullin married Alice Ramsden. The {{couple had}} four sons. He {{did not have}} many friends, {{but he was very}} close to the ones he had. His early {{association}} with churches, through his father, gave him an interest in ecclesiastical music; he often played the harmonium to entertain himself and his family. He had strong views on organ music, and once he had formed an opinion <b>he</b> <b>rarely</b> changed his mind.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 he was {{appointed}} as {{a research fellow at}} the Royal Frederick University. <b>He</b> <b>rarely</b> had responsibility for any teaching of the students, and since he was often busy with Norsk Forfatter-lexikon he remained a research fellow until 1907. In 1908 he took his dr.philos. degree on the thesis Die Stellung Norwegens und Schwedens im Deutsch-Dänischen Konflikt 1863–1864. Opponents at the dissertation were Ebbe Hertzberg and Yngvar Nielsen.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Borah {{became one}} of the {{progressive}} insurgents who challenged President William Howard Taft's policies, though Borah refused to support former president Theodore Roosevelt's third-party bid against Taft in 1912. Borah reluctantly voted for war in 1917 and, once it concluded, he fought against the Versailles treaty, and the Senate did not ratify it. Remaining a maverick, Borah often fought with the Republican presidents in office between 1921 and 1933, though Coolidge offered to make Borah his running mate in 1924. Borah campaigned for Hoover in 1928, something <b>he</b> <b>rarely</b> did for presidential candidates and never did again.|$|E
50|$|Herbert Travilla - Edward and Elsie's fifth child. He {{becomes a}} {{physician}} and after the first books <b>he</b> is <b>rarely</b> mentioned.|$|R
50|$|Walrus: A devoted {{friend of}} The Carpenter, <b>he</b> is <b>rarely</b> seen without {{him and was}} {{introduced}} at first as a villain.|$|R
50|$|Tolkien used dwarvish and dwarf(-) (e.g. Dwarf-lords, Old Dwarf Road) as {{adjectives}} for {{the people}} <b>he</b> created, <b>rarely</b> dwarven if ever.|$|R
5|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} Longstreet family in January 1862. A scarlet fever {{epidemic}} in Richmond, Virginia claimed {{the lives of}} his one-year-old daughter Mary Anne, his four-year-old son James, and eleven-year-old Augustus ("Gus"), all within a week. His 13-year-old son Garland almost succumbed. The losses were devastating for Longstreet and he became withdrawn, both personally and socially. In 1861 his headquarters were noted for parties, drinking, and poker games. After he returned from the funeral the headquarters social life became for a time more somber. <b>He</b> <b>rarely</b> drank, and he became a devout Episcopalian.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{contemporaneous}} Philippe de Commines, Matthias's subjects feared their King in {{the last}} years of his life because <b>he</b> <b>rarely</b> showed mercy towards those he suspected of treachery. He had Archbishop Peter Váradi imprisoned in 1484 and ordered the execution of his Chancellor of Bohemia Jaroslav Boskovic in 1485. He also imprisoned Nicholas Bánfi, a member of a magnate family, in 1487, although he had earlier avoided punishing the old aristocracy. Bánfi's imprisonment seems to have been connected to his marriage to a daughter of John the Mad, Duke of Glogau because Matthias tried to seize this duchy for John Corvinus. John the Mad entered into an alliance with the Duke of Münsterberg Henry of Poděbrady, and declared a war on Matthias on 9 May. Six month later, the Black Army invaded and occupied his duchy.|$|E
5|$|Borah {{considered}} challenging Hoover for renomination in 1932, but {{concluded the}} president's {{control over the}} party machinery, especially in the South, could not be overcome. Borah disagreed with the platform of the 1932 Republican National Convention over Prohibition; after the party passed a vague compromise plank and renominated Hoover, Borah made a major address on June 30, gaining nationwide attention by attacking his party's platform for forty minutes. Between then and November, <b>he</b> <b>rarely</b> mentioned Hoover's name publicly, though he said late in the campaign that he would vote for the president. He made speeches discussing issues, not candidates, and did nothing to aid Hoover's doomed campaign against Franklin D. Roosevelt. When some Idahoans demanded that he support Hoover on pain of being opposed for renomination for Senate in 1936, Borah responded that he regretted if his quarter century in the Senate had left them with the impression he might be moved by such an ultimatum.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a schoolboy}} at Eton College, Tennyson was a fast bowler, {{but by the}} time he took up regular {{first-class}} cricket with Hampshire in 1913, <b>he</b> bowled very <b>rarely.</b> <b>He</b> was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1914.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> {{reportedly}} <b>rarely</b> gave speeches from prepared notes and, instead, would ad-lib {{for hours}} to large crowds that often begged him for more.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Gronkle: a {{elderly and}} grouchy warthog who isn't fond of children. <b>He</b> is <b>rarely</b> {{compassionate}} and wants {{things to go}} his way.|$|R
5|$|Davis was 47 {{years old}} when he was asked to play Carnegie Hall in 1974, which {{followed}} four years of relentless touring. He had played the venue numerous times before and recorded a live album there in 1961. By 1974, Davis had been dealing with depression, cocaine and sex addictions, and several health problems, including osteoarthritis, bursitis, and sickle-cell anemia. He had also lost respect with both critics and his contemporaries because of his musical explorations into more rock- and funk-oriented sounds. Influenced by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Davis wanted to avoid individual songs and instead record extended movements that developed into a different composition. He played his trumpet sparsely and became less of the focal point for his band, whom he allowed more freedom to improvise and with whom <b>he</b> <b>rarely</b> rehearsed, so that the young musicians he enlisted would be tested to learn and play together onstage.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Fleetwood {{moved to}} London with Virginie {{and their son}} Louis. <b>He</b> <b>rarely</b> visited Lancashire again, and in 1847 he retired from politics. The family spent some time living in Virginie's home country, Spain. In 1861 Hesketh-Fleetwood {{expressed}} an intention to return to politics, but was prevented from doing so by his failing health. He died {{at his home in}} Piccadilly, London on 12 April 1866, following a lengthy illness. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. His son Rev. Peter Louis Hesketh-Fleetwood (1838–1880) succeeded to the baronetcy, which became extinct on his death. What was left of Hesketh-Fleetwood's land in Lancashire was bought by the Fleetwood Estate Company in 1875.|$|E
5|$|In 1787 Dennie was {{admitted}} to the sophomore class of Harvard College, where he was very popular with his peers. This popularity did not extend to his tutors, and he was suspended in December 1789 for six months after insulting the faculty. Dennie had difficulty finding suitable employment after earning his degree in 1790, but by 1793 he was practicing law (though earning very little for his work). In a January 1794 letter to his parents, however, Dennie reports that he had been appointed as a reader for the Episcopalian church in Charlestown, New Hampshire. Nevertheless, he insisted that this new vocation would not deter him from his goal of practicing law, though by then he was planning on remaining in New Hampshire to practice rather than returning to Massachusetts. Shortly after writing the letter, Dennie {{was admitted}} to the Court of Common Pleas and opened a practice in Charlestown. However, <b>he</b> <b>rarely</b> appeared in open court; indeed, he probably made only one appearance.|$|E
50|$|Jormanric: The Winglord of the Comitatus. He is {{described}} as being a big and burly man. <b>He</b> is <b>rarely</b> seen without eating ket.|$|R
50|$|From 1995 {{he worked}} as the Sports Editor at RTV Pink. Over the past years, due to his illness, <b>he</b> {{appeared}} <b>rarely</b> at Pink.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{controversy}} over Darkness in El Dorado, Tierney has kept a low profile. <b>He</b> has <b>rarely</b> appeared in public to defend his work.|$|R
