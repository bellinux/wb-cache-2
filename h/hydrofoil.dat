5|$|In {{response}} to the difficult position of the Yugoslav Navy vessels north of Šolta and Brač, the Vis TG led by Pula sailed north from the island of Vis to draw some of the artillery fire away from the Kaštela TG. As the ships approached the Split Entrance, they made a radar contact sailing away from Split towards open sea at a high speed. Pula, attempting to enforce the blockade imposed in September, requested the vessel by radio to stop for an inspection. The vessel failed to respond and Pula fired several shots {{in front of it}} before Brčić noticed that it was a <b>hydrofoil</b> carrying an ECMM team and flying the flag of Europe. He abandoned the pursuit and proceeded to Šolta.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Bond disguises {{himself as}} one of Largo's henchmen, and uncovers Largo's plan to destroy Miami Beach. Bond is {{discovered}} by Largo, but rescued by Leiter, who orders the United States Coast Guard to parachute to the area via US Air Force transport aircraft. After an underwater battle, the henchmen surrender. Largo escapes to his ship, which h{{as one of}} the bombs on board. As it begins to leave, Bond gets on underwater. The ship is pursued by Royal Navy and U.S. Coast Guard vessels, but Largo jettisons the rear of the ship, revealing the front as a <b>hydrofoil</b> as it escapes. Bond fights Largo on board, and he is about to shoot Bond when Domino, freed by Largo's nuclear physicist Ladislav Kutze, shoots Largo with a harpoon gun. Bond, Domino, and Kutze jump overboard, and the boat runs aground and explodes. A sky hook-equipped CIA B-17 aircraft then rescues Bond and Domino.|$|E
25|$|The first {{waterjet}} propelled Patrol Gunboat <b>Hydrofoil</b> Tucumcari (PGH-2) {{was built}} for operation by the Navy {{at a cost of}} $4 million by a Boeing subcontractor in Tacoma, Washington, and then assembled and outfitted at a Boeing facility in Seattle. Boeing's previous US Navy operated <b>hydrofoil</b> was the Patrol Craft <b>Hydrofoil</b> USS High Point (PCH-1), which utilized two forward hydrofoils and propellers on an aft-mounted single foil. Before that, Boeing had built and operated several hydroplane and <b>hydrofoil</b> test craft for itself and for the Navy.|$|E
5000|$|Early <b>hydrofoils</b> used V-shaped foils. <b>Hydrofoils</b> of {{this type}} are known as [...] "surface-piercing" [...] since {{portions}} of the V-shape <b>hydrofoils</b> rise above the water surface when foilborne. Some modern <b>hydrofoils</b> use fully submerged inverted T-shape foils. Fully submerged <b>hydrofoils</b> are less subject {{to the effects of}} wave action, and, therefore, more stable at sea and more comfortable for crew and passengers. This type of configuration, however, is not self-stabilizing. The angle of attack on the <b>hydrofoils</b> must be adjusted continuously to changing conditions, a control process performed by sensors, a computer, and active surfaces.|$|R

25|$|Sachsenberg and Shertel {{set up a}} new <b>hydrofoil</b> {{operation}} named Supramar in Switzerland. In 1953, {{they finally}} saw the first commercial <b>hydrofoil</b> in operation between Ascona, Switzerland, and Arona, Italy, on Lake Maggiore. The <b>hydrofoil</b> concept gradually spread worldwide, but Sachsenberg did not live to see its general use. He died in Bremen of a heart attack on 23 August 1961.|$|E
25|$|Eric Walters' The <b>Hydrofoil</b> Mystery (1999) sets a {{novel in}} Alexander Graham Bell's workshops, casting the <b>hydrofoil</b> {{as a new}} weapon of war being readied for use against German U-boats during the First World War.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1930s, Sachsenberg allied {{himself with}} <b>hydrofoil</b> ship pioneer Hanns von Schertel. <b>Hydrofoil</b> ship speeds {{of more than}} 30 knots, faster than any {{warships}} then on water, attracted attention from the German Ministry of Transportation and Finance, the German Navy, and German Air Force. Commercial exploitation of the <b>hydrofoil</b> was cut short by World War II. Several military hydrofoils of differing sizes, with speeds up to 60 knots, were acquired during World War II. However, they were only prototypes, and most fell prey to war damage of some sort.|$|E
50|$|When the Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company {{introduced}} <b>hydrofoils</b> to the Manly {{service in}} the mid-1960s, a pontoon {{was attached to the}} eastern side of wharf 2 to allow the <b>hydrofoils</b> to berth without their foils fouling the wharf. This was removed when the <b>hydrofoils</b> were replaced by JetCats in 1991.|$|R
50|$|While most human-powered {{watercraft}} use buoyancy {{to maintain}} their position relative {{to the surface of}} the water, a few, such as human-powered <b>hydrofoils</b> and human-powered submarines, use <b>hydrofoils,</b> either alone or in addition to buoyancy.|$|R
50|$|The first {{generation}} Westamaran catamarans {{were not as}} quick as the competing <b>hydrofoils,</b> but their capacity was larger, maintenance easier, and they were more comfortable. The second generation catamarans, with symmetrical hulls, matched the <b>hydrofoils</b> in speed, reaching 35-40 knots.|$|R
25|$|Tucumcari {{returned}} to San Diego in March, 1970 and operated off {{the west coast}} until transferred to the Atlantic Fleet in August. After operating off the east coast into 1971, Tucumcari was slated to deploy to northern Europe and to the Mediterranean to demonstrate the capability of <b>hydrofoil</b> propulsion for other NATO nations. It was hoped that the demonstration would stimulate the development and production of a NATO guided missile <b>hydrofoil.</b>|$|E
25|$|A similar hull {{design was}} used by Saunders-Roe in a prototype, R-103, {{which led to the}} {{development}} of the experimental <b>hydrofoil,</b> , for the Royal Canadian Navy.|$|E
25|$|Brighton {{has several}} railway stations, many bus routes, coach {{services}} and taxis. A Rapid Transport System {{has been under}} consideration for some years. Trolleybuses, trams, ferries and <b>hydrofoil</b> services have operated in the past.|$|E
50|$|A new kayak design, called Flyak, has <b>hydrofoils</b> that {{lift the}} kayak enough to {{significantly}} reduce drag, allowing speeds {{of up to}} 27 km/h. Some surfers have developed surfboards with <b>hydrofoils</b> called foilboards, specifically aimed at surfing big waves further out to sea.|$|R
50|$|In 1984/85, two 235-seat <b>hydrofoils,</b> Manly IV and Sydney entered service. The State Transit Authority {{replaced}} its remaining <b>hydrofoils</b> {{with three}} JetCats, {{with the last}} operating on 18 March 1991. The remaining vessels were sold for further service on the Mediterranean Sea.|$|R
50|$|Nye {{founded and}} was {{president}} of North American <b>Hydrofoils</b> which designed and built the U.S.'s first commuter <b>hydrofoils,</b> named Enterprise and Endeavour, in 1961. These two prototype vessels were commissioned to shuttle commuters from Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey to Wall Street in Manhattan.|$|R
25|$|Flyak – <b>hydrofoil</b> {{adaptation}} to the conventional kayak. It uses twin hydrofoils designed to raise the hull {{out of the water}} to increase the speed. Speeds of up to 27.2km/h (7.6m·s−1, 16.9mph) can be achieved on calm water.|$|E

50|$|Until the mid-1960s, ferries docked at {{both sides}} of the wharf. When the Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company {{introduced}} <b>hydrofoils</b> to the Manly service in the mid-1960s, a pontoon was attached to the eastern side to allow the <b>hydrofoils</b> to berth without their foils fouling the wharf. This was removed when the <b>hydrofoils</b> were replaced by JetCats in 1991. When the Freshwater class ferries were introduced in the 1980s, the western berth was rebuilt to accommodate their onboard gangways.|$|R
5000|$|One of Be-8 was {{equipped}} with <b>hydrofoils,</b> developed at TsAGI. These [...] "Underwater Wings" [...] were installed on landing gear struts and raised the aircraft above the water, well before the aerodynamic lift could support the aircraft. As a result, takeoff was much easier and imposed less punishment on the hull from the waves. Despite being very effective during take-off, the <b>hydrofoils</b> resulted in increased drag {{and a reduction in}} maximum airspeed. Construction of retractable <b>hydrofoils</b> was not ready, and the concept did not find practical applications.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the city}} neighborhoods is Paquetá Island, {{which can only be}} {{accessed}} by ferryboats or <b>hydrofoil</b> boats. The ferryboat to Paquetá leaves every hour, from early in the morning until around midnight. There is also a ferry to Cocotá.|$|E

2500|$|At age 14, Fittipaldi {{was racing}} motorcycles, and at 16, <b>hydrofoils.</b> While racing one day, his brother Wilson took off at [...] and landed upside down. Afterwards, they both decided that {{although}} he had survived, they would no longer race <b>hydrofoils,</b> and moved onto racing karts.|$|R
50|$|Multihull sailboats {{can also}} employ <b>hydrofoils</b> only to assist performance. Just as daggerboards and rudders are foils that enhance {{the control of}} a boat, {{assisting}} <b>hydrofoils</b> provide lift to the hull to reduce the wetted area without actually lifting the boat {{completely out of the}} water.|$|R
25|$|Another use of foils is {{to provide}} lift, turning the boat into a <b>hydrofoil.</b> Hydrofoils require {{significant}} speeds to work, but once the hull is lifted out of the water, the drag is significantly reduced. Many speed sailing designs {{have been based on}} a proa type configuration equipped with lifting foils.|$|E
25|$|The other ferry {{service to}} Fukuoka is assumed by the Beetles and the Kobees, 2 fleets of {{high-speed}} hydrofoils operated by Miraejet. About five departures from each city are scheduled every day. By <b>hydrofoil</b> {{it only takes}} 2 hours 55 minutes to cross the Korea Strait to Fukuoka. The Beetles are owned by JR Kyushu.|$|E
25|$|The drag {{coefficient}} of any object comprises {{the effects of}} the two basic contributors to fluid dynamic drag: skin friction and form drag. The {{drag coefficient}} of a lifting airfoil or <b>hydrofoil</b> also includes the effects of lift-induced drag. The drag coefficient of a complete structure such as an aircraft also includes the effects of interference drag.|$|E
5000|$|At age 14, Fittipaldi {{was racing}} motorcycles, and at 16, <b>hydrofoils.</b> While racing one day, his brother Wilson took off at 70 mi/h km/h and landed upside down.
