30|$|Recently, {{among the}} {{photovoltaic}} cells considered as renewable energy sources, organic photovoltaic cells such as nanoscale polymer semiconductors have been intensively developed [1]. As alternative technologies to conventional photovoltaic cells, polymer bulk-heterojunction [BHJ] photovoltaic cells have gained great attention {{since they have}} several advantages such as low-cost fabrication, mechanical flexibility [2, 3], and easy fabrication process including spin-coating [4]. The BHJ-structured device is an <b>intimate</b> <b>blend</b> of donor and acceptor materials that are phase-separated into nanodomains, where one or both materials absorb photons to form bound electron-hole pairs (excitons). An interpenetrating network in the BHJ structure provides a large interfacial area for efficient exciton dissociation [5, 6], leading to high efficiency of device performance.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Blends of nylon- 6 and {{inorganic}} salt (composition range 0 – 10 % by weight) were prepared by melt processing at 230 C, forming an <b>intimate</b> <b>blend</b> {{of the two}} components. The structure of the blend was investigated by using FTIR and WAXD techniques. The formation of a nitrogen atom–metal ion coordination bond {{is seen in the}} FTIR spectrum. X-ray analysis showed the decrease of the nylon- 6 crystallinity due to the existence of the coordination bond. The hygroscopicity of the nylon- 6 blend increases sharply with the increase in salt addition.

The batch composition corresponds to an <b>intimate</b> <b>blend</b> of tri-isopropoxy boron, ethyl acetoacetate chelating agent, and isopropyl alcohol molecularly mixed using intense, contact-mode probe-type ultrasonication at 135 watts ultrasonic power. Chelation serves to retard the runaway alkoxide hydrolysis and sonogel the boria sol, gelling in which has so far not been reported due to its small molecular size and its amphoteric characteristics. The hydrolysis water was added at 0. 4 ml/h/g of alkoxide under controlled conditions of temperature, atmosphere and humidity. About 100 μl of samples in varying stages of sonogelling were injected between two 300 -mesh transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grids mounted on 0. 1 mm copper plates and plunged into melting freon at − 160 °C to cause a rapid solidification without vitrification. The sample was cryo-transferred into a scanning electron microscope (SEM), equipped with a liquid N 2 cold stage maintained at − 170 °C. Cryo-SEM imaging at the sonogelling point shows a polymeric networking similar to that in alumina gels synthesized from aluminum sec-butoxide. © Elsevie...|$|E
40|$|To {{achieve a}} high living {{standard}} {{for all people}} on Earth access to low cost energy is essential. The massive {{burning of fossil fuels}} must be drastically reduced if we are to avoid large changes of our climate. Solar cells are both technologically mature and have the potential to meet the huge demand for renewable energy in many countries. The prices for silicon solar cells have decreased rapidly {{during the course of this}} thesis and are now in grid parity in many countries. However, the potential for even lower energy costs has driven the research on polymer solar cells, a class of thin film solar cells. Polymer solar cells can be produced by roll to roll printing which potentially enables truly low cost solar cells. However, much research and development remain to reach that target. Polymer solar cells consist of a semiconducting composite material sandwiched between two electrodes, of which one is transparent, to let the light energy in to the semiconductor where it is converted to electric energy. The semiconductor comprise an <b>intimate</b> <b>blend</b> of polymer and fullerenes, where the nanostructure of this blend is crucial for the photo current extraction. To reach higher solar cell performance the dominating strategy is development and fine tuning of new polymers. To estimate their potential as solar cell materials their optical response have been determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry. Furthermore, optical simulations have been performed where the direction dependency of the optical response of the transparent electrode material PEDOT:PSS have been accounted for. The simulations show reduced electrode losses for light incident at large oblique angles. Moreover, we have shown that a gentle annealing of the active layer induces a local conformational changes of an amorphous polymer that is beneficial for solar cell performance. The active layer is deposited from solution where the drying kinetics determine the final nanostructure. We have shown that using in-situ photoluminescence phase separation can be detected during the drying process while a reflectance method have been developed to image lateral variations of solvent evaporation rate. Imaging methods are important tools to detect performance variations over the solar cell area. For this purpose an intermodulation based photo current imaging method have been developed to qualitatively differentiate the major photo current loss mechanisms. In addition, a 1 D LED-array photo current imaging method have been developed and verified for high speed in-line characterization of printed organic solar modules. The corrections in the published errata list are implemented in the electronic version. </p...|$|E

To date, poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), a bioresorbable synthetic poly(α-hydroxyester), is considered one of the most promising materials for vascular tissue engineering. In this work, the potential advantage of <b>intimate</b> <b>blending</b> soft PCL and hard poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), a polymer of microbial origin, has been evaluated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Laminates with {{unidirectional}} (UD) fiber {{orientation of}} three differ-ent commingled yarns, comprising poly(amide- 12) and poly(butylene-terephthalate) fibers blended with stretch broken carbon fibers (CF), were produced at different processing conditions. The achieved laminate quality was evaluated {{by means of}} void content measurement, mechanical testing along and transverse to the fiber direction, and optical microscopy. It was found that – under the investigated processing conditions – the cooling/consolidation time is not sufficiently long to obtain laminates with satisfactorily low void content, unless a commingled yarn with exceptionally <b>intimate</b> <b>blending</b> quality is employed. Incomplete fiber impregnation resulted in a drastic decrease of transverse tensile strength as compared with values obtained for compression-molded reference laminates. Stamp forming of carbon and poly(butylene-terephthalate) fiber commingled yarn with extraordinary degree of commingling delivered laminates with as low void contents as 1 % at some processing conditions, but fiber–matrix adhesion was not satisfactory. Nevertheless, the presented carbon and poly(butylene-terephthalate) fiber commingled yarn offers great potential to be successively processed by stamp forming, as the interfacial adhesion problem {{is expected to be}} solved by using optimized fiber sizing...|$|R

40|$|Manufactured fibers {{comprise}} {{a broad spectrum}} of products with an almost endless potential for engineering in specific physical, chemical and aesthetic properties. World fiber consumption is about 40 + % cotton; 40 + % polyester; 7 - 8 % nylon, with all the other fibers representing only about 10 % of the total (Table 1). So it is obvious that both cotton and polyester are very important, whether used alone or together. Historically, fiber manufacturers and cotton producers have focused on the competitive aspects of the marketplace. However, there have also been notable successes for materials containing both fiber types. When mixed in <b>intimate</b> <b>blends,</b> the advantages of different fiber types can be combined to yield superior fabric properties. Cotton/polyester blend fabrics are the quintessential example of utilizing the best attributes of both fibers to produce fabrics with price, performance and aesthetics not achievable with either fiber alone. Similarly, flame resistant fabrics and high-loft battings have been developed using the char forming ability of FR cotton enhanced by the flame poisoning ability of modacrylics and/or FR polyesters. And more complex ternary and quaternary fiber blends are in use to produc...|$|R

The average CV is 4. 84 % which shows {{a significant reduction in}} feed components for the samples tested. The degree of mixing attained was 95. 16 % which portrays an improvement of about 7. 8 % reduction in non-uniformity of components among samples when the mixing duration was 10 min.

40|$|There is {{interest}} {{in the use of}} sugar cane waste biomass for electricity cogeneration, by integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) processes. This paper describes one aspect of an overall investigation into the reactivity of cane wastes under pressurized IGGC conditions, for input into process design. There is currently a gap in understanding the morphological transformations experienced by cane waste biomass undergoing conversion to char during pressurized gasification, which is addressed by this work. Char residuals remaining after pressurized pyrolysis and carbon dioxide gasification were analysed by optical microscope, nitrogen (BET) adsorption analysis, SEM/EDS, TEM/EDS and XPS techniques. The amorphous cane plant silica structures were found to remain physically intact during entrained flow gasification, but chemically altered in the presence of other inorganic species. The resulting crystalline silicates were mesoporous (with surface areas of the order of 20 m(2) g(- 1)) and contributed to much of the otherwise limited pore volume present in the residual chars. Coke deposition and <b>intimate</b> <b>blending</b> of the carbonaceous and inorganic species was identified. Progressive sintering of the silicates appeared to trap coke deposits in the pore network. As a result ash residuals showed significant organic contents, even after extensive additional oxidation in air. The implications of the findings are that full conversion of cane trash materials under pressurized IGCC conditions may be significantly hampered by the silica structures inherent in these biomass materials and that further research of the contributing phenomena is recommended...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{summarize}} {{our recent}} studies employing the cyclic starches called cyclodextrins (CDs) to both nanostructure and functionalize polymers. Two important structural characteristics of CDs are taken as advantages {{to achieve these}} goals. First the ability of CDs to form non-covalent inclusion complexes (ICs) {{with a variety of}} guest molecules, including many polymers, by threading and inclusion into their relatively hydrophobic interior cavities, which are roughly cylindrical with diameters of ∼ 0. 5 to 1. 0 nm for α-, β-, and γ-CD containing 6, 7, and 8 α- 1, 4 -linked glucose units, respectively. When guest polymers are coalesced from the CD-ICs by removing their host CDs, they are observed to solidify with structures, morphologies, and even conformations that are distinct from bulk samples made from their solutions and melts. Molecularly mixed, <b>intimate</b> <b>blends</b> of two or more polymers that are normally immiscible can be obtained from their common CD-ICs, and the phase segregation of incompatible blocks can be controlled (suppressed or increased) in CD-IC coalesced block copolymers. In addition, additives may be more effectively delivered to polymers in the form of their soluble or crystalline CD-ICs or rotaxanes. Secondly, many –OH groups attached to the exterior rims of CDs, in addition to conferring water solubility, provide an opportunity to covalently bond them to polymers either during their syntheses or via post-polymerization reactions. Polymers containing CDs in their backbones or attached to their side chains are observed to more readily accept and retain additives, such as dyes, fragrances, etc. They may also be further reacted or treated through their CDs to cross-link and form networks or to form blends with other polymers having a propensity to thread through their attached CD cavities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that the current uncertainty hovering over the property industry is not simply {{the result of an}} internal economic dynamic, dooming the industry to damaging booms and slumps. Rather, the novel sense of 'risk' colouring contemporary development activities is the consequence of wider cultural, technical and commercial shifts from which property development is not immune. The current supply-oriented interests of property research, predominantly concerned with the collection and analysis of statistical data, are unable to respond to these wider questions. Simply creating more 'data banks' will not help. The paper argues that {{in order to understand the}} shifting nature of demand, property research needs to complement econometric modelling with a more occupier-focused 'marketing research'â€”one that is sensitive to the dynamics of the 'risk society' we now inhabit. Accordingly, the paper provides a detailed account of structured market research, which should form part of a broader property research agenda. In particular, structured demand analysis is shown to provide a framework for understanding the complex dynamics of the demand market, so demonstrating how the supply industry can improve its efficiency.
