2500|$|...The Lady made a {{sign for}} me to approach; but I was seized with fear, and I did not dare, {{thinking}} that I was faced with an illusion. <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> my eyes, but in vain. I looked again, and I could still see the same Lady. Then I put my hand into my pocket, and took my rosary.

6000|$|... "When I {{had taken}} the copy, <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> out the marks, but, two mornings later, a fresh {{inscription}} had appeared. I {{have a copy of}} it here:" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, mother, how be you? I {{felt like}} a boy again, {{waking up in the}} old chamber. Where's my back and breast-piece? Have you a cup of ale, while <b>I</b> <b>rub</b> it up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, just oblige me: {{let me try}} {{what there}} is in luck. Go on playing while <b>I</b> <b>rub</b> up my Arabic, and try to read this ineffable name on the case. Is it the word of Power of Solomon?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{that night}} when the {{stranger}} came home with our Jane [...] I might SEE what I HEARD then, that sounded so plain-- [...] Like when my wet fingers <b>I</b> <b>rub</b> on the pane [...] (Which they won't let ME do on my window).|$|R

60|$|Giatron {{hastened to}} the door of the office and called to a passing waiter. The napkin was soon {{procured}} and <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> myself dry. The restaurant keeper returned to the desk at Mr. Bundercombe's side.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am not so}} sure of Gillian. There's {{something}} amiss, though I can't {{make out}} whether it is merely that <b>I</b> <b>rub</b> her down the wrong way. I wonder whether this holiday time will do us good or harm! At any rate, I know how Lily felt about Dolores.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{me about}} it. I like sad stories, and I already {{feel as if}} I belonged to the family, a loyal {{retainer}} as in the old times. While you dust the books and <b>I</b> <b>rub</b> the mold off this old cover, tell me the tale, please, Mrs. Hester." ...|$|R

60|$|She {{never heard}} my apology or my entreaty. There {{was a kind}} of glory in her eyes. Looking at her, I found a dimness hazing my sight, and when <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> it away it came back.|$|E
60|$|Out I {{started to}} thrust my head, but a sharp blow on the {{forehead}} caused me to recoil. <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> my bruised brow and gazed with reproachful inquiry at Paul, who was laughing in gleeful, boyish fashion.|$|E
60|$|He {{pointed to}} the palette lying on his work-table. Different shades of black {{pigments}} were brushed on it. One, in particular, I could hardly see. It gave my eyes a blurring sensation, and <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> them and looked again.|$|E
60|$|Well! It {{was only}} {{their love for}} me, I know very well, {{and it is a}} long time ago. I must write it even if <b>I</b> <b>rub</b> it out again, because it gives me so much pleasure.

6000|$|But {{this vision}} of an ideal feast {{was too much for}} her, and she swooned away, poor thing. <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> snow in her face and brought her to, and after a while got her {{excitement}} cooled down. By-and-by she drifted into her story again: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will get}} some grease, señor, from Maria, and then <b>I</b> will <b>rub</b> your shoulders, and arms; that will do you {{a great deal of}} good." ...|$|R
