Therefore, this paper investigates how effective a laser source is in reducing the extent of springback in mechanical contact forming operations. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>forming</b> process investigated was composed of using a high-power diode laser to induce local heating of mechanically bent AA 6108 T 4 thin sheets {{in order to minimize}} the extent of the springback. In particular, experiments were carried out to assess the influence of the leading process parameters such as laser source power, scan speed, and starting elastic deformation of the mechanically bent sheets. It was found that the trends in the experimental response of residual deflection were always consistent with the operating parameters. Artificial intelligence techniques were then used to model the <b>hybrid</b> <b>forming</b> process. The extent of the springback in the <b>hybrid</b> <b>forming</b> process of AA 6108 T 4 thin sheets was predicted by using different neural network models and training algorithms. Lastly, the reliability of the best neural network solutions was checked by comparing these solutions with experimental results and by developing an ad hoc first approximation technical model...|$|E

The Collaborative Research Centre SFB/TR 39 PT-PIESA is {{developing}} mass production technologies and process chains for the fabrication of aluminium piezo composites, {{which can be}} used as raw material for "smart sheet metal " [1]. Microstructuring by forming is a challenging task con-cerning material flow, tool and process design [2]. In this study, a <b>hybrid</b> <b>forming</b> process combined of micro impact extrusion and shear displacement is presented and discussed. The formed microstructure consists of ten parallel primary cavities with cross sections of 0. 3 0. 3 mm 2 and four larger secondary cavities which are surrounding the primary cavities. High demands are made concerning precision and reproducibility of the cavities ' geometry according to the function of the cavities, which is to serve as collets for sensitive piezo rods. The microstructure has to be formed with one stroke of the stamp. Micro backward impact extrusion is chosen for structuring the primary cavities since it allows accu-rate forming without aligning die plate and stamp due to a flat die plate. Shear displacement forming, which is the selected process for the secondary cavities, requires a structured and aligned die plate but the forming forces are significantly lower than forming the same geometry with an extrusion process, which in turn increases the accuracy. The investigations are focused on the characterization of samples formed with the hybrid process in comparison to structures which are formed solely by impact extru-sion. Geometric parameters, material flow and process parameters were evaluated to assess the hybrid process. First experiments show promising results, whereas higher degrees of deformation could be reached at lower forming forces...|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{deals with the}} control of springback phenomena in the bending process of aluminium sheets by <b>hybrid</b> <b>forming</b> process. Metal substrates were pre-bent to nominal shapes on a built-ad-hoc mould after being constrained on it. Then, they were post-treated by high power diode laser to prevent the deformation of the pre-bent sheets {{after the release of}} the constraints. The extent of springback phenomena were estimated by measuring the difference between the nominal bending angles and those achieved on the unconstrained substrates after laser post-treatments. Analytical models, aimed at predicting the springback by varying the setting of the operational parameters of the forming process, were developed. Neural network solutions were also proposed to improve the matching between experimental and numerical data, with the Multi-Layer Perceptrons trained by Back-Propagation algorithm being the fittest one. On this basis, a control modulus very useful to practitioners for automation and simulation purposes was built-on. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHydroforging is a <b>hybrid</b> <b>forming</b> {{operation}} whereby a thick tube {{is formed}} {{to a desired}} geometry by combining forging and hydroforming processes.

An analytical model for determining pressure-feed loading paths is formulated for the hydroforging process. The model is derived based of plasticity theory and deformed shape evolution. Stepwise solution schemes are used to calculate instantaneous pressure, material feed, stresses, strains, and other geometrical parameters. The derived analytical model can be used for preliminary process design before embarking in extensive FE simulations. The model is also ideal for rapid establishment of loading paths for different geometrical configurations. Thus, time spent in trial-and-error finite element simulations carried out to determine optimal loading path for a specific part can be reduced significantly...|$|E

The study was focused on AA 6082 T 6 aluminium thin sheets. In most dynamic sheet metal forming operations, the highly nonlinear deformation processes cause large amounts of elastic strain energy stored in the formed material. The novel <b>hybrid</b> <b>forming</b> process was thus aimed at inducing the local heating of the mechanically bent workpiece in order to decrease or eliminate the related springback phenomena. In particular, the influence {{on the extent of}} springback phenomena of laser process parameters such as source power, scan speed and starting elastic deformation of mechanically bent sheets, was experimentally assessed. Consistent trends in experimental response according to operational parameters were found. Accordingly, 3 D process maps of the extent of the springback phenomena according to operational parameters were constructed. The effect of the inherent uncertainties on the predicted residual bending caused by the approximation in the model parameters was evaluated. In particular, a fuzzy-logic based approach was used to describe the model uncertainties and the transformation method was applied to propagate their effect on the residual bending...|$|E

The goal of {{this study}} was to use iPad {{technology}} to collect real-time data in order to estimate and compare how faculty time was spent two Doctor of Physical Therapy programs [...] one delivered via a traditional face-to-face format, the other via a <b>hybrid</b> <b>forming</b> involving the use of online technology in addition to face-to-face interactions. Background. There is little information about how faculty members in physical therapist education programs allocate their time among teaching, scholarship, service, and administration. We studied faculty in two types of entry-level DPT Programs offered at the same private university. One program is a Traditional Program, delivered primarily through on-campus face-to-face interaction. The other is a Hybrid Program, where students come to campus once a month for four days of full-time face-to-face interaction; otherwise, content is delivered through a variety of online tools and technology. Methods. An observational work sampling method was used to collect data. A taxonomy of work as a faculty member in a DPT program was created and used to design a framework of categories for data collection. Major task categories were teaching, research, service, administration, and other. Under each major task category, codes for relevant activities were created; e. g., course developmen...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic (EM) forming is a {{high-speed}} forming process {{that uses the}} forces induced on a conductive workpiece by a transient high frequency magnetic field to form the workpiece into a desired shape. It has been reported by several researchers that EM forming (EMF) increases the formability of hard-to-form aluminum alloy sheet under certain circumstances. EMF can be combined with conventional forming (e. g. stamping) operations to create a <b>hybrid</b> <b>forming</b> operation that exploits the strengths of each process. One such operation is the “corner fill” operation, which consists in pre-forming sheet using conventional forming and then using EMF to reduce the radii of different features on the part to values {{that could not be}} obtained with conventional forming. This paper describes the development of a coil used for a hybrid operation that consisted on pre-forming AA 5754 1 mm into a v-shape with a 20 mm outer radius and then reducing or “sharpening” the radius to 5 mm using EMF. The coil {{is one of the most}} important components of an EMF operation, since it is the means of delivering the energy to the workpiece. Coils are subjected to very high stresses and are typically the element of an EMF operation that will fail first. One successful and four unsuccessful coils designs are presented. The successful coil was a single loop design, with the section closest to the part narrowed to increase the current density. The simplicity of the shape was chosen for its current flow characteristics and for its structural strength...|$|E

Immunological {{paralysis}} against type VIII and immunity against type III Diplococcus pneumoniae {{induced by}} the soluble specific substance of type VIII. J. Bacteriol. 90 : 1296 – 1303. 1965. —Mice injected with relatively large quantities of the soluble specific substance of type VIII Diplococcus pneumoniae (SVIII) are, {{on the basis of}} challenge experiments, paralyzed against type VIII but immune against type III D. pneumoniae. Their sera contain antibodies which react with sheep cells coated with SIII. Unfortunately, {{it was not possible to}} develop an in vitro test with SVIII. When the SVIII was treated with a specific SVIII depolymerase before injection into mice, the sera still contained antibodies against SIII and some protection was afforded these mice against type III but not against type VIII challenge. When the SVIII was treated with a specific SIII depolymerase, antibodies were not detectable and the mice were not protected against type III or type VIII challenge. On the basis of these results it is suggested that either the SVIII strain is a <b>hybrid</b> <b>forming</b> both SVIII and SIII molecules or that part of the SVIII chain is altered to consist of repeating units of cellobiuronic acid rather than alternating units of cellobiuronic acid and the disaccharide galactose-glucose. The quantity of SIII in some preparations of SVIII is calculated to be of the order of 0. 01 %. It is not clear whether all type VIII strains at all times possess the capacity to elicit antibodies which react specifically against SIII, or if this is the property of only some strains and some preparations of these strains...|$|E
