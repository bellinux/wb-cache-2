50|$|This <b>display</b> <b>console</b> was a {{significant}} departure from conventional computer consoles of the time, which contained hundreds of blinking lights and switches for every state bit in the machine. (See Front panel for an example.) By comparison, the 6000 series console was an elegant design; simple, fast and reliable.|$|E
50|$|The Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) Division of the U.S. Army Signal Center and School (USASCS) at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey {{evaluated}} CAI's {{success in}} teaching basic electronics by using material {{presented in the}} tutorial mode on the IBM 1500 System, utilizing the IBM Coursewriter language, an IBM 1510 <b>Display</b> <b>Console,</b> and an IBM 1512 Image Projector.|$|E
50|$|While Victor did {{not learn}} to speak the {{language}} that Itard tried to teach him, it seems that Victor did make progress in his behavior towards other people. At the Itard home, housekeeper Madame Guérin was setting the table one evening while crying {{over the loss of}} her husband. Victor stopped what he was doing and <b>displayed</b> <b>consoling</b> behavior towards her. Itard reported on this progress.|$|R
5000|$|ARTS was {{developed}} in the late 1960s by Univac corporation to help automate the TRACONS operations in the United States. At many TRACONs, a Unisys mainframe computer was installed to handle the processing. In the early 1970s virtually all TRACONs in the US were running ARTS software to help track aircraft displayed on the radar console. The Burroughs Corporation was also working on radar <b>display</b> <b>consoles</b> in the 1970s to 1980s.|$|R
50|$|DOCS (<b>Display</b> Operator <b>Console</b> Support) was a {{software}} package for IBM mainframes by CFS Inc., enabling {{access to the}} system console using 3270-compatible terminals.|$|R
50|$|Controls {{in older}} systems contain {{a large number}} of {{individual}} motor control buttons, with efficient operation requiring a high degree of operator skill and experience. Modern control consoles are much simpler, with only a few buttons, a graphic <b>display</b> <b>console,</b> and a single multi-axis joystick, with an overall appearance similar to that of a video game console in a video arcade.|$|E
50|$|The CDC 6000 series {{computer}} {{is composed of}} four main functional devices: the central memory, one or two high-speed central processors, seven to ten peripheral processors (Peripheral Processing Unit, or PPU), and a <b>display</b> <b>console.</b> The four computer types differ primarily {{in the number of}} and kind of central processor. It had a distributed architecture and was a reduced instruction set (RISC) machine many years before such a term was invented.|$|E
5000|$|This baroque {{style of}} front panels began to die out in 1964 when Seymour Cray {{designed}} his CDC 6600 supercomputer {{with a very}} simple and elegant <b>display</b> <b>console</b> containing only 2 CRT displays and a keyboard, replacing all the hundreds of switches, buttons, and blinking lights. The 6600 had support from ten supporting [...] "peripheral processors" [...] whose duties included reading the keyboard and driving the graphics displays.|$|E

The stored data can be viewed on the LCD display, or sent to a PC. Some photosynthesis systems allow communication over the internet using standard internet communication protocols.|$|R
50|$|Most small {{systems were}} sold with an IBM 1052-7 as the console typewriter. This was tightly {{integrated}} into the CPU — the keyboard would physically lock under program control. Certain high-end machines could optionally be purchased with a 2250 graphical display, costing upwards of US $100,000. The 360/85 used a 5450 <b>display</b> <b>console</b> that was not compatible with {{anything else in the}} line; the later 3066 console for the 370/165 and 370/168 used the same basic display design as the 360/85.|$|E
50|$|This {{class is}} the first Chinese {{submarine}} to be fitted with an integrated electronic support measures / radio direction finder / radar warning receiver system designated as SRW209 Submarine Radar Reconnaissance Equipment, which works at S - Ku bands with 100% detection rate. The SRW209 is fully automatic and can be either operated by a single operator with a console with a color CRT (which can be replaced by LCD) <b>display</b> <b>console,</b> or linked to the combat data system, which is capable of tracking multiple targets.|$|E
50|$|The {{first to}} {{transfer}} 3D visualization {{technology to the}} medical imaging industry. Implemented {{an early version of}} the software package DISPLAY82 (developed with a major role played by me at MIPG) on an Independent Physician <b>Display</b> <b>Console</b> (IPDC) of the General Electric (GE) CT Scanners in 1979 and in 1980. This was the earliest attempt to bring to use the 3D visualization technology via medical imaging scanner manufacturers. Subsequently, {{played a major role in}} developing software packages called 3D82, 3D83 and 3D98 all designed to run on the GE IPDC. This had a major impact on the industrialization of medical 3D visualization.|$|E
50|$|ASR data is {{displayed}} on Automated Radar Terminal System (ARTS), Common Automated Radar Terminal System (CARTS), and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) <b>display</b> <b>consoles</b> in control towers and Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) rooms, usually located at airports. CARTS {{will be replaced}} with STARS at all TRACONs during TAMR Phase 3 - Segment 1 as announced by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the Spring of 2011. All remaining ARTS (IIE) sites will be replaced with STARS during TAMR Phase 3 Segment 2 as announced by the FAA in the Spring of 2013.|$|R
50|$|The {{combat system}} {{develops}} doctrine-based response recommendations {{based on the}} current tactical situation and sends the recommendations to the DBR. The combat system also has control of which modes the radar will perform. Unlike previous-generation radars, the DBR does not require an operator and has no manned <b>display</b> <b>consoles.</b> The system uses information about the current environment and doctrine from the combat system to make automated decisions, not only reducing reaction times, but also reducing {{the risks associated with}} human error. The only human interaction is for maintenance and repair activities.|$|R
50|$|The ACDS upgrade {{is divided}} into two phases {{designated}} as Block 0 and Block 1. The Block 0 system replaces obsolete Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) computers and <b>display</b> <b>consoles</b> with modern equipment and incorporates both new and upgraded NTDS software. Block 1 operates with the equipment provided under ACDS Block 0 but implements significant improvements in software capability. The Block 1 upgrade includes modifiable doctrine, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) for joint and allied interoperability, increased range and track capability, multi-source identification, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) based digital maps, and an embedded training capability.|$|R
50|$|However, {{equipping}} {{the entire}} Royal Canadian Navy's fleet {{would be extremely}} expensive. Production machines would likely be cheaper than $1.9 million prototype cost if produced in any sort of production run. In order to lower the overall cost, the Navy wanted to spread the development costs across a larger production line, and invited representatives of the Royal Navy and US Navy to view the system. They proved to be equally impressed; one US officer was too impressed and looked under the <b>display</b> <b>console,</b> believing the display was being faked. But no matter how impressed they were, it appears they felt they could do better on their own, and declined to get involved. The Royal Navy would start work on their Comprehensive Display System that year {{under the direction of}} Elliot Brothers, and the US Navy's Naval Tactical Data System in 1956.|$|E
