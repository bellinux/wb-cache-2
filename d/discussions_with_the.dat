5|$|Aberdeen {{approached}} Craig Brown, who {{was working}} without a contract at Motherwell, to replace McGhee. Brown initially rebuffed an offer, but after further <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> club Brown resigned as manager at Motherwell to be announced as the next manager at Aberdeen two days later. The first act of the new management team of Brown and Archie Knox was to re-instate Leighton.

5|$|As the British {{government}} has no legal jurisdiction, it requires the local residents to form a representative committee according {{to the laws of}} the long-defunct dukedom before negotiating with them. Ancient Burgundian law requires that the Duke himself appoint a council. Sébastien de Charolais arrives and presents his claim to the title, which is verified by Professor Hatton-Jones. He forms the governing body which includes the local policeman, Spiller, and the manager of the bank branch, Mr. Wix; the neighbourhood shop keeper, Arthur Pemberton, is appointed as Burgundy's Prime Minister. The council begin <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> government, particularly about the Burgundian treasure.|$|E
5|$|Author Roald Dahl {{disapproved of}} the 1971 film {{adaptation}} and declined the film rights {{to produce the}} sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. Warner Bros. and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment entered <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Dahl estate in 1991, hoping to purchase the rights to produce another film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The purchase was finalized in 1998, with Dahl's widow, Felicity ("Liccy"), and daughter, Lucy, receiving total artistic control and final privilege on the choices of actors, directors and writers. The Dahl Estate's subsequent protection of the source material was the main reason that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory had languished in development hell since the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Blamey was {{involved}} in <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> government over {{the size of the}} Army to be maintained. Now that the danger of invasion of Australia had passed, the government reconsidered how the nation's resources, particularly of manpower, should be distributed. Blamey pressed for a commitment to maintain three AIF divisions, as only they could legally be sent north of the equator where the final campaigns would be fought. He urged that the Empire Air Training Scheme be curtailed, and opposed MacArthur's proposal to use the Australian Army primarily for logistic support and leave combat roles principally to American troops.|$|E

An internal document the newspaper Varden received access to showed that NSB needed to calm down the heated <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> labor unions, and that their negativity to Timetoget was a tactical move to satisfy the labor unions. Minister of Transport, Terje Moe Gustavsen from the Labour Party, stated in a meeting with two parliamentarians from Telemark, that he would allow a new private company, without NSB ownership, to operate the line.|$|E

5|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that Eurotunnel was in <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Intergovernment Commission, which oversees the tunnel, with the aim of amending elements of the safety code governing the tunnel's usage. Most saliently, the requirement that trains be able to split within the tunnel and each part of the train be driven out to opposite ends has been removed. However, the proposal to allow shorter trains was not passed. Eurotunnel Chairman & Chief Executive Jacques Gounon said that he hoped the liberalisation of rules would allow entry into the market of competitors such as Deutsche Bahn. Sources at Eurotunnel suggested that Deutsche Bahn could have entered the market at the timetable change in December 2012. This, however, did not happen.|$|E

5|$|Six {{months after}} the NFLPA {{declared}} itself an independent union, many players were dissatisfied {{with the lack of}} compensation teams provided and voted to strike on July 3, 1968 after official <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> owners stalled. The owners countered by declaring a lockout. By July 14, 1968, the brief work stoppage came to an end. Although a CBA resulted, many players felt that the agreement did not net them as many benefits as they had hoped. The owners agreed to contribute about $1.5 million to the pension fund with minimum salaries of $9,000 for rookies, $10,000 for veterans and $50 per exhibition game; there was at yet no neutral arbitration for disputes.|$|E
