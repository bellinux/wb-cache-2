He also feared that other American interests, including the economy, were suffering through U.S. involvement in the war, and that the U.S. was losing prestige internationally.|$|E

Verlooy and Vandermersh were arrested and imprisoned. Vonck and his remaining supporters forced into exile in Lille where they tried to raise opposition to the Statists but in vain. Faced with an increasingly reactionary government in the United Belgian States, many of the exiled Vonckists felt that they had more to gain from negotiating with Leopold II than with the revolutionaries. Amid rumours of Austrian military forces nearing Belgium, the Statists put their faith in a <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> <b>intervention</b> and began lobbying the Prussians, who were believed to be sympathetic, for support.|$|E

However, the plans to bring the NLF into the mainstream were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E

25|$|At {{this point}} Augustus {{was able to}} use the Tumult of Thorn (Toruń) to his {{political}} advantage. The tumult was a religious disturbance and confrontation involving Catholics and Protestants (Lutherans), followed by a verdict of the state court, which sentenced ten Protestants to death. The affair reflected general deterioration of religious tolerance in the Commonwealth, was widely condemned abroad and only the death of Peter I prevented a <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> <b>intervention</b> prepared in response, with the participation of Frederick William I of Prussia. Augustus refused to intercede on behalf of the condemned and his standing among the unrepentant and unyielding szlachta improved.

[...] Others objected to being reminded of the horrors Kony brought to Uganda. Despite the negative response, the organization still planned on showing the film in other towns, hoping to avoid this response by providing context for the film.

50|$|The word imperialism {{originated}} from the Latin word imperium, which means supreme power. It first became common with its current sense in Great Britain, during the 1870s {{and was used}} with a negative connotation. Previously the word imperialism {{had been used to}} describe to what was pericieved as Napoleon III's attempts of obtaining political support through <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> <b>interventions.</b> The term was and is mainly applied to Western (and Japanese) political and economic dominance, especially in Asia and Africa, in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars. Some writers, such as Edward Said, use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organised with an imperial center and a periphery. This definition encompasses both nominal empires and neocolonialism.|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} drivers of parliamentarisation {{in the domain}} of foreign and {{security}} policy, and <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> <b>interventions</b> more in particular. While supporting the increasing scholarly attention for the drivers of parliamentarisation in this domain, we argue that {{the current state of the}} art remains unsatisfactory when it comes to explaining the executive-side of the puzzle. We suggest that the study of changing executive-legislative dynamics should ideally take into account both sides of the relationship. For doing so, we propose a novel framework that allows for identifying the strategies of both parliamentary and executive actors. We apply this newly proposed framework to the cases of the Belgian participation in the <b>military</b> <b>interventions</b> in Libya (2011) and Iraq (2014 -). The main finding of this article is that stronger parliamentary involvement in the decision about military deployment is not necessarily solely the result of increased parliamentary pressure, but that it also strongly depends on the willingness and strategy of the executive to seek legitimacy or support, particularly in systems characterized by strong party discipline. status: publishe...|$|R

The study does not examine the patterns of reaction to <b>military</b> <b>intervention</b> as such. Instead, {{the focus is on the}} United Nations’ response to the outcome of the <b>military</b> <b>interventions</b> at two main levels. The first is at the level of the Security Council and the decisions taken there on the nature and scope of the involvement of the United Nations in the post-intervention developments in the target state. The second level is the level of the target state and the challenges that the United Nations may face in carrying a given mission. A core dimension addressed in the study is how the United Nations’ responds to demands that it involves itself in situation resulting from actions that it had not authorised beforehand. Another dimension is the question of the legitimacy of the United Nations on the ground in the target state of the intervention. The later is of particular relevance when there is armed resistance to the intervening forces...|$|R
50|$|From an {{evolutionary}} psychology perspective, conflicts regarding {{redistribution of wealth}} {{may have been a}} recurrent issue in the ancestral environment. Humans may therefore have developed psychological mechanisms for judging their chance of succeeding in such conflicts which will affect their political views. For males, physical strength may have been an important factor in deciding the outcome of such conflicts. Therefore, a prediction is that males having high physical strength and low socioeconomic stratum (SES) will support redistribution while males having both high SES and high physical strength will oppose redistribution. Cross-cultural research found this to be the case. For females, their physical strength had no influence on their political views which was as expected since females rarely have physical strength above that of the average male. A study on political attitudes among Hollywood actors found that, while the actors were generally leftist, male actors with great physical strength were more likely to support the Republican stance on foreign issues and <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> <b>interventions.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} {{two-thirds of the}} nineteenth century, Egypt and Paraguay {{experienced}} {{the rapid growth of}} modern industry. Between 1815 and 1850, Egypt developed diversified consumer and producer goods industries, supplied by homemade machinery and equipment. Later on, from 1850 to 1865, Paraguay went through strikingly similar developments, even though these changes were less thorough and prolonged. But this was not a "natural" process brought about by the increasing worldwide division of labor. On the contrary, it signified the substitution of a deliberate economic policy for the "invisible hand" of the international market: Both countries pioneered in producing the general outline of a state plan for modernizing a country with no significant industrial bourgeoisie. For that reason, their eventual failures, following devastating <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> <b>interventions,</b> have given rise to much controversy.

40|$|Is {{capitalism}} contagious? Since WWI, global {{foreign policy}} has treated economic freedom/repression like a virus that spreads between countries. Most recently, the ?domino theory? of freedom has played prominently in U. S. foreign policy toward Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean during the Cold War, and the Middle East during the War on Terror. This paper investigates the spread of economic freedom between nations. Our analysis considers two potential channels of this spread: geography and trade. We estimate two models of spatial dependence using panel data that cover more than 100 countries between 1985 and 2000. We ?nd that capitalism is in fact contagious. Countries consistently ?catch?about 20 percent of their average geographic neighbors?and trading partners?levels and changes in economic freedom. We also explore American <b>foreign</b> <b>military</b> <b>intervention?s</b> ability to spread economic freedom abroad. We ?nd that although intervention may increase freedom in U. S. occupied countries, this freedom is not contagious. Using our estimates of freedom?s spread when it is contagious, we simulate the impact of successful Iraqi occupation on Middle Eastern freedom. Even under the most favorable assumptions, we ?nd that U. S. occupation would minimally improve freedom in this region. ...|$|R

With Soviet financial or military backing, a considerable number of new communist governments succeeded in assuming power during the late 1960s and 1970s.
