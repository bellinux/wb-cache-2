40|$|The recent {{development}} {{in computer science}} that the power demand and required time of code execution can be accurately predicted is paving a path {{that may lead to}} a new paradigm shift in power supply design. Specifically, while the design of power supplies now normally assumes that load current changes at random times and with unknown magnitudes (within a range), future computer loads may communicate with power supplies to provide information that facilitates power management. Such information would include the exact times of occurrence of load transients and their magnitudes. Following this trend of development where the power supply is 'informed' by the load, we propose to use an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>circuit</b> that generates a slowly rising current prior to the occurrence of the actual transient. The slowly rising current can cause the power supply to shift its operation point to a new level slowly without exhibiting output voltage fluctuation.

40|$|Power {{electronics}} converters {{are implemented}} with switching devices that turn {{on and off}} while power is being converted from one form to another. They operate with high switching frequencies {{to reduce the size}} of the converters 2 ̆ 7 inductors, transformers and capacitors. Such high switching frequency operation, however, increases the amount of power that is lost due to switching losses and thus reduces power converter efficiency. Switching losses are caused by the overlap of switch voltage and switch current during a switching transition. If, however, either the voltage across or the current flowing through a switch is zero during a switching transition, then there is no overlap of switch voltage and switch current so in theory, there are no switching losses. Techniques that ensure that this happens are referred to as soft-switching techniques in the power electronics literature and there are two types: zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and zero-current switching (ZCS). For pulse-width modulated (PWM) Dc-Dc converters, both ZVS and ZCS are typically implemented with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>circuits</b> that help the main power switches operate with soft-switching. Although these <b>auxiliary</b> <b>circuits</b> do help improve the efficiency of the converters, they increase their cost. There is, therefore, motivation to try to make these <b>auxiliary</b> <b>circuits</b> as simple and as inexpensive as possible. Three new soft-switching Dc-Dc PWM converters are proposed in this thesis. For each converter, a very simple <b>auxiliary</b> <b>circuit</b> that consists of only a single active switching device and a few passive components is used to reduce the switching losses in the main power switches.

40|$|Modern AC-DC power {{supplies}} utilize {{power factor correction}} {{in order to minimize}} the harmonics in the input current drawn from the utility. The Boost topology is the most popular topology for power factor correction today but it has some disadvantages like very high EMI due to reverse recovery of the boost diode and high switching losses caused by hard switching of the boost switch. Many variations of the original boost topology have been suggested to overcome these problems. The Zero Voltage Transition Boost converter is one such solution. In such a converter an <b>auxiliary</b> resonant <b>circuit</b> is employed which is activated only when the boost switch is turning on or off.
