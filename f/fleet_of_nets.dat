40|$|Estimates of {{potential}} yield for Kainji Lake, {{and the methods}} of analysis by earlier workers are discussed. Also summarized {{is the state of}} the fishery after impoundment, between 1969 and 1971, based on experimental gillnet catches. Recent sampling of the young of the year along the littoral margin indicates that most of the commercially important species have spawned successful 1 y in the lake. An intense fishing mortality of juvenile fish, owing to the use <b>of</b> small mesh <b>nets</b> by local fishermen, presents a possible threat to the future establishment of the fish in the lake. The results of gill-net selection studies based on HOLT'S (1957) method are given. The data have been extracted from experimental gill-net catches with graded <b>fleets</b> <b>of</b> <b>nets</b> between 1969 and 1971. Recommendations based on the above studies have been made to ensure a successful establishment of the fish species in the lake and an increase in catch-per unit effort in subsequent years...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} catch {{performance and}} selectively of gillnets and trammel nets were investigated in 12 sampling stations in Lake Kainji, Nigeria. 3 types <b>of</b> <b>nets</b> with dimensions 50 mx 3 m were constructed using 76 mm and 178 mm meshsizes for two gillnets, 76 mm and 178 mm meshsizes for the lint and ar mour <b>nets</b> <b>of</b> the trammelnets respectively. All the nets were randomly ganged {{together to form}} a <b>fleet</b> <b>of</b> nine <b>nets</b> each, and were set twice in each of the 12 stations which gave a total of 24 fishing operations. A total of 365 fish weighing 88. 9 kg and belonging to 16 different species were caught in all the nets. The trammelnet had the highest catch by number and weight constituting 60...|$|R
40|$|The {{conflicts}} between grey seals and the cod fisheries in the Swedish Baltic Sea have increased steadily {{during the past}} 10 years. In this study we investigated damage to catches caused by seals in the inshore gillnet fishery for cod in the central Baltic Sea. Damage by seals includes both visible catch losses such as fish remains found and hidden losses where fish are removed entirely without leaving any visible fish remains in the net. An observer joined two professional fishermen in two locations, recording the fishing effort and catches on their daily fishing trips {{for a period of}} three months each year in 2005 and 2006. To estimate the hidden losses, marked fish were manually entangled in the nets before resetting. When hauling the <b>nets,</b> the number <b>of</b> marked fish either damaged or lost was used to calculate the “hid-den ” losses. A total <b>of</b> 324 <b>fleets</b> <b>of</b> <b>nets</b> were set and on 169 of these settings, damaged fish were found in the nets when hauled. 59 previously set fleets were selected for experimental trials in which fish were marked and replaced in the nets in order to estimate the extent of the hidden losses, and 39 <b>of</b> these set <b>fleets</b> were found to have been visited by seals.

40|$|The {{food and}} feeding habits of 417 samples of Campylomormyrus {{tamandua}} (Osteichthyes: Mormyridae) in Anambra River, Nigeria were studied from October 2002 to March 2004. Fish {{samples were collected}} monthly at Otuocha and Ogurugu river ports along the Anambra river using a <b>fleet</b> <b>of</b> gill <b>nets</b> <b>of</b> various mesh sizes, traps and hook and lines. Out of the eight (8) categories of food consumed, the most dominant group was benthic invertebrates (IFS = 44. 92) followed by allochthonous invertebrates (IFS = 33. 40) while the least was mud/sand (IFS = 10. 02). Variation in the stomach fullness condition showed that 82 (19. 66 %) of the stomachs studied were empty, 40 (9. 59 %) were full while 295 (70. 74 %) were partially filled. Food richness and diet breadth showed {{no significant difference between}} the seasons and sex respectively (P> 0. 05). The trophic variations and flexibility in C. tamandua are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) and the Baltic gillnet fishery for herring (Clupea harengus) {{during the period}} 2000 - 2005 was investigated, by comparing and contrasting 3 sources of information: data from the European Union (EU) official logbook system, data from a voluntary logbook system and data from field studies. While the EU official logbooks suggest that seal disturbance occurred in 30 % of all herring gillnet fishing events, data from the voluntary logbook gave a figure of 60 %. There was a pronounced seasonal variation {{in the frequency of}} seal-disturbed fishing efforts, with least interference in the early summer, and greatest {{at the end of the}} year. This variation is likely dependent on the life cycle of the seals and their main prey, the herring. Analysis of the EU logbook information also showed that catches were significantly higher on fishing days when there was no seal interference recorded, compared to days when there was such interference. Field experiments demonstrated that herring catches were reduced by 240 kg per <b>fleet</b> <b>of</b> <b>net</b> and fishing occasion when seals were present, which is much more than the observed seals in the area could possibly have consumed, and a very small number of fish remains were found in the nets after seals had been present. These observations suggest that the mere presence of seals does affect catch levels negatively. Nets baited with marked fish were used to estimate hidden losses, i. e. fish removed from the nets, leaving no trace. Seals were assumed to have visited the experimental <b>nets</b> in 14 <b>of</b> the 19 trials. In 11 of these, more than 95 % of the marked fish went missing. The 3 different data sources altogether show that the herring gillnet fishery in the northern Baltic is severely disturbed by interaction with grey seals. </div...|$|R
40|$|A maximum {{likelihood}} {{method of estimating}} gillnet selectivity when the data are obtained by gillnet <b>fleets</b> consisting <b>of</b> several <b>nets</b> <b>of</b> differing mesh size is presented in this paper. The SELECT model is expanded by application of the relative length (i. e. the ratio of fish length to mesh size) to obtain a master curve of gillnet selectivity. Four kinds of functional model, normal, lognormal, skew-normal and bi-normal are fitted to the data. In addition, two cases where the relative fishing intensity is either estimated or fixed by catch effort are compared. The bi-normal model has the lower model deviance {{regardless of whether the}} relative fishing intensity is estimated or not. The estimation of the relative fishing intensity by catch effort is also examined where the estimates of the parameter of the SELECT model are compared with the catch effort as determined by the number <b>of</b> <b>nets</b> <b>of</b> each mesh size used. For the bi-normal model these quantities compare well. Thus, it is concluded that this method gives reliable estimates even if the data for each mesh size is obtained with different catch efforts...|$|R
40|$|Mormyrus rume rume, Hyperopisus bebe bebe, Campylomormyrus {{tamandua}} and Gnathonemus petersii sampled {{from the}} Anambra river with a <b>fleet</b> <b>of</b> gill <b>nets,</b> traps and hook and line were examined for endo-parasitic helminthes from October 2005 to September 2006. Recovered helminthes were Rhadinorhynchus horridus from the intestine of H. bebe bebe and G. petersii;Procamallanus laeviconchus from the stomach of M. rume rume and C. tamandua;Spinitectus mormyri from the stomach of M. rume rume; Contracaecum sp. from the coelom of H. bebe bebe,G. petersii and C. tamandua, whereas an unidentified cestode infected the intestine {{of all the}} mormyrids. G. petersii constitutes a new host record for R. horridus; M. rume rume for S. mormyri and M. rume rume and C. tamandua for P. laeviconchus. In cases of mixed infection the parasites occupied their preferred habitats. The overall prevalence of the endo-parasites in the fish hosts was 41. 9 %, which is within the range (< 50 %) typical of southern Nigerian freshwater lotic habitats. Prevalence, mean intensity and mean abundance of R. horridus in its host fishes {{were higher in the}} dry (October/November-March) than the rainy season (April-September/October); in the nematodes (P. laeviconchus,S. mormyri and Contracaecum) the reverse was the case, whereas no definite pattern was exhibited by the unidentified cestode. P. laeviconchus appeared reddish from engorgement of blood but no damage was evident at the point of attachment. Local inflammation where R. horridus was attached to the mucosa of the intestine was not considered severe. R. horridus and P. laeviconchus are probably the most important parasites of the mormyrids in terms of fishery management in the Anambra river system. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn a novel biomanipulation {{experiment}} salmonids {{were used}} {{as a tool to}} improve water quality. The manipulation was initiated in spring 2000 as a response to non-point sources of phosphorus in a drinking water reservoir in Saxony, Germany. Salmonids (brown trout, Salmo trutta forma lacustris) were chosen as predators as the reservoir has a large hypolimnic water body and surface temperatures rarely exceed 20 °C. The vertical distributions of prey fish and brown trout were analysed with a <b>fleet</b> <b>of</b> vertical gill <b>nets</b> set in the pelagic zone of the reservoir. Consumption of brown trout was estimated by means of a bioenergetic model and the diet analyses of the trout. While the dominant planktivore (roach, Rutilus rutilus) was caught almost exclusively in the epilimnion during the stratification period trout were caught mainly below a depth of 10 m. Diet analysis revealed that the trout performed vertical migrations to consume food in the epilimnic layer, as an important food component were adult terrestrial and aquatic insects. The amount of fish in the food increased strongly with the size of the brown trout. The consumption estimate suggested that the trout had consumed 2 – 3 % of the total roach stock during the study period (May–November 2000) of the first year of biomanipulation. We conclude that in general salmonids are suitable for food-web manipulation in deep reservoirs, but the stocked fish should be as large as possible (> 300 mm) and the proportion of large trout (> 500 mm) should be as high as possible...|$|R
