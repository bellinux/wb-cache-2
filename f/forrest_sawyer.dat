ABC alleged the Foundation was operating at a near 90% administrative cost. ABC alleged that Warwick flew first class and was accommodated at first-class hotels for charity concerts and events in which she participated for the Foundation. Warwick, who had no executive, administrative, or management role in the organization, challenged ABC to investigate the foundation further and alleged that the ABC report was racially motivated.

ABC maintained the report to be factually correct, but the item has not been repeated since the original air date. The foundation was later dissolved.|$|E

Sawyer moved into commercial television with Atlanta's WAGA-TV, a CBS affiliate (currently a Fox owned-and-operated station) from 1980 to 1985. While at WAGA, he shared a Peabody Award in 1982, for Paradise Saved, a documentary on Cumberland Island. Sawyer, Don Smith, and photographer George Gentry were cited for a documentary in which viewers were [...] "treated to a quality of visual beauty not often seen on television and, at the same time, were informed, enlightened, and challenged concerning the problems of retaining a great natural heritage and a diminishing resource—the unspoiled beauty of the Atlantic Coast." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{her book}} Ten Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Went Out Into The Real World (2000), Shriver {{says that she}} became passionate about {{broadcast}} journalism after {{being sent to the}} back of the campaign plane with the press corps while volunteering for her father's 1972 U.S. vice presidential race, calling these orders [...] "the best thing that ever happened to me."

5000|$|With {{a writing}} team in place, Sand would map {{out a plan}} for The Wilton North Report that {{included}} two hosts and segments based on real, as opposed to fictitious, people and situations. The show's centerpiece segment would be its leadoff feature, a daily review of the day's news events (using actual news footage) in a comical and light-hearted yet still hard-hitting tone. Sand called Wilton North [...] "Siskel & Ebert meet The Today Show," [...] and {{wanted it to be}} not only unique but [...] "controversial, opinionated, provocative," [...] not minding if the material would offend people. [...] Sand would also set about searching for hosts for the show, considering not only entertainers but actual journalists for the role; after considering or auditioning various names including comedian Ellen DeGeneres, MTV personality Nina Blackwood, and newscaster <b>Forrest</b> <b>Sawyer,</b> Sand settled on Phil Cowan and Paul Robins, a Sacramento morning drive-time disc jockey team who came in with a limited amount of television experience; Cowan and Robins were hired a mere 10 days before Wilton Norths scheduled debut on November 30, 1987.|$|E

Muir, who had taken over World News Saturday in 2007, took over the Sunday broadcast in 2011, ending the practice of using separate anchors for the Saturday and Sunday editions of the program, with ABC renaming both broadcasts as ABC World News with David Muir as a result. David Muir anchored the weekend program until {{he took over the}} weekday broadcast in September 2014. The program returned to using separate anchors for the weekend broadcasts afterward, with Cecilia Vega being named anchor of the Saturday broadcast and Tom Llamas named anchor of the Sunday edition in February 2015. After Vega was named senior White House correspondent, Llamas was named sole weekend anchor in January 2017, as the practice of using separate anchors for the Saturday and Sunday editions ended once again.|$|E
