50|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} make this intersection safer. A corner refuge island, a setback {{crossing of the}} pedestrians and cyclists, generally between 1.5-7 metres of setback, a <b>forward</b> <b>stop</b> bar, which allows cyclists to stop for a traffic light well ahead of motor traffic who must stop behind the crosswalk. Separate signal staging or at least an advance green for cyclists and pedestrians is used to give cyclists and pedestrians no conflicts or a head start over traffic. The design makes a right turn on red, and sometimes left on red depending on the geometry of the intersection in question, possible in many cases, often without stopping.|$|E

40|$|Reviewed October 1, 1993. "Line {{driving is}} one of the most {{valuable}} techniques for training horses. It can be used to train horses too young to ride, to retrain spoiled horses, or to teach others new movements. Young horses can be taught to move <b>forward,</b> <b>stop,</b> back, stand, turn, and other preliminary obedience steps by line driving. If these maneuvers have been taught on the longe line, so much the better. They can be advanced to sharp turns. Horses also can be introduced to strange objects they might shy from under saddle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. During bipedal gait, a robot {{falls from}} one foot to the other. This mo-tion can be {{approximated}} with that of an inverted pendulum with discrete movements of the contact point. We detail here how to use the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM) for selecting successive contact points in such a way that the centre of mass (COM) of the robot flexibly follows a predefined set of waypoints on a straight or curved trajectory, allowing it to move <b>forward,</b> <b>stop</b> and revert its direction of motion in stable way. The use of a fixed step cycle duration reduces the mathematical complexity and the computational load, ena-bling real-time updating of gait parameters in a microcontroller. ...|$|E
40|$|Backward skating is {{particularly}} an important skill for defenseman positions in ice hockey because defensemen play close to 50 % of the game. Therefore, {{the purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of fatigue in backward skating mechanics so serious injuries can be minimized. Male collegiate ice hockey players participated in the study. Each player skated backward, stop, <b>forward,</b> <b>stop</b> continuously and repeatedly for five times between the two ends of the goal line at their highest intensity. The results showed that the mean minimum hip joint angle was 91. 5 ± 11. 2 ° in the beginning of backward skating trial comparing to the end of backward skating trial of 104. 5 ± 15. 2 ° (p = 0. 051), which is approaching significance. Hence, this study suggests that fatigue may change lower limb kinematics in the backward skating. Future studies are warranted to examine the effects of fatigue on stopping and turning skating mechanics...|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{projectiles}} ejected by discobolocysts in the single-celled Chrysophyceaen alga Ochromonas tuberculatlls travel at speeds of up to 0. 26 km/s, {{as fast as a}} bullet from a low power rifle. They may thus inflict damage to a would-be predator. Their Reynolds number is high [...] around 100, far from the low Reynolds numbers presumed typical of cellular evertts. Hydration of the mucopolysaccharide in discobolocysts, by one to three hydrogen bonds per monomer, is shown to be a sufficient source of energy for this mechanochemical reaction. The hydrogen bonding appears to induce a conformational change, ratherthan swelling of the mucopolysaccharide. It is also {{shown that the}} same degree of hydration of mucopolysaccharides would provide sufficient motive force to explain the gliding motility of rJphid diatoms, when incorporated into the capillarity model for diatom locomotion. The efficiency of the diatom's mechanochemical raphe system may be as high as 99 %. The microfilament bundles adjacent to the raphe inside the cell may control <b>forward,</b> <b>stop</b> and reverse functions by a sliding mechanism...|$|E

5000|$|The M1917 had {{previously}} been used with half-moon clips that held three rounds of the rimless [...]45ACP. If half-moon or moon clips are not used with a rimless cartridge in a revolver, they must be ejected by hand with a rod or field-expedient tool like a pencil. In revolver cylinders not engineered to allow [...]45ACP to headspace properly, as in early production Colt M1917s, the cartridges could slip <b>forward,</b> <b>stopping</b> them from firing. Adding the rim solved both these issues.|$|R

There was no moon and the night was very clear overhead, but, after the afternoon breeze had expired in fitful puffs, the vapours hung thickening over the glancing surface of the Pantai and clung to the shore, hiding from view the middle of the stream.|$|R
