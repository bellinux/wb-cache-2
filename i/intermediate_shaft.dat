Because of this, the engine sported an unusual 90° angle between cylinder banks — a trait shared with the later PRV V6. It was a very compact and innovative design that allowed the use of just one pattern for the cylinder heads and an <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> extended out to drive the auxiliaries.|$|E

40|$|Cyclic {{stick-slip}} friction is {{a well-known}} phenomenon in which the relative motion between two parts involved is intermittent. The relative motion due to external excitation, support compliance of the parts in contact, {{and the difference between}} the static and kinetic friction coefficients contribute to this cyclic stick-slip motion. This paper presents a study on how various vehicle parameters affect the stick-slip vibration in the slider joint between steering <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts.</b> The vibration was simulated using a full vehicle ADAMS model for a maneuver where the vehicle is braking while negotiating a sharp corner. The steering subsystem, which was elaborated in ADAMS/PRE templates for this particular issue, consists of the steering wheel, the steering column, the pinion input shafts, the upper and lower <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts.</b> The cornering and braking event generates the relative velocity and the torque between the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts,</b> which are the most important contributing factors leading to the cyclic friction. The simulation was able to duplicate the stick-slip vibration observed in road tests...|$|R

50|$|A saildrive is a {{transmission}} system for a boat whose inboard engine has a horizontal output shaft. The saildrive's input shaft is therefore also horizontal.

The <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> is then geared so as to drive a horizontal propeller shaft mounted on a skeg outside the hull.|$|E
50|$|Toyota {{introduced}} its Valvematic technology in 2008. Valvematic employs an <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> to achieve continuous variable valve lift. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> has an actuating member for each cylinder. Each actuating member {{is made of}} two finger followers {{on either side of}} a roller bearing member. The followers can rotate in relation to the roller member by means of internal gear threads and an electric motor attached {{to the end of the}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft.</b> The gear threads of the roller member and finger followers are in opposing directions. This means when the shaft swivels, the roller member and finger followers will move in opposing directions, moving either apart or closer together. In this way, the axle angle between them can be varied infinitely by the electric motor. The intake valve is actuated by camshaft via the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft.</b> Specifically, the camshaft acts on the roller member of <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft,</b> transferring the movement to both finger followers, then towards the roller rocker arms and ultimately to the intake valves. When the angle of the finger followers is narrow with respect to the roller member, valve lift is low. As the angle increases, so does valve lift. In this way, Valvematic can vary valve lift by adjusting the angle of the finger followers in relation to the roller bearing member.|$|E

50|$|In {{the shaft}} the {{ventilation}} was natural, being {{due to the}} higher temperature underground than above ground.

50|$|Dr Le Neve Foster {{conducted}} further {{tests with}} mice which proved {{that things were}} much in the same condition; and it then seemed probable that {{the door at the}} 130 fathom level was open, allowing the air going down the main shaft to escape through this level to the succession of <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts</b> which formed the upcast - without going to the lower levels at all. Dr Le Neve Foster was therefore of the opinion that this door should be closed if possible in order that the body of Robert Kelly could be brought up.|$|R
50|$|Where the {{differential}} is not {{located in the}} center line of the vehicle, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> can be fitted to maintain equal length drive shafts on each side. This keeps drive shaft angles equal {{on both sides and}} helps prevent steering irregularities and vibration.The outer end of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> is supported by a bearing secured to the transaxle case and a universal joint assists with alignment.In some cases a longer drive shaft is used on one side.

5000|$|Even {{when the}} driving and driven shafts are at equal angles {{with respect to}} the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft,</b> if these angles are greater than zero, {{oscillating}} moments are applied to the three shafts as they rotate.

40|$|The <b>intermediate</b> {{steering}} <b>shaft</b> is {{very important}} part in the steering system. The steering system {{is a group of}} parts that transmit the movement of the steering wheel to the front and sometimes the rear wheels. The steering system of car is not only important for safety reasons but also to enhance the comfort of car's ride. The most conventional steering arrangement is to turn the front wheels using a hand operated steering wheel which is positioned in front of the driver via the steering column which may contain universal joints and may also be part of the collapsible steering column design to allow it to deviate somewhat from a straight line. In this project modelling of steering shaft is done by using Creo software and for the analysis ansys software is used. From the literature survey it is found that tremendous work is done on the steering system and its optimization but rarely work is done on the <b>intermediate</b> steering <b>shaft</b> or work on it is worth pursuing. So, I have taken this <b>intermediate</b> steering <b>shaft</b> as my M. Tech Project for the development in design or its optimization...|$|R

50|$|A {{configuration}} {{known as}} a double Cardan joint drive shaft partially overcomes the problem of jerky rotation. This configuration uses two U-joints joined by an <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft,</b> with the second U-joint phased {{in relation to the}} first U-joint to cancel the changing angular velocity. In this configuration, the angular velocity of the driven shaft will match that of the driving shaft, provided that both the driving shaft and the driven shaft are at equal angles with respect to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> (but not necessarily in the same plane) and that the two universal joints are 90 degrees out of phase. This assembly is commonly employed in rear wheel drive vehicles, where it is {{known as a}} drive shaft or propeller (prop) shaft.|$|E

50|$|To {{begin with}} the Class XIII H had a boiler with a firebox located above the frame. This was made from three boiler rings, the third one being {{slightly}} conical in shape. The boiler feedwater was supplied through two steam injectors and a Knorr feedwater pump with preheater. The second injector was later omitted. The steam engine was configured as a three-cylinder system with simple steam expansion. Two cylinders were located in the usual horizontal position on the outside, the third cylinder was built between the frame sides at an angle. All three cylinders drove the second coupled axle. The gearing of the inside cylinder was operated from the Heusinger valve gear of the outside cylinders via levers and <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
25|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} began in October 1998 with the {{excavation}} of the Gilman Portal and dewatering work at the two <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts.</b> Tunnel excavation was carried out from November 1999 through July 2001 using a shielded TBM. Construction {{of the tunnel}} included many challenges. The TBM had to bore its way through diverse ground conditions consisting of weak sedimentary rocks; strong, fractured metamorphic rocks; and alluvium, {{all of which were}} below the groundwater table. Special measures such as probing and grouting ahead of the TBM and, in particular, deep dewatering wells, were demonstrated to be effective for controlling adverse ground conditions. The project also showed the advantage of working from a portal. The Gilman Portal site proved to be ideal, supporting very efficient mining and muck disposal operations and also allowing long pipe sections to be installed in the tunnel, significantly reducing the amount of field welding required.|$|R

60|$|The {{shortness}} of the thicker ones at the angles is {{induced by the}} greater depth of the enlarged capitals: thus the 36th shaft is 10 ft. 4-1/3 in. in circumference at its base, and 10 ,, 0-1/2[103] in circumference under the fillet of its capital; {{but it is only}} 6 ,, 1-3/4 high, while the minor <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts,</b> of which the thickest is 7 ,, 8 round at the base, and 7 ,, 4 under capital, are yet on the average 7 ,, 7 high. The angle shaft towards the sea (the 18th) is nearly of the proportions of the 36th, and there are three others, the 15th, 24th, and 26th, which are thicker than the rest, though not so thick as the angle ones. The 24th and 26th have both party walls to bear, and I imagine the 15th must in old time have carried another, reaching across what is now the Sala del Gran Consiglio.|$|R

The Rimutaka Tunnel required an <b>intermediate</b> ventilation <b>shaft.</b> From 1967 diesel locomotives (Da class) replaced electric locomotives (Ew class) on freight trains south of Paekakariki on the Kapiti Line after the track in some older tunnels was lowered, so diesels could run under the catenary into Wellington.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{prognostic}} {{method is}} presented for fault detection in gears and bearings in wind turbine drivetrains. This method {{is based on}} angular velocity measurements from the gearbox input shaft and the output to the generator, using two additional angular velocity sensors on the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shafts</b> inside the gearbox. An angular velocity error function is defined and compared in the faulty and fault-free conditions in frequency domain. Faults can be detected from {{the change in the}} energy level of the frequency spectrum of an error function. The method is demonstrated by detecting bearing faults in three locations: the high-speed shaft stage, the planetary stage and the intermediate-speed shaft stage. Simulations of the faulty and fault-free cases are performed on a gearbox model implemented in multibody dynamic simulation software. The global loads on the gearbox are obtained from a dynamometer test bench and applied to the numerical gearbox model. The method is exemplified using a 750 kW wind turbine gearbox. The case study results show that defects in the high- and intermediate-speed bearings can be detected using this method. It is shown that this procedure is relatively simple, yet accurate enough for early fault detection in wind turbine gearboxes...|$|R

50|$|Double Cardan joints {{are similar}} to double Cardan shafts, except that {{the length of the}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> is {{shortened}} leaving only the yokes; this effectively allows the two Hooke's joints to be mounted back to back. DCJs are typically used in steering columns, as they eliminate the need to correctly phase the universal joints at the ends of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> (IS), which eases packaging of the IS around the other components in the engine bay of the car. They are also used to replace Rzeppa style constant-velocity joints in applications where high articulation angles, or impulsive torque loads are common, such as the driveshafts and halfshafts of rugged four wheel drive vehicles. Double Cardan joints require a centering element that will maintain equal angles between the driven and driving shafts for true constant velocity rotation. This centering device requires additional torque to accelerate the internals of the joint and does generate some additional vibration at higher speeds.|$|E
50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} shafts - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft.</b> This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate shift fork shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear shafts. The shift forks are activated by a cable system. The clutch release bearing is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and release bearing. The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>shaft</b> carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer.
