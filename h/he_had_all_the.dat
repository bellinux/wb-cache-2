25|$|Bhishma was an invincible warrior. He {{was also}} a highly skilled in {{political}} science. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> qualities and abilities for an excellent king. His goodness and sacrifice {{made him one of}} the greatest devotees of Lord Krishna himself. He tried his best to bring reconciliation between the Pandavas and Kauravas to prevent the war. Even in the Kurukshetra war, while he was the general, he tried his best to keep the war low key by minimizing confrontation between the two camps. Even as he fell he tried to use the opportunity to persuade both camps to put an end to the war. Bhishma was a complete human, a complete warrior and a complete teacher (acharya), hence he was known as Bhishmacharya.|$|E

There had been a few plantings of commercial softwood, including a spruce plantation {{on the site of the}} Saxon Deities (largely by John Michael Rysbrack placed 1728-1730). These were felled. Further thinning was carried out, including reopening views between the various buildings and monuments. Replanting of 20,000 trees and shrubs followed, using species present in the original garden. Paths which had become overgrown were re-excavated and eventually covered in gravel from local pits.|$|E

[...] A 2006 World Cup profile suggested he was [...] "much happier on the ball than first impressions may suggest", and could look [...] "ungainly".

500|$|The {{ambulance}} crew {{left the}} hotel at approximately 11:35a.m. to take Hendrix to St Mary Abbot's Hospital and {{they arrived at}} 11:45a.m. Medical registrar Dr. Martin Seifert stated: [...] "Jimi was rushed into the [...] room. He was put on a monitor, but it [...] was flat. I pounded his heart [...] a couple of times, {{but there was no}} point, he was dead". According to Seifert, the attempt to resuscitate Hendrix lasted [...] "just a few minutes". The surgical registrar, Dr. John Bannister, commented: [...] "He was cold and he was blue. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> parameters of someone who had been dead for some time. We worked on him for about half an hour without any response at all." [...] Bannister pronounced Hendrix dead at 12:45p.m., on Friday, September 18, 1970; he was 27 years old. He later stated: [...] "On admission he was obviously dead. He had no pulse, no heartbeat, and the attempt to resuscitate him was merely a formality." ...|$|E
500|$|Following a refit in Portsmouth, Tiptoe {{went to the}} Firth of Clyde {{for working}} up, {{arriving}} on 10 January 1964, when she was ordered not to enter Gareloch due to dense fog. The boat was duly turned around and ran aground on a muddy bank. As the fog cleared it was realised the boat had run aground only [...] opposite that {{of the house of}} the Royal Navy's Captain in Charge for the Clyde area, Captain G. D. Pound. Divers were sent out to assess damage, and after finding none, Tiptoe was refloated on the evening tide and pulled off the shore by two tugboats. The commanding officer at the time was LieutenantCommander David Brazier, who was in his first command. He was later ordered to be severely reprimanded for negligence at a court-martial where he pleaded guilty to the charge. His defence statement read, [...] "The ship was not worked up {{and it was a very}} green company. Unfortunately he ran into fog. He took all the precautions he considered necessary.

500|$|An {{aggressive}} right-handed all-rounder, Loxton {{tended to}} bat in the middle-order, and bowled {{after the new}} ball pacemen. As well as being a belligerent batsman, he was a right-arm fast-medium swing bowler known {{for his ability to}} move the ball, and a powerful outfielder. He had a strong arm and exploited his power frequently, {{to the extent that the}} Australian wicket-keeper Don Tallon complained about the jarring impact of his unnecessarily strong throws when the batsmen were already home and no run out was possible. Loxton was known for his energetic and aggressive approach to cricket, and liked to attack and intimidate opposition batsmen. In one match in the late-1950s, he bowled an eight-ball over at New South Welshman Norm O'Neill consisting entirely of bouncers aimed at the upper body. Loxton was not afraid of opposition bowlers doing the same to him; he had a penchant for trying to hook bouncers out of the ground. He was a predominantly back-foot player whose initial foot-movement tended to be back and towards and then across the stumps. When he committed to a back foot shot, Loxton often made such a decisive retreat that he almost stepped onto his stumps. One painter once captured the Victorian almost disturbing the woodwork with his right leg, leading Loxton to quip [...] "That's what I call using the crease". Hassett said that his fellow Victorian [...] "really used to give everything <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time... Put him on to bowl and he'd bowl his hardest, no matter how he felt." [...] Bradman said that Loxton [...] "never shirked the issue" [...] and that [...] "he’d throw himself into it with everything he had. This is one of the reasons he was a great team man. You could call on him at any stage and he’d give you his very best." [...] Bradman said that the Victorian all-rounder [...] "was never a great cricketer in the sense that some others were great, but he was a very good player and what he lacked in ability he made up for in effort". He further added that the Victorian was [...] "the very essence of belligerence...His whole attitude suggests defiance and when he hits the ball it is the music of a sledgehammer." [...] Former Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, while agreeing that Loxton was always energetic, regarded his bowling as being too dull and predictable to have any major impact at the highest level, and thought that the Victorian all-rounder’s career would have been best served by saving his energy purely for batting.|$|E

It just got so overloaded; it was nuts. So he was smart enough to peel it all back, and he held voices back to the bridge, me at the top end, Carl in the middle and Brian on the bottom. At that point, Brian's right move was to get subtler. He had a very tender track here. 'God Only Knows' is a very small masterpiece with a major heartbeat, and he was right to peel everybody back and wind up with the three parts. In fact, it's probably the only well-known Beach Boys track that has just three voices on it." ...|$|E

Kapler, known as a proponent of advanced statistics and healthy food, explained his flexible general approach, saying: [...] "One thing {{we want to do is}} avoid locking ourselves into any organizational philosophy that can’t be easily altered or improved. While mining for best practices, we have overarching themes and philosophies, but we don’t want to say, ‘This is what we believe’ and get so dug in that we’re not capable of being nimble as new studies present better ways to approach problems and development.

He went around to some forty villages and collected 80,000 taels. A few days ago he went back there and was promptly arrested at the instigation of some Roman Catholics. It appears they had the same sort of scheme, but A. got there first, and when they went around to these same villages to make their collections, they found out that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> money there was. Naturally, they were enraged, so they made complaint against A., and declared that he had been blackmailing the villages....I really think, myself, that A. might have left a little for the Catholics.

[...] Chamberlin indicated that the French and Germans, under pressure from the Americans, released him, insisting that he was never under arrest.|$|E
