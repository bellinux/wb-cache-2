Any revulsion they might feel from fat-ass bastards they ran up against professionally was ad hominem and not ad genus [...] Mary turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>away</b> in revulsion. I felt no revulsion for her maternal fantasies, only a practical concern. She met his advances with revulsion. [...] Pam was driven to revulsion (by {{the sight of the}} dead animal) 〈*The sight of the dead animal drove Pam to revulsion〉. Revulsion at slaughter cut war short [...]|$|E

60|$|Louise turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> regretfully <b>away</b> {{from the}} mysterious spaces. She listened patiently, {{but without any}} sort of emotion, to her maid's flow of distressed words. She even smiled very faintly when the girl had finished.|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{she turned}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>away</b> and {{shut her eyes}} again, and so Rollo withdrew.|$|E

60|$|She turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{slightly}} <b>away,</b> {{as though}} {{interested in the}} passing throng. No flush of color tinged her cheeks. Her straight, firm lips never trembled. He tried to take her hand,--small it was, and encased in old, neatly-mended gloves. She drew it quietly but firmly away. She remained silent.|$|R
60|$|Still {{she gently}} shook <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and looked <b>away.</b> Suddenly {{she turned her}} face toward me. Her blue eyes sparkled, her lips parted, {{and there was a}} flush upon her temples.|$|R
60|$|Prue was mollified at once, {{and after}} {{stirring}} fussily about {{for several minutes}} gave her sister all she asked, and departed to the myriad small cares that made her happiness.

60|$|RAINA (indignantly). I did {{not send}} it to you. (She turns <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>away,</b> and adds, reluctantly.) It was {{in the pocket of}} that coat.|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I don't think I {{would tell}} you if I knew," [...] said Sylvia, turning <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>away.</b> [...] "You see--I don't want you to help caring." ...|$|E

60|$|Her fingers {{went back}} to the frilling, and she turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> sullenly <b>away</b> from me. I had been met in this manner, in the course of plying the good work, {{hundreds}} of times. She merely stimulated me to try again.
