For a product-based organization it is shown that efficiency {{is independent of}} whether the firm or managers are liable for <b>environmental</b> <b>damages.</b> In a functional organization it is optimal either to hold the firm liable for <b>environmental</b> <b>damages</b> or, equivalently, not to hold the production managers liable for <b>environmental</b> <b>damages.</b> We derive conditions to obtain the first-best solution for a given organizational structure.

40|$|In {{providing}} precautionary {{incentives and}} allocating environmental risk, liability for <b>environmental</b> <b>damages</b> faces two difficulties: randomness of damages incurred and nonobservability of precautionary measures.

5|$|In {{advance of}} Winifred's approach, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) issued cyclone watches and {{warnings}} for various locations along the Queensland coast, prompting evacuations in several towns. Damage after landfall was widespread and severe, {{with thousands of}} homes damaged, flooding {{as a result of}} heavy rainfall along major rivers, and severe damage to crops. Debris obstructed roads across northern Queensland and power outages disrupted electrical service, even at water treatment plants, forcing officials to warn residents to boil water as a precautionary measure. Overall, the cyclone caused $86.4million in agriculture-related damages, with sugar cane and banana harvests suffering the most. Tourist operations were generally uninterrupted by the storm, while ecological and <b>environmental</b> <b>damage,</b> if any, was mild. Even so, high winds uprooted trees in wide swaths of forests, with those not completely defoliated. Overall, Winifred caused three deaths and inflicted $130million (1986AUD; $154million USD) in damage.|$|E
40|$|Even in {{period of}} crisis {{development}} projects {{are carried out}} many times as a strategy to boost the economy. Demands for investment in, for instance, transport, energy, health and education come from the need to replace existing infrastructure and for additional infrastructure to support new ways of working and living for an increasing population and to support economic development. New infrastructure development can bring significant economic and social benefits, including the opportunity to build {{in such a way}} as to meet the demographic explosion challenges and to enhance sustainability. However, it can also have significant costs on the environment, related to its construction and use. Such <b>environmental</b> <b>damages</b> can be addressed through the planning and design processes and projects aimed to restore and compensate the lost environmental benefits. According to the Environmental Liability Directive (EDL) for the European Union appropriate measures to compensate the damage should be taken into consideration when deciding how to remedy <b>environmental</b> <b>damages</b> (EU, 2004 / 35 /CE). Different methods exist to assess natural resource injury and execute adequate compensation projects that give back, to the extent possible, the lost environmental services. The present research aims to determine the role of Habitat Banking (HB) as a potential instrument to facilitate the compensation of the <b>environmental</b> <b>damages</b> caused by the infrastructure development. Habitat Banking is an important emerging mechanism for conserving environmental services and biodiversity (Latmier & Hill, 2012; Tietenberg & Lewis, 2009). Furthermore, the HB offers solution to compensate damages where on-site mitigation could be difficult (Environment Bank LTD, 2012) or when the remediation measures may take long time to give back the inured environmental benefits. Thus, the hypothesis of this research is that habitat banking can provide adequate compensation solutions to offset the <b>environmental</b> <b>damages</b> and lost ecosystem services caused by infrastructure development projects, according to the environmental compensation normative enforced. Using the concept of environmental credits, compensation projects and remediation measures, this research proposes to analyse the implementation of habitat banking as an adequate novel instrument to offset <b>environmental</b> <b>damages</b> caused by infrastructure development. The implementation of HB is being studied in selected local case-studies, and the research result will be presented and discussed...|$|R

5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to world markets.

There was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s, resulting in intensive farming and increasing mechanisation. The UK joined the European Economic Community in 1972. Some sectors became viable only with subsidies. A series of reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate <b>environmental</b> <b>damage.</b> A dual farm structure emerged with large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings.|$|E
