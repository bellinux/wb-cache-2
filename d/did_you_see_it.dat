500|$|Filmed in Los Angeles, {{the music}} video reunited Carey with Paul Hunter, {{director}} of the video for her 1997 single, [...] "Honey". Since its release, Carey claimed it {{to be one of}} her favorite videos, due to its complex scenery and fun nature. She explained that she had wanted to work with Hunter again for some time, and was happy to be able to film another music video alongside him. In an interview with MTV News, Carey described her feelings regarding the video, as well as sentiments towards the video's director, Hunter: [...] "But I was so happy to work with him again 'cause ever since 'Honey' I've been trying to relive the splendor of that moment. It's more of just a plain beauty piece with sentimental overtones, but it was great to work with Paul again." [...] Following a tale of love and separation, the video alternates between two different time frames. The first of these involves a tearful Carey in the present, while the second invokes memories of a relationship with a former lover (played by Dolce & Gabbana model Christian Monzon). When questioned regarding a possible relationship with Monzon, Carey said [...] "Erm, how do we play this? OK, he’s a very nice guy, he's been in a fabulous Dolce & Gabbana advert - <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it?</b> And we’ve had some nice conversations and, um, a nice time. OK, I'll say he definitely {{did a very good job}} in the video." [...] Additionally, Carey and Hunter placed several secrets within the video's scenery, that would be intended for the [...] "die-hard fans". Following the video's completion, it premiered on MTV and several other music video channels on November 1, 2005. Aside from the video's script, Carey channeled Marilyn Monroe, one of her icons growing up. During a pool scene, Carey re-enacts a part from Monroe's film Something's Got to Give (1962). In an interview with MTV News, Carey spoke of the re-enactment: ...|$|E

6000|$|The ex-vaquero was {{trembling}} like a child. [...] "Look," [...] he said hoarsely, [...] "look, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see?</b> <b>It</b> is {{the hand of}} God," [...] and fainted on the floor! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh!--Oh!--Oh!" [...] Bert screamed, {{with every}} blow she struck [...] "Hey, old flannel-mouth! Watch out! You'll get yours in a second. Oh! Oh!

6000|$|... "You {{have been}} {{unconscious}} {{for a very}} long time," [...] he said. [...] "Often I used to listen to you talking to yourself. <b>You</b> don't mind, <b>do</b> <b>you?</b> <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> was part of the experiment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What," [...] {{said the}} doctor after a pause, leaning back and sending wreaths of smoke up towards the star-dusted zenith, [...] "what is your idea of your work? I mean, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in {{relation}} to yourself--and things generally?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So much? It {{does not}} look like it. What a very pretty bit of coral I see over there, close to the white rock; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it?</b> It is bright pink. Oh, I would like so much to have it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Have {{you brought}} your hatchet, Miss Brougham? If you have, you're {{just in time}} to join in the {{massacre}} of the innocents.

6000|$|... "The Ghost?" [...] {{repeated}} Mrs. Lecount, clasping {{her hands}} in graceful astonishment. [...] "Dear madam, pardon me! Is {{there such a thing}} in the world?

6000|$|... "' Do you know, Ned, I don't {{believe that}} feller owns {{the whole of}} the boat, 'cause he acts so queer about her, an' I'm almost sorry we spent that money for what we <b>did.</b> <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> belongs to the office, and when I get back an' tell the manager that I had to spend it to get {{something}} to eat, he'll take it out of my wages." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{a little}} ashamed, as it is," [...] Ralph laughed. [...] "We had not {{intended}} {{to come out in}} our new character, so soon; but when my hair was once <b>done,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> was impossible to go about in uniform." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not, aunt? It is {{not easy}} to answer such a {{question}} as that. A woman, I suppose, can't say why she doesn't love a man, nor yet why she <b>does.</b> <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it's</b> so sudden. I hadn't thought of him in that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her face clouded. [...] "We've {{tried to}} cut out that saloon, but <b>it</b> can't be <b>done.</b> <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it's</b> on a {{patented}} claim--the claim was bogus, of course, and we've made complaint, but the matter is hung up, and that gives 'em {{a chance to go}} on." ...|$|R
6000|$|At last I said, [...] "Do you know, Polly, I {{could not}} think {{what you had to}} tell me. I saw you had {{something}} on your mind, that you were anxious and absent, and that your visit had some purpose more than you pretended,--and yet, as you assured me that all I cared for were well, I could not conceive what it could be. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in the paper before Charley started to business?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The people murmured, for the astrologer was old, {{and always}} before had been halting of {{movement}} and at times even lame, but he was nimble enough now and went on with his antics in the liveliest manner. Finally he sprang lightly down and walked away, and passed up the road and {{around the corner and}} disappeared. Then that great, pale, silent, solid crowd drew a deep breath and looked into one another's faces as if they said: [...] "Was it real? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> or was it only I--and was I dreaming?" [...] Then they broke into a low murmur of talking, and fell apart in couples, and moved toward their homes, still talking in that awed way, with faces close together and laying a hand on an arm and making other such gestures as people make when they have been deeply impressed by something.|$|E
5000|$|During {{his time}} on the station, Odo is {{involved}} in an ongoing battle of wits with the Ferengi, Quark. Odo often spends {{a great deal of}} time observing Quark, in humanoid form as well as various other shapes. Over the years the two men would gain a grudging respect for each other. In the series' final episode, [...] "What You Leave Behind", Odo refuses to admit the friendship he had developed with Quark, turning away with his usual contempt. But Quark sees through this, saying, [...] "That man loves me. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it?</b> It was written all over his back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's some {{heart in}} it, too," [...] he growled judiciously. It was a remark of a {{perfectly}} sane seaman. But he added immediately: [...] "It was about time I should come on deck.

2500|$|... t least 8,000 people cross {{our borders}} {{illegally}} every day. Some people {{believe this is}} a security issue, as you know. Some believe it's an economic issue.

6000|$|... "It {{is for me}} not {{to allow}} you to study," [...] replied Forester, [...] "all this forenoon, but to require you to sit still at your desk, with nothing to <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> will be a sort of solitary imprisonment, only your prison will in itself be a {{pleasant}} place." ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{class of}} {{exceptions}} is verbs with the conditional endings -by, -bym, -byśmy, etc. These endings are not counted {{in determining the}} position of the stress; for example, zrobiłbym (I would do) is stressed on the first syllable, and zrobilibyśmy (we would do) on the second. According to prescriptive grammars, the same applies to the first and second person plural past tense endings -śmy, -ście, although this rule is often ignored in colloquial speech (so zrobiliśmy we did is said to be correctly stressed on the second syllable, although in practice it is commonly stressed on the third). These irregular stress patterns are {{explained by the fact that}} these endings are detachable clitics rather than true verbal inflections: for example, instead of kogo zobaczyliście? (whom <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see?)</b> <b>it</b> is possible to say kogoście zobaczyli? - here kogo retains its usual stress (first syllable) in spite of the attachment of the clitic. Reanalysis of the endings as inflections when attached to verbs causes the different colloquial stress patterns.|$|E
5000|$|Immediately after Dupré I see {{a female}} dancer who rushes {{all over the}} stage like a madwoman, making entrechats to right and left in rapid succession, but {{scarcely}} rising, and violently applauded."She is the famous Camargo, my friend, whom you have come to Paris in time to see. She is sixty years old too. She is the first woman dancer who dared to leap, before her they did not, and the wonderful thing is {{that she does not}} wear drawers.""I beg your pardon, I saw.""What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see?</b> <b>It</b> was only her skin, which, to tell the truth, is not white.""La Camargo," [...] I answered penitently, [...] "does not please me; I prefer Dupré."An admirer, a very old man, who was on my left, said that when she was young she did the saut de basque and even the gargouillade and that he had never seen her thighs even though she danced without drawers."But if you never saw her thighs how can you swear that she did not have on drawers?""Oh, that sort of thing is easy to find out. I see that Monsieur is a foreigner.""You are right about that." ...|$|E

It's an homage to her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm a big fan of hers, and I thought it was really pretty at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E

40|$|Now {{each man}} judges well {{the things he}} knows, and of these {{he is a good}} judge. ”-Aristotle, from Nicomachean Ethics It is a cold Friday night, in late November.

Returning from the restroom, wiping your hands {{on the back of your}} jeans to get rid of the last dampness left behind by the air dryer you round the corner and see the striped eleven ball slide neatly into a corner pocket. Your friend Jack is bent over the table with his pool cue extended and the cue ball is rolling away from the direction the eleven ball traveled about half way across the table between Jack and the pocket the ball traveled into. Your other friend, Stan, walks over from the bar with another pitcher of a cheap, domestic brew and asks you what just happened, as he sees Jack grinning ear to ear. You tell Stan that Jack just hit the eleven ball into the corner pocket. Stan asks you how you know this, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> happen? You reply, looking a little oddly at your friend for such an interrogating question, no you didn’t see Jack hit the ball, but you saw the ball go into the pocket, and it looked like Jack was in the position to have hit the ball. Stan says nothing but gives a little nod. Jack having made the first shot now lines up to take his second. As you sip you...|$|E

Tom and I got an overnight pass, and got a room in the Colquitt Hotel, the only half decent one in town, and it looked like the Naomi. We went to the movies Saturday night, saw “My Pal Wolf,” was pretty good, and went again Sunday. That’s all there is to do in this town, it sure is pitiful, you can’t even get beer. Sunday we saw “The Doughgirls,” it was very funny. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it?</b> I’ve got nine hours now, and get my first check tomorrow with my instructor, the instructions give you your checks here because most of our work is solo. What they demand of you here is quite different from basic. Everything is Maximum Performance, getting the most altitude, airspeed or position out of every maneuver that we do. When they saw [sic] glide at 100, they mean 100, not 94 or 101. Everything has to be precise, a margin of 20 feet on altitude is considered poor. We really {{have to be on the}} ball. I get 12 hours of day cross countries, and six of night cross countries, that’s something I never had before, they ought to be fun. I also have a X-C at 18, 000 ’, and one at 200 ! A legal buzz job! In the acrobatics line, we get combat team, where four ships pretend mock battle, two against two, and try to knock each other down, or rather get in position to place a shot. Then on my instrument course I take up radio navigation by beams and Radio Compass, it’s very interesting, and when I graduate I’ll get an instrument rating that will allow me to fly in actual bad weather. I’ll be flying G’s until I graduate, but that’s O. K. with me, a few hours of this type [of] flying proves to you that you’ve got a hell of a lot to learn. We’re still pilots if they make us Co-Pilots or Engineers, we still do plenty of flying. And this Engineer deal doesn’t look too bad, for after the war. You train for six months after graduation, you must learn a lot more than how to pull up wheels or lower flaps, they turn you out an Aeronautical Engineer and it’s a very important job, although I’d rather get pursuit. Well honey, I’ve got to eat now, it’s almost 8 : 30. I love you Mom, and miss you terribly. I’m looking forward so very much to seeing you in March, I’m so glad you can come down, angel. Give my love to Bob 2 ̆ 6 Nan, and all my love to you sweetheart. I love you— Your devoted Son Judd [Transcription ends...|$|E
