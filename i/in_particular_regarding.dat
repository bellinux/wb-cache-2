This marked the best ratings performance of a preview or premiere following a Super Bowl since The Wonder Years in 1988. It was also the largest viewership of the first season, in large part due to its 10:25p.m. time-slot immediately following the Super Bowl. Nevertheless, NBC considered it a disappointing performance, based {{on the amount of}} advertising and press coverage the episode received. [...] The episode received less than half the audience that the Super Bowl itself did. Levinson later said the Super Bowl crowd might not have been perfectly suited to Homicide: Life on the Street. <b>In</b> <b>particular,</b> <b>regarding</b> the episode's complex story lines and distinctive visual style, he said, [...] "I imagine anyone who has been drinking a lot at a Super Bowl party might have trouble following the show." ...|$|E

The issue has arisen <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>regarding</b> Wittgenstein's schooldays, because Adolf Hitler was at the same school for part of the same time.

[...] Other commentators have dismissed as irresponsible and uninformed any suggestion that Wittgenstein's wealth and unusual personality may have fed Hitler's antisemitism, in part because there is no indication that Hitler would have seen Wittgenstein as Jewish.|$|E

2500|$|Van Kampen {{diagrams}} {{are central}} {{objects in the}} small cancellation theory developed by Greendlinger, Lyndon and Schupp in the 1960s-1970s. Small cancellation theory deals with group presentations where the defining relations have [...] "small overlaps" [...] with each other. This condition {{is reflected in the}} geometry of reduced van Kampen diagrams over small cancellation presentations, forcing certain kinds of non-positively curved or negatively cn curved behavior. This behavior yields useful information about algebraic and algorithmic properties of small cancellation groups, <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>regarding</b> the word and the conjugacy problems. Small cancellation theory was one of the key precursors of geometric group theory, that emerged as a distinct mathematical area in the late 1980s and it remains an important part of geometric group theory.|$|E
