When asked whether Kate and Mark's reunion would be bittersweet, McGregor explained [...] "Brennan and Kate definitely have chemistry and their parting was not because they {{had fallen out of}} love. But things are different now and Kate has a new boyfriend. When Brennan tells her he still loves her it's hard because she thought he was dead and had let go of him." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} several months of 1944, Ismay spent almost all of his time {{planning}} for the Normandy Landings. As part of the planning, Ismay personally coordinated the plans for Operation Bodyguard and Operation Fortitude, which were designed to deceive the Germans about the planned Normandy landings. In March, Duncan Sandys, Churchill's nephew, told Ismay that Basil Liddell Hart, a noted strategist and historian, had somehow discovered the secret plans for the Normandy landings. This development {{had the potential to}} compromise the entire operation, so Ismay personally interviewed Liddell Hart, who claimed to have simply [...] "worked <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> for himself" [...] without any access to secret information. After their interview, Ismay directed the matter to the MI5, who never found evidence of wrongdoing, although it is suspected that Liddell Hart may in fact have received information from military planners.|$|E
500|$|Libra Scale was {{released}} on November 22, 2010. It received critical acclaim from music critics, but was a commercial disappointment, debuting at number nine on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling less than all of his previous three studio albums. Ne-Yo stated: [...] "The album is based upon this short story which basically follows these three characters who are {{forced to choose between}} money-power-and-fame versus love. Which in turn is why I've called it 'Libra Scale'. You know, its whole concept is based on that question of morality – that, if you weighed <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> on a libra scale, which one of those two options would you choose?". Libra Scale sold 112,000 copies in its first week. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 11 on the UK Albums Chart, while debuting at number one on the UK R Chart.|$|E
500|$|According to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Sparrow is a trickster {{who uses}} wit and deceit to attain his goals, preferring to end {{disputes}} verbally instead of by force. He walks {{with a slightly}} drunken swagger and has slurred speech and flailing hand gestures. Sparrow is shrewd, calculating, and eccentric. He fools Norrington and his crew to set sail on the royal ship Interceptor, which compels the admiration of Lieutenant Groves as he concedes: [...] "That's {{got to be the}} best pirate I have ever seen". Norrington himself acquiesces to this praise: [...] "So it would seem", in sharp contrast to what he had previously proclaimed: [...] "You are without doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of". In the third film, while he leaves Beckett's ship stranded and makes off, Lieutenant Groves asks him: [...] "Do you think he plans <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>out,</b> or just makes it up as he goes along?" ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} after his return, Shackleton {{engaged in a}} strenuous schedule of public appearances, lectures and social engagements. He then sought {{to cash in on}} his celebrity by making a fortune in the business world. Among the ventures which he hoped to promote were a tobacco company, a scheme for selling to collectors postage stamps overprinted [...] "King Edward VII Land" [...] (based on Shackleton's appointment as Antarctic postmaster by the New Zealand authorities), {{and the development of a}} Hungarian mining concession he had acquired near the city of Nagybanya, now part of Romania. None of these enterprises prospered, and his main source of income was his earnings from lecture tours. He still harboured thoughts of returning south, even though in September 1910, having recently moved with his family to Sheringham in Norfolk, he wrote to Emily: [...] "I am never again going South and I have thought <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> and my place is at home now". He had been in discussions with Douglas Mawson about a scientific expedition to the Antarctic coast between Cape Adare and Gaussberg, and had written to the RGS about this in February 1910.|$|E
500|$|Simone {{was known}} for her temper and {{frequent}} outbursts. In 1985, she fired a gun at a record company executive, whom she accused of stealing royalties. Simone said she [...] "tried to kill him" [...] but [...] "missed". In 1995, she shot and wounded her neighbor's son with an air gun after the boy's laughter disturbed her concentration. According to a biographer, Simone took medication for a condition from the mid-1960s on. All this was only known to {{a small group of}} intimates, and kept out of public view for many years, until the biography Break Down and Let <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>Out</b> written by Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan revealed this in 2004, after her death. [...] Singer-songwriter Janis Ian, a one-time friend of Simone's, related in her own autobiography, Society's Child: My Autobiography, two instances to illustrate Simone's volatility: one incident in which she forced a shoe store cashier, at gunpoint, to take back a pair of sandals she'd already worn; and another in which Simone demanded a royalty payment from Ian herself as an exchange for having recorded one of Ian's songs, and then ripped a pay telephone out of its wall when she was refused.|$|E
500|$|The Byrds {{included}} {{a recording of}} [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] on their 1965 debut album, Mr. Tambourine Man. The song was the last track to be recorded for the album but the session was marred by conflict and drama. After the band had completed the song's instrumental backing track, guitarist and harmony vocalist David Crosby announced that he wasn't going to sing on the recording and was instead leaving the studio for the day. The precise reason for Crosby's refusal to sing the song has never been adequately explained but the ensuing fracas between the guitarist and the band's manager, record producer Jim Dickson, ended with Dickson sitting on Crosby's chest, telling him [...] "The only way you're {{going to get through}} that door is over my dead body...You're going to stay in this room until you do the vocal." [...] According to a number of people present in the studio that day, Crosby burst into tears but eventually completed the song's harmony part with sterling results. Dickson himself noted in later years that his altercation with Crosby was a cathartic moment in which the singer [...] "got <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> and sang like an angel." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode is}} a parody on the {{disaster}} film genre, {{which has been}} parodied in previous South Park episodes, like [...] "Pandemic", the twelfth season parody of the film Cloverfield. [...] "Pee" [...] included a particularly large number of references to 2012, a science fiction film {{about the end of}} the world as predicted by the Mayan calendar, which was released only days before [...] "Pee" [...] was originally broadcast. The episode parodies many common elements of such disaster films, including scientists struggling to figure out the source of the problem. The destruction of rides and park amenities by the tsunami of urine is a reference to the destruction of historical monuments in 2012, and other such disaster films by Roland Emmerich, the director of, White House Down, 2012, Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow. [...] "Pee" [...] also includes several references to the 2012 phenomenon, the prediction that cataclysmic events would occur in the year 2012, which is said to be the end of the Mayan Long Count calendar. The scene in which Kyle is forced to drink three cups of urine in order to prevent his body from enduring the effects of fluid pressure before swimming down to drain <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>out,</b> is a parody of a scene in the 1989 film The Abyss, where the protagonist inhales a liquid breathing medium before venturing into the ocean depths.|$|E
500|$|Mardas {{gave the}} Beatles regular reports of his progress, {{but when they}} {{required}} their new studio in January 1969, during the Get Back project that became Let It Be, they discovered an unusable studio: no 72-track tape deck (Mardas had reduced it to 16 tracks), no soundproofing, no talkback (intercom) system, and not even a patch bay to run the wiring between the control room and the 16 speakers that Mardas had fixed haphazardly to the walls. The only new piece of sound equipment present was a crude mixing console which Mardas had built, which looked (in the words of Martin's assistant, Dave Harries) like [...] "bits of wood and an old oscilloscope". The console was scrapped after just one session. Harrison said it was [...] "chaos", {{and that they had}} to [...] "rip <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> and start again," [...] calling it [...] "the biggest disaster of all time." [...] Harrison's suspicions of Mardas' competence had been raised when he saw him wandering around in a white coat with a clipboard, and considered the possibility that Mardas had [...] "just read the latest version of Science Weekly, and used its ideas". Mardas later stated that he had never been in the basement of Savile Row, as the studio equipment he was building was being tested in Apple Electronics, at Boston Place, Marylebone.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his initial}} meeting with President Bush {{regarding}} the surge, Keane said {{he made a}} phone call to Newt Gingrich to ask his advice prior to the meeting. As Keane said in 2014, Gingrich gave me some good advice. He said, [...] "Look, Jack. Most people go in the Oval Office, even people who go in there a lot, have a tendency in front of the President of the United States to always leave something on the table." [...] He said, [...] "Don’t leave anything on the table." [...] He said, [...] "You’re going to get about 15 minutes at best and put <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> there. And when you walk out of that room, feel good that you got <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> there." [...] So that was sound advice, and I did put <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> there.|$|E

2500|$|On October 14, 2012, Miller {{announced}} that his second album, Watching Movies with the Sound Off, {{would be released}} in early 2013.
