500|$|Herc {{carefully}} {{studied the}} dancers. [...] "I was smoking cigarettes and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> for the records to finish. And I noticed people {{was waiting for}} {{certain parts of the}} record," [...] he says. It was an insight as profound as Ruddy Redwood's dub discovery. The moment when the dancers really got wild was in a song's short instrumental break, when the band would drop out and the rhythm section would get elemental. Forget melody, chorus, songs—it was all about the groove, building it, keeping it going. Like a string theorist, Herc zeroed in on the fundamental vibrating loop {{at the heart of the}} record, the break.|$|E
500|$|Yankovic {{waited for}} almost two years for the next [...] "big thing" [...] to emerge. [...] "I don't have any really good reason why it took so long {{other than the fact that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> for Michael Jackson's new album to come out," [...] Yankovic explained. Unfortunately for Yankovic, the new album hit several snags. On November 26, 1991, Michael Jackson's new album, Dangerous was released. After hearing the hit single [...] "Black or White," [...] Yankovic {{approached}} Jackson about a potential parody entitled [...] "Snack All Night." [...] Although Jackson was a big supporter of Yankovic's work, he felt that a parody might damage the song's message. Jackson told Yankovic that he could, if he wanted to, parody another song off his album, but just not [...] "Black or White".|$|E
500|$|Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune {{believed}} Nolan and Goyer {{managed to}} [...] "comfortably mix the tormented drama and revenge motifs with light hearted gags and comic book allusions," [...] and that Nolan takes the series {{out of the}} [...] "slam-bang Hollywood jokefests" [...] the franchise had drifted into. Comic book scribe and editor Dennis O'Neil stated that he [...] "felt the filmmakers really understood the character they were translating", citing this film as {{the best of the}} live-action Batman films. In contrast, J.R. Jones, from the Chicago Reader, criticized the script, and Nolan and David Goyer for not living up to the [...] "hype about exploring Batman's damaged psyche". Roger Ebert, who gave mixed reviews to the previous films, and claimed in his review for Batman Returns that he did not believe noir worked in superhero films, wrote this was [...] "the Batman movie I've been waiting for; more correctly, this is the movie I did not realize <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> for". Giving it four out of four stars, he commended the realistic portrayals of the Batman arsenal – the Batsuit, Batcave, Tumbler, and the Batsignal – as well as the focus on [...] "the story and character" [...] with less stress on [...] "high-tech action".|$|E

[...] "We talked about having a family, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> for her to grow up," [...] he says. She left him in 1976 for Glen Campbell and had one child (Dillon) with Campbell, whom she also left shortly after Dillon's birth. [...] "Obviously, I was right," [...] Davis once stated.|$|E

When asked about the {{significance}} of the match, he described a moment of confusion outside the change-rooms. [...] "Funnily enough <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> downstairs and I needed the change room locker to be opened for us and I was just waiting and the Queensland Cricket lady came down," [...] Khawaja said at the Gabba. [...] "She was like 'Oh, you need the locker rooms open?' I went 'yes please' and she started walking to the Pakistani change room. I was like, 'No, I'm that way, thank you'.|$|E

A few months after their split, he was engaged to someone else. [...] "We were so intense I thought we would get married. But that was something he never wanted... So when I found out he does want that with someone else, it was just the horrible-est feeling ever. But after I wrote it, I felt more at peace. It set me free... I didn't think it would resonate... with the world! I'm never gonna write a song like that again. I think that's the song I'll be known for." [...] She also said that [...] "I wrote that song on the end of my bed. I had a cold. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> for my bath to run. I'd found out that he'd got engaged to someone else." ...|$|E

2500|$|All of {{a sudden}} we had two Australian teams on one tour... I {{certainly}} felt excluded... At one stage in England <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> in a bar for my teammates to come downstairs, but because everyone was up the street with Packer, they never came... I was certainly disappointed to be left out. At that stage I think I had played nine Tests and was averaging 40 and you had other people who were barely Shield cricketers being called up by Packer. I didn't know the reasons why those guys were in it and I wasn't. That is always a question I will wonder about. I certainly kept being mates with Hookesy... It was a strange feeling. There were times when we were there to play for Australia and some blokes were off at a meeting about something else. There were times when there were arguments in the bar that got a lot louder than what they should have been.|$|E
2500|$|Shimojo {{commented that}} the balance {{checking}} basically went on until someone said [...] "Stop it, stop it, {{we really have to}} launch it now". He attributes this work to why Advance Wars is so highly revered. In designing maps, he comments {{that it is impossible to}} please everyone, explaining that some people prefer maps where they start out weak and grow stronger, while others prefer to start out strong and tear through their opponent. His goal was to ensure that there were enough maps that people could say [...] "Here we go, here’s one of my maps. This is what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> for". The mechanic of unlocking maps was introduced into the game as a means of getting gamers to play the game for longer. However, in an interview discussing why the feature was removed in the future title , a developer commented that it prevented people who were too busy to spend the time unlocking levels, and that there were better ways to keep players interested.|$|E
2500|$|The Chase-Opening race at Chicagoland Speedway {{started with}} {{qualifying}} being rained-out and Kyle Busch starting on Pole {{for being the}} fastest in first practice, and Chase Seed #1 Brad Keselowski wound up starting 25th for the 267 lap event. Busch led 46 laps early on, but the race saw comers and goers as it saw only a few cautions for the first 3/4 of the event. Jeff Gordon, Jamie McMurray, Keselowski, and Kevin Harvick (who led a race-high 79 laps) took turns at the front {{over the course of}} 100 laps of green. Keselowski and Harvick both suffered loose wheels and had to start at the tail-end of the lead lap. Chase driver Aric Almirola was leading on series of green flag pit stops with 30 to go when his engine blew and was forced to retire. Rookie Kyle Larson wound up taking the lead in the late going with a superior machine, battling Harvick, Gordon, and Keselowski in the late going with Keselowski making a three-wide move in between Larson and Harvick, taking the lead for good. With less than 10 laps to go, the final caution came out after Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. and Danica Patrick got together in Turn 4. On the final restart, Keselowski got away easy, Harvick fell to 5th, and Keselowski the #1 seed scored his 5th win of the season and second at Chicagoland. Gordon beat Larson for 2nd, and Joey Logano blew up out of Turn 4, but streaked across the finish line up in smoke to finish 4th. “I don’t really know what happened," [...] Keselowski said. [...] "I just know we got to the lead. I saw Kyle and Kevin racing each other really hard, they were aggressively side drafting and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> for an opportunity to strike and it came. The car stuck and everything came together." ...|$|E

2500|$|Resistance when {{it first}} began {{in the summer of}} 1940 was based upon what the writer Jean Cassou called refus absurde ("absurd refusal") of refusing to accept that the Reich would win and even if it did, it was better to resist. Many résistants often spoke of some [...] "climax" [...] when they saw some {{intolerable}} act of injustice, after which they could not longer remain passive. The résistant Joseph Barthelet told the British SOE agent George Miller that his [...] "climax" [...] occurred when he saw the German military police march into the Feldgendarmerie in Metz a group of Frenchmen, one of whom was a friend. Barthelt recalled: [...] "I recognized him only by his hat. Only by his hat, I tell you and because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> on the roadside to see him pass. I saw his face all right, but there was no skin on it, and he could not see me. Both his poor eyes had been closed into two purple and yellow bruises". The right-wing résistant Henri Frenay who had initially sympathized with the Révolution nationale stated that when he saw the German soldiers in Paris in the summer of 1940, he knew he had do to something to uphold French honor because of the look of contempt he saw on the faces of the Germans when viewing the French. In the beginning, resistance was limited to activities such as severing phone lines, vandalizing posters and slashing tyres on German vehicles. Another form of resistance was underground newspapers like Musée de l'Homme (Museum of Mankind) which circulated clandestinely. The Musée de l'Homme was founded by two professors, Paul Rivet and the Russian émigré Boris Vildé in July 1940. In the same month, July 1940 Jean Cassou founded a resistance group in Paris while the liberal Catholic law professor François de Menthon founded the group Liberté in Lyon.|$|E
