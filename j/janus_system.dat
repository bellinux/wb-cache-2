40|$|INTRODUCTION Speech-to-speech {{translation}} {{has made}} significant advancesover the past decade, with several high-visibility projects (C-STAR, Verbmobil, the Spoken Language Translator, and others) significantly advancing the state-of-the-art. While speech recognition can currently effectively deal with very large vocabularies and is fairly speaker independent, speech translation is currently still effective only in limited, albeit large, domains. The issue of domain portability is thus of significant importance, with several current research efforts designed to develop speech-translation systems that can be ported to new domains with significantly less time and effort than is currently possible.

The study of the Jupiter system and the possible existence of habitable environments offer the best opportunity for understanding the origins and formation of the gas giants and their satellite systems. The JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) camera <b>system</b> <b>JANUS</b> (Jovis, Amorum ac Natorum Undique Scrutator) will determine the formation and characteristics of magmatic, tectonic, and impact features, relate them to surface forming processes, constrain global and regional surface ages, and investigate the processes of erosion and deposition. Global medium resolution imaging of Ganymede and important parts of the surface of Callisto better than 400 m/pixel (resolution limited by mission data volume) will provide context information. Selected targets will be investigated with high-resolution imaging with spatial resolution from 25 m/pixel down to 2. 4 m/pixel. The camera system has 13 panchromatic, broad- and narrow-band filters in the 0. 36 μm to 1. 1 μm range, and provides stereo imaging capabilities. JANUS will also allow relating spectral, laser and radar measurements to geomorphology and thus will provide the overall geological context. The Europa flybys will enable high-resolution observations of selected high priority targets of young and potentially active areas. Monitoring of Jupiter’s atmosphere, Io’s volcanic activity, the ring system and small moons will complete the Jovian <b>system</b> exploration. <b>JANUS</b> is designed to meet all scientific requirements foreseen by JUICE Sci-RD for both NAC and WAC.

The analysis is based on a higher order intansional logic described in detail in Hinrichs, Ayuso and Scha (1987). Temporal expressions of English are translated into this language as quantifiere over times which bind temporal indices on predicates. The semantic evaluation of time-dependent predicates is defined relative to a set of discourse contexts, which, following Reichenbach (1947), include the parameters of speech time and reference time. The resulting context-dependent and multi-indexed interpretation of temporal expressions solves a set of well-known problems that arise when traditional systems of tense logic are applied to natural language semantics. Based on the principle of rule-to-rule translation, the compositional nature of the analysis provides a straightforward and welldefined interface between the parsing component and the semantic interpretation component of JANUS...|$|E

The prospect of such potential applications, along with the fact that systems with many motors or active elements display interesting cooperative phenomena of fundamental interest, has made the study of synthetic motors an active research area. Janus motors, comprising catalytic and noncatalytic hemispheres, figure prominently in experimental and theoretical studies of these systems.

The analysis of microscopic models from first principles provides a foundation from which the range of validity and limitations of approximate theories of the dynamics may be assessed.

Convivial systems {{have the potential to}} break down the counterproductive barrier between programming and using programs. Knowledge-based design environments are prototypes for convivial systems. These environments support human problem-domain communication, letting users to work within their domains of expenise. One of the design rationales behind design environments is to ease the construction and modification of artifacts designed within the environment. But because design environments are intentionally not general purpose programming environments, situations will arise that require modifications to the design environment itself. The rationale and the techniques for these later modifications are discussed in this paper. Our conceptual framework for end-user modifiability is illustrated in the context of JANUS, an environment for architectural design.
