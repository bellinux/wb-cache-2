40|$|The {{incidence}} of head injury in South Australia was estimated from <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> (discharges, transfers and deaths) data for 1980 and 1981. The rate of <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> {{of patients with}} head injury in these years was high by international standards, and was 33 % greater for country residents than for residents of the Adelaide metropolitan area. Marked differences in separation rates were observed between different age, sex and occupational groups. On the basis of indirect measures of injury severity, the injury severity threshold for admission to hospital with head injury appeared to be similar in country and city hospitals.

40|$|Road crashes {{result in}} {{substantial}} trauma and costs to societies around the world. Robust costing methods {{are an important}} tool to estimate costs associated with road trauma, and are key inputs into policy development and cost-benefit analysis for road safety programmes and infrastructure projects. With an expanding focus on seriously injured road crash casualties, {{in addition to the}} long standing focus on fatalities, methods for costing seriously injured casualties are becoming increasingly important. Some road safety agencies are defining a seriously injured casualty as an individual that was admitted to hospital following a road crash, and as a result, <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> data provide substantial potential for estimating the costs associated with seriously injured road crash casualties. The aim {{of this study is to}} establish techniques for estimating the human recovery costs of (non-fatal) seriously injured road crash casualties directly from <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> data. An individuals' road crash-related hospitalisation record and their personal injury insurance claim were linked for road crashes that occurred in New South Wales, Australia.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate variation in rates of <b>hospital</b> <b>separations</b> for diabetes related foot disease and the relationship with levels of social advantage and disadvantage. Methods Using the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (IRSD) each local government area (LGA) across Victoria was ranked from most to least disadvantaged. Those LGAs ranked at the lowest end of the scale and therefore at greater disadvantage (Group D) were compared with those at the highest end of the scale (Group A), in terms of total and per capita <b>hospital</b> <b>separations</b> for peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, foot ulceration, cellulitis and osteomyelitis and amputation. <b>Hospital</b> <b>separations</b> data were compiled from the Victorian Admitted Episodes Database. Results Total and per capita separations were 2, 268 (75. 3 / 1, 000 with diabetes) and 2, 734 (62. 3 / 1, 000 with diabetes) for Group D and Group A respectively. Most notable variation was for foot ulceration (Group D, 18. 1 / 1, 000 versus Group A, 12. 7 / 1, 000, rate ratio 1. 4, 95 % CI 1. 3, 1. 6) and below knee amputation (Group D 7. 4 / 1, 000 versus Group A 4. 1 / 1, 000, rate ratio 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 5, 2. 2). Males recorded a greater overall number of <b>hospital</b> <b>separations</b> across both socioeconomic strata with 66. 2 % of all separations for Group D and 81. 0 % of all separations for Group A recorded by males.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the safety and security of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The safety of children is intrinsically related to the security of their families and communities and the accessibility of appropriate support systems. National data show that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, compared with their non-Indigenous counterparts, are over- represented in various aspects of child safety. In particular, Indigenous children have higher rates of hospitalisations due to injury, higher rates of injury mortality and more frequently come into contact with child protection and juvenile justice systems. Injury and violence The injury <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> rate among Indigenous children was 1. 3 times the rate for non-Indigenous children in 2007 – 08. The leading causes of injury <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> for Indigenous children were the same as for non-Indigenous children, although the rates of each were consistently higher for Indigenous children. In particular, the <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> rate for assault for Indigenous children was over 5 times the rate for non-Indigenous children. In 2003 – 2007, one-quarter of all deaths among Indigenous children aged 0 – 17 years were due to external causes of injury. The death rate due to external causes of injury for Indigenous children was almost 3 times the rate for non-Indigenous children. Child abuse and neglect During 2009 – 10, Indigenous children were: nearly 8 times as likely as non-Indigenous children to be the subject of substantiated child abuse or neglect around 9 times as likely to be on a child protection care and protection order almost 10 times as likely to be living in out-of-home care most likely to experience neglect in substantiated cases; for non-Indigenous children emotional abuse was most common. Juvenile justice On an average day Indigenous young people were 15 times as likely to be under juvenile justice supervision as non-Indigenous young people. This over-representation was even higher for those in detention—Indigenous young people were 24 times as likely to be detained as non-Indigenous young people. Indigenous young people tend to enter their first period of juvenile justice supervision at a younger age than non-Indigenous young people. Indigenous young people spent on average 5 days longer than non-Indigenous young people in unsentenced detention. Image: Rusty Stewart / flick...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Asthma {{remains a}} {{leading cause of}} illness, where primary care can assist to reduce hospitalisations through prevention, {{controlling}} acute episodes, and overall management of asthma. In Victoria, Asthma hospitalisations were as high as 3. 1 hospitalisations per 1000 population in 1993 – 94. The primary aims of this study are to: determine if changes in asthma hospitalisations have occurred between 2010 and 2015; determine the key factors that impact asthma hospitalisation over time; and verify whether rural and urban asthma hospitalisations are disparate. A secondary aim of the study is to compare 2010 – 2015 results with asthma data prior to 2010. Methods <b>Hospital</b> <b>separation</b> data from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2015 were obtained through the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset and other agencies. Data included sex, age, Local Government Area, private or public patient, length of stay, and type of discharge. Asthma and predictor variables were analysed according to <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> rates after adjusting for smoking and sex. Hierarchical multiple regression examined the association between asthma and predictor variables. Results During the study period, 49, 529 asthma hospital separations occurred, of which 77. 5 % were in metropolitan hospitals, 55. 4 % hospital separations were aged 0 – 14  years, and 21. 7 % were privately funded. State-wide hospital separations were 1. 85 per 1000 population and were consistently higher in metropolitan compared to rural areas (1. 93 vs 1. 64 per 1000 population). When data among metropolitan adults aged 15 and over were analysed, an increase in the proportion of smokers in the population was reflected by {{an increase in the number}} of hospital separations (Adj OR 1. 035). Further, among rural and metropolitan children aged 0 – 14 the only predictor of asthma hospital separations was sex, where metropolitan male children had higher odds of separation than metropolitan females of the same age (Adj OR 4. 297). There was no statistically meaningful difference for separation rates between males and females in rural areas. Conclusions We demonstrated a higher overall <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> rate in metropolitan Victoria. For children in metropolitan areas, males were hospitalised at higher rates than females, while the inverse was demonstrated for children residing in rural areas. Therefore, optimising asthma management requires consideration of the patient’s age, gender and residential context.

40|$|Background: Mortality {{associated}} with dialysis and transplantation is well characterized. Less well described are <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> rates for “non-renal” diagnoses among people receiving kidney replacement therapy (KRT = haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation). We examined these rates among Australians receiving KRT. Methods: Observational study based on Australian National Hospital Morbidity Database, incorporating Australian {{public and private}} hospitals. Separations from this dataset were examined for 2002 – 7, excluding day-only haemodialysis. ICD (International Classification of Disease) codes were used to identify separations for people receiving chronic KRT. Separations categorized into “renal” and “non-renal” by principal diagnosis. Separation rate, admission length and in-hospital mortality were compared with the general population. Results: Overall <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> rate (adjusted for age and gender) was increased relative {{to the general population}} for all groups: for HD patients, relative rate (RR) was 4. 49 [95 % confidence interval 4. 460 – 4. 53]; for PD patients 5. 52 [5. 460 – 5. 59]; for transplant recipients 4. 83 [4. 20 – 4. 28] (all p < 0. 001). When restricted to separations with a “non-renal” principal diagnosis, the excess remained among KRT groups: HD adjusted RR 2. 20 [2. 170 – 2. 22], PD 2. 00 [1. 950 – 2. 04] and transplants 2. 63 [2. 600 – 2. 66], all p < 0. 001). The length and in-hospital mortality for separations in each KRT group was also increased. By ICD- 10 chapter, rates of separations with infectious and metabolic causes were increased in all KRT groups; separations with circulatory and respiratory causes were also increased. Conclusion: Among people receiving KRT in Australia, there is a substantial burden of morbidity in addition to that directly related to KRT.

40|$|Background: There is a {{need for}} routine {{estimates}} of injury recovery costs from pedestrian collisions using <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> records for economic evaluations. Objective: To estimate the cost of injury recovery following pedestrian–vehicle collisions using the personal injury recover cost (PIRC) equation using key demographic and injury characteristics. Method: An estimation of the costs of on-road pedestrian–vehicle collisions involving individuals who were injured and hospitalized in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, from 2002 to 2011 using the PIRC equation. The PIRC estimates individual injury recovery costs and does not include costs associated with property damage, vehicle repair, or rescue services. Individual recovery costs associated with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) were estimated. The injured individual's mean, median, and total injury recovery costs are described for key demographic, injury, and crash characteristics. Results: There were 9, 781 pedestrians who were injured, costing an estimated total of $ 2. 4 billion in personal injury recovery costs, an annual cost of $ 243 million. Males had a total injury recovery cost 1. 7 times higher than females. The median injury recovery cost decreased with increasing age. TBI ($ 248, 491) and spinal cord and vertebral column injuries ($ 264, 103) had the highest median injury recovery costs for the body region of the most severe injury. TBI accounted for 22. 6 % of the total injury recovery costs for the most severe injury sustained. Just over one third of pedestrians sustained 4 or more injuries, with a median cost of $ 243, 992, which was 1. 6 times higher than the cost for a pedestrian who sustained a single injury ($ 153, 682). Conclusions: Personal injury recovery costs following pedestrian–vehicle collisions where a pedestrian is injured are substantial in NSW. The PIRC equation enables the economic cost burden of road traffic injury to be calculated using <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> data.

40|$|Background: Research into nursing-sensitive {{outcomes}} using administrative health {{data has}} focussed on hospitalised adults. However, we developed algorithms for {{the identification of}} 13 paediatric nursing-sensitive outcomes, which we seek to examine for clinical utility. The aims were to determine the rates of paediatric nursing-sensitive outcomes in a Western Australian hospital and ascertain sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with {{a greater risk of}} developing nursing-sensitive outcomes in hospitalised children. Method: A retrospective cohort study used linked administrative data of all Western Australian children ≤ 18 years admitted to the only tertiary paediatric hospital in Perth between 1999 and 2009. Rates per 1, 000 <b>hospital</b> <b>separations</b> and per 10, 000 patient days were calculated for the following nursing-sensitive outcomes: lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), gastrointestinal (GI) infection, pneumonia, sepsis, arrest/shock/respiratory failure, central nervous system complication, central venous line infection, infectious disease, pressure ulcer, failure to rescue, surgical wound infection, physiologic/metabolic derangement, and postoperative cardiopulmonary complications. Poisson multiple regression models were fitted to estimate rate ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for suspected risk factors. Results: Linked records of 129, 719 <b>hospital</b> <b>separations</b> were analysed. Rates ranged from 0. 5 / 1, 000 for pressure ulcer to 14. 0 / 1, 000 <b>hospital</b> <b>separations</b> for GI infections. Age was significantly associated with the risk of a nursing-sensitive outcome: compared with adolescents, toddlers had greater risk of GI infection (RR 9. 89; 95 % CI 6. 24, 15. 69); infants had 7. 74 times greater risk of LRTI (95 % CI 5. 11, 11. 75), while neonates had lower risks for sepsis (RR 0. 26; 95 % CI 0. 08, 0. 90) and physiologic/metabolic derangement (RR 0. 12; 95 % CI 0. 04, 0. 35). The risk of surgical wound infection was 7. 78 times greater (95 % CI 5. 10, 11. 86) for emergency admissions than elective admissions. Conclusions: Seven of the 13 defined nursing-sensitive outcomes occurred with sufficient frequency (> 100 events over the 10 year study period) to be potentially useful for monitoring the quality of nursing care. These nursing-sensitive outcomes are: LRTI, GI infection, pneumonia, surgical wound infection, physiologic/metabolic derangement, sepsis and postoperative cardiopulmonary complications. When used for quality improvement or to benchmark with other agencies, data need to be adjusted for, or stratified by age and admission type, to ensure equitable comparisons...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{effectiveness}} of primary care interventions provided by general practitioners (GP) remunerated under the fee-for-service (FFS) or alternative payment plan (APP), using hospitalization rates for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) in select Northern British Columbia (BC) communities. This study used BC Ministry of Health <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> data held at Population Data BC. Bivariate statistics were used to compare hospitalization rates for ACSC between both groups. The results indicate overall hospitalization rates of ACSC were higher in APP than FFS communities. Further, several ACSC showed varying hospitalization rates (asthma, pneumonia, COPD, diabetes, angina, gastroenteritis/dehydration and convulsion/epilepsy) and length of hospitalizations (convulsion/epilepsy and dental conditions) between both groups. In summary, this research informs policy on {{the effectiveness of}} GP remuneration adopted in Northern BC using hospitalization rates for ACSC. Further research is needed to further validate the findings of this study. [...] P. ii. The original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This study {{described}} the hospital morbidity of 194,persons with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), born between 1973 - 1992, who were identified through a major referral center for Saskatchewan children with disabling conditions. Computerized provincial <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> {{data were obtained}} for 84 % of 101 males and 77 % of 93 females. Complete hospitalization histories were obtained for 128 patients, and partial histories for 29 patients. This data provided information on 1, 556 hospitalizations from January 1, 1973 to November 30, 1992. At least 54 % of study group members experienced morbidity as newborns, and 83 % of all females and 91 % of all males had experienced {{at least one other}} hospitalization (excluding the newborn stay) during their life (based on provincial data combined with information from patient follow-up and record reviews). By November 1992 (provincial data only), the mean number of hospitalizations (SD) for males and females age 15 - 19 years was 8. 4 (7. 0) and 10. 2 (8. 1), respectively. For childre...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES. Prenatal care is {{commonly}} understood {{to have a}} beneficial impact on birthweight. This study describes socioeconomic differences in utilization of prenatal medical care and birthweight in a population with universal health insurance. METHODS. Measures of prenatal care utilization, incidence of pregnancy complications, and birthweight were obtained from physician reimbursement claims and <b>hospital</b> <b>separation</b> abstracts for 12, 646 pregnant women. Maternal socioeconomic status was derived from small-area census data. RESULTS. Infants born to women in the poorest income quintile had lower birthweights than infants born to wealthier women. Much of the difference {{was associated with a}} higher prevalence of complications, smoking, unmarried status, and inadequate prenatal care among low-income women. The difference in birthweight between adequate and less than adequate care groups was small, and the benefit associated with prenatal care was no greater among women with pregnancy complications. CONCLUSIONS. The lower utilization of prenatal care by poorer women accounted for a small proportion of the difference in birthweight. Socioeconomic differences in birthweight are primarily attributable to factors not directly influenced by early prenatal medical care...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundStudies of the {{population}} trends for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in the period 1970 to 2000 all indicated {{that the incidence of}} AAAs was increasing. It is not known whether this increase has continued. We hypothesized that the incidence of AAAs has begun to fall in Australia. MethodsAge-standardized national trends in mortality from AAAs were estimated for the period 1999 to 2006, and <b>hospital</b> <b>separations</b> (deaths or discharges) for AAAs were estimated for the period 1999 to 2008. Poisson regression models were constructed to estimate the relative change over time. ResultsThe age-standardized mortality rate from AAAs fell by an average of 6. 0 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 4. 7 - 7. 3) per annum in men and 2. 9 % (95 % CI, 1. 0 - 4. 7) in women. After adjusting for age, <b>hospital</b> <b>separations</b> for men decreased by an average of 2. 3 % (95 % CI, 1. 4 - 2. 7) per annum for nonruptured AAAs, and 5. 9 % (95 % CI, 5. 0 - 6. 6) for ruptured AAAs and for women decreased by an average of 2. 2 % (95 % CI, 1. 4 - 3. 0) per annum for nonruptured AAAs, and 5. 1 % (95 % CI, 3. 7 - 6. 5) for ruptured AAAs. Ruptured, compared with nonruptured, AAAs were proportionally more common in women compared with men. The age-specific trends in <b>separations</b> from <b>hospital</b> were all downward apart from nonruptured AAAs in individuals aged 80 years and over. ConclusionsThe rates of <b>separation</b> from <b>hospital</b> and mortality for AAAs in Australia have fallen since 1999. This suggests a true fall in incidence of AAAs. Although the reasons for this are unknown, it has implications for policy decisions about screening...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{trends in}} {{hospital}} service provision are measured using {{data on the}} numbers and nature of hospitals, on hospital expenditure and on hospital activity over recent years. The number of public acute care hospitals was fairly stable, however, bed numbers decreased. Hospital numbers rose for private hospitals, as did numbers of beds, particularly for group for-profit private hospitals. Recurrent health expenditure on hospitals {{as a proportion of}} all recurrent health expenditure fell, although it rose for private hospitals, and real increases in expenditure occurred for both public acute and private hospitals. Population rates for separations and patient days rose for private hospitals and were stable and fell, respectively, for public acute hospitals. Average length of stay decreased for both public acute and private hospitals, with increasing numbers of separations occurring on a same day basis. Increasing proportions of procedures were undertaken during same day stays, and in private <b>hospitals.</b> <b>Separation</b> rates varied geographically, with highest rates overall, and for public <b>hospitals</b> and overnight <b>separations,</b> for patients resident in remote centres and other remote areas. Highest rates for private hospitals were for patients resident in capital cities, other metropolitan centres and large rural centres...|$|R
40|$|This s t u 4 {{examines}} the socioeconomic status of NSW hospital patients in 1999 - 2000 and projects likely hospital costs to 2009 - 2010. It draws upon unique patient based datasets from NSW {{public and private}} hospitals that include <b>hospital</b> <b>separations,</b> {{as well as the}} associated treatment costs {{in each of the four}} years to 1999 - 2000. First, we examine whether patients of similar age had similar per patient hospital costs by socioeconomic status. Second, we examine whether patients requiring similar treatment had similar per patient hospital costs by considering patients treated for coronary heart disease. Third, we consider the impact that population ageing and changes in treatment propensities are likely to have on hospital usage and costs by 2009 - 2010, assuming that no changes occur in per unit treatment costs. Finally, we have estimated the additional impact of rising medical costs on these projections...|$|R
