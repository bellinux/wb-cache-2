It has always been surrounded by numerous tales and legends as well as pertinent and also obscure speculation. It was first mentioned in a document in 1625 as part of the border line between Alfter and Heimerzheim along the Roman aqueduct. According to a later source, it still fulfilled this function in 1717. Its former position can not be located accurately any more. It was not until 1727, under Prince Elector Clemens that the Iron Man was placed in its present position. It served as a marker of the main planning line while expanding the system of paths for hunting between Augustsburg Palace in Brühl and Herzogsfreude Palace in Röttgen.

Limiting cases of electroneutrality conditions involving protons as majority defects are examined, with special attention to water vapor dependences. When protons dominate the defect situation, the defect-related properties (e. g. conductivity, corrosion protectivity, sintering, creep) become dependent on the water vapor pressure. The effects and their magnitude are demonstrated by a few examples. A method for determining proton conductivity is briefly mentioned...|$|E
