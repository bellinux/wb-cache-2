Ventricular {{fibrillation}} {{threshold for}} AC shocks of long duration, in dogs with normal acid-base state. Earlier {{experimental studies of}} threshold ventricular fibrillating currents passing along the common accident pathway of forelimb to leg have shown {{a wide range of}} results for any one shock duration. In the present investigation the acid-base state of the experimental animals (dogs) was held within normal limits. It was found that whereas the mean minimum <b>fibrillating</b> <b>current,</b> 82 · 2 μA for 3 -second shocks, was within the values found by other workers, the range of results was reduced considerably to 67 - 101 μA. Further, when the shock duration was increased, in stages, up to 60 seconds, again keeping the acid-base state within normal limits, the mean minimum <b>fibrillating</b> <b>current</b> did not alter markedly (being 80 μA at 60 seconds) but the range of results progressively fell and was 73 - 88 μA at 60 seconds. In the light of these findings the mechanism of ventricular fibrillation is discussed...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} ventricular fibrillation (VF) threshold of anaesthetised dogs subjected to external application of electric shocks between a foreleg and a hindleg. The shocks were 2 - 15 ms sections of 50 Hz sine waveform starting at peak current and were applied at a known time in the heart cycle. The object of the experiment {{was to determine if}} there was an increase in cardiac susceptibility to electrically induced VF at 31 atmospheres absolute (atm abs) in a helium and oxygen environment. The duration and position of that part of the cardiac cycle most vulnerable to induction of VF by electrocution was found (seven animals) using 4 ms shocks and then the minimum <b>fibrillating</b> <b>current</b> for shocks of 2 - 15 ms (min FC 2 - 15) delivered at the most vulnerable point of the cycle (five animals). Body resistance was calculated from the data so gathered. Fibrillation thresholds were not changed by compression and there were no significant changes in the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle. Min FC 2 was significantly higher than for other durations under both control (3. 21 A, SD 1. 08) and test conditions (3. 26 A, SD 0. 39), p = 0. 001. There was no difference in body resistance at 31 atm abs (395. 5, SD 12. 9) from control values at 1 atm abs (396. 7, SD 10. 9). From these data it was concluded that the heart is no more susceptible to the induction of VF at 31 atm abs in a helium oxygen environment and additional safety factors are unnecessary from this point of view...|$|E
