5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man of my age and in the work <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> engaged.|$|E
25|$|Colin Cowdrey and John Edrich {{were unable}} to {{practice}} on Christmas Eve – {{mainly because of the}} drizzling rain but also because Cowdrey wanted to spend his birthday in comparative peace. Since both batsmen wanted to feel the ball on bat before the Test, I volunteered the use of the Hawthorn Indoor Cricket Centre, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a partner, for a two hour work-out on Christmas morning. It was quite a contrast to open the children's presents in the early hours and to open the bowling at the two English batsmen before lunch. My fifteen old son, Philip, thought the latter experience to be quite the best of his Christmas presents.|$|E
25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E

25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E

During his time in the Senate, Yeats further warned his colleagues: [...] "If you show that this country, southern Ireland, is going to be governed by Roman Catholic ideas and by Catholic ideas alone, you will never get the North... You will put a wedge {{in the midst of this}} nation". He memorably said of his fellow Irish Protestants, [...] "we are no petty people".|$|E

Cotto opened a cut over Malignaggi's right eye in the first round, which, according to Malignaggi, affected his performance {{over the course of}} the fight, by stating [...] "this was the first time <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> cut, and the blood kept going into my eye. And it bothered me the entire fight. I was not able to see very well. Cotto's a great fighter, but I'm disappointed, as I wanted to be the champion". Cotto won the fight by unanimous decision with scores of 116-111 and 115-112. Malignaggi suffered a fractured right orbital bone and his jaw was injured, he was taken to Roosevelt Hospital after the fight's outcome was announced.|$|E
500|$|In his memoir, Eminent Hipsters, Fagen {{notes that}} the cover figure [...] "wasn't {{supposed}} to be a stand-in for any particular jazz DJ," [...] but noted a few personalities from the period that factored into the creation: Ed Beach, Dan Morgenstern, Martin Williams, R.D. Harlan, [...] "Symphony Sid" [...] Torin, and what Fagen regarded as his [...] "main man", WEVD's Mort Fega. [...] "He was laid-back, knowledgeable, and forthright, the cool uncle you wished you'd had." [...] At the time of the album's release, he remembered that jazz music offered him an escape from the adults in his life: [...] "When I saw E.T.,' I realized that the E.T. in my bedroom was my Thelonious Monk records. Everything that he represented was totally unworldly in a way, although at the same time jazz to me seemed more real than the environment <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> living." [...] The Wall Street Journal Robert J. Toth writes, [...] "The cover adds another layer of autobiography. On the front, we see Mr. Fagen as a crew-cut deejay on the graveyard shift. On the back is his audience, a single lighted window in a row of tract homes — or maybe the artist as a young man, drinking in inspiration." [...] Robert Palmer, of The New York Times, continued in this line of thinking: [...] "Inside, there's a teenager with his ear next to a portable radio. He's playing it softly, so his parents won't wake up, and he can barely make out the sounds through the static. [...] The teenager was Donald Fagen." ...|$|E

"The {{secret of}} how to live without resentment or embarrassment in a world <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{different}} from everyone else," [...] Capp philosophically wrote (in Life magazine on May 23, 1960), [...] "was to be indifferent to that difference." [...] It was the prevailing opinion among his friends that Capp's Swiftian satire was, to some degree, a creatively channeled, compensatory response to his disability.|$|E

He was proud of ridding himself of [...] "the Puritanism <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> bred".

2500|$|In {{the same}} way he refused to use his {{surgical}} skill or food manufacturing business for personal financial gain, Dr. Kellogg did not make concerted efforts to profit from his medical inventions.

Otherwise, I should not have engaged in it as a commercial enterprise, but I have carried it on {{as a part of the}} general philanthropic work <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> engaged." ...|$|E
2500|$|Watts's explorations and {{teaching}} {{brought him into}} contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the human potential movement.

2500|$|As {{a present}} for his 16th {{birthday}} Weston's father gave him his first camera, a Kodak Bull's-Eye #2, which was a simple box camera. He took it on vacation in the Midwest, {{and by the time}} he returned home his interest in photography was enough to lead him to purchase a used 5 × 7inch view camera. He began photographing in Chicago parks and a farm owned by his aunt, and developed his own film and prints. Later he would remember that even at that early age his work showed strong artistic merit. He said, [...] "I feel that my earliest work of 1903 ‒ though immature ‒ is related more closely, both with technique and composition, to my latest work than are several of my photographs dating from 1913–1920, a period <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to be artistic." ...|$|E

Joan Rivers, whom I adored and met on The Tonight Show during my reign, was particularly relentless. Just when I figured she'd exhausted every possible Vanessa Williams joke, she'd have a whole new slew of them." [...] Williams would also later tell of one audition that she had during the late 1980s for a theatrical role. She was denied the role, however, because [...] "the wife of lyricist Ira Gershwin decreed: 'Over my dead body will that whore be in my show.'

2500|$|Norman {{finally broke}} through at the 1986 Open Championship {{for his first}} major title. Norman shot an {{efficient}} second round of 63 on Friday at Turnberry.

It did not come; but I fell into a kind of somnolent state, in which I suddenly felt as though I were sinking in swiftly flowing water. The rushing sound formed itself in my brain into a musical sound, the chord of E flat; major, which continually re-echoed in broken forms; these broken chords seemed to be melodic passages of increasing motion, yet the pure triad of E flat; major never changed, but seemed by its continuance to impart infinite significance to the element <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sinking. I awoke in sudden terror from my doze, feeling as though the waves were rushing high above my head.
