25|$|In 2007, some 245 {{newspapers}} and magazines (compared to only 91 in 1987) are 90% owned by private groups and independents. The Tunisian political parties {{have the right to}} publish their own newspapers, but those of the opposition parties have very limited editions (like Al Mawkif or Mouwatinoun).

In essence, the media was dominated by state authorities through the Agence Tunis Afrique Presse. This <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since,</b> as the media censorship by the authorities have been largely abolished, and self-censorship has significantly decreased. Nonetheless, the current regulatory framework and social and political culture mean that the future of press and media freedom is still unclear.|$|E
