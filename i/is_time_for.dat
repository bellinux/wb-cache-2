5|$|A small hill {{known as}} Bukit Puteri {{can be found}} nearby to Pasar Payang. The hill is about 200 metres high, located near the banks of Terengganu River. Because of its {{strategic}} location, it {{was used as a}} fortification by the sultans of the state. Old artefacts, a graveyard, and monuments can be found on top of the hill. During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a century-old brass bell known as genta will be rung to signify that it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> iftar, or the end of the fasting on that day.|$|E
5|$|It is Christmas, and Christine {{is having}} dinner with Marion, Ernie, Fung, Bobby and Adam. Christine unwraps her present to find an album of photos from her life. She says that she feels as if her life is {{flashing}} before her eyes, and then realises what is happening. Christine sits {{in a car wreck}} as emergency services attempt to free her. On the front seat & window screen, there are broken eggs from a shopping bag and the Stranger is explaining to the police that he stepped into the road causing the crash, and, though he could free Jack he could not reach Christine. At the dinner table, Jack enters dressed as a Nativity angel. Marion says it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Christine to move on. Christine says a final goodbye.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{finds his}} changes to Kazran's past have locked him {{out from the}} spire's controls, but the Doctor devises a solution: by having Abigail sing through {{one half of the}} broken sonic screwdriver, the other half, still in the shark, will {{resonate}} in the atmosphere and disrupt the storm to allow the ship to land safely. Kazran releases Abigail knowing this will be the last time, but Abigail understands and believes it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> them to share a Christmas Day. The plan works successfully, and the resulting cloud break-out creates snowfall that falls around the city. As the Doctor rejoins Amy and Rory and prepares to take young Kazran back to the past, old Kazran and Abigail enjoy one last shark-led carriage-ride together.|$|E
50|$|Rugby union matches <b>are</b> <b>timed</b> <b>for</b> 80 minutes, in two 40-minute halves. Canadian {{football}} games <b>are</b> <b>timed</b> <b>for</b> two 30-minute halves, {{each of which}} is further divided into 15-minute quarters.|$|R

5|$|The Oubangui {{people of}} west Africa plant a tree {{when a child}} is born. As the tree flourishes, so does the child but if the tree fails to thrive, the health of the child is {{considered}} at risk. When it flowers it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> marriage. Gifts are left at the tree periodically and when the individual dies, their spirit is believed to live on in the tree.|$|E
5|$|At Cortex's base, Uka Uka derides Cortex {{for failing}} to destroy Crash and replaces Cortex with his niece, Nina Cortex, despite protests from Neo, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger. Nina has Coco brainwashed and makes her {{participate}} {{in the construction of}} the Doominator. Throughout the course of the game, Crash and Aku Aku interrogate Tiny Tiger, Doctor N. Gin and Uka Uka on the whereabouts of Coco. When they confront Nina Cortex inside the Doominator robot, Nina summons her Arachnina cyborg and fights Crash. Crash eventually destroys the robot, liberating Coco and disabling the Doominator. The Doominator collapses and barely misses the Bandicoot home (and Crunch), sparing much of Wumpa Island. Escaping from the collapsed Doominator, Cortex praises Nina for betraying him, and promises to be more evil in the near future. The Bandicoots decide that it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> celebration, leading Crash to shout his first word in the series and the object of their celebration: pancakes.|$|E
5|$|Since clones cannot {{properly}} die, the Sakura and Syaoran clones are reconstructed by Yūko, {{who wishes}} to compensate them for how their existences were used. She causes them to be reborn as humans, who eventually meet and start living together. Sakura gives birth to the original Syaoran and they realize {{they are in their}} own past. They raise him until it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> him to begin the events of the series, then they seal themselves in a glass tube in order to await the time when Fei-Wang will attempt to shatter reality. After breaking free from the tube, Sakura and Syaoran reverse Fei-Wang's damage to the dimension using the magic they inherited from the sorcerer Clow Reed during their reincarnation. They disappear after Fei-Wang is killed by Kurogane, leaving behind only a feather which the original Sakura and Syaoran absorb.|$|E

60|$|My friends, {{do not be}} {{too sure}} that I have not been preaching Christ to you, and Christ's Spirit to you, and Christ's {{redemption}} too, most truly in this sermon, although I have mentioned none of them by name. There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> ornamenting the house, there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> repairing the wall, there <b>are</b> <b>times,</b> too, <b>for</b> thoroughly examining the foundation, because, if that be not sound, it is little matter what fine work is built up upon it; and there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> when, as David says, {{the foundations of the}} earth are out of course, when men have forgotten sadly the very first principles of society and religion.|$|R
25|$|July 4, Independence Day. In Barrow, this <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Eskimo games, {{such as the}} two-foot high {{kick and}} ear pull, with the winners going on to compete at the World Eskimo Indian Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Asker, a {{young and}} wealthy merchant, is upset. His aunt, Jahan, {{believes}} him to be ill, while his malevolent servant, Veli, conceals {{the reason for his}} master's “illness”; Suleyman, one of Asker's friends, reveals that it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Asker to get married.|$|E
25|$|A variant {{method of}} fish stocking, called ocean ranching, is under {{development}} in Alaska. There, the young salmon are {{released into the}} ocean far from any wild salmon streams. When it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> them to spawn, they return {{to where they were}} released, where fishermen can catch them.|$|E
60|$|And so {{the long}} day wore on till it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> me {{to dress for}} Pongo's party.|$|R
60|$|The white-haired {{minister}} rose, for the {{ten o'clock}} bell was ringing and it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> family worship.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hi! yi!' {{said the}} Subadar-Major, who was {{sweating}} profusely. 'Dam fools yonder, stand close-order! This <b>is</b> no <b>time</b> <b>for</b> close-order, it <b>is</b> the <b>time</b> <b>for</b> volleys. Ugh!' ...|$|R
25|$|Canada {{remains the}} only G7 country without {{specific}} protections in place to prevent genetic discrimination. As a result, Canadians who undergo genetic testing can be compelled by insurance companies and employers to disclose their results and may be denied employment or insurance based on their genes. It <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the law {{to catch up with}} science and bring an end to genetic discrimination in Canada.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} {{with some of}} my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E
25|$|Holidays {{celebrating the}} arrival of the Magi {{traditionally}} recognise a distinction between the date of their arrival and the date of Jesus' birth. The account given in the Gospel of Matthew does not state that they were present {{on the night of the}} birth; in the Gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary remain in Bethlehem until it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Jesus' dedication, in Jerusalem, and then return to their home in Nazareth.|$|E

25|$|This book {{revolves}} around several new {{characters in the}} Sword of Truth series. Jennsen, {{for most of her}} life, has been running from the assassins sent by Lord Rahl to kill her. Any ungifted child of the Lord Rahl must die. A stranger convinces her that running will do her no good for wherever she goes, Lord Rahl's soldiers will find her; it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> her to stop fleeing and fight back. If she wants to live, she must kill Lord Rahl.|$|E
25|$|At the Ordination of a priest, when it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the Great Entrance, the Bishop will drape the Aër {{over the}} {{candidate}}'s head and shoulders, {{and in this}} manner he will carry it in the procession. The candidate will not enter the Sanctuary {{with the rest of}} the clergy, but will remain standing at the Holy Doors. The Bishop will remove the Aër from his head and place it over the Gifts and cense them, after which the Ordination takes place.|$|E
25|$|Ball lock: Each time a ball {{goes into}} a {{specific}} hole or target, it is locked, and a new ball appears at the plunger. When the player has locked the required number of balls (often three), the multiball feature starts. On some games, the balls are physically locked in place by solenoid-actuated gates, but many newer machines use virtual ball locks instead, in which the game merely keeps count {{of the number of}} locked balls and then auto-launches them from the main ball trough when it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> them to be released.|$|E
60|$|Then Porler re-entered his tent. The {{band was}} playing and it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> {{him to make}} his ascension.|$|R
60|$|And yet--and yet--it was a right {{which was}} fulfilled. There were other rights. There was {{another side to}} the medal. Purity and high-mindedness--the beautiful, but {{unbearable}} tyranny. The beautiful, unbearable tyranny of Miss Frost! It <b>was</b> <b>time</b> now <b>for</b> Miss Frost to die. It <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> that perfected flower to be gathered to immortality. A lovely immortel. But an obstruction to other, purple and carmine blossoms which were in bud on the stem. A lovely edelweiss--but <b>time</b> it <b>was</b> gathered into eternity. Black-purple and red anemones were due, real Adonis blood, and strange individual orchids, spotted and fantastic. <b>Time</b> <b>for</b> Miss Frost to die. She, Alvina, who loved her as {{no one else would}} ever love her, with that love which goes to the core of the universe, knew that it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> her darling to be folded, oh, so gently and softly, into immortality. Mortality was busy with the day after her day. It <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Miss Frost to die. As Alvina sat motionless in the train, running from Woodhouse to Tibshelf, it decided itself in her.|$|R
50|$|In {{the days}} leading up to his death, Yogananda began hinting that it <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> him to leave the world.|$|R
25|$|When it <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a cell {{to enter}} S phase, {{complexes}} of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and cyclins phosphorylate Rb to pRb, allowing E2F-DP to dissociate from pRb and become active. When E2F is free it activates factors like cyclins (e.g. cyclin E and cyclin A), which push the cell through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases, and a molecule called proliferating cell nuclear antigen, or PCNA, which speeds DNA replication and repair {{by helping to}} attach polymerase to DNA. The initial phosphorylation is performed by Cyclin D/CDK4/CDK6, followed by additional phosphorylation by Cyclin E/CDK2. pRb remains phosphorylated throughout S, G2 and M phases.|$|E
25|$|On February 11, 2008, Kravitz was {{admitted}} to Miami Hospital suffering from severe bronchitis. He had been suffering {{from a series of}} severe respiratory tract infections since mid-January, and the illness developed into bronchitis. Kravitz's illness had forced him to postpone Canadian dates and his trip to Europe to promote his album It <b>Is</b> <b>Time</b> <b>for</b> a Love Revolution. On March 19, 2008 he canceled the South American part of his tour due to the same illness. The decision affected planned concerts in Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. In Argentina Kravitz had a performance in the biggest rock festival there, Quilmes Rock Fest. On July 15, 2008, Lenny was honored in Milan, Italy with the key to the city in a special toast ceremony for his work with the United Nations Millennium Campaign to end world poverty.|$|E
25|$|In a video titled “The Truth About the West Bank” {{released}} by the Israeli foreign ministry in June 2011, Ayalon presents a historical narrative meant to help wage the public diplomacy battle about Israel’s ongoing conflict with the Palestinians. In the video made in cooperation with StandWithUs, which {{is very similar to}} one released earlier by the Yesha council, the organization of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Ayalon asks viewers to stop referring to the West Bank as “occupied territories”. “It <b>is</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Israel to return to a ‘rights-based diplomacy’ and talk about the facts, rights, history and international law which are little known but give a dramatically different viewpoint to what is currently accepted,” he said after the video’s release. After the video was posted online, Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian Authority’s top negotiator, denounced the video as a “falsified account of history and international law”, but refused to participate in a public debate on the issues raised in the video proposed by Ayalon.|$|E
