5|$|The 1970 and 1971 seasons {{provided}} no suitable seeding candidates. Despite this, flights were conducted into Hurricane Ginger. Ginger {{was not a}} suitable storm for seeding, due to its diffuse, indistinct nature. The seeding <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect.</b> Ginger was the last seeding done by Project Stormfury.|$|E
5|$|A low calorie diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in many animals. This effect may involve {{a reduction in}} oxidative stress. While {{there is some evidence}} to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on aging.|$|E
5|$|According to Peter Woolley, {{director}} of Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll, {{the situation of}} the election was similar to the 1990 election, when underdog Senate candidate Christie Whitman, a Republican, nearly defeated well-known Senator Bill Bradley due to Democratic Governor Jim Florio's sales- and income-tax increases. By August, Woolley concluded that the tax increase had <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on Menendez's re-election chances.|$|E

It is unclear when Isabella first met Mortimer or when their relationship began, but they both wanted to see Edward and the Despensers removed from power. The King appealed for his son to return, and for Charles to intervene on his behalf, but this <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5|$|Virginia headed {{directly}} for the Union squadron. The battle opened when Union tug Zouave fired on the advancing enemy, and Beaufort replied. This preliminary skirmishing <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect.</b> Virginia did not open fire {{until she was}} within easy range of Cumberland. Return fire from Cumberland and Congress bounced off the iron plates without penetrating, although later some of Cumberlands payload lightly damaged Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top 20 in a stage. Unlike in the better known points classification in the Tour de France, the type of stage <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on what points were on offer– each stage had the same points available on the same scale. The win earned 25points, second place earned 22points, third 20, fourth 18, fifth 16, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 20th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints; three points for crossing the sprint line first, two points for second place, and one for third.|$|E

In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{presence}} of auxins in Lactifluus piperatus metabolites, it can be applied as a rooting hormone to aid the growth of seedlings of various species of plants, including hazel, beech and oak. In the 19th century, it was used as a folk cure for tuberculosis, though it <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect.</b> In more recent times, it has been found that L. piperatus can be used as an antiviral agent, and the latex has been used against viral warts.|$|E
5|$|Events {{such as the}} Pentridge Rising, the March of the Blanketeers and the Spa Fields meeting, all {{serve to}} {{indicate}} the breadth, diversity and widespread geographical scale of the demand for economic and political reform at the time. Peterloo <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on the speed of reform, but in due course {{all but one of}} the reformers' demands, annual parliaments, were met. Following the Great Reform Act of 1832, the newly created Manchester parliamentary borough elected its first two MPs. Five candidates including William Cobbett stood, and the Whigs, Charles Poulett Thomson and Mark Philips, were elected. Manchester became a Municipal Borough in 1837, and what remained of the manorial rights were purchased by the borough council.|$|E

5|$|Having {{recovered}} the ball, and with Virginia Tech having no remaining timeouts {{and no way}} to stop the clock, Florida State was able to run out the remaining time in the game and secure a 2722 victory. Towards the end of the game, players on each team acted with hostility towards each other, and several received personal foul penalties. The penalties <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on the final outcome of the game, and Florida State won the ACC Championship Game and an automatic bid to the 2006 Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Like NY33 before it, NY441 officially {{ended at}} NY21 in Marion {{when it was}} first assigned. By 1970, the east end of the route was moved to NY350 in Walworth. The change in NY441's {{alignment}} <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on the maintenance of the Walworth–Marion highway, however, as the Wayne County portion of NY441 was entirely county-maintained. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY441 from the Monroe County line to NY350 was transferred from Wayne County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the county received a part of NY21 in Williamson that connected to a state highway at only one end.|$|E

At the same time, Gian Gastone sank {{into a state}} of melancholy. In an attempt to rouse him from this condition, Cardinal Francesco Maria often summoned Gian Gastone to festivities at his villa, Lappeggi. However, these soirées <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> and Gian Gastone {{continued}} to weep unceasingly in his private rooms.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{models of}} {{economic}} defence in a group-foraging context {{predict that the}} frequency of aggressive interactions should decline as resource density increases. Studies with scaly-breasted munia show that the intensity of aggressive encounters was highest when patch location was signaled, {{and the effect of}} changing resource density depended on whether patch location was signaled or not. Signaling patch location was equivalent to making the resources more spatially predictable. Changing patch density <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on the number of aggressive encounters when the location of food was not signaled. When food location was signaled, increasing patch density resulted in the predicted {{decrease in the number of}} aggressive encounters.|$|E
5|$|The 1975 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was near average, with 17 tropical storms forming. Of these, 9 became hurricanes, and 4 became major hurricanes by reaching Category3 or {{higher on the}} Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The only notable storms are Hurricane Olivia, which killed 30 people, caused $30 million (1975 USD) in damage, and left thousands homeless when it made landfall in October; and an unnamed hurricane that developed at very high latitude, but <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on land. Hurricane Denise was the strongest storm of the year. Hurricanes Lily and Katrina passed close to Socorro Island and Tropical Storm Eleanor made landfall in Mexico. Hurricane Agatha sank a ship.|$|E
