25|$|Agner Fog (2007, 2008) has {{suggested}} {{that the best way to}} avoid confusion is to use the name Wallenius' noncentral <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution</b> for the distribution of a biased urn model where a predetermined number of items are drawn one by one in a competitive manner, while the name Fisher's noncentral <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution</b> is used where items are drawn independently of each other, so that the total number of items drawn is known only after the experiment.

Key Words: Random number generation, log-concave distributions, rejection method, simulation. 1. Introduction A discrete distribution on the integers is called log-concave if the probabilities p k satisfy p 2 k p kΓ 1 p k+ 1 for all k. Most of the classical discrete distributions like the binomial, Poisson, negative binomial and <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distributions</b> are of this type (the only non log-concave distribution that has a chapter of its own in [9] is the logarithmic series distribution). Among the less often used log-concave di [...] ...|$|R

25|$|No {{good way}} of calculating the {{variance}} is known. The best known method is to approximate the multivariate Wallenius distribution by a multivariate Fisher's noncentral <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution</b> with the same mean, and insert the mean as calculated above in the approximate formula for the variance of the latter distribution.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} of biased urn models {{is complicated by}} the fact that there is more than one noncentral <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution.</b> Which distribution you get depends on whether items (e.g. colored balls) are sampled one by one in a manner where there is competition between the items, or they are sampled independently of each other.|$|E
25|$|This can be {{illustrated}} by the following example. Assume that an opinion poll is conducted by calling random telephone numbers. Unemployed {{people are more likely}} to be home and answer the phone than employed people are. Therefore, unemployed respondents are likely to be over-represented in the sample. The probability distribution of employed versus unemployed respondents in a sample of n respondents can be described as a noncentral <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution.</b>|$|E
