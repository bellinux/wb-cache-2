40|$|We present algorithmic, {{complexity}} and implementation results for <b>the</b> problem of <b>isolating</b> <b>the</b> real roots of a univariate polynomial in Bα ∈ L[y], where L = (Q(α) {{is a simple}} algebraic extension of the rational numbers. We revisit two approaches for the problem. In the first approach, using resultant computations, we perform a reduction to a polynomial with integer coefficients and we deduce a bound of $O_B(N^ 8) ^ for <b>isolating</b> <b>the</b> real roots of Bα, where N is an upper bound on all the quantities (degree and bitsize) of the input polynomials. The bound becomes $O_B(N^ 7) $ if we use Pan's algorithm for <b>isolating</b> <b>the</b> real roots. In the second approach we <b>isolate</b> <b>the</b> real roots working directly on the polynomial of the input. We compute improved separation bounds for the roots and we prove that they are optimal, under mild assumptions. For <b>isolating</b> <b>the</b> real roots we consider a modified Sturm algorithm, and {{a modified version of}} Descartes' algorithm. For the former we prove a Boolean complexity bound of $O_B(N^{ 12 }) $ and for the latter a bound of $O_B(N^ 5) $. We present aggregate separation bounds and complexity results for <b>isolating</b> <b>the</b> real roots of all polynomials $B_{α_k}$, when $α_k$ runs over all the real conjugates of α. We show that we can <b>isolate</b> <b>the</b> real roots of all polynomials in $O_B(N^ 6) $. Finally, we implemented the algorithms in C as part of the core library of mathematica and we illustrate their efficiency over various data sets...|$|R

5|$|At this point, the 9th Division's advance {{began to}} be {{hampered}} {{by a lack of}} supplies which, along with the rugged terrain, resulted in slow progress. It was not until 9 September that they reached the Busu River. The 2/28th Infantry Battalion was leading the Australian advance at this stage and the soldiers waded across. The current was strong and many of the men– 13 of whom drowned– were swept downstream. Nevertheless, the 2/28th was able to establish a beachhead west of the river. At this point, heavy rain began to fall again, and the river rose once more, preventing any other units from crossing. This effectively <b>isolated</b> <b>the</b> single Australian battalion, which was then subjected to repeated attacks by the Japanese. On 14 September, the 26th Brigade was able to force its way across and the advance continued. Along the coast the 24th Brigade was held up by a determined Japanese defence in front of the Butibum River, which was the final crossing before Lae.
