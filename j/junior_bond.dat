40|$|International audienceWe study a defaultable firm's debt {{priority}} {{structure in}} a simple structural model where the firm issues senior and <b>junior</b> <b>bonds</b> and is subject to both liquidity and solvency risks. Assuming that the absolute priority rule prevails and that liquidation is immediate upon default, we determine the firm's interior optimal priority structure along with its optimal capital structure. We also obtain closed-form solutions for the market values of the firm's debt and equity. We find that {{the magnitude of the}} spread differential between <b>junior</b> and senior <b>bond</b> yields is positively, but not linearly related to the total debt level and the riskiness of assets. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis of probabilities of default and the term structure of credit spreads...|$|R

According to the authors, ESBies [...] "would be at least as safe as German bunds and approximately double the supply of euro safe assets when protected by a 30%-thick junior tranche".

40|$|We {{study the}} value of senior and <b>junior</b> <b>bonds</b> subject to random default, {{deviations}} from absolute priority, and random recovery by modeling the default decision as a Poisson process. The model is a cross between the structural formulation where default decisions are made on strictly rational grounds and the surprise approach where the decision is made independent of the firm’s financial strength. We show the impact of various parameters such as the debt-equity mix, firm-value volatility, the default propensity, and the bargaining position of the various claimants to firm value on the credit spread of both senior and junior debt...|$|R

50|$|It was {{not known}} who wrote The Adventures of James <b>Bond</b> <b>Junior</b> 003½, {{although}} many authors have been named as possibilities, including Roald Dahl and Kingsley Amis. Amis was usually seen as unlikely since {{a year later he}} released Colonel Sun under the pseudonym Robert Markham, however, unlike R. D. Mascott, Amis's authoring of Colonel Sun was never a secret. Amis's writing style was also not similar to Mascott. Roald Dahl on the other hand did share some similarities specifically with one book he wrote in 1975, Danny, the Champion of the World. In 1967, Roald Dahl completed the screenplay for You Only Live Twice for Eon Productions, the same year The Adventures of James <b>Bond</b> <b>Junior</b> 003½ was published. Although there was evidence to suggest Dahl may have written 003½, there was equally as much evidence to suggest he had not.|$|R

40|$|Completing {{the banking}} union is an urgent project facing the EU, given the eurozone’s {{continued}} vulnerability to idiosyncratic liquidity shocks to national banking systems. The proposed {{changes to the}} European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS) under consideration by the European Commission could open {{the way to a}} satisfactory compromise between the twin needs to reduce legacy risks in banks’ balance sheets and to provide greater risk-sharing and a fiscal backstop for both the Resolution and the EDIS Funds – while continuing to exclude any sharing of past losses. With such a compromise, financial fragmentation would likely recede rapidly, leading to a larger role by private capital in cushioning real and financial idiosyncratic shocks. EDIS could move forward immediately by providing in its early phase that the European Stability Mechanism would provide a liquidity line to national deposit guarantee schemes that had exhausted their funds, with no sharing of losses. Meanwhile, risk-reduction would accelerate through the stronger policies already established by the Single Supervisory Mechanism for the reduction of non-performing loans and a fresh approach to the reduction of banks’ sovereign exposures, based on {{a modified version of the}} large exposure prudential policy. Direct risk-weighting of national sovereigns would be excluded. The ultimate anchor of a stable banking union would be credible policies to reduce excessive sovereign debt-to-GDP ratios. This paper argues that a combination of a strengthened debt rule in the Stability and Growth Pact and a market discipline mechanism entailing the obligation to issue <b>junior</b> <b>bonds,</b> subject to restructuring, for the countries violating the common budgetary rules, could offer a suitable way forward to restore the credibility of the Pact. It also argues that effective policy coordination within the eurozone also requires greater symmetry of policy obligations by the member states, which may be built into the European Semester through an appropriate revision of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on corporate pension plan underfunding and securities valuation. The first essay presents evidence that sell-side stock analysts systematically underreact to pension underfunding information when they forecast firm earnings and such underreaction is associated with future stock returns. The second essay examines the effect of pension obligation overhang on ratings of a firm 2 ̆ 7 s bond issues with different seniority. It shows that both the level and changes of pension obligations have significant effects on bond ratings and bond liquidity of non-senior secured issues (including senior unsecured, senior subordinate, subordinate, and <b>junior</b> subordinate <b>bonds),</b> but have no effects on bond ratings of senior secured issues. Finally, the third essay reports that firms manipulate earnings to meet or beat analysts 2 ̆ 7 expectations through opportunistically increasing the expected {{rate of return on}} pension plan assets. ...|$|R
50|$|The Adventures of James <b>Bond</b> <b>Junior</b> 003½ is {{considered}} a failed attempt at launching a youth-oriented line of fiction aimed at 8 to 14 year olds. A moderately successful television series {{of the same name}} was launched in 1991, produced by Eon Productions / Danjaq. The success of the show spawned numerous novelizations, a video game, and comic books. Unrelated to 003½, Ian Fleming Publications began publishing a successful youth-oriented line of Young Bond adventures featuring James Bond as a teenager in the 1930s beginning in 2005.|$|R

50|$|Prior to {{the release}} of SilverFin, the idea of a Young Bond series had not gone over too well with the fans of the more {{traditional}} Bond literature and had come under heavy fire, with some fans comparing it to an unsuccessful 1960s attempt by Bonds publishers to launch a youth-oriented line of fiction that resulted in only one book: The Adventures of James <b>Bond</b> <b>Junior</b> 003½ written by the pseudonymous R. D. Mascott. There was also a moderately successful James Bond Jr. television series in the early 1990s aimed at children that dealt with Bonds supposed nephew.|$|R
50|$|James Bond Jr. is {{a fictional}} {{character}} {{described as the}} nephew of Ian Fleming's masterspy, James Bond. The name was first used in 1967 for a spinoff novel entitled The Adventures of James <b>Bond</b> <b>Junior</b> 003½ authored by the never clarified pseudonym R. D. Mascott. The idea of Bond having a nephew was used again in 1991 in an American animated series for television, in which the title character defeats threats {{to ensure the safety}} of the free world. The series was mildly successful, spawning a six-volume novelization series by John Peel (writing as John Vincent), a 12-issue comic book series by Marvel Comics published in 1992, and video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES.|$|R
5000|$|Per Fine Ounce is {{the title}} of an {{unpublished}} novel by Geoffrey Jenkins featuring Ian Fleming's James Bond.

The Adventures of James <b>Bond</b> <b>Junior</b> 003½, a novel written by the pseudonymous R. D.

50|$|Although {{there have}} been shark {{sightings}} in the bay, {{there have been}} no reported shark sightings in the cove. Just beyond the wall is a public waterfront promenade, where fans can watch the game through the wall's archways, free of charge, albeit with a somewhat obstructed view. Across the cove from the ballpark is McCovey Point and China Basin Park, featuring a statue of McCovey {{at the mouth of the}} Cove. At his feet are small plaques commemorating the winners of the Willie Mac Award, named in McCovey's honor. Along the southern shore of the cove, between McCovey Point and the O'Doul Bridge, is a walkway featuring plaques showing the Opening Day Roster of every Giants team from 1958 through 1999.

5000|$|Children's fiction critic Margery Fisher {{was more}} critical: [...] "003 1/2 {{seems to be}} satire on three levels. First, with its bullion robbers and the indomitable amateur boy who cracks the code, as it were, the book sends up the <b>junior</b> thriller; young <b>Bond</b> with his blacked and infra-red camera and judo {{principles}} ("Don't go against the enemy, go with him") is a remote cousin of Miss Blyton's water-pistol-carrying kids. Then (and I am less certain of the author's intention here) the fast-moving events and casual cruelty of the story may be a satire on the exploits of Jimmy's notorious uncle; if so, it is a satire many readers won't see or won't want to. Mascott has given us glimpses of the sordid and a nearer approach to danger (and one brilliant female character drawn in the round). But one swallow doesn't make a summer and all Sheelagh's gibes and kisses and dirty clothes don't make this a genuinely realistic book." ...|$|R
