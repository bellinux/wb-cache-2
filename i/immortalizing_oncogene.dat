40|$|A CNS catecholaminergic cell line, Cath. a, was {{established}} by targeted oncogenesis in transgenic mice. Cath. a cells express neuronal properties but lack neuronal morphology. Here, we describe a variant of Cath. a, called CAD (Cath. a-differentiated), in which reversible morphological differentiation can be initiated by removal of serum or exogenously added protein from the medium. In serum- or protein-free media, CAD cells stop proliferating and extend long processes. Differentiated CAD cells can be maintained without serum or protein for at least 6 weeks. CAD cells are distinct from Cath. a cells; most significant, the original <b>immortalizing</b> <b>oncogene,</b> SV 40 T antigen, was spontaneously lost. By immunostaining or immunoblotting, we show that CAD cells express neuron-specific proteins, such as class III �-tubulin, GAP- 43, SNAP- 25, and synaptotagmin, but not GFAP. Ultrastructurally, processes from differentiated CA...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{cultures}} of rat embryo fibroblasts {{have been shown}} to be resistant to transformation by dominant oncogenes such as v-src. We sought to determine if similar resistance is displayed by primary epithelial cells, and, if so, whether an <b>immortalizing</b> <b>oncogene</b> such as E 1 A could enhance transformation of primary epithelial cells by v-src. Transformation of primary rat epithelial cells by v-src was synergistically enhanced when E 1 A expression plasmids were cotransfected with a v-src expression plasmid. Foci were more numerous and observed earlier (9 to 14 days) with E 1 A plus v-src than with v-src alone (18 to 28 days). This cotransformation ability was abrogated by deletions in CR 1 or CR 2 of E 1 A, which encode the binding regions for the pRb family and are responsible for E 1 A-mediated cell cycle activation. Mutations in the p 300 binding site or the second exon, which abolish immortalization, did not affect v-src cooperation, in contrast to ras and adenovirus E 1 B. While kinase activation was required for growth in soft agar, differential activation of Src kinase did not correlate with transformation efficiency. Cell morphology and actin structures were not dramatically impacted by E 1 A expression; thus, hypertransformation, as previously described for ras cotransformation, was not observed with v-src and second-exon mutants of E 1 A. However, growth rates for cells expressing both E 1 A and v-Src were higher than those for cells expressing only v-Src. These results suggest that functions involved in cell cycle activation encoded by E 1 A first exon can enhance v-src transformation of primary epithelial cells...|$|E
40|$|In the {{developing}} brain, differentiation of neural precursors into neurons or glial cells occurs {{in response to}} neurotrophic factors acting on the cell surface. Intracellular signaling mechanisms that relay information to initiate differentiative responses of neural precursor cells are poorly understood. To investigate whether stimulation of the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway participates in differentiative responses of cells in {{the developing}} CNS, we performed experiments using both conditionally immortalized neural precursor cells (RC 2. E 10 cells) and primary cultures of cells from developing rat cortex. Initially, we determined that RC 2. E 10 cells retain phenotypic features of neural precursors after inactivation of the <b>immortalizing</b> <b>oncogene,</b> a temperature-sensitive mutant of the simian virus 40 large-T antigen (SV 40 T). We found that, once SV 40 T is inactivated, RC 2. E 10 cells cease to divide and die. However, RC 2. E 10 cells can proliferate {{in the presence of}} basic fibroblast growth factor. In addition, they express nestin, a marker of neural precursor cells. Both RC 2. E 10 cells and primary cortical precursor cells undergo astroglial differentiation in response to cAMP stimulation by treatment with 8 -bromo-cAMP. In both cases, cAMP-induced astrocyte differentiation is characterized by morphological changes, stimulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, downregulation of nestin expression, and decreased proliferation. No increases in the expression of neuronal or oligodendrocytic markers were observed. Our results support the notion that the developing CNS contains neural precursor cells with the capacity of undergoing astrocyte differentiation in response to increased intracellular cAMP concentrations.

40|$|Transactivator {{proteins}} of the bovine leukemia (BLV) {{and human}} T-lymphotropic (HTLV) viruses increase {{long terminal repeat}} (LTR) -directed viral gene expression and act as <b>immortalizing</b> <b>oncogenes</b> in tissue culture. We report here that the BLV tax gene sequence contains an enhancer-like activity. The X long open reading frame was cloned upstream of the β-globin promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. In the presence of tax sequences, up to sevenfold enhancement of CAT expression was observed. A computer-assisted homology search revealed {{the presence of a}} consensus enhancer core sequence (GTGTTGTTGGTTG) into the third exon of the 2. 1 -kb X mRNA. These studies demonstrate that the tax gene contains a transcriptional enhancer which could be involved in early viral gene expression in vivo. © 1991.

40|$|The {{transcription}} factor PEA 1 (a homologue of AP 1 and c-jun) is highly active in several fibroblast cell lines, compared to its low activity in a myeloma and an embryo-carcinoma (EC) cell line. Serum components {{are essential to}} attain these high levels of PEA 1 activity in fibroblasts. This serum requirement is abrogated by transformation with the oncogenes c-Ha-ras, v-src and polyoma middle T (Py-MT) but not by immortalization with polyoma large T (Py-LT), v-myc, c-myc or SV 40 large T (SV 40 T). Expression in myeloma cells of the same transforming oncogenes, as well as v-mos and c-fos, activates PEA 1, whereas expression of the same <b>immortalizing</b> <b>oncogenes</b> and EIA does not. These results suggest that a common target for transforming oncogenes is PEA 1. Serum components {{have no effect on}} PEA 1 activity in the myeloma and EC cell lines. In contrast, retinoic acid treatment of F 9 EC cells augments PEA 1 activity. These results suggest that transforming oncogene expression compensates for the absence of cell type-specific factors which are required to activate PEA 1. Activation of PEA 1 may lead to altered transcription of a set of transformation-related genes...|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{cell lines}} have greatly {{improved}} {{our understanding of}} many important biological questions. Generation of cell lines is facilitated {{by the introduction of}} <b>immortalizing</b> <b>oncogenes</b> into cell types of interest. One gene known to immortalize many different cell types in vitro encodes the simian virus 40 (SV 40) large tumor (T) antigen (TAg). To circumvent the need for gene insertion in vitro to generate cell lines, we created transgenic mice harboring the SV 40 TAg gene. Since previous studies have shown that TAg expression in transgenic mice is associated with tumorigenesis and aberrant development, we utilized a thermolabile TAg [from a SV 40 strain, tsA 58, temperature sensitive (ts) for transformation] to reduce the levels of functional TAg present in vivo. To direct expression to a broad range of tissues, we used the mouse major histocompatibility complex H- 2 Kb promoter, which is both widely active and can be further induced by interferons. tsA 58 TAg mRNA was expressed in tissues of all animals harboring the hybrid construct. Development of all tissues was macroscopically normal except for thymus, which consistently showed hyperplasia. Fibroblast and cytokeratin+ thymic epithelial cultures from these mice were readily established without undergoing crisis and were conditionally immortal in their growth; the degree of conditionality was correlated with the levels of tsA 58 TAg detected. One strain of H- 2 Kb-tsA 58 mice has been bred through several generations to homozygosity and transmits a functional copy of the transgene...|$|R

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{response to}} oncogenic Ras {{depends upon the}} presence or absence of cooperating mutations. In the absence of <b>immortalizing</b> <b>oncogenes</b> or genetic lesions, activation of the Ras/Raf pathway results in a p 21 Cip 1 -dependent cellular arrest. The human papillomavirus oncoprotein E 7 transforms primary cells in cooperation with Ras and abolishes p 21 Cip 1 -mediated growth arrest in the presence of various antimitogenic signals. Here we have utilized a conditional Raf molecule to investigate the effects of E 7 on p 21 Cip 1 function in the context of Raf-induced cellular arrest. E 7 bypassed Raf-induced arrest and alleviated inhibition of cyclin E-CDK 2 without suppressing Raf-specific synthesis of p 21 Cip 1 or derepressing p 21 Cip 1 -associated CDK 2 complexes. Activation of Raf led to nuclear accumulation of p 21 Cip 1, and we provide evidence that this effect is mediated by inhibition of Akt, a regulator of p 21 Cip 1 localization. Loss of Akt activity appears to be an important event in the cellular arrest associated with Raf-induction, since maintenance of Akt activity was necessary and sufficient to bypass Raf-induced arrest. In agreement, expression of E 7 sustained Akt activity and reduced nuclear accumulation of p 21 Cip 1, resulting in decreased association between p 21 Cip 1 and cyclin E-CDK 2. Taken together, these data suggest that E 7 inhibits p 21 Cip 1 function in the context of Raf signaling by altering Raf-Akt antagonism and preventing the proper subcellular localization of p 21 Cip 1. We propose that E 7 elicits a proliferative response to Raf signaling by targeting p 21 Cip 1 function via a novel mechanism...|$|R
40|$|STUDIES OF THE {{physiological}} {{functions of the}} human ovaries have recently made significant progress, and important findings on the regulation mechanisms of oogenesis, folliculogenesis, ovarian atresia, and steroidogenesis continue to increase (1). Primary culture systems of human granulosa cells isolated from ovarian follicles have often been used for the studies of granulosa cells (2 – 11). Human granulosa cells are obtainable mainly from in vitro fertilization programs. However, they are only obtainable in small numbers, {{and they do not}} survive in culture for extended cell generations. Such difficulties in obtaining and maintaining primary culture systems and also in preparing uniform cell populations in sizable amounts have often prevented the performance of the detailed analyses on molecular and cell biological levels. During the last 2 decades, although several animal ovarian granulosa cell lines, mostly <b>immortalized</b> by <b>oncogenes</b> and oncoviruses have been reported (12 – 25), only five human granulosa cell lines have been established (26 – 30).

40|$|Eukaryotic {{cellular}} mRNAs have a 5 $ sp prime$ cap structure (m 7 GpppX) {{that facilitates}} their binding to ribosomes and {{is required for}} efficient translation. An initiation factor, elF- 4 F, mediates {{the function of the}} cap and consists of three subunits. elF- 4 E, one of the subunits which binds the cap directly, is present in the cell in limiting amounts. We demonstrated that overexpression of elF- 4 E in NIH 3 T 3 and Rat 2 fibroblasts causes their tumorigenic transformation. We have also shown that elF- 4 E cooperates with an <b>immortalizing,</b> nuclear <b>oncogene</b> (ie. v-myc or E 1 A) to cause transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts. These findings categorize elF- 4 E as a proto-oncogene. The mode of transformation by elF- 4 E {{is similar to that of}} Ras-like proteins. To further elucidate the mechanism of elF- 4 E transformation we determined Ras activity in elF- 4 E transformed REFs. We detected an activation of Ras in eIF- 4 E overexpressing cells as compared to parental REFs. In addition, overexpression of GAP (GTPase activating-protein), a negative regulator of Ras, suppressed the transformation of REFs by elF- 4 E. In summary we have established an important link between Ras, which plays a key role in cellular signal transduction, and elF- 4 E which is a critical component of the translation machinery...|$|R
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes several {{benign and}} {{malignant}} disorders of lymphoid and epithelial origin. EBV-related tumors display distinct patterns of viral latent gene expression, {{of which the}} BamHI-A rightward frame 1 (BARF 1) is selectively expressed in carcinomas, regulated by cellular differentiation factors including ΔNp 63 α. BARF 1 functions as a viral <b>oncogene,</b> <b>immortalizing</b> and transforming epithelial cells of different origin by acting as a mitogenic growth factor, inducing cyclin-D expression, and up-regulating antiapoptotic Bcl- 2, stimulating host cell growth and survival. In addition, secreted hexameric BARF 1 has immune evasive properties, functionally corrupting macrophage colony stimulating factor, as supported by recent functional and structural data. Therefore, BARF 1, an intracellular and secreted protein, not only has multiple pathogenic functions but also can function as a target for immune responses. Deciphering the role of BARF 1 in EBV biology will contribute to novel diagnostic and treatment options for EBV-driven carcinomas. Herein, we discuss recent insights on the regulation of BARF 1 expression and aspects of structure-function relating to its oncogenic and immune suppressive propertie...|$|R
40|$|Hemidesmosome (HD) is a transmembrane {{complex that}} mediates {{attachment}} of epithelial cells {{to the basement}} membrane. Abnormal expression of HD components {{has been reported in}} several types of human cancers and is believed {{to play a role in}} tumor invasion and metastasis. Using differential gene display, we have identified downregulation of BPAG 1 expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. BPAG 1 is a major component of hemidesmosome. In the present study, we have extended our work to investigate the expression pattern of other components in the HD complex, namely, BPAG 2, ITGα 6 and ITGβ 4 in three distinct biological groups of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells: (a) non-malignant nasopharyngeal epithelial cells established from primary culture of nasopharyngeal explants, (b) non-malignant nasopharyngeal epithelial cells <b>immortalized</b> by viral <b>oncogenes,</b> SV 40 or HPV 16 E 6 E 7, and (c) nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. Both non-malignant primary cultured nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell lines expressed all the HD components examined, although the immortalized cells expressed a lower level of HD components compared with the non-malignant nasopharyngeal cells established from primary culture. In contrast, downregulation of HD components is commonly observed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Loss of HD expression in NPC may be associated with the undifferentiated properties of NPC cells and may have prognostic significance. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Early-passage rat kidney {{cells were}} immortalized or rescued from {{senescence}} {{with three different}} oncogenes: viral promoter-driven c-myc, H-ras (Val- 12), and adenovirus type 5 E 1 a. The normal c-myc and H-ras (Gly- 12) were unable to immortalize cells under similar conditions. Quantitation of RNA in the ras-immortalized lines demonstrated that the H-ras oncogene was expressed at a level equivalent {{to that of the}} normal H-ras gene in established human or rat cell lines. Cell lines <b>immortalized</b> by different <b>oncogenes</b> were found to have distinct growth responses to individual growth factors in a short-term assay. E 1 a-immortalized cells were largely independent of serum growth factors, whereas c-myc-immortalized cells responded to serum better than to epidermal growth factor and insulin. H-ras-immortalized cells responded significantly to insulin alone and gave a maximal response to epidermal growth factor and insulin. Several cellular genes associated with platelet-derived growth factor stimulation, including c-myc, were expressed at high levels in the H-ras-immortalized cells, and c-myc expression was deregulated, suggesting that the H-ras oncogene has provided a "competence" function. H-ras-immortalized cells could not be morphologically transformed by secondary transfection with a long terminal repeat-c-myc oncogene, but secondary transfection of the same cells with H-ras (Val- 12) produced morphologically transformed colonies that had 20 - to 40 -fold higher levels of H-ras oncogene expression. Thus, transformation in this system is dependent on high levels of H-ras oncogene expression rather than on the presence of activated H-ras and c-myc oncogenes in the same cell...|$|R

Immune suppression entirely depended on GM-CSF-driven accumulation of CD 11 b(+) /Gr- 1 (+) myeloid suppressor cells (MSC) in secondary lymphoid organs. To further investigate the nature and properties of MSC, we immortalized CD 11 b(+) /Gr- 1 (+) cells isolated from the spleens of immunosuppressed mice, using a retrovirus encoding the v-myc and v-raf <b>oncogenes.</b> <b>Immortalized</b> cells expressed monocyte/macrophage markers (CD 11 b, F 4 / 80, CD 86, CD 11 c), but they differed from previously characterized macrophage lines in their capacities to inhibit T lymphocyte activation. Two MSC lines, MSC- 1 and MSC- 2, were selected based upon their abilities to inhibit Ag-specific proliferative and functional CTL responses. MSC- 1 line was constitutively inhibitory, while suppressive functions of MSC- 2 line were stimulated by exposure to the cytokine IL- 4. Both MSC lines triggered the apoptotic cascade in Ag-activated T lymphocytes by a mechanism requiring cell-cell contact. Some well-known membrane molecules involved in the activation of apoptotic pathways (e. g., TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, Fas ligand, TNF-alpha) were ruled out as candidate effectors for the suppression mechanism. The immortalized myeloid lines represent a novel, useful tool {{to shed light on}} the molecules involved in the differentiation of myeloid-related suppressors {{as well as in the}} inhibitory pathway they use to control T lymphocyte activation...|$|R
40|$|Senescence is a {{specific}} physiological stage of cells characterized by long population doubling time. It accounts for the inability of normal somatic cells to undergo indefinite cell division. As the number of population doublings increase, cell cycle regulatory mechanisms come into play and signal cells to exit the cell cycle and become senescent. Senescence has been implicated in the aging process and may function as a tumor suppressor mechanism in human cells. The ability to measure the degree of cellular senescence is important in understanding the biological processes regulating cell aging and immortalization. Senescent cells exhibit an enzyme termed senescence-associated ß-galactosidase (SA-ß-Gal) which is detected at pH 6. 0 via histochemical staining. Cells <b>immortalized</b> by viral <b>oncogenes</b> often enter a stage of crisis at the early phase of immortalization. The cells at crisis have a long population doubling time. Cells at the crisis stage resemble senescent cells and the expression of SA-ß-Gal {{may be used to}} monitor the process of immortalization. In this study the expression profile of SA-ß-Gal was examined in human ovarian surface epithelial cells (HOSE 6 - 3) undergoing immortalization by the human papilloma viral oncogene E 6 and E 7 (HPV E 6 and E 7). Our results showed a low percentage (12. 0 %) of HOSE 6 - 3 cells expressing SA-ß-Gal activity at the pre-crisis stage. The percentage of HOSE 6 - 3 cells expressing SA-ß-Gal activity was highest (39. 2 %) at the crisis stage. When HOSE 6 - 3 cells achieved immortalized status there was a sharp decrease in cells (1. 3 %) expressing SA-ß-Gal activity. In addition, an inverse relationship between the expression of SA-ß-Gal activity and telomerase activity was noted in cells undergoing immortalization. The results confirm that the SA-ß-Gal enzyme is a good marker for monitoring the population of cells undergoing senescence at different stages of immortalization and that telomerase activation is a characteristic feature of post-crisis cells. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
