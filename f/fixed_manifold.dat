We {{elaborate on the}} role of the complex three– form flux in the IIB duals to these fixed point theories, primarily using field theory techniques. We study the moduli space at a fixed point and find that it is either the two (complex) dimensional ALE space or three–dimensional generalized conifold, depending on the type of three-form flux that is present. We describe the exactly marginal operators that parameterize the <b>fixed</b> <b>manifolds</b> and find the operators which preserve the dimension of the moduli space. We also study deformations by arbitrary superpotentials W(Φi) for the adjoints. We invoke the a–theorem to show that there are no dangerously irrelevant operators like Tr Φ k+ 1 i, k> 2 in the N = 2 quiver gauge theories. The moduli space of the IR fixed point theory generally contains orbifold singularities if W(Φi) does not give a mass to the adjoints. Finally we examine some nonconformal N = 1 quiver theories.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the question of}} when different surgeries on a knot can produce identical manifolds. We show that given a knot in a homology sphere, unless the knot is quite special, there is a bound {{on the number of}} slopes that can produce a <b>fixed</b> <b>manifold</b> that depends only on this <b>fixed</b> <b>manifold</b> and the homology sphere the knot is in. By finding a different bound on the number of slopes, we show that non-null-homologous knots in certain homology RP^ 3 's are determined by their complements. We also prove the surgery characterisation of the unknot for null-homologous knots in L-spaces. This leads to showing that all knots in some lens spaces are determined by their complements. Finally, we establish that knots of genus greater than 1 in the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2, 3, 7) are also determined by their complements.

These are generalizations of a finiteness theorem of secondary characteristic classes of transversely projective foliations on a <b>fixed</b> <b>manifold</b> by Brooks-Goldman and Heitsch to other transverse structures.
