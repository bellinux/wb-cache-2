Costabel <b>Inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> defined as a local or general response of living tissue to injury or {{to the presence of}} injurious agents. Teleologically, inflammation is presu-mably designed as both a protective and reparative res-ponse, which aims at restoration of optimal organ function. Thus, <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> viewed as an essentially self-curtailing process-loop, in which a complex series of interdigitating cytological, biochemical, and immuno-logical components serve to return to a physiological baseline of optimal organ function. Processes which constitute inflammation form an in-tricate functional network, in which almost every singl...|$|R

5|$|Inflammation of the cervix is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, <b>inflammation</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics <b>may</b> <b>be</b> given as treatment.|$|R
