5|$|What the Getty Villa achieves, {{first by}} seclusion, then by control of access, and {{ultimately}} through the architecture, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of detachment from its immediate environment.|$|E
5|$|The western slopes fall {{smoothly}} to {{the head}} of Thirlmere reservoir, and the tiny church at Wythburn. There are rougher areas, High and Comb Crags in particular, but these do little to change the overall impression of high moorland. The lower slopes have been planted with conifers as part of the Thirlmere Forest, but above this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of wide open space. Nethermost Pike's toehold on the valley is shifted a little to the south, relative to its position on the ridge. This is because Whelpside and Birkside Gills, its boundary streams, both run south-west, rather than flowing straight down the slope.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{that the}} close home life the women/girls have known since {{childhood}} {{is about to}} be torn apart. The narrator, the adult Michael, tells us this is indeed what happens.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of unreality {{about it}} to him, but he only laughed.|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} {{religions}} being {{followed by the}} people of this city. Usually there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of harmony and co-existence without incident. However, there have been situations in the past in which this delicate social fabric has broken down. Today the city {{is considered to be a}} great example of communal equality.|$|E
25|$|Deep democracy, as the {{psychologist}} Arnold Mindell {{points out in}} his book, The Leader as Martial Artist, is a timeless feeling of shared compassion for all living beings. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of the value and importance of the whole, including and especially our own personal reality. Deeply democratic people value every organ in their body {{as well as their}} inner feelings, needs, desires, thoughts and dreams.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{in which}} this kind of {{additivity}} expresses a fundamental postulate {{that goes beyond the}} simplest ideas of classical closed system thermodynamics; the extensivity of some variables is not obvious, and needs explicit expression; indeed one author {{goes so far as to}} say that it could be recognized as a fourth law of thermodynamics, though this is not repeated by other authors.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of glaring {{mounting}} {{light through}} the window which gave on the cliff.|$|R

60|$|Amidst such caressing {{signs of}} mutual fear they parted. The effect that clung and gnawed within Grandcourt <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of {{imperfect}} mastery.|$|R
25|$|Klingons see {{something}} that isn't growing as something that is dying. A Klingon fights not for sport but to gain an advantage for the Empire, for his family and for himself. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of paranoia, as others are constantly watching all one's activities in order to seek advancement. This leads to a morality that Federation races see as often cruel and remorseless.|$|E
25|$|According to some scholars, {{what both}} {{religion}} and spirituality {{have in common}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of the supernatural, while others see supernatural thought unnecessary for spirituality. In colonial America, some people had a supernatural curiosity that was often combined with free-thinking rationalism advocated by intellectuals such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Robert Fuller has characterized the SBNR phenomenon as a mix of intellectual progressivism and mystical hunger, impatient with the piety of established churches.|$|E
25|$|Croatian, Portuguese and Italian fishing families, {{many of them}} Catholic, founded San Pedro. Content {{with the}} beauty of the hills rising from the harbor, they built their homes, their church, their {{businesses}} and dutifully produced large families to do the same. More than 100 years later, some of their children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren live in those family homes, work still on the docks or in town and worship still at Mary Star of the Sea. The town's population has remained steady for the last two decades, and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of continuity that is palpable in this town, an intimacy--among the people, and between the people and the place.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the added}} {{benefits}} <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{of community and}} socialising. Stokvel members traditionally meet regularly and make an occasion of the meetings.|$|R

60|$|He stopped, for, {{in spite}} of his efforts to be brotherly, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of sinking at his heart which {{slightly}} embittered his tone.|$|R
25|$|Lyrical {{abstraction}} shares similarities {{with color}} field painting and abstract expressionism {{especially in the}} freewheeling usage of paint — texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in abstract expressionism and color field painting. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from abstract expressionism and action painting of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in lyrical abstraction there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.|$|E
25|$|The pair were {{nominated}} for the Turner Prize in 1999, cited for their exhibition, Gamma at the Lisson Gallery in London. On the run up to the Turner Prize winner announcement, they also had a solo exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London (1999). Art works that were exhibited included Stasi City, Parliament (A Third House), and Gamma, a multiscreen video installation that was filmed at the former US military base at Greenham Common in Berkshire. This site was used to house nuclear cruise missiles during the Cold War and decommissioned in 1992. The Wilsons' video moves through the deserted institution, where nothing is now happening, evoking disturbing memories and possibilities. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of unease and threat, implied but never realised. They are the only characters in the film, appearing in military-style skirts and polished black shoes.|$|E

60|$|It was {{all very}} {{pleasant}} and genuine; there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of ease and peacefulness, {{quite different from the}} mechanical, slightly sullen manoeuvring of the Germans.|$|R
60|$|It was by {{no means}} naïve {{simplicity}} which inspired Caroline's next remark; it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of antipathy to such opinions, and of displeasure at him who held them.|$|R
25|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{of irony}} to CBS' {{coverage}} of the assassination. On September 2, 1963, Kennedy gave an interview with Cronkite, helping CBS inaugurate network television's first half hour evening newscast.|$|R
25|$|In Livy’s account there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{that the}} peace with the Samnites {{had been on a}} thin edge for years. It has also to be noted that Cales was in an {{important}} strategic position not only for the route from Rome to Capua but also for some of the routes which gave access to the mountains of Samnium. Yet the Samnites had not responded militarily to Roman interventions in Campania. One factor might have been the conflict between the Lucanians (the Samnites’ southerly neighbours) and the Greek city of Taras (Tarentum in Latin, modern Taranto) on the Ionian Sea. The Tarentines called for the help of the Greek king Alexander of Epirus, who crossed over to Italy in 334 BC. In 332 BC Alexander landed at Paestum, which was close to Samnium and Campania. The Samnites joined the Lucanians and the two were defeated by Alexander, who then established friendly relations with Rome. However, Alexander was killed in battle in 331 or 330 BC. The grievance of the Samnites about Fregellae might have been an addition to aggravations caused by Roman policy in Campania in the previous eight years.|$|E
25|$|Chimnabai I was {{knowledgeable}} in Bharatanatyam and Carnatic music, {{and brought}} a troupe with her comprising two dancers, two nattuvanars (leaders of Bharatanatyam concerts) and two teachers (Khandwani 2002). Others followed later, including Nattuvanar Appaswamy and his dancer wife Kantimati, who had studied with Kannusamy and Vadively, {{two members of the}} Tanjore Quartet. After the death of Appaswamy in 1939, Kantimati and their son, Guru Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar, left Baroda to teach in Lucknow, and then worked in the film industry in South India until Sayajirao's successor, Pratapsinhrao Gaekwad recalled the family to Baroda in 1949 to teach in the Music Department in the Kalavan Palace, later absorbed into the Maharaja Sayajirao University (Gaston 1996: 158-160). Later Guruvarya Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar established his own Institute, the Tanjore Dance Music & Art Research Centre at Baroda with his son Guru Shri Ramesh Tanjorkar and Guru Smt. Leela R. Tanjorkar (Kubernath Tanjorkar's family is devoted to Bharatnatyam dance now including their grandsons Rajesh and Ashish). So {{what we have here is}} a tradition of very distinguished Bharatanatyam dancers and teachers, members of a family considered an offshoot of the Tanjore Quartet bani (stylistic schools; Gaston 1996: 159), already established in Gujarat by the time Mrinalini set up her own academy. Yet there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> that what she did was not new.|$|E
500|$|Steve Redgrave, {{vice-president}} of the BOA, added [...] "I don't think there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of disappointmentI think there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of celebration of winning that gold medal. I would take one gold medal over five bronze medals any day." [...] Hunt also {{announced that the}} BOA would conduct a strategic review of funding and may support the channeling of more funds towards realistic medal hopes.|$|E
50|$|The {{result can}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of grandiosity {{based on the}} {{internalisation}} of the parental value systems, an acceptance of the inner critic with its automatic thoughts {{as a substitute for}} real relating.|$|R
50|$|Template metaprogramming <b>was,</b> in <b>a</b> <b>sense,</b> {{discovered}} accidentally.|$|R
60|$|Violet blushed excessively, {{and made}} some inarticulate disavowals. She felt it {{presumption}} to let her name be coupled with Miss Martindale's, and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of something dangerous and wrong in expecting admiration.|$|R
500|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{in which}} some {{multiples}} of 2 are [...] "more even" [...] than others. Multiples of 4 are called doubly even, since they can be divided by 2 twice. Not only is zero divisible by 4, zero has the unique property of being divisible by every power of 2, so it surpasses all other numbers in [...] "evenness".|$|E
500|$|Adults are not {{the stars}} or main {{characters}} of the film, and Roz Kaveney notes that what [...] "Ferris Bueller brings to the teen genre, ultimately, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of {{how it is possible}} to be cool and popular without being rich or a sports hero. Unlike the heroes of Weird Science, Ferris is computer savvy without being a nerd or a geek — it is a skill he has taken the trouble to learn." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ears are}} small, sparsely covered in hair, and {{hidden in the}} fur. [...] Similar to the slender lorises, the fur around and {{directly}} above the eyes is dark. [...] Unlike the slender lorises, however, the white stripe that separates the eye rings broadens both {{on the tip of}} the nose and on the forehead while also fading out on the forehead. [...] Like other strepsirrhine primates, the nose and lip are covered by a moist skin called the rhinarium ("wet nose"), which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> organ.|$|E
50|$|There {{were several}} reasons for the low number of electoral contests. One issue <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of {{political}} apathy, whilst the other was that the immense costs of standing for election dissuaded individuals from standing.|$|R
50|$|Tryptophol <b>is</b> <b>a</b> quorum <b>sensing</b> {{molecule}} for {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It {{is also found}} in the bloodstream of patients with chronic trypanosomiasis. For that reason, it may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> quorum <b>sensing</b> molecule for the trypanosome parasite.|$|R
50|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{of mission}} and {{excitement}} at the Mint, {{and it was}} the same thing here at the Institute. We were banded together by a common purpose—and by the sheer terror of it all.|$|R
