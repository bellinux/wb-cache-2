50|$|Tracking {{can also}} cause shading problems. As <b>the</b> panels move <b>during</b> <b>the</b> course of the day, it is {{possible}} that, if the panels are located too close to one another, they may shade one another due to profile angle effects. As an example, if you have several panels in a row from east to west, {{there will be no}} shading during solar noon. But in the afternoon, panels could be shaded by their west neighboring panel if they are sufficiently close. This means that panels must be spaced sufficiently far to prevent shading in systems with tracking, which can reduce the available power from a given area <b>during</b> <b>the</b> peak <b>Sun</b> <b>hours.</b> This is not a big problem if there is sufficient land area to widely space the panels. But it will reduce output during certain hours of the day (i.e. around solar noon) compared to a fixed array.|$|R
