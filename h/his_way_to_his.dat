5|$|President Garfield {{came to the}} Sixth Street Station on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> alma mater, Williams College, {{where he}} was {{scheduled}} to deliver a speech. Garfield was accompanied by two of his sons, James and Harry, and Secretary of State Blaine. Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln waited at the station to see the President off. Garfield had no bodyguard or security detail; with the exception of Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, early U.S. presidents never used any guards.|$|E
5|$|Bok asked a {{man with}} a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari. The man, a Muslim named Abdah, agreed to help him. Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to {{transport}} Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein {{in the back of his}} truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. When he could not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum, Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok. Francis Bok arrived in Khartoum with no money, no place to go, and did not know where to turn. Fortunately for Francis, another stranger helped him find <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> fellow Dinka tribespeople in Khartoum in the Jabarona settlement.|$|E
5|$|Now a Crown property, Dunstaffnage was {{controlled}} {{by a series of}} keepers. James I seized the castle in 1431, following the Battle of Inverlochy, as his enemies were hiding inside. In 1455 James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas stayed at Dunstaffnage, on his way to treat with John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles. This followed James II's attack on Douglas power, and led to the signing of the Treaty of Westminster-Ardtornish. A later keeper, John Stewart of Lorn, was a rival of Alan MacDougall, and was stabbed by his supporters on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> marriage at Dunstaffnage Chapel in 1463, although he survived long enough to make his vows. Although MacDougall took the castle, he was ousted by James III, who granted Dunstaffnage to Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll in 1470.|$|E

5|$|Twelve-year-old Keith Bennett {{vanished}} on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> grandmother's {{house in}} Longsight, Manchester, {{early in the}} evening of 16 June 1964, four days after his birthday. Hindley lured him into her Mini Pick-up—which Brady was sitting in the back of—by asking for the boy's help in loading some boxes, after which she said she would drive him home. She drove to a lay-by on Saddleworth Moor as she and Brady had previously arranged, and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove. Hindley kept watch, and after about 30minutes or so Brady reappeared, alone and carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier. When Hindley asked how he had killed Bennett, Brady said that he had sexually assaulted the boy and strangled him with a piece of string.|$|E
5|$|When the Germans {{launched}} {{the invasion of}} Crete on 20 May, Kippenberger, {{like most of the}} defenders of the island, was surprised at the sight of hundreds of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) descending under parachutes. He quickly recovered and was making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> headquarters, when a burst of gunfire from a paratrooper was directed his way. After twisting his ankle in avoiding the gunfire, he stalked and killed the paratrooper with a shot to the head. His brigade was positioned east of Maleme airfield, on the Galatas plains. It was well positioned to counterattack scattered paratroopers who were beginning to consolidate into a good starting position from which an attack on the airfield could be launched. His request to do so was denied by the acting divisional commander, Brigadier Edward Puttick. An attack launched later without Kippenberger's knowledge failed although he believed the outcome could have been different if his troops had been involved.|$|E

On February 16, Harris posted a new career high 46 points along with 9 rebounds, 6 assists and 4 steals against the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. This is a Charge record for the franchise since its move to Canton. In the rematch two nights later, he added 36 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists and 3 steals. He became {{the first player to}} earn two player of the week awards in the 201112 season when the league recognized him for his performance for the week of February 1319. In 17 games for Canton, he had averages of 21.4 points, 7.9 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.6 blocks per game, while shooting 47% from the field and 40.9% on three-point shots. On February 21, the Cleveland Cavaliers announced they had signed Harris to a 10-day contract. He was re-signed on March 2 to a second 10-day contract.

25|$|Manufacturing {{and retail}} {{remained}} Wilkes-Barre's strongest industries, but the city's economy took a major blow from Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972.

A total of 128 deaths were attributed to the storm, the majority of drowning deaths were caused by people trapped in their cars; almost 400,000 homes and businesses were destroyed; 220,000 Pennsylvanians were left homeless (as were hundreds of thousands in other states). Damages were estimated to be $2.1 billion in Pennsylvania alone.
