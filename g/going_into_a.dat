5|$|However, Osborn had {{no control}} over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would {{automatically}} absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, even if he did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him <b>going</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> coma. After he regained consciousness, these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead.|$|E

Ridden by Tommy Loates, Ladas started at odds of 10/11 (0.9/1) in a field of eight, with Matchbox (ridden by Watts) the second choice on 2/1 and the filly Throstle ignored on 50/1. As usual, Ladas was held up {{at the back of the}} field as, at first Throstle, then a horse named Legal Tender, then Matchbox made the running. Ladas moved {{steadily}} closer and turned into the straight in second, before overtaking Matchbox and <b>going</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> clear lead. In the final furlong, however, he was challenged by Throstle, and in the closing stages the latter pulled ahead to win by three quarters of a length. According to The Sportsman, the cheers of the crowd were replaced by those of the bookmakers as the outsider overhauled the favourite.|$|E

Lauren goes back with her to her bedsit, but Whitney does not want to go, saying she and Rob are in love. Lauren is then thrown out by Rob.
