5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E

500|$|Rhimes {{felt that}} the 100th episode showed well Meredith's {{evolution}} throughout the show from a [...] "dark and twisty girl" [...] to a [...] "happy woman". She said: [...] "She <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> her mother wished for her. She is extraordinary. Because, {{to get past the}} crap of your past? To move on? To let the past go and change? That is extraordinary. To love? Without fear? Without screwing it up? That is extraordinary. It makes me happy to see her happy." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{was astounded}} by the series' size and success. As {{they began to}} read, the duo noticed {{that it had a}} {{tendency}} to take [...] "readers on a lot of side trips"—"from detailed explanations of surveillance techniques to angry attacks on corrupt Swedish industrialists," [...] professed The Hollywood Reporter Gregg Kilday. Fincher recalled of the encounter: [...] "The ballistic, ripping-yarn thriller aspect of it is kind of a red herring in a weird way. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that throws Salander and Blomkvist together, but it is their relationship you keep coming back to. I was just wondering what 350 pages Zaillian would get rid of." [...] Because Zaillian was already cultivating the screenplay, the director avoided interfering. After a conversation, Fincher was comfortable [...] "they were headed in the same direction".|$|E

In Laing's interpretation, the entities [...] "me" [...] and [...] "my mind" [...] represent, respectively, [...] "individualistic, selfish ego" [...] and [...] "the Buddhist not-self, freed from the anxieties of historical Time". In I, Me, Mine, however, Harrison states that, with hindsight, the order of [...] "me" [...] and [...] "my mind" [...] should be reversed, since: [...] "The mind <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that hops about telling us to do this and do that – when what we need is to lose (forget) the mind." ...|$|E

500|$|Also at WonderCon, {{a poster}} {{based on the}} season was made available, with art by Mike McKone. It {{features}} Johnson, her pose an homage to a well-known Secret Warriors cover depicting the comic version of the character, with other main characters paired behind her (Coulson and Price, the latter because [...] "she really {{was a big part}} of the first half of the season and...her death <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> [...] drives Coulson", according to Bell; Fitz and Simmons; Hunter and Morse; May and Garner / Lash; and Mack and Elena Rodriguez). Lincoln is featured on his own, so as not to [...] "take a super strong female character [...] and reduce her to being a part of a relationship where she won't be fulfilled until she finds her man", as are Ward / Hive and Malick, the latter with the symbol of the former upon him: [...] "We have told you who Ward's become, and Hive is the person that Malick is really in a relationship with. So the fact that reflection is on him or in him or around him is pretty potent," [...] explained Bell.|$|E
500|$|Comedy Central {{originally}} ordered {{only six}} episodes of South Park {{for the first}} season's initial run. However, when the show {{proved to be a}} success, they requested an additional seven, the first ones of which creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had to produce quickly. [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first of those new seven episodes to be produced. It was also the first South Park Halloween episode. The script was written by Parker, Stone and writer Philip Stark, and was directed by Parker and Stone, who made the pinkeye a major element of the plot because they associate the illness with the elementary school experience. Parker said, [...] "Pinkeye is just such a huge part of your life when you're in third grade. Pinkeye <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> every third grader gets and it's just such a bizarre thing." [...] In writing the episode, Parker said he wanted to convey his belief that Halloween is a positive holiday, especially for children: [...] "Halloween's a great thing. That was part of what we wanted (to say). I think kids having this kind of mythology is great." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series creator Rob Thomas, marking his seventh writing credit and second and final directing credit for the series (after [...] "Donut Run"). Starting with this episode, Thomas and the crew's plan for the season changed—while they had initially scheduled three major story arcs for the season, this number was now bumped down to two, while the last few episodes would be standalone. The creative team decided that their choices for major mysteries had not worked since season one; Thomas elaborated, [...] "One feeling is that the big mysteries keep away the casual TV viewers, and the other <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that has been the least successful since season one [...] the big mysteries." [...] Thomas also recalled that his major design for the first season that was because Lilly had been murdered, everyone had a stake in the solving of the mystery and that the crew were finding it impossible to keep the same amount of emotional involvement since the first season; Thomas thought that the new format would be a way of trying to return to a more emotionally driven format.|$|E

500|$|Regarding the {{resolution}} of the character at season four and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast, Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season, and [...] "it was time to end the character's story". But, they changed his original [...] "violent, morbid" [...] sendoff to a relatively happy one, citing their likability of actor and character as the reason. Also it was [...] "nice to give someone a happy ending for once." [...] Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff, particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted: [...] That to me is the soul of the character. The name of the show is Angel so it all comes back to him. For Connor, everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz, and when we got the opportunity for him to let that out, I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity. He showed that he was hurt by his father and that he was hurt by Holtz. The last scene of Angel watching memory-wiped Connor dine with his new family and slipping away quietly was Whedon's idea, derived from 1937's classic movie Stella Dallas: [...] "I've given up my child. I see my child is happy, and does not know me, and I'm happy. That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that made Stella Darlas the greatest, the thing that made this episode work." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the medieval}} Islamic world, the scholar al-Jāḥiẓ (776 – c. 868) wrote his Book of Animals in the 9th century. Conway Zirkle, {{writing about the}} history of natural {{selection}} in 1941, said that an excerpt from this work was the only relevant passage he had found from an Arabian scholar. He provided a quotation describing the struggle for existence, citing a Spanish translation of this work: [...] "The rat goes out for its food, and is clever in getting it, for it eats all animals inferior to it in strength," [...] and in turn, it [...] "has to avoid snakes and birds and serpents of prey, who look for it in order to devour it" [...] and are stronger than the rat. Mosquitoes [...] "know instinctively that blood <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> which makes them live" [...] and when they see an animal, [...] "they know that the skin has been fashioned to serve them as food." [...] In turn, flies hunt the mosquito [...] "which is the food that they like best," [...] and predators eat the flies. [...] "All animals, in short, can not exist without food, neither can the hunting animal escape being hunted in his turn. Every weak animal devours those weaker than itself. Strong animals cannot escape being devoured by other animals stronger than they. And in this respect, men do not differ from animals, some with respect to others, although they do not arrive at the same extremes. In short, God has disposed some human beings as a cause of life for others, and likewise, he has disposed the latter as a cause of the death of the former." [...] Al-Jāḥiẓ also wrote descriptions of food chains.|$|E

It's like when Paul said, 'The things I want to do <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I don't do, and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I don't want to do <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that I do.'" ...|$|R

2500|$|As {{the habit}} is forming, {{it can be}} {{analysed}} in three parts: the cue, the behavior, and the reward.

This could be anything that one's mind associates with that habit and one will automatically let a habit come to the surface. The behavior is the actual habit that one exhibits, and the reward, a positive feeling, therefore continues the [...] "habit loop". A habit may initially be triggered by a goal, but over time that goal becomes less necessary and the habit becomes more automatic.|$|E

[...] Rolling Stone responded favorably to the record, noting that the song marries her heartbreak anthems with a radio-friendly sound [...] "with banjos flying, strings swelling and guitars wailing, Swift keeps her lyrics simple but effective" [...] The Pop Fairy gave a negative review: [...] "“Red” is (...) another love song by America’s favorite cougar of the moment.
