50|$|<b>Friction</b> <b>tape</b> {{is a type}} of {{adhesive}} tape made from cloth impregnated with a rubber-based adhesive, mainly used to insulate splices in electric wires and cables.

In the past, <b>friction</b> <b>tape</b> was widely used by electricians, but PVC electrical tape has replaced it in most applications today. The frictional properties of the tape come from the cloth material, which is usually made from cotton, while the fabric base protects electrical splices against punctures and abrasion.|$|E

40|$|The {{reduction}} of lateral tape motion (LTM) in tape drives {{is a key}} requirement for improved performance of tape drives since read/write errors are likely to occur if lateral tape motion exceeds {{ten percent of the}} track width of the recorded magnetic signal. Lateral tape motion is a function of tape path and tape properties, mechanical design parameters such as speed and tension, and <b>friction</b> between <b>tape</b> and tape path components. This investigation deals with the effect of friction on LTM for a tape moving over the surface of a cylindrical guide. The effect of friction and mechanical design parameters on LTM is investigated numerically. The equation of motion for a moving tape on a cylindrical guide surface is determined and the effects of friction and design parameters are examined by calculating the ratio of LTM before and after a cylindrical guide. Keeping the tape velocity and guide radius constant, attenuation of the LTM signal is seen to occur for all frequency components of the signal. Attenuation of LTM is found to increase with increasing friction and roller radius. Increasing tape tension reduces LTM while keeping the friction coefficient constant. 1...|$|R

50|$|Knob-and-tube wiring (sometimes {{abbreviated}} K&T) is {{an early}} standardized method of electrical wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s. It consisted of single-insulated copper conductors run within wall or ceiling cavities, passing through joist and stud drill-holes via protective porcelain insulating tubes, and supported along their length on nailed-down porcelain knob insulators. Where conductors entered a wiring device such as a lamp or switch, or were pulled into a wall, they were protected by flexible cloth insulating sleeving called loom. The first insulation was asphalt-saturated cotton cloth, then rubber became common. Wire splices in such installations were twisted together for good mechanical strength, then soldered and wrapped with rubber insulating tape and <b>friction</b> <b>tape</b> (asphalt saturated cloth), or made inside metal junction boxes.|$|E

40|$|Magnetic {{tape storage}} which is {{primarily}} used for long-term archival and backup of digital data, {{has historically been}} the most efficient, high-capacity and least expensive storage technology for huge quantities of data. Tape storage applications are in diverse fields such as corporate and government financial records, satellite imagery, credit card databases and patient medical records. Recently, the Linear Tape-Open (LTO) Ultrium format {{has emerged as the}} most dominant tape technology option in the mid-range tape drive market, with the LTO generation 5 (LTO- 5) being capable of holding as much as 1. 5 TB of uncompressed data on a single cartridge. Tape storage however has been traditionally challenged by competing technologies like hard disk drives (HDD), consumer optical storage devices which include CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray disk technologies, optical library systems and holographic storage systems. Thus, one of main goals of the tape industry is to design and manufacture advanced tape storage technologies that aim at reducing the price per unit data storage (/GB). In commercial tape drives, a flexible magnetic tape is transported between the supply and take-up packs at a fixed axial tension and transport speed and over edge and surface guides and read/write heads. The tape decks must assure accurate guiding and transport of the tape while it accelerates and decelerates by holding the axial tension constant. During transport, lateral in-plane vibration of tape 2 ̆ 7 s narrow edge causes misalignment between data tracks on the tape and position of read/write head and leads to reduced storage capacity. Lateral vibration (low and high frequency) is caused by excitation sources viz. pack run-out, flange impacts, pack tilts and tape edge weave. High frequency lateral vibration is more detrimental as it is difficult to move the read/write head to follow the tape 2 ̆ 7 s high frequency motion. To attenuate this vibration, surface guides (rollers or stationary guides) which control the lateral displacement of <b>tape</b> by applying <b>friction</b> on its wider surface, are used. Choice of an appropriate surface guide (or roller) is possible with an understanding of the physics involved in the surface <b>friction</b> between magnetic <b>tape</b> 2 ̆ 7 s wide surface and the roller. This thesis is motivated by the need to conduct a detailed investigation into the frictional interaction between roller surface and magnetic tape and contribute towards the advancement of tape technology to meet the growing market needs. A parametric study is carried out with respect to the tape 2 ̆ 7 s axial tension and axial velocity in the following two aspects: *	An experimental setup is used to control these tape parameters and obtain lateral vibration measurements at two points equidistant from the tape-roller interface to understand the effect of stick-slip friction at the interface on tape 2 ̆ 7 s lateral vibration *	A numerical model is developed to study stick-slip friction between the roller surface and the tape that travels over it. The tape is modeled as an axially moving, tensioned, viscoelastic Euler-Bernoulli beam subjected to boundary disturbances arising from supply and take-up pack run-out and stick-slip <b>friction</b> between <b>tape</b> and roller surface. These analyses are used to predict the possibility of sticking or slipping between the surfaces in contact, as a function of parameters viz. axial tension, axial velocity, surface roughness of roller and span length. A `dynamic phase diagram 2 ̆ 7 is constructed to determine the regions in the stiffness-velocity phase-space where steady stick-slip motion occurs and its effects on lateral vibration of the magnetic tape...|$|R
30|$|The {{difference}} in mode of catastrophic failure is also noteworthy. The ST/G reconstructions characteristically failed when the graft slipped around the interference screw; i.e., both the static friction along the graft–tunnel interface and the anchoring with the interference screw failed {{to counter the}} tension load. The majority of Quad ST-tape constructs failed when the knotted tape slipped around the screw into the cancellous bone. The interference screws used had a different design from other reports for a partial inside-out technique tape fixation technique, which may {{have resulted in the}} heterogeneous fixation results in our study. Full-length tunnels were used to mimic an ACLR technique using fixed suspensory loop femoral fixation with tibial tape–screw fixation. If our tunnels had been drilled partial length inside-out, our results may have been different; however, given that the majority of Quad ST-tape failures were due to graft slippage around the screw, despite the tape being tied over the screw head, it remains uncertain if the graft slippage still would not have occurred. If the tunnels had been drilled partial length inside-out so that an isthmus of bone remained at the screw tip, this may have provided additional <b>friction</b> to the <b>tape.</b> However, as noted above, we attempted to add to the tape–screw fixation by tying a knot over the screw in compensation for the full-length tunnel.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic tape is a {{flexible}} mechanical structure having dimensions that areorders of magnitude different in its thickness, width, and length directions. In order {{to position the}} tape relative to the read/write head, guides constrain the tape 2 ̆ 7 s lateral motion, but even the modest forces that develop during guiding can cause wear and damage to the tape 2 ̆ 7 s edges. This paper presents antensioned axially-moving viscoelastic Euler–Bernoulli beam model used to simulate thentape 2 ̆ 7 s lateral dynamics, the guiding forces, and the position errornbetween the data tracks and the read/write head. Lateral vibration can be excited by disturbances {{in the form of}} pack runout, flange impacts, precurvature of the tape in its natural unstressed state, and spiral stacking as tape winds onto the take-up pack. The guide model incorporates nonlinear characteristics including preload and deadbands in displacement and restoring force. A tracking servo model represents the ability of the read/write head 2 ̆ 7 s actuator to track disturbances in the tape 2 ̆ 7 s motion, and the actuator 2 ̆ 7 s motion couples through <b>friction</b> with the <b>tape</b> 2 ̆ 7 s vibration. Low frequency excitation arising from pack runout can excite high frequency position error because of the nonlinear characteristics of the guides and impacts against the pack 2 ̆ 7 s flanges.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} three {{series of}} tests that were designed to investigate how skin mechanical and structural properties, measured using a ‘Cutometer’ and optical coherence tomography, affect the frictional behaviour of human finger-pads. First, the skin mechanical properties across all fingers and the palm in participants’ dominant hands were assessed. Results showed that the distensibility of skin (total deformation in a suction test) is associated with stratum corneum thickness and that this in turn affects friction (thicker stratum corneum leads to higher friction), giving a link between distensibility and <b>friction.</b> <b>Tape</b> stripping to remove the superficial layer of the skin led to increased moisture (and/or electric charge on the skin surface) that led to higher friction. No accompanying changes were seen in structural properties, so {{it was concluded that}} moisture was the main cause of the adhesion increase. More work is required to isolate moisture and possible changes in electric charge using alternative measurement techniques. When rubbing with sand-paper, the stratum corneum thinned considerably and friction reduced. Moisture was ruled out as a cause of friction changes in this instance. Skin normal stiffness also did not change, but lateral stiffness changes have been seen in previous work when the stratum corneum thickness has been reduced, so this {{is likely to be the}} cause of the reduced friction. This will be investigated further in future work using dynamic optical coherence tomography measurements...|$|E

A good quality stylus, matched with a correctly set up pick-up arm, should cause minimal surface wear. Magnetic tapes, both analog and digital, wear from <b>friction</b> between the <b>tape</b> and the heads, guides, {{and other parts of the}} tape transport as the tape slides over them. The brown residue deposited on swabs during cleaning of a tape machine's tape path is actually particles of magnetic coating shed from tapes. Tapes can also suffer creasing, stretching, and frilling of the edges of the plastic tape base, particularly from low-quality or out-of-alignment tape decks. When a CD is played, there is no physical contact involved, and the data is read optically using a laser beam. Therefore, no such media deterioration takes place, and the CD will, with proper care, sound exactly the same every time it is played (discounting aging of the player and CD itself); however, this is a benefit of the optical system, not of digital recording, and the Laserdisc format enjoys the same non-contact benefit with analog optical signals. Recordable CDs slowly degrade with time, called disc rot, even if they are not played, and are stored properly. [...] A new compact disc was released called M-DISC which is said to last 1000 years.

Tape - velocity variation is typically ± 10 % of standard speed over tape lengths of 5 µm. with occasional variations of ± 40 %. Static tape - skew can result due to axial movement of the tape reel when it spools. Dynamic tape skew occurs and is primarily caused by tape - edge curvature with a constant contribution due to the transport mechanism. Spectral skew components range from 0. 32 Hz to 8 Hz with magnitude normally within one 10 kbit/ sec- bit cell. The pinch roller works against the <b>friction</b> of the <b>tape</b> guides to cause tape deformation. Average values of tape deformation are 0. 67 µm, 0. 85 µm and 1. 08 µm for C 60,C 90 and C 120 tape respectively. Parallel,software encoding / decoding algorithms {{have been developed for}} several channel codes. Adaptive software methods permit track data rates up to 3. 33 k bits/sec in a rnultitrack system using a simple microcomputer. For a 4 - track system,raw error rates vary from 10 ˉ⁷ at 500 bits/sec/track to 10 ˉ⁵ at 3. 33 kbits/sec/track. Adaptive software reduces skew - induced errors by 50 %. A skew - correction technique has been developed and implemented on an 8 - track system at a track data rate of 10 k bits/sec. Real - time error correction gives a theoretical corrected error rate of 10 ˉ¹¹for a raw error rate of 10 ˉ⁷. Multiple track errors can cause mis - correction and interleaving is advised.

40|$|In his MIT Doctoral {{thesis on}} an {{inverted}} Hydride-fueled reactor concept, Paolo Ferroni (2010) suggested using short-length twisted tape inserts {{in order to}} increase the critical heat flux (CHF) at which departure from nucleate boiling occurs. Shortlength twisted tapes were proposed in his study because they offer the benefits of increased heat transfer and CHF, but also introduce a smaller pressure drop than a full-length twisted tape insert. This thesis project investigated the effects of short-length twisted tape inserts on the pressure drop in round tubes. The objectives of the project were two-fold. The first objective was to characterize the development of swirl flow in sequential twisted tapes. The second objective was to create a correlation for the Darcy's friction factor {{as a function of the}} Reynolds number (Re), tape twist ratio (y), and tape spacing (s) which could be used for both Ferroni's work and other future work. To characterize developing flow, 6 test sections were constructed. Measurements were collected for the pressure drop at several sequential twisted tapes, and the resulting friction factors were compared for each tape module. The results showed at most ± 10 % difference in <b>friction</b> factor between <b>tapes</b> and no significant trends between friction factor and the axial sequence location (or index) of the tape. To develop a correlation, 21 test sections were constructed by P. Ferroni and the author.
