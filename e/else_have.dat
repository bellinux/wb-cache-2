25|$|The female lays {{her eggs}} {{as close to}} the food source as possible, and {{development}} is very rapid, allowing the larva to consume as much food as possible {{in a short period of}} time before transforming into the adult. The eggs hatch immediately after being laid, or the flies are ovoviviparous, with the larva hatching inside the mother. Larval flies, or maggots, have no true legs, and little demarcation between the thorax and abdomen; in the more derived species, the head is not clearly distinguishable from the rest of the body. Maggots are limbless, or <b>else</b> <b>have</b> small prolegs. The eyes and antennae are reduced or absent, and the abdomen also lacks appendages such as cerci. This lack of features is an adaptation to a food-rich environment, such as within rotting organic matter, or as an endoparasite. The pupae take various forms, and in some cases develop inside a silk cocoon. After emerging from the pupa, the adult fly rarely lives more than a few days, and serves mainly to reproduce and to disperse in search of new food sources.|$|E

I remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager, Ann, and I was like, 'Do not let anyone <b>else</b> <b>have</b> this song! It’s my song.' In talking to Chris and Josh about it, they , 'We said we're either writing a song for Carrie Underwood or this song {{is never going to}} see the light of day.' It made me feel so good that they were thinking of me when they wrote it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "This Is England", {{much like}} the rest of the album that came out later that year, had been {{drastically}} re-engineered by Rhodes, with synths and football-style chants added to Strummer's incomplete recordings. Although Howard was an adept drummer, drum machines were used for virtually all of the percussion tracks. For the remainder of his life, Strummer largely disowned the album, although he did profess that [...] "I really like 'This Is England' [...] 'North and South' is a vibe." [...] In early 1986, the Clash disbanded. Strummer later described the group's end: [...] "When the Clash collapsed, we were tired. There had been a lot of intense activity in five years. Secondly, I felt we'd run out of idea gasoline. And thirdly, I wanted to shut up and let someone <b>else</b> <b>have</b> a go at it." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and contributed to}} the film's success. Film historian and columnist Randor Guy approved of the music, considering [...] "Ninaipadhellam" [...] to have [...] "excellent background orchestration". Film critic Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The New Indian Express, opined that [...] "Engirundhaalum Vaazhga" [...] had set [...] "the precedent for several generations of jilted lovers". On [...] "Sonnathu Neethaana", singer Charulatha Mani wrote, [...] "The subtle pathos that P. Susheela imparts when she sings 'sol sol..en uyire' is notable." [...] P. K. Ajith Kumar of The Hindu stated, [...] "Just as [...] does not need to know the language to sing a song perfectly, we need not know Tamil to enjoy her songs like ... Sonnathu neethanaa... Nenjil Oru Aalayam [...] )". Rajadhyaksha and Willemen called [...] "Engirundhaalum Vaazhga" [...] "a classic number about unrequited love." [...] Following Viswanathan's death in July 2015, the news agency, Press Trust of India wrote that [...] "Ninaipadhellam" [...] was [...] "memorable for the deep sense of solace it offered to wounded hearts." [...] Anand Venkateswaran of The Wire noted, [...] "MSV’s style is less about making words sit in a meter than about a musical empathy with the meaning. Could anyone <b>else</b> <b>have</b> set to tune the first line of ‘Sonnadhu nee daana‘, of Nenjil Or Alayam (Muthuraman, 1962)?" [...] A critic from Dina Thanthi noted Kannadasan had an uncanny ability to deliver perfect situational songs and cited [...] "Sonnathu Neethaana" [...] as an example.|$|E
500|$|Childhood friends, Donnel Carty, 18, and Delano Brown, 17, {{had earlier}} that evening robbed chef Kurshid Ali, {{a middle-aged man}} in Kensal Green station, 20 minutes before Pryce arrived at the station {{on his way home}} from work. Pryce was walking from Kensal Green Tube station at about 2300 to 2330 GMT, when he was attacked. According to witness reports, Pryce was running along Bathurst Gardens from two black youths. According to {{testimony}} from Delano Brown, Donnel Carty stabbed Pryce after they had chased him from Kensal Green Tube station where police found a trail of blood and belongings, including a pair of gloves and papers regarding Pryce's wedding arrangements. As the youths chased Pryce, Carty [...] "fly-kicked" [...] him in the back and he dropped to the floor. As Pryce attempted to stand up, Carty kicked him in the face. Trying to get away, Pryce began to fight Carty, as Carty stopped him. Some time during this Pryce was stabbed twice in the chest and once in the hip, the wounds penetrating vital organs including his heart. He also suffered cuts to his head, hands and torso. As Pryce's belongings lay scattered around him, Carty and Brown took Pryce's mobile phone and Oyster card, the only possessions of value Pryce was carrying. Carty then shouted 'What <b>else</b> <b>have</b> you got?' to which Pryce responded 'Nothing. You have got everything'. Carty and Brown then ran off towards Clifford Gardens, heading to Carty's home leaving Pryce dying on the ground. Pryce was later taken to Central Middlesex Hospital, where he was confirmed dead shortly after midnight.|$|E

2500|$|When {{formulated}} {{with slightly}} more clarity the argument states that all investors will, over time, tend toward the average. According to Pilkington this claim is less tautological than {{the claim that}} the average investor will not beat the market average but has nevertheless been implicitly constructed in a similar manner. In order to show this he cites the fact that EMH proponents will label anyone who beats the market {{over a period of time}} [...] "lucky". But Pilkington points out that neither the EMH proponents nor anyone <b>else</b> <b>have</b> any criteria by which to distinguish luck from skill.|$|E
2500|$|In Romanesque {{domestic}} architecture, arcades {{were most}} often supported on piers. They were built of masonry and are of square or rectangular section, generally having a horizontal moulding representing a capital at the springing of the arch. Columns {{were also used}} to support arcades and vaults, but are a feature of palace, civic and monastic architecture, rather than smaller houses. Colonnettes and attached shafts are also used structurally and for decoration. The capital {{on top of a}} column is usually cut so that it is round at the bottom, where it sits on the column, and square at the top where it support the arch. A capital might be undecorated, or <b>else</b> <b>have</b> foliate or figurative carving.|$|E
2500|$|Talbot's mode of chivalry is {{replaced}} by politicians concerned only with themselves and their own advancement: Winchester, Somerset, Suffolk, even Richard. As Jane Howell, director of the BBC Shakespeare adaptation argues, [...] "what I was concerned about in the first play [...] was {{that for a long}} time, the code of the people had been chivalry. But with the death of Talbot, one starts to see a demise of chivalry." [...] Narcissistic political infighting has supplanted self-sacrificing patriotism and chivalry: [...] "the play charts the disastrous breakdown of civility among the English nobility." [...] Nobles concerned with personal power above all <b>else</b> <b>have</b> replaced knights concerned only with the empire. As such, {{by the end of the}} play, both Talbot and his son lay dead, as does the notion of English chivalry. In this sense then, the play [...] "depicts the deaths of the titanic survivors of an ancien régime." ...|$|E

2500|$|Within the Lifehold, BLADE discovers a pool {{of genetic}} {{material}} {{which can be used}} to recreate Earth lifeforms and restore humanity, and Elma explains that none of their human bodies are actually kept in stasis and were destroyed with Earth, but that their memories, and thus, their consciousnesses, are kept in the Lifehold's powerful computers, and {{that it is possible to}} transfer their consciousnesses into their new bodies. As the ethics are highly questionable, this decision was made through the tough choices of their superiors. Luxaar attacks, but Lao fatally stabs him. Luxaar then accidentally merges with Lao in the genetic material, with BLADE being forced to kill their merged form. Before dying, Lao reveals that humanity's DNA was designed by their Samaarian ancestors to destroy the Ganglion using an in-built genetic failsafe. Though Lao dies, Elma assures the group that he can be revived using the Lifehold. With the Lifehold online and power restored, Elma deactivates her Mimeosome and reveals her true form as an alien. A narration by Lin reveals that Elma visited Earth thirty years before the aliens arrived, giving humanity the means of escaping. In a post-credits scene, a team led by Elma enter the Lifehold to find that the databases containing the memories of everyone <b>else</b> <b>have</b> been destroyed since the White Whale crashed on Mira. As everyone else should have died when the databases were destroyed, Elma speculates that somehow, Mira is preserving them. Lao is then seen unconscious on a beach, waking when approached by a cloaked figure. The game ends with the message [...] "This story never truly ends...".|$|E
