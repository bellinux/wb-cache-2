Dr. Killjoy (voiced by John Armstrong) was a psychiatrist/surgeon who ran an insane asylum on the island in the 1920s.

Haight (John Patrick Lowrie) was the executioner in Abbot for twenty-seven years, before he committed suicide in the gas chamber. He appears as a green vapor formed into the shape of a human. Hermes is determined to <b>drive</b> <b>Torque</b> into unleashing the evil inside him. Horace P. Gauge (John Armstrong) was an inmate who was executed in the electric chair for murdering his wife during a conjugal visit. Full of guilt for his actions, he claims Carnate drove him to it, and wants to help Torque realize his decency. He appears in the form of electricity. They teach Torque how to unleash the anger inside himself and transform into a powerful monster, although the transformation is only in Torque's mind.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{proposal}} for production {{of what would}} become the AMC Eagle came from Roy Lunn, the chief design engineer for AMC Jeep. [...] "Project 8001 plus Four" [...] was Lunn's code name for a new [...] "line of four-wheel-drive vehicles with the ride and handling conventions of a standard rear wheel drive car" [...] built on a unit-body platform. In February 1977, AMC contracted FF Developments to build a prototype vehicle based on a production V8 powered AMC Hornet with <b>drive</b> <b>torque</b> split 33% front and 66% rear. Testing and further development proved the feasibility of a vehicle with greater ground clearance, larger 15-inch wheels, as well as a torque split closer to 50% - 50%, with Lunn recommending using the AMC straight-6 engine coupled to an automatic transmission.|$|E
50|$|The {{thickened}} mass {{is moved}} toward the bottom centre of the thickener by large rakes that rotate around the tank. Rotation speed is very slow, and drive torques can be high, especially for larger diameter thickeners. <b>Drive</b> <b>torque</b> is usually monitored continuously, as high densities could cause failure of the rakes and drive equipment.

40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} process of seekers, the reduction of disturbance torques (DTs) is a critical but time-consuming work. The innovation of the paper is to present a uniform method to measure and reduce mechanical DTs during gimbal’s assembly process. Firstly, the relationships between assembly parameters and DTs are established and analyzed by theoretical model. And then, a measuring system is established to measure the <b>driven</b> <b>torque</b> of the gimbal’s torque motor. With the goal of stabilizing and minimizing the <b>driven</b> <b>torque,</b> all assembly parameters relating to DTs could be adjusted. Through the proof {{of a lot of}} experiments, this proposed method could reduce the bias and fluctuation of these mechanical DTs. This method could also be used for the mechanical DTs reduction of most similar productions and improve the quality and efficiency during their system assembly process...|$|R
50|$|The New Yorker {{also offered}} Fluid <b>Torque</b> <b>Drive,</b> a true <b>torque</b> converter, {{in place of}} Fluid Drive. Cars with Fluid <b>Torque</b> <b>Drive</b> came only with Fluid Matic {{semi-automatic}} transmission and had a gear selector quadrant on the steering column. Power steering, an industry first, appeared as an option on Chrysler cars with the Hemi engine. It was sold under the name Hydraguide.|$|R
50|$|<b>Torque</b> <b>Drive</b> {{was only}} offered on low-horsepower engines for Camaro, Nova, and the 1971 Vega. It was {{available}} on the Nova four cylinder engine, and on the Turbo-Thrift Sixes for Camaro as well as Nova. Despite its low introductory price of $68.65, most buyers apparently considered the <b>Torque</b> <b>Drive</b> a nuisance to shift, and for a hundred dollars more they could get fully automatic Powerglide, making <b>Torque</b> <b>Drive</b> installations very rare. Apparently the transmission wasn't very durable, since it depended on the driver's ability to shift between gears {{in a way that}} wouldn't damage the unit. After 1971, Chevrolet cancelled semi-automatic <b>Torque</b> <b>Drive.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shaft-driven bikes {{have a large}} {{bevel gear}} where a {{conventional}} bike would have its chain ring. This meshes with another bevel gear mounted on the drive shaft. The use of bevel gears allows the axis of the <b>drive</b> <b>torque</b> from the pedals to be turned through 90 degrees. The drive shaft then has another bevel gear near the rear wheel hub which meshes with a bevel gear on the hub where the rear sprocket would be on a conventional bike, and canceling out the first <b>drive</b> <b>torque</b> change of axis.|$|E
50|$|The Alfa Q4 all {{wheel drive}} system behaves like a {{rear-drive}} vehicle: 100% of torque is distributed to the rear axle. As it reaches the wheel adherence limit, the system transfers up to 60% of the <b>drive</b> <b>torque</b> to the front axle.|$|E

40|$|A general {{approach}} is introduced to allocate the forces {{acting on the}} center of gravity to the four wheels of a vehicle by using an inversion of vehicle dynamics and non-linear optimization.

50|$|For 1951 the Saratoga {{was built}} on the shorter 125.5 inch {{wheelbase}} but offered the Chrysler's famed Hemi V8.

50|$|Bearings {{are mounted}} on the piston pump shaft, which {{transfers}} <b>drive</b> <b>torque</b> to the cylinder block. The bearing’s role is to ensure smooth movement and reduce energy use. Composite bearings’ self-lubricating PTFE layer allows consistent, low friction in pump mechanisms for minimal energy use and reduced maintenance requirements.|$|E
50|$|The second {{advantage}} is that apportioning <b>drive</b> <b>torque</b> among all four wheels greatly diminishes the likelihood of torque steer. Handling dynamics are also improved. Reducing the propulsive force carried by the front tires leaves more adhesion for steering the vehicle into a tight bend or for holding a cornering arc {{in the middle of}} a turn. In other words, the dynamic balance is greatly enhanced by ATC logic.|$|E
50|$|As the {{mainspring}} {{runs down}} (Fig. 2), {{more of the}} chain is wrapped on the barrel, and the chain going to the barrel comes off the wide bottom grooves of the fusee. Now the weaker pull of the mainspring {{is applied to the}} larger radius of the bottom of the fusee. The greater turning moment provided by the larger radius at the fusee compensates for the weaker force of the spring, keeping the <b>drive</b> <b>torque</b> constant.|$|E

40|$|Race {{cars are}} {{characterized}} by very high <b>drive</b> <b>torques</b> and handling performances. However, high torques are useless if they cannot be converted into vehicle acceleration due to macro-slippage of the driven tyres. On the other hand, extreme handling performances are obtained by designing a vehicle that is almost unstable. Thus, small driver errors {{can lead to a}} sudden and unexpected off-road. Traction and instability control is of fundamental importance to avoid macro-sliding of the tyres and to combine extremely high handling performances with a safety margin that allows the driver to stabilize the vehicle...|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} axle {{of the planet}} gear {{is tied to the}} axle of the sun gear by a link that freely rotates around the axis of the sun gear and keeps the planet gear engaged with the sun gear but does not {{contribute}} to the <b>drive</b> <b>torque.</b> This link appears, at first sight, to be similar to a crank but the drive is not transmitted through it. Thus, it did not contravene the crank patent.|$|E
50|$|The third mode of {{all-wheel-drive}} engagement activates {{when the}} driver presses the lock button mounted on the instrument panel. The maximum amount of rear-drive torque is locked in until the vehicle gets moving and exceeds six mph, at which time rear <b>drive</b> <b>torque</b> is gradually diminished. By 18 mph, the lock mode is fully disengaged. When vehicle speed drops below 18 mph, the lock mode automatically reengages. The shift lever {{must be in the}} first, second, or reverse-gear position to use the lock mode.|$|E
50|$|Available on {{all models}} as a factory-fitted option is a rear {{differential}} lock that eliminates the differential between the rear wheels. Working hand-in-hand with the front/rear center differential lockup this new feature helps the driver extract his vehicle when {{bogged down in}} soft surfaces. Refining improvements {{have been made to}} Mitsubishi's ASTC system that regulates brake force and <b>drive</b> <b>torque</b> on an individual wheel basis to deliver better handling and vehicle stability on all surfaces. The ASTC system is now capable of detecting the operating status of the rear differential lock. This allows both systems to be installed {{at the same time and}} thereby extending Pajero's off-road capabilities even further.|$|E

(GA'S) which chooses the parameters of the polynomial, such that the execution time and the <b>drive</b> <b>torques</b> for the robot joints are minimized. With the robot's dynamic constraints taken into account, the optimised trajectories are realisable. A case study with two-planar-moving robots, each having three degrees of freedom, shows that the method is effective...|$|R
50|$|Typical CVT designs require {{high level}} of {{hydraulic}} pressure for operation, and CVT hydraulic-fluid pumps are typically driven {{at the same rate}} as engine speed, leading to pumps wasting considerable effort, lowering transmission efficiency at higher engine speeds as the pump moves more fluid than necessary to lubricate and sandwich the CVT's belt. Hydraulic pressure was reduced to an optimal point to protect against belt slippage, while conserving drive effort to limit excess pumping losses in the new design; also, the oil pump features a coaxial 2-port design that enables a 25-percent reduction in pump <b>drive</b> <b>torque,</b> lowering its parasitic draw on the engine.|$|E
50|$|A {{change in}} speed {{out of this}} stable {{operating}} point is only possible with a new control intervention. This can be changing the load of the machine or {{the power of the}} drive which both changes the torque because it is a change in the characteristic curves. The drive-machine system then runs to a new operating point with a different speed and a different balance of torques. Should the <b>drive</b> <b>torque</b> be higher than the counter torque at any time then the system does not have an operating point. The result will be that the speed increases up to the idle speed or even until destruction. Should the counter torque be higher at any times the speed will decrease until the system stops.|$|E

50|$|SS4-II {{allows the}} driver to lock the center {{differential}} for maximum <b>drive</b> <b>torque</b> over poor surfaces. The driver can also allow the viscous coupling type center differential to automatically tailor its basic 33:67 F-R torque split to suit different surfaces and conditions.In 2H mode, the road friction losses are minimized to allow maximum fuel economy and is also the ideal mode for urban driving in fine weather. The standard operating mode for SS4 II is the 4H mode which caters {{to a wide range}} of conditions: driving around town, on expressways or country roads; and driving over packed snow, icy surfaces, flat dirt and other off-road conditions. Selecting 4HLc mode locks the center differential so that drive is transmitted through all four wheels to enable driving in soft snow, sand, dirt or other high-resistance conditions. The 4LLc mode locks the center differential and by keeping the transmission in a low gear it enables driving on rocky terrains or swampy conditions where extra drive is required.|$|E
50|$|Torque {{vectoring}} differentials on {{front or}} {{rear wheel drive}} vehicles are less complex, yet share {{many of the same}} benefits as all-wheel drive differentials. The differential only varies torque between two wheels. The electronic monitoring system only monitors two wheels, making it less complex. A front-wheel drive differential must take into account several factors. It must monitor rotational and steering angle of the wheels. As these factors vary during driving, different forces are exerted on the wheels. The differential monitors these forces, and adjusts torque accordingly. Many front-wheel drive differentials can increase or decrease torque transmitted to a certain wheel. This ability improves a vehicle’s capability to maintain traction in poor weather conditions. When one wheel begins to slip, the differential can reduce the torque to that wheel, effectively braking the wheel. The differential also increases torque to the opposite wheel, helping balance the power output and keep the vehicle stable. A rear-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>torque</b> vectoring differential works the same way as a front-wheel drive differential.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: The {{linear motor}} drive {{is widely used}} in driving an {{extrusion}} puller in an aluminum extrusion industry. The main disadvantage of this drive is manual and step-wise torque control. This research was done to replace the linear motor drive by AC <b>drive</b> with direct <b>torque</b> control technology. Approach: Mathematical calculations were carried to select an AC drive which satisfied parameters and values required for production process.
