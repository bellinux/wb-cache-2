5|$|Monson {{has written}} a number of books, {{some of which are}} {{compilations}} of speeches given by him, or of quotes. Others discuss particular LDS gospel themes.

5|$|Monson later oversaw church {{operations}} <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> {{and helped}} the church gain access in the Soviet bloc.

5|$|As the United States was {{initiating}} the Marshall Plan, Kennan and the Truman administration {{hoped that the}} Soviet Union's rejection of Marshall aid would strain its relations with its Communist allies <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe.</b> Kennan initiated a series of efforts to exploit the schism between the Soviets and Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia. Kennan proposed conducting covert action in the Balkans to further decrease Moscow's influence.|$|E

5|$|Conspiracy {{theorists have}} long {{associated}} Freemasonry with the New World Order and the Illuminati, and state that Freemasonry as an organisation is either bent on world domination or already secretly {{in control of}} world politics. Historically, Freemasonry has attracted criticism—and suppression—from both the politically far right (e.g., Nazi Germany) and the far left (e.g. the former Communist states <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe).</b>|$|E
5|$|During August 2016, it was {{announced}} that 650 soldiers of the British Army would be deployed on an enduring basis <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> mainly in Estonia with some also being deployed to Poland. This British deployment forms part of a four-battle group (four-battalion) deployment by various allies, NATO Enhanced Forward Presence, one each spread from Poland (the Poland-deployed battle group mostly led by the U.S.) to Estonia.|$|E
5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe.</b> There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record.

5|$|In 1993, the {{collapse}} of the USSR <b>in</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> gave many new countries the opportunity to compete. Three countries—Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, all of them former Yugoslav republics, won through from a pre-qualifier to compete. After the 1993 event, a relegation system was introduced, allowing even more Eastern European countries to compete: seven more made their debut in 1994.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> Milica Bakić–Hayden {{developed}} {{the concept of}} Nesting Orientalisms (1992), derived from {{the ideas of the}} historian Larry Wolff (Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on the Mind of the Enlightenment, 1994) and Said's ideas in Orientalism (1978). The Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova (Imagining the Balkans, 1997) presented the ethnologic concept of Nesting Balkanisms (Ethnologia Balkanica, 1997), which is derived from Milica Bakić–Hayden's concept of Nesting Orientalisms.|$|E
5|$|In Moscow, Kennan again {{felt that}} his {{opinions}} were being ignored by Harry S. Truman and policymakers in Washington. Kennan tried repeatedly to persuade policymakers to abandon plans for {{cooperation with the}} Soviet government {{in favor of a}} sphere of influence policy in Europe to reduce the Soviets' power there. Kennan believed that a federation needed to be established in western Europe to counter Soviet influence in the region and to compete against the Soviet stronghold <b>in</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Europe.</b>|$|E

5|$|Locating new bodies is {{also not}} without {{political}} disputes. The European Central Bank's (ECB) seat had to symbolise its independence from political control, and was located in a city which did not already host a national government or European institution.
