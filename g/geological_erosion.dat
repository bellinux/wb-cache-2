Breeder reactors would constantly replenish the available supply of nuclear fuel by converting fertile materials, such as uranium-238 and thorium, into fissile isotopes of plutonium or uranium-233, respectively. Fertile materials are also nonrenewable, but their supply on Earth is extremely large, with a supply timeline greater than geothermal energy.

Here, parallel evolution was studied by focusing on waterfall and the landlocked freshwater goby Rhinogobius sp. YB (YB), which evolved from amphidromous R. brunneus (BR). The fish fauna was surveyed at 30 sites in 11 rivers on Iriomote Island, Japan, the geography of which was characterized by terraces/tablelands with many waterfalls. We found that all YB individuals were distributed only above waterfalls (height 6. 8 – 58. 7 m), whereas BR, and other fishes, were mostly distributed below waterfalls. Mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that every YB local population above the waterfall was independently evolved from BR. In contrast, cluster analysis of nine morphological characters, such as fin color and body pattern, showed that the morphology of YB individuals held a similarity beyond the genetic divergence, suggesting parallel evolution has occurred relating to their morphology. Genetic distance between each YB local population and BR was significantly correlated with waterfall height (r 2 = 0. 94), suggesting that the waterfalls have been heightened due to the constant <b>geological</b> <b>erosion</b> and that their height represents the isolation period of YB local populations from BR (ca. 11, 000 – 88, 000 years). Each local population of BR was once landlocked in upstream by waterfall formation, consequently evolving to YB in each site. Although the morphology of YB had a high degree of similarity among local populations, finer scale analysis showed that the morphology of YB was significantly correlated with the genetic distance from BR. Consequently, there could be simultaneous multiple phases of allopatric/parallel evolution of the goby due to variations in waterfall height on this small island...|$|E

Towards this end, the main objective of the research was the analysis of the geo-ecological factors that produced impact on the urban areas exposed to complex geomorphological conditions with a view to their functional use at minimal environmental risks and most favorable conditions for human beings. The authors employed theoretical and practical research methods, including: (1) geo-morphological analysis of urban areas, (2) monitoring and analysis of the human impact produced on the environmental components, (3) development of approaches to the functional use and development of urban areas in a complex geomorphologic setting.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} natural and human causes {{giving rise to}} {{the erosion of the}} Cilento rocky coasts. It is {{predictable}} that, in 2100, along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea a sea level rise varying between 9 and 30 cm will be attained. This increase will also cause a marked rise in the erosion of rocky coasts because a wide extension of highly erodible rock masses characterizes the studied area. Data regarding failure mechanisms, landslide mobility as well as run out distances of about 228 landslides directly or indirectly triggered by the wave motion were collected. Using these data and the IFFI Catalogue (“Inventario Fenomeni Franosi Italiani”), a Coastal Landslide Density Map was drawn that displays landslide density areas varying between 2 and 10 landslides per km 2. In addition to climatic, geomorphological and <b>geological</b> causes, coastal <b>erosion</b> is worsened by a poor supply of sediments providing beaches, coming from the nine main rivers of the area. Furthermore, these sediments show a granulometric sorting mainly towards fine sands and silts which are not suitable for the beach-nourishment. In order to obtain a relative estimate of net erosion and deposition along the bed rivers, the USPED (Unit Stream Power - based Erosion Deposition) model was applied that allowed to calculate a value of solid discharge, from the rivers of the area, of about 11 millions of T/year. An assessment of the potential degree of landslide hazard and rockfall mobility was performed by means of heuristic approaches based on the “Rock Engineering System” and “Reach Probability” methods.

Characteristics of shale gas enrichment in the formation shown by detailed profiling and analysis are summarized as “high, handsome and rich”. “High” mainly refers to the high quality of original materials for the formation of shale with excellent key parameters, including the good type and high abundance of organic matters, high content of brittle minerals and moderate thermal evolution. “Handsome” means late and weak deformation, favorable deformation mode and structure, and appropriate uplift and current burial depth. “Rich” includes high gas content, high formation pressure coefficient, good reservoir property, favorable reservoir scale transformation and high initial and final output, with relative ease of development and obvious economic benefit. For shale gas enrichment and high yield, it is important that the combination of shale was deposited and formed in excellent conditions (geological construction), and then underwent appropriate tectonic deformation, uplift, and <b>erosion</b> (<b>geological</b> transformation). Evaluation based on geological construction (evolution sequence from formation to the reservoir) includes sequence stratigraphy and sediment, hydrocarbon generation and formation of reservoir pores. Based on geological transformation (evolution sequence from the reservoir to preservation), the strata should be evaluated for structural deformation, the formation of reservoir fracture and preservation of shale gas. The evaluation of the “construction - transformation” sequence is to cover the whole process of shale gas formation and preservation. This way, both positive and negative effects of the formation-transformation sequence on shale gas are assessed.

40|$|Geotextiles {{have been}} used for many years in {{different}} parts of the world to promote soil conservation and to combat erosion. Such geotextiles may be synthetic (usually some form of plastic, sometimes with wire), or natural (usually some form of fibrous material). Work carried out at the University of Wolverhampton (UK) on the effectiveness of mats made from palm tree leaves sourced from the Gambia, West Africa led to a research project funded by the EU, which ran from October 2005 to February 2009, comprising the participation of four EU countries (UK, Belgium, Hungary and Lithuania) and six developing” countries (Brazil, Gambia, South Africa, Thailand, China and Vietnam). Research carried out in South Africa used mats made from the leaves of the Lala palm (Hyperhene coriacea). These mats are easy to make, flexible, durable and completely biodegradable. They cover approximately 40 % of the soil surface, allowing space for vegetation to emerge, and add 1. 3 kg of dry organic matter to each m 2 of soil. Furthermore, they have a water retention capacity of 1. 8 l kg- 1 m- 2, their N, K, S and P percentages are high, they have low sodium and aluminium values and a favourable C/N ratio. Firstly, trials were done on 20 South African soils and 10 mine tailings materials using a rainfall simulator. The soils varied considerably with respect to their textural, chemical and mineralogical properties as well as annual precipitation and <b>geological</b> origin. <b>Erosion</b> parameters varied greatly within, and to a much lesser extent between, the two different materials. Several significant correlations were obtained. Sediment load (SL) had the best correlation with kaolinite content and with fine sand content, while for runoff, the best correlation was with organic carbon content. When the samples were covered with palm mats values for final infiltration rate (FI) percentage stable aggregates (SA) and inter-rill erodibility (Ki) values were similar to those of bare materials and the amount of runoff was slightly higher. SL, however, was reduced by + 65 %. The next stage was to carry out a range of field trials, using runoff plots. Plots at four localities (Bergville, Ladybrand, Roodeplaat and Mabula) were used. Results showed that average runoff under the palm mats decreased by between 38 % and 70 %, compared to bare soil. Sediment concentration under the mats decreased by between 38 % and 89 %, using three combinations of slope, mat density and mesh size. Splash erosion at Roodeplaat decreased by between 62 % and 68 %, while re-vegetation at Ladybrand and Mabula increased by between 38 % and 58 %, with organic carbon content and topsoil accumulation also increasing under the mats. Various trials (using both the rainfall simulator and runoff plots) were carried out to evaluate the effects of reduced mat density and increased mesh size. Results from the other participating countries (25 % to 95 % reduction in runoff) confirm that there is much potential to use organic, bio-degradable, easy to manufacture geotextiles such as palm leaf mats, especially to combine employment opportunities with enhanced environmental protection in many susceptible areas of South Africa.

40|$|Rivers {{draining}} to the Great Barrier Reef {{are receiving}} increased attention with the realisation that European land use changes {{over the last}} not, vert, similar 150 years may have increased river sediment yields, and that these may have adversely affected the reef environment. Mitigation of the effects associated with such changes is only possible if information on the spatial provenance and dominant types of erosion is known. To date, very few field-based studies have attempted to provide this information. This study uses fallout radionuclide (137 Cs and 210 Pbex) and geochemical tracing of river bed and floodplain sediments to examine sources over the last not, vert, similar 250 years for Theresa Creek, a subcatchment of the Fitzroy River basin, central Queensland, Australia. A Monte Carlo style mixing model is used to predict the relative contribution of both the spatial (<b>geological)</b> sources and <b>erosion</b> types. The results indicate that sheetwash and rill erosion from cultivated basaltic land and channel erosion from non-basaltic parts of the catchment are currently contributing most sediment to the river system. Evidence indicates that the dominant form of channel erosion is gully headcut and sidewall erosion. Sheetwash and rill erosion from uncultivated land (i. e., grazed pasture/woodland) is a comparatively minor contributor of sediment to the river network. Analysis of the spatial provenance of floodplain core sediments, in conjunction with optical dating and 137 Cs depth profile data, suggests that a phase of channel erosion was initiated {{in the late nineteenth}} century. With the development of land underlain by basalt in the mid-twentieth century the dominant source of erosion shifted to cultivated land, although improvements in land management practices have probably resulted in a decrease in sediment yield from cultivated areas in the later half of the twentieth century. On a basin-wide scale, because of the limited spatial extent of cultivation, channel sources are likely to be the largest contributor of sediment to the Fitzroy River. Accordingly, catchment management measures focused on reducing sediment delivery to the Great Barrier Reef should focus primarily on decreasing erosion from channel sources. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} several methods of potential usefulness in identifying some of the factors causing erosion in two catchments 'typical' of the southern Ruahine Ranges. The condition of the southern Ruahine Ranges, in the headwaters of the Manawatu River catchment, is deteriorating. The state of equilibrium which has periodically existed between rock, soil, slope, vegetation, and climate has recently been upset, and the area is now in a state of decline. Unless remedial action is taken promptly, farm land will go out of production, public water supplies could be ruined, communications by rail, road, and telephone severely hindered, and the benefits of both the Pohangina-Oroua and Lower Manawatu Flood Control and Drainage Schemes could be lost. This study attempts to establish a basis from which positive steps to rectify the situation can be implemented. Methodology involved the use of aerial photography and on-the-ground observations and measurements. Colour and colour infrared film types were compared with standard black-and-white panchromatic film to establish which was the most suitable to use in determining priorities for erosion control. Sequential panchromatic aerial photographs were taken in 1946, 1961, 1966, and 1974. In this mountainous area, aerial photographs are essential tools for determining the extent of eroded surfaces and erosion types. Between 1946 and 1974 there has been a 120 percent increase in area of eroded slopes in the study area. The worst erosion in 1946, at which time herbivorous mammals had had little effect on vegetation, and in 1974, occurred in the 700 to 900 m altitudinal zone. This zone has the highest fault density in the study area, which consists of densely faulted and mélange-like rocks. This area has also undergone the most dramatic vegetation changes since 1946. Herbivorous mammals are considered to be only partly responsible for such changes. As a corollary, the highest percent increase in erosion has occurred in the altitudinal zone with the most intact vegetative canopy. A positive relationship between the frequency of medium-sized earthquakes and increase of eroded areas has been tentatively established. Further, most erosion has occurred during and following intense rainstorms. These two factors are considered to be the main ones causing erosion in the area. Once factors causing erosion had been established, colour, colour infrared, and panchromatic film types were compared. Photographs used in this comparison were taken periodically throughout 1975 using a 35 mm camera. An assessment was made of the capabilities of each film type to show the following features: alignments, eroded surfaces, erosion types, vegetation types and condition, rock types, pug zones, seepage areas, and drainage pattern. Colour infrared was found to be the most suitable to use when determining priorities for erosion control. A number of salient procedures that should be undertaken to determine priorities for erosion control are outlined.
