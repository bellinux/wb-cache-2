40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{circumstances}} in which the MFB will support the removal of canvas hose from existing hydrant installations. It is to be noted that a Building Surveyor is the person having the authority to approve the deletion of hose from existing hydrants. The process involves the <b>issuing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building <b>permit</b> by the (relevant) building surveyor to carry out demolition work. 2. Scope This guideline is intended to cover only existing hydrant installations designed and installed under previous regulations, which required the hydrants to be equipped with canvas hose. Current Building Regulations and relevant Australian Standards do not contain any reference to the equipping <b>of</b> hydrants. <b>A</b> Practice Note (No. 31) - “Deletion Of Hose From Existing Fire Hydrants” issued by the Building Commission should be referenced in conjunction with this Guideline. 3. Body In line with the Australian Standard (AS 2419. 1), the MFB regards hydrants as a facility primarily for their use. Accordingly, when hydrants are used, the MFB will provide their own equipment. However, there may be some instances where equipped hydrants may be required, eg as a decision associated with a Regulation 309 Report and Consent (under the Building Regulations 2006) or a dangerous goods report (compiled under relevant Dangerous Goods legislation).

40|$|Victims {{of human}} {{trafficking}} {{should be protected}} to prevent their revictimisation. This article compares the way the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy protect victims of human trafficking. The reason for this comparison is because the UK {{does not have any}} specific law that grants <b>a</b> residence <b>permit</b> to victims of human trafficking. The only way victims could be protected in the UK is when they can demonstrate their rights under the Refugee Convention or the European Convention on Human Rights. In contrast, Italian law establishes the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> residence <b>permit</b> to victims of human trafficking. Unfortunately, rarely this law is applied and often victims are confused with other irregular migrants and criminals and expelled. In an Italian city called Rimini, Italian law has been adequately applied and the phenomenon of trafficking in human beings has been completely defeated. In the article, the Rimini Method is described. Moreover, the findings of interviews held in Rimini {{with the head of the}} Italian Police in Rimini and with the responsible <b>of</b> <b>an</b> anti-trafficking organization which supported the Police in Rimini are shown, with the aim to explain how trafficking in human beings in Rimini has been defeated. Finally, this article argues that the UK should follow this example and a first step to protect victims of human trafficking should be, as the British Joint Committee on Human Rights highlighted, to sign and ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Actions against Trafficking in Human Beings...|$|R
50|$|The {{controversial}} Riverfront Research Park {{is a small}} facility {{maintained by}} the university, located across Franklin Boulevard from the main campus, next to the Willamette River. The park is used for creating new technologies, such as research about artificial intelligence at the Computational Intelligence Research Lab, {{and it is the}} home of the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN), the zebrafish model organism database. Local controversy has existed since before the development and approval of the site master plan by the City of Eugene in 1989. Controversy stems from the lack of citizen involvement in the planning process for the use of public lands, and the potential for multi-story office buildings and parking lots to replace open space, civic space, and wildlife habitat along the Willamette River. The University and Student Senates have each passed resolutions against construction {{on the banks of the}} Willamette River under the current development plan, yet plans for development persist.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPolitical analysis must {{keep pace with}} rapidly changing, ever more complex international relations. This thesis suggests that <b>a</b> systematic study <b>of</b> the nuclear energy issue is one logical choice for comprehensive international political analysis. Nuclear power policies and debates are examined {{for their ability to}} reflect current international trends of conflict and cooperation. Nuclear-related events trigger responses over <b>a</b> wide range <b>of</b> <b>issues,</b> <b>permitting</b> <b>an</b> analyst to observe the various courses of national foreign policy in action. As one observes how nations interact in response to nuclear events, patterns are revealed, thus increasing one's knowledge of contemporary international relations. A paradigm is offered to systematize the analysis <b>of</b> nuclear-related events. <b>A</b> nuclear perspective is illustrated by examining worldwide trends on a global scale, European trends on a continental scale, and French foreign and domestic policies on a national scale. The nuclear power perspective serves as a valuable analytical tool with which to chart and interpret trends and events. [URL] United States Air Forc...|$|R
