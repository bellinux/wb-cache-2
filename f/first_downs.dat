5|$|Entering the bye, the Bears had the seventh-best third down {{conversion}} percentage with 43.68, {{while having}} 118 <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> converted, {{one more than}} that of teams that the Bears had played.|$|E
5|$|The Bears offense broke four team {{records in}} 2013: the most total yards with 6,109, the most passing yards with 4,450, the most passing touchdowns with 32, {{and the most}} <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> with 344.|$|E
5|$|As {{the quarter}} {{came to an}} end, the Hokies gained two quick <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> and {{advanced}} the ball 26yards, seemingly having regained the momentum lost with the blocked kick. With onequarter remaining in the game, however, Kansas still had a three-point lead, 1714.|$|E
5000|$|First down: The term [...] "first down" [...] can be {{used both}} as the <b>first</b> <b>down</b> {{in a series of}} downs, and for the {{statistical}} achievement of gaining the required ten yards to be awarded a new <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> When a team begins a new possession--for example following a kickoff by their opponents--their first play in the ensuing series of downs will be [...] "first down". However, it would not be recorded as a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> for statistical purposes as they didn't do anything to achieve the <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Statistically they are only credited with a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> if they gain the required ten yards to be awarded a new series of downs.|$|R
5|$|Texas' post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech four-yard line. A two-yard run was followed by an 11-yard carry by Ken Oxendine who earned a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 17-yard line. After the <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> Oxendine earned another six yards. Druckenmiller then completed a 13-yard pass to tight end Bryan Jennings for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 35-yard line. Texas committed a five-yard offsides penalty, then a long pass downfield fell incomplete. Two more plays failed to gain a <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> and the Hokies punted.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Officials use {{the chains}} to measure for a <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Here, {{the ball is}} {{just short of the}} pole and {{therefore}} short of a <b>first</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
5|$|Buck Flowers {{starred in}} the 118–0 victory over Furman. Joe Guyon played in the line and did well. Tech made 34 <b>first</b> <b>downs.</b> For one score, in the fourth quarter, Flowers hit Red Barron on a 72-yard {{touchdown}} pass that went 42 yards in the air.|$|E
5|$|In the San Diego East-West Christmas Classic, Centre {{defeated}} Arizona 38–0 as {{rain fell}} throughout the game. Red Roberts scored the first touchdown five {{minutes into the}} match. Bo McMillin went over the right tackle for another score. Centre led 18–0 at the half as Arizona was held to no <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> in two quarters of play.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half, the Eagles offense {{recorded}} 20first downs. In the second half, it managed just four <b>first</b> <b>downs,</b> {{three of which}} came in one drive in the fourth quarter. As a result of second-half pressure from Virginia Tech, Ryan was forced into two late-game interceptions, including one that was returned for a Virginia Tech defensive touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{began the}} second quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second down and one yard. After the Tech offense picked up one <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> it was unable to gain another. Facing a fourth down and needing fiveyards for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Air Force 29-yard line, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to try to gain the <b>first</b> <b>down</b> instead of trying a long field goal. Bryan Randall was sacked for a loss of 10yards, however, and the Hokies turned the ball over to Air Force after failing to gain the <b>first</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
5|$|The first Eagles' {{play after}} the Tech punt was a 22-yard pass from Davis to Gunnell for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 47-yard line. Following the long gain, the Eagles {{were unable to}} gain another <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> and punted back to the Hokies. The kick was fair caught at the Tech 16-yard line with 11:08 {{remaining}} in the third quarter, and the Virginia Tech offense returned to the field. Tech advanced the ball on three consecutive plays: a six-yard pass to Evans, a short rush by Evans, then a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> pass to Roberts. Following the <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> Evans ran for another <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> advancing the Hokies to their 44-yard line. Two Tech plays were stopped for little or no gain, but on third and nine, Taylor scrambled for an 18-yard gain and a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Boston College 37-yard line. Evans gained six yards on <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> but the Hokies were unable to gain the next four yards. Instead of punting, Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent kicker Jared Keys into the game to attempt a field goal. Keys' 50-yard kick sailed through the uprights, and Tech extended its lead to 17–7 with 6:07 remaining in the quarter.|$|R
5|$|The {{first play}} of the Tech drive {{resulted}} in a 12-yard gain as Josh Hyman rushed for 12 yards and a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on an end-around. Running back Cedric Humes was stopped for a loss on the first play after Hyman's rush, but earned 10yards on two subsequent rushes, setting up a fourth down. Needing one yard for a <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> behind by 16points, and with time running down in the quarter, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to attempt the <b>first</b> <b>down</b> play rather than kick a field goal. Humes again rushed the ball, and as time ran out in the third quarter, picked up enough ground for the <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> With one quarter of play remaining, Auburn led Virginia Tech 16–0, but the Hokies had picked up a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> inside the Auburn 10-yard line to begin the fourth quarter.|$|R
5|$|Miami's Jimmy Cox {{was named}} the game's most {{valuable}} player after catching five passes for 77yards—accounting for nearly half of Miami's total offensive output. Miami earned just three rushing <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> during the game, setting a Liberty Bowl record {{that has yet to}} be broken.|$|E
5|$|Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick set the Humanitarian Bowl passing yardage {{record with}} 370yards through the air, and he scored three {{touchdowns in the}} process. Despite the loss, Kaepernick's team {{outperformed}} Maryland in terms of passing yardage, total offense, <b>first</b> <b>downs,</b> and time of possession.|$|E
5|$|Nevada {{recorded}} better statistics than Maryland {{in several}} areas despite ultimately losing the game. The Wolf Pack compiled seven more <b>first</b> <b>downs,</b> 172more passing yards, 28more total offensive yards, 15fewer penalty yards, 15.8%more third down conversions, and 2:26more time in possession of the ball.|$|E
50|$|If {{a penalty}} against the {{defensive}} team moves the ball past {{the line to}} gain, the offensive team gets a new <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Some defensive penalties give the offense an automatic <b>first</b> <b>down</b> regardless of the distance.|$|R
50|$|Some {{defensive}} penalties {{give the}} offense an automatic <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Conversely, some offensive penalties result in {{loss of a}} down (loss {{of the right to}} repeat the down). If a penalty gives the offensive team enough yardage to gain a <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> they get a <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> as usual. However, if the offense commits a foul in its own end zone, the defense scores an automatic safety if the penalty is accepted.|$|R
5|$|The ball {{rolled out}} of bounds at the one-yard line, and Tech was penalized half the {{distance}} to the goal line due to a holding penalty during the kick. Pegues ran for a two-yard gain, then was stopped for a loss of one yard on second down. On third down, Clark completed a pass to Harrison for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the 11-yard line. After the <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> a Tech running play was stopped for a loss of three yards, then Clark scrambled to the 16-yard line, five yards short of the <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Stith then gained the <b>first</b> <b>down</b> with a run to the 25-yard line. During this time, Tech concentrated on running out the clock by executing multiple running plays, which do not stop the game clock, unlike passing plays. After the <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> Clark was sacked by Alabama defender Cornelius Griffin for a loss of seven yards. Clark regained the lost yards with a nine-yard pass, then picked up a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> with a shovel pass. On <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> Clark completed a pass to Ricky Hall with a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Alabama 45-yard line. At this point, Tech switched from running down the clock to attempting passes downfield in hopes of scoring before halftime. With 32 seconds remaining in the first half, Clark threw an incomplete pass. Clark then was sacked by the Alabama defense, setting up third down at the Tech 46-yard line. Stith ran for a short gain, then Tech set up for a long pass downfield on fourth down.|$|R
5|$|The Bulldogs next {{faced the}} Cleveland Tigers, their first APFA opponent, and won 7–0 before {{a crowd of}} 7,000 people. Despite the Bulldogs' 15 <b>first</b> <b>downs,</b> the only score of the game came on Martin's 7-yard {{touchdown}} run in the first quarter. Thorpe made his season debut in the game, coming in as a substitute in the fourth quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{improved}} to 8–0 with a 24–7 {{win over the}} Indianapolis Colts in front of 56,688 in the Hoosier Dome. The Giants' defense held the Colts to 11 <b>first</b> <b>downs,</b> 181 total yards and 55 rushing yards. Simms completed 17 of 21 passes for 172yards, with no touchdowns and was picked once, which ended his streak of 150 passes without an interception. Defensive end Leonard Marshall sacked Colts quarterback Jeff George twice, Dave Duerson returned a fumble for a touchdown and the Giants' defense held George to 160yards passing on 37 pass attempts. The Giants controlled the game from the start, ending the first half leading 17–0, and besting the Colts 206 to 45 in total yards, 13 to 1 in <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> and 20:57 to 9:03 in time of possession.|$|E
5|$|The Lobos gained {{three more}} <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> on their final drive, but {{were unable to}} score again before turning the ball over on downs. The Midshipmen ran one more quarterback kneel play to run out the clock, winning {{the game with a}} final score of 34–19.|$|E
50|$|The {{first play}} of the Tech drive {{resulted}} in a 12-yard gain as Josh Hyman rushed for 12 yards and a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on an end-around. Running back Cedric Humes was stopped for a loss on the first play after Hyman's rush, but earned 10 yards on two subsequent rushes, setting up a fourth down. Needing one yard for a <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> behind by 16 points, and with time running down in the quarter, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to attempt the <b>first</b> <b>down</b> play rather than kick a field goal. Humes again rushed the ball, and as time ran out in the third quarter, picked up enough ground for the <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> With one quarter of play remaining, Auburn led Virginia Tech 16-0, but the Hokies had picked up a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> inside the Auburn 10-yard line to begin the fourth quarter.|$|R
5|$|Following Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, Wake Forest {{received}} the ball, {{but failed to}} gain a <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> The Deacons' offense went three and out {{and was forced to}} punt. On Tech's next possession, they too had difficulty moving the football on offense. Though they picked up a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> off of a penalty on Wake Forest, they were unable to gain a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> by their own devices and were forced to punt the ball away.|$|R
5|$|Florida State's kickoff was fielded {{inside the}} Virginia Tech five-yard line and {{returned}} to the Tech eight-yard line. Tech gained five yards on two running plays, then Noel completed a 15-yard pass to Davis for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 28-yard line. Noel and Jones each carried the ball, together gaining enough for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 39-yard line. A completed pass and a short run by Jones resulted in another <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> this time at the 50-yard line. Florida State committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but the Hokies were unable to gain a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on the Seminoles' side of the field. Rather than attempt to convert another fourth down, the Hokies punted the ball.|$|R
5|$|Williams {{dealt with}} {{repeated}} injuries while {{playing for the}} Carolina Panthers. His injuries prevented him from being a consistent starter despite multiple opportunities. In 2012, Williams played a complete season and contributed to a team record 29 <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> in a single game.|$|E
5|$|After the missed kick, California {{took over}} at its 12-yard line. Aaron Rodgers {{completed}} three passes for 58yards and Arrington added 15yards on an end-around run. It took California 2:44 in game time to advance 88yards for a touchdown. The score tied {{the game at}} 28–28 with 10:12 {{to go in the}} quarter. Tech received the post-touchdown kickoff and gained two quick <b>first</b> <b>downs,</b> but after advancing the ball beyond its own 40-yard line, was forced to punt it back to California.|$|E
5|$|After the punt, the Pirates {{were unable}} to obtain a first down. Three plays netted only twoyards, and ECU was forced to punt the ball away. On the ensuing drive, Boise State {{completed}} three <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> on the series. BSU kicker Kyle Brotzman, converted a 31yard field goal and the Broncos shrank the ECU lead further. The series went 40yards in nine plays. It took the team two minutes and 37seconds to score.|$|E
5|$|Linton ran {{for nine}} yards, {{then picked up}} a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> with a five-yard gain on second down. Keldorf {{completed}} a 12-yard pass to Barnes for a <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> Linton ran seven yards to the Carolina 43-yard line, then gained another <b>first</b> <b>down</b> with a run to the 50-yard line. From midfield, Keldorf attempted a deep pass on <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> but the ball fell incomplete. On second down, Keldorf completed a four-yard pass to Linton but was sacked on third down by the Virginia Tech defense. The sack forced Carolina to punt {{for the second time}} in the game, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line.|$|R
50|$|Florida State's kickoff was fielded {{inside the}} Virginia Tech five-yard line and {{returned}} to the Tech eight-yard line. Tech gained five yards on two running plays, then Noel completed a 15-yard pass to Davis for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 28-yard line. Noel and Jones each carried the ball, together gaining enough for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 39-yard line. A completed pass and a short run by Jones resulted in another <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> this time at the 50-yard line.

The sack forced Carolina to punt {{for the second time}} in the game, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line.|$|R
5|$|Because they {{deferred}} their {{selection to}} the second half during the opening coin toss, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the half. The Hokies continued to rotate between quarterbacks Sean Glennon and Tyrod Taylor during the possession, and picked up two <b>first</b> <b>downs,</b> one {{through the air and}} the other on the ground. After Glennon was sacked at the 50-yard line, however, the drive sputtered and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball.|$|E
5|$|The only points {{allowed by}} the team were in a 3 to 2 loss to Northwestern in a game played in a heavy {{rainstorm}} on a field covered in mud five or six inches deep in some places. Michigan shut out seven of its eight opponents and allowed only four <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> {{in the last three}} games of the season.|$|E
5|$|Zerfoss {{entered the}} game with an injury. Curry ran for 80 yards to score a {{touchdown}} on a fumbled punt. Cody booted a 20-yard field goal for the only other Commodores' score. Vanderbilt could only manage five <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> in the contest. The starting lineup was Adams (left end), Lipscomb (left tackle), Putnam (left guard), Reyer (center), Williams (right guard), Cody (right tackle), Cohen (right end), Curry (quarterback), Floyd (left halfback), Zerfoss (right halfback), and Wiggs (fullback).|$|E
5|$|The Hurricanes {{picked up}} a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on one rush each from Hobbs and Roan, but were unable to gain another. After a Miami punt, Tech {{returned}} to offense from its 46-yard line. Casey {{picked up a}} <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on a pass, then gained another after a seven-yard scramble that followed a three-yard rush by Lawrence. Lawrence then gained a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on his own after rushing for nine yards and five yards, driving the Hokies to the Miami 15-yard line in the process. After entering the Miami red zone, however, Tech was unable to gain a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> and Casey was sacked for a loss of 13 yards. Facing a fourth down and needing 20 yards for a <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> Tech coach Bill Dooley sent in kicker Dennis Laury to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and with 29 {{seconds left in the}} first half, Tech cut Miami's lead to 143.|$|R
5000|$|The {{chains are}} brought {{onto the field}} {{whenever}} the referee needs an accurate measurement {{to determine if a}} <b>first</b> <b>down</b> has been made. A team may also request an accurate measurement to determine how far they have to reach for the <b>first</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1st & goal: <b>First</b> <b>down,</b> {{where the}} goal line is the line to gain, for example, 1st and goal on the 8 yard line. A team cannot make another <b>first</b> <b>down</b> (barring a {{defensive}} penalty) without actually scoring. Similarly, [...] "2nd and goal", etc.|$|R
