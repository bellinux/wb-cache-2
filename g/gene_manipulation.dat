25|$|This {{concept of}} decisively {{altering}} genes has {{coined the concept}} of the Designer Baby. Currently, PGD can alter some physical and health attributes, and projections for the future power of PGD in its ability to create the ideal human has raised many ethical issues. Projections for societal repercussions include changing the realm of athletics, creating human weapons, and exchanging autonomy over one’s life course for predesignation. Also, with a limited view of the future, it is difficult to alter a human’s genetic makeup without knowing full repercussions. For example, through gene therapy, a lab was able to make rats lose weight, but the long-term effects of the <b>gene</b> <b>manipulation</b> lead to worry of toxin production and too much weight loss. To prevent some of these issues from arising, scientists work towards stabilising the entire process to make it safer before applying a higher degree of gene modification to the human embryos in IVF.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} recent {{advance in}} the functional analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes {{is the development of}} the one-step PCR-mediated technique for deletion and modification of chromosomal genes. This method allows very rapid <b>gene</b> <b>manipulations</b> without requiring plasmid clones of the gene of interest. We describe here a new set of plasmids that serve as templates for the PCR synthesis of fragments that allow a variety of gene modifications. Using as selectable marker the S. cerevisiae TRP 1 gene or modules containing the heterologous Schizosaccharomyces pombe his 5 + or Escherichia coli kanr gene, these plasmids allow gene deletion, gene overexpression (using the regulatable GAL 1 promoter), C- or N-terminal protein tagging [with GFP(S 65 T), GST, or the 3 HA or 13 Myc epitope], and partial N- or C-terminal deletions (with or without concomitant protein tagging). Because of the modular nature of the plasmids, they allow eYcient and economical use of a small number of PCR primers {{for a wide variety of}} <b>gene</b> <b>manipulations.</b> Thus, these plasmids should further facilitate the rapid analysis of gene function in S. cerevisiae. ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. key words — epitope tagging; green fluorescent protein; functional analysis; overexpression studies; gene deletion; gene truncation; polymerase chain reactio...|$|R
40|$|In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe the {{prevailing}} approach for <b>gene</b> <b>manipulations</b> {{is based on}} homologous recombination of a PCR product that contains genomic target sequences and a selectable marker. The CRISPR/Cas 9 system has recently been implemented in fission yeast, which allows for seamless genome editing without integration of a selection marker or leaving any other genomic ‘scars’. The published method involves manual design of the single guide RNA (sgRNA), and digestion of a large plasmid with a problematic restriction enzyme to clone the sgRNA. To increase the efficiency of this approach, we have established and optimized a PCR-based system to clone the sgRNA without restriction enzymes into a plasmid with a dominant natMX 6 (nourseothricin) selection marker. We also provide a web-tool, CRISPR 4 P, to support {{the design of the}} sgRNAs and the primers required for the entire process of seamless DNA deletion. Moreover, we report the preparation of G 1 -synchronized and cryopreserved S. pombe cells, which greatly increases the efficiency and speed for transformations, and may also facilitate standard <b>gene</b> <b>manipulations.</b> Applying this optimized CRISPR/Cas 9 -based approach, we have successfully deleted over 80 different non-coding RNA genes, which are generally lowly expressed, and have inserted 7 point mutations in 4 different genomic regions...|$|R

However, these antitumor agents, sometimes induced incomplete apoptosis or other types of cell death characterized by lack of caspase activation and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, depending on the target cells or the chemical structure of inducers.

40|$|Abstract: The {{relevance}} of animal models of rheumatoid arthritis {{and their relationship}} to the development of antiarthritic therapies is reviewed in depth. Different mechanisms for the induction of experimental arthritis, including infectious processes, non-specific inflammation, autoimmune responses to cartilage components, and genetic manipulation are discussed in context of pathological pathways relevant to rheumatoid arthritis. A variety of species, including rats, mice, dogs, pigs, and monkey are examined for advantages and drawbacks in preclinical development of anti-arthritic agents, and their capacity to mimic critical aspects of arthritis pathology. The history of anti-arthritic therapy from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents to biological response modifiers is placed in context with the evolution of animal models of arthritis. The potential of novel models based upon targeted <b>gene</b> <b>manipulations</b> and corresponding pathway-specific drugs is examined as a new approach to identifying therapies relevant to rheumatoid disease...|$|R

40|$|Conditional <b>gene</b> <b>manipulations</b> in mice are {{increasingly}} popular strategies in biomedical research.

These conditional GEMMs are then bred with one or several transgenic mouse lines expressing a site-specific recombinase, most often the Cre recombinase, in a tissue-specific manner. Conditional GEMMs can only be exploited if Cre transgenic mouse lines are available to generate somatic mutations, and thus the number of Cre transgenic lines has significantly increased over the last 15 years. Once produced, these transgenic lines must be validated for reliable, efficient, and specific Cre expression and Cre-mediated recombination. In this overview, the minimum level of information that is ideally required to validate a Cre-driver transgenic line is first discussed. The vagaries associated with validation procedures are considered next, and some solutions are proposed to assess the expression and activity of constitutive or inducible Cre recombinase before undertaking extensive breeding experiments and exhaustive phenotyping...|$|R

Both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe are amenable to this technique. However, the scarce availability of selectable markers for Sz. pombe hampers the easy use of this technique in this species. Here, we describe the construction of new vectors deriving from the pFA 6 a family, which are suitable for tagging in both yeasts owing to the presence of a nourseothricin-resistance cassette. These plasmids allow various <b>gene</b> <b>manipulations</b> at chromosomal loci, viz.

40|$|Soil {{salinity}} {{has very}} {{adverse effects on}} growth and yield of crop plants. Several salt tolerant wild accessions and cultivars are reported in soybean. Functional genomes of salt tolerant Glycine soja and a salt sensitive genotype of Glycine max were investigated to understand the mechanism of salt tolerance in soybean. For this purpose, four libraries were constructed for Tag sequencing on Illumina platform. We identify around 490 salt responsive genes which included a number of transcription factors, signaling proteins, translation factors and structural genes like transporters, multidrug resistance proteins, antiporters, chaperons, aquaporins etc. The gene expression levels and ratio of up/down-regulated genes was greater in tolerant plants. Translation related genes remained stable or showed slightly higher expression in tolerant plants under salinity stress.

40|$|The {{processes}} that determine an organism 2 ̆ 7 s lifespan {{are complex and}} poorly understood. Yet single <b>gene</b> <b>manipulations</b> and environmental interventions can substantially delay age-related morbidity. In this review, {{we focus on the}} two most potent modulators of longevity: insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) signaling and dietary restriction. The remarkable molecular conservation of the components associated with insulin/IGF- 1 signaling and dietary restriction allow us to understand longevity from a multi-species perspective. We summarize the most recent findings on insulin/IGF- 1 signaling and examine the proteins and pathways that reveal a more genetic basis for dietary restriction. Although insulin/IGF- 1 signaling and dietary restriction pathways are currently viewed as being independent, we suggest that these two pathways are more intricately connected than previously appreciated. We highlight that numerous interactions between these two pathways can occur at multiple levels. Ultimately, both the insulin/IGF- 1 pathway and the pathway that mediates the effects of dietary restriction have evolved to respond to the nutritional status of an organism, which in turn affects its lifespan...|$|R
40|$|The rate {{of aging}} is species-specific, {{indicating}} that aging {{has a strong}} genetic component. Amongst mammals, the synchronization of the aging process suggests the presence of genetic determinants. In addition, single <b>gene</b> <b>manipulations</b> can change the rate of aging and demonstrate how a few genetic factors can regulate aging. There-fore, I propose that aging is regulated by a small set of genetic mechanisms, a single clock. If we can find what these regulatory mechanisms are, then {{instead of trying to}} delay age-related pathologies one by one {{we may be able to}} discover how to delay the entire aging process and most, if not all, of its pathologies. Aging is an intrinsic process of loss of viability and increase in vulnerability. The most accurate method to measure aging is to calculate the rate at which mortality increases with age, such as the mortality rate doubling time (MRDT). Unlike longevity, which is how long an organism is expected to live under ideal circumstances and can vary due to many factors, the MRDT allows us to detect changes in biologica...|$|R
