5|$|Flying {{insects that}} {{parasitise}} common starlings include the louse-fly Omithomya nigricornis and the saprophagous fly Camus hemapterus. The latter species breaks off the feathers of <b>its</b> <b>host</b> and {{lives on the}} fats produced by growing plumage. Larvae of the moth Hofmannophila pseudospretella are nest scavengers, which feed on animal material such as faeces or dead nestlings. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} common starlings, but a better known pest is the brilliant scarlet nematode Syngamus trachea. This worm moves from the lungs to the trachea and may cause <b>its</b> <b>host</b> to suffocate. In Britain, the rook and the common starling are the most infested wild birds. Other recorded internal parasites include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transverses.|$|E

5|$|Its {{estimated}} mass is over 23.04 {{times that of}} Jupiter. Additionally, HIP 78530 b orbits <b>its</b> <b>host</b> star at an estimated average distance of 710 AU, which is 710 times the average distance between the Earth and the Sun assuming the brown dwarf has a circular orbit. The average distance between dwarf planet Pluto and the Sun is 39.482 AU, meaning that HIP 78530 b orbits <b>its</b> <b>host</b> star nearly eighteen times further than Pluto orbits the Sun. In accordance with the data, HIP 78530 b would complete an orbit approximately every 12,000 years, although the actual orbital motion of HIP 78530 b is most likely smaller than 710 AU, {{but it has not}} been directly observed long enough to know definitively.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-14b is {{the sole}} planet {{discovered}} in the Kepler-14 system to date. The planet orbits the primary star in the Kepler-14 binary system. Kepler-14b is estimated to have 8.40 Jupiter masses and 1.136 Jupiter radii. In other words, the planet is 8.4 times more massive than Jupiter, but only 1.136 times Jupiter's size. This equates to a high density, which is measured at 7.1 g cm−3. According to the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia, which calculated Kepler-14b's eccentricity independently, Kepler-14b has a slightly irregular orbit, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.035. Kepler-14b takes approximately 6.79 days to orbit <b>its</b> <b>host</b> star. The mean distance from <b>its</b> <b>host</b> star is about 8.213 times the measured radius of Kepler-14.|$|E

5|$|There is one known {{planet in}} the orbit of WASP-44: WASP-44b. The planet is a Hot Jupiter with a mass of 0.889 Jupiters. Its radius is 1.14 times that of Jupiter. WASP-44b orbits <b>its</b> <b>host</b> star every 2.4238039 days at a {{distance}} 0.03473 AU, approximately 3.47% the mean distance between the Earth and Sun. With an orbital inclination of 86.02º, WASP-44b has an orbit that exists almost edge-on to <b>its</b> <b>host</b> star with respect to Earth. WASPA-44b's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.036, indicating a mostly circular orbit.|$|E
5|$|WASP-15b has {{a mass of}} 0.542 times Jupiter's {{mass and}} a radius that is 1.428 times Jupiter's radius. Due in part to its {{proximity}} to <b>its</b> <b>host</b> star, a distance of 0.0499 AU (7,500,000km), WASP-15b is greatly inflated, with a density of 0.247 g/cm3. Another factor, such as an internal heat source, is suspected to add to this extremely high radius and extremely low density. WASP-15b orbits <b>its</b> <b>host</b> star every 3.7520656 days. It also has an orbital inclination of 85.5º, making it almost edge-on {{as seen from the}} Earth's perspective.|$|E

5|$|WASP-43b is a dense Hot Jupiter {{with a mass}} of 1.78 {{times the}} mass of Jupiter, but a radius of 0.93 times that of Jupiter's. The planet orbits <b>its</b> <b>host</b> star at a mean {{distance}} of 0.0142 AU every 0.813475 days (19.5234 hours); this orbital period, {{at the time of}} WASP-43b's discovery, was the second-shortest orbit yet detected, surpassed only by WASP-19b. In addition, WASP-43b had the closest orbit to <b>its</b> <b>host</b> star (among Hot Jupiters) {{at the time of its}} discovery, comparable only to the Super-Earth planet GJ 1214b and to the planetary candidate orbiting KOI-961. While Hot Jupiters are known to have small orbital periods, planets with exceptionally small periods below three or four days are extremely rare; however, in the case of WASP-43b, the planet's proximity can be explained because <b>its</b> <b>host</b> star has a very low mass. The rarity of systems like that of WASP-43 and its planet suggest that Hot Jupiters do not usually occur around low-mass stars, or that such planets cannot maintain stable orbits around such stars.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its discovery, WASP-43b had an orbital period of {{approximately}} 0.8 days (19.2 hours), the second-shortest orbit ever detected, surpassed only by WASP-19b. In addition, at {{the time of}} discovery, WASP-43b was the most closely orbiting Hot Jupiter known, a phenomenon that can most likely be explained by <b>its</b> <b>host</b> star's low mass.|$|E
