40|$|This work {{presents}} a systematic {{evaluation of the}} effect of dissimilar charging / discharging temperatures on the long-term performance of lithium iron phosphate / graphite based cells by using multi-factor analysis of variance. Specifically, the degradation of prototype pouch cells is presented in a range of charging and discharging temperatures from - 20 °C to + 30 °C, counting a total of 10 temperature combinations. In this manner, not only the effect of charging and discharging temperatures was analyzed, but also the correlations between them. Fitting of the data showed a quadratic relationship of degradation rate with charging temperature, a linear relationship with <b>discharging</b> <b>temperature</b> and a correlation between charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>temperature.</b> Cycling at the charge/discharge temperatures (+ 30 °C, - 5 °C) produced the highest degradation rate, whereas cycling in the range from - 20 °C to + 15 °C, in various charge/discharge temperature combinations, created almost no degradation. It was also found that when Tc is approximately 15 °C the degradation rate is independent of Td. Below Tc + 15 °C lower degradation occurs at higher Td. JRC. C. 1 -Energy Storag...|$|E

40|$|Conventional Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs) using {{ambient air}} as their coolant cannot fully utilize the greater {{temperature}} differential {{available to them}} during the colder months. However, changing the working fluid composition so its boiling temperature matches the ambient temperature as it changes {{has been shown to}} have potential to increase year-round electricity generation. Previous research has assumed that the cycle pressure ratio is able to vary without a major loss in the isentropic efficiency of the turbine. This paper investigates if small scale ORC systems that normally use positive-displacement expanders with fixed expansion ratios could also benefit from this new concept. A numerical model was firstly established, based on which a comprehensive analysis was then conducted. The results showed that it can be applied to systems with positive-displacement expanders and improve their year-round electricity generation. However, such an improvement is less than that of the systems using turbine expanders with variable expansion ratios. Furthermore, such an improvement relies on heat recovery via the recuperator. This is because expanders with a fixed expansion ratio have a relatively constant pressure ratio between their inlet and outlet. The increase of pressure ratio between the evaporator and condenser by tuning the condensing temperature to match colder ambient condition in winter cannot be utilised by such expanders. However, with the recuperator in place, the higher <b>discharging</b> <b>temperature</b> of the expander could increase the heat recovery and consequently reduce the heat input at the evaporator, increasing the thermal efficiency and the specific power.

The properties of water sorption on the composite sorbent were measured in an open environment.

The TES performance of the composite sorbent was investigated in an open-type TES setup equipped with 40 kg composite sorbent pellets. The experimental {{results show that the}} heat <b>discharging</b> <b>temperature</b> of the composite sorbent varied from 30 °C and 45 °C and the TES system was charged efficiently below 90 °C.

These comparisons were carried out via compressor calorimeter tests performed on a compressor designed for refrigerant R- 404 A and having a nominal rated capacity of 23, 500 Btu/hr.

40|$|Hybrid {{heat pumps}} with ammonia/water {{mixtures}} {{are identified as}} one of the most promising high temperature heat pump technologies. They are especially suited for processes with high temperature lifts, flexible regarding capacity control and external changes and enable the use of ammonia at higher temperatures than conventional vapour-compression heat pumps. A two-stage compression/absorption heat pump simulation model was developed in order to evaluate the thermodynamic process for high temperature operation. In simulation scenarios, waste heat was available at 50 &# 176;C and the aim was to heat process water from 100 &# 176;C to 150 &# 176;C. Heat pump performance, temperature levels and pressure levels were some of the key results of the simulations. Secondary, it was developed a simulation model of a finned, annular tube cross-flow absorber in order to assess the dimensions of an absorber for heating air with an ammonia/water mixture. Both models were used in a simulation case where the compression/absorption heat pump was integrated in a spray drying process utilizing waste heat air at 35 &# 176;C. Simulations with the two-stage model showed that the scenarios with high water content in the vapour before the compressor, achieved the highest performances. Circulation ratios were higher, which resulted in a larger fraction of the mixture mass flow went through the compressor circuit, hence smaller compressor work. Although pressure ratios were higher, resulting absorber pressures were significantly lower. Some of the disadvantages with high water content were higher <b>discharge</b> <b>temperatures,</b> although <b>discharge</b> <b>temperatures</b> were high in all scenarios, and considerably lower vapour densities. In simulations were the <b>discharge</b> <b>temperature</b> was limited to 180 &# 176;C, the highest achieved COP was 1. 81, while in simulations with no limitations to the <b>discharge</b> <b>temperature,</b> the highest COP was 2. 53. Moreover, simulation scenarios without limitations to the <b>discharge</b> <b>temperature</b> resulted in lower absorber pressures, hence lower pressure ratios and higher performances. However, it resulted in <b>discharge</b> <b>temperatures</b> as high as 310 &# 176;C. Simulations with a desuperheater showed, provided that the minimum temperature difference between solution and heat sink does not occur at the absorber inlet, that a desuperheater provides no gain. Even when the minimum temperature difference occurs at the absorber inlet, there is only a small gain and it gets smaller with increasing circulation ratios. Dimensioning the absorber gave some unrealistic results in terms of an extreme ratio between absorber height and width/length. Even with the smallest obtained ratio, the height was 10 times the width, and the required surface area was significantly higher than for larger ratios. It is difficult to determine whether the results are due to errors in the simulation model or if it is difficult to obtain a noteworthy result with the simulation parameters. However, it is worth mentioning that the air mass flow rate was 15 times as high as the mixture mass flow rate. In the spray drying simulation case, the heat pump performance was 1. 40 including the fan work. This performance was calculated with no limitation to the <b>discharge</b> <b>temperature</b> and with high water content in the vapour. With more realistic limitations, the performance would have been lower and the required. The required temperature lift in the case may have been somewhat high for the heat pump process. </p...|$|R

In the single-stage operation the condenser of the base unit {{was connected to the}} cooling tower, whereas in the cascade operation it was thermally coupled to the evaporator of the higher-temperature unit via a water stream. Using data obtained from steady-state test runs, the performance characteristics of both systems, namely evaporating and condensing temperatures, refrigerant mass flow rate, compressor power, coecient of performance (COP), compressor <b>discharge</b> <b>temperature,</b> compressor volumetric eciency and the ratio of compressor discharge to suction pressures, were evaluated. The results show that, for a given refrigeration capacity, the cascade system provides a lower evaporating <b>temperature,</b> lower compressor <b>discharge</b> <b>temperature,</b> lower ratio of discharge to suction pressures and higher compressor volumetric eciency at the expense of a lower COP...|$|R
40|$|Ischia Island is the {{emergent}} {{portion of a}} large volcanic complex on the Gulf of Naples (Southern Italy). Ischia volcano has undertaken a complex evolution since 150 ka b. p., with prolonged cycles of effusive and explosive eruptions alternated with quiescence periods (the most recent of which started after the 1302 A. D. Arso eruption). Currently, hot springs (with <b>discharge</b> <b>temperature</b> up to 90 C), fumarolic gas emissions with CO 2 up to 97...|$|R
