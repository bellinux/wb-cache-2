5|$|India {{lies within}} the Indomalaya ecozone and {{contains}} three biodiversity hotspots. One of 17 megadiverse countries, it hosts 8.6% of all mammalian, 13.7% of all avian, 7.9% of all reptilian, 6% of all amphibian, 12.2% of all piscine, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species. About 21.2% of the country's landmass {{is covered by}} forests (tree canopy density >10%), of which 12.2% comprises moderately or very dense forests (tree canopy density >40%). Endemism is high among plants, 33%, and among ecoregions such as the shola forests. Habitat ranges from the tropical rainforest of the Andaman Islands, Western Ghats, and North-East India to the coniferous forest of the Himalaya. Between these extremes lie the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India; the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India; and the babul-dominated thorn forest of the central Deccan and western Gangetic plain. The medicinal neem, widely used in rural Indian herbal remedies, is a key Indian tree.

40|$|While sacred groves (forest {{fragments}} protected {{for religious}} reasons) are widely acknowledged {{to have a}} beneficial effect on biodiversity conservation, the ecological benefits of individual sacred <b>trees</b> remain unknown. <b>Fig</b> <b>trees</b> are present as sacred trees in humandominated landscapes across South Asia and are considered keystone species for wildlife in tropical forests. If frugivores continue to visit <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> in disturbed landscapes, they may deposit seeds of other <b>tree</b> species beneath <b>fig</b> canopies, ultimately facilitating forest regeneration. We studied whether sacred <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> in Tamil Nadu, India can facilitate seed dispersal in human-dominated landscapes. We quantified abundance of sacred <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> at the study site, assessed whether seed-dispersing frugivore visitation to <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> is affected by human disturbance, and compared tree seedling density beneath <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> and open areas. We found that some species of frugivorous birds and bats will visit large <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> in conditions of high human disturbance and that tree seedling density is significantly higher under sacred trees compared to open areas. By promoting frugivore activity, sacred <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> may have a beneficial effect on biodiversity conservation in human-dominated landscapes...|$|R

5|$|The Solomon Islands skink is {{native to}} Solomon Islands archipelago, a group of islands in the {{south-west}} Pacific Ocean. The common subspecies (C. z. zebrata) is found on the islands of Choiseul Island, New Georgia, Isabel, Guadalcanal, Ngela, Malaita, Makira (Solomon Islands), Ugi and Santa Ana. The northern subspecies (C. z. alfredschmidti) is known from the islands of Bougainville and Buka and the Shortland Island Group. Bougainville and Buka are geographically part of the Solomons Archipelago, though politically part of Papua New Guinea. Both subspecies of the Solomon Islands skink are strictly arboreal, usually inhabiting the upper canopy of forested areas throughout its range. It commonly occurs in the strangler <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> (Ficus sp.), provided the epiphytic growth of its several food plants are present. It occurs in trees in semi-cleared areas and cultivated food gardens, again provided its food plants occur there.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{including}} {{trees are}} important in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, and may {{be more or less}} magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras Koks is a tree which grows {{from the start of the}} Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, a story which may perhaps have started from an observation of goose barnacles growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms. Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is supposed to be able to open any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the sacred <b>fig</b> <b>tree</b> under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree.|$|E

Searching Luke, however, we find only the parable of the barren <b>fig</b> <b>tree,</b> in a different point of the narrative.

25|$|It is {{believed}} that the Moreton Bay <b>Fig</b> <b>tree</b> was planted in 1848 to commemorate the roofing of the lodge, possibly following a Northern European custom of placing a small sapling on the roof {{on the day that}} the ridge is set in place.

40|$|Scattered fig (Ficus spp. Moraceae) {{trees are}} {{critically}} important for biodiversity conservation in tropical rural landscapes. By providing large fruit crops, they help maintain seed dispersal networks and facilitate forest restoration. The conservation of <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> scattered across rural landscapes is therefore vital {{for the preservation}} of ecosystem services and biodiversity beyond the borders of protected areas. Given the threats to scattered <b>fig</b> <b>trees,</b> it is increasingly important to identify potentially effective local conservation strategies that accommodate existing perceptions of their value. We used ethnographic techniques to assess the attitudes of villagers towards <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> in the village of Komargoan and its surroundings in Assam, India. As reported for other parts of South Asia, we found <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> have significant sacred status, which included taboos against cutting them down. However, we discovered mixed and sometimes contradictory understandings of the religious attributes of <b>fig</b> <b>trees,</b> which were sometimes believed to be inhabited by gods or ancestral spirits. The benefits most commonly associated with <b>fig</b> <b>trees</b> by interviewees were their aesthetic beauty, large size, and shade during the daytime heat. When the presence of these trees incurred economic costs, their religious, aesthetic, and practical benefits were not sufficient reasons to prevent people from cutting them down, although often saplings would be planted in another place as compensation. Unexpectedly, figs were only planted by respected members of the community, usually older men, who had sufficient social status. Any conservation strategy aiming to sustain the abundance of figs in rural Assam {{is more likely to be}} successful if these cultural views are taken into account. </p...|$|R
