They used drums and rattles in the dances during the ceremonies. Religious men dressed as the kachinas would come down from the mountains and dance among the people during the festival.

25|$|The Chumphon {{route is}} {{unlikely}} {{to have been the}} main attack route as it was even farther south than Alaungpaya's Kuiburi route. It means the Burmese would have had a longer route to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> the Gulf of Siam coast. Without the element of surprise that Alaungpaya enjoyed in the 1760 war, the Burmese invasion force of 1765 would have had to fight more than three months it took Alaungpaya {{to break out of the}} coast. Yet, Maha Nawrahta's army was west of Ayutthaya by December. To be sure, the smaller Burmese army that took Tenasserim could have crossed over at Chumphon, and marched up the coast although the most southerly battles reported by the Burmese were at Ratburi and Phetburi, on the northern coast. At any rate, according to the Burmese sources, Chumphon was not the main attack route.|$|E
25|$|Joe Kinnear set out {{his plan}} for Luton – they were to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> at the first attempt. He oversaw a {{complete}} overhaul of the squad during the summer, building {{a team that was}} Luton's finest for some years. Midfielder Kevin Nicholls signed from Wigan Athletic for £25,000 and would go on to become a key figure in midfield, earning the club captaincy; a role he would hold for the next five years. Australian defender Chris Coyne signed from Dundee, again for a small fee of £50,000. Steve Howard ended the season by winning the Third Division golden boot award with 24 goals. Ending the season with a club-record 12 consecutive wins, Luton travelled to Swansea City at the end of March knowing that a win would guarantee them promotion back to the third tier at the first attempt. They duly won 3–1.|$|E

500|$|Since mid-2004, Zito {{has added}} a two-seam fastball and a cutterslider hybrid to his arsenal. In the 2009 season, this cutter-slider became a {{prominent}} part of his repertoire, being used more frequently than his changeup. Zito's diminished velocity {{at the start of}} the 2007 season (his fastball velocity slowed to [...] ) and loss of command were the key mechanical reasons for his struggles that year, as he more often got behind in the count and had to rely more on his fastball. During the 2009 season, Zito made changes to his delivery, lowering his arm slot from an over the top angle to a three quarters delivery. This change helped his fastball velocity <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> to the [...] range as well as sharpening the break of his curveball. However, in 2011, he was once again in the [...] range with his fastball. In 2012, Zito relied mostly on his two-seam fastball and cutter, and reduced his reliance on the four-seamer, which was the slowest four-seamer in MLB among starting pitchers that year, at [...]|$|E
500|$|When Jim and Pam briefly return home, Jim is {{surprised}} to find Carol Stills (Nancy Carell) showing their house to another couple. Pam comes clean and admits she has been showing the house for two months. She wants to repay Jim for all his romantic gestures and says she wants {{him to go to}} Athleap in Austin, at which point the couple seeing the house make an offer. Jim and Pam go to an after party at the warehouse where they inform an elated Darryl of their plans, with Jim being able to rejoin the company with no change. Pam unveils a new painted mural featuring the history of their branch. A final picture is taken with the employees and the camera crew before the employees <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> to the office for a final toast. Jim and Pam tell Dwight they are quitting, but Dwight fires them instead so he can give them hefty severance packages, as a last gesture of friendship. The employees are {{surprised to find}} Creed, who has been living in Ryan's old closet since faking his death, in the office. Creed sings a song on the guitar for the office before being arrested. The employees give one last round of interviews before leaving, with Pam taking her watercolor of the office building that Michael bought from her in the third-season episode [...] "Business School".|$|E
500|$|Once {{the train}} is loaded and secured, the floor drops and the front bars that block the train from leaving while loading, open. After leaving the station, the train makes a U-turn {{to the left and}} begins to climb the [...] tall chain lift hill. Once riders reach the top, they go through a small pre-drop before {{dropping}} [...] to the left at a 55-degree angle. The train then reaches a top speed of [...] and passes through several fogged Bizarro's S shields. Riders then enter the [...] vertical loop followed by a turn to the right into the [...] diving loop. Upon exiting the diving loop there is a burst of fire shot out {{on each side of the}} track. After the diving loop, the train passes the station and goes through a Zero G roll. The train then goes through the [...] cobra roll. Riders then enter the mid-course brake run which is located next to the lift hill. Similar to the first drop, the train drops to the left and enters a 270-degree helix followed by the two Interlocking corkscrews. The corkscrews interlock around a mist which sprays the riders with water. Riders go through a small dip then enter the final brake run before returning to the station. Once returned, the floors <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> and the bars close back up enabling riders to unload and next ones to load. Following the conclusion of the ride, guests can purchase an on-ride photo which was taken between the cobra roll and zero-g roll.|$|E

60|$|Well, the {{soldiers}} were there close by--there was no use trying to resist--so we followed the servant up; but {{when he tried to}} beguile us into a drawing-room, Livy drew the line; she wouldn't go in. And she wouldn't stay up there, either. She said the princess might come in at any moment and catch us, and it would be too infernally ridiculous for anything. So we went down stairs again--to my unspeakable regret. For it was too darling a comedy to spoil. I was hoping and praying the princess would come, and catch us up there, and that those other Americans who were expected would arrive, and be taken for impostors by the portier, and shot by the sentinels--and then it would all go into the papers, and be cabled all over the world, and make an immense stir and be perfectly lovely. And by that time the princess would discover that we were not the right ones, and the Minister of War would be ordered out, and the garrison, and they would come for us, and there would be another prodigious time, and that would get cabled too, and--well, Joe, I {{was in a state of}} perfect bliss. But happily, oh, so happily, that big portier wouldn't let us out--he was sorry, but he must obey orders--we must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> stairs and wait. Poor Livy--I couldn't help but enjoy her distress. She said we were in a fix, and how were we going to explain, if the princess should arrive before the rightful Americans came? We went up stairs again--laid off our wraps, and were conducted through one drawing room and into another, and left alone there and the door closed upon us.|$|E
