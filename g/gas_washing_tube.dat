The three Carboniferous oil layers {{are characterized by}} “oil in {{the upper and lower}} layers and gas in the middle” in profile and “oil in the west and gas in the east” in plane view. In order to discuss the complex reservoir accumulation mechanisms, based on the petroleum geology and reservoir distribution, we studied the generation history of source rocks, the fault evolution and sealing, the accumulation periods and <b>gas</b> <b>washing,</b> and reconstructed the accumulation process of the TZ 1 –TZ 4 well block. It is concluded that the hydrocarbon enrichment differences of oil layers CIII, CII and CI were caused by multiple sources and multi-period hydrocarbon charging and adjustment. The CII was closely related to CIII, but CI was formed by reservoir adjustment during the Yanshan period and was not affected by <b>gas</b> <b>washing</b> after it was formed. During the Himalayan period, different degrees of <b>gas</b> <b>washing</b> in the east and west led to hydrocarbon enrichment differences on the plane. The Carboniferous accumulation process of two-stage charging and one-stage adjustment is summarized: oil charging during the late Hercynian period is the first accumulation period of CIII and CII; oil reservoirs were adjusted into CI in the Yanshan period; finally <b>gas</b> <b>washing</b> in the Himalayan period is the second accumulation period of CIII and CII, but CI was not affected by <b>gas</b> <b>washing.</b> This complex accumulation process leads to the hydrocarbon enrichment differences in the TZ 1 –TZ 4 well block.|$|R

40|$|There {{is a huge}} lack of dermal uptake {{data for}} chemicals, and it is {{frequent}} with large variations in reported permeability coefficients for chemicals {{with more than one}} data set, showing the need for a new and standardized in vitro method. The overall aim of this thesis was to develop the new method of measuring dermal absorption of chemical vapor using the TGA method. Assessment of dermal absorption by TGA (Study I) Round pieces (ø 8 mm) of pig epidermis were placed on a platinum pan and inserted into the TGA furnace, where a constant temperature (35 ± 0. 01 °C) and humidity (45 % RH) were maintained. The weight change of the skin was readily recorded prior, during and after exposure to an airflow containing known concentrations of chemical vapor (from water, 2 -propanol, methanol and toluene). When no chemical vapor was present the weight of the skin was constant and upon addition of chemical vapor the weight of the skin increased until an equilibrium with the surrounding air was reached. After removal of chemical vapor the skin weight decreased until the baseline weight was reached. The shape of the weight curves was unique for each studied chemical, were the slope and total weight increase reflect the diffusion and skin:air partition coefficients of the studied chemicals, respectively. Vapor generating system (Study II) A computer-controlled, fully automated vapor generating system was created. The chemical vapor was generated by means of bubbling clean, dry air through tailor-made stainless steel chemical containing <b>gas</b> <b>wash</b> bottles, placed in a thermo regulated water bath. Magnetic valves were placed before and after each <b>gas</b> <b>wash</b> bottle to direct the airflow and to prevent back flow, respectively. The performance of a <b>gas</b> <b>wash</b> bottle was tested and close to full saturation was measured using cyclohexanone as test substance. A dedicated computer program was created allowing automated execution of schedules, facilitating precise timing and long time dermal uptake studies using TGA. Development of TGA-specific diffusion model (Study III) A multi compartmental, parallel diffusion model was created using a derived TGA-specific solution to Fick s second law of diffusion. Diffusion and skin:air partition coefficients were obtained by fitting the model to TGA obtained skin weight curves from studies on n-butyl acetate, methanol, 2 -propanol and toluene. Akaikes Information Criterion (AIC) was applied and it was found that a two compartment model was sufficient to describe the weight curves. The first compartment was fast and having a low capacity whereas the second compartment was slower with a higher capacity. Validate TGA method against Franz cells (Study IV) TGA and Franz diffusion cell studies were preformed on pig skin testing dermal penetration of the above mentioned chemicals and n-butanol, cyclohexanone, ethyl benzene, n-hexane, styrene and m-xylene. The Franz cell obtained diffusion coefficients showed good agreement with the faster of the two TGA compartments. In conclusion, skin weight changes were readily recorded when dermal exposure to chemical vapor was studied using the TGA method. Diffusion and partition coefficients were obtained by fitting a TGA-specific two compartment model to the recorded weight curves. A good agreement was found when comparing the TGA obtained diffusion coefficients with those from Franz cell experiments...|$|R

For this purpose, a comprehensive analytical characterisation of dialyzate, diluat and concentrate was made. The liquor parameters determined in the test series were investigated to find a correlation between electric conductivity and pH value, on the one hand, and HCL or Na_ 2 SO_ 4 concentration, on the other hand. With {{a high degree of}} certitude, a clear correlation between the electric conductivity and the HCL or Na_ 2 SO_ 4 content of all three partial streams was found. This allows to use electric conductivity as a continuously measured value for measuring and controlling applications,to pursue the separation efficiency of electrodialysis. Also for highest occurring concentrations in the concentrate the correlation is linear. The clear correlation found between HCL or Na_ 2 SO_ 4 content and electric conductivity permitted outlining and implementation of an industrially applicable conductivity measuring system. In a first stage of electrodialysis studies deposits on the membranes occur, which were identified as PbSO_ 4 and CaS 0 _ 4. These deposits could be eliminated by microfiltration and ion exchange treatment of the dialyzat liquor. Thus, it can be stated the aptitude in continuous duty both of electrodialysis processes. Membrane poisons such as As, Sb or Se, typical for the studied processes of electrodialysis, could not be detected after introduction of ion exchange treatment.

The original Ag speciation in the textiles was found to vary greatly between different materials with Ag(0), AgCl, Ag 2 S, Ag–phosphate, ionic Ag and other species identified. Furthermore, within the same textile a number of different species were found to coexist.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the development of}} the multiple-breat h-helium washout (MBHW) measurement for lung-function study. Multiple-breath washout (MBW) has been regarded as a sensitive technique to study the ventilation inhomogeneity in conducting or acinar airways. The tracer <b>gas</b> <b>washed</b> out from the lungs breath by breath is monitored. By analysing the concentration of the tracer gas versus the expired tidal volumes, the washout results provide two indices Scond and Sacin which reflect the degree of ventilation inhomogeneity. Scond is the increasing rate of the noramlised phase III slopes breath by breath while the Sacin is the normalised phase III slope from the first breath with the subtraction of Scond. The higher Scond value the greater ventilation inhomogeneity in the conductive airways while the higher Sacin value the greater ventilation inhomogeneity in the acinar airways. Traditionally, nitrogen is used as the tracer <b>gas,</b> <b>washed</b> out by the pure oxygen in a multiple-breath-nitrogen washout (MBNW) measurement. It is usually chosen because it is the gas we normally breathe and has no direct influence on physiology unlike oxygen. In this study, 4 He gas is used as the tracer gas instead. Since helium is less dense and has higher diffusivity than nitrogen, it is believed that {{it will be able to}} reach deeper into our lungs in a given time. Therefore, helium washout may provide more ventilation information especially in the small airways. In our MBHW system, a quartz tuning fork with a resonant frequency 32768 Hz is used as the gas density sensor. The resonant frequency of the tuning fork is linearly related to the surrounding gas density. The helium concentr ation is given by eliminating all other gas components and calculating it from the tuning fork signal. Considering other components of our expiration, the carbon dioxide is detected by the infrared sensor, and the water is filtered out by a trap. We have performed the washout measurements on 11 volunteers, three of them have been diagnosed having mild lung diseases (asthma), two are smokers, and the other five are normal healthy people. The peak expiratory flow is also measured for each subject. The single breath MBHW curves from asthmatic people have higher normalised phase III slopes and higher Scond or Sacin values. This shows a greater conductive or acinar ventilation inhomogeneity in asthmatics’ lungs. The lung clearance washout curves are fitted with a summation of two exponential curves which represent two compartments with different ventilation rates. The compartment with higher decay rate represents the better-ventilated compartment and the other one is the poorly-ventilated compartment. Subjects with larger proportion of poorly-ventilated compartments have a lower peak expiratory flow rate compared to the predicted values. A 2. 2 -litre lung model has been built. A loud speaker has been used to simulate the movement of the diaphragm. MBHW measurements have been performed on the lung model which has a 0 - to 4 -generation dichromatic structure.
