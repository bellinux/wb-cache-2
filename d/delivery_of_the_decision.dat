40|$|This paper {{explores the}} value of science and {{technology}} studies (STS) to management education. The work draws on an ethnographic study of second year management undergraduates studying decision making. The nature and <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> making module is outlined and {{the value of}} STS is demonstrated in terms of both teaching method and module content. Three particular STS contributions are identified and described: the social construction of technological systems; actor network theory; and ontological politics. Affordances and sensibilities are identified for each contribution and a discussion is developed that illustrates how these versions of STS are put to use in management education. It is concluded that STS has a pivotal role to play in critical management (education) and in the process offers opportunities for new forms of managin...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} program is to develop and deliver a procedure guide of low cost methodologies to analyze and correct problems with stripper wells experiencing abnormal production declines. A study group of wells will provide data to determine the historic frequency {{of the problem of}} abnormal production declines in stripper gas wells and the historic frequency of the causes of the production problems. Once the most frequently occurring causes of the production problems are determined, data collection forms and decision trees will be designed to cost-effectively diagnose these problems and suggest corrective action. Finally, economic techniques to solve the most frequently occurring problems will be researched and implemented. These systematic methodologies and techniques will increase the efficiency of problem assessment and implementation of solutions for stripper gas wells. This third quarterly technical report was to describe the data reduction and methodologies to develop decision trees, identify cost effective techniques to solve the most frequently experienced problems and then apply the methodology to a group of wells where recent problems have developed. Further, this third quarterly technical report was to describe the data reduction and methodologies to select the two wells with the greatest potential for increase and also having the most frequently occurring problem, and evaluate the results of the methodology and the implemented procedure. However, preparation and analysis of the decision trees is more complex than initially anticipated due to the combination of problems rather than identifiable individual problems. Therefore, this portion of the study is still in progress. We have requested and been granted verbal approval for a six month no cost extension to allow more time to thoroughly investigate this portion of the study. The <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> trees will be included in future technical reports. Work on the other tasks to be completed in this third quarterly report could not begin until completion of the decision trees...|$|E

The Be 3/5 was something of a stopgap offered by Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon (MFO) because they felt that the requirements required for the Gotthard Railway could not be fulfilled at the time. As the MFO did not feel that it could produce a freight locomotive with six drive-axles, a smaller version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BLS Be 5/7 was offered. This meant that the locomotive did not fulfil the SBB specifications for the Gotthard line; it was too weak and, compared with the A 3/5 steam locomotives, too slow.

30|$|In all {{subsequent}} analyses, I take the year 1982 {{to be the}} first year for which fertility outcomes in Miami are likely to be affected by the immigration shock. The year 1982 therefore represents <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-treatment period. While it is possible that fertility outcomes might have been affected in as early as 1981, <b>the</b> likelihood <b>of</b> this is low. The reason is that if a respondent reports having a birth in the last 12  months during the 1981 survey (conducted in June 1981), this would mean that the birth(s) must have occurred between the period July 1980 and June 1981. Because it takes an average of 42  weeks (or 9.7  months) between <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> conception and <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to have <b>the</b> child must have been made, at latest, between September 1979 and August 1980. Although the Mariel immigrants arrived in Miami between May 1980 and September 1980, slightly overlapping with this period, it is unlikely that either perceived job market security or <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> living space and goods complementary to childbearing would have adjusted fast enough so as to alter the childbearing outcomes reflected in the 1981 data. In any case, to be sure, robustness checks were conducted in all analyses to see if the results changed in any way when 1981 and 1983 were instead taken to be <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-treatment period. The results remained practically unchanged when these alternative years were taken to be the years in which the treatment occurred. I therefore take 1982 to be the treatment year.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{high rate}} <b>of</b> {{maternal}} mortality reported in The Gambia {{is influenced by}} many factors, such as difficulties in accessing quality healthcare and facilities. In addition, socio-cultural practices in rural areas may limit the resources available to pregnant women, resulting in adverse health consequences. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study is to}} depict the gender dynamics in a rural Gambian context by exploring the social and cultural factors affecting maternal health. Five focus group discussions that included 50 participants (aged 15 - 30 years, with at least one child) and six in-depth interviews with traditional birth attendants were conducted to explore perceptions of maternal health issues among rural women. The discussion was facilitated by guides focusing on issues such as how the women perceived their own physical health during pregnancy, difficulties in keeping themselves healthy, and health-related problems during pregnancy and delivery. The data resulting from the discussion was transcribed verbatim and investigated using a qualitative thematic analysis. In general, rural Gambian women did not enjoy privileges in their households when they were pregnant. <b>The</b> duties expected <b>of</b> them required pregnant women to endure heavy workloads, with limited opportunities for sick leave and almost nonexistent resources to access prenatal care. <b>The</b> division <b>of</b> labor between {{men and women in the}} household was such that women often engaged in non-remunerable field work with few economic resources, and their household duties during pregnancy were not alleviated by either their husbands or <b>the</b> other members <b>of</b> polygamous households. At <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to receive care by trained personnel was often beyond the women's control, resulting in birth-related complications. Our findings suggest that despite women's multiple roles in the household, their positions are quite unfavorable. The high maternal morbidity and mortality rate in The Gambia is related to practices associated with gender inequality...|$|R
40|$|Elsewhere at {{this meeting}} we present {{functional}} magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements in both monkey and human subjects performing a simple value-based decision making task. These data reveal a correspondence in <b>the</b> network <b>of</b> brain areas activated in the two species in this foraging task. Most interesting among these are areas whose fMRI BOLD signal correlates with variations in local reward rate, a task variable known to account for variability in behavioral choices and neural activity in similar games (e. g. Sugrue et al, Science, 2004). In particular, the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) in both species showed strong local reward rate modulation. These fMRI results prompted us to record from single neurons in monkey ACC in a similar foraging task. Preliminary results from these experiments confirm that ACC neurons are strongly modulated in this task, with individual cells encoding a variety of task related signals. These include a prelude response that peaks prior to option selection and scales with local reward rate, and responses related to two highly salient task events - <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> rewards, and <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to switch between the competing reward sources. Interestingly, a majority of neurons recorded to date respond to rewards with a decrease in their firing rate, and show a negative encoding of local reward rate. We compare the sign and time course of these electrophysiological responses with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding BOLD signal. Several theories have emphasized a specific role for ACC in the processing and prediction of errors and conflict (e. g. Brown Braver, Science, 2005). More recently, this emphasis has been challenged and a more general role for ACC suggested, in which it integrates both errors and rewards over time to develop a representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> competing options (Kennerley et al., Nat. Neurosci., 2006). In our task, subjects must forage for rewards in a dynamic and probabilistic environment where there are no 'correct' or 'error' responses. Our finding that BOLD and single unit responses in the ACC are modulated by local reward rate in this task is consistent with a more general conception of ACC function. Moreover, <b>the</b> high proportion <b>of</b> ACC neurons that exhibit a negative encoding of reward and reward rate may explain why error processing has been overemphasized in earlier accounts of ACC activation. This work demonstrates that fMRI and electrophysiology in the awake behaving monkey provide complementary tools for identifying and investigating the neural signals responsible for value-based decision making and suggest <b>the</b> utility <b>of</b> this combined approach in studying similar complex cognitive phenomena...|$|R

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken among 843 antenatal clients at Agbongbon/Orayan primary health care centers (PHCs), Adeoyo Maternity Hospital (SHC), and UCH Ibadan (THC), representing the three different levels of health care in Nigeria, ie, primary, secondary, and tertiary. Results: <b>The</b> proportion <b>of</b> women aware of MDCS was 39. 6 %. Predictors of awareness were education and type of health facility. Women from THC and those with tertiary education and above were more likely to be aware of MDCS than others (P = 0. 001). Doctors were major sources of information on MDCS (30. 8 %) as well as friends (24. 3 %). Common reasons reported for MDCS were fear of labor pains (68. 9 %), and fear of poor labor outcome (60. 1 %), and fear of fecal (20. 2 %) and urinary incontinence (16. 8 %). More women from the THC than other facilities believed that requests for MDCS should be granted (P &lt; 0. 001). However, willingness to request MDCS was low (6. 6 %). More than 50 % of those willing to request MDCS would likely be criticized, mainly by their husbands. On multiple logistic regression, respondents at the THC were significantly more likely than those at the SHC or the PHCs to request cesarean section and to favor a woman&rsquo;s right of autonomy to choose her mode <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> Conclusion: <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> for MDCS is a difficult one, because willingness is low and criticism by partners of those who choose MDCS is high. Provision of epidural anesthesia and improved safety <b>of</b> vaginal <b>delivery</b> is recommended. This may prevent Nigerian women from making a difficult choice for MDCS based on fear of pain and poor labor outcome. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male partner should be taken into consideration in order to make sustainable policies or guidelines for MDCS in developing countries.
