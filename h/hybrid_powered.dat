40|$|Abstract— 1 With the {{miniaturization}} {{of electronic}} devices, small size but high capacity {{power supply system}} {{appears to be more}} and more important. A <b>hybrid</b> <b>power</b> source, which consists of a fuel cell (FC) and a rechargeable battery, has the advantages of long lifetime and good load following capabilities. In this paper, we propose the schematic of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>power</b> supply system, that can be integrated on a chip compatible with present CMOS process. Besides, considering the problem of maximizing the on-chip fuel cell’s lifetime, we propose a modified dynamic power management (DPM) algorithm for on-chip fuel cell based <b>hybrid</b> <b>power</b> system in wireless sensor node design. Taking the wireless sensor node <b>powered</b> by this <b>hybrid</b> <b>power</b> system as an example, we analyze the improvement of the FC-Bat <b>hybrid</b> <b>power</b> system.
