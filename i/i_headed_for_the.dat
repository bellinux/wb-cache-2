And to this day I have a half belief that they understood, not the word but the feeling behind it; for they grew quiet after a time and looked out with wide-open, {{wondering}} eyes. Then I dodged out of sight, jumped the fallen log to throw them off the scent should they come out, crossed the brook, and glided out of sight into the underbrush. Once safely out of hearing <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> straight <b>for</b> <b>the</b> open, a few yards away, where the blasted stems of the burned hillside showed faintly through the green of the big woods, and climbed, and looked, and changed my position, till at last I could see the fallen tree under whose roots my little innocents were hiding.|$|R
5000|$|... "Then the Sabres {{changed to}} another tactic. Individual pairs {{of their most}} {{experienced}} pilots would sit off to the side, and when combat was joined would pounce on the trailing aircraft of our group, and frequently shoot them down. ... My flight was flying to reinforce the strike group in the lead battle. As {{we got to the}} place of combat, the enemy were just finishing up moving out over the sea. Our side was also running out of fuel, and they were heading for home. As we got there, we could see an eight of Sabres coming right at us at the same altitude. Without thinking, I gave the command “Let’s attack them” and turned at a nearly 90 degree bank to wind up 600 meters behind this group. It was just as I got the leader in my sights and gave him a burst that I got a sensation of that something was behind me. That sensation made me turn right and look behind me, and what it was I do not know to this day. Perhaps I had seen something. But inexplicable as it was, there I now saw less than 100 meters behind me the huge nose of a Sabre and the blasts and tracers of its six machine guns firing at me. Without thinking, {{in the space of a}} few hundredths of a second I reacted automatically, and my MiG momentarily did a half roll, dropping into a dive. While in the dive, I looked back and saw a group consisting of three Sabres right behind me in a dive. ...I could have initiated a dive, but I have been told that the Sabre was heavier than the MiG, so it should dive better. Because of that, to dive wasn't an option. Then I saw right in front of me a cluster of saving clouds. My only choice was to head my aircraft towards one of them. Once inside the cloud, I made a very sharp turn of 90° to the left, I got out of the clouds and performed a right turn. I supposed that the lead Sabre would thought that my MiG kept on diving straight after getting out of the cloud. And that was exactly what happened. Now, below me, there were these three Sabres, which were looking for me downwards. Without losing not even a second, I jumped them. I have turned the wits. Now it was my turn to attack.But somehow they spotted me and immediately they split: the wingmen performed a diving turn to the left, and the leader a climbing right turn. This tactic allow them to neutralize my attack and to transform me into their prey: it was a trap. Whichever one I attacked, I would be forced to turn my tail to the others and then they would get me under fire. What was I to do? I could climb up and give battle, but I did not want to get into this interesting and advantageous situation: if you are going to do battle with strong pilots, with the Sabre wing commander, you had better be in a better position.It is true that they were 3, but it didn't matter to me: I was very self-confident in my skills and my MiG. But now, I should decide fast who I shall to attack. Should I attack the pair which was diving, or the Sabre which was climbing? If I would jumped the first ones, the latter would dive after me and he would shoot me down. That's why I choose the later, because it was closer and was making a climbing turn to the right. So, I dived and soon I put myself behind him, I aimed, and at a distance of about 600 meters, I opened up. To slow down and to hold my fire until to be closer it was impossible, because the two remaining Sabres could catch me. My shells struck the Sabre. Evidently, some of the projectiles should hit it close to the engine, because the aircraft began to leave a trail of dark-gray smoke. The Sabre began to descend, and later entered in a steep dive.I could not see all the fall, because when I looked back, I saw a couple of Sabres at 500 meters. A little bit more, and both would open fire with their 12,7 mm (0,50") machineguns.Evidently, that was when I made a mistake. I should increase my angle of climbing and drag the Sabres to high altitude, where the MiG had the advantage. But I came to that conclusion only a long time later. At that time I reversed my heading, passed over the Sabres and in a slight dive I led my aircraft to a small group of clouds. Once there I turned to the right and went I got out of them, I started a ‘Boyevoy Razvorot Turn’, a climbing turn with a roll angle of 40-50° to the left, but I didn’t found the Sabres below where I expect them to be, but behind at my left. ...I threw my aircraft in a dive, but instead of a sharp pull-up into a climb I began to slowly roll my aircraft into a flat dive. The Sabres, who didn’t expect that, stayed in the height, far above and behind.I dived to the right towards the hydroelectric station over the Yalu river station is referred in the Russian cartography as Suphun hydroelectric station, and as Suiho Dam/Reservoir in the American one - Note of the authors. This huge reservoir had a dam of 300 meters height and a power station which provided energy not only to half of Korea but also the whole North-East of China. Precisely it was the main target we should protect. Besides us, their defense consisted in a dozen of anti-aircraft batteries, which had the order to shoot at any airplane which get closer to the dam.I had the hope that the gunners of these batteries would help me to get these Sabres out of my tail. And that was what happened: the gunners accomplished their order to open fire at any intruder, and in front of me it appeared a dark cloud caused by the detonation of the anti-aircraft shells. I didn’t want to evade that cloud, because the Sabres would reduce the distance and they would shoot me down. At that moment I preferred to eventually die in the hands of my fellow gunners, rather than the bullets of the Sabres, so <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> very center of a cloud. The aircraft punched into the cloud. Once inside and away from the shell bursts I immediately swung the aircraft from side to side, up and down. Grabbing the stick, I pulled back on it. The results were that the wings fluttered a bit.But after several tens of seconds passed, suddenly I was once again out in the sunshine. The aircraft had punched through the black cloud. Behind and below me were the dam and the reservoir. Off to the left I could see the departing Sabres, having lost me in the cloud and perhaps figured I was dead. Following me had proven to be useless, the sea was near, and not wanting a new fight, even though I had come close to passing out from the stress. In order to not lose consciousness I focused my attention in front of me and pinched the arteries in my neck, as I did not want the blood to leave my head. It was far easier for the Sabre pilots to take this stress - they had a special anti-G suit which, when it sensed increased stress on the pilot, filled with air and, grasping him tightly, prevented the blood from leaving his head. Up until then our designers had never thought of such an idea.I circled the airfield a couple of times, landed and then, taxiing over to the hardstand, saw my wingmen. They, having lost me during the sharp turn, continued to go after the eight Sabres, but when they got to the coastline had to turn back, searched for me, and not finding me, returned to the airfield.Subsequent examination of my gun camera footage showed good hits on the Sabre. Ground command reported where it had impacted.” ...|$|E
40|$|Saturday evening (24 July 1999) I {{heard the}} news {{that there had been}} a plane crash in Fiji and that 17 people had been killed, amongst them five (now six) Australians. Two weeks ago I left Fiji in high spirits after {{attending}} the Imagining Oceania conference at the University of the South Pacific.

I tried to put possible identities to the brief descriptions of the other Australians on board and ended up figuring that I didn 2 ̆ 7 t know any of them. But there was still the issue of the remaining 12 passengers about whom no information was given in the papers. I felt frustrated and angry. Didn 2 ̆ 7 t they matter? It is not as if the crash happened in a place in any sense remote from Australia. The historical, political and cultural relationships that bind Australia to Fiji are incredibly strong and rich. In part, these continue to be expressed in a steady flow of people, goods and ideas between the two countries. You have only to look at the people and their packages arriving on an Air Pacific flight in Sydney or Nadi airports to be reminded of this. So why wasn 2 ̆ 7 t this expressed in at least some reference to the other 12, even if only to say that no information was yet available...|$|E
40|$|The amazing {{world of}} natural history made its first impact on me during World War I 1 on the {{tropical}} island of Barbados. My Scottish father had become manager of the British Union Oil Company there. a srnall outfit that evplorcd {{for oil and gas}} on the island and refined crude oil from Venezuela. I had arrived in Barbados in Api-il of 1939, and with the outbreak of war and appearance of German U-boats in the region, my family became trapped on the island. As a result. I spent seven of my foi-mative years in a house in the tropics that had a golf cousse at the back and the emerald Caribbean Sea a short distance in front. This is where i t all began. The golf course became my hunting ground for butterflies and bird and reptile eggs. What a challenge i t was to try to net those elusive butterflies or reach a nest way out on a thin limb. Molluscs were also highly sought after. Sunrise Tellins (Tellirm radiata), which we called "auroras " because of their radiating colors, were a special prize. To capture them, I had to pump holes in the shallow back-reef sand with my feet until I could feel one of these slippery bivalves and dive i t up. When slit open and spread out to dry, they resembled butterflies. About the time I started school, I met the "ultimate collector, " Dr Alfred Senn. the British Union Oil Company's geologist. I used to spend hours after school watching him picking microfossils- mostly foraminifera, I think- out of samples and filing them in endless rows of small vials. This was the Iife for me: 1 decided then and there to become an oil company geologist. When the war ended, my father, convinced that an 1 1 -year old who was spending all his spare time in trees or in the sea was simply not taking life seriously enough, decided to ship me off to boarding school in Scotland. There I was expected to develop character and apply myself to more serious studies. So in 1946, still set on becoming an oil company geologist, <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> land of chilblains.

We had just floundered and flopped round a bend, when I saw an islet, a mere grassy hummock of bright green, in the middle of the stream. It was the only thing of the kind; but as we opened the reach more, I perceived it was the head of a long sandbank, or rather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of the river. They were discolored, just awash, and the whole lot was seen just under the water, exactly as a man's backbone is seen running down the middle of his back under the skin. Now, as far as I did see, I could go to the right or to the left of this. I didn't know either channel, of course. The banks looked pretty well alike, the depth appeared the same; but as I had been informed the station was on the west side, <b>I</b> naturally <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> western passage.|$|R

Not unlike the salmon, I found myself only half {{consciously}} following the vestigial traces of wagon trains that brought my father’s pioneering family to Oregon in the mid- 1800 s. And when I finally arrived, <b>the</b> first place <b>I</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> was <b>the</b> magnificent overlook above Crown Point and the Columbia River Gorge. The Pacific Northwest is {{a place where you can}} feel geologic scale and catch the rumors of upheaval and transformation. It is a landscape that relo-cates us in a larger relationship than human to human and still speaks the language of universe, time, and immensity. Within five years of making this area my home, I had trembled before my first sight of salmon spawning, their reddened bodies ripped and shredded, half out of water, yet still going in this libidinal tenacity of life. I witnessed the uncanny quieting of a solar eclipse as shortly after dawn the darkness returned to the cacophony of animal sounds, then plummeted to the silence of beginnings. I inhaled our sobering interconnectedness in the aftermath of Mt. St. Helens, as towns miles away felt the weight of its ash falling on their doorsteps. Yet I lived rather safely cocooned in these spectacular surroundings, no...|$|R

I got up, and seeing he hadn't finished, I started off full tilt with my arms doubled up over my face. But he ran on those gawky legs of his faster than a racehorse, and kept landing out at me with sledge hammer kicks, and bringing his pickaxe down {{on the back of}} my <b>head.</b> <b>I</b> made <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lagoon, and went in up to my neck. He stopped at <b>the</b> water, <b>for</b> he hated getting his feet wet, and began to make a shindy, something like a peacock's, only hoarser. He started strutting up and down the beach. I'll admit I felt small to see this blessed fossil lording it there. And my head and face were all bleeding, and--well, my body just one jelly of bruises.|$|R
