500|$|A {{media circus}} ensued, with Smith being interviewed by <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> <b>and</b> Johnny Carson, among others, and with nightly reports {{by the major}} American networks.

Smith shared a dormitory with nine other girls, and spent her time there swimming, talking and learning Russian songs and dances. While there, she made many friends, including Natasha Kashirina from Leningrad, a fluent English speaker.|$|R
50|$|Rohde's capture was not {{initially}} admitted by the Bosnian Serb authorities, who gave conflicting answers {{as to whether}} he had been detained and where he was being held. Five days after he was taken prisoner, the Bosnian Serb news agency issued a statement on his capture. The US Government subsequently brought to bear intense diplomatic pressure to release him. A key role was played by Kati Marton, an author and journalist married to the US envoy Richard Holbrooke, who was negotiating with the Serbian president Slobodan Milošević to end the Bosnian War. Marton, who was at the time the chairwoman of the Committee to Protect Journalists, intervened repeatedly during the talks that led to the Dayton Agreement to persuade Milošević to use his influence to secure Rohde's release. The US Secretary of State Warren Christopher was also involved in pressing for Rohde's release at the Dayton talks. A variety of other political and journalistic figures were also involved in campaigning on Rohde's behalf, including Senator Bob Dole, Peter Jennings, <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel,</b> <b>and</b> David Frost. Rohde was subsequently pardoned by order of the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadžić in what Karadžić characterized as a goodwill gesture.|$|R

50|$|McFadden {{became an}} anchor of Primetime in 2004 and, having {{previously}} substituted <b>for</b> <b>Ted</b> <b>Koppel</b> on several occasions, an anchor of Nightline on November 28, 2005, along with Martin Bashir and Terry Moran, following the longtime anchor's final broadcast. Bashir left the program due to fallout from credibility problems from the disputed and controversial reports on singer Michael Jackson {{and was replaced}} by Bill Weir in 2010. The three tended to anchor in shifts, leading the show by themselves every third night. While Nightline was threatened with cancellation in 2002 under Koppel's long form journalism format, it saw a resurgence in its ratings and prominence after switching to more celebrity topics, pop culture and entertainment news, often competing for higher numbers with the Late Show with David Letterman. As anchor, McFadden conducted a number of significant interviews including ones with celebrities such as Clint Eastwood and Paul McCartney, past and present world leaders such as Pervez Musharraf and Tony Blair, and five with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.|$|R
