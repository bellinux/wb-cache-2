500|$|It {{was agreed}} that RAAF {{operations}} during the Emergency would be {{directed by the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) through Air Headquarters Malaya (later No.224 Group RAF). The British also wanted the Australian squadrons attached to an RAF wing. However, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal George Jones, was mindful of repeating the experience of World WarII, when RAAF units and personnel based in Britain had been absorbed by the RAF, rather than operating as a national group led by high-ranking Australian officers. He therefore decided that Nos.1 and 38 Squadrons should be formed into a [...] "composite" [...] organisation (one made up of disparate elements such as bomber, fighter, or reconnaissance units) and administered by an overarching RAAF headquarters, and put this requirement to the British Air Ministry. The Air Ministry agreed, and No.90 (Composite) Wing was <b>duly</b> <b>established</b> at Richmond on 10July 1950, {{under the command of}} Group Captain Paddy Heffernan.|$|E

[...] He became the youngest player – 17 years and 124 days – ever {{to play for the}} senior side, though the record was broken by Alberto Rivera later that same season. On 29 October 1994, in an away game against Real Zaragoza at La Romareda, he created a goal for strike partner Iván Zamorano, heralding the demise of Butragueño in the process. The very next week, Raúl scored his first goal in his second senior game on a home debut against Madrid rivals and former youth club Atlético Madrid in a bitter derby match. <b>Duly</b> <b>establishing</b> himself as a fixture in the first team, Raúl registered a total of nine goals in 28 appearances to help Real Madrid win the 1994–95 league championship in his first season.|$|R

60|$|No doubt Guicciardini is as mistaken in this {{as in many}} another matter, for {{the letter}} written from Spoleto expresses his regret that, on the {{occasion}} of his passage through Florence (on his way from Pisa to Spoleto), he should not have had time to visit Piero, particularly as there was a matter upon which he desired urgently to consult with him. He recommends to Piero his faithful Remolino, whose ambition it is to occupy the chair of canon law at the University of Pisa, and begs his good offices in that connection. That Juan Vera, Cesare's preceptor and the bearer of that letter, took back a favourable answer is highly probable, for in Fabroni's Hist. Acad. Pisan we find this Remolino <b>duly</b> <b>established</b> as a lecturer on canon law in the following year.|$|E
60|$|The Arabins {{after their}} {{marriage}} went abroad {{for a couple}} of months, according to the custom in such matters now <b>duly</b> <b>established,</b> and then commenced their deanery life under good auspices. And nothing can be more pleasant than the present arrangement of ecclesiastical affairs in Barchester. The titular bishop never interfered, and Mrs. Proudie not often. Her sphere is more extended, more noble, and more suited to her ambition than that of a cathedral city. As long as she can do what she pleases with the diocese, she is willing to leave the dean and chapter to themselves. Mr. Slope tried his hand at subverting the old-established customs of the close, and from his failure she had learnt experience. The burly chancellor and the meagre little prebendary are not teased by any application respecting Sabbath-day schools, the dean is left to his own dominions, and the intercourse between Mrs. Proudie and Mrs. Arabin is confined to a yearly dinner given by each to the other. At these dinners Dr. Grantly will not take a part, but he never fails to ask for and receive a full account of all that Mrs. Proudie either does or says.|$|E
60|$|Well, then, the Pall Mall Gazette being <b>duly</b> <b>established</b> and Arthur Pendennis's merits {{recognised}} as a flippant, witty, and amusing critic, {{he worked}} away hard every week, preparing reviews of such works as {{came into his}} department, and writing his reviews with flippancy certainly, but with honesty, and {{to the best of}} his power. It might be that a historian of threescore, who had spent {{a quarter of a century}} in composing a work of which our young gentleman disposed in the course of a couple of days' reading at the British Museum, was not altogether fairly treated by such a facile critic; or that a poet who had been elaborating sublime sonnets and odes until he thought them fit for the public and for fame, was annoyed by two or three dozen pert lines in Mr. Pen's review, in which the poet's claims were settled by the critic, as if the latter were my lord on the bench and the author a miserable little suitor trembling before him. The actors at the theatres complained of him wofully, too, and very likely he was too hard upon them. But there was not much harm done after all. It is different now, as we know; but there were so few great historians, or great poets, or great actors, in Pen's time, that scarce any at all came up for judgment his critical desk. Those who got a little whipping, got what in the main was good for them; not that the judge was any better or wiser than the persons whom he sentenced, or indeed ever fancied himself so. Pen had a strong sense of humour and justice, and had not therefore an overweening respect for his own works; besides, he had his friend Warrington at his elbow--a terrible critic if the young man was disposed to be conceited, and more savage over Pen than ever he was to those whom he tried at his literary assize.|$|E

Many private canal branches were constructed to help businesses. One such link, known as ‘Gilpin’s Arm’, went to the Pelsall Ironworks.
