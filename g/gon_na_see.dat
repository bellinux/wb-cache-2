5000|$|Then, {{there is}} the idea that Nara is a loan word from Korean nara (나라 : country, nation, kingdom). This idea was put forward by a {{linguist}} Matsuoka Shizuo. However, almost nothing about the Old Korean language is known today. The first written attestation of a word ancestral to Modern Korean nara is as late as the 15th century, such as in Yongbieocheonga(1447), [...] Wolinseokbo (月印釋譜. 1459), or Beophwagyeongeonhae (法華經諺解. 1463), and {{there is no evidence that}} proves the word already existed as far back as the 7th century. These 15th-century books used narah (나랗), an old form of nara in Korean, and its older form might be reconstructed *narak. American linguist Christopher I. Beckwith infers the Korean narak derives from the late Middle Old Chinese 壌 (*nrak, earth), from early *narak, and has no connection with Goguryoic and Japanese <b>na.</b> (<b>See</b> also the next theory.) Kusuhara et al. also points out this hypothesis cannot account for the fact there are lots of places named Nara, Naru and Naro besides this Nara.|$|R
