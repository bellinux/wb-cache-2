40|$|Abstract. The {{cumulative}} incidence function provides intuitive summary informa-tion about competing risks data. Via a mixture decomposition of this function, we study covariate {{effects on the}} marginal probability of developing a particular cause of failure {{at a given time}} point without specifying the corresponding failure time distribution. Sev-eral inference methods are constructed based on two principles of handling missing data due to censoring, namely the imputation approach and the weighting approach. Our work extends part of the results in Fine (1999) and Wang (2003). Large sample prop-erties of the proposed estimators are derived and their finite sample performances are examined via simulations. For illustrative purposes, the proposed methods are applied to the well-known Heart Transplant data and is compared with the analysis of Larson and <b>Dinse</b> (1985) which was developed under the framework of a mixture model...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{problem of}} {{establishing}} whether {{the geometry of}} a nonplanar flexible radical may be altered when going from the isotropic phase to the nematic mesophase of a liquid crystalline solvent has received attention in two recent papers (1, 2). Falle and Luckhurst (1) examined the triphenylmethyl radical, studying the temperature dependence of the proton coupling constants in the nematic mesophase of 4, 4 '- dimethoxyazoxybenzene. By lowering the temperature {{they found that the}} ortho and para splittings decrease initially, pass through a minimum, and finally increase. The explanation of this unusual behavior, which cannot be due only to the increased alignment in the mesophase, was found in the flexible geometry of the radical by proposing that the solute molecules undergo a deformation by the liquid crystalline solvent towards a more planar conformation. Haustein, <b>Dinse,</b> and M 6 bius (2), by looking at the ESR spectra of the anion radical of tetracyanoquinodimethane, observe...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} {{vertical}} modeling approach {{for the analysis}} of survival data with competing risks to incorporate a cured fraction in the population, that is, a proportion of the population for which none of the competing events can occur. The proposed method has three components: the proportion of cure, the risk of failure, irrespective of the cause, and the relative risk of a certain cause of failure, given a failure occurred. Covariates may affect each of these components. An appealing aspect of the method {{is that it is a}} natural extension to competing risks of the semi-parametric mixture cure model in ordinary survival analysis; thus, causes of failure are assigned only if a failure occurs. This contrasts with the existing mixture cure model for competing risks of Larson and <b>Dinse,</b> which conditions at the onset on the future status presumably attained. Regression parameter estimates are obtained using an EM-algorithm. The performance of the estimators is evaluated in a simulation study. The method is illustrated using a melanoma cancer data set.

50|$|The choir organ, {{placed in}} the south wing of the transept, was built in 1680 by Johann Georg Wulff and {{comprised}} 14 registers.In 1758 Johann Wilhelm Wulff conducted a thorough renovation of the organ, extending the disposition of the organ to 18 registers. Then in 1874, Carl Schuricht performed the organ restoration; however, no further details are recorded. In 1902 Berlin based company of brothers Oswald and Paul <b>Dinse</b> carried out further reconstruction of the organ, introducing a pneumatic tracker action and {{reducing the number of}} registers to 14 (2 manuals and a pedal).When, between the years 1934-1935, Joseph Goebel was restoring the great organ, he also took care of the choir organ. It received a new electric tracker action and was connected to the main console. In 2003, a contemporary Emanuel Kemper 17-pipe organ with a mechanical and electric tracker action was imported from Germany. Afterwards, an organ builder Jerzy Kukla installed it in an antique organ case, thus, replacing the previous instrument. The choir organ is at present connected with the great organ.|$|R

The well-documented loss of tactile acuity in elderly {{is accompanied by}} deterioration of haptic performance and fine manipulative movements. Physical training and exercise can maintain sensorimotor fitness into high age. However, regular schedules of training require discipline and physical fitness. We here present an alternative interventional paradigm to enhance tactile, haptic, and fine motor performance based on passive, sensory stimulation by means of tactile coactivation. This approach is based on patterned, synchronous tactile stimulation applied to the fingertips for 3 hours. The stimulation drives plastic reorganizational changes in somatosensory cortex that affect perception and behavior: We demonstrate that following 3 hours of coactivation tactile acuity as well as haptic object exploration and fine motor performance are improved for at least 96 hours. Because this kind of intervention does not require active participation or attention of the subjects, we anticipate that coactivation is a prime candidate for future therapeutic interventions in patients with impaired sensorimotor abilities. It can be assumed that the maintenance and restoration of sensorimotor functions can ensure and preserve independence of daily living. Further optimizing of the stimulation protocol can be assumed to strengthen both the range and durability of its efficacy.

In contrast, only {{a few studies have}} investigated the effect of age on proprioceptive hand function. Here, we introduce a novel test for measuring joint position sense in the fingers of the human hand. In a concurrent matching task, subjects had to detect volume differences between polystyrene balls grasped with their dominant (seven test stimuli: 126 &ndash; 505 cm 3) and their nondominant hand (three reference stimuli: 210, 294, and 505 cm 3). A total of 21 comparisons were performed to assess the number of errors, the weight of errors (ie, the volume difference between test and reference stimuli), and the direction of errors (ie, over- or underestimation of test stimulus). The test was applied to 45 healthy subjects aged 21 to 79 years. Our results revealed that all variables changed significantly with age, with the number of errors showing the strongest increase. We also assessed tactile acuity (two-point discrimination thresholds) and sensorimotor performance (pegboard performance) in a subset of subjects, but these scores did not correlate with joint position sense performance, indicating that the test reveals specific information about joint position sense that is not captured with pure sensory or motor tests. The average test&ndash;retest reliability assessed on 3 consecutive days was 0. 8 (Cronbach&# 39;s alpha). Our results demonstrate that this novel test reveals age-related decline in joint position sense acuity that is independent from sensorimotor performance.

This term denotes the absence of significant disease and disabilities, maintenance of high levels of physical and cognitive function, and preservation of social and productive activities. Preservation of an active lifestyle is considered an effective means through which everyday competence can be attained. In this context, {{it is crucial to}} obtain ratings of modern day older adults&rsquo; everyday competence by means of appropriate assessments. Here, we introduce the Everyday Competence Questionnaire (ECQ), designed to assess healthy older adults&# 39; everyday competence. Methods: The ECQ includes 17 items, covering housekeeping, leisure activities, sports, daily routines, manual skills, subjective well-being, and general linguistic usage. The ECQ was administered to a population of 158 healthy subjects aged 60 &ndash; 91 years, who were divided into groups {{on the basis of their}} physical activity. These groups were community-dwelling subjects, those living independently and having a sedentary lifestyle, those living independently but characterized by a general lifestyle without any noteworthy physical activity, and those living independently and exercising regularly. Age, gender, and education levels were balanced between the groups. Results: Using the ECQ, we could identify and distinguish different everyday competence levels between the groups tested: Subjects characterized by an active lifestyle outperformed all other groups. Subjects characterized by a general lifestyle showed higher everyday competence than those with a sedentary lifestyle or subjects who needed care. Furthermore, the ECQ data showed a significant positive correlation between individual physical activity and everyday competence. Conclusion: The ECQ is a novel tool for the questionnaire-based evaluation of everyday competence among healthy subjects. By including leisure activities, it considers the changed living conditions of modern-day older adults. Keywords: successful aging, everyday competence, questionnaire-based evaluatio...|$|R
