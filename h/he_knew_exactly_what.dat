5|$|Despite his bluster, Kutuzov {{knew from}} dispatches that his army {{had been too}} badly hurt to fight a {{continuing}} action the following day. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he was doing: by fighting the pitched battle, he could now retreat with the Russian army still intact, lead its recovery, and force the weakened French forces to move even further from their bases of supply. The dénouement became a textbook example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply. On September8, the Russian army {{moved away from the}} battlefield in twin columns to Semolino, allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for 5 weeks a Russian surrender that would never come.|$|E
500|$|When {{they were}} going to record the song, Bailey said that he was excited, nervous, and [...] "almost over-prepared for it", <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> {{instruments}} were going on every track; it took three days to record. Before the release the song was remixed by Sadkin at RAK Studios, in London. About the process Bailey commented: [...] "You know what a great producer is? It's someone who takes great ideas and makes them into good records. In our field, great music is a hit record." [...] The song became the Thompson Twins' biggest hit in America, {{but at the same time}} it pressured the band to produce top-selling music, even if they were not completely comfortable with that, as Alannah Currie stated in an interview with David Oriard of The Spokesman-Review: ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, he was {{involved}} in shows for the BBC and Thames Television (as well as Frankie Howerd Reveals All for Yorkshire Television in 1980). Ray Galton and Alan Simpson wrote for him from 1964 to 1966 when he worked for the BBC and also for a one-off show for Thames, Frankie Howerd meets the Bee Gees, shown on 20 August 1968. He was famous for his seemingly off-the-cuff remarks to the audience, especially in the show Up Pompeii!, which was a direct follow-up from Forum. His television work was characterised by direct addresses to camera and by his littering monologues with verbal tics such as [...] "Oooh, no missus" [...] and [...] "Titter ye not". A later sale of his scripts, however, showed that the seemingly off-the-cuff remarks had all been meticulously planned. Barry Cryer said of his technique: [...] "What he could do with a script was amazing, like all the great performers. He transformed something you'd just written – what you hoped was in a Frankie Howerd idiom – but when you heard him do it, my God, it was something else; – it was gossiping over the garden wall, the apparent waffle – he was like a tightrope walker, you thought he's going to fall off in a minute, you thought , 'Come on, Frank' , we're waiting for a laugh, and then, suddenly, Bang. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he was doing." [...] Another feature of his humour was to feign innocence about his obvious and [...] double entendres, while mockingly censuring the audience for finding them funny.|$|E
5000|$|Verification. The quantum is {{returned}} to the verifier. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the response state should be. This knowledge enables him to perform a [...] "yes/no" [...] verification measurement.|$|R

5000|$|In the NFL, Belk {{proved to}} be a versatile, reliable, and very {{intelligent}} football player, starting at both defensive end and tackle. One of his coaches, Dick Nolan, made this testimony in reference to Belk, “What I like about Bill is that he’s very smart. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> doing out there and can adjust to any situation." ...|$|R
5000|$|It’s {{really cool}} {{to work with}} a {{director}} who’s done so much, because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants. The fact that he does one shot for an entire scene—andthis could be a scene with eight people and one to two takes—it gives you a level of confidence... he’s very empowering. Blake Lively, on acting in Café Society ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not {{particularly}} impatient, or sorry for Major Coulthurst, though one could fancy that his dislike of official correspondence is quite {{as strong as}} his fondness for chess. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has to do, and does it without having to trouble about the results, which in his case concern the Crown. That naturally simplifies one's outlook." ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Ruby buffeted the billows manfully. He {{was fully}} alive {{to the extreme}} danger of the attempt, but <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he meant to do. He trusted to his {{intimate}} knowledge of every ledge and channel and current, and had calculated his motions to a nicety.|$|E
6000|$|The young [...] "fakir" [...] {{believed}} <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> {{kind and}} amount of stock he wished to purchase on the following day, therefore he had no preparations to make for the journey save to get his limbs {{in the best possible}} condition for the tramp by retiring very early, in order to [...] "scoop in" [...] plenty of sleep.|$|E
60|$|Andre-Louis went. Before {{they reached}} that {{sheet of paper}} nailed upon the door, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it would say.

6000|$|... 'Ay, but I don't {{know about}} feeling settled, either, Mr. Manston. The old {{window in the}} chimney-corner of the old house I shall never forget. No window in the chimney-corner where I am now, and I {{had been used to}} it for more than fifty years. Ted says 'tis a great loss to me, and <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I feel.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The track may be {{considered}} an autobiographical account of Edwards' attempts to hold down any meaningful relationships. [...] "Revol" [...] is [...] "lover" [...] spelt backwards. The lyric also places the names of famous political figures next to images of failure in sexual and emotional relationships. Wire, however, has said not even <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the song is about.|$|R
6000|$|... "President Roosevelt is all right," [...] was {{the general}} comment, after the message had been printed in the various papers of our country. [...] "He is looking ahead, and <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> this country wants and needs. We are prosperous now, and {{if we want to}} {{continue}} so, we must keep our hands on the plough, and not look backward." ...|$|R
60|$|From this {{condition}} of repose he {{was awakened by}} a sensation as if of suffocation by smoke. This was such an extremely natural, not to say habitual, state of things with Joe, {{that he was at}} least a couple of seconds in realising the fact that there was unusual cause for haste and vigorous action. Like a giant refreshed Joe leaped to his work. Every fibre of his huge frame was replete with energy, and his heart beat strong, but it beat steadily; not a vestige of a flutter was there, for his head was clear and cool. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> to do. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> was being done. Surprise did, indeed, fill him when he reflected that it was his own house which had caught fire, but that did not for a moment confuse him as to the certainty that the engine must be already out, and his comrades rushing to his assistance.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> {{she would}} have replied {{if she had been}} a Frenchwoman; {{she would have}} said to him, triumphantly, overwhelmingly: 'Que voulez-vous? Elle adore sa mère!' She was, however, only a Californian, unacquainted with the {{language}} of epigram, and her answer consisted simply of the words: 'I am sorry you have ideas that make you unhappy. I guess you are the only person here who hasn't enjoyed himself to-night.' ...|$|E
60|$|He paused, {{and only}} Heron's low chuckle of {{satisfaction}} broke the momentary silence that followed. Blakeney made no reply. Obviously <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> was coming. He knew Chauvelin and his ways, knew {{the kind of}} tortuous conception that would find origin in his brain; the moment that he saw Marguerite sitting there he must have guessed that Chauvelin once more desired to put her precious life {{in the balance of}} his intrigues.|$|E
25|$|Cito {{knows how}} to work with each individual, {{treating}} everyone like a human being. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> to say, when to say it, what to do and how to go about doing it. When you have a manager like that, it makes you want to play for the guy. We'd go to war for him. What Cito has done for the Blue Jays can't be taken lightly.|$|R
5000|$|Leonard Feather's {{opinion of}} Lewis's work is {{representative}} of many other knowledgeable jazz listeners and critics: [...] "Completely self-sufficient and self-confident, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants from his musicians, his writing and his career and he achieves it with an unusual quiet firmness of manner, coupled with modesty and a complete indifference to critical reaction." [...] Lewis was not only this way with his music, but his personality exemplified these same qualities.|$|R
2500|$|The {{editor who}} {{originally}} approved the cartoons, Carsten Juste, later {{declared that the}} opponents of free speech had [...] "won" [...] because the furor would almost undoubtedly deter future editors from printing anything similar. He thought it unlikely that anyone would print a caricature of Muhammad within a generation. He also said that, had <b>he</b> <b>known</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the consequences would be, that is death threats, boycotts, and terror threats, {{he would not have}} printed the cartoons.|$|R
60|$|Thereupon a Japanese {{gentleman in}} the Educational Department began to cross-question {{me on the}} matters of his craft in India, and in {{a quarter of an}} hour got from me the very little that I knew about primary schools, higher education, and the value of an M. A. degree. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he wanted to ask, and only dropped me when the tooth of Desire had clean picked the bone of Ignorance.|$|E
60|$|It was still, very, very still. Over on {{one side}} was a {{beautiful}} rosy glow in the water. It was the reflection from jolly, round, red Mr. Sun. Paddy couldn't see him because of the tall trees, but <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Mr. Sun was doing. He was going to bed behind the Purple Hills. Pretty soon the little stars would come out and twinkle down at him. He loves the little stars and always watches for the first one.|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} his power of {{description}} failed; but that matters little, for, never having {{met with the}} disease before, we can neither describe it nor give it a name. The young doctor did not know it, but <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> to do, and did it. We cannot report what he did, but we can state the result, which was great relief {{in a few minutes}} and a perfect cure before morning! Most men are grateful under such circumstances--even the cruel Rainiharo was so.|$|E
5000|$|The dinner concludes and as Brad {{is about}} to depart on his own trek, he turns around last minute and brings up the {{statement}} that Alex had mentioned earlier about it being a [...] "misunderstanding." [...] Alex states <b>he</b> doesn't <b>know</b> what <b>he</b> means by asking that question and Brad responds with a snarky attitude stating <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> means. Alex explains himself and Brad walks away. Alex reprimands Jenn for asking Brad to dinner, as she apologizes multiple times.|$|R
5000|$|Despite being despised by {{the other}} convicts for his heinous crimes and {{affiliation}} with the Alliance for Purity, T-Bag is quite eloquent and many women find him charming. Knepper comments that, [...] "T-Bag's not crazy. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> doing. He's {{not going to make}} himself stupid." [...] In a separate interview, Knepper says, [...] "I never play him like a stereotypical racist or redneck. He's actually quite cunning and smart." [...] He likens the character to [...] "Truman Capote without a degree." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.8 {{star rating}} out of 5, stating: [...] "'Season of the Hexenbiest' finally brought Nick's line of {{focus to the}} man just below his Grimm world: Renard. Of course, this is still Grimm we're talking about, and Nick {{is still in the}} dark when it comes Renard's royal blood. But Nick won't let up until <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> kind of man Renard is because Renard is the person Nick can place blame on for his {{continually}} caving personal life." ...|$|R
60|$|Very {{slowly and}} very reluctantly Burton {{made his way}} through the gloomy {{warehouse}} and into the salesrooms, which were approached from the street by a separate entrance. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> was before him and he realized that it must be the end. Mr. Waddington, who had not yet mounted the rostrum, saw him come in, stared at him for several moments in his gray clothes and Homburg hat, and turned away to spit upon the floor. A woman with a catalogue in her hand--evidently an intending purchaser--gripped Burton by the arm.|$|E
60|$|The {{energy of}} Doctor Gys was marvelous. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> {{supplies}} {{would be needed}} to fit the Arabella thoroughly for her important mission, and with unlimited funds at his command to foot the bills, he quickly converted the handsome yacht into a model hospital ship. Gys from the first developed a liking for Kelsey, the mate, whom he found a valuable assistant, and the two came to understand each other perfectly. Kelsey was a quiet man, more thoughtful than experienced in medical matters, but his common sense often guided him aright when his technical knowledge was at fault.|$|E
60|$|On the {{day that}} Margaret left Sardis, Roland began his {{preparations}} for descending the shaft. He had so thoroughly considered the machinery and appliances necessary for the undertaking, and had worked out all his plans in such detail, in his mind and upon paper, that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he wanted to do. His orders for the great length of chain exhausted the stock of several manufactories, and the engines he obtained were even more powerful than he had intended them to be; but these he could procure immediately, and for smaller ones {{he would have been}} obliged to wait.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fall in {{love with}} him. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> {{to talk to them}} about, and he has the most persuasive voice you ever heard. I believe Lady Kelsey has been {{in love with}} him for five and twenty years. It's lucky they've not yet passed the {{deceased}} wife's sister's bill, or he would have married her and run through her money as he did his first wife's. He's still very good-looking, and there's such a transparent honesty about him that I promise you he's irresistible.' ...|$|R
500|$|In Cleveland, the {{narrative}} follows {{the point of}} view of a hotel concierge named Ruwan as the city falls under attack by Covenant forces. In the mayhem he meets a woman named Myras Tyla. Tyla [...] remains calm even as Ruwan edges towards all-out panic. The pair are captured and with other residents herded into a sports stadium. The Covenant declare that the humans must give up the location of the Key to save their lives; Tyla is confused, but Ruwan states <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it is.|$|R
2500|$|Draco is the prototypical spoiled, rich brat; he {{believes}} that his family's wealth and social position gives him the right to bully those poorer than himself, such as Ron Weasley. He also insults Hermione Granger's Muggle-born status by referring {{to her as a}} [...] "Mudblood", a term that, as stated by Hagrid, is one not used in civilised conversations. As Rowling explained in 1999, [...] "He's a bigot and he's a bully, and as I say, in the most refined sense, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> will hurt people".|$|R
