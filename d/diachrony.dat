500|$|Synchrony and <b>diachrony,</b> or statics and dynamics, within {{social theory}} are terms that {{refer to a}} {{distinction}} emerging out {{of the work of}} Levi-Strauss who inherited it from the linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure. The former slices moments of time for analysis, thus it is an analysis of static social reality. <b>Diachrony,</b> on the other hand, attempts to analyse dynamic sequences. Following Saussure, synchrony would refer to social phenomena as a static concept like a language, while <b>diachrony</b> would refer to unfolding processes like actual speech. In Anthony Giddens' introduction to Central Problems in Social Theory, he states that, [...] "in order to show the interdependence of action and structure ... we must grasp the time space relations inherent in the constitution of all social interaction." [...] And like structure and agency, time is integral to discussion of social reproduction. In terms of sociology, historical sociology is often better positioned to analyse social life as diachronic, while survey research takes a snapshot of social life and is thus better equipped to understand social life as synchronized. Some argue that the synchrony of social structure is a methodological perspective rather than an ontological claim. Nonetheless, the problem for theory is how to integrate the two manners of recording and thinking about social data.|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{there is}} a strong {{consensus}} regarding the central problems of sociological theory, which are largely inherited from the classical theoretical traditions. This consensus is: how to link, transcend or cope with the following [...] "big three" [...] dichotomies: subjectivity and objectivity, structure and agency, and synchrony and <b>diachrony.</b> The first deals with knowledge, the second with action, and the last with time. Lastly, sociological theory often grapples with the problem of integrating or transcending the divide between micro, meso and macro-scale social phenomena, which is a subset of all three central problems.|$|E

2500|$|Thus {{it seems}} that the {{dislocation}} [...] between the connexions and instances in transition periods merely reflects the coexistence of two (or more) modes of production in a single 'simultaneity ', and the dominance of one of them over the other. This confirms the fact that the problems of <b>diachrony,</b> too, must be thought within the problematic of a theoretical 'synchrony': the problems of the transition and of the forms of the transition from one mode of production to another are problems of a more general synchrony than that of the mode of production itself, englobing several systems and their relations.|$|E
2500|$|The guiding insight of {{construction}} grammar (often abbreviated CxG) is that rules of syntactic combination are directly associated with interpretive and use conditions. All construction-based grammars allow units {{bigger than the}} word as semantic building blocks of syntax. In contrast to traditional compositional approaches to syntax, in which all conceptual content comes from the lexicon, and rules of syntactic combination {{do no more than}} determine which word sequences function as units for syntactic purposes, constructional approaches assume a continuum of idiomaticity (or generality) of expressions, from tightly bound idioms to fully productive patterns. This fundamental commitment unites all of the varieties of CxG, whether or not formal descriptive methods are used and whether the research program targets language development, second-language learning, typology, <b>diachrony,</b> language productions and comprehension, language evolution, conversational practice or social identity. Owing to its focus on descriptive precision, patterns of usage, grammaticalization and the structure of linguistic categories, CxG is closely linked to the explanatory frameworks of cognitive-functional linguistics.|$|E

50|$|The Panchronic {{program in}} {{phonology}} is a development from structural approaches to <b>diachrony.</b> Structural approaches to <b>diachrony</b> study {{the way in}} which phonological systems respond to the causes of change. A major source of change is the constant competition between the tendency towards phonological integration and the tendency towards phonetic simplicity. Phonological economy tends to fill structural gaps in phonological systems, and phonetic economy tends to create phonological gaps. Out of the pool of potential changes, the actual direction of evolution observed in a given language depends in part on the state of its phonological system, e.g. - again taking nasality as an example - which nasal phonemes it possesses (among consonants and vowels), which phonotactic constraints they are subject to, and what functional load they have in the system.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between synchrony and <b>diachrony</b> was {{useful for the}} study of literature as for language, uncovering systems at each separate stage of development. But the history of systems is also a system; each synchronic system has its own past and future as part of its structure. Therefore the distinction should not be preserved beyond its usefulness.|$|E

He was an expert on Proto-Indo-European and Indo-European languages in general, especially morphophonemics, but he also published articles on the history of Eskimo-Aleut languages and linguistic <b>diachrony.</b> He supported the Indo-Uralic and Eurasiatic hypotheses.|$|E

50|$|Synthetically {{conjugated}} verbs like come {{can also}} be conjugated periphrastically (etortzen naiz). In some such cases the synthetic/periphrastic contrast is semantic (e.g. nator and etortzen naiz are not generally interchangeable); in others the contrast is {{more a matter of}} style or register, or else of <b>diachrony</b> (some synthetic forms of conjugation are archaic or obsolete). A few synthetic forms occurring in twentieth-century Basque literature are even a posteriori extrapolations or back-formations of historically unattested forms, created for stylistic, poetic or puristic purposes.|$|E
5000|$|Synchrony and <b>diachrony</b> are two {{different}} and complementary viewpoints in linguistic analysis. A synchronic approach (from Greek συν- [...] "together" [...] and χρόνος [...] "time") considers a language at {{a moment in time}} without taking its history into account. Synchronic linguistics aims at describing a language at a specific point of time, usually the present. By contrast, a diachronic approach (from δια- [...] "through" [...] and χρόνος [...] "time") considers the development and evolution of a language through history. Historical linguistics is typically a diachronic study.|$|E
50|$|Feature {{geometry}} {{has attracted}} formal and conceptual criticism. In 2003 Charles Reiss argued that feature geometry is insufficiently powerful {{to account for}} a class of phonological rules that involve dependencies between segments, such as partial and total identity and nonidentity. Feature geometry is unable to encode these properties. In 2008 Jeff Mielke argued that feature geometry merely recapitulated physiological organization, and that since the influence of articulation on sound change will independently create patterns {{in the behavior of}} features, feature geometry recapitulates <b>diachrony</b> and is redundant as a theory of the mental organisation of phonology.|$|E

50|$|Born in Hungary, Hetzron {{studied at}} the University of Budapest. After the 1956 Uprising in Hungary, he moved to Vienna and then to Paris, where he studied with André Martinet and Joseph Tubiana. In 1960/61 he studied Finnish at Jyväskylä, Somali in London, and Italian at Perugia. He {{received}} his M.A. degree at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1961-1964 {{under the supervision of}} Hans Jakob Polotsky, and his Ph.D. at the University of California, Los Angeles, 1964-1966 under the supervision of Wolf Leslau. From 1966 and until his death he was professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.Hetzron offered original ideas; first of all, about lingusitic subgrouping in <b>diachrony.</b> According to his explicit and theoretically grounded classification of Semitic, Arabic was grouped in Central rather than South Semitic. He demonstrated that in Ethiopian Semitic, the Gurage group is not genetically valid.His attempt to integrate the description of stress and intonation into syntax is unique (see his Hungarian publications).|$|E

5000|$|The {{other main}} {{component}} of différance is deferring, {{that takes into}} account the fact that meaning is a question not only of synchrony with all the other terms inside a structure, but also of <b>diachrony,</b> with everything that was said and will be said, in History, difference as structure and deferring as genesis: 2) [...] "the a of différance also recalls that spacing is temporization, the detour and postponement by means of which intuition, perception, consummation—in a word, the relationship to the present, the reference to a present reality, to a being—are always deferred. Deferred by virtue of the very principle of difference which holds that an element functions and signifies, takes on or conveys meaning, only by referring to another past or future element in an economy of traces. This economic aspect of différance, which brings into play a certain not conscious calculation in a field of forces, is inseparable from the more narrowly semiotic aspect of différance.|$|E
5000|$|Overall, {{there is}} a strong {{consensus}} regarding the central theoretical questions and the central problems that emerge from explicating such questions. Sociological theory attempts to answer the following three questions: (1) What is action? (2) What is social order? and (3) What determines social change? In the myriad attempts to answer these questions, three predominately theoretical (i.e. not empirical) problems emerge. These problems are largely inherited from the classical theoretical traditions. The consensus on the central theoretical problems is: how to link, transcend or cope with the following [...] "big three" [...] dichotomies: subjectivity and objectivity, structure and agency, and synchrony and <b>diachrony.</b> The first deals with knowledge, the second with agency, and the last with time. Lastly, sociological theory often grapples with the problem of integrating or transcending the divide between micro, meso and macro-scale social phenomena, which is a subset of all three central problems. These problems are not altogether empirical problems, rather they are epistemological: they arise from the conceptual imagery and analytical analogies that sociologists use to describe the complexity of social processes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{exhibition}} of works related by subject and theme projected {{a sense of}} overall-ness, a sense of one painting running into another. [...] A reviewer of an exhibition in Maracaibo featuring works from 1976 to 1984, wrote [...] "The synchrony and <b>diachrony</b> of the works cross a still point in which the show {{is no longer a}} total of 27 paintings, but only one." [...] A critic viewed the works linkage at an exhibition in Atlanta as [...] "a net, a polyvalence of economic, cultural, political, and sexual discourse." [...] The net is not just a formal manipulation to tie the divergent contents of the paintings together, but “a very real device that grew out of the complex discourse of the paintings and ultimately from the poetics of the painter.” [...] At a 10-year survey in Caracas a critic wrote [...] "the installation of Kanso monumental paintings projects an immense space charged {{with a high level of}} intensity closely connected to the tension and anxiety that we face in the world today. His apocalyptic paintings offers us a voyage to the hells of our time." ...|$|E

Guillaume {{has never}} denied the {{interesting}} aspects of comparative and historical grammar, {{but he has}} denounced more than once its limitations and its insufficiences. He notes that the saussurian distinction between synchrony and <b>diachrony</b> « remains a bit sketchy ». He considers that historical grammar must extend its observations towards the history of systems, {{that is to say}} towards the <b>diachrony</b> of synchronies. For the distinction between synchrony and <b>diachrony,</b> he finally substitues a distinction between two diachronies : the <b>diachrony</b> of historical contributions and the <b>diachrony</b> of systematic relations. G. Guillaume insists on distinguishing, within the historical explanation, the retrospective point of view, which suffices to explain the morphological facts, from the prospective point of view, which enables to give an account {{of the structure of the}} system.
