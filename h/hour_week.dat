25|$|Michael Joseph Savage, {{leader of}} the Labour Party, became Prime Minister on 6 December 1935, marking the {{beginning}} of Labour's first term in office. The new government quickly set about implementing {{a number of significant}} reforms, including a reorganisation of the social welfare system and the creation of the state housing scheme. Workers also benefited from the introduction of the forty <b>hour</b> <b>week,</b> and legislation making it easier for unions to negotiate on their behalf. Savage himself was highly popular with the working classes, and his portrait could be found on the walls of many houses around the country. At this time the Labour Party pursued an alliance with the Māori Rātana movement.|$|E

60|$|THE strike {{which turned}} Zenith into two belligerent camps; white and red, began late in September with a walk-out of {{telephone}} girls and linemen, in protest against {{a reduction of}} wages. The newly formed union of dairy-products workers went out, partly in sympathy and partly in demand for a forty-four <b>hour</b> <b>week.</b> They were followed by the truck-drivers' union. Industry was tied up, and the whole city was nervous with talk of a trolley strike, a printers' strike, a general strike. Furious citizens, trying to get telephone calls through strike-breaking girls, danced helplessly. Every truck that made its way from the factories to the freight-stations was guarded by a policeman, trying to look stoical beside the scab driver. A line of fifty trucks from the Zenith Steel and Machinery Company was attacked by strikers-rushing out from the sidewalk, pulling drivers from the seats, smashing carburetors and commutators, while telephone girls cheered from the walk, and small boys heaved bricks.|$|E
