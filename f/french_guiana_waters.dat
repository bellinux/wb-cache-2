40|$|A {{regional}} algorithm {{has been}} developed for estimating total suspended matter (TSM) concentration over the MODIS time period in the <b>French</b> <b>Guiana</b> coastal <b>waters.</b> The temporal analysis of the 8 -year time series (2002 - 2010) shows very different patterns of temporal variability translating {{the influence of the}} various hydrodynamic forcings occurring in this coastal system. Hydrodynamical rings formation associated with the retroflecting North Brazil current system induce strong irregular variations in the TSM loads offshore the Guiana coast. Further, strong significant 8 -year interannual changes have been detected along the nearshore <b>waters</b> of <b>French</b> <b>Guiana.</b> The alternance in the distribution of the areas showing increasing and decreasing trends might underline the migration of mud banks particularly dynamic in this coastal region...|$|R
40|$|International audienceParticulate {{suspended}} matter concentration (SPM) were estimated over a 8 year time period (2002 - 2010) {{in the coastal}} <b>waters</b> of <b>French</b> <b>Guiana</b> from a regional algorithm applied to the MODIS monthly reflectance measurements. Comparison between SPOT images and MODIS-SPM maps revealed the strong spatio-temporal coupling between in water SPM and the dynamics of local (i. e. Kourou and Cayenne) mud banks. Highest MODIS SPM values (> 13 g m− 3 approximately) can be significantly associated with the subtidal part of the banks {{as well as to}} the related turbid plume. The migration of these mud banks induces strong interannual changes in SPM reaching up to 6 % year− 1 within increasing and decreasing patchy areas distributed alternatively along the coastline of <b>French</b> <b>Guiana.</b> Mud banks migration rates derived from MODIS SPM data reach in average about 2 km year− 1 in agreement with previous studies. The MODIS time series have allowed for a detailed description of the seasonality and interannual variations in the in-water SPM loads. Seasonal changes in SPM are related to the onset of the trade wind season. Marked non-linear patterns including a sharp evolution in the SPM values around 2005 as well as additional high frequency modulations have been emphasized within the upward and downward SPM trend regions. Concurrent temporal variations in the frequency of northward swells (favoring mud banks migration and reworking) as well as interannual changes in the amount of sediment delivered by the Amazon River have been shown to play a major role in the SPM temporal patterns observed in the <b>French</b> <b>Guiana</b> coastal <b>waters.</b> Our results clearly demonstrate the advantage for ocean color data to describe mud banks dynamics through the assessment of in water SPM temporal variability...|$|R
