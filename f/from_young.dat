5|$|The Longhorns scored {{first with}} a {{touchdown}} pass from Vince Young to Ramonce Taylor; {{this was the first}} time for Texas to lead Oklahoma since 2002 and Texas' first passing touchdown against Oklahoma since 2000. The Sooners' Garrett Hartley answered with a 52-yard field goal, the longest of his college career, and a 9-yard field goal. Longhorn Jamaal Charles scored next on an 80-yard touchdown run. UT then scored with a 38-yard field goal by Richmond McGee and a 64-yard long bomb <b>from</b> <b>Young</b> to Billy Pittman just before halftime, giving Texas a 24–6 lead at the half. UT made the only score of the thirdquarter: a 27-yard touchdown pass <b>from</b> <b>Young</b> to Pittman. In the fourthquarter UT scored twotouchdowns while OU scored one.|$|E

5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, archaeological {{interest}} in the castle grew. From 1951 onwards the Ministry of Works carried out a long-running research project into the Device Forts, the section on Camber being written by the historian Martin Biddle and finally published in 1982. Biddle carried out an exploratory archaeological survey of the site in 1962 and the following year the ruins were closed to allow more extensive archaeological excavation by the Ministry. These were initially carried out by Biddle and Alan Cook, with support from local school children and <b>from</b> <b>young</b> offenders from the Borstal institution in Dover.|$|E

40|$|Tensile {{breaking}} load, strength, strain, {{modulus of elasticity}} {{and density}} plus the histological structure at the fracture site, were determined for 207 standardized specimens of cortical bone from the embalmed femur, tibia, and fibula of 17 men from 36 to 75 years of age. The men were divided into a younger group (41. 5 years old-avg) and an older group (71 years old-avg). Specimens <b>from</b> <b>younger</b> men had a greater average breaking load, strength, strain, modulus and density than those from older men. The percentage of spaces in the break area was greater in specimens from older men, but specimens <b>from</b> <b>younger</b> men had a slightly greater percentage of osteons, osteon fragments, and interstitial lamellae. The number of osteons/mm 2 and of osteon fragments/mm 2 was greater in specimens from older men but the average area/osteon and area/osteon fragment was greater in specimens <b>from</b> <b>younger</b> men. Thus, there are quantitative and qualitative differences in the histological structure of bone <b>from</b> <b>younger</b> and older men. Differences in the tensile properties of bone <b>from</b> <b>younger</b> and older men {{can be explained by}} histological differences in the bone...|$|R

5|$|In years since, {{signatures}} of water {{have been found}} to exist on the lunar surface. In 1994, the bistatic radar experiment located on the Clementine spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface. However, later radar observations by Arecibo, suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected <b>from</b> <b>young</b> impact craters. In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions. Volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water in their interior.|$|E
5|$|Neighbours {{executive}} producer Susan Bower said {{the creation of}} the character and his storyline was a result of requests <b>from</b> <b>young</b> viewers in the Neighbours website forums.

5|$|Development of Knuckles' Chaotix {{began in}} 1994 as an {{internal}} Sega engine test called Sonic Crackers for the Sega Genesis. Contrary to popular belief, this game (and ultimately Knuckles' Chaotix) were not developed by Sonic Team, but rather another internal development team at Sega. This team—which consisted of directors Masahide Kobayashi, Atsuhiko Nakamura, Naohisa Nakazawa, producers Hiroshi Aso, Makoto Oshitani, Mike Larsen, and artist Takumi Miyakewas—was assembled <b>from</b> <b>young</b> {{members of the}} staff who worked on Sonic CD (1993). Sonic Crackers featured Sonic and Tails joined together by a band of rings with an elastic nature. Although never released, the prototype's core tethering gameplay provided the foundation for Knuckles' Chaotix. The prototype ROM image has since leaked on the Internet and can be played {{with the use of}} emulators. Development was eventually transitioned to the 32X. Rather than featuring Sonic, the new game centered around a group of supporting characters led by Knuckles the Echidna, and the project was given the title Knuckles' Ringstar, later renamed Knuckles' Chaotix.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma State scored first, with a {{surprising}} 49yard pass from Al Pena to D'Juan Woods. The Cowboys had lined up tight on 4th and 1 {{as if trying}} a short, power run, but faked that play and threw a deep pass instead, catching the Longhorn defense off-guard. Texas replied with a touchdown pass <b>from</b> <b>Young</b> to Thomas, but David Pino missed the extra point, allowing the Cowboys to retain the lead. Oklahoma State scored another touchdown and Texas completed a field goal to make the score 21–9 {{at the end of}} the firstquarter. The Cowboys scored one touchdown in the secondquarter off of a pass that was deflected by Texas, and Texas made a field goal near the end to cut into the lead, leaving Oklahoma State ahead 28–12 at halftime. The secondhalf was dominated by Texas as they scored fiveunanswered touchdowns to win the game. The scores consisted of tworushing touchdowns by Vince Young, tworushing touchdowns by Ramonce Taylor, and a 21-yard touchdown pass to Neale Tweedie.|$|E
5|$|Texas scored {{first with}} a 42-yard field goal, which was a career-long for Longhorn kicker David Pino. A five-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Vince Young to Billy Pittman gave the Longhorns a 10–0 lead {{at the end of}} the firstquarter. The Buckeyes controlled most of the secondquarter. Their firstscore was a 45yd field goal by Josh Huston followed by a 36-yard touchdown pass from Troy Smith to Santonio Holmes to tie the score at 10–10. They took the lead with twomore field goals from Josh Huston. Texas made a field goal to trim Ohio State's lead to 16–13 at the half. In the thirdquarter, Texas made onefield goal and OSU made two, extending Ohio State's lead to 22–16. In the fourthquarter, Texas regained the lead with a touchdown pass <b>from</b> <b>Young</b> to Limas Sweed. UT's Aaron Harris sacked OSU's Troy Smith for a safety and Texas took a three-point lead, which they held when time expired.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{was stopped}} {{on their first}} drive due to an {{unsuccessful}} fourth down conversion. Baylor's first possession ended when UT's Michael Huff intercepted a pass from Baylor's Terrance Park. Longhorn Jamaal Charles scored a touchdown on the drive but the kick was blocked, giving Texas the only first-quarter score and a 6–0 lead. Texas extended {{the lead in the}} secondquarter with rushing touchdowns from Henry Melton, Jamaal Charles, and Ramonce Taylor. Taylor made two more touchdowns in the thirdquarter and Quan Cosby caught a touchdown pass <b>from</b> <b>Young.</b> In the fourth quarter, Taylor scored his fourthtouchdown and backup quarterback Matt Nordgren scored on an odd play where he was hit and fumbled while scrambling for the goal line but the ball traveled forward at about the same speed he was running and bounced right back up into his hands. Texas won the 2005game 62–0 making it the only shutout of the 2005season for the Longhorns.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} {{units of}} Force 134 entered Norway {{throughout the rest}} of May, gradually reinforcing the airborne troops. On 10 May elements of the 12,000 strong Norwegian police force began to enter the country from Sweden, having been raised <b>from</b> <b>young</b> Norwegians who had fled to Sweden after Norway had been occupied in 1940. General Thorne arrived {{with the rest of his}} headquarters on 13 May, and took up his position as Commander-in-Chief Allied Liberation Forces. In the next two weeks further elements of Force 134 arrived, including a composite American regiment, a Norwegian brigade, and two British infantry brigades composed of re-trained anti-aircraft gunners who replaced the Special Air Service Brigade. Thorne was the de facto Head of Government of Norway until 7 June, when King Haakon returned, and from then until his departure at the end of October was Commander-in-Chief of all military forces in Norway.|$|E
5|$|John Carver, {{right-hand}} man to former Barcelona manager Sir Bobby Robson at Newcastle United, arrived as the club's new assistant manager on 17 December 2009, but the club suffered another 1–0 defeat at home, against Coventry City, two days later. Argyle travelled to Cardiff on Boxing Day to play Cardiff City at their new stadium, and {{came away with}} an important three points thanks to a late goal from Sawyer. They recorded their biggest win of the season two days later against Reading. A brace from Judge, and first goals of the season for Kári Árnason and Ashley Barnes secured a 4–1 win at Home Park and six points from their two games over the Christmas period. Argyle returned to league action after their FA Cup ties on 16 January, looking for another three points against Crystal Palace but an early goal <b>from</b> <b>young</b> striker Victor Moses won the game for the visitors. Another must-win home game followed against Derby County and a fifth goal of the season from Jamie Mackie boosted their survival bid. A defeat by fellow struggler's Sheffield Wednesday, coupled with other results going against them, left Argyle five points from safety, with a tough match to come against West Bromwich Albion a week later. A single goal from striker Simon Cox kept Albion in touch {{at the top of}} the table and left Argyle deep in relegation trouble again, six points from safety.|$|E

40|$|AimThe {{subject of}} {{study was the}} {{influence}} of estrogen (17 β Estradiol) or/and irradiation on cell cycle and cell death of fibroblasts derived <b>from</b> tumours of <b>younger</b> (50 years) cervical cancer patients. A normai fibroblast GSH+/+ cell strain {{was used as a}} reference group. Our objective was to check if stromal fibroblasts were a good model for normaI tissue late effects. Material and methodsFibroblasts were isolated <b>from</b> 9 <b>younger</b> and 9 older women. Four groups of fibroblasts were analysed: control with or without estrogen (E), irradiated with 4 Gy with or without E. 48 -hours after irradiation, cytofluorometric analysis of the cell cycle, Bromodeoxyuridine labelling index (BrdUrdLl), and the percentage of debris (D) and apoptosis (AP) were analysed. ResultsTwo days after irradiation significant decrease in the cell proliferation (BrdUrdLl), percentage of G 1 / 0 cell (in fibroblasts derived <b>from</b> <b>younger</b> patients), decrease in SPF, and arrest of cells in G 2 phase were observed in all experimental groups. A higher cell death [apoptosis (AP) and debris (D) ] after irradiation was observed in fibroblasts from older than <b>from</b> <b>younger</b> patients. However, a ditterence in cell death of fibroblasts coming from patients differing in age and tumour stage was observed. Fibroblasts from smaller (stage I & II) tumours derived <b>from</b> <b>younger</b> women (50 years). However, after treatment with estrogen, the response was reverse. Cells from older women had higher incidence ot AP and D than those <b>from</b> <b>younger</b> patients. Fibroblasts derived from bigger (stage III) tumours and older patients, showed nonsignificantly higher cell death (AP+D) than fibroblasts <b>from</b> <b>younger</b> patients. The results may indicate more severe normai tissue late reactions after radiotherapy in older women, specially after estrogen treatment. ConclusionCell death dependence on tumour stage and patients’ age precludes the usetulness of stromal fibroblasts in prediction of normal tissue response to radiotherapy...|$|R
