25|$|After {{the death}} of Charles XII in 1718, the Swedish {{government}} was financially <b>embarrassed</b> <b>for</b> {{a long time and}} the royal household was often relieved from pecuniary difficulties by the Jewish merchants of Stockholm who insisted, in exchange, for the granting of additional privileges to themselves and their coreligionists. As a consequence the concession of 1718 was renewed and supplemented by royal edicts of 1727, 1746, and 1748, but permission was restricted to settlement in smaller cities and rural communities. One of the most prominent Jews in Sweden at this time was the convert Lovisa Augusti, who {{became one of the most}} popular singers on the stage in Stockholm.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{weapons were}} very well received. Edge praised their weight, stating that each weapon {{encourages}} strategic {{play with their}} secondary functions. Critics generally agreed that the roll and cover system worked well and {{that they did not}} feel overpowered, but some criticised the fact that players need to be in a specific spot to use the cover mode. Reviewers considered the story and voice acting to be weak. IGN said that it is almost impossible not to notice how [...] "laughably bad it is", and that many plot twists are presented then never resolved, but also admitted that it does not really factor into the gameplay. GameCritics reviewer Mike Bracken commented, [...] "It's always sad when there's voice acting in a game and I find myself being <b>embarrassed</b> <b>for</b> the voice actors." [...] Nevertheless, GameSpot added that the game's weapon fire and musical score [...] "easily drown this out." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the runaway}} {{success of the}} single [...] "Please Please Me", the Beatles found {{themselves}} in huge demand {{for the whole of}} 1963. They appeared on ABC TV's Thank Your Lucky Stars show on 11 January (televised 19 January) and recorded for the BBCs Here We Go on 16 January and the BBC's Saturday Club and Talent Spot on 22 January. As well as completing four nationwide tours in 1963, they performed at a great many one-off shows across the UK throughout the year, often finishing one show only to travel straight to the next show in another location—sometimes even to perform again the same day. Two of the nationwide tours were led by popular American stars, but at every show during both tours, the crowds would not stop screaming for the Beatles, who proved even more popular than the American stars. Souvenir programmes were hastily reprinted in response, to show the Beatles as the tour leaders. While pleased with the positive reception, the Beatles were also <b>embarrassed</b> <b>for</b> the American performers, as it had never before happened that a UK act had topped an American act at a UK concert.|$|E

500|$|In the Soviet Union, government-sponsored cookbooks, such as The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food {{curated by}} Anastas Mikoyan, Cookery and Directory of Recipes and Culinary Production, {{promoted}} a unified Soviet cuisine with standardized and nutritionally [...] "rational" [...] versions of traditional dishes. The same cooking techniques and recipes were taught in culinary vocational schools throughout the country, establishing a common cooking style in Soviet cafés and restaurants. Though {{inspired by the}} cuisines of the country's various ethnic groups, many recipes were presented {{as part of an}} overall Soviet heritage, disassociated from their individual geographic origins. By many people {{both inside and outside the}} Soviet Union, borscht was increasingly seen not as an ethnic Ukrainian soup, but as a Soviet or – metonymically – Russian dish. This approach was criticized by William Pokhlebkin, a preeminent Russian food writer, who unequivocally described beet-based borscht [...] as one of the [...] "dishes of Ukrainian cookery" [...] which [...] "have entered the menu of international cuisine". [...] "One could understand", he wrote, [...] "and forgive foreigners for calling borscht or [...] Russian national dishes, but when it turns out that they gleaned the information from Soviet cookbooks or from restaurant menus, one is <b>embarrassed</b> <b>for</b> our authors and chefs, who popularize the national cuisines of our peoples [...] with such ignorance." ...|$|E
500|$|Breeds {{received}} a Logie Award nomination for [...] "Most Popular New Female Talent" [...] at the 51st Logie Awards for her portrayal of Ruby. She was later {{nominated for the}} [...] "Most Popular Actress" [...] Logie in 2010, with Breeds stating: [...] "To know that people like Ruby makes me think I'm doing a good job." [...] At the 2012 Inside Soap Awards, Breeds was nominated for [...] "Best Daytime Star". Holy Soap recall Ruby's most memorable moment as being: [...] "Trying to cope with her Dad's illness, Ruby started talking to someone on Skype, {{only to find out}} it was Matthew playing a trick. She got revenge by convincing him to go skinny-dipping and nicking his clothes." [...] Carolyn Stewart writing for TV Week felt it was unrealistic for Ruby and Nicole to be best friends after she has [...] "actively pursued two of Nicole's ex-boyfriends." [...] She criticised Bianca's role in Ruby and Liam's storyline, quipping [...] "Bianca-The-Butt-In-Ski" [...] offered [...] "her two cents worth" [...] – subsequently calling her efforts unhelpful to Ruby. She also discussed Ruby's sudden descent into drink and wearing make up; [...] "Obviously heavy make-up is a clue that a character is about to go off the rails… and, boy did she!" [...] She said the moral of the storyline was to never {{fall in love with a}} teacher and that the situation had resulted in her as the [...] "drowned-rat Ruby with eye-liner pouring down her face". Stewart later said [...] "The way Ruby stares at Liam... oh, I'm just so <b>embarrassed</b> <b>for</b> the poor little petal! Hilarious!" [...] She also criticised Nicole's bad advice. She later praised the storyline stating it was getting [...] "juicy". Catrin Griffiths writing for the Daily Express said the serial came back in style after its summer break in the UK, owing to storylines such as Ruby's binge drinking.|$|E

Bush in the 2004 presidential election and performed at a Dallas, Texas, rally {{on the night}} before the election. Keith also endorsed Democrat Dan Boren in his successful run in Oklahoma's 2nd congressional district and is good friends with former Democratic New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the reign}} of Tsar Fyodor I his {{brother-in-law}} Boris Godunov contacted the Ecumenical Patriarch, who [...] "was much <b>embarrassed</b> <b>for</b> want of funds," [...] {{with a view to}} establishing a patriarchal see in Moscow. As a result of Godunov's efforts, Metropolitan Job of Moscow became in 1589 the first Patriarch of Moscow and All Rus', making the Russian Church autocephalous. The four other patriarchs have recognized the Moscow Patriarchate as one of the five honourable Patriarchates. During the next half a century, when the tsardom was weak, the patriarchs (notably Hermogenes and Philaret) would help run the state along with (and sometimes instead of) the tsars.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{activities}} like dumpster diving or gleaning are traditionally seen as subsistence {{strategies for the}} poor, most research on freegans finds that individuals come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds and {{have high levels of}} education (even if their present lifestyles make them low-income). Freeganism has also been described as racially exclusive, because freegan's voluntary association of waste would seem to confirm a [...] "globally ubiquitous racial construction" [...] that people of color are dirty and polluted. As one freegan of color wrote, [...] "I am extremely <b>embarrassed</b> <b>for</b> people to see me diving, because I can tell that I’m not just me, I’m also a representation of black people in general...I got harassed by security several times while diving on my own campus, until my white friends pop their heads out of the dumpsters." [...] In contrast, the portrait of the gender balance of freeganism is more mixed, with some accounts saying groups are majority men and others majority women.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, Barlow {{was unable to}} {{reconcile}} his ardent libertarianism with the prevailing neoconservative movement, and [...] "didn't feel tempted to vote for Bush"; in 2004, {{he said that he}} was [...] "voting for John Kerry, though with little enthusiasm". Barlow has subsequently declared that he is a Republican, most notably during an appearance on The Colbert Report on March 26, 2007, and has also claimed on many occasions to be an anarchist. Barlow has said he voted for Natural Law Party Presidential candidate John Hagelin in 2000 after discovering in the voting booth that his friend Nat Goldhaber was Hagelin's running mate. He said in 2004: [...] "I'm <b>embarrassed</b> <b>for</b> my country that in my entire voting life, there has never been a major-party candidate whom I felt I could vote for. All of my presidential votes, whether for George Wallace, Dick Gregory, or John Hagelin, have been protest votes." [...] Barlow condemned Donald Trump in November 2016, characterizing him as a [...] "thorough creep" [...] and [...] "toxic asshole" [...] in a Facebook [...] "micromanifesto".|$|E

2500|$|It is true {{that the}} Territory went into severe {{economic}} decline shortly after abolition of slavery. [...] However, the causes of the decline were numerous. The Territory was rocked by a series of hurricanes; at the time, there was no accurate method of forecasting hurricanes, and their effect was devastating. A particularly devastating hurricane struck in 1837, which was reported to have completely destroyed 17 of the Territory's sugar works, the most lucrative export in the islands. [...] Further hurricanes hit in 1842 and 1852. Two more struck in 1867. The island also suffered severe drought between 1837 and 1847, which made sugar plantation almost impossible to sustain. [...] To compound these miseries, in 1846 the United Kingdom passed the Sugar Duties Act 1846 to equalise duties on sugar grown in the colonies; removing market distortions had the net effect of making prices fall, a further blow to plantation in the British Virgin Islands.By 1848, Edward Hay Drummond Hay, the President of the British Virgin Islands, reported that: [...] "there are now no properties in the Virgin Islands whose holders are not <b>embarrassed</b> <b>for</b> want of capital or credit sufficient to enable them to carry on the simplest method of cultivation effectively." [...] In December 1853 there was a disastrous outbreak of cholera in the Territory, which killed nearly 15% of the population.A total of 942 deaths were recorded out of a total population of 6,919 (13.9%) [...] This was followed by an outbreak of smallpox in Tortola and Jost Van Dyke in 1861.|$|E
