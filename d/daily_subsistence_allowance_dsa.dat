The Secretariat further refers to operative paragraph 38 of resolution ICC-ASP/ 4 /Res. 4 whereby the Assembly of States Parties decided to make a provisional change to the terms of the Trust Fund to allow other developing States to draw on the Fund so as to enhance the possibility of such States to participate in the activities of the Assembly. In this connection, the Secretariat recalls that operative paragraph 61 of resolution ICC-ASP/ 9 /Res. 3 also called “upon States, international organizations, individuals, corporations and other entities to contribute in a timely manner and voluntarily to the Trust Fund”. Contributions to the trust fund may be made directly to the bank account indicated in the annex.

40|$|The western {{extension}} {{area of the}} Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP) covers five countries: Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali (western part), Senegal and Sierra Leone. From 1986 to 1990, national teams employed by the respective governments have been regularly collecting entomological data on the vectors of onchocerciasis in these countries. As in the initial programme area of the OCP, the entomological surveillance network was composed of entomological sectors and subsectors (the latter are called "operational bases" in the western extension). In 1990, 308 staff in 47 capture teams were employed for the entomological surveillance activities in seven sectors and twenty-five operational bases. They included a national coordinator {{as head of the}} teams for each country, a wide range of technicians, and administrative support staff to assist the national coordinator in the overall management of available resources. The national teams worked under the technical responsibility and supervision of WHO/OCP but with no employee/employer relationship between them and WHO, since they were employed and their salaries were paid by their governments. The OCP, however, paid additional lump sum allowances to each worker, as well as <b>daily</b> <b>subsistence</b> <b>allowances</b> when away from their duty station. Vehicles, entomological equipment, office supplies and furniture, fuel and lubricants were provided by WHO/OCP. Despite the difficulties encountered in the field, which were often great, and their lower salaries (compared with colleagues paid by WHO/OCP), the technical workers in the national teams performed well by OCP standards, with results as satisfactory as those obtained by the WHO/OCP teams {{in the rest of the}} programme area. The main reasons for the efficiency and dynamism of the national entomological teams are described. The future of these teams after OCP has ceased its activities is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedRecent reports cite that military Food Stamp Program beneficiaries may range from 6, 400 to 20, 000. The need {{for food stamps}} {{has been attributed to}} several factors, one of which is the perceived military "pay gap". Although, significant strides have been made in recent years to improve quality of life for our service men and women and their families, the military pay system tends to lag behind the civilian employment cost growth index. Despite the strong economy that we currently enjoy, many of our service personnel are struggling to make ends meet. The analysis compared the costs associated with providing eligible personnel with food stamps to the cost of providing a Special <b>Subsistence</b> <b>Allowance</b> in lieu of food stamps. On the surface, the Federal Government may realize approximately $ 7, 862, 400 savings if the additional subsistence is set at $ 180 per beneficiary per month, as posed in Senate legislation. Despite such savings, the Department of Defense is constrained by its compensation system, which uses promotion and pay increases to encourage advancement and longevity as a basis for compensation. The Special <b>Subsistence</b> <b>Allowance</b> in lieu of food stamps could also have devastating financial effects for some while providing a cash bonus for others. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

5000|$|On 4 January 2013 the {{association}} Democracia Real Ya (DRY), created after the 15 May 2011 protest movement, brought charges against Mariano Rajoy and another 62 deputies (including four ministers) before the Supreme Court, {{accusing them of}} diversion of public funds and misappropriation. Mariano Rajoy was accused of receiving a <b>subsistence</b> <b>allowance</b> {{despite the fact that}} he was living in the Moncloa Palace in Madrid. The lawsuit before the Supreme Court was a consequence of the data which had appeared in the media providing information about several deputies who had houses in Madrid but at the same time were receiving extra funds for lodging. According to {{the association}} DRY, these representatives, who could be lodged at no cost to the public purse, were paid a monthly <b>subsistence</b> <b>allowance</b> valued at 1,823.36 euros. Furthermore, if they had been elected by the constituency of Madrid and had a house in this city, they were allowed 870 euros per month to cover accommodation and food expenses resulting from the exercise of their functions that, with respect to Rajoy, were already covered - from the state budget - in the Moncloa Palace. DRY therefore accused them of diversion of public funds and misappropriation. Additionally, DRY demanded that they return all the money that didn't belong to them, particularly bearing in mind that [...] "the cuts are making most Spaniards' life a misery".|$|R
