This paper measures the impact of child health <b>insurance</b> <b>on</b> health care utilization and spending of children from 6 to 14 years old in Vietnam using two recent nationally representative surveys. Unlike previous empirical studies which found a positive effect of health <b>insurance</b> <b>on</b> health care utilization in Vietnam, we did not find a statistically significant effect of school health insurance as well as free health <b>insurance</b> for children <b>on</b> outpatient health care contacts. However, the school health insurance and free health insurance help the insured children decrease out-of-pocket spending per outpatient contact by around 14 and 26 percent, respectively. ...|$|R

40|$|Few studies {{analyze the}} effects of health <b>insurance</b> <b>on</b> {{inpatient}} care in low income countries. This paper provides an empirical assessment {{of the influence of}} Vietnam's health <b>insurance</b> schemes <b>on</b> both hospital admission and the length of stay (LOS) using the Vietnam National Health Survey 2001 - 2002 and an appropriate count data regression model. Our findings suggest that the influence of health <b>insurance</b> <b>on</b> hospital admission and the LOS varies across insurance schemes. The compulsory insurance scheme and the insurance scheme for the poor increase the expected LOS by factors of 1. 18 and 1. 39, respectively, while the voluntary insurance scheme has minimal effect on the expected LOS. Insurance also increases the likelihood of hospital admission far more for compulsory members than for members of the other two insurance schemes. The positive influence of <b>insurance</b> <b>on</b> hospital admission and the LOS also varies across income quintiles, regions and types of health facilities. While the compulsory and voluntary schemes increase the likelihood of hospital admission more for lower and middle income individuals, the influence of the compulsory scheme on the expected LOS is more pronounced for patients in the middle income groups. The influence of <b>insurance</b> <b>on</b> the LOS is also found to be stronger in the North than in the South and stronger for patients admitted to provincial hospitals rather than district hospitals.
