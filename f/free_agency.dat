40|$|In some texts Nietzsche vehemently {{denies the}} {{possibility}} of free will; in others he seems positively to countenance its existence. This chapter distinguishes two different notions of <b>free</b> will. <b>Agency</b> <b>free</b> will is intrinsically tied {{to the question of}} agency; what constitutes an action as opposed to a mere doing. Deserts free will is intrinsically tied to the question of desert; of who does and does not merit punishment and reward. It is shown that we can render Nietzsche's prima facie conflicting assertions regarding free will compatible by interpreting him as rejecting deserts free will while accepting {{the possibility of}} <b>agency</b> <b>free</b> will. Nietzsche advances an original form of compatibilism that takes <b>agency</b> <b>free</b> will to be a rare achievement rather than a natural endowment...|$|R

40|$|Derk Pereboom’s <b>Free</b> Will, <b>Agency,</b> and Meaning in Life {{provides}} the most lively and comprehensive defense of free will skepticism in the literature. It contains a reworked and expanded version of the view he first developed in Living without Free Will. Important objections to the early book are answered, some slight modifications are introduced, and the overall account is significantly embellished—for example, Pereboom proposes a new account of rational deliberation consistent {{with the belief that}} one’s actions are causally determined and develops a forward-looking theory of moral responsibility con- sistent with free will skepticism.

5000|$|In 1991, Wolf {{was hired}} to replace Packers General Manager Tom Braatz. Wolf's first major {{decisions}} were to fire head coach Lindy Infante, hire then-San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Mike Holmgren to replace him, and to trade for then-Atlanta Falcons backup quarterback Brett Favre. In 1993, Wolf signed the most sought after free-agent available, Reggie White, bringing in a team leader and defensive superstar. This signing, in NFL <b>free</b> <b>agency's</b> first year, also made Green Bay a more desirable destination for future potential free agents, including White's fellow defensive linemen Santana Dotson and Sean Jones. Specifically, White's arrival negated the perception of Green Bay as a city where African-American players did not feel welcome. [...] With White and cast-off Gilbert Brown, Dotson and Jones formed {{the heart of the}} Packer defense during the team's championship run.|$|R

40|$|Free {{cash flow}} has been {{identified}} as having {{the potential to be a}} major agency cost where managers make expenditures that have negative NPVs. This agency problem reduces profitability and lowers stock market valuations. We argue that firms with high free cash flow and poor growth opportunities will suffer from the <b>free</b> cash flow <b>agency</b> problem. Our results are consistent with expectations and show that firms with high free cash flow and low growth are associated with low long term profitability. We also find that managers use income-decreasing accruals when a firm has high <b>free</b> cash flow <b>agency</b> costs. This earnings management is motivated by managers' desire to shift profits to future years when the full impact of the sub-optimum investments hits earnings. The evidence supports Fudenberg and Tirole's (1995) managerial self interest hypothesis. Consistent with the institutional investor monitoring hypothesis, we show that institutional shareholders act to deter managers from using negative discretionary accruals when <b>free</b> cash flow <b>agency</b> costs are potentially high.
