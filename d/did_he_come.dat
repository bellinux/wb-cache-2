25|$|The Imperial troops inflicted {{losses of}} 1,000 killed and wounded on their enemies. In addition, they scooped up 1,500 Spanish prisoners and {{captured}} five artillery pieces and two colors. Saint-Cyr reported losses of 600, mostly in Pino's Italian units. Reding was nearly captured {{while trying to}} rally his men. Vives abandoned his horse while escaping up a cliff. He reached the coast and was taken off to Tarragona in HMS Cambrian. Milans {{arrived on the scene}} after the battle was finished. Lazán never got as far as Sant Celoni, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>come</b> into contact with Chabot's small division. After hearing the bad news, Lazán marched his command back to Girona.|$|E
25|$|Bisgood {{went on to}} make 66 further {{appearances}} for Somerset up to 1921, {{but only}} once <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>come</b> close to matching his success in that first game. He played in nine further matches in 1907 without passing 50 once; after 11 matches in 1908 and eight in 1909, his next score of more than 50 came in 1910; there were two scores of 50 or more in both 1911 and 1912 seasons. In 1914, however, in the match against Gloucestershire at Taunton, Bisgood had a second triumph. In the first innings, he made 116 in three hours, the second century of his career equalling his first; then in the second innings he led Somerset to a rare victory by making an unbeaten 78 {{out of a total}} of 134 for three wickets, made in 70 minutes.|$|E
500|$|He {{joined the}} AAA Columbus Clippers for their playoffs. Kipnis batted [...]455 in five games, and hit for the cycle on September 17 in the Clippers’ victory that {{clinched}} the International League title. His big game was voted {{second in the}} 2010 Fans Choice [...] "Best Game" [...] Minor League Baseball Yearly Awards. Veteran catcher Luke Carlin said: They bring up Kipnis from Akron, {{and we look at}} this little guy and say, 'Where <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>come</b> from, and what is he doing here?' We were teasing him, and all he does is go out and hit about a million. I mean, here's this little infielder and they put him in the fifth spot ... What's that about? He goes out and hits for the cycle.|$|E

2500|$|Because of his last-second {{passes to}} win {{many of his}} races {{and his ability to}} start deep in the field and finish towards the front, he was nicknamed [...] "Mr. Where <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>come</b> from?" [...] by NASCAR on Fox {{announcer}} Mike Joy. In the 2011 season, commentators began referring to Harvick as [...] "The Closer" [...] for his late-passing wins.|$|E
2500|$|On November 4, 2007, James Black, NFL Editor for Yahoo! Sports wrote, [...] "Every week, in {{addition}} to out-leaping at least one defender for a touchdown, [...] keeps making incredible one-handed grabs that make you mutter, 'How the heck <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>come</b> up with that?'" [...] Two weeks later, he added a career-high 4 touchdown receptions in a single game against Buffalo.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{columnist}} William Safire, {{the first}} published use of bork as a verb was possibly in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution of August 20, 1987. Safire defines to bork by reference [...] "to the way Democrats savaged Ronald Reagan's nominee, the Appeals Court judge Robert H. Bork, the year before." [...] Perhaps {{the best known}} use of the verb to bork occurred in July 1991 at a conference of the National Organization for Women in New York City. Feminist Florynce Kennedy addressed the conference {{on the importance of}} defeating the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying, [...] "We're going to bork him. We're going to kill him politically... This little creep, where <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>come</b> from?" [...] Thomas was subsequently confirmed after one of the most divisive confirmation hearings in Supreme Court history.|$|E

2500|$|Waltrip's {{first season}} with Junior Johnson was a huge success. He won 12 races {{including}} big races such as the Southern 500, the Food City 500, and the Riverside 400 event. He almost set a win record at Talladega for his 1981 season (winning the big races) by nearly winning the Talladega 500. On the final lap rookie Ron Bouchard dove under Waltrip and Terry Labonte to take the lead. Bouchard beat Waltrip by a foot in a 3-wide drag race {{in what has been}} called the biggest upset in NASCAR history. Waltrip reportedly said [...] "Where the hell <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>come</b> from?" [...] in an interview. Waltrip also stated in a post-race conference that part of the reason he lost the race was because he thought Bouchard was a lap down and therefore did not block Bouchard.|$|E
2500|$|Johan Derksen {{claimed in}} VI that Cambuur had paid {{a large sum}} of money to keep Oeki Hoekema from being suspended. According to Derksen Vlaardingen player and chief witness of the case Herman den Haag had {{received}} a few banknotes for the trouble {{out of the hands}} of a Cambuur official whilst on the toilet. De Volkskrant wanted to get to the bottom of it and called KNVB official Van Zon, who stated he had laughed very hard when he heard the claims. [...] "Money handed out on the toilet? How <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>come</b> up with that? I have seen it with my own eyes: the Cambuur representative gave the cash to the witnesses. No, not on the toilet but in public in the bar of our restaurant. It wasn't much money either, If I recall correctly it was fl. 50. Those few ten-guilder notes aren't even enough to cover the witnesses' expenses, since all the witnesses had to travel from Rotterdam to here. The KNVB pays fl. 0.35 per kilometre." [...] "Quite a crappy story indeed, Derksen wrote, but then again, that's what we're accustomed to. You wanna know who were present in court at the time? Me, another journalist and a man with a tape recorder. Derksen wasn't there. Probably on the toilet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>come?</b> {{you know}} {{that as far as}} I have yet heard he is still your mother's enemy and yours, and is persecuting you to rob you of your name and of your property. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>come</b> as a friend?" ...|$|E

6000|$|She disliked Mr. Goodwood's questions, but {{she said}} to herself that she owed it to him to satisfy him as far as possible.

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>did</b> not <b>come</b> {{back that}} day, and, in fact, he delicately waited for some sign from us that his help was wanted.

6000|$|... “Tell me, John,” said Elizabeth, {{willing to}} draw his {{thoughts}} to other subjects, {{and at the}} same time yielding to her own powerful interest in the youth; “who is this Mr. Edwards? why are you so fond of him, and whence <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>come</b> ?” ...|$|R
