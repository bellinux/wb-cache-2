5|$|Because of {{its large}} size and beauty, the <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> is an {{attraction}} at zoos around the world. The <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> {{is one of}} several bird species with an AZA studbook, which is kept by Shelly Collinsworth of the Fort Worth Zoo.|$|E
5|$|Although it locates food by vision, {{the role}} smell has {{in how it}} {{specifically}} finds carrion has been debated. Consensus has been {{that it does not}} detect odours, and instead follows the smaller turkey and greater yellow-headed vultures, which do have a sense of smell, to a carcass, but a 1991 study demonstrated that the <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> could find carrion in the forest without the aid of other vultures, suggesting that it locates food using an olfactory sense. The <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> primarily eats carrion found in the forest, though it is known to venture onto nearby savannas in search of food. Once it has found a carcass, the <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> displaces the other vultures because of its large size and strong bill. However, when it is at the same kill as the larger Andean condor, the <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> always defers to it. Using its bill to tear, it makes the initial cut in a fresh carcass. This allows the smaller, weaker-beaked vultures, which can not open the hide of a carcass, access to the carcass after the <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> has fed. The vulture’s tongue is rasp-like, which allows it to pull flesh off of the carcass’s bones. Generally, it only eats the skin and harder parts of the tissue of its meal. The <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> has also been recorded eating fallen fruit of the moriche palm when carrion is scarce in Bolívar state, Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|Large and {{predominantly}} white, the <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> has gray {{to black}} ruff, flight, and tail feathers. The {{head and neck}} are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> has a very noticeable orange fleshy caruncle on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World vulture species from a carcass. King vultures {{have been known to}} live for up to 30 years in captivity.|$|E
50|$|Tropical America: {{contains}} <b>king</b> <b>vultures,</b> cotton-top tamarins, Chilean flamingos, birds, giant anteaters, bats, and more. The anteater exhibit {{opened in}} 2007.|$|R
50|$|La Selva {{houses the}} zoo's jaguars, {{cotton-top}} tamarins, and golden-headed lion tamarins. This loop also feature's green iguanas, a Baird's tapir, {{a family of}} capybara, and a Hoffmann's two-toed sloth. In March 2007, a newly constructed vulture exhibit opened, which houses <b>king</b> <b>vultures,</b> turkey vultures, and black vultures. Vulture feedings and demonstrations are offered to visitors {{much the same way}} they are conducted within the Wild Florida loop.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{animals in the}} major exhibits, the zoo includes many individual exhibits that are home to animals including bald eagles, North American river otters, black-tailed prairie dogs, Aldabra giant tortoise, ring-tailed lemurs, Magellanic penguins, common squirrel monkeys, <b>king</b> <b>vultures,</b> white-handed gibbons, Japanese macaques.|$|R
5|$|The <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> has, {{relative}} to its size, the largest skull and braincase, and strongest bill of the New World vultures. This bill has a hooked tip {{and a sharp}} cutting edge. The bird has broad wings and a short, broad, and square tail. The irises of its eyes are white and bordered by bright red sclera. Unlike some New World vultures, the <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> lacks eyelashes. It also has gray legs and long, thick claws.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{noticed that}} Bartram's notes were {{considerably}} altered and expanded in the printed edition, and the {{detail of the}} white tail appeared in print {{for the first time}} in this revised account. Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird from memory and got the tail coloration wrong. Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> relative in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of extinction and finally disappeared during a cold spell. Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could be a sign that the painted vulture was a subspecies of the <b>king</b> <b>vulture.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> eats {{anything}} from cattle carcasses to beached fish and dead lizards. Principally a carrion eater, there are isolated reports of it killing and eating injured animals, newborn calves and small lizards.|$|E
25|$|Birds of Prey is {{a row of}} cages for {{multiple}} raptor species. The exhibit is home to bald eagles, snowy owls, European eagle-owls, a barred owl, an Andean condor, cinereous <b>vultures,</b> and <b>king</b> <b>vultures.</b> In February 2011, the zoo received two bald eagles rescued in Wyoming. Nearby is a small pond for black-necked swans, American white pelicans, and brown pelicans.|$|R
5000|$|Koepcke {{reported}} hearing <b>king</b> <b>vultures</b> around her, recognizing {{them from}} her previous encounters with them while living at her parents' research station only a-year-and-a-half previously. She figured {{that there must}} be dead bodies in the area, though it wasn't until the next day that she discovered some. She came across three passengers still strapped to their seats who had landed head-first into the ground. She said of the encounter: ...|$|R
50|$|The forest {{has been}} mostly {{unbroken}} since the Maya left it centuries ago. The park has high biodiversity. Species {{found in the}} park include keel-billed motmots, kinkajous, jaguars, jaguarundis, <b>king</b> <b>vultures,</b> margays, ocelots, ocellated turkeys, Yucatan spider monkeys, and Baird's tapirs. It has Belize's largest breeding population of scarlet macaws. New insect and crustacean species have been discovered in the park. The biological diversity of the park {{has not yet been}} fully explored. In 1993, a botanist from Missouri Botanical Garden collected more than 130 plant species previously unreported in Belize. Three of these species had never before been reported in Central America.|$|R
5|$|The bird's {{blood and}} {{feathers}} {{were also used}} to cure diseases. The <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> is also a popular subject on the stamps of the countries within its range. It appeared on a stamp for El Salvador in 1963, Belize in 1978, Guatemala in 1979, Honduras in 1997, Bolivia in 1998, and Nicaragua in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{systematic}} {{placement of}} the <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors {{in different parts of}} the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in Incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible. Like other New World vultures, the <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> has a diploid chromosome number of 80.|$|E
5|$|The <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> (Sarcoramphus papa) {{is a large}} bird {{found in}} Central and South America. It {{is a member of}} the New World vulture family Cathartidae. This vulture lives {{predominantly}} in tropical lowland forests stretching from southern Mexico to northern Argentina. It is the only surviving member of the genus Sarcoramphus, although fossil members are known.|$|E
5|$|Little {{can be said}} of the {{evolutionary}} history of the genus, mainly because remains of other Neogene New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the Great American Interchange, and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in Central America. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the S. fisheri – S. papa lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports the theory that the ancestral <b>king</b> <b>vultures</b> and South American condors separated at least some 5 mya.|$|R
50|$|The <b>vulture</b> <b>king</b> (Sarcoramphus papa) {{holds an}} {{important}} {{place in the}} Bribri cosmovision. He {{is the only one}} that can fly high enough to reach the top of the Universe and thus serves as a link between Sibu and the other worlds. It is believed that while regular vultures, who are his helpers, roost in trees like other birds, the <b>vulture</b> <b>king</b> rises up to sleep with Sibu after eating.|$|R
5|$|While most early ornithologists defended Bartram's honesty, Joel Asaph Allen {{argued that}} the painted vulture was mythical and that Bartram mixed {{elements}} of different species to create this bird. Allen {{pointed out that the}} birds' behavior, as recorded by Bartram, is in complete agreement with the caracara's. For example, Bartram observed the birds following wildfires to scavenge for burned insects and box turtles. Such behavior is typical of caracaras, but the larger and shorter-legged <b>king</b> <b>vultures</b> are not well adapted for walking. The northern crested caracara (Caracara cheriway) was believed to be common and conspicuous in Bartram's days, but it is notably absent from Bartram's notes if the painted vulture is accepted as a Sarcoramphus. However, Francis Harper {{argued that the}} bird could, as in the 1930s, have been rare in the area Bartram visited and could have been missed.|$|R
5|$|Due to its remoteness, Sangay hosts a {{significant}} biological community with fauna {{such as the}} mountain tapir, giant otter, Andean cock-of-the-rock and <b>king</b> <b>vulture.</b> Since 1983, its ecological community has been protected {{as part of the}} Sangay National Park. Although climbing the mountain is hampered by its remoteness, poor weather conditions, river flooding, and the danger of falling ejecta, the volcano is regularly climbed, a feat first achieved by Robert T. Moore in 1929.|$|E
5|$|King {{vultures}}, which {{lack the}} ability to smell carrion, follow the greater yellow-headed vultures to carcasses, where the <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> tears open {{the skin of the}} dead animal. This allows the smaller greater yellow-headed vulture access to food, as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to their larger size.|$|E
5|$|The <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> soars {{for hours}} effortlessly, only {{flapping}} its wings infrequently. While in flight, its wings are held flat with slightly raised tips, {{and from a}} distance the vulture can appear to be headless while in flight. Its wing beats are deep and strong. Birds have been observed engaging in tandem flight on two occasions in Venezuela by naturalist Marsha Schlee, who has proposed {{it could be a}} part of courtship behaviour.|$|E
50|$|In 1932, the Works Progress Administration funded a major {{expansion}} {{project in}} the Valley. The project was never fully completed, but it {{was used as a}} small grotto for smaller mammal exhibits. Through the years, the small grotto was home to various animals including Arctic foxes, hyenas, colobus monkeys, binturong, coatimundi, river otters, aardwolf, red pandas, maned wolves, white-tailed sea eagles, and <b>king</b> <b>vultures.</b> Most of the structural work completed by the WPA remains intact, and the zoo planned to preserve the historical elements of the original 1912 bear pit, the 1932 WPA small grotto, and Monkey Island by incorporating them into {{the construction of a new}} polar bear exhibit. Other issues with the location forced the new polar bear exhibit to be relocated to the Front Entry Plaza. The old structures in the Valley remain unused until a new development plan is announced that will incorporate their historically significant features.|$|R
50|$|The {{park has}} a zoo with {{beautiful}} animals including jaguars, monkeys, squirrels, Chiguires, Ocelots, laziness, Opossum, {{many kinds of}} birds: Caricare, many types of parrot, yellow-shouldered parrot, Tinamou, White Heron, kind egret, Blue heron, gonzalito, blue and yellow macaw, scarlet macaw, scarlet macaw, Green macaw, North Guacharaca, Barn Owls,helmeted curassow, <b>king</b> Zamuro (<b>vulture),</b> Red-billed toucan and reptiles including crocodiles and anacondas.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{master plan}} was {{formulated}} {{in the late}} 2000s, dubbed [...] "The New Zoo". Almost every area of the zoo will be affected and the changes will be momentous - all aimed at enhancing the visitor’s experience {{and understanding of the}} natural world. Capital improvements include renovations on the Plains of Africa exhibit, renaming it Fabric of Africa. The renovated area includes an outdoor elephant enclosure twice as big as the previous one with an immersion pool for bathing. A new veterinary hospital opened in the spring of 2011, helping to ensure continued top-notch healthcare for the zoo’s animal collection. In 2012, Hasbro's Our Big Backyard, an interactive playspace, was opened. Featuring hands-on educational fun and an interactive tree house, it opened June 4, with a second phase featuring native New England animals completed in 2014. Originally the North American trail was supposed to host the return of the polar bears, but due to the economic downturn the zoo has decided that a new polar bear exhibit was not feasible. In the summer of 2012 the zoo opened new exhibits for takins, red river hogs, and <b>king</b> <b>vultures.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fauna is {{similarly}} distributed, with distinct altitudinal zonation present. The highest altitudes support the endangered mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), cougar (Puma concolor), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus). Lower down, the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), brocket deers (Mazama sp.), vulnerable northern pudú (Pudu mephistophiles), and endangered giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) {{can all be}} found. Bird species common in the area include the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), torrent duck (Merganetta armata), <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> (Sarcoramphus papa), and swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus).|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{appears in a}} variety of Maya hieroglyphics in Mayan codices. It is {{normally}} connected with either death or as a bird of prey. The vulture's glyph is often shown attacking humans. This species lacks the religious connections that the <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> has. While some of the glyphs clearly show the black vulture's open nostril and hooked beak, some are assumed to be this species because they are vulture-like but lack the king vulture's knob and are painted black. This vulture has appeared on two stamps: those of Guyana in 1990 and Nicaragua in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture {{feeds on}} carrion and locates {{carcasses}} by sight and by smell, an ability which {{is rare in}} birds. It is dependent on larger vultures, such as the <b>king</b> <b>vulture,</b> to open the hides of larger animal carcasses, as its bill is {{not strong enough to}} do this. Like other New World vultures, the greater yellow-headed vulture utilizes thermals to stay aloft with minimal effort. It lays its eggs on flat surfaces, such as the floors of caves, or in the hollows of stumps. It feeds its young by regurgitation.|$|E
5|$|Coastal areas {{provide a}} {{constant}} food supply, and in particularly plentiful areas, some Andean condors limit their foraging area to several kilometers of beach-front land. They locate carrion by spotting it or by following other scavengers, such as corvids or other vultures. It may follow New World vultures {{of the genus}} Cathartes—the turkey vulture (C. aura), the lesser yellow-headed vulture (C. burrovianus), and the greater yellow-headed vulture (C. melambrotus)—to carcasses. The Cathartes vultures forage by smell, detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. These smaller vultures cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with {{the efficiency of the}} larger condor, and their interactions are often an example of mutual dependence between species. Black <b>vultures</b> (Coragyps atratus), <b>king</b> <b>vultures</b> (Sarcoramphus papa) and even mammalian scavengers may sometimes track Cathartes vultures for carcasses but the condor is invariably dominant among the scavengers in its range. Andean condors are intermittent eaters in the wild, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several pounds at once, sometimes {{to the point of being}} unable to lift off the ground. Because its feet and talons are not adapted to grasping, it must feed while on the ground. Like other carrion-feeders, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|R
50|$|India's Thar Desert {{spans the}} western states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. More people live here {{than in any other}} desert, with a {{population}} density 100 times that of the Sahara, and growing all the time. Fortunately the people of the desert look favourably on their wild neighbours, as demonstrated by the villagers of Khichan, who feed large flocks of demoiselle cranes over the winter. The birds are revered as symbols of fortune. Thapar visits a desert dwelling of the Bishnoi people, strict vegetarians and guardians of the animal population. Despite this, poaching is rife and the blackbucks, filmed in the breeding season, are being increasingly marginalised. The chinkara or Indian gazelle is an even hardier animal, getting all the moisture it needs from plants and the morning dew. Wolves and jackals are also shown. Around a camp fire, the nocturnal inhabitants of the desert are filmed as they emerge from the sand: dung beetles, gerbils and predatory saw scaled vipers and scorpions. The people of Jodhpur are vegetarians but use domesticated oxen, camels and buffalo as working animals. When they die, the carcasses are taken {{to the edge of the}} city and left as food for scavengers, among them Asian <b>king</b> <b>vultures,</b> Indian white-rumped vultures and griffon vultures. Waterholes attract many animals before they dry up during the heat of summer. It is also used by people and their livestock for washing and drinking. Birds shown include pied kingfisher, red-wattled lapwing and black-winged stilt. To escape egrets, frogs hop across the surface of the water. At night, climbing perch leave the water and travel across land to find other pools, and an ingenious ratel uses logs to reach a stricken kingfisher chick. The most extreme environment is the Rann of Kutch salt flats where only the monsoon brings relief to the last population of Indian wild asses. In the closing scenes, Thapar observes flocks of flamingos which come to the salt flats in times of flood.|$|R
50|$|The Bribri spiritual {{practice}} centers {{about the}} conical house. Conical houses {{can be found}} in many amazonian groups belonging to the Macro-chibchan language family. The conical house is a symbolic representation of the universe. It is supported by eight pillars symbolizing the animals that helped Sibu construct the Universe. The house has four levels representing the four levels of the world, being the ground level the plane we inhabit. On the second level dwell the spirits of plants and animals, and the owners of the rivers, this is where Sibu's helpers live. On the third level of the universe live the spirits who cause disease and suffering and descend periodically to cause grief on earth. The final and highest level of the conical house is where Sibu, accompanied by his helper the <b>king</b> of <b>vultures</b> lives. In this same level live the most malign spirits as well. The Bribri explanation for this is that Sibu keeps them enclosed there, like a warden keeps the inmates in a prison. There are also three other levels beneath the world we inhabit. One of them is the place where Bribri souls go after death.|$|R
5|$|The <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common species of birds {{represented}} in the Maya codices. Its glyph is easily distinguishable by the knob on the bird's beak and by the concentric circles that make up the bird's eyes. Sometimes the bird is portrayed as a god with a human body and a bird head. According to Maya mythology, this god often carried messages between humans and the other gods. It may also be used to represent Cozcacuauhtli, the thirteenth day of the month in the Aztec calendar (13 Reed). An ocellated turkey (Meleagris ocellata) was also considered to be the bird depicted, but the hooked bill and wattle point to the raptor.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} behaviour of the <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> {{in the wild}} is poorly known, and much knowledge has been gained from observing birds in captivity, particularly at the Paris Menagerie. An adult <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> sexually matures when it is {{about four or five}} years old, with females maturing slightly earlier than males. The birds mainly breed during the dry season. King vultures mate for life and generally lay a single unmarked white egg in its nest in a hollow in a tree. To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling. Both parents incubate the egg for the 52 to 58 days before it hatches. If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood. The young are semi-altricial—they are helpless when born but are covered in downy feathers (truly altricial birds are born naked), and their eyes are open at birth. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, and able to beg and wriggle around the nest, and preen themselves and peck by their third day. They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10, and stand on their toes by day 20. From one to three months of age, chicks walk around and explore the vicinity of the nest, and take their first flights at about three months of age.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its size}} and gaudy coloration, this vulture is quite {{inconspicuous}} when it is perched in trees. While perched, it holds its head lowered and thrust forward. It is non-migratory and, unlike the turkey, lesser yellow-headed and American black vulture, it generally lives alone or in small family groups. Groups of up to 12 birds have been observed bathing and drinking in a pool above a waterfall in Belize. One or two birds generally descend to feed at a carcass, although occasionally up to ten or so may gather if there is significant amount of food. King vultures have lived up to 30 years in captivity, though their lifespan in the wild is unknown. This vulture uses urohidrosis, defecating on its legs, to lower its body temperature. Despite its bill and large size, it is relatively unaggressive at a kill. The <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> lacks a voice box, although it can make low croaking noises and wheezing sounds in courtship, and bill-snapping noises when threatened. Its only natural predators are snakes, which will prey upon the vulture's eggs and young, and large cats such as jaguars, which may surprise and kill an adult vulture at a carcass.|$|E
60|$|The {{struggle}} between Liberty and Authority {{is the most}} conspicuous feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar, particularly in that of Greece, Rome, and England. But in old times this contest was between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the government. By liberty, was meant protection against {{the tyranny of the}} political rulers. The rulers were conceived (except in some of the popular governments of Greece) as in a necessarily antagonistic position to the people whom they ruled. They consisted of a governing One, or a governing tribe or caste, who derived their authority from inheritance or conquest, who, at all events, did not hold it at the pleasure of the governed, and whose supremacy men did not venture, perhaps did not desire, to contest, whatever precautions might be taken against its oppressive exercise. Their power was regarded as necessary, but also as highly dangerous; as a weapon which they would attempt to use against their subjects, no less than against external enemies. To prevent the weaker members of the community from being preyed upon by innumerable vultures, it was needful that there should be an animal of prey stronger than the rest, commissioned to keep them down. But as the <b>king</b> of the <b>vultures</b> would be no less bent upon preying on the flock than any of the minor harpies, it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude of defence against his beak and claws. The aim, therefore, of patriots, was to set limits to the power which the ruler should be suffered to exercise over the community; and this limitation was what they meant by liberty. It was attempted in two ways. First, by obtaining a recognition of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights, which it was to be regarded as a breach of duty in the ruler to infringe, and which if he did infringe, specific resistance, or general rebellion, was held to be justifiable. A second, and generally a later expedient, was the establishment of constitutional checks; by which the consent of the community, or of a body of some sort, supposed to represent its interests, was made a necessary condition to some of the more important acts of the governing power. To the first of these modes of limitation, the ruling power, in most European countries, was compelled, more or less, to submit. It was not so with the second; and to attain this, or when already in some degree possessed, to attain it more completely, became everywhere the principal object of the lovers of liberty. And so long as mankind were content to combat one enemy by another, and to be ruled by a master, on condition of being guaranteed more or less efficaciously against his tyranny, they did not carry their aspirations beyond this point.|$|R
25|$|Birds include <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> (Sarcoramphus papa), {{mantled hawk}} (Pseudastur polionotus), blue-fronted amazon (Amazona aestiva) and vinaceous-breasted amazon (Amazona vinacea).|$|E
25|$|The Andean condor {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{recognized}} species in the area; as of 2007, 101 Andean condors remained in the region. The <b>king</b> <b>vulture</b> (Sarcoramphus papa) has also been spotted in Pampa de Achala.|$|E
