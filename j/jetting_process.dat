During the time period immediately following, called the Long Shutdown 1, the LHC was turned off {{to allow for the}} upgrade of the hardware of the experiments and the collider for a restart at √s = 13 TeV. This thesis focuses on two topics. The first is the construction and testing of new Cathode Strip Chambers which were installed in the Compact Muon Solenoid. The second is a measurement of the cross sections of the Z/γ∗ + jets and γ + <b>jets</b> <b>processes,</b> where the Z decays to either an electron-positron pair (e+e−) or a muon pair (μ+μ−), the ratio of the cross sections of the Z/γ∗ + <b>jets</b> <b>process</b> to the γ + <b>jets</b> <b>process,</b> and the shapes of the Z/γ∗ + jets events, namely the azimuthal angle φ between the Z boson and the three leading jets.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{behaviour}} of the inclusive jet, W+jets and Z+jets processes from the phenomenological and experimental {{point of view in}} the ATLAS experiment at LHC in order to understand how important is the impact of Sudakov logarithms on electroweak corrections and in the associated production of weak vector boson and jets at LHC. We have computed the amplitude of the real electroweak corrections to the inclusive <b>jet</b> <b>process</b> due to the real emission of weak vector bosons from jets. We have done this computation with the MCFM and NLOjet++ generators at 7 TeV, 8 TeV and 14 TeV. This study shows that, for the inclusive <b>jet</b> <b>process,</b> the partial cancellation of the virtual weak corrections (due to weak bosons in loops) by the real electroweak corrections occurs. This effect shows that Bloch-Nordsieck violation is reduced for this process. We have then participated to the measure of the differential cross-section for these different processes in the ATLAS experiment at 7 TeV. In particular we have been involved into technical aspects of the measurement such as the study of the QCD background to the W+jets process in the muon channel. We have then combined the different measurements in this channel to compare their behaviour. This tends to show that several effects are giving to the electroweak corrections their relative importance as we see an increase of the relative contribution of weak bosons with <b>jets</b> <b>processes</b> to the inclusive <b>jet</b> <b>process</b> with the transverse momentum of jets, if we explicitely ask for the presence of electroweak bosons in the final state. This study is currently only a preliminary study and aims at showing that this study can be useful to investigate the underlying structure of these processes. Finally we {{have studied the}} noises affecting the ATLAS calorimeter. This has allowed {{for the development of a}} new way to detect problematic events using well known theorems from statistics.

40|$|Piezo drop-on-demand inkjet {{printers}} {{are used in}} {{an increasing number of}} applications because of their reliable deposition of droplets onto a substrate. Droplets of a few picoliters are ejected from an inkjet nozzle at frequencies of up to 100 kHz. However, the entrapment of an air microbubble in the ink channel can severely impede the productivity and reliability of the printing system. The air bubble disturbs the channel acoustics, resulting in disrupted drop formation or failure of the <b>jetting</b> <b>process.</b> Here we study a micro-electro-mechanical systems-based printhead. By using the actuating piezo transducer in receive mode, the acoustical field inside the channel was monitored, clearly identifying the presence of an air microbubble inside the channel during failure of the <b>jetting</b> <b>process.</b> The infrared visualization technique allowed for the accurate sizing of the bubble, including its dynamics, inside the intact printhead. A model was developed to calculate the mutual interaction between the channel acoustics and the bubble dynamics. The model was validated by simultaneous acoustical and infrared detection of the bubble. The model can predict the presence and size of entrapped air bubbles inside an operating ink channel purely from the acoustic response. ...|$|E

The presence of a vector boson in the hard scatter means that these interactions occur at a scale that should make perturbative QCD applicable, and thus it is an excellent channel to test such predictions.

40|$|In the Middle East, {{extended}} reach horizontal wells (on {{the order}} of 25, 000 feet of horizontal displacement) are commonly acid stimulated by jetting acid out of drill pipe. The acid is jetted onto {{the face of the}} openhole wellbore as the drill pipe is withdrawn from the well. The jetting action helps to remove the drilling fluid filter cake and promote the acid to penetrate into the formation and form wormholes to stimulate the well. However, with very long sections of wellbore open to flow, the acid placement and subsequent wormhole distribution and penetration depths are uncertain. This study has modeled the acid <b>jetting</b> <b>process</b> using a comprehensive model of acid placement and wormhole propagation in a horizontal well. It is presumed that the acid jetting tool removes the drilling mud filter cake, so that no filter cake exists between the end of the drill pipe and the toe of the well. Correspondingly, the model also assumes that there is an intact, low-permeability filter cake on the borehole wall between the end of the drill pipe and the heel of the well. The drill pipe is modeled as being withdrawn from the well during the acid jetting treatment, as is done in practice. The acidizing simulator predicts the distribution of acid and the depths of wormholes formed as functions of time and position during the acid jetting treatment. The model shows that the acid <b>jetting</b> <b>process</b> as typically applied in these wells preferentially stimulates the toe region of the horizontal well. Comparisons of the simulation predictions with published data for acid jetting treatments in such wells showed good general agreement.

40|$|Abstract—A {{new type}} of {{underwater}} thruster was designed to provide high-accuracy, low-speed maneuvering to underwater robots. Located internal to the vehicle surface, these thrusters have a minimal effect on the forward-drag profile of the vehicle. These thrusters, whose inspiration comes from the natural propulsion of cephalopods and jellyfish, generate control forces by successive in-gestion and expulsion of jets of water from a cavity mounted in the hull of the vehicle. The <b>jetting</b> <b>process</b> has no net mass flux but re-sults in a positive momentum flux. A time-dependent thrust model was developed, which predicted the thruster dynamics as a func-tion of time, actuation frequency, and thruster-driving parameters.

Upon consideration of the detonation front propagation along the lateral length of the core charge in LSCs (linear shaped charges), a further modification of the Birkhoff theory motivated by the unique geometrical condition of LSCs and the α = β condition is necessary to correctly describe the jetting behavior of LSCs which is different than that of CSCs (conical shaped charges). Based on such unique geometrical properties of LSCs, the original Birkhoff theory was modified and an analytical steady state LSCs model was built.
