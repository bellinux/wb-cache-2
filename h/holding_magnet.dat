These methods had the disadvantage of blocking all outgoing calls from that line until it was manually cleared.

5000|$|Crossbar {{switches}} use switching matrices {{made from}} a two-dimensional array of contacts arranged in an x-y format. These switching matrices are operated {{by a series of}} horizontal bars arranged over the contacts. Each such [...] "select" [...] bar can be rocked up or down by electromagnets to provide access to two levels of the matrix. A second set of vertical [...] "hold" [...] bars is set at right angles to the first (hence the name, [...] "crossbar") and also operated by electromagnets. The select bars carry spring-loaded wire fingers that enable the hold bars to operate the contacts beneath the bars. When the select and then the hold electromagnets operate in sequence to move the bars, they trap one of the spring fingers to close the contacts beneath the point where two bars cross. This then makes the connection through the switch as part of setting up a calling path through the exchange. Once connected, the select magnet is then released so it can use its other fingers for other connections, while the <b>hold</b> <b>magnet</b> remains energized {{for the duration of the}} call to maintain the connection.

40|$|Nanoscale <b>magnets</b> <b>hold</b> {{great promise}} {{in a wide}} range of {{electronic}} technologies. They are needed for improving the performance of microwave filters, power supplies, etc. Although nanoscale magnets have been synthesized for many years, the magnetic particles have generally been produced with a broad size distribution and poor crystallinity, whereas most applications require particles with a narrow size distribution (monodisperse particles) and a very low structural disorder in order to have magnetic characteristics, such as saturation magnetization, as close as possible to those of bulk samples. We have succeeded in preparing nanoscale manganese zinc ferrite (MZFO) monodisperse particles with good crystallinity by using forced hydrolysis in a polyol. This is a novel preparative route to powdery oxide materials developed in our laboratory, as an alternative sol-gel chimie douce method. It consists in the hydrolysis of metallic salts dissolved and heated in a polyol. Polyols are crystal growth media of particular interest for the synthesis of fine particles with a narrow size distribution and high crystallinity [1 - 3]. Such features, in the case of ferrimagnetic oxide nanocrystals, are related to improved magnetic characteristics [4; 5].

40|$|Abstract. Machining {{of metals}} is {{generally}} {{accompanied by a}} violent relative vibration between work and tool, known as chatter.

40|$|Abstract. Chatter {{is almost}} an {{unavoidable}} phenomenon during machining, normally {{accompanied by a}} characteristic sharp and monotonous noise. Apart from noise pollution in the industry, chatter leaves a bad surface finish on the part and negatively influences dimensional tolerances, reduced productivity, excessive tool wear and damaged machine-tool components. Therefore, chatter avoidance is utmost importance. However, a deeper investigation into chatter formation reveals that chatter appears during metal cutting process {{as a result of}} resonance caused by interaction of the prominent natural frequencies of the system with the frequency of chip serration. This paper presents an innovative approach to chatter suppression during turning of stainless steel AISI 304 applying permanent magnet {{from the bottom of the}} tool holder to increase the damping coefficient of the tool holder, since it has been identified that the tool holder is the main vibrating component during turning.

40|$|Although {{the ideal}} and {{universal}} support system {{has not been}} invented yet, there are many implementations which fulfill most of alignment's requirements. However, inventing a new support system seems to represent the last design challenge, why would we otherwise witness so many new attempts. Already Plato reminded his scholars that one should learn from the past. Unfortunately, learning from previous designs and implementations doesn't seem to carry much attraction. Or it is that we, the customers, are not doing our job by letting the design engineer know what {{we would like to}} see done, what we think works, and what is already there. This contribution is an initiative to create a reference for support systems which exist in our laboratories and we know do work. Such an undertaking will require everybody's active support and feedback. I already have to thank my peers at many laboratories who helped me put together this first draft. Only if a more or less complete library of existing designs can be compiled with easy access to drawings can we then hope that the support system design competition looses its challenge. As alignment tolerances get ever tighter, the interplay of alignment with mechanical engineering becomes ever more important. In fact, accelerator alignment has advanced so far that mechanical uncertainties now exceed observational uncertainties. Of the mechanical issues bearing upon alignment, one of the most crucial is the magnet supports; these must provide both stability and a fineness of motion substantially exceeding the final alignment tolerances. Magnet supports are the interface that allows mechanical mounting of components and their subsequent alignment to a nominal position in three-dimensional space. Supports thus provide two functions: that of a spacer to bring the component close to its ideal position, and that of a fine motion system to enable the surveyor to move the component to its ideal location within the required tolerance. It is essential to understand that Magnets, Supports, and Survey and Alignment are interrelated. Ideally, one person would be responsible for all these functions. In larger projects, beyond the scope of one such manager, the responsible parties must be in regular communication. A magnet designed without supports in mind can be quite impossible to hold onto. A support system that <b>holds</b> the <b>magnets</b> up, but requires a hammer to operate, renders impossible the achievement of tight tolerances.

40|$|The first NASA scout {{mission to}} Mars, Phoenix, {{launched}} 4 August will {{land in the}} northern part of Mars in the locality of 68 °N and 233 °E on 25 May 2008. Part, of the science payload is the Magnetic Properties Experiments (MPE) that consists of two main experiments: the Improved Sweep Magnet Experiment (ISWEEP) and 10 sets of two Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer (MECA) magnet substrates with embedded permanent magnets of different strength. The ISWEEP experiment is, as the name indicates, an improved version of the Sweep Magnet Experiments flown onboard the two Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs) Spirit and Opportunity. The sweep magnet is ring shaped and is designed to allow only nonmagnetic particles to enter a small circular area at the center of the surface of this structure. Results from this experiment have shown that on the MERs hardly any particles can be detected in the central area of this ring-shaped magnet. From this we have concluded that essentially all particles in the Martian atmosphere are magnetic in the sense that they are attracted to permanent magnets. In order to improve the sensitivity of the Sweep Magnet Experiment for detection of nonmagnetic or very weakly magnetic particles, the ISWEEP <b>holds</b> six ring-shaped <b>magnets,</b> somewhat larger than the sweep magnet of the MERs, and with six different background colors in the central area. The six different colors provide new possibilities for improved contrast between these background colors, i. e., any putative nonmagnetic particles should render these more easily detectable. The Surface Stereo Imager will also take advantage of the small clean areas in the ISWEEPs and use the presumably constant colors for radiometric calibration of images. The MECA magnets work as substrates in the MECA microscopy experiments; they are built to attract and hold magnetic particles from dust samples. The collected dust will then be examined by the optical microscope and the atomic force microscope in the MECA package. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R
