5|$|In this section, Heilmann draws {{evidence}} from his observations of <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> impregnation, cell division, ontogeny and comparative embryology about the probable ancestry of birds. A {{fair amount of}} detail is devoted early in the section to comparative studies between the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> of many different species of extant bird and reptile (and several mammals), including some comments on the corkscrew locomotion observed in the spermatozoa cells of several bird and reptile species, but no mammals. He {{then goes on to}} offer a similar comparison between the egg cells of birds and reptiles, and finds considerably more similarity there than either has to the egg cell of a mammal. Following an analysis of the <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> he moves onward through the developmental cycle by next examining the process of fertilization and subsequent cleavage of the zygote. He presents here several figures and illustrations of the cleavage of the blastoderm in reptiles and birds.|$|E
5|$|Cell theory led {{biologists}} to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages {{of individual}} cells. Scientists in the rising field of cytology, armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new staining methods, soon {{found that even}} single cells were far {{more complex than the}} homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. Robert Brown had described the nucleus in 1831, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: chromosomes, centrosomes mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other structures made visible through staining. Between 1874 and 1884 Walther Flemming described the discrete stages of mitosis, showing that they were not artifacts of staining but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a daughter cell was produced. Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in August Weismann's theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between somatic cells and <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> a precursor to the concept of meiosis), and adopted Hugo de Vries's theory of pangenes. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental embryology.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are unisexual {{but some}} stony corals are hermaphrodite. The <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> {{originate in the}} endoderm {{and move to the}} gastrodermis where they differentiate. When mature, they are liberated into the coelenteron and thence to the open sea, with fertilisation being external. To make fertilisation more likely, corals emit vast numbers of gametes, and many species synchronise their release in relation to the time of day and the phase of the moon.|$|E
50|$|Intratubular <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia, {{abbreviated}} ITGCN or IGCN {{and also}} known as testicular intratubular <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia and intratubular <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia of the testis, is considered a precursor lesion for many types of testicular <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors.|$|R

40|$|<b>Germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors occur {{mostly in}} the gonad. Extragonadal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors are rare, and most occur in the retroperitoneum and mediastinum. Primary mediastinal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors are often found in the {{anterior}} portion of the mediastinum and include teratomas and non-teratomatous tumors. Non-teratomatous tumors include seminomas and malignant non-seminomatous <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors (MNSGCTs). MNSGCTs include yolk sac tumors, choriocarcinomas, embryonal carcinomas, and mixed type <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors. Teratomas {{are the most common}} <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors of the mediastinum, and seminomas are the most common non-teratomatous <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors of the mediastinum. Cases of primary mediastinal MNSGCT reported in the literature are rare. In this report, we review all primary mediastinal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors from a 10 -year period at the Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital of Kaohsiung Medical University. A total of 14 cases were reviewed, including 11 patients with mature teratomas, two with yolk sac tumors, and one with seminoma. We discuss the differences in clinical presentation, histopathologic characteristics, treatment, and prognosis...|$|R
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the hartebeest is 40. Hybrids are usually reported from areas where ranges of two subspecies overlap. Hybrids between the Lelwel and Tora hartebeest {{have been reported}} in eastern Sudan and western Ethiopia, in a stretch southward from the Blue Nile to about 9° N latitude. A study proved a male hybrid of the red hartebeest and the blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus) to be sterile. Sterility of the hybrid was attributed to difficulties in segregation during meiosis, indicated by azoospermia and a low number of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in its seminiferous tubules.|$|E
5|$|Coalitions between organisms of {{the same}} species have also evolved. An extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects, such as bees, {{termites}} and ants, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth causes cancer.|$|E
5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E
50|$|In females, <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors {{account for}} 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 1 to 3% of ovarian cancers in North America. In younger women <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors are more common, thus in {{patients}} {{under the age}} of 21, 60% of ovarian tumors are of the <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> type, and up to one-third are malignant. In males, <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors of the testis occur typically after puberty and are malignant (testicular cancer). In neonates, infants, and children younger than 4 years, the majority of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors are sacrococcygeal teratomas.|$|R
5000|$|The nongerminomatous or nonseminomatous <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors (NGGCT, NSGCT) {{include all}} other <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors, pure and mixed.|$|R
50|$|Malignant <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> {{tumors of the}} {{mediastinum}} are uncommon, representing only 3 to 10% of tumors {{originating in}} the mediastinum. They are much less common than <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors arising in the testes, and account for only 1 to 5% of all <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasms.|$|R
5|$|The {{duplication}} {{and transmission}} of genetic material {{from one generation}} of cells to the next {{is the basis for}} molecular inheritance, and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes. Organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because the cells of the offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents' cells. In asexually reproducing organisms, the offspring will be a genetic copy or clone of the parent organism. In sexually reproducing organisms, a specialized form of cell division called meiosis produces cells called gametes or <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> that are haploid, or contain only one copy of each gene. The gametes produced by females are called eggs or ova, and those produced by males are called sperm. Two gametes fuse to form a diploid fertilized egg, a single cell that has two sets of genes, with one copy of each gene from the mother and one from the father.|$|E
5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} cavity forms: a {{mouth that}} {{can usually be}} closed by muscles; a pharynx ("throat"); a wider area in the center {{that acts as a}} stomach; and a system of internal canals. These branch through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal: the mouth and pharynx; the roots of the tentacles, if present; all along the underside of each comb row; and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth – two of these four branches terminate in anal pores. The inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium, the gastrodermis. The mouth and pharynx have both cilia and well-developed muscles. In other parts of the canal system, the gastrodermis is different on the sides nearest to and furthest from the organ that it supplies. The nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells that store nutrients in vacuoles (internal compartments), <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> that produce eggs or sperm, and photocytes that produce bioluminescence. The side furthest from the organ is covered with ciliated cells that circulate water through the canals, punctuated by ciliary rosettes, pores that are surrounded by double whorls of cilia and connect to the mesoglea.|$|E
40|$|Mediastinal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> {{tumors are}} extragonadal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors (EGGCTs) {{commonly}} seen {{in children and}} young adults. They are more common in men. Clinically they are classified as teratomas, seminomas, and nonseminomatous <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors. Primary mediastinal yolk sac neoplasm is an extremely rare tumor. We present here a very rare case of primary yolk sac tumor of the anterior mediastinum in a 73 -year-old male. Mediastinal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors have a worse prognosis than gonadal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors. Chemotherapy followed by adjuvant surgery improves overall response in EGGCTs. However, comorbidities can render treatment with chemotherapy and surgery challenging in elderly patients...|$|R
40|$|<b>Germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors of ovary with {{elements}} {{of two or}} more subtypes are relatively uncommon. Sarcoid-like granulomas are seen in rare association with dysgerminomas, a subgroup of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors of ovary, which are again less common. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the gonadal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumor, though not performed frequently, is of help when a gonadal mass does not require resection as in lymphoma which can be treated by chemotherapy. FNAC helps to diagnose this tumor and to rule out other lesions, including <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors. It is also an effective, rapid and reliable procedure for the diagnosis of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors...|$|R
40|$|As {{reviewed}} in Chapter 1, testicular <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors {{can be divided}} into seminomas, composed of neoplastic gonocytes, and nonseminomas, pluripotent tumors which can be considered as the neoplastic counterpart of early embryos. The <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> origin of these tumors is firmly established, and current concepts consider intratubular <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia as the preinvasive stage of all adult testicular <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors {{with the possible exception of}} spermatocytic seminoma.

5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of reproductive heritability and {{the origin of}} new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of pangenesis. In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the independent assortment and segregation of elements (later known as genes). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory. August Weismann made the important distinction between <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> {{that give rise to}} gametes (such as sperm and egg cells) and the somatic cells of the body, demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only. Hugo de Vries connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the cell nucleus and when expressed they could move into the cytoplasm to change the cells structure. De Vries {{was also one of the}} researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory, genetic mutations, and Mendelian inheritance was thus reconciled.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{causes of}} {{congenital}} anomalies include inheritance of abnormal genes {{from the mother}} or the father, {{as well as new}} mutations in one of the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> that gave rise to the fetus. Male <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> mutate at a much faster rate than female <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> and as the father ages, the DNA of the <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> mutates quickly. If an egg is fertilized with sperm that has damaged DNA, {{there is a possibility that}} the fetus could develop abnormally.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{paternal}} age on offspring {{are not yet}} well understood and are studied far less extensively than the effects of maternal age. Fathers contribute proportionally more DNA mutations to their offspring via their <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> than the mother, with the paternal age governing how many mutations are passed on. This is because, as humans age, male <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> acquire mutations at a much faster rate than female <b>germ</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E

40|$|Data from {{cytogenetics}} of testicular, ovarian and extragonadal <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumours {{indicate that}} the group of <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumours for which Skakkebaek proposed the name gonocytoma (seminoma, dysgerminoma and germinoma) {{is characterized by the}} presence of isochromosome 12 p. The (dysplastic) gonocytes from which these tumours are derived are prone to polyploidization, especially in the gonads. There is evidence that non-seminomatous <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumours in the testis may evolve through a (subclinical?) gonocytoma stage by loss of chromosomes. Since gonocytomas have already acquired the i(12 p) marker, evolution of non-seminomatous <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumours from gonocytomas would explain the presence of i(12 p) in non-seminomatous <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumours of the adult testis. A similar evolution may account for the presence of i(12 p) in testicular type non-seminomatous <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumours occurring in the ovary and extragonadally...|$|R
25|$|Spermatocytic seminoma is not {{considered}} a subtype of seminoma and, unlike seminoma and most other <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumours, it does not arise from intratubular <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> neoplasia. It has not been described as arising in locations outside the testis, and does not occur in association with other <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumours.|$|R
25|$|Multipotent {{stem cells}} {{have also been}} derived from <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> found in human testicles.|$|E
25|$|They are {{composed}} of cells that cannot differentiate further and develop directly from <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> or from gonadoblastomas. Dysgerminomas contain syncytiotrophoblasts in approximately 5% of cases, and can therefore cause elevated hCG levels. On gross appearance, dysgerminomas are typically pink to tan-colored, have multiple lobes, and are solid. Microscopically, they appear identical to seminomas and very close to embryonic primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells,</b> having large, polyhedral, rounded clear cells. The nuclei are uniform and round or square with prominent nucleoli and the cytoplasm has high levels of glycogen. Inflammation is another prominent histologic feature of dysgerminomas.|$|E
25|$|The testes {{begin as}} an {{immigration}} of primordial <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> into testicular cords along the gonadal ridge in the abdomen {{of the early}} embryo. The interaction of several male genes organizes this developing gonad into a testis rather than an ovary by the second month of gestation. During the 3rd to 5th months, the cells in the testes differentiate into testosterone-producing Leydig cells, and anti-Müllerian hormone-producing Sertoli cells. The <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> in this environment become fetal spermatogonia. Male external genitalia develop during the 3rd and 4th months of gestation and the fetus continues to grow, develop, and differentiate.|$|E

25|$|Germ cell {{neoplasia}} in situ, abbreviated GCNIS, {{represents the}} precursor lesion for {{many types of}} testicular germ cell tumors. As the name suggests, it represents a neoplastic process of <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> that is confined to the spermatogonial niche.|$|E
25|$|During meiosis, when <b>germ</b> <b>cells</b> divide {{to create}} sperm and egg (gametes), each half {{should have the}} same number of {{chromosomes}}. But sometimes, the whole pair of chromosomes will end up in one gamete, and the other gamete will not get that chromosome at all.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Germ</b> <b>cell</b> {{tumors are}} rare and complex group of {{heterogenous}} neoplasms that comprise both benign and malignant histology. The testes and ovaries {{are the most}} common sites. This descriptive study focused on distribution of malignant <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors with more detail study of ovarian malignant <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors. Materials and Methods: All cases of malignant <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumor reported from department of pathology of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital over five years from April 2007 to April 2012 were included in the study. Results: Thirty five cases (24 female and 11 male) were diagnosed as having malignant <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors. Most patients were below 30 years of age. Ovary was the most common site followed by testes. Malignant ovarian <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumor comprised 54. 3 % of all malignant <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors. Age of these patients ranged from 6 years to 32 years. Most common histologic type was yolk sac tumor. Conclusion: Malignant <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors can be seen in any age group from new born to old age. However malignant ovarian <b>germ</b> <b>cell</b> tumors occur mainly in first three decades of life, are mostly unilateral and are of large size at the time of diagnosis due to rapid growth. However these tumors are often of low stage and managed with conservative surgery. Journal of Pathology of Nepal (2012) Vol. 2, 289 - 292 DOI: [URL]...|$|R
