Using survey data collected by the authors, this paper examines a host of factors which influence migrant workers’ participation in the old-age scheme. The result shows that individual characteristics, employment status, attitudes toward old-age support and perception of the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system significantly differentiate two groups of migrant workers between those that have participated in and their counterparts who have not participated in the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> <b>schemes.</b> Among a number of factors, age, educational attainment, holding labor contract, etc. {{are found to be}} significant factors influencing migrants’ behavior participating (or not participating) the available age-pension schemes.

Individuals with a minimum of 10 years covered under the national <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> and who are 60 years of age are able to be covered by under a 'reduced old-age pension' scheme.

40|$|The topicality of the {{research}} subject. The foundations of the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> based on notional accounts, {{also referred to as}} the "notional defined contribution" or "non-financial defined contribution" (NDC) <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> <b>scheme,</b> were laid in Sweden in 1994, when the prevailing view was that a sus­tainable defined-contribution PAYG <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> is impossible. Since then, the NDC system modifications have been implemented in several countries; since 2000, this scheme is also part of the Latvian pension system and works significantly better than {{the other part of the}} pension system - the funded <b>pension</b> <b>scheme.</b> However, the sustainability of NDC scheme is still being questioned. To prevent the NDC pension system sustainability problems, the authors (Pukis, M., & Dundure, I., 2012) in their publication "The Sustainability of the Pension System in Latvia" and (Dundure, I., 2015), the article "Sustainable <b>Old-age</b> <b>Pension</b> System by Developing Notional Defined Contribution Pension Scheme" have proposed a modified NDC model that provides sustainability of the pension system considering the known risks inherent in the pension system. The aim of the paper is to research and analyse the conditions for building a sustainable pension system by developing a Notional Defined Contribution <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> and working out an adjusted (modified) <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> calculation formula. In order to achieve the above mentioned aim, the authors set the following tasks:Define the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system based on NDC principles;Define the primary objectives of pension systems and perform analysis of pension adequacy;Define the conditions for achieving a sustainable <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system based on NDC principles;Develop an adjusted (modified) <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> calculation formula based on NDC principles. In order to achieve the established aim and tasks, the following scientific research methods have been used in the work: analytical method, comparative method, logically and abstractedly constructive method. The analytical method and the comparative method are employed for conducting pension adequacy analysis and examination of pension capital indexation and indexation of pensions after retirement, as well as for the purpose of studying the Notional Defined Contribution pension system. The logically and abstractedly constructive method is employed for making forecasts and defining the main research results – the conditions for ensuring pension system sustainability that have been determined by the authors in the course of {{the research}}.

For data-related reasons, {{analyses of the}} personal wealth distribution have so far failed to take this into account, however. According to recent calculations based on the 2007 data of the German Socio- Economic Panel (SOEP), {{the present value of}} total pension and state annuity entitlements (not including entitlements to provision for dependants) amounted to roughly 4. 6 trillion euros. This corresponds to an average of 67, 000 euros per adult. When this is combined with individuals' financial and material assets, which amount to an average of 88, 000 euros, the result is a more comprehensive total net worth of more than 155, 000 euros. Civil servants and retired civil servants fare better than average if this larger view is taken. This more comprehensive measurement shows considerably less inequality of wealth than traditional analyses, which refer only to financial and material assets. This is not least because of the very widespread existence of entitlements under the various <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> <b>schemes</b> with simultaneous capping based on the contribution assessment threshold for statutory <b>pension</b> <b>schemes.</b> Nevertheless, wealth continues to be highly concentrated, and the mitigating effects of <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> assets will likely become less important in the future.

The {{purpose of this article is}} to map and conduct a comparative analysis of the administrative design of public–private partnerships (PPPs) in European pension regimes, with a specific focus on how accountabilities are institutionally enforced within the PPP design. Previous literature has recognized accountability as an important factor in promoting trust in mandated <b>pension</b> <b>schemes.</b> However, as the literature on PPPs suggests, institutional arrangements of accountability are more complex in the case of PPPs than has been suggested by previous studies on pension administration.

40|$|This paper uses an impulse-response {{function}} {{approach to}} assess the magnitude and persistence {{of the effects of}} downturns on labour force participation for a sample of 30 countries over the period 1960 - 2008. Past severe recessions appear to have had a significant and persistent impact on participation, while moderate downturns did not. The aggregate participation rate effect of severe downturns peaked on average at about 1 ½ to 2 ½ percentage points five to eight years after the cyclical peak, and was still significant after almost a decade. Youths and older workers account for the bulk of this effect. Institutional and policy settings are found to be an important factor having shaped the response of participation to economic downturns. In particular, early retirement incentives embedded in <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> <b>schemes</b> and other social transfer programmes are found to amplify the responsiveness of older workers’ participation to economic conditions. However, the findings in this paper do not seem to apply to the most recent crisis, partly because the labour market situation did not deteriorate as much as the magnitude of the recession would have suggested in a number of OECD countries...|$|R
40|$|The paper aims {{to compare}} the {{preferences}} of the unlimited rational economic agent for consumption and earnings, on the one hand, and real behavior of economic agents, on the other. The analysis concludes that old-age poverty {{appears to be a}} result of irrational behavior in youth and adulthood. The state pension system, which aims to solve this problem, requires a transition of the state from its redistribution function to prevention of irrational behavior of economic agents, as well as a transition from the tax distribution system to the mandatory <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> saving <b>scheme,</b> which involves sovereignty of the individual and free choice between insurance and non-insurance alternatives. The main principles of the individually funded pension system are discussed in the paper. Minimum pension fund is expected to address the critical social issue of retirement age. The problem of long-livers, who live beyond the survival age, can be solved both by additional pension contributions to the individually funded pension system (by applying survival age multiplying coefficient) and by inclusion of insurance part in the pension system. Moreover, it has been proved that insurance scheme doesn’t reproduce redistribution system for the whole society as it is limited only to those who have the right to use pension capital.

40|$|International studies {{call for}} {{converting}} the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> <b>scheme</b> from the pay-as-you-go {{system to a}} fully funded system. Instead of immediately paying out collected contributions to old-age pensioners, {{as is the case}} in a pay-as-you-go scheme, income from contributions is to be invested in pension funds and paid out only at the time of retirement by way of a life annuity. A complete changeover to the fully funded system will cause substantial conversion costs. All <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> entitlements by insurees need to be refunded by the state either in cash or by issuing government bonds. This would bring to the fore the national debt hidden in the pension insurance system. The amount of entitlements, however, does not change by conversion to the fully funded system. Depending on whether redemption of pension claims is advanced or delayed, it is possible to redistribute the burden for current and future generations. The burden caused to future generations by the expected ageing of the population can be alleviated by advanced contributions or taxation. The effective yield of contributions paid into the pension insurance system is low for those insured today, but it shows little variation. In contrast, yields from investing in securities are markedly higher. But this gap is linked to a higher risk, i. e., capital investment may produce negative yields for several consecutive years. If Austrian households are rather risk-averse, investment of their pension portfolio in shares will lead to overall welfare loss. The low spread of share ownership and above-average concentration on income-securing measures by the welfare state are indirect indications of the general risk aversion prevailing in Austria.

As a result, population age distributions are changing markedly, with a relative increase in the numbers of elderly and a relative decrease in the numbers of young. Demographic developments in Japan are similar in important respects to those occurring among industrialized countries of the West. Japan’s demographic transition began more recently and has proceeded more rapidly. The total fertility rate is currently below 1. 3 births per woman, and life expectancy at birth is higher than in any other country.

In coming decades, rapid aging will transform it from one of the youngest populations in the OECD to among the oldest in record time.

This paper evaluates the impact of population aging on the long-term fiscal position in Korea, and assesses potential policy responses using the IMF''s Global Fiscal Model. The paper finds that the key to maintaining a sound long-run fiscal position is to act early and with a range of policy tools, including pension reform, tax base broadening (and, if necessary, rate hikes), improved tax administration and some expenditure reallocation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze the {{dynamics}} of family support and public pension systems, {{and their impact on}} late-life happiness in contemporary South Korea. For this, three specific research questions, namely (1) the dynamics of intergenerational solidarity, public pension systems, and happiness; (2) the association between intergenerational solidarity and happiness; and (3) the association between public pension systems and happiness, are analysed by exploiting the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing. The analyses show that (1) the structural solidarity of older people is relatively stronger than of middle-aged people; (2) contacting is the key player in associational solidarity in later life; (3) middle-aged people supply more financial aid to their adult children than they receive from them, but the reverse applies to older people. Both middle-aged and older people actively exchange food, household items, and health-care supplies; (4) more older men receive the National <b>Pension</b> <b>Scheme</b> benefit than older women but the reverse is true for the Basic <b>Old-Age</b> <b>Pension</b> benefit; (5) the level of happiness in later life is very high but decreases as people age; (6) the number of adult children, frequency of contact, and amount of financial support are positively associated with the happiness of older people; and (7) the National <b>Pension</b> <b>Scheme</b> is positively associated with the happiness of older men while the Basic <b>Old-Age</b> <b>Pension</b> is negatively associated with the happiness of older people. The results suggest some policy implications for late-life happiness in contemporary South Korea.

The redistributive impact of the public <b>old-age</b> <b>pension,</b> which already decreases due to aging, is largely undone by the supplementary pensions. As a consequence, the Dutch <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system is hardly redistributive for the generations born after 1970. This would imply that one of the main objectives of the public <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system has failed.

40|$|Early {{retirement}} is often explained as {{resulting from a}} voluntary labour supply choice of a utility maximizing individual. nonetheless, a lof of individuals perceive retirement as a forced instead as a voluntary decision. This paper tries to accomodate voluntary and unvoluntary labour supply decisions within one model. On {{the basis of a}} large administrative dataset merged with Census data, we estimate a discrete-time competing risk model of transitions from Belgian private-sector employees into unemployment, early and old-age retirement while accounting for forward-looking retirement incentives. The estimated coefficients are used to simulate a cut in early retirement benefits. Although this could enhance the financial sustainability of the social security system for elderly, one might expect that this may ofrce people to retire involuntarily through elderly unemployment where they end up with a lower living standard or even in poverty. Alternatively, it could stimulate employees to work longer until they qualify for <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> benefits. The model predicts a strong increase of the exit rates towards unemployment between age 52 and 57 while exit towards the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system marginally increases until age 63. In particular, blue-collars with physically demanding jobs in traditional industries have a higher risk to become unemployed while white-collar workers, members of voluntary saving plans or occupational <b>pension</b> <b>schemes</b> and highly educated workers are predicted to move in the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system. competing-risk model; early retirement; retirement pathways; involuntary retirement...|$|R
40|$|The Selected Issues {{paper on}} Finland {{underlies}} public finances and structural reform. The structural reforms encompassing labor and product markets {{as well the}} pension system would substantially improve the outlook for fiscal sustainability. Reductions in labor and product market inefficiencies is estimated, {{on the basis of}} a staff computable general equilibrium model, to raise output and employment significantly while reducing the price level. Additional pension reforms could further increase employment, boost economic growth, and improve public finances, as could improved expenditure efficiency, thereby creating room for further reductions in labor income taxation.
