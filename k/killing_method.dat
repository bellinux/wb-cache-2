25|$|The first German death camp in {{occupied}} Poland {{was established}} in late 1941 at Chełmno (renamed Kulmhof). The new <b>killing</b> <b>method</b> originated from the earlier practise of gassing thousands of unsuspecting hospital patients at Hadamar, Sonnenstein and other euthanasia centres in the Third Reich, known as Action T4. In Chełmno extermination camp, the SS Totenkopfverbände used mobile gas vans to murder mostly Polish Jews imprisoned at the Łódź Ghetto (Litzmannstadt in German). At least 152,000 people were gassed at Chełmno according to postwar verdict by West Germany, although up to 340,000 victims were estimated by the Polish Main Commission for Investigation of German Crimes in Poland (GKBZNwP), a predecessor of the Institute of National Remembrance.|$|E
500|$|The actual <b>killing</b> <b>method</b> varies {{according}} to prey species. With large prey, mature wolves usually avoid attacking frontally, instead focusing on the rear and sides of the animal. Large prey, such as moose, is killed by biting large chunks of flesh from the soft perineum area, causing massive blood loss. Such bites can cause wounds [...] in length, with three such bites to the perineum usually being sufficient to bring down a large deer in optimum health. With medium-sized prey such as roe deer or sheep, wolves kill by biting the throat, severing nerve tracks and the carotid artery, thus causing the animal to die within {{a few seconds to}} a minute. With small, mouse-like prey, wolves leap in a high arc and immobilize it with their forepaws. When prey is vulnerable and abundant, wolves may occasionally surplus kill. Such instances are common in domestic animals, but rare in the wild. In the wild, surplus killing primarily occurs during late winter or spring, when snow is unusually deep (thus impeding the movements of prey) or during the denning period, when wolves require a ready supply of meat when denbound. Medium-sized prey are especially vulnerable to surplus killing, as the swift throat-biting method by which they are killed allows wolves to quickly kill one animal and move on to another.|$|E
500|$|While the jaguar often {{employs the}} deep throat-bite and {{suffocation}} technique typical among Panthera, it sometimes uses a <b>killing</b> <b>method</b> unique amongst cats: it pierces directly through the temporal {{bones of the}} skull between the ears of prey (especially the capybara) with its canine teeth, piercing the brain. This may be an adaptation to [...] "cracking open" [...] turtle shells; following the late Pleistocene extinctions, armored reptiles such as turtles would have formed an abundant prey base for the jaguar. The skull bite is employed with mammals in particular; with reptiles such as the caiman, the jaguar may leap {{onto the back of}} the prey and sever the cervical vertebrae, immobilizing the target. When attacking sea turtles, including the huge Leatherback sea turtle which weighs about [...] on average, as they try to nest on beaches, the jaguar will bite at the head, often beheading the prey, before dragging it off to eat. Reportedly, while hunting horses, a jaguar may leap onto their back, place one paw on the muzzle and another on the nape and then twist, dislocating the neck. Local people have anecdotally reported that when hunting a pair of horses bound together, the jaguar will kill one horse and then drag it while the other horse, still living, is dragged in their wake. [...] With prey such as smaller dogs, a paw swipe to the skull may be sufficient to kill it.|$|E

2500|$|The Chełmno {{extermination}} camp (Kulmhof) was built as the first-ever, following Hitler's launch of Operation Barbarossa. It was {{a pilot project}} {{for the development of}} other extermination sites. The experiments with exhaust gases were finalized by murdering 1,500 Poles at Soldau. The <b>killing</b> <b>method</b> at Chełmno grew out of the 'euthanasia' program in which busloads of unsuspecting hospital patients were gassed in air-tight shower rooms at Bernburg, Hadamar and Sonnenstein. The killing grounds at Chełmno, [...] from Łódź, consisted of a vacated manorial estate similar to Sonnenstein, used for undressing (with a truck-loading ramp in the back), as well as a large forest clearing [...] northwest of Chełmno, used for the mass burial as well as open-pit cremation of corpses introduced some time later.|$|E
2500|$|The {{site was}} used as a [...] "buffalo jump," [...] a place where American bison could be driven up a hill and over a cliff. Prior to 1700 CE, Native Americans lacked horses. Because they {{utilized}} dogs as hunting companions and for transportation, this time period is known as the [...] "Dog Days" [...] by many tribes. Bison served as a significant food source for many Native American tribes. Killing the animals, however, was difficult, as bison are notoriously difficult to herd or capture, and can be highly aggressive. Buffalo jumps were one way to kill large numbers of the animals at once without many of the risks associated with close-proximity ambush. Once the animals were driven over the cliff and incapacitated, they would be slaughtered and their meat, hides, and bones used by the hunters to feed and clothe their families and to make various tools and weapons. Jumps were rare, as ambush was a far more common <b>killing</b> <b>method.</b> There is conflicting evidence about what time of year the jumps were used most heavily. There is some evidence that bison kills usually occurred between early fall and early spring, but evidence of unborn and young calf skeletons at the site indicate that slaughter may have occurred year-round.|$|E

5000|$|In homicidal cases, {{the term}} burking is often {{ascribed}} to a <b>killing</b> <b>method</b> that involves simultaneous smothering and compression of the torso.

50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1942, after {{replacing}} Hauptsturmführer Herbert Lange at Chełmno, Hans Bothmann made substantial changes to the camp's <b>killing</b> <b>methods.</b> The improvements were prompted by two incidents in March and April of that year. First, the gas van broke down on the highway while full of living victims. Soon after that, the Sauer van exploded while the driver was revving its engine at the loading ramp; the gassing compartment was full of living Jews. The explosion blew off the locked back door, and badly burned the victims inside. Drivers were replaced. Bothmann's modifications to the <b>killing</b> <b>methods</b> included adding poison to gasoline. There is evidence that some red powder and a fluid were delivered from Germany by Maks Sado freight company, in order to kill the victims more quickly. Another major change involved parking the gas vans while prisoners were killed. They were no longer driven {{en route to the}} forest cremation area with living victims inside.|$|R
40|$|Although {{predation}} bounty programs (rewards {{offered for}} capturing or killing an animal) ended more than 40 {{years ago in}} Canada, they were reintroduced in Alberta in 2007 by hunting, trapping, and farming organizations, municipalities and counties, and in 2009 in Saskatchewan, by municipal and provincial governments and the Saskatchewan Cattlemen’s Association. Bounty hunters use inhumane and non-selective <b>killing</b> <b>methods</b> such as shooting animals in non-vital regions, and killing neck snares and strychnine poisoning, which cause suffering and delayed deaths. They are unselective, and kill many non-target species, some of them at risk. Predator bounty programs {{have been found to}} be ineffective by wildlife professionals, and they use <b>killing</b> <b>methods</b> that cause needless suffering and jeopardize wildlife conservation programs. Our analysis therefore indicates that government agencies should not permit the implementation of bounty programs. Accordingly, they must develop conservation programs that will minimize wildlife-human conflicts, prevent the unnecessary and inhumane killing of animals, and ensure the persistence of all wildlife species...|$|R

50|$|Occasionally, and as {{suggested}} for the <b>killing</b> <b>method</b> of machairodonts, the canines actually pierce the windpipe {{and the surrounding}} blood vessels so that the tear in arteries and adjacent windpipe lead to a flow of blood into the windpipe and down into the lungs where the animal essentially drowns in its own blood.

5|$|After a time, Himmler {{found that}} the <b>killing</b> <b>methods</b> used by the Einsatzgruppen were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and {{sometimes}} did not kill the victims quickly enough. Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered {{physical and mental health}} problems, and many turned to drink. As much as possible, the Einsatzgruppen leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt. Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part. A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their <b>killing</b> <b>methods</b> and their zeal for the task. Commander of Einsatzgruppe D, SS-Gruppenführer Otto Ohlendorf, particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Animal Health and Welfare was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on welfare aspects of the main systems of stunning and killing of farmed eels in the EU.

The risk assessment was mainly based on expert opinion, due to the limited amount of quantitative and published peer reviewed data {{on the effects of}} the hazards associated with stunning and killing of eels. Pre-slaughter steps, immediately before stunning and killing, which had a direct impact on eel welfare were included in the risk assessment. Stunning and <b>killing</b> <b>methods</b> that are not commercially used in the EU were briefly described but excluded from the risk assessment. For eels there are four methods currently practised in the EU: 1. Whole body electrical stunning in water with desliming and evisceration; 2. Salt bath, desliming and evisceration; 3.
