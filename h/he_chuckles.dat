2500|$|Not much {{is known}} {{of the details of}} his life for the first twenty years or so after he came to Rome. He {{published}} some juvenile poems of which he thought very little in his later years, and <b>he</b> <b>chuckles</b> at a foolish bookseller who would not allow them to die a natural death [...] Martial had neither youthful passion nor youthful enthusiasm to precociously mold him a poet. His faculty ripened through the seasons with careworn experience and with the time earned knowledge of that social life which was both his theme and his inspiration; many of his best epigrams are among those written in the twilight of his last years. From many answers which he makes to the remonstrances of friendsamong others to those of Quintilianit may be inferred that he was urged to practice at the bar, but that he preferred his own lazy, some would say Bohemian kind of life. He made many influential friends and patrons and secured the favor of both Titus and Domitian. From them he obtained various privileges, among others the semestris tribunatus, which conferred on him equestrian rank. Martial failed, however, in his application to Domitian for more substantial advantages, although he commemorates the glory of having been invited to dinner by him, and also the fact that he procured the privilege of citizenship for many persons on whose behalf he appealed to him.|$|E

6000|$|... (She is {{listening}} through the floor. They all stoop or go {{on their knees}} to listen, {{and when they are}} in this position the RECRUITING SERGEANT enters unobserved. <b>He</b> <b>chuckles</b> aloud. In a moment PHOEBE is alone with him.) ...|$|E
60|$|Old Mr. Toad chuckled {{deep down}} in his throat. <b>He</b> <b>chuckled</b> and <b>chuckled</b> until <b>he</b> shook all over.|$|R
60|$|He {{thought and}} he thought {{and he thought}} and he thought, and little by little a plan worked out in his little black head. Then <b>he</b> <b>chuckled.</b> <b>He</b> <b>chuckled</b> right out loud, then hurriedly looked {{around to see if}} any one had heard him. No one had, so <b>he</b> <b>chuckled</b> again. <b>He</b> cocked his head on one side and half closed his eyes, as if that plan was {{something}} he could see and he was looking at it very hard. Then he cocked his head {{on the other side and}} did the same thing.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>chuckled</b> {{to himself}} and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.|$|R
60|$|LEO. Dont {{take any}} notice of him, Rejjy. Go {{at once and}} get that odious decree {{demolished}} or annulled or whatever it is. Tell Sir Gorell Barnes that I have changed my mind. [To Hotchkiss] I might have known that you were too clever to be really a gentleman. [She takes Reginald away to the oak chest and seats him there. <b>He</b> <b>chuckles.</b> Hotchkiss resumes his seat, brooding].|$|E
6000|$|THE YOUNG LADY (with cool insolence). Well, so you have! (She gets up.) Why shouldn't you? it's your {{business}} to hurt people. (It amuses {{him to be}} treated in this fashion: <b>he</b> <b>chuckles</b> secretly as he proceeds to clean and replace his instruments. She shakes her dress into order; looks inquisitively about her; {{and goes to the}} window.) You have {{a good view of the}} sea from these rooms! Are they expensive? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} do. Not {{that you have}} to laugh at Dr. Kennicott so much, but MY man, heavens, now there's a rare old bird! Reading story-books when he ought to be tending to business! 'Marcus Westlake,' I say to him, 'you're a romantic old fool.' And does he get angry? He does not! <b>He</b> <b>chuckles</b> and says, 'Yes, my beloved, folks do say that married people grow to {{resemble}} each other!' Drat him!" [...] Mrs. Westlake laughed comfortably.|$|E
60|$|I {{could see}} that Holmes was {{extremely}} pleased, for <b>he</b> <b>chuckled</b> and rubbed his hands together.|$|R
60|$|Nutty {{took his}} astonishment, which was {{too great to}} be concealed, as a compliment. <b>He</b> <b>chuckled.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>chuckled</b> immensely at {{the bright}} {{prospect}} of immortality that had suddenly opened up to him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She had got a wire. That isn't the joke, though. You see he {{got into}} a hopeless muddle about {{which side of the}} veil he had come out on; and he went off with the other ones, and they wouldn't have him, and he got lost in the veil, running up and down it, calling to us; and just for the lark we didn't answer.' <b>He</b> <b>chuckles,</b> 'I expect he has become a ghost!' With sudden consideration, 'Best not tell his mother that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tease him! The {{consideration}} I {{show that}} poor old man, Grizel, while I {{know all the}} time that he is plotting to diddle me! You should see me when it is he who is fidgeting to know why the piano has stopped. He stretches his head to listen, and does something to his ear that sends it another inch nearer the door; <b>he</b> <b>chuckles</b> and groans on the sly; and I--I notice nothing. Oh, he is becoming quite fond of me; he thinks me an idiot." ...|$|E
6000|$|They found M. Peyron {{very much}} excited, partly by Ula's news of Tu-Kila-Kila's attitude, but more still by Methuselah's {{agitated}} condition. [...] "The whole night through, my dear friends," [...] he cried, seizing their hands, [...] "that bird has been chattering, chattering, chattering. Oh, mon Dieu, quel oiseau! It {{seems as though}} the words heard yesterday from mademoiselle had struck some lost chord in the creature's memory. But he is also very feeble. I can see that well. His garrulity is the garrulity of old age in its last flickering moments. He mumbles and mutters. <b>He</b> <b>chuckles</b> to himself. If you don't hear his message now and at once, it's my solemn conviction you will never hear it." ...|$|E
60|$|Vernon's {{mind had}} {{returned}} to him glowing and inspired. <b>He</b> <b>chuckled</b> as <b>he</b> underlined his Horace.|$|R
60|$|Sir Thomas' always {{prominent}} eyes protruded still further. The {{color of}} his florid face deepened. Suddenly, <b>he</b> <b>chuckled.</b>|$|R
60|$|As {{the scout}} heard {{the talk about}} himself <b>he</b> <b>chuckled</b> grimly and grasped his rifle tighter than ever.|$|R
60|$|In his palace, {{surrounded}} by all dear delights of the Orient, Ah Chun smokes his placid pipe {{and listens to}} the turmoil overseas. By each mail steamer, in faultless English, typewritten on an American machine, a letter goes from Macao to Honolulu, in which, by admirable texts and precepts, Ah Chun advises his family to live in unity and harmony. As for himself, {{he is out of}} it all, and well content. He has won to peace and repose. At times <b>he</b> <b>chuckles</b> and rubs his hands, and his slant little black eyes twinkle merrily at the thought of the funny world. For out of all his living and philosophizing, that remains to him--the conviction that it is a very funny world.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is always}} a wind in Holland; it comes from over the sea. There is nothing to stay its progress. It leaps the low dykes and sweeps with a shriek across the sad, soft dunes, and thinks {{it is going to}} have a good time and play havoc in the land. But the Dutchman laughs behind his great pipe as it comes to him {{shouting}} and roaring. [...] "Welcome, my hearty, welcome," [...] <b>he</b> <b>chuckles,</b> [...] "come blustering and bragging; the bigger you are the better I like you." [...] And when it is once in the land, behind the long, straight dykes, behind the waving line of sandy dunes, he seizes hold of it, and will not let it go till it has done its tale of work.|$|E
6000|$|... "How? Why, old Hildebrandt {{says to me}} and Bill this afternoon: 'Boys, one riddle have I for you gehabt haben. A {{young man}} who cannot riddles antworten, he is not so good by {{business}} for ein family to provide--is not that--hein?' And he hands us a riddle--a conundrum, some calls it--and <b>he</b> <b>chuckles</b> interiorly and gives both of us till to-morrow morning {{to work out the}} answer to it. And he says whichever of us guesses the repartee end of it goes to his house o' Wednesday night to his daughter's birthday party. And it means Laura for whichever of us goes, for she's naturally aching for a husband, and it's either me or Bill Watson, for old Hildebrant likes us both, and wants her to marry somebody that'll carry on the business after he's stitched his last pair of traces.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>chuckled</b> again, that silent {{interior}} laugh, and I {{was certainly}} grinning in sympathy {{as he went}} on.|$|R
60|$|All {{the time}} Striped Chipmunk was saying this his sharp little eyes twinkled with {{mischief}} and <b>he</b> <b>chuckled</b> softly to himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Too late to-day. Time I {{was home}} now. It'll keep until to-morrow," [...] he muttered. Then <b>he</b> <b>chuckled,</b> and <b>he</b> was still <b>chuckling</b> when <b>he</b> reached the big hemlock tree, among the thick {{branches}} {{of which he}} spent each night.|$|R
6000|$|He {{requests}} {{me now to}} {{open the}} lantern, which I do, and the light streams out upon the wet sod. At last divining his proceedings I say that I had no idea, in keeping the tryst, {{that he was going}} to do more at such an unusual time than meet me for a meditative ramble through the stronghold. I ask him why, having a practicable object, he should have minded interruptions and not have chosen the day? He informs me, quietly pointing to his spade, that it was because his purpose is to dig, then signifying with a grim nod the gaunt notice-post against the sky beyond. I inquire why, as a professed and well-known antiquary with capital letters at the tail of his name, he did not obtain the necessary authority, considering the stringent penalties for this sort of thing; and <b>he</b> <b>chuckles</b> fiercely again with suppressed delight, and says, 'Because they wouldn't have given it!' ...|$|E
60|$|Look {{under the}} crimson sumach yonder, {{there in the}} bit of brown grass, with the purple asters hanging over, {{and you will find}} his form, where he has been sitting all the morning and where he watched you {{all the way up the}} hill. But you need not follow; you will not find him again. He never runs straight; the swaying leaves there where he {{disappeared}} mark the beginning of his turn, whether to right or left you will never know. Now he has come around his circle and is near you again--watching you this minute, out of his bit of brown grass. As you move slowly away in the direction he took, peering here and there among the bushes, Bunny behind you sits up straight in his old form again, with his little paws held very prim, his long ears pointed after you, and his deep brown eyes shining like the waters of a hidden spring among the asters. And <b>he</b> <b>chuckles</b> to himself, and thinks how he fooled you that time, sure.|$|E
60|$|How {{different}} in character from his song {{is that of}} the gallant little black-cap in the tree above him. A gentleman he is of a most ancient house, perhaps the oldest of European singing birds. How perfect must have been the special organization which has spread seemingly without need of alteration or improvement, from Norway to the Cape of Good Hope, from Japan to the Azores. How many ages must have passed since his forefathers first got their black caps. And how intense and fruitful must have been the original vitality which, after so many generations, can still fill that little body with so strong a soul, and make him sing as Milton's new-created birds sang to Milton's Eve in Milton's Paradise. Sweet he is, and various, rich, and strong, beyond all English warblers, save the nightingale: but his speciality is his force, his rush, his overflow, not so much of love as of happiness. The spirit carries him away. He riots up and down the gamut till he cannot stop himself; his notes tumble over each other; <b>he</b> <b>chuckles,</b> laughs, shrieks with delight, throws back his head, droops his tail, sets up his back, and sings with every fibre of his body: and yet he never forgets his good manners. He is never coarse, never harsh, for a single note. Always graceful, always sweet, he keeps perfect delicacy in his most utter carelessness.|$|E
60|$|He {{never came}} out of the entrance, of that I was certain; yet at the end of several minutes <b>he</b> <b>chuckled</b> at my elbow. Again I ran after him, and again he ran into the cave; but this time I stopped at the mouth. I dropped back a short {{distance}} and watched. He did not come out, yet, as before, <b>he</b> <b>chuckled</b> at my elbow and was chased by me a third time into the cave.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fooled {{you that}} time, didn't I, Peter?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>chuckled.</b> [...] "You {{thought you were}} going to see Glory the Cardinal, didn't you?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} looked at her, and at Nikasti, who out in the {{corridor}} was holding his hat and cane. Then <b>he</b> <b>chuckled.</b>|$|R
6000|$|BELLO: You {{will make}} the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the {{different}} rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! You will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (<b>He</b> <b>chuckles)</b> My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all, when they come here {{the night before the}} wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points) For that lot. Trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face) Here wet the deck and wipe it round! ...|$|E
6000|$|Spiders of {{both sexes}} kept their nets at Gretna Green, but a tragedy was only enacted at the hall between a score of comedies; and they were {{generally}} love-sick youths and maidens who interrupted the priest to ask if {{that was not the}} [...] "so--sound of wh--wheels on the gravel walk?" [...] A couple whom it would almost have been a satisfaction to marry without a fee (for the mere example of the thing) was that which raced from the south of England with the lady's father. When they reached the top of a hill his arms were gesticulating at the bottom, and they never turned one corner without seeing his steaming horse take another. Poor was the fond lover (dark his prospects at Gretna Green in consequence) but brave the maid, to whom her friends would insist on leaving money, which was the cause of the whole to-do. The father, looking on the swain with suspicious eye, took to dreaming of postillions, high-roads, blacksmiths and Gretna Green. He would not suffer his daughter to move from his sight, and even to dances he escorted her in his private carriage, returning for her (for he was a busy man) at night. Quick of invention were the infuriated lovers. Threading the mazes of a dance, the girl was one evening snatched from her partner's arms by the announcement that her father's carriage barred the way below. A hurried explanation of why he had come so soon, a tripping down the stairs with trembling limbs into a close coach, a maiden in white in her lover's arms, and hey-ho for Gretna Green. Jardine is mellowed with a gentle cynicism, and sometimes he breaks off in his reminiscences to wonder what people want to be married for. The Springfield priest, <b>he</b> <b>chuckles,</b> is a blacksmith at whom love cannot afford to laugh. Ay, friend Jardine, but what about the blacksmith who laughs at love? ...|$|E
6000|$|The lasagnone is a loafer, as an Italian {{can be a}} loafer, {{without the}} {{admixture}} of ruffianism, which blemishes most loafers of northern race. He may be quite worthless, and even impertinent, but he cannot be a rowdy,-- that pleasing blossom on the nose of our fast, high-fed, thick-blooded civilization. In Venice he must not be confounded with other loiterers at the caffè; not with the natty people who talk politics interminably over little cups of black coffee; not with those old habitués, who sit forever under the Procuratie, their hands folded upon the tops of their sticks, and staring at the ladies who pass with a curious steadfastness and knowing skepticism of gaze, not pleasing in the dim eyes of age; certainly, the last persons who bear any likeness to the lasagnone are the Germans, with their honest, heavy faces comically anglicized by leg-of- mutton whiskers. The truth is, the lasagnone does not flourish in the best caffè; he comes to perfection in cheaper resorts, for he is commonly not rich. It often happens that a glass of water, flavored with a little anisette, is the order over which he sits a whole evening. He knows the waiter intimately, and does not call him [...] "Shop!" [...] (Bottega,) as less familiar people do, but Gigi, or Beppi, as the waiter is pretty sure to be named. [...] "Behold!" [...] he says, when the servant places his modest drink before him, [...] "who is that loveliest blonde there?" [...] Or to his fellow-lasagnone: [...] "She regards me! I have broken her the heart!" [...] This is his sole business and mission, the cruel lasagnone--to break ladies the heart. He spares no condition,--neither rank nor wealth is any defense against him. I often wonder what is in that note he continually shows to his friend. The confession of some broken heart, I think. When he has folded it, and put it away, <b>he</b> <b>chuckles</b> [...] "Ah, cara!" [...] and sucks at his long, slender Virginia cigar. It is unlighted, for fire consumes cigars. I never see him read the papers,--neither the Italian papers nor the Parisian journals, though {{if he can get}} [...] "Galignani" [...] he is glad, and he likes to pretend to a knowledge of English, uttering upon occasion, with great relish, such distinctively English words as [...] "Yes" [...] and [...] "Not," [...] and to the waiter, [...] "A- little-fire-if-you-please." [...] He sits very late in the caffè, and he touches his hat--his curly French hat--to the company as he goes out with a mild swagger, his cane held lightly in his left hand, his coat cut snugly to show his hips, and genteelly swaying with the motion of his body. He is a dandy, of course,--all Italians are dandies,--but his vanity is perfectly harmless, and his heart is not bad. He would go half an hour {{out of his way to}} put you in the direction of the Piazza. A little thing can make him happy,--to stand in the pit at the opera, and gaze at the ladies in the lower boxes--to attend the Marionette, or the Malibran Theatre, and imperil the peace of pretty seamstresses and contadinas--to stand at the church doors and ogle the fair saints as they pass out. Go, harmless lasagnone, to thy lodging in some mysterious height, and break hearts if thou wilt. They are quickly mended.|$|E
6000|$|Again <b>he</b> <b>chuckled.</b> “Don’t you see there, in the stern-sheets, on the bottom? May I never shoot a seal {{again if}} that ain’t a woman!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is coming}} {{sensible}} again," [...] <b>he</b> <b>chuckled.</b> [...] "Now that that crank {{is out of}} the way we shall see her as she was--triumphant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A great piece, that Miss Lackland of yours," [...] <b>he</b> <b>chuckled.</b> [...] "Claims to be a {{part-owner}} of Berande. Says she's your partner. Is that straight?" ...|$|R
