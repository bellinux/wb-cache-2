50|$|A {{major change}} to the {{valuation}} process for housing benefit was the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>allowance</b> paid to housing benefit claimants, which was introduced on 7 April 2008 {{as part of the}} welfare reform programme. It applies to private sector tenants who make a new claim for housing benefit or those claiming housing benefit who change address. It will also apply to tenants claiming housing benefit who move from the social sector into private sector accommodation. LHA is a standard allowance {{based on the number of}} bedrooms: shared room (room in a shared property); one bedroom, two bedrooms, three bedrooms, four bedrooms and five bedrooms, in an area known as a Broad Rental Market Area (BRMA). It is the median rent of private sector lettings for that size of accommodation in the BRMA.|$|E
5000|$|Dennis Sewell {{states that}} [...] "On {{the day the}} House of Commons met to debate the Beveridge Report in 1943, its author {{slipped out of the}} gallery early in the evening to address a meeting of the Eugenics Society at the Mansion House. ... His report he was keen to reassure them, was eugenic in intent and would prove so in effect. ... The idea of child {{allowances}} had been developed within the society with the twin aims of encouraging the educated professional classes to have more children than they currently did and, at the same time, {{to limit the number of}} children born to poor households. For both effects to be properly stimulated, the allowance needed to be graded: middle-class parents receiving more generous payments than working-class parents. ... The Home Secretary had that very day signalled that the government planned a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> of child <b>allowance.</b> But Beveridge alluding to the problem of an overall declining birth rate, argued that even the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> would be eugenic. Nevertheless, he held out hope for the purists. 'Sir William made it clear that it was in his view not only possible but desirable that graded family allowance schemes, applicable to families in the higher income brackets, be administered concurrently with his <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> scheme,' reported the Eugenics Review.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{what should be}} the effects of the {{introduction}} of a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> tax in Belgium. According to the principles of a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> tax system, <b>allowances,</b> credits and exemptions that are considered as tax expenditures are repealed and the progressive tax schedule is replaced by a single marginal tax rate that applies above a zero-rate bracket. There is no deduction for savings and tax credits for children stay in place. The reform is budgetary neutral. We first run a micro-simulation model for personal income taxation. This means that the final withholding tax on income from savings and the corporate income tax rate remain unchanged. The results indicate strong adverse effects on income distribution. In a second stage, we use out-of-model statistical information to simulate the effects of a full <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> system in which the top marginal PIT rate, the final withholding tax on interests and the CIT rate are equalised. Base broadening also applies to the taxation of savings and to corporate income tax. The strong adverse effect on income distribution remains but in addition to this, the tax burden is shifted from income subject to PIT to income from savings. On the efficiency side, high-income earners enjoy the largest cuts while the drop in average income tax rates for low-income earners may result in a positive participation effect. Taxation of savings is more neutral under the contemplated tax reform. JEL codes: H 20, H 21, H 23, H 24, H 25. ...|$|R

3000|$|We {{find that}} cost cap tariffs {{should never be}} chosen over {{pay-per-use}} or <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> plans if consumers are certain about their preferences and consequently in their demand. In this case, the cost cap tariff is always dominated by either the pay-per-use plan or the <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> However, if consumers have uncertainty in their preferences, the cost cap tariff may generate a higher (expected) consumer surplus than a pay-per-use plan or a <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> This holds true even though consumers are charged more at the margin than in a pay-per-use tariff and the maximum possible bill amount is higher under a cost cap compared to a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> tariff. This is because the cost cap tariff does not only provide cost insurance in case of high demand (like a <b>flat</b> <b>rate),</b> but also cost flexibility in case of low demand (like a pay-per-use tariff). The main research questions that are addressed are (1) under which conditions are cost cap tariffs potentially chosen (over pay-per-use plans and <b>flat</b> <b>rates)?</b> and (2) what {{is the impact of}} demand uncertainty on tariff choice?

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to give insights into the production, income and environmental effects of the introduction of a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> for Dutch agriculture that is lower than the present average direct income payment. For this purpose, a detailed agri-environmental programming model for Dutch agriculture is used. Results of a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> scenario are compared to a reference scenario comparing agricultural production in the Netherlands in 2020 in a situation without a <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> Results show that total gross margin in Dutch agriculture decreases because of the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> with 7 %. The supply of starch potatoes and cow milk decreases most. Production of seed and consumption potatoes, vegetables and intensive livestock products increases slightly. This is largely due to a shift of farm payments from milk and starch potatoes production to arable crops and vegetable production. It was found that including risk aversion of income volatility amplifies these effects. In the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> scenario total emissions of nutrients from agricultural production to the environment decreases...|$|R
