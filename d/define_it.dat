5|$|What {{all these}} {{different}} varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that <b>define</b> <b>it</b> as a kidney.|$|E

25|$|One way of {{defining}} the exponential function for domains {{larger than the}} domain of real numbers is to first <b>define</b> <b>it</b> for the domain of real numbers {{using one of the}} above characterizations and then extend it to larger domains in a way which would work for any analytic function.|$|E
25|$|This {{required}} {{the concept of}} uniform convergence, which was first observed by Weierstrass's advisor, Christoph Gudermann, in an 1838 paper, where Gudermann noted the phenomenon but did not <b>define</b> <b>it</b> or elaborate on it. Weierstrass saw {{the importance of the}} concept, and both formalized it and applied it widely throughout the foundations of calculus.|$|E
25|$|Some people {{accept the}} {{theoretical}} existence of bisexuality but <b>define</b> <b>it</b> narrowly, as being only the equal attraction towards {{both men and}} women. Thus the many bisexual individuals with unequal attractions are instead categorized as either homosexual or heterosexual. Others acknowledge the existence of bisexuality in women, but deny that men can be bisexual.|$|E

25|$|The French {{title of}} this section has been {{retained}} in translation from the French Wikipedia page because the apparently corresponding term in English has {{not quite the same}} meaning. English-speaking historians, though they <b>define</b> <b>it</b> otherwise, in effect, regard the term 'contemporary history' as meaning 'within living memory'. French writers on the other hand, are inclined to open the period with the French Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Article 14 {{does not}} define the offence of {{contempt}} and hence by necessary implication it {{is left to}} the courts to <b>define</b> <b>it.</b> Justice Loh stated that, in defining the offence, judges must be cognizant that the definition must be circumscribed by Article 14, to ensure {{a balance between the}} freedom of speech and the offence. Neither can be defined in a way that renders the other otiose.|$|E
25|$|This model, then, focuses {{mostly on}} “structural factors” {{of the mass}} media, {{including}} “ownership and control, dependence on other major funding sources (notably, advertisers), and mutual interests and relationships between the media and those who make the news and {{have the power to}} <b>define</b> <b>it</b> and explain what it means” (xi). Though the importance of this model and its influence on media studies is not to be denied, later thinkers have criticized this emphasis on structure over agency, because it neglects the ability of audiences of this media to question the prevailing notions represented.|$|E

25|$|The Deccan {{region has}} {{historically}} lacked an enduring geo-political centre, {{and has been}} defined in various ways. Geographers have attempted to <b>define</b> <b>it</b> using indices such as rainfall, vegetation, soil type or physical features. When considering physical features, it is taken to be the area bounded by the Narmada River, the Eastern Ghats and the Western Ghats. The 16th century historian Firishta defined Deccan as the territory inhabited by the native speakers of Kannada, Marathi, and Telugu languages. Richard M. Eaton (2005) also settled on this linguistic definition.|$|E
25|$|The most {{explosive}} growth was experienced in Chabad-Lubavitch, whose head Menachem Mendel Schneerson adopted a modern (he and his disciples ceased wearing the customary Shtreimel) and outreach-centered orientation. At {{a time when}} most Orthodox and Hasidim in particular rejected proselytization, he turned his sect into a mechanism devoted almost solely to it, blurring the difference between actual Hasidim and loosely affiliated supporters until researchers could scarcely <b>define</b> <b>it</b> as a regular Hasidic group. Another phenomenon was the revival of Breslov, which remained without an acting Tzaddiq since the rebellious Rebbe Nachman's 1810 death. Its complex, existentialist philosophy drew many to it.|$|E
25|$|In computing, binary {{trees are}} seldom used solely for their structure. Much more typical is {{to define a}} {{labeling}} function on the nodes, which associates some value to each node. Binary trees labelled this way are used to implement binary search trees and binary heaps, and are used for efficient searching and sorting. The designation of non-root nodes as left or right child even when {{there is only one}} child present matters in some of these applications, in particular it is significant in binary search trees. In mathematics, what is termed binary tree can vary significantly from author to author. Some use the definition commonly used in computer science, but others <b>define</b> <b>it</b> as every non-leaf having exactly two children and don't necessarily order (as left/right) the children either.|$|E

25|$|Greg Madden {{is found}} dead weeks later. In {{the months that}} follow, Zach and Kendall enjoy their time with the newborn child. Problems arise here and there, but none {{like that of the}} Satin Slayer, a serial killer murdering the women of Fusion, a {{cosmetics}} company run by Kendall and her friends who helped to <b>define</b> <b>it.</b> The Satin Slayer takes Kendall hostage, and when it is revealed that the Satin Slayer is actually Zach's estranged father, Alexander Cambias, Sr., thought to be dead, but obviously still very much alive and that all he wanted is for Zach to have followed in his footsteps, Zach does everything in his power to save Kendall, as it all culminates on a balcony outside of a hotel room. Zach's father sets a contraption around Kendall's neck, which will kill her if its detonator goes off. Zach and Alexander struggle as Zach gets a hold of the detonator and will not let it go, even as he is shot in the arm by Alexander. Zach is able to sneak a spare knife from the sheath at his ankle and throw it hard enough at Alexander so that Alexander drops his gun. Zach rescues Kendall. He is determined to kill his father, but help soon arrives, and Alexander is sent to jail.|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} 1990s onwards, the {{majority}} of the population has been part of the growing middle class. But according to Mexico's National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL) from 2006 to 2010 the portion of the population who were in poverty rose from 19% to 46% (52 million persons). However, rather than Mexico’s economy crashing, international economists attribute the huge increase in the percentage of population living below the country's poverty line to the CONEVAL changing the standards used to <b>define</b> <b>it,</b> pointing out that the percentage of people living in poverty according Mexico’s national poverty line is around 40 times higher than the one reported by the World Bank’s international poverty line, with the difference between the two being the biggest in the world. It is pondered then if it wouldn't be better for countries in the situation of Mexico to adopt more internationalized standards to measure poverty so the numbers obtained could be used to make accurate international comparisons. According to the OECD's own poverty line (defined as the percentage of a country's population who earns half or less of the national median income) 21.5% of the Mexico's population lives in situation of poverty. This is also reflected by the fact that infant mortality in Mexico is three times higher than the average among OECD nations, and the literacy levels are in the median range of OECD nations. Nevertheless, according to Goldman Sachs, by 2050 Mexico will have the 5th largest economy in the world.|$|E
