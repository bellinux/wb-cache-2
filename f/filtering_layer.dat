The filter medium of the cast plate is the thick walls, separated by ceramic granules. These features form a rigid mechanical structure.

The coarse part of the equipment provides mechanical strength to its structure while the intermediate layer acts as a membrane carrier. The outer layer membrane acts as a <b>filtering</b> <b>layer.</b> The filtration layer of the ceramic filter has uniform pores, which means that only a certain size of particles can be filtered by using vacuum ceramic filters.|$|E

A recognition-based feedback rule is presented which reflects to each local function its committed errors from a global point of view, and allows to train them together online as perceptrons. As a result, the learned functions automatically behave as filters and rankers, rather than binary classifiers, which we argue to be better {{for this type of}} problems.

40|$|Collision events between 3 D {{objects in}} motion in {{computer}} animations or simulations {{are difficult to}} detect due {{to the difficulty of}} accurately sampling the motion paths of objects in space and time. One approach to this problem has been continuous collision detection but because the current approaches process potentially interacting primitive pairs (PIPPs) redundantly.

Samples were collected from the filter influent, effluent and also from between media layers. Pressure changes across the <b>filter</b> <b>layers</b> were also measured. The solids removal efficiency of the filter varied inversely with the increase in filtration rate. However, the multiple media layers reduced the negative impact of increased HLR in comparison to a single media filter.

40|$|Continuous {{collision}} detection techniques are applied {{extensively in the}} simulation of deformable surfaces, in particular for cloth simulation. Accurate contact information can be computed by using these techniques. Traditionally, for meshed surfaces, after collecting the triangle pairs that are potentially interacting, the feature pairs of these triangles are directly sent for the computation of collision information.

40|$|The {{study of}} scour {{mechanism}} downstream of low-head control structure {{is a fundamental}} topic for hydraulic engineers. Generally, the analysis of scour process is conducted under steady flow conditions, assuming that the maximum discharge is occurring for a time sufficient to guarantee that the equilibrium scour configuration is reached. Nevertheless, generally, the scour process occurs in corre-spondence with a flood event, which is characterized by discharge varying with time.

The single layer of stones serves as one open <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> that has to reduce the wave induced flow and turbulence well {{enough to keep the}} erosion of sand through the <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> within an acceptable amount.

40|$|Breakwaters are {{important}} objects to protect coastal- and harbour areas. To minimalize {{the probability of}} failure of breakwaters, {{a lot of research}} has been conducted concerning the stability of breakwaters. After Iribarren and Hudson, an influential research is conducted by Van der Meer. The literature research of this report will provide more background information concerning their researches on the stability of breakwaters. Van der Meer tested three sorts of breakwater constructions. The first breakwater structure contained a homogeneous construction (P= 0. 6) The second and third structure consisted of respectively a construction with impermeable core (P= 0. 1) and a structure with a <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> and a permeable core (P= 0. 5). These variants of breakwaters were constructed with different slopes angles to require as much information possible concerning the stability of breakwaters. Van der Meer discovered two formulas for the stability of breakwaters. The first formula is used for plunging waves while the second formula is used for surging waves. Within these formulas, important factors as damage, wave height and notional permeability are included. The most important parameter of the formulas of Van der Meer is the notional permeability factor P. Van der Meer conducted his research on three different constructions and has designed a fourth construction based on the stability curves. This fourth construction has a value of permeability of 0. 4. This value is estimated based on curve fitting. Following the research done by Van der Meer, Kik has subsequently researched the notional permeability of three breakwater constructions. Firstly, Kik repeated the test with a construction of impermeable core (model 1 /P= 0. 08) and the test with the construction of <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> and permeable core (model 2 / P= 0. 05) of Van der Meer. Lastly, Kik did a third test existing of a variant of the design of the fourth construction of Van der Meer (model 3 / P= 0. 35). Concluding from his research, Kik stated that the ‘Root mean square equation’ is a reliable method to determine the notional permeability P. During this research the influence of the thickness of the <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> on the notional permeability P is studied. This research will also try to answer the question whether other relevant aspects might influence the notional permeability as well. The elaboration of this research is performed in a practical way in a wave flume in the water laboratory of the faculty of civil engineering of the TU Delft. Scale models of the breakwaters were constructed to test the notional permeability of the breakwaters. In the water laboratory three models were tested. Firstly, model 3 of Kik is repeated as model 3 A, with a calculated value of notional permeability P 0. 38. The construction of model 3 A is build with a top <b>layer,</b> <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> 1, <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> 2 and a impermeable core. Second, another variant of model 3 of Kik is designed and tested (model 4). However, the measured damage figures were too low and therefore they could not be used to calculate a value for the notional permeability P. The construction of model four is build with a top <b>layer,</b> <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> 1, <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> 2 which is thicker as model 3 A and an impermeable core. Finally, model 5 is tested with a calculated value of notional permeability of P 0. 45. This model is designed from the fourth construction of Van der Meer. The construction of model 5 is build with a top <b>layer,</b> <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> 1 and a permeable core with the same material of <b>filter</b> <b>layer</b> 2 of model 3 A and model 4. The results of this research show that the influences of the notional permeability P exists of the ratio of the armour layer thickness and the thickness of the second <b>filter</b> <b>layer.</b> If the layer thicknesses are equal the value for notional permeability P is 0. 38, which follows from model 3 A. If the second layer has an infinite thickness (permeable core), the value for notional permeability P is 0. 45, which follows from model 5. The value of the notional permeability P of model 5 corresponds to the design calculations of the computer model HADEER. Van der Meer discovered using this computer model that the ratio of dn 50 a/ dn 50 f = 5 has a value on the notional permeability P of 0. 43 – 0. 44. During this research, while using two different methods, a value of the notional permeability P of 0. 45 was calculated. coastal engineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
