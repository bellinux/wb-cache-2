Compared to its predecessor, CryoSat-2 features software upgrades, greater battery capacity and an updated <b>instrument</b> <b>package.</b> Its main instrument is an interferometric radar range-finder with twin antennas, which measures the height difference between the upper surface of floating ice and surrounding water. This is often known as 'free-board'.|$|E
25|$|The AMMO shot {{took place}} on 1 July 1958, {{successfully}} intercepting a simulated 650 knot target flying {{at an altitude of}} 100,000 feet and a slant range of 79 miles. The first SNODGRASS round was launched on 14 July with its warhead replaced by an <b>instrument</b> <b>package</b> and launched against a 350-knot Q2A Ryan Firebee I drone. A similar test on 17 July against a 300-knot Q2A destroyed the target with the T45. A dual-launch followed on 24 July, with the first round destroying its target with the T45, and the second with the <b>instrument</b> <b>package</b> flying one second behind. A similar test on 29 July launched two missiles against three F-80 Shooting Star drones flying in formation, the first missile destroyed the lead aircraft while the second passed within lethal range of a second. Testing was unexpectedly cancelled before the W-7 could be fired.|$|E

25|$|For 1963, the Chevy II Nova Super Sport was released, under RPO Z03. It {{featured}} special emblems, <b>instrument</b> <b>package,</b> wheel covers, side moldings, bucket seats, {{and floor}} shifter, and was available {{only on the}} 400 series sport coupe and convertible. Cost of the package was US$161.40, equal to $ today. As mentioned above, the Nova option could not officially have V8 engines at this time—the standard SS engine was the six-cylinder (this was also applicable to the Impala (and later the early Chevelle c. 1964–65) when the SS was a sport and appearance package)—but small-block V8 engine swaps were commonplace among enthusiasts.|$|E
25|$|The primary <b>instrument</b> <b>package</b> (telescope and {{cryogenic}} chamber) {{was developed}} by Ball Aerospace & Technologies, in Boulder, Colorado. The individual instruments were developed jointly by industrial, academic, and government institutions, the principals being Cornell, the University of Arizona, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Ball Aerospace, and Goddard Spaceflight Center. The shorter-wavelength infrared detectors were developed by Raytheon in Goleta, California. Raytheon used indium antimonide and a doped silicon detector {{in the creation of}} the infrared detectors. It is stated that these detectors are 100 times more sensitive than what was once available in the beginning of the project during the 1980s. The far-IR detectors (70 - 160 micrometers) were developed jointly by the University of Arizona and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using Gallium-doped Germanium. The spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin. The mission is operated and managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Spitzer Science Center, located on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, California.|$|E
25|$|As magma {{nears the}} surface and its {{pressure}} decreases, gases escape. This process is much like {{what happens when you}} open a bottle of fizzy drink and carbon dioxide escapes. Sulfur dioxide {{is one of the main}} components of volcanic gases, and increasing amounts of it herald the arrival of increasing amounts of magma near the surface. For example, on May 13, 1991, an increasing amount of sulfur dioxide was released from Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. On May 28, just two weeks later, sulfur dioxide emissions had increased to 5,000 tonnes, ten times the earlier amount. Mount Pinatubo later erupted on June 12, 1991. On several occasions, such as before the Mount Pinatubo eruption and the 1993 Galeras, Colombia eruption, sulfur dioxide emissions have dropped to low levels prior to eruptions. Most scientists believe that this drop in gas levels is caused by the sealing of gas passages by hardened magma. Such an event leads to increased pressure in the volcano's plumbing system and an increased chance of an explosive eruption. A multi-component gas analyzer system (Multi-GAS) is an <b>instrument</b> <b>package</b> used to take real-time high-resolution measurements of volcanic gas plumes. Multi-GAS measurements of CO2/SO2 ratios can allow detection of the pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity.|$|E

2500|$|On December 9, 2013, NASA {{researchers}} described, in {{a series}} of six articles in the journal Science, many new discoveries from the Curiosity rover. [...] Possible organics were found that could not be explained by contamination. Although the organic carbon was probably from Mars, it can all be explained by dust and meteorites that have landed on the planet. [...] Because much of the carbon was released at a relatively low temperature in Curiosity’s Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) <b>instrument</b> <b>package,</b> it probably did not come from carbonates in the sample. [...] The carbon could be from organisms, but this has not been proven. [...] This organic-bearing material was obtained by drilling 5 centimeters deep in a site called Yellowknife Bay into a rock called “Sheepbed mudstone”. [...] The samples were named John Klein and Cumberland. Microbes could be living on Mars by obtaining energy from chemical imbalances between minerals in a process called chemolithotrophy which means “eating rock.” However, in this process only a very tiny amount of carbon is involved — much less than was found at Yellowknife Bay.|$|E

When opera windows were ordered, the script was placed below the [...] "Gran Torino" [...] nameplate on the fenders, and the C-pillar emblem was deleted.
