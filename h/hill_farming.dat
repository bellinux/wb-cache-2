5|$|Farmers exploit {{flocking}} {{behavior to}} keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as <b>hill</b> <b>farming,</b> {{and to move}} them more easily. For this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort, with a highly bred herding ability. Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food. Those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.|$|E
5|$|Ceredigion had {{the largest}} {{population}} growth of any county in Wales, with a 19.5% increase from 1991 to 2003. Tourism and agriculture, chiefly <b>hill</b> <b>farming,</b> {{are the most important}} industries. In addition, two universities are within the county boundaries: Aberystwyth University and the Lampeter campus of the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David. The Welsh Plant Breeding Station is near Aberystwyth and linked to the University. The National Library of Wales, founded in 1907, is also in Aberystwyth. Ceredigion is an extremely rural county; the largest town, Aberystwyth, has fewer than 15,000 permanent residents and the remainder {{of the population of the}} county is scattered over 150 small towns, villages and hamlets.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, the National Agricultural Advisory Service {{was set up}} {{to supply}} {{agricultural}} advice and information. The <b>Hill</b> <b>Farming</b> Act of 1946 introduced for upland areas a system of grants for buildings, land improvement, and infrastructural improvements such as roads and electrification. The Act also continued a system of headage payments for hill sheep and cattle that had been introduced during the war. The Agricultural Holdings Act of 1948 enabled (in effect) tenant farmers to have lifelong tenancies and made provision for compensation in the event of cessations of tenancies. In addition, the Livestock Rearing Act of March 1951 extended the provisions of the 1946 <b>Hill</b> <b>Farming</b> Act to the upland store cattle and sheep sector.|$|E

25|$|A sheepdog trial (also herding event, stock dog {{trial or}} simply dog trial) is a {{competitive}} dog sport in which herding dogs move sheep around a field, fences, gates, or enclosures as directed by their handlers.

25|$|For over a {{thousand}} years {{the basis of the}} economy in the North York Moors was agriculture. The rural scene, which attracts millions of visitors to the park each year, has been formed and maintained by generations of farmers. The 1996 Agricultural Census recorded a total workforce of 2,913 employed on 1,342 working farms. Sheep and cattle provide the prime source of farm income. The dale farms have rights to graze sheep on the open moor. The rights to moorland grazing are often essential to the economic viability of a farm. In recent years agriculture in Britain has suffered economic setbacks and the viability of <b>hill</b> <b>farming</b> has become questionable. A number of environmental schemes to improve farm incomes have been devised but the industry continues to decline.|$|E
500|$|Throughout Churchill's {{second term}} as Prime Minister (1951–55) Home {{remained}} at the Scottish Office, although both Eden at the Foreign Office and Lord Salisbury at the Commonwealth Relations Office invited him to join their ministerial teams. Among the Scottish matters with which he dealt were hydro-electric projects, <b>hill</b> <b>farming,</b> sea transport, road transport, forestry, and the welfare of crofters in the Highlands and the Western Isles. These matters went largely unreported in the British press, {{but the question of}} the royal cypher on Post Office pillar boxes became front-page news. Because Elizabeth I of England was never queen of Scotland, some nationalists maintained when Elizabeth II came to the British throne in 1952 that in Scotland she should be styled [...] "Elizabeth I". Churchill said in the House of Commons that considering the [...] "greatness and splendour of Scotland", and the contribution of the Scots to British and world history, [...] "they ought to keep their silliest people in order". Home nevertheless arranged that in Scotland new pillar boxes were decorated with the royal crown instead of the full cypher.|$|E

2500|$|Only {{about one}} quarter of the land is under {{cultivation}} – mainly in cereals. Barley, wheat and potatoes are grown in eastern parts of Scotland such as Aberdeenshire, Moray, Highland, Fife and the Scottish Borders. The Tayside and Angus area is a centre of production of soft fruits such as strawberries, raspberries and loganberries, owing to the mild climate. [...] Sheep raising is important in the less arable mountainous regions, such as the northwest of Scotland which are used for rough grazing, due to its geographical isolation, poor climate and acidic soils. Parts of the east of Scotland (areas such as Aberdeenshire, Fife and Angus) are major centres of cereal production and general cropping. In such areas, the land is generally flatter, coastal, and the climate less harsh, and more suited to cultivation. The south-west of Scotland – principally Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway – is a centre of dairying. Agriculture, especially cropping in Scotland, is highly mechanised and generally efficient. Farms tend to cover larger areas than their European counterparts. <b>Hill</b> <b>farming</b> is also prominent in the Southern Uplands in the south of Scotland, resulting in the production of wool, lamb and mutton. Cattle-Rearing particularly in the east and south of Scotland results in the production of large amounts of beef. Farming in Scotland was affected by BSE and the European ban on the importation of British beef from 1996. Dairy and Cattle farmers in south-west Scotland were affected by the 2001 UK Foot and Mouth outbreak, which resulted in the destruction of much of their livestock as part of the biosecurity effort to control the spread of the disease.|$|E
