40|$|Abstract — Clutch {{system is}} among the main systems inside a vehicle. Clutch is a {{mechanical}} device located between a vehicle engine and its transmission and provides mechanical coupling between the engine and transmission input shaft. Clutch system comprise of flywheel, <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> plate and friction material, pressure plate, clutch cover, diaphragm spring and the linkage necessary to operate the clutch. The clutch engages the transmission gradually by allowing {{a certain amount of}} slippage between the flywheel and the transmission input shaft. However, the slipping mechanism of the clutch generates heat energy due to friction between the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> and the flywheel. At high sliding velocity, excessive frictional heat is generated which lead to high temperature rise at the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> surface, and this causes thermo-mechanical problems such as thermal deformations and thermo-elastic instability which can lead to thermal cracking, wear and other mode of failure of the <b>clutch</b> <b>disc</b> component. In this project, the modeling of clutch is done in detailed using modeling software. After that the FEM analysis is done for sintered iron friction material. The stresses & deformation obtained for this friction material is then compared to analysis software result. The analysis is done for worn out friction disc.

5000|$|As {{the name}} implies, a cone clutch has conical {{friction}} surfaces. The cone's taper {{means that a}} given amount of movement of the actuator makes the surfaces approach (or recede) much more slowly than in a <b>disc</b> <b>clutch.</b> As well, a given amount of actuating force creates more pressure on the mating surfaces.The best known example of a cone clutch is a synchronizer ring in a manual transmission. The synchronizer ring is responsible for [...] "synchronizing" [...] the speeds of the shift hub and the gear wheel to ensure a smooth gear change.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOptimization {{is the art}} {{of obtaining}} the best results under given circumstances. In design, {{construction}} and maintenance of any engineering system, the ultimate goal is either to minimize the effort required or to maximize the desired benefits. The various processes of optimization come under the subject Operation Research (O. R.). O.

In this project we aim to find the optimum design of a multi <b>disc</b> friction <b>clutch</b> through operations research techniques. The two methods used are stochastic programming and geometric programming. The existing design procedure treats design variables as deterministic ones. In actual practice due to manufacturing tolerances etc. design variables do not remain deterministic but become probabilistic. The probabilistic nature of these should be given proper consideration while designing. This project deals with an approach which takes into account the probabilistic nature of designs variables, as well as probability of satisfying constraint equations.

50|$|The first Boss Hosses offered {{included}} a one-speed manual transmission {{with a standard}} motorcycle hand clutch assisted by a Datsun B210 brake vacuum booster.

The first bikes were chain driven but changed to 1.5 in Dayton belts in the early 1990s. The ratio of the gear box used was 1.53:1. In 1999, a one-speed semi-automatic transmission was available for the motorcycles that utilized a torque converter and a pump {{with a set of}} clutch plates and steels basically added to the previous design gearbox, which worked very well. In 2001, a two-speed semi-automatic transmission with overdrive became standard with a heel-toe shifter and a reverse gear.

5000|$|In 1997, Honda {{introduced}} the NSX's biggest performance upgrades {{for all its}} worldwide markets. Engine displacement increased from 3.0 L to 3.2 L using a thinner fiber-reinforced metal (FRM) cylinder liner. The exhaust manifold was reconfigured and made of stainless steel header pipes rather than a cast-iron manifold for improved performance and lighter weight. The increased flow from this new configuration was a key contributor to the 20 additional horsepower drawn from the new engine. This revised 3.2 L C32B engine gave it slightly more rated power: from [...] to [...] while torque increased from 285 Nm to 305 Nm (manual transmission only). The net result increased the horsepower to weight ratio of the NSX by 7%. The 4-speed automatic model retained its 3.0 L engine and 252 hp power output. Another big change was {{the adoption of a}} 6-speed manual transmission with closer gear ratios and the addition of 3rd to 4th gear dual cone synchronizers. To handle the new engine's added torque and power the small diameter twin-disc clutch system of the 5-speed was replaced by a dual-mass low-inertia single <b>disc</b> <b>clutch</b> system. To offset the weight increase of the new 6-speed transmission and larger brake rotors, which were upped from 11.1 in to 11.732 in, key body parts were made with a new aluminum alloy that was up to 50% stronger allowing thinner lighter material {{to be used in the}} doors, fenders, and front and rear deck lids without any sacrifice of strength. Using this hi-strength alloy the net curb weight increase, despite adding many improvements, was only 22 lbs. Other notable changes included a keyless entry system and vehicle immobilizer system. The combination of slightly increased power and torque and a 6-speed gearbox, with ratios optimized to improve straight-line acceleration, produced better performance numbers over previous models than the modest increases would suggest. Motor Trend and Road and Track (Feb 97) tests of 3.2L 6-speed equipped NSX-T (Targa) roofed cars produced 0-60 mph times of 4.8 and 5.0 seconds and quarter-mile times of 13.3s and 13.5s respectively. 0-60 mph times dropped to as low as 4.5 seconds using a 3.2L hard top coupe model as recorded by Car and Driver in their August 1998 0-150-0 issue. That NSX proved to be the fastest ever tested in North America. When Car and Driver tested the 1999 Zanardi special edition coupe a year later it produced a 4.8s 0-60 and a 13.2s quarter-mile. Although magazine tests for the 02+ models were rare Honda apparently kept improving the engine as Sports and Exotic Car magazine did a farewell article on a 2005 NSX-T and recorded a 0-60 time of 4.7s and a 13.1s quarter-mile.|$|E

2500|$|The harsh {{operating}} {{conditions of the}} arctic seas placed high requirements on the strength, reliability and redundancy of the propulsion machinery, especially for single-screw ships operating independently without icebreaker escort. For this reason the robust propulsion system had several innovative features and prototype arrangements to improve the ship's operational capability. Propulsion power was provided by two 14-cylinder Wärtsilä-Sulzer 14ZV40/48 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines running on heavy fuel oil, each with a maximum continuous output of [...] at 560 rpm. As a precaution against failure of the propeller pitch control mechanism the main engines were directly reversible. The main engines were connected to a single propeller shaft through a double input/single output single-stage reduction gear equipped with separate multi <b>disc</b> <b>clutches</b> and Voith fluid couplings. The hydrodynamic couplings that allowed over 100% slipping between {{input and output shafts}} were used in difficult ice conditions to increase propeller torque and protect the main engines from large torque variations resulting from propeller blades hitting the ice. The fully locking mechanical clutches were used to improve fuel efficiency when the ship was operating in open water or light ice conditions. Because the power output per shaft of the SA-15 class freighters was at that time one of the highest among icebreaking ships, second only to the Arktika class nuclear icebreakers, the propeller of the ship was of extremely robust design. The four-bladed stainless steel controllable-pitch propeller was developed and manufactured by KaMeWa specially for the SA-15 project.|$|R
