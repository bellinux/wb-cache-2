50|$|Occasionally a {{stone or}} foreign object will mar the seat gasket. In this case, most {{hydrants}} {{have a special}} seat wrench that allows removal of the seat to replace the gasket or other broken parts without removing the hydrant from the <b>ground.</b> <b>Hydrant</b> extensions are also available for raising a hydrant if the grade around the hydrant changes. Without extending the height, the wrenches to remove caps would not clear and the break flanges for traffic models would not be located correctly in case they were hit. Hydrant repair kits are also available to repair sacrificial parts designed to break when hit by a vehicle.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{departments}} use the hydrants for flushing out {{water line}} sediments. When doing so, they often use a hydrant diffuser, {{a device that}} diffuses the water {{so that it does}} not damage property and is less dangerous to bystanders than a solid stream. Some diffusers also dechlorinate the water to avoid <b>ground</b> contamination. [...] <b>Hydrants</b> are also sometimes used as entry or exit points for pipe cleaning pigs.|$|R
