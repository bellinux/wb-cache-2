40|$|A {{very unique}} and {{efficient}} pedestal design, {{that has been}} optimized for tracking LEO satellites on frequencies {{up to and including}} Ka-band, is presented. It has a novel three axis geometry that not only provides for full <b>hemispherical</b> <b>coverage</b> but also assures that during tracking, the system never comes closer than 45 degrees to a keyhole. This results in the lowest possible axis speeds and accelerations while enabling the system to track the satellite very accurately. With the trending of the space industry towards big constellations of LEO satellites that produce huge amounts of data, Ka-band is gaining momentum. To serve large constellations of satellites we need significant contact time which translates into a large network of antennas distributed globally. Add to this requirement toe low power capabilities of small satellites and we end up with the demand for large dish diameters to provide an adequate link budget. With traditional pedestal geometries, the cost of a system to meet the demands for LEO Ka-band tracking with large dish diameters becomes prohibitively expensive. So one of the main goals, while designing the antenna system around our novel pedestal, was a minimum lifecycle cost...|$|E

It considers a spacecraft that is continuously above either the North or South Pole and, as such, can provide real-time, continuous and <b>hemispherical</b> <b>coverage</b> of the polar regions.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a detailed mission analysis and systems {{design of a}} near-term and far-term pole-sitter mission. The pole-sitter concept was previously introduced {{as a solution to}} the poor temporal resolution of polar observations from highly inclined, low Earth orbits and the poor high latitude coverage from geostationary orbit. It considers a spacecraft that is continuously above either the North or South Pole and, as such, can provide real-time, continuous and <b>hemispherical</b> <b>coverage</b> of the polar regions. Being on a non-Keplerian orbit, a continuous thrust is required to maintain the pole-sitter position. For this, two different propulsion strategies are proposed, which result in a near-term pole-sitter mission using solar electric propulsion (SEP) and a far-term pole-sitter mission where the SEP thruster is hybridized with a solar sail. For both propulsion strategies, minimum propellant pole-sitter orbits are designed. In order to maximize the spacecraft mass {{at the start of the}} operations phase of the mission, the transfer from Earth to the pole-sitter is designed and optimized assuming either a Soyuz or an Ariane 5 launch. The maximized mass upon injection into the polesitter orbit is subsequently used in a detailed mass budget analysis that will allow for a trade-off between mission lifetime and payload mass capacity. Also, candidate payloads for a range of applications are investigated. Finally, transfers between north and south pole-sitter orbits are considered to overcome the limitations in observations due to the tilt of the polar axis that causes the Poles to be alternately situated in darkness. It will be shown that in some cases these transfers allow for propellant savings, enabling a further extension of the pole-sitter mission...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} {{microwave}} instruments in low Earth orbit (LEO) {{that are used}} for atmospheric temperature and humidity sounding in conjunction with companion IR sounders {{as well as by}} themselves. These instruments have achieved a certain degree of maturity and undergoing a redesign to minimize their size, mass, and power from the previous generation instruments. An example of these instruments is the AMSU-A series, now flying on POES and AQUA spacecraft with the IR sounders HIRS and AIRS. These older microwave instruments are going to be replaced by the ATMS instruments that will fly on NPP and NPOESS satellites with the CrIS sounder. A number of techniques learned from the ATMS project in instrument hardware design and data processing are directly applicable to a similar microwave sounder on a geosynchronous platform. These techniques can significantly simplify the design of a Geostationary orbit (GEO) microwave instrument, avoiding costly development and minimizing the risk {{of not being able to}} meet the scientific requirements. In fact, some of the 'enabling' technology, such as the use of MMIC microwave components (which is the basis for the ATMS' much reduced volume) can be directly applied to a GEO sounder. The benefits of microwave sounders are well known; for example, they penetrate non-precipitating cloud cover and allow for use of colocated IR observations in up to 80 % cloud cover. The key advantages of a microwave instrument in GEO will be the ability to provide high temporal resolution as well as uniform spatial resolution and extend the utility of a colocated advanced IR sounder to cases in which partial cloud cover exists. A footprint of the order of 100 km by 100 km resolution with <b>hemispherical</b> <b>coverage</b> within one hour can be easily achieved for sounding channels in the 50 to 59 GHz range. A GEO microwave sounder will also allow mesoscale sampling of select regions...|$|E
40|$|Circularly {{polarized}} antennas {{are used}} in mobile-satellite or MSAT communication systems. This reduces the polarization mismatch due to the rotational orientation between the transmitter and the receiver and it also minimizes the interference from multipath reflections. Circularly polarized microstrip antennas are commonly used in these systems because of compactness, the light-weight and the low-profile. It eases the installation on a vehicular body or on the surface ofa satellite. This paper presents a circularly polarized microstrip circular patch antenna designed for vehicular use for MSAT communications at a frequency of around I. 6 GHz. It has right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) and near <b>hemispherical</b> <b>coverage</b> needed by the user. The antenna was first simulated using MatLab software for TM 110 resonance mode and fabricated on a substrate of epoxy glass fiber. The antenna was tested on a curved ground plane, which {{was similar to the}} surface of a vehicle. This low profile microstrip antenna is suitable for vehicle rooftop mounting. A combination of the resonance cavity model and the transmission-line model was used to analyze the antenna, which consists of a single circular patch as the driven clement. In order to obtain circular polarization, perturbation segments to the perimeter of the patch were inserted with a single probe feed on the 45 ° axis with respect to the perturbation segments, known as mode-de- tuning. As such no external phasing network is required to obtain the 90 ° time phase difference required for circular polarization. It was fed with a 50 Ω coaxial feed line which was soldered to the inset probe. By adjusting the area of the perturbation segments circular polarization and a good axial ratio was obtained. Half power beam widths of the antenna are 115 ° in the H plane and 105 ° in the E plane. The antenna has a gain of 5. 7 dBi and a bandwidth of 286 MHz which is approximately 17 % of the centre frequency. The design criteria and performance of the circularly polarized microstrip antenna, which is suitable for MSAT communications, are presented...|$|E
40|$|Air {{quality is}} an {{international}} issue {{which has been the}} subject of several European directives on pollution levels as atmospheric pollutants can have significant effects on human health, ecosystems and climate change, especially at high levels. In the UK the largest sources of atmospheric pollutants are products of combustion from power generation and motor vehicles including NO[subscript x] (NO and NO[subscript 2]), CO, VOCs and particulate matter. Hence it is becoming increasingly important to measure changes in these air pollutants especially in urban areas where these pollutants are at the highest levels. Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy is now commonly used as an air quality tool; primarily through the measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO[subscript 2]). CityScan is a Hemispherical Scanning Imaging Differential Optical Absorption Spectrometer (HSI-DOAS) which has been optimised to measure concentrations of NO[subscript 2]. This thesis will describe the development and subsequent deployment of three CityScan instruments and the first results from these deployments. CityScan has a 95 ° field of view (FOV) between the zenith and 5 ° below the horizon. Across this FOV there are 128 resolved elements which are measured concurrently, the spectrometer is rotated azimuthally 1 ° per second providing full <b>hemispherical</b> <b>coverage</b> every 6 minutes. Three CityScan instruments were built between 2009 and 2012 and deployed in various locations, including Leicester, London and Bologna. Data from one of these instruments has been validated with a MAX-DOAS instrument (TROPOGAS) and in situ monitors. The comparison with the TROPOGAS instrument produced gradient values between 0. 7 and 1 with R² values rarely lower than 0. 7. An NO[subscript 2] detection limit of CityScan has been calculated to be 4 x 10 [superscript 15] mol cm[superscript - 2]. The extensive field of view of the CityScan instruments has allowed NO[subscript 2] concentrations to be mapped on city-wide scales allowing areas of high and low pollution to be identified with a spatial resolution which has never been possible before without the use of models...|$|E
40|$|Hemispherical scan coverage, {{where the}} antenna beam may be {{positioned}} anywhere above horizon, {{is required in}} many applications such as satellite communications, and surveillance and tracking radar systems. This work involves the modelling and design of multi-faceted antenna arrays for providing general <b>hemispherical</b> <b>coverage.</b> Two classes of multi-faceted antenna arrays are used, namely, pyramids and pyramidal frusta, and four stages of their design process are considered. The first stage concerns the geometric design of the antenna and presents simple and novel methods to determine the optimal antenna geometry. Investigations of how the maximum scan angle is affected by far-field approximation and {{by the number of}} faces are also presented. The second stage focuses on the design of the circularly polarized circular patch antenna element. Its polarization purity is investigated over angular sectors about broadside. The results show that there is a well-defined optimal patch size which produces extremely pure polarization. This size corresponds to specific low values of the relative substrate permittivity. The third stage deals with the design of the planar array supported by each of the antenna faces. It presents a comparison between the two methods typically used to compute the element spacing over all coverage ranges and using different antenna configurations. The final stage presents a performance evaluation framework which compares planar, pyramidal, and pyramidal frustum arrays. Four increasingly detailed levels of evaluation are performed: using the geometric structure only; then incorporating the array factor; and finally including both the modelled; and the simulated element patterns. The results demonstrate that the performance advantages of multi-faceted arrays over planar arrays increase as the coverage range becomes wider and/or closer to horizon, and when the directional radiation characteristics of the antenna element are considered. They also show that no clear improvement is gained by using more than about 10 faces, given the added area, cost, and complexity involved. Moreover, under most circumstances, there is no significant difference in performance among pyramids with 4 to 7 faces or among pyramidal frusta with 5 to 9 faces...|$|E
