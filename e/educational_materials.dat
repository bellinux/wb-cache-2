Innovative programs were developed because their target audience, children and their families in low-income, inner-city homes, did not traditionally watch educational programs on television and because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups.|$|E

5|$|Students in Malawi have {{expressed}} {{high levels of}} dissatisfaction regarding the HIV/AIDS-related education and support they receive at school. According to a survey of students in Malawi, most secondary students {{do not believe that}} the HIV/AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease. Although the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV/AIDS in schools, there is still a significant shortage of age-appropriate audio and visual <b>educational</b> <b>materials</b> relating to HIV/AIDS available to instructors, particularly in rural areas. In addition, most teachers cannot identify the students in their classes who have been personally affected by the epidemic, either through friends or relatives, which suggests that school-based support for HIV/AIDS is minimal. However, despite this lack of support, surveys indicate that children who have been affected by the epidemic do not usually experience HIV/AIDS-based discrimination at school.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1970s, the CTW's main non-television efforts {{changed from}} {{promotion}} {{to the development}} of <b>educational</b> <b>materials</b> for preschool settings. Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. During the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting during 2006, the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.|$|E

The lecturer often constructs and manages the variants separately with ad hoc reuse. This scheme of reuse raises a problem of consistency among multiple variants.

Separation of common parts and variable parts in the <b>educational</b> <b>material</b> enable generation of variants depending on reuse scene. We design and implement a generation tool to evaluate the scheme...|$|R

The questionnaire measures students’ knowledge and attitudes about waste management. The questionnaire was filled by students twice in order to increase its reliability and validity. The effectiveness of the <b>educational</b> <b>material</b> of waste management was examined with the method of pretest and posttest with experimental and control group. The <b>educational</b> <b>material</b> was implemented as environmental education programme in Gymnasiums (N= 64), Lyceums (N= 83) and Technical Lyceum (N= 10). The <b>educational</b> <b>material</b> helped students to improve their knowledge for the management of garbage. Similar improvement was not observed in attitudes of students. The <b>educational</b> <b>material</b> for waste management was also implemented within the frame of “supple zone’’ in Gymnasium (N= 51). The <b>educational</b> <b>material</b> helped students to improve their knowledge and their attitudes for the waste management. Teachers (N= 21) and students (N= 198) have had a positive opinion about the <b>educational</b> <b>material</b> of waste management. The third version of the questionnaire was filled by students of third class of Gymnasium (N= 597) and of first class of Lyceum (N= 461) in order to examine students’ knowledge and attitudes about waste management. It was found that students of Gymnasium and Lyceum had environmentally friendly attitudes about waste management. The independent variables of sex, participation in environmental education programme and school performance influence students’ attitudes toward waste management. Parents’ education level and students’ school performance influence students’ knowledge about waste management. ...|$|R
