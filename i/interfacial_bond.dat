The goal {{of this research was}} to characterize the fatigue behavior of the fiber/matrix <b>interfacial</b> <b>bond</b> in candidate FRP composite biomaterial systems in simulated in vivo environments. ^ A miniature mechanical test machine was developed (and patented) to characterize the fracture behavior of the fiber/matrix <b>interfacial</b> <b>bond.</b> The fiber/matrix combinations selected for study were carbon fiber/polysulfone (CF/PSF), carbon fiber/polycarbonate (CF/PC), Kevlar 49 fiber/polysulfone (K 49 /PSF), and Kevlar 49 fiber/polycarbonate (K 49 /PC). The interface was characterized in terms of both ultimate and dynamic fatigue strength in three separate environments (37 ∘C dry air, saline, and inflammatory exudate) utilizing a single fiber pull-out test method. ^ Test results show the CF interfaces to possess greater ultimate bond strength (UBS) and fatigue strength (FS) than the K 49 interfaces with each matrix type. The PC and PSF matrix <b>interfacial</b> <b>bond</b> strengths were found to be approximately equivalent for a given fiber type. The UBS and FS were found to be significantly decreased by both saline and exudate exposure with no significant difference being found in the saline and exudate environments. The fatigue results show a linear relationship between applied shear stress and the logarithm of fatigue life (cycles to failure) for each FRP system. SEM photographs of the site of debonding reveal that bond failure occurred primarily by adhesive failure at the interface in the UBS test while fatigue debonding occurred by a mixture of both adhesive and matrix cohesive failure. ^ Methods have been successfully developed for the dynamic fatigue characterization of the fiber/matrix <b>interfacial</b> <b>bond</b> utilizing a single fiber pull-out test. <b>Interfacial</b> <b>bond</b> ultimate and fatigue strength characterization in simulated in vivo environments should prove useful for the development of fatigue resistant FRP composite biomaterials for long term structural orthopaedic implant use. ...|$|E

The latest {{experimental}} study on steel reinforced high strength and high performance concrete (SRHSHPC) specimens {{shows that there}} exists <b>interfacial</b> <b>bond</b> softening phenomenon between embedded steel and high strength and high performance concrete (HSHPC), and it makes the shear transfer capacity between shaped steel and HSHPC be progressively reduced. To predict failure load in design, a theoretical model for <b>interfacial</b> <b>bond</b> softening behavior is required. As <b>interfacial</b> <b>bond</b> softening behavior is a nonlinear process involving material properties, it can be analyzed once the relation of <b>interfacial</b> <b>bond</b> stress (τ) and slippage (s) is known.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Ph. D. work is to {{investigate}} the adhesion and de-adhesion of organic coatings on galvanized steel substrate. Chapter 1 introduces the project aim and research outline. Chapter 2 investigates Zn oxide semiconductor properties as the major compound formed on galvanized steel. The results showed a clear effect of surface treatment on Zn oxide doping concentration and flatband potential. Moreover, an obvious relation between Zn oxide composition and flatband potential was detected. The deposition mechanism of Zr-based conversion coatings, as potential replacement of the existing conversion coatings, on differently pretreated Zn surfaces has been studied in chapter 3. It was found that Zr deposition rate and {{the composition of the}} obtained conversion layer strongly depend on the initial hydroxyl fraction and surface roughness. Studying the metal-polymer <b>interfacial</b> <b>bonding</b> is extremely difficult due to the relatively high polymer thickness masking the interface region. Consequently, the metal-polymer interfaces are modeled in chapters 4 - 7 by adsorption of the representative molecules. Chapter 4 compares the adsorption properties of carboxylic based molecules on Zn and Fe substrates. It was shown that the obtained interfacial configurations are different on Zn and Fe substrates. In this case, one end adsorption of succinic acid molecules was promoted on Fe, while adsorption of Zn was conducted mainly with both ends. Consequently, Zn was selected for continuation of the research to explore more details of the interfacial properties. Chapter 5 examines the effects of an external potential on adsorption properties of the carboxylic model compounds. The results showed that the applied potential slightly increases the amount of adsorbates, which may contribute to a better adhesion. Moreover, the applied potential increases one-end adsorption of succinic acid molecules due to a C-C bonding cleavage. Desorption of the formed carboxylates was examined by means of cyclic voltammetry in chapter 6. It was shown that the molecular type and surface pretreatment affect the desorption process and consequently the <b>interfacial</b> <b>bonding</b> strength. It was found the metal-polymer interaction is accompanied by an electron exchange in the interfacial region. Consequently, scanning Kevin probe (SKP) measurements were performed to evaluate the Volta potential changes due to the adsorption. The results showed that the amount of electron transfer is correlated to the <b>interfacial</b> <b>bonding</b> density and molecular chain length. Additionally, an effect of adsorption configuration was detected on the obtained Volta potential shift. In the next step, the <b>interfacial</b> <b>bonding</b> properties of the real carboxylic coatings and Zn substrate were evaluated in chapters 8 - 10. Chapter 8 assesses the <b>interfacial</b> <b>bonding</b> of the residue polymer layers obtained after a dedicated polymer removal procedure. A comparable <b>interfacial</b> <b>bonding</b> mechanism was detected for the real coatings and model compounds applied on Zn surfaces. Chapter 9 investigates in-situ the <b>interfacial</b> <b>bonding</b> formation upon application of the polymers on Zn surfaces in a Kretschmann geometry. An equivalent <b>interfacial</b> <b>bonding</b> mechanism was detected compared to those obtained through the adsorption of the model compounds and residue layers.

The <b>interfacial</b> <b>bonding</b> degradation was examined by means of an integrated ATR-FTIR and EIS set-up in a Kretschmann geometry and described in chapter 10. The results showed a beneficial role of the polymerization process in the formation of lateral bondings blocking water penetration through the polymer structure.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Presently {{there is}} great {{interest}} in understanding and improving the bond-ing between the fibers and matrix in high performance composite materials. Indeed, the fiber-matrix adhesion in many recently-developed systems is poor. To improve bonding, various fiber surface treatments have been developed.

The effects of corrosion ratio, sustained load and lateral confinement on the bond behavior were tested and analyzed.
