5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used <b>in</b> <b>foods</b> to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of syngas to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative lactic acid production. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1Mt/a and declining, while Japanese production was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in production is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOver {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} an incessant rise <b>in</b> global <b>food</b> prices; this {{increase}} <b>in</b> <b>food</b> prices has been associated with the recent discovery of petroleum product substitute “ethanol”. Since bio-ethanol is mainly produced from food crops such as sugar cane and corn, the increase in the demand for these food crops for ethanol production particularly by emerging markets such as china has imposed enormous pressure on demand for food and food prices. This study investigates the impact of increase <b>in</b> <b>food</b> prices on global economic growth; using food producer price and consumer price index as a proxy, this study examines the gain on the producer side and the loss on consumer side from this increase <b>in</b> <b>food</b> prices and how this gain and loss has impact economic growth.
