50|$|The chip heater {{consisted}} of a cylindrical unit with a <b>fire</b> <b>box</b> and flue, through which a water pipe was run.

5000|$|Perhaps {{his most}} {{recognizable}} innovation, per Railway Age Gazette, was {{the relocation of}} the steam locomotive boiler and <b>fire</b> <b>box.</b> Prior to the 1881-3 design of the Pennsylvania's Class K 4-4-0 American Standard steam locomotives (later reclassified to the Pennsylvania's Class D6 4-4-0 American Standards), most <b>fire</b> <b>boxes</b> were located between the frames of locomotives, restricting their width, and thus, {{the power of the}} locomotive. Ely's design moved the <b>fire</b> <b>box</b> and boiler assembly above the drive wheels, creating a design which was more powerful, as well as easier to stoke. The area available to burn coal, and thus power the locomotive, was increased from eighteen to nearly thirty-five square feet. The change, considered radical at the time, created a design which observers believed would run roughly and prove top-heavy and unstable. Railway Age Gazette noted in 1911: ...|$|R
